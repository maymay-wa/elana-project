defying a government policy that promotes 
cremation rural chinese are building tombs so deluxe that some 
people are actually setting up house in them an official newspaper 
said today 
the china daily said one farmer spent 540 or about four times 
the per capita annual income in the countryside to prepare for his 
parents a final resting place fashioned out of 3000 bricks and 37 
tons of stone 
in coastal zhejiang province one farmer was found living in a 
fourroom tomb he had built for himself his wife and his late 
parents the tomb came equipped with electric lights 
the communist government has long urged chinese to abandon their 
traditional burial practices in favor of cremation burial the 
government contends is a serious drain on land resources in a 
country with 23 percent of the worlds population but only 5 percent 
of the earths arable land 
although most city people are now cremated there has been strong 
resistance to cremation in more conservative rural areas the 
defiance has increased in recent years as newly affluent villagers 
seek to honor the dead with large banquets buddhist ceremonies and 
impressive burial sites 
funeral catering services are booming while crematoria are 
closing for lack of business or dependent on government subsidies 
according to official reports 
entrepreneurs in the scenic city of hangzhou last year built 
1000 tombs almost all for overseas chinese willing to pay large 
sums to bury their remains in the motherland 
of the 6 million chinese who died in 1987 only 16 million or 
27 percent were cremated 
the englishlanguage china daily said that in the hunan county 
140 people had been injured in disputes over limited space for 
burials

an astronaut scheduled to command a shuttle 
mission this year denied a published report that he failed two tests 
for colorblindness and another astronaut called the allegation of 
colorblindness absurd 
however daniel c brandenstein chief of the astronaut corps at 
the johnson space center did not specifically deny that he is 
colorblind a condition that would have disqualified him from flying 
in space 
brandenstein who is to command a mission this year made his 
comments monday following a story in the houston chronicle the 
previous day that said he and astronaut frederick c hauck received 
waivers for medical conditions that would have otherwise grounded 
them 
hauck commanded the first postchallenger mission 
on tuesday the houston post reported that an anonymous caller to 
the newspaper said the astronaut had failed a standard 
colorblindness test in 1987 and then failed the farnsworth lantern 
test also for colorblindness 
without going into detail its not accurate brandenstein 
was quoted as saying in the article 
brandenstein said the claims about his vision are contrary to his 
performance as a navy pilot who has made 400 carrier landings 
i have a long record of operational flying in the navy with no 
problem he added 
hauck would not discuss reports he had kidney stone problems but 
he did say the allegation dan brandenstein is colorblind is 
absurd 
james c fletcher nasas chief administrator refused to comment 
on the medical records of brandenstein and hauck but he issued a 
statement from washington saying i am confident that the system 
has not been abrogated and that no one flies without qualifying by 
the book 
fletcher like other nasa officials said he would not discuss 
any individual medical records on the grounds that such records are 
legally a private matter 
the chronicle citing unidentified sources at the johnson space 
center said hauck underwent special medical treatment last year to 
dissolve kidney stones and brandenstein received a waiver earlier 
keeping him on flight status despite colorblindness

two groups of farmers fought a 
gunbattle over land in a remote town in southern mexico and at least 
nine people were killed authorities said 
state officials said eight of the dead were among a group about 
100 campesinos who occupied a 500acre tract in december after 
losing an eightyear legal battle over the land 
the ninth was one of 83 campesinos who together own a 7000acre 
cattle ranch near pijijiapa that includes the disputed land 
the owners tried to run off the occupying peasants according to 
official accounts of sundays clash 490 miles southeast of mexico 
city in chiapas state 
the farmers occupying the land belong to the leftist independent 
center for farm laborers and campesinos while the owners belong to 
the national campesino confederation part of the governing 
institutional revolutionary party 
there is no doubt that the criminal action with the use of 
sophisticated weapons as well as the decision to kill the 
campesinos was generated by the group of property owners gov 
patrocinio gonzalez was quoted as saying in tuesdays editions of 
the mexico city newspaper la jornada 
he said ak47 automatic rifles were used 
campesinos occupying the land had petitioned for about 2500 
acres for expansion of their cooperative farm enrique vazquez a 
leader of the independent center said tuesday 
under the mexican agrarian reform system campesinos may petition 
for the use of privatelyowned land that is not being used

a cloud is hanging over negotiations between the 
government and 3000 national weather service employees who are 
striking for higher wages 
negotiations are blocked said a spokesman tuesday for one of 
four unions representing the striking meteorologists 
the unidentified spokesman quoted by the french news agency 
agencefrance presse said the unions have no meetings scheduled 
until thursday with government officials responsible for the weather 
service 
meteorologists however continued to provide critical aviation 
and marine forecasts during the walkout 
before the walkout began sunday night meteorologists graciously 
prepared a fiveday forecast that runs through thursday after that 
the weather is anybodys guess 
television and radio weather forecasters have had to be 
resourceful in the absence of the standard weather service bulletins 
and charts 
what we are doing is very rudimentary said laurent cabrol 
chief weatherman at the network antenne 2 like some skippers we 
are capturing a few weather charts transmitted by short and medium 
wave radio as facsimiles 
he added that he is getting some help from his colleagues in 
britain and west germany 
weather service meteorologists currently earn about 1000 a 
month at the beginning of their careers

soviet inspectors completed a tour tuesday of a 
former cruise missile production plant the first such survey on 
american soil under a treaty reducing mediumrange nuclear missiles 
the 10member soviet delegation arrived in san diego on monday 
and completed the inspection of air force plant 19 within 24 hours 
as prescribed by terms of the 1987 intermediate nuclear forces 
treaty 
soviet inspectors did not comment publicly on their findings 
which are part of a verification process to make sure the two 
superpowers are abiding by their agreement officials said 
they were to prepare a report a copy of which will be left with 
us officials and then fly on an air force transport to san 
francisco from there they were to board a soviet plane in the next 
day or so and return home said navy cmdr ken pease chief 
spokesman for the onsite inspection agency in washington dc 
the soviets are escorted 100 percent of the time they are in 
the united states pease said both parties have not commented 
we feel that these inspections are a privileged function of the 
treaty the inspections are just a small part of the inf treaty 
inspectors reports are sent back to the various governments 
both ours and theirs and analyzed along with other inputs from 
other sources 
the inspection at the plant operated by general dynamics convair 
division was to verify that components of the banned air force 
tomahawk missile system are no longer being produced there 
it went in accordance with the provisions of the treaty 
pease said the time lines have been meet the professionalism on 
both sides has been exemplary thats about all i can say 
the united states and the soviet union are each allowed 20 annual 
quota or shortnotice visits of certain defense plants through 
1992 when the number drops to 15 per year it will be reduced again 
in 1997 to 10 visits annually for the remainder of the 13year pact 
us inspectors have made six of their shortnotice visits to 
soviet defense since august while the soviets have conducted four 
previous shortnotice inspections of us installations in europe 
pease said 
the inspection in san diego was the first by the soviets in 
american territory however pease said 
tranportererectors used for the groundlaunched air force 
tomahawk missile which has a range of 1500 miles had been 
produced at leased areas of air force plant 19 in downtown san diego

us embassies abroad have hired hundred of 
foreign nationals for security posts and other jobs without 
background checks heightening the risk of espionage and terrorism 
a congressional report says 
the general accounting office looking at security for us posts 
in nine countries found that employees at eight of them had not 
been adequately investigated 
these shortcomings represent not only noncompliance with 
regulations but more importantly a gap in the us efforts to 
reduce the risk of espionage and terrorism at overseas posts the 
gao report said 
the gao found that of 328 local guards hired in egypt at least 
204 were not investigated by us officials it said there were no 
plans to investigate 48 guards who were hired for us posts by 
egyptian commercial contractors 
in argentina the ambassador hired a nanny and a chauffeur at his 
own expense without telling the american security officer according 
to the report later the nanny was found to have both local and us 
police records and the chauffeur was fired for helping to steal the 
ambassadors car it said 
the report did not name the ambassador 
it found that in algeria like egypt a neighbor of libya only 
52 of the 229 foreign nationals employed were investigated and none 
of the local guard force of 94 was among them 
in morocco of 821 nonamerican employees security files were 
missing on 112 and the security officer said 108 were probably never 
investigated 
in argentina 71 guards were investigated by a local contractor 
who hired them with no check by americans the us security 
officer in thailand had not investigated 183 local guards and the 
local contractor who supplied them was allowed to determine which 
ones to investigate 
a state department official said tuesday it is reviewing each 
post to see that investigations are in compliance with its rules 
but he added that the report does not seem to account for the 
various restrictions imposed by governments of the host countries 
in some countries no investigations are possible said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity

triplebypass heart surgery and a stroke left 
emile blouin disabled and with substantial medical bills when he 
got a letter a few months ago telling him he had won 5000 in a 
sweepstakes he thought at least some of his problems were over 
i was completely surprised i was so elated said blouin 77 
of phoenix 
he and his wife mary followed the instructions on the prize 
notification letter which asked them to send in money which would 
be donated to a charitable cause they sent a 25 check to the 
cancer fund of america and waited but their 5000 prize never came 
you feel as though you cant trust anybody anymore said mary 
blouin its not fair to the public 
the blouins are among thousands of consumers around the country 
who have complained to charity regulators that they were tricked 
into making contributions 
attorneys general in iowa missouri minnesota massachusetts and 
illinois have filed suit against the watson and hughey co a 
directmail fundraiser which represents a number of charities they 
allege that the alexandria va company engages in fraudulent fund 
raising with its sweepstakes prize announcement letters 
a foundation started by an awardwinning government scientist is 
among the groups that have employed watson and hughey for fund 
raising robert i glazer a senior scientist at the national cancer 
institute has been ordered by federal officials to return all 
donations collected through the solicitations his lawyer said 
tuesday 
attorney david h shapiro said glazers foundation the national 
leukemia research foundation has yet to receive any money from 
watson and hughey under a contract giving the directmail company 
the first 100000 raised 
tom mcclure a postal inspector said the us postal inspection 
service also has launched an investigation into watson and hughey 
people are really upset said frank driscoll of the national 
charities information service in new york city he said his office 
averages 36 calls a day from people concerned about the sweepstakes 
letters we never imagined we were going to get this avalanche 
many consumers have complained to charity regulators that they 
were sent letters telling them they had won 5000 or some other 
amount in a cash bonanza or irish sweepstakes to claim their prize 
they were asked to make a voluntary contribution which would go 
toward a charity 
after sending in donations and a form to claim their prize most 
received checks for only 10 cents 
they create the false impression that you win a valuable prize 
and the likelihood that you would win a lot of money is not very 
likely said wendy burt a minnesota state attorney spokeswoman a 
disclaimer on the back of the letter was insufficient she said 
adding it was in fine print and could easily be overlooked 
the iowa suit alleges that watson and hugheys solicitations are 
targeted toward susceptible populations including elderly people 
who may be unable to read deceptively worded disclosures buried in 
fine print 
the award notices are signed by washington attorney robert r 
stone who defended the fundraising tactics i dont believe 
theyre misleading if they read the facts but some people dont 
read everything stone said 
stone said he advises the company on state fundraising laws and 
his name appears on the letters 
watson and hughey co is headed by jerry c watson and byron c 
hughey both of virginia most of their clients are small charities 
with no largescale fundraising experience according to the 
chronicle of philanthropy a trade publication 
watson and hughey declined to be interviewed contacted by phone 
hughey said only im sorry i cant talk to you on the advice of 
my attorney 
besides the leukemia research foundation watson and hughey 
clients have included the cancer fund of america of knoxville 
tenn pacific west cancer fund of seattle wash walker cancer 
research institute of edgewood md social security protection 
agency of washington american heart disease prevention foundation 
inc of mountclair nj and project curecenter for alternative 
cancer research of washington 
some state attorneys general allege that little of the money 
raised through watson and hughey actually goes toward research 
normally less than 5 percent of the contributions are used for 
research or some kind of service for the people they say theyre 
going to help ms burt said 
the minnesota suit alleges that one of the charities project 
curecenter for alternative cancer research reported 36 million 
in revenue for 1987 but allocated nothing for research the 
majority of the 36 million went to management and fundraising 
expenses according to the suit 
james t reynolds president of the cancer fund of america 
denied that his organization tries to trick people with watson and 
hugheys fundraising letters 
they consumers are familiar with the rules reynolds said 
how in the world do you write everything so that everybody 
understands it 
reynolds said the cancer fund of america doesnt do research but 
helps cancer patients pay their bills 
we raise funds to provide assistance to medically indigent 
people he said were trying to help people 
also named in several suits is a forprofit organization called 
the social security protection bureau it sells consumers statements 
of their social security record social security cards and 
information on social security rule changes according to one of its 
fundraising letters 
a call to the organization was referred to the social security 
administration which is not affiliated with the company 
social security administration officials said many of the 
services sold by the company are available free of charge through 
the federal agency 
ssa spokesman frank battistelli said some people have walked into 
the government agency looking for money theyve won in a sweepstakes 
we have a lot of problems he said our best defense 
against it is an educated public

the inventive television series 
moonlighting is suspending broadcast until april because of a 
lack of scripts stemming from last years scriptwriters strike the 
executive producer said 
the rumor of our death is greatly exaggerated executive 
producer jay daniels said tuesday there has been absolutely no 
discussion the word canceled has never been broached 
abc executives said they are putting the hit comedy roseanne 
in half of the shows hourlong time slot on tuesday nights 
beginning at 9 pm est on feb 28 
another popular comedy the wonder years is moving to 830 
pm est tuesday the spot roseanne had occupied 
moonlighting has fallen in the ratings and was being beaten 
regularly by nbcs in the heat of the night glenn caron 
creator of moonlighting has left the show reportedly over 
creative differences with star cybill shepherd

strike daniels said each episode takes nine days to shoot when 
they are on schedule 
we just couldnt shoot episodes fast enough even staying on 
schedule as we are he said 
the tongueincheek detective show starring bruce willis and miss 
shepherd will return in the spring with all new episodes said 
brandon stoddard president of abc entertainment

weve tried to get back to entertaining shows and cases pretty 
much as david and maddie have been daniels said we do think 
its time for david and maddie to start dealing with their

sales of existing homes in 1988 hit their 
highest level in nine years as purchases shifted to the lowercost 
south and midwest and consumers opted to buy less costly dwellings 
rather than leave the market a real estate trade group reported 
despite the dampening effect of rising mortgage interest rates 
sales for 1988 totaled 399 million units up 26 percent from the 
previous year and the highest since 405 million sales were recorded 
in 1979 the national association of realtors said tuesday 
we underestimated the buying power strength of the baby boom 
generation said ira gribin president of the realtors group 
the market is being driven by people who are buying in spite of 
rising rates 
the biggest sales gains were posted in the least expensive 
regions of the country 
sales in the midwest were up 61 percent during the last quarter 
of 1988 from the previous three months and sales in the south rose 
54 percent the northeast meanwhile posted a 24 percent decline 
in sales while the west recorded a 14 percent increase 
the midwest was a bright star of the nations housing sector 
last quarter and we think its improvement will continue this 
year said john a tuccillo the realtors chief economist we 
have seen activity pick up in the midwest and south and subside in 
the highcost areas of the northeast 
prices of existing homes meanwhile rose 41 percent in 1988 to 
a national median of 89100 meaning half the homes cost more and 
half cost less for the fourth quarter of 1988 the median price was 
down to 87900 
the groups survey of 62 metropolitan areas found stark 
differences in median home prices around the nation ranging from a 
high of 231200 in californias orange county which includes 
anaheim and santa ana to a low of 53500 in oklahoma city 
two other california markets san francisco and los angeles 
ranked second and fourth in cost with median resale prices of 
228100 and 191200 honolulu with a median price of 225000 
was third 
the hot markets in california and hawaii also recorded the 
nations largest price increases between the fourth quarter of 1987 
and the same period last year 
prices in orange county were up 322 percent while they rose 
296 percent in san francisco 246 percent in los angeles and 186 
percent in san diego in hawaii prices were up 164 percent 
the increased sales activity in the midwest resulted in healthy 
price appreciation in several cities in that area including 
chicago where the median price last quarter rose to 101400 up 
108 percent from the fourth quarter of 1987 
the 87200 price in minneapolisst paul was up 82 percent and 
detroits median of 73400 was up 107 percent 
in the midwest we are seeing prices increase in areas that 
were largely bypassed by the housing expansion earlier in the 
1980s tuccillo said 
while prices in the northeast remained high costs in several 
cities there showed little escalation and even dropped in some cases 
prices in fifthranked boston moved up a modest 3 percent to 
182800 
in the new york metropolitan area which includes long island and 
northern new jersey prices were down 36 percent in the last 
quarter of 1988 but still ranked sixth in the nation at 178500 
seventhranked hartford with a median home price of 165000 
saw prices edge up just 07 percent 
in the northeast prices have basically run away from family 
income tuccillo said the market is slowing down there until 
incomes can catch up 
the least expensive places to live were led by oklahoma city 
where the median price was 53500 followed by des moines iowa at 
54800 louisville ky at 55600 toledo ohio at 56400 and 
lansing mich at 56700 
prices in oklahoma city fell 101 percent from the fourth quarter 
of 1987 the sharpest drop in the survey other oildependent areas 
also recorded falling prices including houston where the median 
dropped 96 percent to 56800 and san antonio texas where the 
median fell 81 percent to 62100

voters in a special primary tuesday put 
tuskegee mayor johnny ford who is seeking to become alabamas first 
black congressman this century into a runoff against secretary of 
state glen browder 
the winner of the democratic runoff on march 7 will face state 
sen john rice of opelika who won the republican nomination amid a 
light gop turnout the general election on april 4 is to fill a 
vacancy created by the dec 13 death of rep bill nichols a 
democrat first elected in 1966 
ford 46 ran strongly in his home base of predominantly black 
macon county and drew well enough elsewhere to make the runoff ahead 
of state sen jim preuitt of talladega and state rep charles adams 
of phenix city two generally conservative figures who appeared to 
have split each others vote 
we obviously received overwhelming support from the 
africanamerican community which is good said ford now that 
were in the runoff much of the quiet white support we got will 
come out openly now 
browder a 46yearold former jacksonville state university 
professor received 14701 votes or 25 percent followed by ford 
with 14434 votes or 24 percent with all precincts reporting 
unofficial returns trailing were preuitt with 10153 votes or 17 
percent and adams with 9831 votes or 17 percent state sens 
gerald dial and donald holmes and three other candidates shared the 
remainder 
we did not have a large media budget said browder but we 
had a lot of people working for us 
among republicans rice a 37yearold real estate developer 
avoided a runoff by winning 11145 votes or 62 percent followed by 
ray robbins with 4647 or 26 percent and two other candidates 
the 13county 3rd congressional district in east alabama which 
contains the university town of auburn and the industrial town of 
anniston as well as tuskegee is about 75 percent white 
prior to nichols death democrats held a 52 edge over 
republicans in the states congressional lineup the 3rd district is 
traditionally democratic but since alabama elected its first 
republican governor in a century in 1986 the gop has hopes of 
increasing its congressional numbers in alabama for the first time 
since five republicans won in 1964 
were the party of the conservatives the party with the 
majority of the feelings in the south said rice the key is 
that its a conservative district

federal safety officials blame the fatal 
headon collision of two conrail freight trains last year on work 
schedules that deny train crews normal sleep and called on the 
industry to improve conditions 
the national transportation safety board in a ruling tuesday 
asked the railroad industry to make an indepth assessment of 
what it can do to ensure that crews operate trains without falling 
asleep at the controls 
the railroad industry has long had unpredictable work schedules 
but the problem has worsened the board said it blamed the 
elimination of many regularly scheduled freight and passenger 
trains a cutback in yard operations agreements protecting employee 
seniority longer freight runs and relocations of work assignments 
under present conditions many train crew members may well work 
their entire careers without ever having a job with regularly 
assigned working hours and offduty periods the board said 
adding that this leads to sleep disorders 
the recommendations came in a report on a jan 14 1988 crash 
that killed four men two engineers and two brakemen operating 
conrail trains that plowed into each other outside thompsontown pa 
the board concluded that engineer melvin russell curry 40 and 
brakeman francis joseph madonna 46 were asleep when warning 
devices went off and said curry likely responded to the warning by 
hitting a foot pedal in his sleep deactivating an automatic braking 
system 
killed in the crash in addition to curry and madonnna were 
engineer russell paul henderson 30 and brakeman charles stephen 
desantis 56 who were operating a 61car train headed from chicago 
to harrisburg pa 
the two trains were moving at a combined speed of 71 miles per 
hour when they collided with one locomotive plowing over the top of 
the other one 
the board recommended several changes in the warning system 
safety controls locomotive design and the lines computerbased 
traffic control system but it laid the brunt of blame on erratic 
work schedules 
the probable cause of this accident was the sleepdeprived 
condition of the engineer and other crew members which resulted 
in their inability to stay awake and alert the board said 
the report said none of the men on the coal train which was 
headed from baltimore md to altoona pa had had more than two 
hours sleep in the previous 22 to 24 hours and they had not eaten 
in more than 13 hours the men had reported for work at 1130 pm 
and the crash was at 745 am the next day 
the report said curry had a different starting time almost every 
day and worked any day of the week it said he had only about 1 
hours of sleep and an hours nap in the 24 hours prior to the crash 
conrail spokeswoman pat linsky said the company could not comment 
in detail until officials had reviewed the board report 
but the railroad said curry and madonna had signed off their 
previous runs 375 hours earlier and the conductor 50 hours before 
boarding the baltimorealtoona train 
the company also said that the safety board had a statement from 
the engineers wife saying he liked his job and had no problems with 
the erratic hours

a manufacturers suggestion that american 
companies buy foreignmade us flags and replace made in taiwan 
labels with made in usa is causing a small uproar on capitol 
hill 
in all my years as a member of congress few issues have struck 
me as being as blatantly outrageous as the labelswitch proposal 
rep douglas applegate dohio wrote in a letter seeking a customs 
service investigation 
applegate was one of several members of congress who asked 
customs to look into the issue the inquiries were triggered by a 
letterwriting campaign by domestic flag manufacturers 
i feel we can compete with a us flag labeled made in taiwan 
but we cannot compete with a us flag labeled made in usa when in 
fact it wasnt wrote vane scott general manager of the colonial 
flag co in coshocton ohio 
scott provided applegate with a copy of a threepage 1987 
solicitation on the letterhead of the ming teh flag co ltd of 
taipei taiwan which suggested changing made in taiwan labels 
after the flag shipments had cleared customs 
we can realize why you need to lift off this label to 
prevent the resistance in us to import flags the solicitation 
said if possible we suggest you cut off this label after you 
receive the goods and spend very little cost to mark on the flags 
your own brand name and made in usa signs 
we can offer the labels too the solicitation added 
the copy which does not show to whom the solicitation was 
originally addressed was forwarded to customs by several 
congressional offices 
but a customs service spokesman said the labelswitch 
solicitation itself may not make a good case 
in the opinion of our folks here the letter is in effect a 
blueprint to a violation dennis shimkoski said tuesday its 
like a book on how to make a bomb 
if it were actually being done and people were in cahoots doing 
what the letter suggested that would be something else after a 
lengthy and complex investigation we might convict someone of a 
misdemeanor 
about a week ago the customs service asked the federal trade 
commission to look into the situation 
but robert easton special assistant for enforcement in the ftc 
bureau of consumer protection said theres no evidence yet that an 
american flag importer has violated countryoforigin labeling 
requirements 
we cant do anything easton said theres no violation in 
just sending a letter 
if there is evidence of labelswitching the ftc could go to 
court to stop the illegal practice he said and if any us company 
could show it lost business to a labelswitcher the lanham 
trademark act enables the company to file suit in federal court and 
recover both the amount of lost profit and the cost of bringing the 
suit 
without such a legal action theres no way of telling whether 
any us company has been hurt by fraudulent imports said whitney 
smith executive director of the flag research center in winchester 
mass 
the domestic flag industry is a small collection of privately 
owned companies that make few public disclosures he said 
theyre extremely secretive they consider almost everything a 
trade secret he said 
smith said he had not heard of labelswitching as a widespread 
problem but had heard complaints of textile companies in taiwan 
singapore and hong kong cutting into the domestic market with 
foreignmade stars and stripes 
in many cases he said the foreign companies send semifinished 
products to the united states where they are completed and perhaps 
packaged along with poles decorative eagles etc 
if more than half of the contents in a package come from the 
united states a company can legally remove a countryoforigin 
label such as made in taiwan said easton 
but they cant say made in usa unless its made in the usa 
he said

the environmental protection agency and its 
ohio counterpart have barred their employees from a federal uranium 
processing facility because of the risk of exposure to radioactivity 
tests indicated epa personnel were exposed to uranium oxide when 
they attended meetings at the feed materials production center in 
fernald ohio epa regional administrator valdas adamkus said in a 
letter obtained tuesday by congressional investigators 
adamkus ordered that no epa personnel go to the site until this 
health risk can be satisfactorily addressed 
the ohio epa followed suit tuesday but characterized the move as 
a precaution since its periodic checks have not revealed a similar 
problem 
the plants operator said it believes the facility is safe and 
questioned the accuracy of urine tests given to epa employees it 
said it will try to demonstrate by the end of the week that its own 
routine testing program is accurate 
we dont know what lab epa is using but we have the utmost 
confidence in our program said william h kelley spokesman for 
westinghouse materials of ohio the contractor operating the plant 
for the us department of energy 
a spokeswoman for ohio gov richard celeste said the actions 
reinforce the governors desire to get an expert panel to look 
into the situation a panel of the caliber of the one that looked 
into the space shuttle challenger accident 
the fernald plant has been the subject of intense scrutiny by 
congress and the press because of contamination problems and 
allegations that its radioactive and chemical discharges may have 
harmed people who live and work nearby 
a longrange blueprint approved by president reagan shortly 
before he left office targeted the deteriorating uranium foundry as 
the first that should be closed as the government modernizes its 
network of nuclear bomb plants 
adamkus discussed his order tuesday at a meeting in chicago with 
joseph la grone the energy departments oak ridge operations 
manager epa spokeswoman ann rowan said 
the officials agreed to meet again on the subject but no date was 
set and what we said in the letter still holds she said 
ohio epa director richard shank decided to make a similar order 
covering state epa employees after meeting with the federal 
officials in chicago spokesman allan franks said 
as a precautionary measure we have ordered our people who do 
routine work to stay away from the site until a regular monitoring 
system is set up he said adding that a state epa safety health 
officer would set up the monitoring system as soon as possible 
la grone on monday offered to have the energy department finance 
new urine tests to determine whether there is truly a potential 
personnel exposure problem or in fact a laboratory problem 
adamkus letter dated feb 9 and la grones letter of response 
were obtained tuesday by the investigative staff of rep tom luken 
dohio 
luken said he was upset that the epa didnt notify fernald 
workers about the uranium oxide exposure threat 
the public is totally unprotected when the monitor bars its own 
inspectors from the premises he said if its unsafe for epa 
shouldnt it be off limits to everyone it is scary 
kelley said workers at the plant in southwest ohio about 18 
miles from cincinnati were notified tuesday of the epa actions 
the plant which processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons or 
as fuel for reactors is the subject of a lawsuit on behalf of 
14000 people who live or work nearby and believe their health has 
been threatened by radioactive discharges into the air and water 
cincinnati attorney stanley chesley an attorney in the 300 
million classaction lawsuit called the latest development an 
example of the ongoing trauma that continues to plague this plant 
this is why we are so concerned about compensation to the 
victims he said every day there is another revelation

as the helicopter marine one 
bound from pease air force base in portsmouth nh reached the 
atlantic ocean at twilight and whirred north along the rocky maine 
coast its primary passenger suddenly grew animated 
president bush was headed home even though he and his wife 
barbara have lived in 31 homes in 17 cities the comfortable 
threestory gray shingle and stone house on the ocean is the only 
one they own 
you could see the sparkle in his eyes as he was getting closer 
to home he started pointing out houses of friends and neighbors as 
we got closer he loves being back in kennebunkport said press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater was aboard the presidential chopper with bush last 
weekend as the chief executive made his first visit back as 
president to his family retreat a stop on the way back to 
washington from a visit to ottawa canada 
but the seacoast village permanent population 1200 had 
changed even since the bushes visited there last thanksgiving 
no longer can motorists drive unimpeded along ocean avenue which 
winds along the coast right past the bush compound on a rockbound 
promontory known as walkers point the road passes so close 
that you can easily pick out individuals on the lawn of the house 
at night when the president is present the road a main 
thoroughfare is closed now where it passes the bush home except 
to authorized personnel or to the three other families who live 
in the secured stretch they must carry large cards identifying 
themselves as residents 
security officers standing by bright floodlights at two 
checkpoints divert other traffic onto a backroad detour 
during daylight hours drivers are stopped and told they can 
proceed but only if they dont stop 
a new secret service command post sits on the grounds and a 
coast guard cutter maintains a constant vigil offshore 
bush memorabilia now dominates windows in the stores bordering 
dock square and along route 9 on either side of the drawbridge that 
crosses the kennebunk river in the center of this summer vacation 
spot 
the items range from kennebushport sweatshirts to towels 
showing a bush character lounging in a beach chair to cookbooks 
featuring recipes from barbara bush who insists she doesnt cook 
to postcards depicting the summer home of the president 
the postcards were wrong it was deep february snow was on the 
ground and even though only three rooms of the house are heated in 
the winter the bushes were clearly intent on not limiting their 
visits to the warm months 
nor were they about to spend all their time at home the bushes 
last weekend walked into town to buy household items at a pharmacy 
visiting a lobster market on the way and causing something of a stir 
all along the 15mile route 
they also attended services at the tiny tworoom first 
congregational church of kennebunkport on sunday where the first 
lady responded in a clear voice to a request by the rev robert 
howes for any news of interest to the congregation 
we had a new baby barbara bush said referring to their 11th 
grandchild ashley bush who was born to neil and sharon bush of 
denver earlier this month 
bush has told townspeople that he intends to keep coming back to 
the house on the coast where he has been coming for every one of 
his 64 summers except once during world war ii 
he also promised to drive his speedboat slowly when in the 
channel in the kennebunk river to permit lobstermen to continue to 
work their traps in the cove next to his house and to try not to 
hold up traffic 
barbara and i want to be good neighbors he told a town rally 
when he visited last thanksgiving 
the bush compound is set on more than six acres of seashore land 
that was purchased originally by the maternal grandfather after whom 
bush was named george herbert walker sr a prominent stockbroker 
the bushes bought the house in 1981 from his mother dorothy 
walker bush 
during their marriage the bushes have owned two houses in 
midland texas three in houston one in washington and two in 
kennebunkport 
all have been sold except for the one on the maine coast which 
bush has valued at about 1 million the overall compound is worth 
35 million but bushs mother still owns the land 
in his 1987 biography looking forward bush said that while 
he was growing up maine in the summer was the best of all 
possible adventures 
as president it still seems to be and not just in the summer

an agriculture department study shows that the 
massive conservation reserve program for taking fragile cropland 
from production could save billions of dollars by helping clean up 
the nations rural water supply 
the crp was included in the 1985 farm law as a vehicle for taking 
40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible land from crop 
production and planting it in protective grass and trees for 10 
years 
more than 28 million acres have been enrolled and usda officials 
say further signups will bring the 1990 target within reach 
overall the report said tuesday the crp may generate an 
estimated 35 billion to 4 billion in water quality benefits 
through reduced water treatment costs lower sediment removal costs 
less damage to equipment that uses water and increased recreational 
fishing 
farming activities generate materials than can be carried into 
waterways by runoff these farmgenerated pollutants include 
nutrients from chemical fertilizers and animal manure primarily 
nitrogen and phosphorous pesticides sediment and dissolved 
minerals and salts the report said 
sediment washing off cropland and into waterways can fill 
reservoirs block navigation channels interfere with conveyance 
systems harm aquatic plant life and degrade recreational 
resources the report said 
potential for the crp to bring about a major reduction in the 
discharge of agricultural pollutants into waterways is large 
because of the large acreage involved and because only highly 
erodible land is eligible to be enrolled the report said 
the study by the departments economic research service said 
the estimate of 35 billion to 4 billion in water benefits was 
based on an assumption that the full 45 million acres would be 
signed into the program 
it said the benefit estimates are incomplete because neither the 
benefits associated with swimming and commercial fishing nor those 
from reduced pesticide use were taken into account

farmers are going to use more fertilizer this 
year and theyll be paying higher prices for it says the 
agriculture department 
overall fertilizer use by us farmers is expected to rise 9 
percent this year because of larger crop plantings and higher crop 
prices the departments economic research service said tuesday in a 
report by spring planting prices are expected to average about 7 
percent more than a year ago 
world use of commercial fertilizers also is climbing a trend 
that is expected to continue at least for several more years 
by the early 1990s world growth in nitrogen demand could 
exceed supply leading to higher prices the report said the 
developed countries will likely have excess phosphate supplies 
while the soviet union asia and eastern europe will be deficit 
areas 
the greatest surplus of potash another fertilizer ingredient is 
expected to be in north america while western europe asia afria 
and latin america are projected to be in short supply the report 
said 
some other farm production items are likely to be more costly 
this spring including pesticides up 2 percent to 5 percent crop 
seeds 10 percent to 15 percent and farm energy costs 
despite the drought 1988 farm machinery expenditures rose an 
estimated 5 percent to 10 percent over 1987 the report said a 
similar increase is likely in 1989 when expenditures could reach 
64 billion to 71 billion 
last years sales of most types of machinery remained stable or 
increased except for a 16 percent drop in combine sales the report 
said barring poor weather sales of all major kinds of machinery 
are expected to increase in 1989

the agriculture department plans to lower honey 
supports for the 1989 crop by nearly 5 percent from last year part 
of a gradual decline specified by 1985 farm law 
milton hertz executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp said tuesday that the basic honey support 
would be lowered to 5636 cents per pound from 591 cents in 1988 
adjustments of the basic support can be made according to honeys 
flower source color class grade location and other market 
differentials 
details of the 1989 honey program were officially published feb 
13 in the governments rulemaking document the federal register 
comments on the proposal can be sent by march 15 to director 
commodity analysis division usdaascs po box 2415 washington 
dc 20013 
hertz also asked for comments on continuing the programs 
marketing loan provision which allows producers to repay honey 
price support loans at less than the original loan rate 
in effect this lets the producer to sell honey to the 
government and then buy it back for less 
currently for example producers can buy back 1988crop honey at 
rates of 34 to 40 cents per pound depending on quality the ccc 
loans originally were for 48 to 62 cents per pound

europeans generally seem puzzled by the probes into 
the personal lives of people nominated for high us government 
posts such as the investigation now of john tower the designee for 
secretary of defense 
some say they think the deep probing that goes on inside and 
outside senate confirmation hearings in washington may be harmful in 
the long run 
such proceedings are virtually unknown in western europe where 
cabinet ministers by and large are chosen from the ranks of loyal 
party troopers who over the years have worked their way to the top 
any serious scrutiny nearly always comes after the fact 
the difference is one of system of government but it is also 
cultural in most european countries a politicians private life is 
sacrosanct except for the most extreme cases personal foibles are 
considered irrelevant to professional abilities 
towers nomination is on hold while the fbi investigates 
allegations about his drinking womanizing and financial ties with 
military contractors 
the confirmation process in the united states is not very well 
understood in europe said dominique moisi of the french 
insititute for international relations in france when the 
president of the republic asks his premier to choose a defense 
minister the parliament has no say in the matter 
the president of france selects his premier from the majority 
party in the national assembly the premier proposes a cabinet to 
the president who has final say and makes the official 
appointments ministers are nearly all known political faces with 
the occasional specialist thrown in 
the french government as a whole can be voted out of office by 
parliament but there is no individual confirmation process 
that is generally the case throughout western europe 
whats worrying about the entire american system is that the 
way the press now with the cooperation of congress is going with 
these inquiries it is going to be very hard to find people of real 
ability to go into public life said anthony barnes a lecturer in 
government at the london school of economics 
in britain the prime minister chooses the cabinet whose members 
must also be legislators and in practice all are members of the 
governing party there are no hearings though mi5 the british 
secret service is widely believed to run checks on most members of 
parliament 
the aggression on the private lives of individuals is pushed 
too far in the united states said moisi the sexuality of our 
politicians except in the most extreme cases is never discussed in 
public the number of politicians with mistresses is numerous but 
never discussed there is a sort of selfcensorship 
indeed the peccadillos of some extremely highranking french 
political figures are widely known but rarely mentioned publicly 
at the time of the great brouhaha over gary harts relationship 
with donna rice the big joke in paris was that the french were not 
at all shocked by the fact that hart a democratic presidential 
hopeful spent the night with a woman what disturbed them was he 
said afterward that nothing happened 
typically american romes la repubblica newspaper said of 
the tower hearings so full of puritanical echoes but in 
reality dense with precise political intentions tower is the 
sacrificial victim 
wrote the washington correspondent of the paris le monde even 
if mr tower finally is confirmed he will arrive at the pentagon in 
a pitiful state 
italys cabinet ministers ostensibly are named by the premier 
who is named by the president but in reality the parties negotiate 
cabinet spots during coalitionbuilding 
west germanys ministers are selected by the chancellor and 
approved by the president and the president of the parliament but 
there are no hearings and no vote by parliament 
a west german government spokesman ulrich strempel said while 
background and security checks are routinely made the selection 
process is nothing like the unique system practiced in the united 
states but that doesnt mean some embarrassing details cant come 
to light later that could spell a swift end to a ministerial 
career 
britains barnes said to assess presidential choice for 
integrity seems quite reasonable but the pursuit of every kind of 
tittle tattle about a mans sex life or the fact that hes been seen 
with a drink in his hand seems to be carrying the process too far 
no system is immune to corruption but im not sure that a 
corrupt appointee is more or less likely to be exposed in the united 
states than here

the treasury department has released an 18page 
summary of savings and loan legislation the administration intends 
to submit to congress next week here is a summary of new details in 
the document which was released tuesday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the federal deposit insurance corp with responsibility for both 
bank and sampl deposits would get broad new power to countermand 
regulatory decisions by the primary regulator of sampls the federal 
home loan bank board which would become part of the treasury 
department 
regulators would restrict interest rates offered by insolvent 
institutions limit the institutions growth and their ability to 
obtain highcost deposits from money brokers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the fdic would get the power to put an institution into 
receivership if its capital falls below what the fdic determines is 
a safe level even if it is still solvent 
currently an institution cant be closed until all of its 
capital is exhausted advocates of early closure say it would 
save money for government insurance funds 
sampl owners by june 1991 are being required to come up with money 
to raise capital levels from the required 3 percent to the 6 percent 
level now in force for commercial banks in the meantime regulators 
would be required to restrict the growth of any institution that 
doesnt meet the capital requirements 
as a way of bringing new capital into the industry bank holding 
companies would be allowed to buy healthy sampls after two years 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the bush plan calls for raising bank insurance premiums from 83 
cents per 100 to 15 cents and sampl premiums from 208 cents to 23 
cents but in extraordinary circumstances insurance fund 
administrators could increase the premium by 50 percent a year up to 
a maximum of 75 cents currently congress must approve any increase 
the insurance fund would also be allowed to raise the insurance 
premiums for individual institutions as their capital fell closer to 
failure levels 
the treasury department would have 18 months to finish a study on 
reducing the scope of deposit insurance 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
accounting rule changes would have the effect of requiring the 
nations 14000 credit unions to come up with about 15 billion 
over eight years to strengthen the national credit union share 
insurance fund the rules would also make it costly for a federally 
insured credit union to pull out and enter a private insurance plan 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
officials of the restructured regulatory system would be directed 
to review last years rescue of 205 sampls with the goal of reducing 
the governments costs the government cant undo the deals but it 
could exercise contract rights reducing the ultimate cost of 
assistance to the new owners of rescued sampls 
in the future regulators would have to take tax losses to the 
government into consideration before deciding on the best rescue 
method regulators ability to use promissory notes and loss 
guarantees would be restricted 
the federal asset disposition association a muchcriticized 
quasigovernment agency created to manage and sell off assets from 
failed sampls would be abolished within six months 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
currently sampls are prohibited from converting into banks until 
august the bush plan would extend that for five years after that 
sampls could convert by paying an exit fee to the sampl insurance fund 
and an entrance fee to the bank fund large healthy sampls looking to 
become banks much sooner than five years likely will fight this 
provision 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
banks and sampls would have to bail out sister institutions owned 
by the same holding company 
regulators would be allowed to offer whistleblowers a reward for 
reporting bank fraud and give regulators the power to require that 
fired informants be reinstated and given back pay 
the administration leaves open the question of whether banks and

a top adviser to president bush says the 
administration will fight any effort to scuttle proposals designed 
to sever the close relationship between federal regulators and the 
savings and loan industry 
bushs proposal to restructure the sampl regulatory system is 
inseparable from any infusion of taxpayer money richard c breeden 
assistant to the president said in an interview at the white house 
on tuesday 
last week bush proposed spending 126 billion over the next 
decade to close or sell failed sampls 40 billion of it a direct 
charge against the taxpayers and federal budget 
he also would wrap the independent federal home loan bank board 
which regulates the nations 3000 sampls into the treasury 
department and merge the staff of the sampl deposit insurance fund 
into the larger federal deposit insurance corp which guarantees 
commercial bank accounts 
sampl industry officials have denounced the restructuring plan as a 
power grab by the treasury department and have vowed to fight it 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the house banking 
subcommittee with jurisdiction over sampls has promised to help them 
breeden said the bank board as an independent agency has a 
long history of a close relationship with the industry it 
regulates 
the president wants to be able to say to the american public 
that we are ensuring that this crisis will not happen again and he 
cant make that promise if the agency that has responsibility for 
oversight isnt accountable to him breeden said 
at 40 billion were talking about the equivalent of something 
on the order of 100 billion school lunches i find it 
inconceivable to suggest that we would drop a 40 billion check in 
the mail and just say well we hope you use it wisely and we hope 
things come out better next time he said 
breeden said the administration would spare no effort to help 
congress meet bushs challenge to pass the sampl program in 45 days 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the senate 
banking committee and sen jake garn of utah the committees 
senior republican have already agreed to introduce the 
administration program 
an inchthick draft of the bill was sitting on breedens desk 
tuesday and he said it likely would be submitted to congress next 
week he described the tone of discussion on the issue between the 
administration and legislators as excellent 
i hope things will go smoothly but i dont want to be 
unrealistic he said we are proposing some profound longrun 
changes in the regulatory system 
breeden a 39yearold lawyer came to the administration from 
the washington office of the wellconnected texas law firm of baker 
amp botts previously he served as staff director of a task force on 
financial regulation chaired by bush as vice president 
breeden said the presidents plan also would make changes to 
insulate sampl examiners from the institutions they regulate 
examiners work for the regional federal home loan banks which 
lend money to individual sampls and are owned by the industry breeden 
said the administration would expand the boards of directors of the 
12 regional banks to include more members representing the general 
public bush would also have examiners report directly to top 
regulatory officials in washington rather than to the regional bank 
presidents he said

the reagan administration thwarted by congress 
in its efforts to provide money to the nicaraguan contras sought 
aid for the rebels from third countries starting in 1984 according 
to testimony from a 1987 congressional investigation into the 
irancontra affair 
between june 1984 and the beginning of 1986 the president the 
national security adviser and the national security council staff 
secretly raised 34 million for the contras from other countries 
said a congressional report based on hearings into how officials 
sold weapons to iran and then diverted the proceeds to the contras 
the issue of thirdcountry support for the contras surfaced this 
week at the trial of oliver l north the former national security 
council aide and chief architect of the irancontra plan 
norths attorneys claim that a plan to protect state secrets 
during the trial will prevent them from showing that former 
president reagan and other top administration officials offered 
inducements to foreign governments in soliciting military aid to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
the congressional report said saudi arabia gave the lions share 
of the money 32 million to the contras after congress balked at 
appropriating military aid to the rebels in late 1984 taiwan gave 
2 million in that period 
the report detailed how us officials from the nsc the cia and 
eventually the state department sought financial assistance to keep 
alive the contras war against nicaraguas marxist regime some 
solicitations to third countries were unsuccessful 
the saudis were the first to contribute to the contras in june 
1984 after the rebels had exhausted the last portion of us 
assistance 
before that us officials had been rebuffed in an approach to 
israel and declined an offer by south africa to donate money said 
the report which does not identify the countries by name officials 
later confirmed the names 
robert mcfarlane the former national security adviser testified 
that the saudi ambassador agreed initially to contribute 1 million 
a month through the end of the year 
in february 1985 the saudis pledged another 24 million meaning 
the oilrich kingdom handed over a total of 32 million to the 
contras between june 1984 and march 1985 
after the saudis first offer mcfarlane said he told reagan and 
thenvice president bush about contribution and was informed of 
reagans satisfaction and pleasure that this had occurred 
but other top white house officials had second thoughts about 
accepting contributions for the contras the report said 
secretary of state james baker iii then the white house chief of 
staff reportedly said it would be an impeachable offense for 
the united states to act as a conduit for thirdcountry funding for 
the contras according to the testimony of bakers predecessor 
george shultz baker later said he did not recall using that 
language but was concerned about legalities 
because of his objections to third country solicitations shultz 
was not told of the contributions from saudi arabia the report said 
but north arranged for the transfer of money to contra leader 
adolfo calero on june 25 1984 the report said 
later officials at the cia and the justice department agreed 
there would be no legal problem with third countries giving money to 
the contras so long as the united states did not appropriate the 
money 
former attorney general william french smith also said the donors 
could not expect washington to repay that commitment in the 
future stanley sporkin a former cia general counsel said

president bush is still trying to fill scores 
of top government posts and has asked his legal counsel to look into 
ways to speed up background checks on people he wants to appoint a 
white house source said 
bush is frustrated by a drawnout process that is keeping him 
from putting people in place and moving his agenda forward said the 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the president at a tuesday meeting of his top assistants 
expressed impatience and told white house counsel c boyden gray to 
see what he could do about speeding up the process the source said 
that source and another official said much of the problem 
involves the lengthy fbi backgroundchecking process and the 
requirement that a person who worked for one government agency in 
the past must start anew in the process when picked for a different 
agency 
but white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush is 
moving slowly in making nominations partly because of attempts to 
recruit women and minorities people from outside government who are 
undergoing checks for the first time 
were in no particular hurry fitzwater told reporters at the 
daily white house briefing 
he said some 130 appointments were being checked by the fbi and 
the administration was particularly trying to find women and 
minorities for many of these positions 
some of the background checks are taking longer than has been 
the case in the past he said 
in the meantime many of these key jobs are being held by reagan 
administration holdovers 
in the first weeks of the reagan administration in 1981 dozens 
of such key nominations had been confirmed by the senate there so 
far has been no confirmation of anyone but some cabinet nominees 
the washington post reported tuesday that commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher complained to white house staff chief john sununu 
about the selection process 
fitzwater said he believed that the report overstated mosbachers 
frustration with the situation 
on another matter fitzwater said that in selecting people for 
ambassadorial posts bush wants to find the bestqualified 
candidates not necessarily use the posts to reward old friends and 
supporters 
few ambassadorial appointments have been announced the new york 
times reported tuesday however that bush has honored tradition by 
rewarding major campaign contributors with plum assignments 
the newspaper mentioned the appointment of jp curley jr of new 
york a fundraiser and family friend to become ambassador to 
france peter secchia the republican national committeeman from 
michigan ambassador to italy investor and developer joseph zappala 
of tampa fla ambassador to spain florida developer melvin f 
sembler ambassador to australia and fredrick bush deputy finance 
chairman of the campaign and no relation to the president 
ambassador to luxembourg 
fitzwater said bush wants qualified men and women of recognized 
leadership and ability and we think all our ambassador appointments 
will be of the highest quality

the government could save more money in the 
long run if it paid for the early detection and treatment of a 
blinding disease in diabetics says a study that is one of a growing 
number to stress the economics of health care 
the cost of saving a year of sight is substantially less 
approximately one seventh the cost of a year of disability paid by 
the federal government to the blind dr jonathan c javitt an 
ophthalmologist at the wilmer eye institute at johns hopkins 
university and principal author of the eye disease study said in an 
interview tuesday 
in the face of soaring health care costs more researchers are 
considering the financial implications of expensive medical 
treatments and the savings that can be had through preventive 
measures 
this growing new class of research based on financial as well as 
clinical considerations of treatment comes from the recognition 
that just outcomes of care without sensitivity to cost is not 
enough said jonathan weiner associate professor of health policy 
at johns hopkins 
the studies come in response to increasing pressures from the 
federal government and other healthcare payers in the face of 
escalating health care costs and the consequences for an estimated 
35 million americans who dont qualify for government health 
assistance and cant afford private insurance 
more and more clinical journals are talking about cost 
effectiveness weiner said and doctors are increasingly looking 
at dollars along with their doses 
the eye disease that was the subject of the study diabetic 
retinopathy is the leading cause of new cases of blindness among 
workingage americans the study said more than 70 percent of 
diabetics will develop the disease in their lifetime 
early detection and treatment of the eye disease though can 
reduce the likelihood of severe vision loss by 60 percent said the 
study published in the february issue of ophthalmology the journal 
of the american academy of ophthalmology 
as many as 880000 of the 11 million americans who have diabetes 
have no medical insurance and many more may be underinsured the 
study said these people are less likely than insured diabetics to 
seek medical care for screening and treatment of the eye disease 
early screening and treatment could save an average three years 
of sight for each diabetic the study said adding up the costs of 
screening and treatment for all diabetic patients this amounts to 
an average savings of 966 for each year of sight saved per person 
the study said 
in contrast the average annual cost of social security 
disability payments made to each american worker disabled by 
diabetesrelated vision loss is 6900 the study said in addition 
anyone who remains eligible for social security disability insurance 
for two years automatically becomes eligible for medicare benefits 
javitt and his colleagues at johns hopkins dana center for 
preventive ophthalmology developed a computer model that analyzed 
progression of the disease vision loss in afflicted patients 
treatment outcome and mortality 
these diseaserelated events were applied statistically to 31000 
cases the estimated number of new cases of juvenileonset 
insulindependent diabetes each year in the united states people 
with this kind of diabetes generally get the disease before age 30 
diabetes deteriorates small blood vessels in the body including 
those in the retina at the back of the eye in the early stages of 
the eye disease weakened blood vessels may leak causing the retina 
to swell and resulting in blurred vision 
in more advanced stages of the disease the retina becomes so 
starved of oxygencarrying blood new blood vessels begin to grow 
but they tend to rupture and bleed this results in more scarring 
and blurred vision and can cause the retina to detach from the back 
of the eye which often leads to severe vision loss or blindness 
the most common treatment for the eye disease is laser therapy 
which seals the blood vessels and halts the diseases progress 
the computer model predicted that 54 percent of the 31000 people 
studied would have severe vision loss if not screened or treated for 
the eye disease compared with 28 percent who received early 
treatment

the social security trust fund should be 
removed from calculations of the federal deficit because it makes 
the budget picture too optimistic and undermines the retirement 
program a house panel says 
the social security trust funds represent an opportunity for 
current workers to save for their retirement the report said 
but they cannot have this effect if they are used simply to 
offset current deficits in other federal accounts 
the task force appointed by house democrats byron dorgan of 
north dakota and mary rose oakar of ohio included a bipartisan 
group of economists the panels view echoes a growing perception on 
capitol hill that using social security taxes to hide shortfalls in 
the governments operating budget is flawed and allows a drain on 
the economy 
the 1983 revisions to the social security law increased 
retirement taxes on workers to build up a surplus that would protect 
the baby boom generation when it retires early in the next century 
according to recent calculations by the congressional budget office 
the social security trust fund surplus reduces the deficit by 56 
billion this year and will soon top 100 billion a year 
but because that money is covering the shortfall in the rest of 
the budget the governmentenforced savings is essentially 
cancelled the task force said

the united states and the soviet union have 
agreed to work more closely in efforts to curb illegal salmon 
fishing in international waters of the pacific ocean the state 
department says 
department officials said tuesday that negotiators from the two 
countries had decided that illegal salmon fishing on the high seas 
by other nations represented an irrational and wasteful harvesting 
method and that all efforts should be taken to prevent the 
unauthorized possession harvest transport and sale of salmon in 
the north pacific 
american fishing groups have contended that illegal catches by 
foreign trawlers sometimes under the guise of fishing for squid 
have already resulted in depleted salmon runs in the pacific 
northwest and alaska 
soviet and us negotiators meeting last week in washington 
signed a memorandum of understanding in which the two countries 
agreed to increase their bilateral cooperation in the field of 
enforcing salmon conservation measures

the disabled american veterans say military and 
veterans hospitals can save money and improve care by working 
together more often 
the three military hospital systems and the veterans 
administration system are in deep trouble because of years of 
financial starvation in the face of growing patient demands said 
billy e kirby national commander of the group 
lack of money has brought about losses of staff and beds and a 
rationing of care he said tuesday at a joint hearing of the house 
and senate veterans affairs committees 
in 1982 congress permitted local installations to agree with 
their neighbors in another hospital system to share facilities for 
example to send over patients needing a cat scan rather than buy a 
second scanner there are now 1800 agreements involving 300 
installations 
rather than settling for locally initiated ad hoc agreements 
the more ambitious of which often encounter bureaucratic resistance 
we propose the creation of a new nationwide veterans 
administrationdepartment of defense health care alliance kirby 
said

highway trucks will spread a noncorrosive 
nonpolluting deicer made of corn rather than salt if a scientist 
at a federal lab succeeds in reducing the cost of the product 
the goal is to eliminate use of salt which penetrates concrete 
and corrodes metal and steel doing damage to highways bridges and 
the cars that travel them 
there are several advantages of the cornbased deicer said 
william bryan a chemical engineer at the us department of 
agricultures research laboratory here 
its not only noncorrosive to automobile bodies roads and 
bridges its actually acts as an inhibitor plus its 
nonpolluting and it would create a new market for corn products 
bryan said tuesday 
the cornbased deicer a compound called calcium magnesium 
acetate or cma already is produced commercially but only on a small 
scale 
state highway departments simply cant afford to make a large 
investment in it because it costs so much more than salt 600 per 
ton versus 25 
but some state officials such as new yorks lawrence hudson say 
eliminating salt can save money in the long run 
for every ton of salt we buy for 25 and put on the road 
society ends up paying a great deal more about 1000 per ton 
said hudson of the new york state energy research and development 
authority 
the problem is that cma is very expensive we must find a way 
to bring down the cost of cma so that state highway departments can 
afford it without needing a tax increase 
new york state uses about 1 million tons of salt each winter or 
about 11 percent of the national total said hudson who estimates 
his states damage from salt to roads bridges automobiles and 
environment at 900 million to 2 billion a year 
the us environmental protection agency estimates the national 
damage at 5 billion 
bryan plans to dramatically reduce the cost of the corn deicer 
by using a new production process 
its unknown how much we can reduce the cost but i certainly 
think we can cut it in half he said but were looking at a 
tougher fermentation process and it will be difficult to handle on a 
large scale thats the problem 
bryan said the key to his project is finding a more efficient way 
to convert sugar to acetic acid a primary component of the corn 
deicer his plan involves a new fermentation process that requires 
temperatures of 140 degrees in large airfree vats 
the environmental advantages are as important as the economics of 
replacing salt bryan said suggesting the corn deicer would help 
alleviate acid rain and reduce groundwater pollution and vegetation 
loss due to salt runoff 
as an example he said sodium levels in some massachusetts water 
supplies are too high for people on lowsodium diets that problem 
prompted massachusetts to field test cma on its highways 
this is the third year weve tried cma and except for the 
cost were pleased with its effectiveness and optimistic about 
decreasing sodium levels in our water supplies said mark cain an 
engineer with the massachusetts department of public works

a 2yearold girl has won the right to be named 
princess after a battle royal between her parents and officials from 
buckingham palace and the scottish bureaucracy 
princess dulcima rosetta manwaringspencer claims no royal 
connections but her parents liked the name and never imagined theyd 
run into problems with the royal family and the government 
audrey and hugh manwaringspencer finally emerged triumphant last 
week when scotlands registrar general of births deaths and 
marriages backed down and decided there was no specific authority 
banning the use of names like princess 
theyre very pleased that its finally been resolved and they 
can finally call their little girl princess said martin johnson 
a family spokesman they always assumed common sense would 
prevail 
princess and her parents remained unavailable for comment the 
nonpaying media they were on their farm on the isle of skye off 
scotlands west coast which is better known for its rugged beauty 
than its courtly graces 
shortly after the girl was born july 5 1986 the registry clerk 
on the isle of skye duly recorded princess dulcima rosetta on her 
birth certificate and she was baptized with those names 
we simply liked the name mrs manwaringspencer told the 
associated press last year when the problem surfaced every family 
argues over what to call their children we liked princess 
the birth certificate was sent to the registrar general in 
edinburgh which wrote back five months later saying the name was 
unacceptable and demanded that manwaringspencers hand over their 
copy of the certificate 
based upon an order in council of 1910 the name princess is 
not a recognized forename in this country because it is part of the 
crowns royal prerogative and cannot be assumed or entered in any 
register or official document without the consent of the 
sovereign the letter said 
the manwaringsmiths tenant farmers who have four other 
children took up the challenge and wrote to queen elizabeth ii 
in december 1987 royal aide robert fellowes wrote back you 
may rest assured that you have caused no offense to the queen and 
you may continue to use the word as your daughters christian name 
but three weeks later fellowes wrote again to inform the 
manwaringspencers the 1965 scottish birth registration law ruled 
out the name princess 
last week after an investigation by the registrar general the 
manwaringspencers were informed that the name princess could remain 
on the registry of births said a scottish office spokesman 
requesting anonymity 
one of the main conclusions of the investigation was the 
registrar general had no specific authority as such for preventing 
the use of the name princess on a birth register the spokesman 
said tuesday 
its not a change in rules he said its merely a change 
in practice and attitude as interpreted by the registrar generals 
office in scotland 
a buckingham palace spokeswoman also requesting anonymity said 
theres been no objection from here its been a question of 
abiding by the law

an elderly priest in the underground roman 
catholic church who was alleged to have received money from the 
vatican has been released from jail after 2 months a chinese 
official said 
the rev liu shuhe 69 who also uses the name paul was arrested 
in october after allegedly meeting with an unidentified italian 
the italian embassy said today it did not know of any italian 
having been in contact with liu and was not familiar with the case 
police confiscated 12000 he was carrying and alleged that it 
was sent from the vatican an official of lius home county said 
tuesday 
contacts with the vatican with whom china has no relations are 
illegal 
shen rongbin of the civil affairs committee in yi county about 
60 miles south of the capital said liu was jailed there and 
released jan 16 
shen said liu maintained that the money was mailed to him by a 
former classmate now in the philippines but shen said liu was known 
to be in contact with the vatican through foreign travelers to china 
and the mail 
the vatican a sovereign state within italy still recognizes the 
nationalist chinese on taiwan as the rightful rulers of all china 
the communists who took power in 1949 set up their own catholic 
patriotic association to manage catholic church affairs and ordered 
all chinese catholics to renounce allegiance to the vatican 
liu was among hundreds of priests nuns and laymen who were 
arrested in the 1950s and released only in the 1970s because of 
their refusal to renounce the vatican 
an unknown number of catholics still loyal to the vatican 
continue to worship in the underground church chinas official 
catholic church claims more than 3 million members 
an undetermined number of protestants also hold illegal services 
at house churches because they reject the governmentrun 
protestant church organization 
foreign catholic and protestant groups supply underground 
worshipers with bibles and other religious materials carried in by 
tourists 
china and the vatican have held behindthescenes talks for 
several years but do not appear near reaching agreement on 
rapprochement

the government must stop trying to turn national 
forests in the mountains of southern appalachia into tree farms 
says a conservation group which calls the us forest services 
plans for them seriously flawed 
the services plans for the six forests in virginia the 
carolinas tennessee and georgia continue to threaten the regions 
environment with extensive clearcutting road construction and 
other actions the wilderness society said in a report released 
today 
the government must begin developing a regional approach to 
protecting the forests which offer recreational and wildlife 
benefits not found anywhere else in the area the washingtonbased 
group said 
we want them to manage them as an ecosystem not just isolated 
units said peter kirby the societys southeastern regional 
director 
sen wyche fowler dga chairman of the agriculture 
subcommittee on conservation and forestry said in a statement that 
he was greatly disturbed by the report mountain treasures at 
risk and his panel would examine some of its findings 
the report released today at the groups southeastern regional 
headquarters here covers the jefferson national forest in virginia 
the cherokee pisgah and nantahala in tennessee and north carolina 
the sumter in south carolina and the chattahoochee in georgia which 
essentially surround the great smoky mountains national park 
the forests cover about 4700 square miles roughly the size of 
connecticut 
the wilderness society maintains that plans for the southern 
appalachian national forests are seriously flawed the report said 
while demand for wilderness recreation is increasing the forest 
service plans to designate 60 percent of the areas suitable to be 
made wilderness areas as suitable for timber production instead the 
report noted 
in the past decade the service doubled the volume of timber sold 
from the six forests from 63 million board feet in 1977 to 126 
million in 1986 plans call for doubling it again in 10 years and 
increasing it more than 350 percent by 2030 
the forests provide essentially the only wilderness areas in the 
region the service plans to build roads and cut old trees in remote 
areas which do not yet have official wilderness designation from 
congress and are essentially the only oldgrowth forests in the area 
it plans to build 3263 miles of roads which are built for 
logging in addition to the current 4951 miles balancing the cost 
against the sale price the agency reported a 55 million loss on 
timber sales from the six forests in fiscal 1987 the report said 
the service itself has admitted private forests could produce the 
timber it sells the report said 
the study said the service views wildlife management primarily 
as an adjunct of timber production in each individual forest when 
a regional approach is needed 
the society recommended an outside task force to evaluate the 
services plans establishing more wilderness areas phasing out 
timber sales stopping road construction reforming forestry 
practices and restructuring the agencys budget to provide more 
balance among the uses of the forests 
the forest service has previously defended its handling of 
national forests by pointing out that they have multiple uses 
logging recreation and wildlife management 
we get confused with national parks that are managed strictly 
for nontimber purposes cherokee national forest planning officer 
bob larkey said after conservationists appealed the plan for that 
forest in 1986 its very difficult to give everybody what they 
want

the dollar plunged against the japanese yen for the 
second consecutive day today while the tokyo stock exchanges 
leading index climbed to another record high in active trading 
the dollar closed at 12590 yen down 130 yen from tuesdays 
close of 12720 yen and down 240 yen from mondays finish it 
opened at 12630 yen the days high and plunged at one point to 
12580 yen 
the us currency thus has fallen 450 yen since hitting this 
years highest close of 13040 yen on feb 1 
dealers said the dollars decline today was due to growing 
pessimism in the market over us trade figures to be announced 
later this week 
they added that the weaker dollar led to expectations of a 
selloff by investment trusts before they closed their books for the 
year at the end of march 
exchange dealers said volume totaled 10582 billion second 
largest this year the previous high of 1070 billion was set 
friday when the dollar fell 174 yen 
on the tokyo stock exchange the 225issue nikkei average a 
243point loser tuesday gained 16659 points or 052 percent 
closing at a record 3214948 points 
stock traders said volume was estimated at 16 billion shares in 
the first section compared with 156 billion tuesday 
individual and foreign investors showed strong buying interest 
with their concern over political uncertainty linked to the 
socalled recruit scandal apparently subsiding the traders said 
prosecutors have arrested several people including hiromasa 
ezoe founder of the information services conglomerate recruit co 
on suspicion of giving bribes by offering bargainpriced stock to 
influential politicians and businessmen the scandal has rocked the 
government of prime minister noboru takeshita

afghanistan walked alone across a frontier bridge into the soviet 
union on wednesday completing the kremlins withdrawal from a 
costly nineyear war tass reported 
the soviet military adventure in its southern neighbor had 
claimed the lives of more than 15000 soviet soldiers and left 
35000 wounded 
lt gen boris gromov was the last soldier to cross the bridge 
into to soviet city of termez from the afghan town of khairaton the 
official news agency said 
he walked across the bridge over the amudarya river at 955 am 
moscow time tass said 
a moscow radio reporter in termez said 
there they are standing in front of us the lads who were the 
last to leave two battalions a reconnaissance one and airborne 
assault one left today everyone is wearing medals and smiling with 
satisfaction 
the dustcovered armored personnel carriers are still the guns 
of many of them are already under cover said the reporter whose 
broadcast was monitored in london 
that is it this war has come to an end 
with the forces gromov commanded gone major cities held by the 
sovietbacked government of president najib were expected to fall to 
the insurgents in a matter of weeks 
soviet media reported looting by troops of the 30000member 
afghan army and mass desertions as the guerrillas gain ground 
some garrisons have been plundered certain posts and 
strongholds transferred to the afghans have been emptied an 
article in trud said tuesday

richard arregui parked his car at a miami art gallery one day 
late last year and noticed something amiss an 8foot aluminum 
outdoor sculpture was now only 4 feet high 
someone had literally torn half of it off said arregui 
assistant director at the barbara gillman gallery he found the 
missing half of the 25000 sculpture hours later at a scrap yard 
they had paid 19250 for it 
in recent months thieves have stolen aluminum from practically 
everywhere to cash in on a prolonged boom in aluminum prices at 
scrap yards 
vandals have stripped siding and gutters from new york city 
homes faucets and window frames from a new orleans housing 
development swing sets from a miami playground bridge railing from 
connecticut highways and cans from chicago recycling bins 
nothing is sacred not even the historic brooklyn bridge 
a few months ago three men pried loose supports from the 
105yearold suspension bridges pedestrian walkway and from a 
catwalk used by ironworkers authorities said two were caught 
damage was estimated at 37000 and the walkway and catwalk were 
closed temporarily for repairs 
i think all this is a little nuts said officer bob hardy 
who in his queens precinct in new york city has investigated cases 
of stolen aluminum siding gutters and 100 posts from a foot bridge 
in the last month people are desperate for money thats what it 
is 
hardy and other police officers said the aluminum is stolen by 
crack addicts or scavengers authorities said the problem is limited 
to areas with markets to recycle aluminum a pound of the material 
can bring up to 60 cents triple the price three years ago 
unfortunately in our society many people will do illegal 
things to make money said frank rathbun spokesman for the 
aluminum association in washington dc when the price of 
aluminum is high enough people will steal aluminum its really not 
a surprise 
aluminum is swiped more often than other metals because of its 
high price and availability 
it is used in hundreds of products from beverage cans to 
airplanes more than 25 percent of the 16 billion pounds of aluminum 
made each year in the united states comes from recycled aluminum 
which is much cheaper than producing aluminum from ore 
we encourage recycling rathbun said adding quickly but 
legally of course we dont believe in taking bridges apart 
in new orleans a crew worked four days on an apartment at a 
housing project only to return each morning to see its repairs 
undone by thieves who removed all the aluminum in sight window 
frames mail boxes mail slots and faucet handles in eastern 
connecticut railings from six highway overpasses were stolen last 
year 
scavengers are even hitting on chicago recycling centers taking 
newspapers and aluminum left in special collection boxes said 
michele white program developer for the resource center 
if recycling is going to be viable in the city of chicago or 
anywhere scavengers are going to have to be stopped she said 
chicago police are now helping the recyclers by enforcing an old 
ordinance that makes it illegal to sort through junk on streets and 
alleys the first scavenger arrested was scheduled to face a 
misdemeanor charge in court friday 
mo ross manager of amf enterprises corp in new york and a 
40year veteran of the recycling business said the recent spate of 
thefts doesnt surprise him 
in the scrap business anything is possible said ross who 
doesnt buy scrap off the street youll see stealing all over the 
new york metropolitan area anything laying around loose they 
take it 
and a few things bolted down 
after the top half of the miami sculpture was taken the art 
gallery asked for police surveillance but several days later 
arregui arrived at work and the bottom half was gone 
all that was left were the bolts from the platform he said 
police never found the aluminum and have made no arrests 
the artist linda howard said she was shocked initially i 
have aluminum sculptures all over the country and nothing has ever 
even been defaced she said 
insurance covered the theft and howard said she will continue 
using aluminum because thats what i do 
the sculptures top half is in storage maybe we could use it 
as table sculpture arregui said

residents voted overwhelmingly to change the 
citys 81yearold form of government to give blacks a political 
voice prompting the naacp to say its discrimination lawsuit had 
been settled out of court 
voters approved the change to the citys 1908 charter tuesday by 
33373 votes or 70 percent to 14213 votes or 30 percent 
according to complete unofficial election results 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
sued tulsa in 1987 contending that atlarge balloting for city 
commissioners unconstitutionally diluted the minority black vote 
concentrated in north tulsa where 75 percent of the citys 42000 
blacks live 
the new charter creates a council with nine members to be elected 
by district including one in north tulsa the mayor who gains 
power under the new charter continues to be elected at large 
the result of the election was the basis of our lawsuit said 
hubert bryant an naacp attorney we claim victory this is 
something that the citizens of tulsa brought in but it was only 
possible by the filing of our lawsuit we are delighted that we were 
able to settle this out of court 
attorneys are scheduled to meet here march 9 with us magistrate 
john leo wagner to determine the lawsuits status under the new 
charter but bryant said naacp attorneys believe the charter 
addresses the lawsuits concerns 
we are satisfied but the court now must be satisfied he 
said 
election board officials had predicted a turnout of about 50000 
of the citys 225000 registered voters tuesday but poll workers 
said they were busier than expected despite rain 
the naacp lawsuit claimed tulsa had a history of racial 
discrimination that dated back to a 1921 race riot and continued 
through the citys government a north tulsa black has never been 
elected to the city commission 
tulsa voters have rejected four attempts in 35 years to change 
the citys government a 1969 proposal failed by 63 votes out of 
more than 23000 cast the most recent a 1973 proposal was 
defeated by a wide margin 
similar lawsuits in other cities have prompted federal judges to 
order a change to a more representative government the naacp filed 
its lawsuit against tulsa after winning a similar case in 
springfield ill 
tulsas traditional government has allowed commissioners to serve 
in executive and legislative functions under the new charter the 
mayor becomes the chief executive responsible for daytoday 
operations while the ninemember council elected by district 
handles legislative matters and approves mayoral actions 
what tulsans have proved is that this is a city with the 
confidence to make this kind of major change said mayor rodger 
randle who along with the citys four other elected commissioners 
campaigned in support of the new charter 
this is something ive thought we should have had for many 
years said police commissioner bob dick the lone republican on 
the commission who as a young tulsa police officer enforced the 
citys segregation laws 
so early on i was very sensitive to saying theres something 
very very wrong here dick said 
supporters of the measure had said better representation for 
black voters would be one of the benefits of changing the charter 
opponents had said the charter change would give the mayor too much 
power

can a nice guy finish first in the rowdy race for 
mayor of new york 
manhattan borough president david dinkins who announced his 
candidacy tuesday for the democratic nomination intends to find 
out in addition to whether hell be the first black man to hold the 
highest office in the nations largest city 
the 61yearold dinkins has a conciliatory manner that comes up 
in political discussions as frequently as his skin color which 
political analysts say could virtually guarantee him 30 percent of 
the vote 
supporters and even opponents like mayor edward i koch use 
the same words to describe dinkins who now leads all comers 
including the incumbent in the polls hes nice thoughtful 
cautious courteous the polite politician 
in other words hes no ed koch a combatative candidate known to 
shoot from the lip at the slightest provocation 
instead dinkins is known for forming committees including one 
to determine what was needed to make a run for mayor 
some people try to be critical of the fact that he gives 
reasoned well thoughtout opinions which should be valued in 
public officials said rep charles rangel dny 
ive been hearing a lot of pundits say hes too nice the 
congressman added anybody could be considered a nice guy compared 
to ed koch its all relative 
i am running because our city has become sharply polarized 
dinkins said in announcing his candidacy we need a mayor who can 
transcend differences so we can work together to solve our 
problems 
the name of the borough president the highest ranking black city 
official was tossed around for months before he entered the race 
koch who will run for an unprecedented fourth term annoyed many 
blacks last year by making disparaging remarks about jesse jackson 
during the presidential primary 
dinkins who supported jackson said he expected jackson to 
campaign for him this year 
for his part koch said he consider dinkins to be a very 
formidable candidate i perceive myself as the underdog thats not 
just rhetoric i think the polls show that i hope to turn them 
around 
i know that both he and i will conduct the election battle in a 
responsible way the mayor added 
though it seems everyone already has an opinion of koch 36 
percent of the voters said they didnt know enough about dinkins to 
have an opinion according to a daily news poll 
several polls have shown that dinkins would defeat koch and other 
potential democratic candidates such as city council president 
andrew stein special state prosecutor charles j hynes city 
councilwoman ruth w messinger and former us rep herman badillo 
hes warm tender generous quietly assertive is the 
opinion of percy sutton a longtime friend and former manhattan 
borough president himself he doesnt bring down buildings when he 
talks but hes quiet and firm 
his political career has been quiet by new york standards a 
former marine and graduate of brooklyn law school dinkins became 
hopelessly hooked on politics after winning a race for state 
assembly in 1965 
he lost two elections for borough president before winning in 
1985 
there had been an earlier setback dinkins admitted not filing 
income tax returns from 196871 which wrecked his chance to become 
a deputy mayor to abe beame dinkins paid 15000 in back taxes and 
admitted his negligence 
as borough president he and his staff have addressed numerous 
issues of importance to manhattan residents often by forming a task 
force housing and homelessness child welfare infant mortality 
drugs even pedestrian safety 
though he may have lost ground among some jewish voters by 
backing jackson for president dinkins has earned the respect of 
many others with his lobbying on behalf of soviet jews and 
denunciation of radical louis farrakhan 
and he warned dont be misled by his courtly manner 
let me tell you im also an exmarine dinkins said 
and i dont intend for a second to get shoved around in this or 
any other campaign so lets be clear on that

a black state senator has proposed a bill modeled 
after federal reparations to wartime japanese internees that would 
have massachusetts compensate blacks for the injuries of slavery and 
racism 
lawmakers in the state one of the first to outlaw slavery and a 
hotbed of abolitionism are not expected to approve the measure but 
a harvard law professor and other observers said it should spark a 
worthwhile debate 
the bills sponsor democratic sen bill owens of boston said 
the government and the countrys white majority have an obligation 
to acknowledge the wrong of slavery and the continued impact of 
racial discrimination 
whites he said tend to forget that we are the only people who 
gave to this country our work our labor and our lives as slaves 
and got nothing for it 
the measure which has yet to have a public hearing before a 
committee does not specify how much compensation should be paid and 
calls instead for creation of a commission to negotiate with 
legitimate representatives of african descendants 
owens proposal is modeled on a bill passed by congress last year 
which pays 125 billion in damages to japaneseamericans forced 
into internment camps during world war ii the law promises lumpsum 
payments of 20000 to more than 60000 japaneseamericans who were 
imprisoned without trial 
the japanese claim that they had been deprived of educational 
opportunity they had been deprived of housing and they had been 
deprived of employment which diminished their social and economic 
conditions owens said we suffered exactly the same thing 
owens said 
the vestiges of slavery as we view it continue even today 
the senator said 
as drafted the oneparagraph bill is likely to raise practical 
problems because it does not define people of african descent or 
state whether claims could be pressed only by descendants of former 
slaves 
slavery was outlawed in massachusetts in 1783 by the state 
supreme court which ruled that the practice violated the state 
constitution 
asked about the proposal gov michael s dukakis said he had not 
seen the bill but balked at the potential cost at this point 
were trying to make ends meet around here said dukakis who is 
facing a 600 million deficit 
the senates republican floor leader sen david locke also 
expressed surprise at the legislation and questioned its merits 
my concern is it drives a wedge betwen the black community and 
the white community and i think that should not be done locke 
said 
outside government the proposal drew a mixed assessment 
theres no question that from a moral standpoint its just 
said boston university historian howard zinn i dont think its 
going to happen of course 
but zinn said the idea was worth raising and pointed out that 
much of massachusetts early wealth came in part from the forced 
labor of blacks 
the value of senator owens bill is that its going to spark a 
debate said harvard law school professor derek bell adding that 
he doubted payments would ever be made but in terms of the 
legality its just as valid as the japaneseamerican reparations

youngsters who love milk should stick to 
the fatfree variety because dairy products have surpassed meat as 
the top source of unhealthy saturated fat in teenagers diets a 
researcher says 
studies by dr curtis ellison at two elite new england prep 
schools found that 35 percent of students daily intake of saturated 
fat comes from milk cheese ice cream and other dairy food 
preppies are not unique in what they eat according to ellison 
who said at least two other unpublished studies have reached similar 
conclusions 
the studies show that the main source of saturated fat is not 
meat anymore he said it is milk and other dairy products 
eating too much saturated fat raises cholesterol levels in the 
bloodstream this clogs the arteries that feed the heart decades of 
bad eating eventually can result in a heart attack but many experts 
believe that the damage begins early in life 
ellison measured the sources of salt and saturated fat in the 
diets of students at phillips exeter academy in new hampshire and 
phillips academy in andover mass as part of a study of dietary 
changes 
he found that after dairy products meat fish poultry and eggs 
provided 28 percent of the students saturated fat baked goods and 
cereals 16 percent ketchup gravy and other food adjuncts 7 
percent fruits and vegetables 7 percent snacks 6 percent and 
everything else 1 percent 
ellison said that many people shy away from red meat because of 
its fat content but they sometimes substitute kinds of cheese such 
as chedder cheese that contain far higher levels of saturated fat 
kids love milk he said some of them drink two liters a 
day and they grow up thinking that its a good thing to have we 
are not trying to take their milk away just take the fat out of 
it 
ellison presented his data tuesday at a program on school lunches 
held at massachusetts institute of technologys clinical research 
center 
ellison is among health experts who believe youngsters should cut 
down on saturated fat and salt to establish good eating habits and 
prevent coronary artery disease and high blood pressure as they get 
older 
salt aggravates high blood pressure and his prep school survey 
found that breakfast cereal and baked goods provide about 30 percent 
of the salt in teenagers diets meats add 21 percent dairy 
products 16 percent food adjuncts 12 percent fruits and vegetables 
9 percent snack foods 6 percent table salt less than 1 percent and 
all else 5 percent 
in dietary experiments at the academies ellison found that by 
substituting lowsalt recipes in the cafeterias cooks could make 
food that the students would eat but still reduce their salt 
consumption by 15 percent to 20 percent this also reduced the 
youngsters average blood pressure by about 2 points 
in another experiment cooks substituted polyunsaturated fat for 
saturated fat in recipes this reduced saturated fat consumption 
from 13 percent of total calories to 106 percent however because 
of problems measuring the youngsters blood cholesterol levels it 
was unclear what effect this had on their cardiovascular health 
ellison said the average cholesterol levels of us youngsters is 
between 160 and 170 the ideal is 110 although this is probably not 
obtainable if they follow a typical american diet 
our target is to get all children in the united states down 
around 140 over the next 10 years he said even with cholesterol 
levels this low some of them will still have cholesterol over 200 
after they reach adulthood

an advanced navigation satellite 
circled earth today boosted into orbit on the inaugural liftoff of 
the delta 2 the first of the postchallenger space rockets 
developed to launch vital military payloads 
it was in every way a picture perfect launch air force lt 
col bob tayloe the launch director said after tuesdays 
successful liftoff the satellite came up very strong and were 
receiving a good signal 
the delta 2 is the first of at least 54 new unmanned rockets the 
pentagon is ordering in a 14 billion program to launch muchneeded 
reconnaissance navigation communications and other national 
security satellites 
about 40 of these payloads have been grounded for lack of a 
launch vehicle since the shuttle challenger exploded three years 
ago killing seven astronauts 
as a result of the accident the air force decided it was a 
mistake to abandon unmanned rockets and to use the shuttle for sole 
access to space it ordered three new rocket systems the 
mediumsize delta 2 and atlas 2 and the large more powerful titan 4 
the delta 2 was the first to fly on its debut it carried into 
orbit the 65 million navstar global positioning satellite the 
first payload removed from the shuttle manifest to a throwaway 
rocket 
the satellite entered an initial elliptical orbit ranging from 
about 100 to 11000 miles above earth on thursday an onboard 
motor will be fired to shift the satellite into a circular orbit of 
about 11000 miles high 
the 3675pound satellite is an advanced version of of seven 
earlier model navstars currently in orbit it will enable us and 
allied military units such as ships planes submarines and tanks to 
locate their positions within 50 feet by using an encrpyted channel 
the accuracy for civilian users will be within 300 feet 
the satellite is the first of 21 of the upgraded navstars the air 
force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992 giving 
anyone anywhere in the world 24hour access to the positioning 
information 
the original plan was to launch all 21 on nasas space shuttle 
fleet but that idea was scrapped after the challenger explosion 
now only two remain scheduled on the shuttle 
the air force has ordered 20 delta 2s from mcdonnell douglas 23 
titan 4s from martin marietta and 11 atlas 2s from general dynamics 
it is negotiating for 26 more titan 4s 
the titan 4 is scheduled to make its first flight next month the 
atlas 2 debut is set for next year

secretary of state glen browder led a 
democratic primary election but will face a runoff with tuskegee 
mayor johnny ford who is seeking to become alabamas first black 
congressman since reconstruction 
the winner of their march 7 runoff will face republican state 
sen john rice in a special election in the 3rd congressional 
district which stretches through the mostly rural counties to the 
east and north of montgomery 
the april 4 election is being held to select a successor to 
democratic rep bill nichols who died in december at age 70 after 
serving 21 years 
browder 46 a former jacksonville state university professor who 
vaulted from the legislature to his statehouse post in 1986 edged 
ford by a 25to24 percent margin in tuesdays primary despite 
trailing in districtwide surveys in recent weeks 
it was a very competitive campaign browder said nobody 
walked away with this race i respect mayor ford very much and i 
think that well have a pretty sprited campaign 
ford 46 ran strongly in predominantly black macon county and 
drew well enough elsewhere to beat out state sen jim preuitt of 
talladega and state rep charles adams of phenix city 
we obviously received overwhelming support from the 
africanamerican community which is good ford said tuesday 
night now that were in the runoff much of the quiet white 
support we got will come out openly 
rice 37 seeking to claim a traditionally democratic district 
said the general election race will pit a conservative against a 
liberal 
the opelika real estate developer won his gop race without a 
runoff pulling about 62 percent of the vote 
blacks make up about 25 percent of the district the last time a 
black won a primary runoff spot for congress in alabama was in 1978 
when chris mcnair of birmingham ran against the eventual winner 
richard shelby of tuscaloosa in the 7th district

shantytown dwellers who lost loved ones when 
deadly gas from a union carbide plant enveloped the neighborhood in 
1984 say the 470 million settlement the company has agreed to is 
not punishment enough 
we have often been promised money but for us it was more 
important that those who killed our brothers and sisters should be 
hanged said sunil kumar 
the 15yearold kumar lost his parents and five siblings to the 
cloud of methyl isocyanante that escaped from a storage tank in the 
worlds deadliest industrial disaster 
at least 3329 people died from exposure to the gas released from 
a pesticide plant owned by the danbury connbased companys indian 
subsidiary 
the government says at least 20000 survivors still suffer 
shortness of breath eye problems and other ailments 
on tuesday the supreme court of india ended four years of legal 
wrangling and ordered union carbide to pay the 470 million in 
compensation 
the settlement was acceptable to both the company and india 
which had sought 3 billion 
today the court agreed to advance the date of payment from march 
31 to march 23 and to allow the companys indian subsidiary to pay 
45 million of the settlement with the parent company responsible 
for the remaining 425 million 
the news was slow to sink in at the jai prakash nagar shantytown 
across the road from the deserted union carbide plant which closed 
after the dec 3 1984 gas leak 
kumar still lives with a younger brother in the shack where his 
family slept as the white killing vapor wafted across the teeming 
squatter settlement 
this morning he was studying for high school examinations one 
of the few teenagers in the shantytown who can afford not to work 
he achieved this relative affluence soon after the disaster when 
the indian government gave nextofkin 10000 rupees then worth 
833 for each gas death in the family kumar received 70000 rupees 
throughout the shantytown today many people seemed unable to 
comprehend what the settlement would mean for them 
one man shanker lal said there had been promises of money in 
the past but he had yet to receive anything 
at a hospital near the camp shaukat bai a veiled woman in her 
mid20s waited for treatment for respiratory problems blamed on the 
gas pregnant at the time of the disaster she lost her unborn child 
in a miscarriage health workers blamed on the gas her husband was 
killed by the gas 
union carbide should have been stripped of its assets she 
said she said she thought pregnant women who suffered miscarriages 
or gave birth to stillborn babies should be given compensation 
local politicians who crusaded on the victims behalf were more 
vehement 
the rajiv gandhi government has committed an inhuman crime by 
undermining the extent of the disaster giriraj kishore president 
of the slum dwellers federation said referring to the prime 
minister and his congress party 
satinath sarangi a scientist and member of the bhopal group for 
information and action said this settlement is the final 
testimony to the antipeople collusion between the government of 
india and the union carbide corp 
alok pratap singh a leader of the poisonous gas episode struggle 
front that often organized anticarbide demonstrations called the 
470 million agreement a shameless settlement 
vibhuti jha a young lawyer for the front said the government 
had committed a criminal offense by agreeing to drop criminal 
charges against union carbide its indian subsidiary and corporate 
officials 
warren anderson chairman at the time of the gas leak and eight 
officials of union carbide of india ltd were charged in 1987 with 
culpable homicide in the disaster 
they never appeared for trial and the supreme court quashed the 
charges when it ordered union carbide to pay the full and final 
settlement 
dainik bhaskar a bhopal daily newspaper called the settlement 
niggardly and inadequate and said it set a dangerous precedent 
for the third world where people are considered guinea pigs by the 
multinationals

the chicago symphony may have made its reputation 
playing mahler wagner and beethoven but it will make contemporary 
works an important part of its future says newly appointed music 
director daniel barenboim 
the 46yearold barenboim meeting with reporters for the first 
time since being named jan 30 to replace sir georg solti in 
september 1991 said he doesnt plan any sweeping changes 
but he added i dont want to pay lip service to contemporary 
music and i dont expect everybody to agree with my choices and 
like them 
if we are limited to the music of the past all our 
institutions will become like wellequipped museums 
barenboim said he has planned world or american premieres for 
each of the five subscription weeks that he will work as a guest 
conductor next season 
in march for instance the cso under barenboims guidance will 
play four works by composer maurice ravel but also unveil a work by 
toro takemitsu commissioned in honor of the orchestras centennial 
barenboim cautioned tuesday he wont undertake the new works 
simply to tinker 
after spending the last 13 years as musical director of 
lorchestre de paris a post in which solti also preceded him 
barenboim has nothing but the utmost respect for the master solti 
who led the cso since 1969 will become conductor laureate beginning 
with the 199192 season 
because of its association with sir georg i find an orchestra 
at a level of excellence that is very rare and it would be 
presumptuous of me to say im going to change that said barenboim 
but it is also true that when you find something very good you 
cannot simply hope to gain hold of it and keep it like that there 
is a fluidity to life as well and it is important to keep that in 
mind barenboim said 
at the hourlong news conference barenboim was asked repeatedly 
whether there had been a resolution of his muchpublicized dispute 
with officials of the bastille opera in paris 
barenboim was fired last month as musical and artistic director 
at the new paris opera house losing a salary of 11 million over 
four years as well as the chance to guide the ambitious project in 
its infancy 
he declined to discuss the matter in detail but hinted that one 
of the mozart operas that was being considered for the opening of 
the paris opera house may well wind up elsewhere 
barenboim born in argentina and raised in israel was already 
a worldfamous pianist when he performed as a guest conductor in 
1970 with the chicago symphony 
my weaknesses are known to them their strengths are known to 
me he said of the chicago musicians that should augur well for 
the future

a space probe grounded for 3 years by 
the challenger explosion has been rebuilt for an october launch to 
jupiter where it will plunge to its doom as it seeks clues to the 
birth of the solar system 
the 136 billion galileo mission should climax in december 1995 
when the probe deploys a parachute and collects information for 75 
minutes before it is crushed by jupiters intense atmospheric 
pressure 
its mother ship the galileo orbiter will circle the planet for 
22 months 
hughes aircraft co planned to deliver the refurbished 157 
million galileo probe late this afternoon in pasadena where nasas 
jet propulsion laboratory is completing modifications to the orbiter 
this is a very proud day for us we are ready to deliver it to 
jpl on its way to jupiter hughes vice president steven dorfman 
said at a news conference tuesday 
jpl will send the 4footdiameter teardropshaped probe to 
kennedy space center in florida in late april followed by the 
orbiter in midmay the probe and orbiter then will be hooked up 
together placed atop a booster rocket and finally loaded into the 
cargo bay of the shuttle atlantis 
the shuttle set for launch no earlier than oct 12 and no later 
than about nov 21 will release the combined galileo spacecraft 
into earth orbit then galileos rocket will fire sending the 
orbiter and probe on a circuitous 24billionmile sixyear voyage 
to the solar systems largest planet which is the fifth planet from 
the sun and is about 400 million miles from earth 
en route to the giant gaseous planet galileo will observe two 
asteroids the probe and orbiter will separate 150 days before they 
reach jupiter then fly in tandem until the probe enters the 
atmosphere at 115000 mph the probe will deploy a parachute and 
descend about 370 miles through jovian skies until it is crushed by 
pressure more than 25 times earths atmosphere 
data from the probe will help scientists better understand the 
origin of jupiter the solar system and the universe said richard 
young galileo probe project scientist at the national aeronautics 
and space administrations ames research center in mountain view 
scientists believe the jovian atmosphere could be a sample of the 
original material from which stars are formed according to a hughes 
statement 
the orbiter will measure jupiters electrical particle and 
magnetic fields and snap 50000 photographs of the planet and its 
moons including io europa ganymede and callisto which were 
discovered in 1610 by italian astronomer galileo galilei 
the spacecraft had been scheduled for launch from a space shuttle 
in may 1986 and powered out of orbit atop a centaur booster for a 
threeyear trip to jupiter but challenger exploded on jan 28 
1986 killing its crew of seven and grounding the shuttle fleet 
until last fall 
after the tragedy nasa decided it was too dangerous to carry 
liquidfueled centaur rockets aboard the shuttle galileos route to 
jupiter was drastically redesigned and lengthened from three years 
to six because earth and jupiter are no longer aligned as ideally as 
they were in 1986 and because galileos new solidfueled booster is 
less powerful 
the launch delay and longer flight time prompted a decision to 
take the probe apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts 
wouldnt fail because of aging 
white house approval for the launch is expected in september 
said richard spehalski galileo project manager at jpl such 
approval is needed because the probe and orbiter each carry a power 
plant and heater containing radioactive plutonium a nasa 
environmental impact statement concluded last month that the risk of 
a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off with galileo is very 
small

the dollar was trading today at lower levels in 
thin late morning european dealings 
gold prices fell 
the dollar was being undermined by a growing feeling that any 
discount rate hike by the us federal reserve would be matched by 
the west german bundesbank said one trader with a major italian 
commercial bank in milan 
in addition it was being pressured by statements by president 
bush indicating he wasnt unduly worried by inflation fears he said 
bushs statement was received fairly neutrally in europe on 
tuesday but not in new york they really sold the dollar off the 
trader said 
the dollar has been strong recently primarily due to 
expectations of a tighter monetary policy by the fed 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins

the head of the astronaut corps at the johnson 
space center has denied a published report that he failed two eye 
tests for colorblindness although he did not specifically deny that 
he is colorblind 
daniel c brandenstein who is scheduled to command a shuttle 
mission this year made his comments monday following a story in the 
houston chronicle that said he and astronaut frederick c hauck 
received wavers for medical conditions that otherwise would have 
grounded them 
hauck said the allegation that brandenstein is colorblind is 
absurd 
without going into detail its not accurate brandenstein 
told the houston post in response to claims from an anonymous caller 
to the newspaper that the astronaut had failed two colorblindness 
tests 
i have a long record of operational flying in the navy with no 
problem he added 
although james c fletcher nasas chief administrator refused 
to comment on the medical records of brandenstein and hauck he 
issued a statement saying he is confident that nasa flight rules are 
not being violated 
i am confident that the system has not been abrogated and that 
no one flies without qualifying by the book fletcher said 
like other nasa officials fletcher would not discuss any 
individual medical records on the grounds that such records are 
legally a private matter 
sources at the johnson space center said hauck underwent special 
medical treatment last year to dissolve a kidney stone and 
brandenstein received a waiver earlier keeping him on flight status 
despite colorblindness the chronicle reported

the family of a motorcycle passenger who was killed 
in the incident that touched off three days of race riots last month 
has filed a 10 million lawsuit against the city 
the lawsuit filed in us district court by the family of allan 
blanchard accuses miami police of allowing a pattern of activity 
that has violated suspects civil rights during the past decade 
tuesdays lawsuit names as defendants the city mayor xavier 
suarez police chief perry anderson and his department and officer 
william lozano a hispanic who shot the driver of the motorcycle on 
which blanchard was riding 
also tuesday anderson said he will not consider a request by 
hispanic officers for reassignment from black neighborhoods because 
of tension following the shooting of the black motorcyclist 
they have a responsibility as police officers to serve this 
community even throughout the rough times anderson said i 
would never even contemplate any type of reassignment 
an attorney for the hispanic officers association had written a 
letter to anderson complaining that tension for hispanic officers in 
black neighborhoods is becoming unbearable 
miami police say 25 hispanic officers work in the liberty city 
and overtown sections two predominantly black areas where looting 
and violence erupted after the shooting of motorcyclist clement 
lloyd on jan 16 
in the lawsuit attorney mark rubin said blanchard who also was 
black was the victim of wrongful death and deprivation of civil 
rights he was fatally injured in an accident that immediately 
followed lloyds shooting 
in describing the alleged pattern of police behavior rubin cited 
the 1979 police beating death of a black insurance executive the 
1986 drownings of three drug suspects and the 1988 police shooting 
of a black man who washed car windshields for money 
lozano pleaded innocent monday to criminal charges of 
manslaughter with a firearm in the deaths of lloyd 23 and 
blanchard 24 a june 19 trial date has been set

balloonist fumio niwa floated on toward north 
america today despite a compressor failure 14 hours into his attempt 
to make the first solo balloon crossing of the pacific ocean a 
spokesman said 
thirteen hours after taking to the air niwas huge orange and 
blue heliumfilled balloon was about 310 miles southeast of tokyo 
and flying at 12900 feet said project spokesman tadakatsu izumi 
niwa 38 who quit his job in a computer company three months ago 
to prepare for the flight had left yokohama before dawn aiming for 
san diego 
his plan was to grab a ride on the highspeed jet stream at about 
26000 feet altitude and travel 5000 miles to north america in four 
days but weather reports said the jet stream was angled more to 
the north than usual and might carry niwa to alaska 
izumi said niwa was staying at a low altitude by holding on to 
his ballast so the balloon would drift farther south before entering 
the jet stream 
all i see is clouds and the ocean izumi quoted niwa as 
saying by radio from the balloons cramped gondola its boring i 
have nothing to take a picture of 
before he lifted off niwa was aware of the problem with the wind 
direction 
my long dream of crossing the pacific is coming true today 
niwa said i still wonder if its really possible the jet stream 
is bending strangely but america is big so i think ill make it 
somewhere 
izumi said niwa reported in a radio contact that one compressor 
used to maintain air pressure inside the gondola had failed but the 
pilot was using the sole standby compressor to continue the flight 
the compressor sucks in the thin highaltitude air and keeps 
pressure inside the hightech plastic gondola at normal levels 
in 1981 four men crossed the pacific in a balloon from japan to 
the united states for the first time but no one has done it alone 
the gondola the fifth niwa has designed is 6 feet in diameter 
but is not tall enough for him to stand it has no heating to 
protect niwa from nighttime temperatures of about minus 50 degrees 
but his flying suit has builtin electric coils to keep him warm 
the coils are powered by batteries charged by solar panels outside 
the gondola 
besides the compressor problem izumi said niwa was bothered by 
many amateur radio operators who found his frequency and called him 
to chat the spokesman said they had changed frequency but the 
amateurs were still calling 
niwa who has about 1000 hours of ballooning experience 
estimated the flight will cost about 540000 he said money 
constraints kept him from installing alarms to warn him of a loss of 
gas in the balloon or a sudden change in altitude 
niwa planned to sleep during daylight hours and stay awake at 
night when problems are more likely

nondenominational invocations 
will be allowed at football games and other extracurricular events 
in the okaloosa county school system until the us supreme court 
rules on the prayer issue 
the school board agreed tuesday night to settle a lawsuit filed 
by a jewish family that objected to prayers at football games both 
sides said they would await the outcome of a similar case in georgia 
that is expected to go to the supreme court 
board member jim harkins jr who cast the lone vote against the 
settlement said he objected because prayers in the name of jesus 
christ would not be allowed 
we can pray in gods name said school board lawyer david 
selby but we will not pray to mohammed we will not pray to 
buddha we will not end a prayer in the name of the father the son 
and the holy ghost or in jesus name 
the lawsuit filed in november 1987 objected to what then were 
primarily christian prayers offered by protestant ministers at high 
school and junior high football games 
without the settlement the case would have gone to trial feb 27 
in us district court in pensacola 
the lawsuit was filed by air force master sgt mark berlin who 
is stationed at nearby eglin air force base his wife jan and 
their children tammy and max with the support of the new 
yorkbased american jewish congress 
i think both sides got what they wanted said marc stern a 
lawyer for the family we did quite well 
as part of the settlement the board agreed to pay 32000 in 
fees and legal expenses of the berlins 
a decision last month in a similar case by the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals in atlanta led to the settlement a threejudge 
panel ruled 21 that nonsectarian prayers before public school 
football games in douglas county ga were unconstitutional even if 
they were offered by laymen rather than ministers 
the appeals court ruled the primary purpose of the prayers was to 
advance religion which violated the first amendments doctrine of 
separation of church and state and its religious freedom guarantees 
douglas county school officials have asked for a rehearing before 
the full appeals court which numbers about 30 judges and failing 
that will appeal to the supreme court selby said 
he said the case would go to the supreme court regardless of 
which side wins at the appellate level and it may take up to two 
years to settle the issue

financial institutions who have a direct stake 
in the outcome of the savings and loan industry bailout contributed 
38 million to members of congress who will shape the legislation 
it was reported 
the members of congressional banking panels accepting campaign 
contributions from groups representing financial institutions vastly 
outnumbered those who rejected money from political action 
committees the los angeles times reported today 
in their last election campaigns legislators accepting pac money 
outnumbered those who refused it by 70 to 1 the newspaper reported 
bank pacs contributed about 29 million savings and loans gave 
about 680000 and credit unions donated about 210000 according 
to figures compiled for the times 
charles o zuver who lobbies for the credit union national 
association said pac contributions are aimed in part at gaining 
access to legislators 
if you do something for somebody theyll usually remember 
you he said 
president bushs bailout proposal would increase federal 
insurance premiums substantially more for thrifts than banks to 
help repay 90 billion to depositors at failed institutions 
the plan also calls for doubling the savings and loans level of 
capital which would take away an advantage they have over banks it 
also would require federal bank regulators to oversee the thrifts 
senate banking committee members among the top 10 recipients of 
pac contributions from banks and savings and loans are donald w 
riegle jr dmich terry sanford dnorth carolina jim sasser 
dtenn jake garn rutah and alan cranston dcalif the 
newspaper said 
those on the top 10 list of recipients serving on the house 
banking committee include stephen l neal dnorth carolina john 
hiler rind elizabeth patterson dsouth carolina and david e 
price dnorth carolina 
while rep richard h lehman dcalif a member of the house 
banking committee said it would be naive to believe pac money 
wields no influence he contended that critics exaggerate it 
lehman received 20400 from banks savings and loans and credit 
unions for his 1988 campaign 
i dont think it pac money will have any impact at all 
said riegle senate banking housing and urban affairs committee 
chairman he accepted 183000 from pacs during his reelection 
campaign 
federal election commission records show the new chairman of the 
house banking committee rep henry b gonzalez dtexas received 
5500 from bank pacs in his reelection campaign last year he also 
received 1500 from savings and loans and 1200 from credit unions 
gonzalez in a letter to the san antonio expressnews professed 
disdain for pac money saying no pac money from banks has ever

sergei khrushchev was on a roll 
the son of former soviet premier nikita khrushchev was telling a 
story about a bit of advice his father once gave him he looked up 
at the audience chuckled paused for effect 
and the translator muffed the punch line 
though flustered by the audiences silence the 54yearold 
soviet computer scientist really could not have made his point more 
eloquently 
he was giving a news conference tuesday on his first trip to the 
united states in 30 years and the main thrust of his remarks was 
that soviets and americans still have great difficulty understanding 
each other 
it seems to me that the main thing is weve come to understand 
how poorly we actually understand each other and those 
misunderstandings have led to missteps even at the highest levels 
he said 
it is a point of particular importance to khrushchev these days 
because he has been vigorously denying american news reports that he 
said cuban leader fidel castro urged his father to launch a nuclear 
strike on the united states during the 1962 cuban missile crisis 
those reports came out of a historic threeday conference in 
moscow last month that brought soviet cuban and american 
policymakers from that era together to discuss the missile crisis 
several newspapers reported that sergei khrushchev dropped a 
bombshell on the conference by privately telling participants that 
on oct 26 1962 near the height of the crisis castro sought a 
preemptive nuclear strike on the united states to forestall what he 
believed was an imminent invasion of cuba 
after the translator botched khrushchevs story tuesday the 
soviet said he thought a similar loss in translation may have 
resulted in the disputed reports from moscow 
david a welch a harvard research fellow who attended the 
conference gave a possible explanation for the reports 
he said many us scholars believe castro asked for soviet troops 
to fire antiaircraft missiles at american military jets flying over 
cuba 
when someone said castro asked khrushchev to fire the missiles 
journalists may have thought he was talking about the nuclear 
missiles welch said 
welch added however that i wouldnt rule out entirely the 
possibility that castro asked for a nuclear strike if castro did 
make that request it would be a politically very awkward fact to 
admit 
the moscow conference was the culmination of a sixyear harvard 
study of the missile crisis which brought the superpowers to the 
brink of nuclear war as president john f kennedy ordered a naval 
quarantine of cuba and demanded that the soviets remove their 
nuclear rockets from the island 
the world sat glued to televisions and radios as soviet ships 
steamed toward the quarantine line and what seemed like an 
inevitable military confrontation but nikita khrushchev eventually 
backed down and pulled out the missiles in return for an american 
pledge not to invade cuba 
the boston globe reported today that the united states was 
considering attacking cuba and had aircraft and ammunition in place 
before the soviet missiles were discovered there 
one document said plans for an air attack an invasion or both 
were finished and troops were ordered into final readiness for 
combat between oct 8 and oct 12 1962 the globe said 
robert s mcnamara secretary of defense at the time and 
mcgeorge bundy kennedys national security adviser have said the 
administration had no thoughts of invading cuba at the time 
the newspaper said it got a copy of the report from graham 
allison dean of harvard universitys kennedy school of government 
where khrushchev spoke 
sergei khrushchev whose father died in 1971 said tuesday that 
the crisis illustrated the danger of misunderstandings between the 
superpowers he also said there is a better opportunity today than 
at any time in the past 25 years for an improvement in 
sovietamerican relations 
in the past unity between peoples was considered science 
fiction but today we see that as a real possibility he said

the supreme court today agreed to a 
proposal by union carbide corp for its indian subsidiary to pay 
part of the 470 million settlement in the 1984 bhopal gas disaster 
that killed 3300 people 
a fivejudge bench also issued an order protecting the danbury 
connbased multinational and its employees from any future suits 
claims or criminal complaints concerning the worlds worst 
industrial disaster 
the court advanced the date of payment from march 31 to march 23 
to enable the indian government to record the payment before the 
governments fiscal year ends this could speed up distribution to 
gas victims 
the supreme court on tuesday in an effort to end four years of 
legal wrangling ordered union carbide to pay the entire 470 
million dollars in full and final settlement for damages from 
the disaster 
it said further litigation efforts would be dismissed 
the court said the payment would be used for the benefit of all 
victims of the disaster and not as fines penalties or punitive 
damages 
however it gave no immediate details of how much money should be 
paid for death injury medical care job rehabilitation or any 
other categories frequently mentioned by victims and political 
activists 
more than 20000 people still suffer from exposure to the gas and 
victims continue to die at a rate of at least one a day according 
to a government gas relief board 
union carbide of india ltd a subsidiary of the usbased 
multinational is the owner of the pesticide plant in the central 
indian city of bhopal where methyl isocyanate leaked out of a 
storage tank on dec 3 1984 
under todays decision the indian subsidiary will pay the rupee 
equivalent of 45 million the parent company is responsible for the 
remaining 425 million 
the order should enable the us company to make the payments 
without financial complications 
james wilbur a vice president with smith barney harris upham 
and co inc in new york said tuesday that union carbide had set 
aside 200 million toward the settlement and had 250 million in 
insurance coverage 
meanwhile a senior official of the indian subsidiary said the 
company may soon decide on the fate of the bhopal plant which has 
stood idle since the disaster 
now that the curtain has finally come down we will sit down 
and decide what to do said kishore hattangdi corporate 
communication manager of the company but we have miles to go

a jurys finding that the federal government and 
massachusetts port authority were to blame for the 1982 crash of a 
world airways jet here came as surprise the airlines attorney says 
the us district court jury tuesday exonerated world airways in 
the crash in which a dc10 carrying 105 passengers and 12 crew 
members slid off an icy runway at logan international airport two 
passengers were presumed killed and 39 were injured 
world airways the federal government and massport which 
operates logan have blamed each other for the accident 
david w davis executive director of massport which operates 
logan could not immediately say whether the agency would appeal 
tuesdays verdict 
i felt very strongly and still feel that the principal cause of 
the accident was pilot error but for whatever reason the jury has 
felt differently and were going to have to go on from there 
davis said 
james meehan chief counsel for world airways said the decision 
was a wonderful and hardfought victory 
it took seven years to put the pieces of what happened that 
night together meehan said and finally to lay the 
responsibility where it should rest for world airways and thats 
with massport and the federal government and they fought it all the 
way 
a new trial to determine who will pay what percentage of damages 
was scheduled to begin feb 27 in us district court here 
meehan said that although the jury assigned blame to both the 
federal aviation administration and massport world airways would 
seek to recover damages only from the port authority 
under federal law interest on the cost of compensation the lost 
aircraft and the rescue of passengers and crew from the wrecked 
aircraft cannot be assessed on the us government 
but we can recover the full amount from massport and thats 
what we intend to do meehan said 
meehan said the ruling came as a pleasant surprise following us 
district judge robert e keetons 1986 ruling which found world 
airways 50 percent responsible for the accident massport 30 percent 
responsible and the federal government 20 percent responsible 
at the time keeton said massport had failed to close the runway 
despite hazardous conditions and that neither it nor the faa had 
informed world airways that conditions had deteriorated 
massport and the federal government have maintained however 
that the crash was caused by pilot error 
keeton made his ruling after a previous jury failed to reach a 
verdict and a mistrial was declared 
lawyers for both sides said it was not immediately clear how the 
divergent decisions would affect one another but meehan said 
keetons ruling was binding solely on the us government

the red army commander for afghanistan 
today led the last contingent of his troops across a border bridge 
ending for the soviets a nineyear war that claimed the lives of 
15000 of their countrymen 
that is it this war has come to an end a moscow radio 
correspondent said from the scene 
about 200 cheering windburned soldiers clutching automatic 
rifles and riding mudspattered armored personnel carriers roared 
across the steel bridge spanning the amu darya river just 40 minutes 
before the noon withdrawal deadline set by an accord signed in april 
i wasnt looking back said lt gen boris gromov the 
commander after the red army officially left afghanistans army 
alone to face moslem guerrillas in a 10yearold civil war 
he rode in the last armored personnel carrier and was met halfway 
across the bridge by his 14yearold son maxim who carried a 
bouquet of flowers 
together they walked the final yards to termez 
the 45yearold general at times appearing near tears was 
kissed by a soldier then climbed atop an armored personnel carrier 
to be taken to a dusty hillside for the official welcoming ceremony 
some at the ceremony said getting involved in a neighbors civil 
war was a mistake 
it was a clear error so many died said senior sgt asgat 
husayinov 22 he said afghanistan was a hell after which you fear 
nothing except maybe yourself the soldiers at the ceremony 
received watches sent on the orders of defense minister dmitri t 
yazov 
lt col igor azarenok of the defense ministry said gromovs 
group was the last to leave ending what many soviets have come to 
view as their vietnam 
in moscow the communist party daily pravda said leonid 
brezhnevs decision in 1979 to send troops to afghanistan may have 
been an error it suggested future commitments of soviet forces 
abroad should be sanctioned by parliament 
it called the withdrawal the first step toward peace in 
afghanistan 
with gromov and his troops gone guerrilla leaders have predicted 
that major cities held by the sovietbacked government will fall in 
a matter of weeks if not days 
soviet media have reported looting by troops of the 30000member 
afghan army and mass desertions as the ussupplied guerrillas 
gain ground 
soviet officials estimate 30000 guerrillas are massed around the 
cold hungry capital of kabul which has been blockaded for months 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev said another 15000 
guerrillas were around the eastern city of jalalabad kabul radio 
monitored by the british broadcasting corp reported more 
insurgents surrounding herat and khandahar 
guerrillas claimed there was heavy fighting around a former 
soviet airbase north of kabul 
along the muddy narrow streets of kabuls bazaar merchants 
huddling under thick quilts seemed more interested in bartering for 
their goods than discussing the soviet withdrawal 
the russians are gone said one trying to sell soviet fur 
hats now there will be peace 
there was no announcement on national radio or television about 
the final departure only those with access to bbc radio heard the 
news 
the decision to intervene in afghanistan was made by the late 
president brezhnev and a few close associates highranking 
officials have said pravda said the security threat perceived by 
them may not have merited sending in troops 
it is possible to doubt the brezhnev leaderships evaluation of 
the level of military ttest pain and worry for 
our people scientists politicians soldiers and all other people 
will be thinking and debating for a long time whether the decision 
of the government of the country taken at that time was right 
pravda continued it is possible to say that such vitally 
important decisions as the use of troops cannot be decided secretly 
by a small circle of people without the sanction of the parliament 
of the country 
the soviet parliament has been a rubberstamp body for decades 
but recent reforms under president mikhail s gorbachev have 
strengthened its role 
a spokesman for the pakistanbased jamiatiislami guerrilla 
group said its fighters captured 155 afghan government soldiers and 
10 officers in an attack saturday on the huge bagram airbase 24 
miles north of the capital 
he said 10 guerrillas were killed or wounded and that fighting 
continued today but he gave no details and there was no 
independent confirmation 
kabul state radio said guerrillas fired five rockets into the 
capital on tuesday killing four children and an old man lined up in 
the snow for bread 
it said two rockets landed at the airport 
the final soviet troops in kabul left aboard military transport 
planes late tuesday 
soviet soldiers intervened in afghanistan a year after a marxist 
coup touched off civil war with moslem guerrillas at the height of 
its involvement the red army had an estimated 115000 soldiers in 
the country 
under a unmediated accord signed in geneva in april the 
withdrawal began may 15

turner entertainment co said it will not 
colorize orson welles blackandwhite film classic citizen kane 
because the late directors estate may have the right to prohibit it 
a storm of criticism blew up in january when the company revealed 
it was colorizing test scenes director henry jaglom said welles 
specifically asked him to protect the movie from such treatment two 
weeks before he died in 1985 
turner entertainment which is part of ted turners broadcasting 
empire obtained partial rights to citizen kane with the 1986 
acquisition of mgms film library and remaining rights from rko 
pictures in 1987 
turner president roger mayers announcement tuesday that 
preparations to color the film had stopped indicated that it was a 
legal decision rather than a bow to those who claim coloring 
artistically spoils a blackandwhite film 
our attorneys looked at the contract between rko pictures inc 
and orson welles and his production company mercury productions 
inc and on the basis of their review we have decided not to 
proceed with colorization of the movie mayer said 
while a court test might uphold our legal right to colorize the 
film provisions of the contract could be read to prohibit 
colorization without permission of the welles estate we have 
completed restoration of a printing negative which now enables us to 
show firstrate black and white prints of this masterpiece 
citizen kane is considered one of the finest american movies 
ever made welles starred in and directed the 1941 saga of a wealthy 
and reclusive newspaper publisher 
jaglom recounted last month that welles was adamant about not 
letting his film be tinted 
orson said to me at lunch about two weeks before he died i 
remember this vividly please do this for me dont let ted turner 
deface my movie with his crayons jaglom said 
movie purists have previously lamented the colorizing of such 
classics as its a wonderful life casablanca and a 
christmas carol 
proponents claim adding color gives films a wider audience

companies at the center of a stock trading scandal news reports 
said bringing to six the number of people charged in the affair 
the managing director of recruit co a fastgrowing business 
information conglomerate and the managing director of a real estate 
subsidiary recruitcosmos co were arrested on charges of 
violating the securities and exchange law television and news 
agency reports said 
they identified those arrested as shunjiro mamiya of recruit and 
seiichi tateoka of recruitcosmos 
prosecution officials refused to discuss the reports saying they 
would talk only to reporters from a handful of japanese news 
organizations assigned to covering their office 
the parent company sold valuable stocks in the subsidiary to 
dozens of politicians their aides and influential businessmen and 
journalists 
todays reported arrests came two days after the parent companys 
founder and three others were arrested on bribery charges 
prosecutors monday arrested recruits founder hiromasa ezoe an 
executive of a recruitaffiliated finance company and two executives 
of nippon telephone and telegraph corp japans largest company 
recruitcosmos sold hundreds of thousands of shares prior to 
their public listing to the political and business figures the 
stocks soared in value after being made available for 
overthecounter trading bringing huge profits to the purchasers 
those arrested monday were held on suspicion of bribery involving 
resale of usmade supercomputers by ntt to recruit and leasing 
telephone lines to recruit at discount prices 
thirty officers from the prosecutors office searched ntts 
downtown tokyo offices for more than eight hours tuesday 
confiscating documents that filled 70 boxes 
mamiya played a central role in the sale of recruitcosmos 
stocks while tateoka looked after the financial aspect of the 
transactions according to the reports 
the sales were not illegal under japanese law but give the 
impression of influencepeddling and raised outcries among the 
public and in parliament about political fundraising and ethics in 
government 
more than a dozen members of parliament including three 
incumbent cabinet ministers former top bureaucrats and senior 
businessmen have stepped down from public positions because of their 
link to the scandal 
most of the politicians and political aides so far named in the 
recruit affair have come from prime minister takeshitas governing 
liberal democratic party which has come under increasingly harsh 
public criticism because of the scandal 
the liberal democrats lost a parliamentary seat to the japan 
socialist party in a byelection last sunday in what was widely seen 
as a referendum on public support for takeshitas government 
opposition parties have repeatedly insisted that takeshita and 
his cabinet resign over the affair but takeshita has rejected the 
calls

the presidents of five central 
american countries have agreed to dismantle military bases used by 
nicaraguan rebels in honduras and to hold elections in nicaragua 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua said his leftist government 
will move up elections to february 1990 and let the opposition help 
organize them 
the presidents said they would devise a plan within 90 days for 
disbanding the usbacked rebel force in honduras estimated at 
11000 fighters 
the accord was reached tuesday at the end of a twoday summit 
meeting 
were ready to return to nicaragua when we see that ortega 
seriously is going to begin implementing his promises adolfo 
calero a member of the contra directorate told a news conference 
the united states cut off military aid to the contras 12 months 
ago 
the summit produced an eightpage accord the presidents said 
would reinvigorate the regional peace plan they signed 18 months ago 
president jose azcona of honduras whose country became the 
contras haven at the urging of the united states said he expected 
washington to back the agreement there was no immediate comment 
from the state department 
we believe we have adopted a decision in the interest of the 
five central american countries we also believe that the united 
states will respect the accord that we have signed this day 
azcona told a news conference 
what remained unresolved was the issue of verification of 
progress toward democracy under the central american peace plan 
ortega promised to move up national elections which had been 
scheduled for november 1990 and to hold local elections at the same 
time 
his term is to end in january 1991 but members of the ruling 
sandinista party have indicated that could change 
ortega said opposition parties would have equal access to radio 
and television which the government now controls and 
representation on the national election commission 
he also said the entire election process would be open to 
international observers 
nicaragua promised to free about 1600 imprisoned contras and 
members of the national guard of dictator anastasio somoza who was 
overthrown in 1979 by the revolution the sandinistas rode to power 
the fiveway agreement on disbanding the contras adopted at the 
urging of both nicaragua and honduras calls for the rebels and 
their families to be offered voluntary repatriation or relocation to 
third countries 
the contra leaders consigned to the sidelines during the 
negotiations over their fate and safe haven were stung by the 
agreement 
i would say whatever accord is reached based on ortegas 
promises is equivalent to trying to leash a dog with sausage 
links calero said after the summit 
costa rican president oscar arias who won the 1987 nobel peace 
prize for authoring the regional peace plan said the international 
community should help relocate the contras and their estimated 
10000 family members 
he said those who sponsored the contras for many years should 
feel most responsible for finding them new homes 
ortegas promises of democratization said contra directorate 
member roberto ferrey signaled the burial of the sandinista 
dictatorship 
for their part sandinista officials said they came to the summit 
looking for help in burying what ortega has called the contra 
cadaver and declaring nicaraguas readiness for democracy 
that readiness they said sprang from the military and political 
defeat of the contras and the change of administrations in 
washington 
the bush administration has said it would prefer a diplomatic 
solution to the eightyear nicaraguan conflict over the military 
option the reagan administration had so vigorously pursued 
the central american summit at this beach resort 25 miles 
southeast of san salvador was the regional leaders first meeting in 
13 months and took place after five postponements 
the last presidents meeting was in january 1988 the deadline 
for implementing the provisions of the regional peace plan 
the plan calls for an end to outside aid to insurgents political 
amnesties and democratic reforms it bars each signatory from 
letting its territory be used for insurgent attacks on neighboring 
nations 
the plan was a catalyst for a ceasefire signed last march by the 
contras and the sandinistas but it has not quelled civil wars in el 
salvador and guatemala 
in the summit document arias azcona and presidents jose 
napoleon duarte of el salvador and vinicio cerezo of guatemala took 
formal note of nicaraguas new pronouncements about democratization

a man has been sentenced to life in prison for 
sexually assaulting his 9yearold stepdaughter a leukemia victim 
authorities say the 31yearold man whose name was withheld to 
protect the victims identity assaulted the girl several times 
including once while he was free on bond awaiting sentencing on a 
charge of sexually assaulting her 
he pleaded guilty to two counts of sexually molesting his 
daughter state district judge frances maloney announced the 
sentence tuesday 
defense lawyers had asked that the man be placed on probation so 
that he could get psychological help but prosecutor lynne cartsunis 
had asked for the life term 
the sentence was completely appropriate for what he did to this 
child cartsunis said i hope it tells that child and other 
children that they will be protected from this kind of abuse 
the man who lost his job as a baggage handler for american 
airlines following his arrest last december had pleaded guilty last 
september to fondling the child four times between july and october 
1987 but he was allowed to remain free on bond while awaiting 
sentencing 
when authorities discovered that he had allegedly raped the girl 
in november maloney ordered him arrested and set his bond at 
500000 
the man testified monday that the attacks were a form of 
compassion that went the wrong way 
he agreed to plead guilty to the charges stemming from the 
attacks in 1987 and last november in a deal that prosecutors said 
would keep the child from having to testify against him the only 
issue during the trial was the length of his sentence

residents of this besieged city quietly 
bid good riddance to the soviet army today and said they hoped the 
completion of the withdrawal would lead to peace 
the russians are gone said a merchant in the citys old 
bazaar who identified himself as hasan now there will be peace 
he said as he tried to sell one of the few soviet fur hats left in 
the shopping district 
we are brothers another merchant said referring to the 
moslem guerrillas massed outside the capital we can solve our 
problems without foreigners the problems are just between afghans 
we dont need help from foreigners said the jewelry seller who 
gave only his first name ghulam 
as the merchants spoke the last soviet troops rolled home from 
afghanistan crossing a bridge at the border town of termez 
guerrilla leaders have predicted that with the red army gone 
major afghan cities held by the sovietbacked government of 
president najib would fall within weeks a loose coalition of 
guerrilla factions has been meeting in pakistan to coordinate their 
plans 
the completion of the soviet withdrawal was not announced on 
afghan national radio or television 
along the muddy narrow streets of the citys old bazaar today 
merchants wearing thick quilts against the bitter cold seemed more 
interested in bartering for their goods than discussing the soviets 
withdrawal 
the pullout from kabul was completed tuesday night when about 80 
red army troops at the citys airport filed twobytwo onto the four 
il76 military transport planes that would take them home 
a few afghan soldiers stationed at checkpoints around the airport 
watched the soviets departure for the first time in nine years 
the afghan army alone will have to defend the embattled capital 
against moslem guerrillas 
as the soviet pullout neared completion many foreign embassies 
closed 
the latest to withdraw its diplomats was poland which sent its 
four envoys home on tuesday hungary closed its embassy last week 
west germany the united states france italy britain and 
austria closed their missions earlier this month 
since midjanuary moscow has been airlifting up to 600 tons of 
flour fuel and other supplies into the capital to help ease 
shortages that have caused long lines at bakeries and gasoline 
stations refugees fleeing fighting in the rugged countryside have 
swelled kabuls population to 22 million 
the soviets had hoped to bring in 12000 tons of flour by today 
but red army soldiers said the goal had not been met partly due to 
heavy snows that closed the airport for several days 
th soviet union agreed to withdraw its troops from afghanstan 
under a unsponsored accord signed in geneva in april 
moscow sent the troops into afghanistan in december 1979 to back 
the marxist government in war with the moslem insurgents at the 
height of the soviet involvement there were an estimated 115000 
red army troops in afghanistan 
more than 1 million people including more than 15000 soviet 
soldiers have died in the fighting and about 5 millions of afghans 
fled to refugee camps in neighboring pakistan and iran

a vase worth 500000 and considered one of 
the bestknown pieces of ceramics in the world has been stolen from 
a museum here just days after a similar robbery in albany 150 miles 
away 
its the mona lisa of ceramics ronald kuchta art director 
of the everson museum said tuesday of the scarab vase made in 1910 
by potter adelaide alsop robineau of syracuse 
the theft at the everson was discovered just a few hours after 
kuchta distributed copies of a newspaper article about the theft of 
three small sculptures from the albany institute of history and art 
on saturday 
the scarab vase its value estimated at 500000 was apparently 
removed from the eversons falcone gallery between 730 am monday 
and 10 am tuesday while the museum was closed to the public 
kuchta said 
a thief removed four screws holding a plexiglass cover over the 
vase took the 17inchtall aquatinted work and substituted a less 
valuable copper vase 
this is staggering the vase is irreplaceable its one of the 
bestknown pieces of ceramics in the world probably the bestknown 
piece of ceramics in the united states kuchta said the vase was 
purchased by the everson in 1930 the year after robineaus death 
kuchta said he was unsure how the vase was removed without 
activating the eversons electronic security system or drawing the 
attention of museum guards 
the vase could not be easily stuffed under a coat because it is 
so delicate kuchta said 
everson has notified syracuse police the fbi and the 
international foundation for art research a new york organization 
that monitors art thefts 
the vase which is insured is so well known in art circles that 
there is virtually no chance it could be sold to a museum dealer or 
reputable art collector kuchta said

moslems in yorkshire wrote the latest chapter in 
the worlds long history of bookburning when they used a cigarette 
lighter to set fire to a copy of salman rushdies the satanic 
verses 
the moslems who mostly emigrated from pakistan to work in the 
textile mills of bradford say the novel blasphemes their islamic 
religion and demand that it be withdrawn 
their protestbyburning on tuesday night was seen on british 
tvs commercial channel 4 network 
the indianborn rushdie lives in london he says he takes very 
seriously indeed a call to moslems on tuesday by irans ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini to kill the author and publishers of the satanic 
verses 
violence over the novel has killed at least seven people in 
pakistan and india 
and so in further anger the book burning on tuesday night a 
practice at least as old as the great wall of china 
in 230 bc in china emperor shih huang ti who called himself 
the first emperor unified the country and constructed the great 
wall but he is chiefly remembered for burning books 
the emperor apparently believed the books of the past provided 
ammunition for his intellectual opponents so he had all the 
existing literature including the works of chinas greatest sage 
confucius gathered and committed to the flames 
exempted were some copies he preserved for the imperial library 
and books dealing with the occult medicine farming and 
treegrowing chinese scholars to this day still reproach him for 
his vandalism 
the emnperor commanded scholars to stop discussing the past and 
buried many of them alive when they protested 
the decameron by giovanni boccaccio one of the earliest 
works in italian and among the most famous books in all literature 
was publicly burned in florence more than a century after the author 
died in 1375 
a collection of moral and immoral tales it was ordered to the 
flames by girolama savonarola a priest who campaigned against 
corruption and immorality 
bonfires also consumed the works of francesco di petracco known 
as petrarch the italian humanist inaugurator of the renaissance in 
italy and a supreme poet of love 
savonarola himself was accused of heresy after he denounced pope 
alexander vi and was tortured hanged and burned at the stake in 
1498 
the roman catholic church in 1520 burned the writings of martin 
luther the german religious reformer and founder of protestanism 
luther retaliated by publicly consigning pope leo xs condemnation 
of himself to the flames together with a copy of the churchs laws 
john milton author of paradise lost and regarded as 
englands greatest poet after william shakespeare fared no better 
two of his works eikonklastes and defensio prima were 
gathered and burned in 1660 by order of the house of commons 
the works were written in defense of the commonwealth led by 
oliver cromwell whom milton enthusiastically supported 
the persecution of milton began with the restoration of the 
monarchy when king charles ii came to the throne but milton escaped 
the scaffold probably because he had friends at court like the poet 
andrew marvell 
another kind of bookburning took place in germany in 1817 at a 
time when student associations were agitating for german unity 
liberal students publicly burned the writings of conservatives whose 
ideas they opposed 
the most notorious bookburning of modern times was in germany in 
1933 the first year of adolf hitlers dictatorship 
the nazis began burning books by jewish writers by socialists 
and marxists in april less than three months after hitler became 
chancellor 
their bonfire was lit in front of the berlin opera house on may 
10 works by hundreds of writers which had been seized from 
libraries were burned in a huge pile 
among the authors were the germans playwright bertolt brecht 
novelists lion feuchtwanger brothers heinrich and thomas mann 
franz werfel who wrote the song of bernadette and cultural 
theorist walter benjamin austrian novelists arthur schnitzler and 
stefan zweig and czech novelist franz kafka 
alumni at dulwich college in london recall that some books by one 
of their famous old boys humorous english novelist pg wodehouse 
were burned by boys at the school after the writer agreed to 
broadcast for the germans during world war ii 
the writer was captured by the germans in france in 1940 and held 
in germany his broadcasts caused a scandal in britain and after the 
war he settled in the united states he died in 1975

hud secretary jack kemp taking a firsthand look 
at inner city problems said today he was committed to a vigorous 
effort to expand the housing stock both public and private 
kemp told a meeting of black atlanta leaders arranged by coretta 
scott king there are fiscal restraints i am going to be 
considerate ofbut were going to make a difference 
mrs king widow of the slain civil rights leader martin luther 
king jr said from everything weve heard you say we think you 
mean business if something happens and there is not a 
followthrough youre going to have a lot of disappointed people 
kemp said he hoped to expand affordable housing for lowincome 
people through both federal projects and incentives to encourage 
private development 
on tuesday kemp offered tax incentives and enterprise zones to 
fight distress and despair among the urban poor but made no 
promise to spend more on housing as he toured this citys poor 
sections 
areas that were at one time redlined for despair need to be 
greenlined for success kemp said tuesday referring to the 
practice by lenders of refusing to grant housing loans in 
neighborhoods they considered undesirable 
kemp was spending a second day today visiting atlantas poor 
neighborhoods on what he said was the first in a series of visits to 
troubled inner cities as the administrations new secretary of 
housing and urban development 
he was led on his tour by the citys black democratic leadership 
including mayor andrew young and rep john lewis on tuesday and 
today was being shown more troubled areas by coretta scott king 
wife of the late martin luther king jr he also met with community 
leaders and developers 
weve had a national recovery but folks have been left 
behind said the former pro football player congressman and 
unsuccessful republican presidential candidate 
there is distress and despair in many of those areas of the 
economy that have been left behind and thats where i definitely 
want to focus my attention he said 
kemp brought the leaders no pledges of more federal money for 
permanent housing which the nations mayors have said is needed to 
fight homelessness but he said he would push for dramatic 
incentives to attract business investment into inner cities and 
consider other innovative public and private inducements to bring 
jobs and housing to blighted areas 
he said he would seek enactment of specific tax incentives 
including breaks on capital gains to create the urban enterprise 
zones in troubled inner cities the tax breaks would be contingent 
on the businesses hiring people who otherwise would be on welfare 
rolls 
congress has passed enterprise zone legislation but without the 
tax incentives president bushs 1990 budget proposal includes such 
tax incentives 
some of the redeveloped projects kemp visited were accomplished 
with local versions of that abatements in property taxes 
weve got to do it at the federal level because only the 
federal government can provide dramatic incentives he said 
kemp was warmly greeted and met bipartisan encouragement 
although several local leaders suggested there were needs that 
exceeded the ability of enterprise zones 
eugene bowens president of interfaith inc a church group said 
that around the country many 15 to 30year agreements with owners 
of existing subsidized rental housing are due to expire soon as a 
result the units could no longer be available to lowincome people 
that is a big problem and its going to be happening on my 
watch kemp said adding that he wants to find ways to 
reincentivize both taxes and housing

business inventories rose 09 percent in 
december the biggest increase since october and sales jumped 08 
percent for the fastest gain since august the government reported 
today 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots rose to a seasonally adjusted 7606 billion while sales 
reached 5082 billion 
decembers 09 percent boost in inventories followed a 04 
percent increase in november it was the 24th straight month in 
which inventories had risen 
the 08 percent increase in sales followed a 04 percent sales 
rise for november as the rates of increase for inventories and 
sales closely tracked one another 
the similar increases in december produced no change in the ratio 
of inventories to sales which stood at 150 meaning it would take 
15 months to exhaust inventories at the december sales pace 
if not accompanied by rising sales increasing inventories can 
signal economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to 
order production cuts and layoffs while they sell off reserve goods 
decembers sales gain was the biggest since a 13 percent 
increase in october it was pinned to a 24 percent increase at the 
manufacturing level which offset a 08 drop in sales by wholesalers 
and a 01 drop in retail sales during the crucial holiday shopping 
season 
the government on tuesday reported that retail sales in january 
jumped a healthy 06 percent after the disappointing yearend 
performance 
decembers increase in inventories was the biggest since a 11 
percent jump in august it was led by a 15 increase at the retail 
level due to the yearend sales slowdown while manufacturer 
inventories climbed 07 percent and wholesale inventories rose 06 
percent

police closed an avantgarde art exhibit today 
after a newspaper received a letter saying bombs would be placed in 
the gallery if the show continued 
it was the second time the exhibit has been closed 
police and several organizers searched the china art gallery for 
signs of a bomb as of this afternoon nothing had been found 
the beijing daily received a letter tuesday saying three bombs 
would be planted in the gallery if the show was not shut the letter 
was composed with chinese characters cut from a newspaper and pasted 
on a piece of paper organizers said 
organizers said they suspected an artist who was not picked to 
take part in the show was behind the threat 
it seems to be another kind of performance art said one 
organizer we think the artist is trying to show arts 
relationship with chinese society 
police closed the show the day it opened feb 5 when a woman 
shot her sculpture with a bb gun in defiance of a ban on performance 
art the artist and her boyfriend were detained for three days and 
then released 
other artists also defied the action art ban by tossing 
condoms and change on the floor and sitting on eggs 
the show reopened friday 
organizers said although they did not approve of the bomb threat 
they believed it could benefit modern art in china 
through this activity we will get much publicity said one 
organizer at this stage in its development chinese modern art 
needs all the publicity it can get 
the show is the largest avantgarde show in chinas history 
filling five halls of the china art gallery with more than 250 works 
many of the works are controversial some like a huge balloon 
shaped as a breast are explicitly sexual others like a portrait 
on graph paper of the late leader mao tsetung are political 
other pieces such as a dozen dead fish wrapped in plastic are 
just strange 
for decades art in china was controlled by the state and works 
that did not serve the communist party were not welcome recently 
the state has allowed more freedom in art

salman rushdies novel the satanic verses is 
filled with references to the islamic faith founded by mohammed 
moslems revere mohammed as the prophet who brought allahs 
revelations in the koran the holy book of islam 
three main characters in the book are mahound the prophet of a 
city of sand called jahilia and recipient of a revelation in which 
satanic verses mingle with divine an indian movie star gibreel 
farishta and saladin chamcha 
as the book opens farishta and chamcha are passengers on a 
hijacked jetliner the plane blows up they fall clinging to each 
other singing rival songs gibreel becomes the archangel gabriel 
although rushdie continues to call him gibreel and chamcha the 
devil 
locked into conflict their identities blur 
in one passage gibreel sees god 
gibreels vision of the supreme being was not abstract in the 
least he saw sitting on the bed a man of about the same age as 
himself of medium height fairly heavily built with 
saltandpepper beard cropped close to the line of the jaw what 
struck him most was that the apparition was balding seemed to 
suffer from dandruff and wore glasses this was not the almighty he 
had expected who are you he asked with interest 
ooparvala the apparition answered the fellow upstairs 
how do i know youre not the other one gibreel asked 
craftily neechayvala the guy from underneath 
another passage is set in a brothel called the curtain where 
prostitutes adopt the names of some of mohammeds 12 wives 
including ayesha and hafsah 
it was during one of these playful sessions at the end of a 
working day when the girls were alone with their eunuchs and their 
wine that baal heard the youngest talking about her client the 
grocer musa that one she said hes got a bee in his bonnet 
about the prophets wives hes so annoyed about them that he gets 
excited just by mentioning their names he tells me that i 
personally am the spitting image of ayesha herself and shes his 
nibs favorite as all are aware so there 
when the news got around jahilia that the whores of the curtain 
had each assumed the identity of one of mahounds wives the 
clandestine excitement of the citys males was intense 
charles eaton a british scholar and convert to islam told the 
guardian newspaper this is one of the most offensive passages to 
moslems the equivalent offense to presenting the virgin mary as 
a whore 
salman rushdie who was brought up in islam knows exactly 
where to put the needle in said eaton also known as hasan 
abdulhakim western readers very often dont see this 
another passage tells of the persian scribe salman who takes 
dictation from the prophet and begins to add his own inventions 
little things at first if mahound recited a verse in which god 
was described as allhearing allknowing i would write all 
knowing allwise heres the point mahound did not notice the 
alterations so there i was actually writing the book or 
rewriting anyway polluting the word of god with my own profane 
language but good heavens if my poor words could not be 
distinguished from the revelation by gods own messenger then what 
did that mean what did that say about the quality of the divine 
poetry look i swear i was shaken to my soul 
its one thing to be a smart bastard and have halfsuspicions 
about funny business but its quite another thing to find out that 
youre right listen i changed my life for that man i left my 
country crossed the world settled among people who thought me a 
slimy foreign coward for saving their who never appreciated what i 
but never mind that the truth is that what i expected when i made 
that first tiny change allwise instead of allhearing what i 
wanted was to read it back to the prophet and hed say whats 
the matter with you salman are you going deaf and id say oops 
o god bit of a slip how could i and correct myself but it didnt 
happen and now i was writing the revelation and nobody was 
noticing and i didnt have the courage to own up i was scared 
silly i can tell you also i was sadder than i have ever been

st cloud minn times on john tower as defense secretary 
the first vote on john towers nomination as secretary of defense 
has been put on hold for two weeks while the fbi reviews new 
allegations about his finances and excessive drinking 
tower has vowed to stick with the fight for senate confirmation 
thats a mistake he should withdraw and allow president bush to 
submit another nomination 
many of the allegations against tower may well prove to be 
unfounded but there have been enough serious questions about his 
character that it is doubtful that he could function effectively in 
one of the nations most vital cabinet positions 
tower has not been convicted of any misdeeds but questions about 
his personal life and hints and allegations of conflicts of interest 
have not subsided if anything they grow as time passes 
the result is a dangerous void in one of the nations most 
important leadership roles even if he survives confirmation 
lingering doubts will impair his ability to lead for many months at 
best

the milwaukee journal on congressional pay raises 
congressional leaders having taken a beating in the recent 
payraise controversy seem to have concluded that their present 
method is doomed 
adopted 22 years ago the plan was supposed to spare lawmakers 
direct responsibility for setting their own pay a bipartisan 
commission would recommend salary increases if deemed appropriate 
once every four years subject to paring by the president and 
passive acceptance by congress 
as it turned out however lawmakers did not get credit for 
letting someone else decide what their pay should be 
far from it they were accused in various quarters of cowardice 
and subterfuge for not having the guts to vote on their own 
salaries 
the senate and house working with the president need to search 
for an alternative 
we believe the method wisconsin uses is part of the answer 
technically at least the lawmakers in wisconsin do not give 
themselves a raise voters have the opportunity to throw them out of 
office before the salary increase takes effect

the westerly ri sun on mob justice 
what happened to a mugger who got caught in brooklyns closeknit 
williamsburg section tells us again that when people take the 
law into their own hands the consequences may also be criminal 
a man who held up another at knifepoint and slashed his face 
when he resisted was chased by a crowd of some 50 people and beaten 
unconscious 
should a mob even wellmotivated against crime have meted 
out this rough justice 
this society long ago established the principle that it is 
the function of the police to apprehend suspects and of the courts 
to determine their guilt or innocence 
that angry crowd should have grabbed him and held him for the 
police that in sum is what the rule of law is all about

the arizona republic phoenix ariz on drug tests of nuclear 
plant employees 
the nuclear regulatory commission is headed in the right 
direction with its move toward a rule requiring random drug and 
alcohol testing of employees at all us nuclear power plants 
given the risks and the magnitude of mishaps it is frightening 
to think that workers at such critical jobs would not be closely 
monitored and certainly the monitoring should include regular 
checks for evidence of substance abuse 
implementation of the proposed regulation which would apply to 
all utilities operating or building atomic power stations hinges on 
final approval by the nrc which is expected to rule in about a 
month and official publication of the rule which could take an 
additional month 
the possibility more likely a probability also exists of a 
timeconsuming legal challenge 
the federal governments plans for random drug testing seldom go 
unchallenged by civil libertarians and that is fine provided the 
courts do not lose sight of the public safety

the charleston wva gazette on affirmative action 
predictions that president reagans appointees to the us 
supreme court would undercut affirmative action proved partly 
correct last month 
in its ruling on a richmond virginia case the court slightly 
curtailed this discrimination remedy and perhaps opened the door to 
future assaults 
the richmond city council had set aside 30 percent of all 
municipal contracts for minority firms 
the high court scuttled the richmond law decreeing that state 
and local governments cant establish setasides without first 
proving past discrimination and their predecessors responsibility 
for it a tough task 
further the city or state cannot establish quotas or goals 
writing for the majority justice sandra day oconnor warned that 
setasides will be subject to strict scrutiny 
justice thurgood marshall in a biting dissent said the 
court is constitutionalizing its wishful thinking which assumes 
that racial equality has been achieved in america 
thats not so until it is affirmative action will continue to 
be unequal but necessary

an unusual winter deluge that left three people dead in tennessee 
and kentucky raised the threat of more flooding from indiana to 
texas today as hot southern air met cold northern air with dangerous 
results 
the relentless rain filled rivers to overflowing closed roads 
and forced the evacuation of a hospital although it brought relief 
to droughtstricken areas of tennessee and texas for many people it 
was too much of a good thing 
there have been very few floods people can remember worse than 
this sen albert gore jr dtenn said tuesday night as he 
toured hardhit sections not far from his home in carthage 
wilson county just east of nashville was drenched with nearly 6 
inches of rain one woman 62yearold sophia payer drowned when 
she ignored police warnings not to cross flooded us highway 231 
authorities said 
the rainfall also caused a power outage in the county that forced 
70 people to be evacuated from a hospital in lebanon schools were 
canceled and police reported 80 vehicles stalled on flooded roads 
thirty people in cheatham county northeast of nashville were 
evacuated early today when the harpeth river overflowed its banks 
and flooded 10 homes said danny newton chief of operations for the 
tennessee emergency management agency 
rivers overflowed in central and western kentucky frankfort the 
state capital was under a flood warning today as the kentucky river 
exceeded flood stage the state division of disaster and emergency 
services reported the river was at 3179 feet at 8 am and rising a 
foot an hour flood stage is 31 feet 
residents were evacuated along the green river and little river 
and merchants in new haven in central kentucky continued sandbagging 
the banks of the rolling fork of the salt river 
schools were closed today in at least 16 counties plus frankfort 
the western kentucky parkway a major eastwest artery was closed 
between leitchfield and elizabethtown due to high water 
many other rivers in kentucky tennessee and indiana are expected 
to flood later in the week as their water levels continue to rise 
flash flood watches were in effect early today from northeast 
texas to southern ohio ranging along a line that crossed through 
arkansas tennessee kentucky illinois indiana and west virginia 
the ground is pretty well saturated national weather service 
meteorologist bob watson said in paducah ky which received more 
than half a foot of rain between midnight sunday and late tuesday 
a nun sister robert edlin of the sisters of loretto was caught 
in high water as she drove along kentucky 605 about 30 miles 
southeast of louisville authorities said she was rescued as the 
water reached the depth of her dashboard she was treated at 
hospital in bardstown for minor hypothermia 
two people in kentucky died monday when their car went out of 
control in heavy rain near the indiana border 
forecasters in tennessee said the downpour should end a drought 
that has lingered for four years nashvilles rainfall for the year 
is approaching 9 inches 3 above normal the 419 inches it received 
tuesday marked the most rain in a 12hour period during the past 10 
years weather officials said 
in west texas the storm brought rain to areas that had seen few 
drops since last august 
in western mitchell county east of big spring there were 
reports of up to 2 inches of rain tuesday night up to 1 inches 
was measured in the garden city area between san angelo and midland 
there are still some pretty fair chances of getting more 
moisture said jim boyd of the national weather service in san 
angelo texas in predicting that the weather system would remain in 
the area another 36 to 48 hours 
nonetheless meteorologists said it wasnt enough to end a 
drought that has plagued ranchers and caused dust storms 
its not going to be any better this spring warned barry 
lambert of the national weather service just wait until march 
when the wind begins blowing 
officials speculated tuesday that the weather may have 
contributed to mondays crash of a helicopter ambulance near tyler 
texas the pilot and two nurses died after the copter struck a power 
line during a storm 
the heavy rains were caused by the meeting of three weather 
fronts one carrying warm wet air northeast from baja california 
one carrying warm tropical air north from the gulf of mexico and one 
keeping a band of cold air in place across much of the northcentral 
portions of the united states 
its more typical of an early spring situation said dan 
mccarthy meteorologist with the national weather services severe 
storms forecast center in kansas city mo 
does that mean spring will be early it doesnt mean anything 
like that he said 
in fact mccarthy said another frigid blast of arctic air is 
heading south and should lower temperatures in the northern plains 
to highs of around zero by the weekend

the miami herald on bushs address to congress 
the tone was kindler and gentler but the underlying economic 
message of president bushs budget address to congress feb 9 was 
the familiar supplyside voodoo 
those facts likely mean that the rhetoric between the white house 
and the capitol will be softer than in recent years but the 
prospect for stalemate is as strong as ever 
the voodoo comes in the fact that bush hopes to keep his 
notaxes pledge by simply projecting a whopping 80 billion growth 
in federal revenues from exisitng sources 
given the 150 billion deficit in foreign trade the 100 billion 
emergency in the savings and loan industry the festering wound of 
unpayable debts owed by latin america to us banks and early signs 
of creeping inflation that projection looks wildly optimistic

the meridian miss star on higher taxes 
house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill 
is a true democrat he wants higher taxes 
congressman rostenkowski said sunday that president bush should 
look to gasoline tobacco and alcohol as possible vehicles for 
higher taxation as congress begins work on the governments 198990 
budget 
never mind that the president both in his 1988 campaign for 
election and since taking office has vowed that he will not go 
along with new taxation 
never mind either that bush already has presented the 
congress with a plan showing how the new budget can be funded 
without new taxes 
despite the voter mandate the democratic partys prescription 
for government financing has not changed one iota it is to 
taxandtax spendandspend so far as it is concerned there 
apparently is no limit

the hudson dispatch union city nj on fbi bungling of a 
kidnap case 
somebody needs to say it irving flax probably would be alive 
today if it werent for the fbis handling of the new jersey case 
the kidnapped warehouse supervisor was alive when his wife paid a 
25000 ransom late last month within four hours the 58yearold 
was killed executionstyle 
the fbis first mistake was failure to notify paramus police of 
the imminent pickup of the ransom money at a borough diner clearly 
a dangerous situation and the fbi obviously could have benefitted 
from the help and expertise 
after the pickup fbi agents could have arrested the kidnapper 
incredibly they passed up the chance then lost the car 
the suspect in the case john m martini sr was apprehended not 
by the fbi but by fort lee police 
arrogantly the fbi which could be called the federal bureau of 
ineptitude for its actions works in a vacuum assuming a false 
superiority and slighting local law enforcement agencies 
fbi agents have bungled dangerous situations and heightened 
potential danger to the public

the joplin mo globe on bill white as national league president 
it seems fitting the search committee that selected bill white a 
black man as the national leagues next president was headed by 
peter omalley owner of the los angeles dodgers 
for it was a former dodgers official al campanis who stood the 
game on its ear with his remark that blacks could never attain top 
positions in baseball because they were unequipped for management 
the decision to choose white should help silence the 
criticism that baseball has refused to extend to minorities the 
opportunities for top executive positions 
talent is the key to the selection the owners didnt choose 
someone as head of the national league just because he was black 
rather the choice was predicated on the ability of the man to 
handle the high responsibility of the task 
in short bill white fills the job description of national league 
president nicely thank you and is what the game needs

portland maine press herald on wrestling as entertainment not 
sport 
professional wrestling it turns out is just an 
entertainment and not a dangerous sport at all the admission 
comes from no less than the world wrestling federation 
talk about a drop kick in the abdominal area 
its near impossible to believe you mean those terrifying 
choke holds those vicious body slams those flying body presses 
launched from the top of the ropes are all just fun and games 
apparently the wwf concedes as much in legislation it is 
supporting in new jersey in order to win exemption from regulations 
that apply to boxing and other sports that can cause serious 
physical injuries 
it wants professional wrestling defined as an activity in which 
participants struggle handinhand primarily for the purpose of 
providing entertainment to spectators rather than conducting a bona 
fide athletic contest

president bush hitting the road to drum up 
support for his new budget proposal pledged today to work with 
congress on spending cuts and said we werent sent to washington 
to sit on our hands 
although members of congress are pressing him for detail on where 
he wants to make some 10 billion in proposed cuts bush deferred 
that decision to future negotiations between his administration and 
capital hill 
and in a speech to a joint session of the south carolina 
legislature that was interrupted by applause several times bush 
said he has no intention of sitting by and allowing cuts to be made 
across the board under provisions of the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law 
i am prepared to work with the congress to make those hard 
choices the president said we werent sent to washington to 
sit on our hands either to pass the cost of indecision on to 
working americans by raising their taxes or to fail to reduce the 
deficit which will cause the cuts to be done automatically under 
the law 
bush boasted that no one had termed his budget proposal that he 
delivered last week to congress doa or dead on arrival leaders 
of the democraticcontrolled congress often used that term to 
describe the budgets that former president reagan submitted in the 
latter years of his administration 
if anyone wants to use the term doa now bush said he has 
his own interpretation of the acronym defining opportunity for 
americans 
the president said his budget analysts have figured that with no 
new taxes the government will take in an extra 80 billion in 
revenues just due to economic growth 
that figure is more conservative he said than the projection of 
the congressional budget office which he quoted at 86 billion 
whichever number is used bush said thats enough money to 
reduce the deficit down to the levels required by 
grammrudmanhollings and to spend more money on priority programs 
the president had lunch at the residence of republican gov 
carroll campbell a longtime friend and political backer before his 
flight back to washington in early afternoon 
bush and chief of staff john sununu sat at the ends of an oblong 
table at the luncheon attended by about 15 people 
for the second of his outoftown budget speeches bush chose 
another state that played a major role in his election victory last 
year after visiting new hampshire on monday 
bush won the south carolina republican presidential primary last 
march 5 that victory which followed his win in new hampshire 
catapulted him toward the nearsweep of the super tuesday primaries 
and caucuses on march 8 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said tuesday that 
bush was not attempting in his outoftown trips to circumvent 
congress and put pressure on washingtons lawmakers to support his 
budget policies as reagan often had done 
bush has come under criticism among some democratic quarters on 
capitol hill with some lawmakers complaining that his proposed 
budget allows him to claim credit for proposing more spending on 
social problems while making sure that congress shares 
responsibility for coming up with unpopular cuts in other programs 
fitzwater acknowledged that the administration has not offered a 
separate proposal for filling a 96 billion to 11 billion gap in 
the amount of money available to finance bushs spending initiatives 
in areas such as help for the homeless education and child care 
bush generally has called for freezing most domestic programs at 
1989 levels that would leave the 96 billion to 11 billion 
financing gap in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 if the programs 
are merely allowed to keep pace with inflation and population growth 
sen robert c byrd dwva chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee and sen jim sasser dtenn head of the 
senate budget committee told bush in a letter tuesday that if he 
failed to provide more detail on areas that will need to be cut 
congress would have no alternative but to assume that he 
endorses the reductions that reagan proposed last month 
bush budget director richard darman talking to reporters after a 
meeting tuesday with congressional budget leaders said the 
administration was making an extraordinary effort to achieve a 
budget consensus with congress 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said the white house appeared cooperative he said he 
hoped the administration would in meetings scheduled later this 
week provide congress with more information 
sununu the white house chief of staff said its not a 
question as to whether the detail is available its a question of 
whether you do it a step at a time

human rights campaigner andrei d sakharov said in 
a letter published wednesday he is withdrawing from the race for a 
territorial seat in a new national legislature 
sakharovs letter published in the weekly moscow news said he 
would not accept nominations from territorial districts because he 
believes he should represent the academy of sciences 
the prestigious academy where sakharov works as a nuclear 
physicist last month rejected proposals to throw his hat in the 
ring as its representative in the new 2250seat congress of 
peoples deputies the 67yearold dean of the soviet human rights 
movement was nominated to represent a moscow district but many of 
his scientific colleagues wanted him to represent them in the new 
congress 
sakharov who won the 1975 nobel peace prize said he agreed 
i feel that i am inseparably linked with the academy of which 
i have been a member 35 years sakharov wrote i have come to 
the conclusion that i should be a candidate namely of the academy in 
the new elections or not be one at all therefore i am taking the 
decision not to run anywhere except the academy of sciences of the 
ussr withdrawing my consent to run from all territorial and 
nationalterritorial districts which fielded my candidacy 
in a letter accompanying sakharovs in moscow news space 
scientist roald sagdeyev said he supports his colleagues decision 
and hopes the academy leadership will reverse its decision and 
find a way to nominate sakharov sagdeyev was also passed over 
as an academy nominee 
sakharov is visiting canada where he has given conflicting 
signals about whether he will continue to seek a congress of 
peoples deputies seat on sunday he told reporters in ottawa i 
dont reject the idea that i will still be a candidate in the 
election 
more than 1000 academy of sciences workers rallied feb 2 to 
protest the organizations rejection of the candidacies of sagdeyev 
sakharov and several other prominent intellectuals the protesters 
charged that the academy leadership failed to listen to the popular 
will in rejecting the nominations

top government and communist party leaders paid 
lavish tribute wednesday to the late panchen lama who used his 
influence as tibetan buddhisms no 2 leader to support chinese rule 
in tibet 
party general secretary zhao ziyang premier li peng and other 
top officials stood with bowed heads in front of a portrait of the 
panchen lama capping the official transformation of him in death 
into a national hero and symbol of ethnic unity 
the panchen lama took a clearcut stand of patriotism for 
decades particularly in the fight against the separatists on the 
tibetan issue vice president wan li said in eulogy to about 1000 
government and religious leaders at the great hall of the people 
it is rare for a dead official even one of high rank to be 
honored with such a lavish memorial at the great hall 
the panchen lama died jan 28 at age 50 of a heart attack he was 
a vice chairman of the national peoples congress chinas 
legislature as well as the highestranking tibetan buddhist monk in 
china the dalai lama the faiths top leader has lived in exile in 
india since a failed 1959 tibetan revolt against china 
his death means the loss of a great patriot and statesman to 
our country a devoted friend to our party and an outstanding 
patriotic religious leader to the tibetan people the official 
xinhua news agency quoted wan as saying 
the memorial parts of which were shown on tv was closed to 
foreign reporters reporters also have been barred from attending 
ongoing mourning services for the panchen lama in tibet 
tibetan officials tightly restrict foreigners access to tibet 
for fear they will witness demonstrations of antichinese sentiment 
periodically reported by travelers 
after nearly 40 years of communist rule in tibet china remains 
in tenuous control of the tibetan people despite a heavy military 
presence revolts have broken out sporadically three largescale 
protests and many smaller ones have been held in the capital lhasa 
in the past 1 years 
many tibetans argue that they have their own language culture 
and religion and wish to be left alone 
the panchen lama by virtue of his religious role was the only 
tibetan who supported chinese rule and still held the respect of the 
people he was regarded as the 10th incarnation of the buddhist god 
amitabha 
his death leaves the government without a credible foil to the 
dalai lama who has sharply criticized the chinese for human rights 
abuses in tibet 
the only other tibetan with a high post in the chinese government 
is ngapoi ngawang jigme 78 also a congress vice chairman he was 
an aristocrat and official in the precommunist tibetan government 
who declared allegiance to the chinese soon after their troops 
entered tibet in 1950 he has no strong following among tibetans 
although he has opposed calls for tibetan independence the 
panchen lama spoke out several times against what he considered 
harsh treatment of his people in one of his last speeches he said 
tibetans had paid too high a price for their development under 
chinese rule and that communist mistakes outnumbered their 
successes in tibet 
the comments were reported in the official media at the time but 
have not been mentioned since his death instead the panchen lama 
has been turned into a symbol of loyalty to the chinese motherland 
the party newspaper the peoples daily carried a fullpage 
tribute to him wednesday referring to him as the great panchen 
the government has indicated it will allow religious officials to 
carry out the traditional method of selecting a new panchen lama by 
identifying his reincarnation in a child however it has said the 
choice must be approved by the government 
tibetan officials have refused to say if the process has begun

more than 1000 central americans formed a 
halfmilelong line today outside a rural immigration and 
naturalization service detention center opened after the ins was 
evicted from its offices 
it was their first chance to file for political amnesty since the 
ins processing center in harlingen was closed friday because of 
alleged health and fire code violations 
this tremendous line here represents a large number of central 
americans flooding into the rio grande valley and we just cant 
continue like this said omer g sewell the ins district director 
in harlingen while walking the length of the line of immigrants 
ins officials at about 10 am began moving the refugees on to 
the grounds of the minimumsecurity port isabel detention center 
which holds 425 aliens most of them awaiting deportation 
im fleeing from military service said henry torres a 
27yearold nicaraguan as he waited in line a communist country 
is no good 
torres was one of several hundred people who camped overnight 
just outside the entrance to the detention center near the community 
of bayview 25 miles southeast of harlingen by midmorning hundreds 
more had joined the line 
taxis vans and cars carried many of the immigrants to the rural 
center avoiding some of the traffic congestion that had led to 
complaints about the processing site at a former furniture store in 
harlingen

president bush said wednesday his new 
budget plan will force congress and the white house to make hard 
choices on spending cuts so that more money can be targeted for 
social programs the environment educaton and the space program 
but bush speaking to the south carolina legislature did not 
offer any suggestions about where to reduce spending democrats 
complain that bush is taking credit for raising spending for 
domestic programs while making congress share responsibility for 
unpopular cuts 
bush flew here as part of a series of appearances around the 
country to extol the 116 trillion budget he unveiled last week 
the president will travel to st louis on friday for a speech and 
lunch with students at washington university 
the expanded social programs proposed in bushs budget would have 
to be offset by up to 11 billion in spending reductions to keep the 
deficit down 
bush got a friendly reception from the democraticcontrolled 
legislature speaking in the cavernous whitebrick house chamber 
the president said 
i speak to you in the spirit of bipartisanship ive got to 
youve got us outnumbered 
bush made a pitch for his proposed reduction in the capital gains 
tax to a maximum of 15 percent now capital gains are taxed as 
ordinary income 
the president said that change would spur investment and produce 
more tax revenues while at the same time making america more 
competitive in international markets 
all of our biggest trading partners including japan and west 
germany tax longterm capital gains modestly if at all bush said 
pledging anew not to raise taxes bush said that reducing the 
deficit means the government will have to make tough choices 
my budget is a realistic plan that does more for education 
more for the environment and more for the space program he said 
moreover he said it would increase spending for head start the war 
against drugs child care and other social programs 
bush said that projected economic growth would result in up to 
80 billion in additional tax revenue 
but spending more on priority programs he said would 
require that savings be found elsewhere in the budget 
and i am prepared to work with the congress to make those hard 
choices bush said 
we werent sent to washington any of us up there to sit on 
our hands either to pass the cost of indecision onto working 
americans by raising their taxes or to fail to reduce the deficit 
which will cause the cuts to be done automatically under the law 
the president said 
faced with a congress controlled by democrats bush said i 
will seek to work with the house and the senate not as members 
of competing political parties but as cooperating public servants 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bushs budget 
chief richard darman would meet during the day with congressional 
staff people to discuss bushs budget proposal 
details are being exchanged all the time fitzwater said 
darman goes up there with an armload of books and numbers so 
therell be detail 
fitzwater acknowledged tuesday that the administration had not 
offered a separate proposal for filling a 96 billion to 11 
billion gap in the amount of money available to finance bushs 
domestic spending initiatives 
sen robert c byrd dwva chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee and sen jim sasser dtenn head of the 
senate budget committee told bush in a letter that if he failed to 
provide more detail on areas that will need to be cut congress 
would have no alternative but to assume that he endorses the 
reductions that reagan proposed last month

intel corp has developed a supercomputer on a 
chip that will be offered as the basis for a new line of 
highspeed computers a senior intel executive disclosed today 
intels n10 chip is the main source of excitement at the 
integrated solid state circuits conference in new york the biggest 
research meeting of the year for the world semiconductor industry 
intel was not permitted to discuss the commercial uses of the new 
chip in its technical presentation today but in an interview 
afterward intel senior vice president david house said the company 
sees the n10 as the basis for a major new line of computers 
some analysts had predicted the intel chip would be offered only 
as a helper chip to intels main microprocessors such as the 80386 
and forthcoming 80486 that are the brains of personal computers 
but house said the chip also would be offered as the main 
processor in engineering and graphics workstations and 
multiprocessing computers other companies with intels help 
could build computers around the n10 house said 
an announcement of the availability of the n10 is expected by 
the end of the month probably at a feb 27 news conference in san 
francisco 
analysts have said intels chip could be a fearsome competitor to 
speedy processor chips from sun microsystems inc motorola inc and 
mips computer systems inc 
unlike those chips intels chip can handle instructions that 
have a word length of 64 bits twice as long as the 32 bits used 
in competing chips 
the 64bit word length is what entitles intel to call the n10 a 
supercomputer on a chip because mainframes and supercomputers also 
use 64bit words 
this is the first microprocessor product when it is formally 
introduced which will be a true mainframe computer james i 
magid a senior adviser to the securities firm needham amp co said 
in an interview 
the n10 is a major event its had a lot of excitement built 
up around it and it does appear to be the highestperformance 
processor soon to be available michael slater editor of 
microprocessor report newsletter said tuesday in advance of the 
presentation 
as a helper chip the n10 could handle the grunt work of 
highspeed repetitive calculations while a computers main 
processor handled more complex tasks said dean mccarron a 
microprocessor expert at instat inc in scottsdale ariz 
it probably would take a personal computer equipped with the n10 
and intels forthcoming 80486 microprocessor a few seconds to 
recalculate a long electronic spreadsheet instead of the minute it 
would take on todays fastest pcs mccarron said 
the n10 is built with socalled risc technology for reduced 
instruction set computing so it could not be used as a replacement 
for the microprocessors used in industrystandard personal computers 
until today intels only public statement on the n10 was a 
brief abstract of its paper in which it said the chip has a peak 
speed of 150 million operations a second that is five times faster 
than risc chips designed by motorola and japans fujitsu ltd 
aside from the intel chip researchers also are expecting 
announcements from digital equipment corp and hewlettpackard co 
of new generations of microprocessors according to mark horowitz a 
stanford university chip expert

for the 67th year children in this little 
town will celebrate george washingtons birthday with a hatchet hunt 
the tradition is aimed at reminding youngsters of the little 
lessons in the story of young washington admitting to his father 
that he chopped down the cherry tree said joseph hawkins director 
of the local ymca said wednesday 
the hunt in this town of 10000 sends about 300 youngsters 
ranging from preschoolers to teenagers scrambling through the 
woods for two engraved hatchets and two dozen other prizes such as 
fishing tackle and portable radios 
finders get to keep the hatchets the grand prizes are quite 
capable of taking down a cherry tree but no injuries have been 
reported and no one has suggested a break with the tradition 
hawkins said 
the parents have always gone along with it he said but of 
course after 67 years we now have a lot of the parents that took 
part in the hunt when they were kids 
hawkins said there have been instances when some participants 
didnt take the lesson of honesty to heart 
weve had some kids that tried to get into the woods early 
said hawkins but the fire department monitors the situation and 
when we find them we take the kids down to the police station where 
they get a little talk warning them about doing those sort of 
things 
the search is sponsored by the ymca and the fire department 
washingtons birthday is celebrated on monday

a taiwanese fighter pilot whose jet crashed in 
china has requested asylum from beijing and he denied reports he 
was carrying military secrets 
lt col lin xianshun told a news conference in canton that he 
wanted to be a pilot in the air force of the peoples liberation 
army 
i am proud to be a chinese lin said appearing on hong kong 
tv wednesday night i have studied the history and geography of 
the motherland since grade school i think coming back is better 
for myself 
the defection is the first since china announced in september it 
would abolish rewards for defecting military personnel 
lin 35 met with reporters from china hong kong and taiwan at 
the pearl river guest house in canton capital of the southeastern 
province of guangdong 
chinas air force had held lin incommunicado since saturday when 
the crash occurred in fengshun county about 180 miles north of 
canton 
lin parachuted to safety after his f5e fighter ran out of oil in 
heavy fog saturday he had flown from chihhang air base in taiwan 
lin who suffered minor injuries from his jump said he decided 
about a month ago to defect to china because he wanted to return to 
the ancestral home of his fathers family meixian county in 
northern guangdong 
lin said planned his escape for the spring festival holidays 
because he thought his fellow air force officers would not be at 
their most vigilant 
he said he did not believe that his family in taiwan would suffer 
because of his action and said he would like to call them from china 
lin denied reports in the taiwanese press he had brought 
taiwanese military secrets to china he said he only had things 
absolutely necessary for flying 
lin declined to comment on a taiwanese government statement he 
suffered from an emotional imbalance due to problems with his 
marriage he denied a government report that he had sinus problems 
which prevented him from flying 
in taiwan the defense ministry said lin flew to china because of 
fears that he soon would be grounded permanently and because of 
serious family problems 
the statement said lin had been expelled from the military and a 
warrant issued for his arrest it also said the commander of the 
chihhang air base and other responsible officers had either been 
transferred or received other penalties it said that lin did not 
carry confidential reports to china 
chinese reporters said air force officials have yet to decide 
whether to allow lin to join chinas military 
reports on the defection have been muted in the chinese press 
which usually employs such incidents as a propaganda tool against 
taiwan the staterun tv news did not report on lins news 
conference 
more than a dozen nationalist air force officers have sought 
asylum in china since 1949 when the nationalists fled to taiwan 
after losing a civil war to communist forces on the mainland 
military officials in taiwan said 19 military personnel have 
defected from china to taiwan since 1949 all of the 19 defected in 
planes 13 flying to south korea 
taiwan still offers rewards for chinese military defectors but 
they reduced them when china stopped its rewards

discovery of small quantities of illegal drugs 
will no longer be sufficient reason for federal agents to seize 
commercial fishing vessels at sea according to a change in the 
governments zero tolerance policy 
coast guard adm paul yost and customs service commissioner 
william von raab are issuing interim guidelines expected to be 
announced thursday to conform with a congressional mandate that was 
included in antidrug legislation signed into law in november coast 
guard and customs officials said 
under the policy that began last march federal agents were free 
to seize vessels within 12 miles of the us coastline if any amount 
of illegal drugs was found on board 
recreational boat owners were furious complaining that they 
could face the loss of millions of dollars worth of property if a 
crew member or guest possessed a trace of marijuana without the boat 
owners knowledge and commercial fishermen said they could lose 
their livelihoods even if they were eventually found innocent and 
their vessels were returned 
late last year congress narrowly approved zero tolerance 
modifications that would in the words of rep don young ralaska 
prevent innocent owners of fishing vessels from being persecuted 
by wellmeaning but overexcited enforcement agents 
congress instructed the executive branch to issue new regulations 
within 60 days and then hold a 30day public comment period but the 
bush administration already is a month late and customs service 
officials said they do not expect formal regulations to be proposed 
for at least several weeks 
but yost and von raab in a joint announcement set for thursday 
are issuing interim rules for commercial fishing boats said 
officials from their agencies commenting on condition of anonymity 
under the new rules seizures of commercial fishing vessels in 
operation or en route to or from fishery operations will be 
prohibited if the amount of drugs found is personal use 
quantities that is generally described as less than one gram of 
cocaine or heroin and less than one ounce of marijuana 
instead of being immediately seized and escorted to port to await 
forfeiture proceedings by the customs service fishing vessel 
operators will be given a summons and ordered to appear before the 
agency at the completion of the fishing trip customs officials then 
will decide whether the vessel should be forfeited or if a penalty 
should be imposed 
the joint customscoast guard announcement also outlines 
expedited administrative procedures for the forfeiture process 
setting a maximum 20day period for a final decision 
the announcement will not however detail other congressionally 
mandated changes in the zero tolerance policy including a 
provision to protect innocent owners by ordering a vessels release 
if owners can prove drug offenses occurred without their knowledge 
consent or willful blindness

two days of celebrations marking the anniversary of 
lithuanian independence began wednesday in the city of kaunas 
despite demands by ethnic russians the event be canceled reform 
movement sources said 
according to the lithuanian information center in new york 
15000 ethnic russians rallied in lithuanias capital of vilnius on 
sunday to protest the celebrations they called for the removal of 
the republics government because of what they called nationalist 
tendencies 
speakers at the sunday rally criticized the lithuanian reform 
movement sajudis and denounced a government decree making lithuanian 
the republics official language 
celebrations are starting now in kaunas where independence was 
proclaimed on feb 16 1918 kazimeras moteka a member of the 
sajudis council said in a telephone call from capital of vilnius 
lithuania was a russian province under the rule of the czars and 
proclaimed its independence following the bolshevik revolution of 
1917 but it was incorporated into the soviet union in 1940 under a 
secret pact between the kremlin and germany 
alvydas medalinskas a spokesman for the movement told the 
lithuanian information center the commemorative program would last 
for two days and that the program was not changed because of 
pressure from the russian community 
however medalinskas said the lithuanian government and 
authorities in moscow apparently had bowed to russian pressure and 
had scaled back planned tv coverage of the celebrations 
russians make up 10 percent of lithuanias 37 million 
population the smallest russian minority in the baltic states of 
lithuania estonia and latvia 
on monday about 100000 mostly ethnic russians rallied in 
vilnius protesting the language decree adopted earlier this year 
the communist party newspaper pravda said 
the protesters claimed that such a decree is a violation of 
human rights of nonlithuanian people living in the republic

wildlife agents and dozens of news organizations 
waited in boats this morning for sea lions to return to a floating 
trap that officials hope will keep migrating salmon and steelhead 
from becoming sea lions lunch 
at least a dozen sea lions were basking in the floating cage when 
wildlife agents with reporters and photographers there to capture 
the battle launched their latest plan to stop the steelhead and 
salmon suppers 
but there were too many sea lions in the cage for national 
oceanic and atmospheric administation agents to handle so the agents 
yelled and slapped the water with paddles to scare them away 
the sea lions stop at the ballard locks near the canal as they 
migrate from southern california and feast on steelhead which are 
rainbow trout headed back to their native streams and rivers in 
western washington to spawn after a few years at sea the locks a 
gateway for fishing vessels as well as migrating salmon that are 
also preyed on connect saltwater puget sound with freshwater lake 
washington and lake union 
officials launched operation goodbye the sixth plan in five 
years in an effort to save the valuable fish runs agents hope to 
move the sea lions from the sound to the long beach peninsula some 
250 miles away 
this is our best opportunity so far hal alabaster of the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration said tuesday 
wildlife officials hope to pull the door to the floating cage 
shut today then take the sea lions two at a time to a barge for 
removal to a hangar at the sandpoint naval base on the lake 
washington shore state wildlife department spokesman bob byrne said 
there the sea lions will be tagged and equipped with radio 
collars to monitor their travels after being dropped off 250 miles 
to the southwest near long beach peninsula where the columbia river 
meets the pacific alabaster said 
were confident this plan is going to work he said at the 
very least itll be a good test of how long it takes them to get 
back some are guessing theyll beat the trucks back to seattle 
the sea lions are being tagged with colored streamers to tell if 
any of the culprits returns to the locks 
at stake is the run of 1600 steelhead expected to approach the 
locks by april with the peak late this month or in early march an 
average of five sea lions a day has been camping in the ship canal 
and near the locks each eating a couple of steelhead daily to the 
distress of fishermen who depend on the run byrne said 
the war with the sea lions began about five years ago when 
officials detonated noisemaking bombs to try to scare them away 
alabaster said but the bewhiskered diners quickly got used to the 
underwater booms 
wildlife officials then tried playing tapes of the sounds made by 
killer whales the sea lions werent fooled the noaa official said 
lithium fluoride a chemical used to stop wolves from eating 
sheep was injected into some steelhead fed to sea lions but the 
seagoing predators didnt become nauseous as expected alabaster 
said 
officials turned to nets to capture the sea lions but the 
mammals simply eluded them they were too smart alabaster said 
a steel mesh barrier that would let fish through but block sea 
lions also proved ineffective 
after officials tried the nets some lumber company had a 
reader board and they put up sea lions 4 government 0 or 
something like that alabaster said it was pretty embarassing

scientists say they have determined the 
threedimensional structure of an enzyme the aids virus needs to 
spread its infection a step that could lead to new aids drugs 
an enzyme is a protein that initiates or speeds up a chemical 
reaction the findings published in thursdays issue of the british 
journal nature are the first report on the threedimensional 
structure of any protein of the virus 
the discovery will help researchers develop drugs to block the 
enzyme and keep the aids virus from spreading said manuel navia 
who with eight other scientists from the merck sharp and dohme 
research laboratories in rahway nj and west point pa 
reported the findings 
its pretty dramatic said aids researcher jay levy of the 
university of california at san francisco 
william haseltine of the danafarber cancer institute in boston 
called the finding an important and critical step along the 
pathway to rational antiaids drug development 
the enzyme which looks like a tangled string in the general 
shape of an angelfish is called an aspartal protease and it comes 
into play as the aids virus makes copies of itself 
to reproduce the virus infects a cell and hijacks the cells 
proteinmaking machinery it then orders the machinery to produce 
proteins including the aspartal protease for assembling new 
viruses 
the proteins are manufactured in a string like cars on a train 
but the proteins which new viruses need to infect other cells will 
not work unless they are separated the newly analyzed enzyme is 
responsible for cutting the proteins apart 
if a drug can be found to inhibit the enzymes function it could 
stop the spread of infection navia said 
haseltine said such a drug should also keep an infected person 
from being infectious to others researchers would have to make sure 
that the drug would not block similar enzymes elsewhere in a 
persons body levy said 
as of monday the federal centers for disease control had counted 
a cumulative total of 86157 aids cases in the nation with 49390 
deaths

coretta scott king told new hud secretary jack 
kemp on wednesday he had raised expectations about the bush 
administrations commitment to easing urban problems and now must 
deliver 
kemp in his first duties as the new secretary of housing and 
urban development completed a highvisibility tour of atlantas 
poor black neighborhoods and pledged to work to increase the 
availability of afffor lowincome people through 
both public and private efforts 
you have really raised our hopes and excited people about the 
prospects of something happening with housordable housing ing and jobs 
mrs king 
widow of the late civil rights leader martin luther king jr told 
kemp 
from what weve heard you say we think you mean business 
she said if something happens and there is not the follow 
through youre going to have a lot of disappointed people 
kemp met privately with mrs king and her sons then attended a 
meeting with black leaders 
kemp an unsuccessful republican presidential hopeful who has 
sought to broaden the partys appeal to blacks promised to work to 
eliminate discrimination in housing to support affirmative action 
efforts and to encourage more housing for the poor 
im commited to a vigorous effort to expand the housing stock 
both public and ot going to solve the problem said naim 
sheikh the owner of a shop selling leather goods who called for a 
law that would prevent such books from being written again 
there must be some way that governments can approve a 
resolution that in future no writer should have a right to write 
against any prophet mohammed jesus or moses he said 
moslems revere mohammed as the prophet who brought allahs 
revelations to mankind in the koran the holy book of islam 
but do i personally agree with the ayatollah it doesnt 
matter said sheikh one of the many moslem bangladeshis living in 
the brick lane area 
you cant stop the ayatollah you cant stop the people who 
will do the job anyone who kills rushdie will become a hero in 
the islamic world 
like sheikh most moslems acknowledged they havent read the 
book most learned about it at one of the five mosques located in a 
onesquaremile area of this district from leaflets or from 
television reports 
he insulted our prophet our religion from tv we know this 
said a shopkeeper selling sticky sweets who refused to give his name 
even though they havent read the book they are sure it insults 
their prophet and are quick to say so when the novel is mentioned 
our older people read it they say its wrong so we believe 
them nassim khan a pakistani moslem said as he ate lunch at a 
modest tandoori restaurant theyve been studying for years and 
years and they should know 
maqbool alikassam waiting for his takeout tea boomed from 
across the room anyone who denies the religion of islam shall be 
killed 
alikassam a taxi cab radio controller who calls himself a 
follower of the ayatollah said he believes rushdie deliberately 
meant to insult islam 
dozens of drivers from his company stayed at the office until 
early wednesday morning he said arguing about the book and the 
execution order some said he didnt mean anything about islam 
others wanted him killed 
many moslems believe rushdie 41 insults mohammed by portraying 
him as a character called mahound a prophet of a city called 
jahilia mahound was a medieval corruption of the word mohammed 
they are especially angered by one sequence in which prostitutes 
are given the names of some of mohammeds nine wives and by the 
books implication that mohammed not allah may have been the real 
author of the koran 
rushdie was born into a moslem family in bombay india and 
educated in cambridge he lives in london his novel has sold more 
than 100000 copies since it was published in britain in september 
to critical acclaim 
previously mohammed has been criticized but not in this naked 
way said abul khair a top officer at the sonali bank 
bangladeshs state bank on brick lane it is intolerable for 
moslems 
but he doesnt agree with the ayatollah we dont want 
violence islam is a peaceful religion he said 
restaurant manager asaad ramjaun a mauritian immigrant said of 
rushdie i think hes the devil himself 
we understand this is a free society but i think this is 
freedom of abuse he said but since this is a free society he 
shouldnt be killed he should be given a chance

art didnt just imitate life at the north 
carolina museum of art it hatched it in the form of 100 praying 
mantises 
an egg sac containing the insects hitched a ride into the museum 
on one of the maple saplings that artist patrick t dougherty used 
in his sculpture shelters of transition 
the museums warm springlike air prompted the pecansize bundle 
of eggs to begin hatching last weekend the first of the halfinch 
critters were noticed friday by security guards 
anna upchurch a museum spokeswoman said the saplings had been 
fumigated in the parking lot for several days prior to the 
sculptures installation which began in midjanuary the exhibit 
runs through march 26 
but apparently the eggs survived the chemical warfare 
the bugs posed no danger to other artwork because they eat other 
insects not canvas or plaster she said 
there is nothing for them to eat in the museum except each 
other ms upchurch said praying mantises are sometimes 
cannibalistic 
as more hatched over the weekend they were sucked into a vacuum

randall crippen 24 of shinglehouse suffered head and face 
injuries said dena michaelson spokeswoman at hamot medical center 
in erie 
crippen was struck on the head by a fiveinch limb of a falling 
tree tuesday according to officials at bradford hospital where the

fire chief cliff hastings said it took rescuers nearly four hours 
to get crippen to bradford about 15 miles from a densely wooded 
mountain ridge 
about 50 volunteer firefighters paramedics and other volunteers 
took turns carrying the injured man on a stretcher 1 miles to a 
clearing at the base of the ridge where dr glenn irwin and 
paramedics were waiting hastings said 
others carried bottled oxygen to crippen running in relays from 
a command post on the logging trail 
irwin medical director for advanced life support services at

tracheotomy that involved cutting a hole in the mans throat to 
open a passage in his windpipe 
the doctor worked on the back of a pickup with instruments he 
brought from the hospital the operation took place at the end of a 
dirt logging trail

the percentage of elderly americans dying in 
nursing homes rose sharply during the 1980s as hospitals began 
discharging terminally ill patients to save money a new study 
concludes 
the report largely attributed the change to medicare rules that 
encourage hospitals to release elderly patients as quickly as 
possible 
however it said that other costcutting pressures including the 
rise of health maintenance organizations may also have contributed 
dr mark a sager who directed the study said that sending 
dying people to nursing homes rather than keeping them in hospitals 
is not necessarily a bad trend 
it may be very appropriate and less costly he said in an 
interview the issue is whether nursing homes can adequately take 
care of a sicker population today than they were seeing a few years 
ago 
however sager said there is no sign that quicker hospital 
discharges have shortened these peoples lives 
medicares new payment system began in 1983 instead of covering 
patients actual expenses the program pays hospitals flat fees in 
advance for each patient hospitals get the same amount for each 
patient with a specific disease regardless of whether the patient 
stays in the hospital for a day or a month 
meanwhile another report showed medicare expenditures have risen 
less sharply than experts predicted a decade ago 
a study directed by dr louise b russell of rutgers university 
estimated the medicare payment program will be responsible for a 3 
percent reduction in the nations total health care bill which is 
expected to be 650 billion in 1990 
in 1980 the hospital insurance trust fund the branch of the 
government that actually pays medicare bills predicted it would be 
spending about 55 billion by 1990 instead it appears the actual 
expense by then will be 43 billion in 1980 dollars the study said 
the savings will amount to 18 billion in 1990 dollars 
both studies were published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine 
sagers study found that in 1981 65 percent of all deaths among 
people over 65 occured in hospitals by 1985 this had fallen to 61 
percent at the same time the proportion of deaths occurring in 
nursing homes rose from 19 percent to 215 percent 
what has to be said is that hospitals are in a bind because 
they are being pressured by cost cutting said sager a physician 
at dean medical center in madison wis nursing homes are in a 
bind because nobody wants to pay for nursing home care patients are 
in a bind because they are in a system that does not want to provide 
continuity of care and health care financing is fragmented 
his study found that in 198384 35 states showed significant 
declines in hospital deaths while 33 reported increases in nursing 
home deaths in new york new jersey massachusetts and maryland 
states that did not initially participate in the new payment system 
there was no change in where people died 
his work also found that the changes were most pronounced in the 
midwest south and west he could not entirely explain this 
difference but said some of it might have resulted from the heavy 
concentration of hmos in these regions 
hmos try to minimize hospital stays because members pay flat 
rates for comprehensive care

a public interest group on wednesday sharply 
criticized a proposed consent agreement between budget rentacar 
and the federal trade commission that would allow budget to rent 
cars with unrepaired safety defects 
the ftcbudget solution is dumb dangerous and potentially 
disastrous said ann brown chairwoman of the consumer affairs 
committee of americans for democratic action 
under the proposed agreement announced dec 28 budget could 
choose to ignore manufacturer safety defect recall campaigns by 
posting a disclaimer indicating that the affected vehicle is 
subject to a recall notice and has not been inspected or 
repaired 
william macleod director of the ftcs bureau of consumer 
protection said the circumstances which gave rise to the consent 
agreement dated back several years and have since been rectified 
there is a procedure in place at budget whereby these things 
safety defects are repaired the cars are in fact repaired 
according to the recall notices he said 
commenting on the ada committees statement macleod said it 
sounds to me like they are making a controversy out of whole cloth 
at budget rentacar headquarters in chicago spokeswoman jody 
wilson said the company had no immediate comment on the ada panels 
criticism of the consent agreement she cited a press release issued 
dec 30 by budget saying we have always provided our customers 
with safe reliable cars 
ms brown told a news conference that sometimes consumer 
information and even clear disclaimers provide no useful consumer 
protection this is one of the clearest examples 
when a car is known to be unsafe it simply shouldnt be on 
the road no amount of nebulous warnings will protect a car renter 
from a dangerous lifethreatening defect she said 
in comments submitted to the ftc the ada panel said it 
strongly opposes giving budget rentacar or any other auto rental 
firm an option to ignore safety recalls it offers great risk to 
customers that is not outweighed by the relatively minimal cost 
savings 
fred b goldberg an attorney who prepared the ada statement 
said the organization hopes that the ftc will vote to reject the 
proposed consent agreement after a public comment period ends march 
6 
he noted that budgets rental fleet includes for example the 
1988 buick regal for which five recalls were issued last year 
the defects include potential disengagement of the steering 
column undesired resumption of cruise control loss of braking 
capacity unexpected opening of the cars hood each of which poses 
a clear safety threat goldberg said

the food and drug administration said wednesday 
it is asking eye doctors to warn their contact lens patients that 
improper use of homemade salt solutions can lead to damaged vision 
and even blindness 
the fda said the solutions are not sterile and can become 
contaminated with microorganisms that can cause serious and painful 
eye infections 
homemade salt solutions prepared by dissolving salt tablets or 
capsules in water can be used safely in heat disinfection of 
contact lenses or just before heat disinfection because the high 
temperature kills any germs that might be in the solution the salt 
itself however does not kill any germs 
if a contaminated solution is used after disinfection 
microorganisms can enter the eye and cause serious infections the 
fda said 
homemade solutions also should not be used with chemical 
disinfection of lenses because while the chemical solution kills 
most microorganisms that cause eye infections it does not eliminate 
a particularly harmful orgamism called acanthamoeba 
acanthamoeba infections which can cause severe eye damage and 
can result in blindness are rare but the fda said their incidence 
appears to be increasing since 1984 about 200 acanthamoeba 
infections have been reported about 90 percent of them in contact 
lens wearers 
the fda said that if homemade salt solutions are used the 
solution should be prepared fresh daily and discarded after use and 
the solution bottle should be sterilized in boiling water for 10 
minutes at least once a week

tired of being a wallflower in 
presidential nomination politics california appears ready to move 
up its primary to make it one of the nations earliest a step that 
could jolt the selection process 
it would be probably one of the most significant changes in the 
texture of the nominating process in the last several decades 
mike mccurry a spokesman for the democratic national committee 
said earlier this month 
it would probably confine the field of likely candidates to 
those that are well financed and able to put together substantial 
state organizing drives 
delegaterich california with more than 13 million registered 
voters and five major tv markets requires several million dollars 
even for a minimal statewide campaign effort 
various proposals would schedule the states presidential primary 
on the third tuesday in february the first tuesday in march or in 
april 
if the february or march proposals had been in effect last year 
californias primary would have come immediately after the iowa 
caucuses and new hampshire primary and would have overshadowed those 
races traditionally the kickoff points for presidential campaigns 
one lawmaker said 
new hampshire has a law mandating that it always be the first 
primary iowa caucuses in which party activists pick committed 
delegates have in the last four elections preceded the new 
hampshire primary by about two weeks 
if youre a candidate running for president do you want to be 
trudging around in the snow in iowa or new hampshire or do you 
want to be in california asks assemblyman mike roos coauthor of 
one early primary bill 
california holds one of the latest primary elections in the 
nation on the first tuesday after the first monday in june and 
its voters have not had a real impact in determining a presidential 
nominee since 1972 even though the state sends the largest blocs of 
delegates to the republican and democratic conventions 
in recent years the nominations of both major parties have been 
locked up or virtually locked up by june 
critics grumble that the late primary has allowed candidates to 
tap the state for campaign donations but ignore issues of particular 
concern to californians such as offshore oil drilling until after 
the conventions 
putting california near the top of the schedule would reverse 
that situation and help the states economy by increasing campaign 
spending here supporters of a change say 
the result is that all of the candidates would spend a lot more 
time in california actively campaigning said assembly minority 
leader ross johnson author of a february primary bill 
the legislature has rejected several previous attempts to move up 
the election date but backers have been picking up influential 
support 
gov george deukmejian once an opponent of early primary 
legislation endorsed the idea in january and the legislatures top 
leaders have all given the concept at least lukewarm support 
there is a growing realization across the board that california 
ought to play a greater role in the candidate selection process 
said johnson it does not make sense for new hampshire and iowa to 
have the disproportionate influence they do

can some of those fancy expensive imported 
fruits hold a candle to the downhome mayhaw 
the mayhaw is a good ol southern crop thats been around for a 
long time says jerry a payne an agriculture department 
scientist because of its tart flavor it makes one of the best 
jellies in the world its just now being rediscovered as a possible 
cash crop from north carolina to texas 
mayhaws grow wild in the acid soils of swamps and shallow ponds 
and are about the size and color of ripe cherry tomatoes they grow 
on thorny trees that can get as high as 25 feet 
payne who is with the departments agricultural research service 
in byron ga said in a report issued here wednesday that mayhaws 
may be catching on for a good reason fruit sells for 5 to 8 a 
gallon and the jelly for 850 per pint 
farmers and homeowners interested in planting mayhaw trees should 
find them widely available in the next few years he said related 
to hawthorns they can live 50 years or longer and remain 
productive some varieties once established can withstand subzero 
temperatures without damage

childrens army of 1500 black children in the tumahole township 
of the orange free state and became a legend in the racial unrest of 
198487 he was jailed under emergency rules at age 10 the youngest 
of the thousands detained and held for 11 months 
mrs mandela had an 80minute meeting wednesday at a prison farm 
near cape town with her husband african national congress leader 
nelson mandela 
when she returned police stopped her van on the highway and 
impounded it mrs mandela her daughter and granddaughter hitched a 
ride with a journalist to her home in soweto the huge black 
township outside johannesburg

released him later 
capt rhv bloomberg said the van was impounded for 
examination for investigation in connection the murder of seipei 
whose decomposed body was identified in a police morgue wednesday 
through fingerprints 
mrs mandela made no comment about the meeting with her husband 
or the controversy that has surrounded her since three men told a 
community meeting in soweto last month about the alleged abduction 
she said she did not know why police took the van and the man 
who met her at the airport and was not identified mrs mandela told 
a police officer we dont want any trouble 
the men said they and seipei were abducted dec 29 and taken to 
mrs mandelas home they said the boy was beaten more severely and 
was taken away after a few days 
their attorney said mrs mandela was involved in the events 
she has denied being home at the time and said the three men and 
stompie seipei were taken from a methodist church residence in 
january to protect them from sexual abuse the church denied the 
charge

act as her bodyguards

soweto after they received an anonymous telephone call the body 
remained in the morgue unidentified until police began investigating 
the disappearance this week

from the years of revolt decided to resume his education and went 
to live in the house operated by the methodist church from which he 
and the others were abducted 
a murder investigation will be conducted because there appear to 
be stab wounds in the neck police said an official statement said 
without elaboration that all people who might be able to assist the 
investigation would be questioned

ago and is serving a life sentence was transferred to a staff house 
at the victor verster prison farm in december after recuperating

asvat a prominent antiapartheid physician saw stompie seipei at 
the mandela home after the boy had been beaten

business inventories rose 09 percent in 
december and sales increased at almost the same pace despite a 
buildup in stockpiles of unsold autos as car purchases lagged the 
commerce department said wednesday 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots rose to a seasonally adjusted 7606 billion in december 
while sales reached 5082 billion 
decembers 09 percent increase in inventories followed a 04 
percent increase in november sales meanwhile rose 08 percent in 
december following a 04 percent increase in november 
because the rates of increase for inventories and sales closely 
tracked one another there was no change in the ratio of inventories 
to sales which stood at 150 meaning it would take 15 months to 
exhaust inventories at the december sales pace 
if not accompanied by rising sales rising inventories can signal 
economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to order 
production cuts and layoffs while they sell off reserve goods 
robert defina senior economist for security pacific national 
bank in los angeles said the balance between sales and stockpiles 
suggests most businesses are in a pretty comfortable position 
the auto industry was an exception with stoent 
says the war left 1 million afghans dead and sent 5 million fleeing 
into iran and pakistan 
moslem guerrillas are massed around kabul the capital and 
western officials believe afghan troops left behind will be defeated 
soon the divided guerrilla leadership has been meeting to try to 
coordinate a strategy 
state department spokesman charles redman said in washington the 
soviet pullout marks a long awaited day for the afghan people and 
they can now go on to determine their own future 
he said the united states would not be proposing any blueprints 
for the future course of afghanistans government 
this whole struggle has been about self determination he 
said well continue to be supportive of the afghan people as they 
pursue this 
the united states has supported efforts to form a broadly based 
government in afghanistan he said but it would not tell the 
afghan people how to go about it redman said us support for the 
rebels continues

a year after the governments n reactor 
was closed backers are encouraged by a study suggesting the 
plutoniumproducing facility could find new life making a weapons 
material whose stockpiles are dwindling 
the government has been without a source of tritium a rapidly 
decaying gas used to increase the power of nuclear weapons since 
the savannah river plant in south carolina shut down last summer for 
safety reasons 
that has raised hopes in the richland area hardhit when the 
energy department closed the n reactor at its hanford weapons 
complex because of a plutonium surplus that cost 1800 jobs and 
ultimately could cost 5000 
its the newest of all the defense reactors and considerably 
newer than the savannah river reactors republican us rep sid 
morrison said tuesday this is an option and one weve worked to 
keep alive 
thenenergy secretary john herrington placed the n reactor on 
cold standby on feb 16 1988 the plant which began operating 
in 1963 had been shut down for more than a year for safety 
improvements spurred by the reactors similarity in design to the 
soviet unions chernobyl plant 
however a department of energy study released this week said the 
n reactor could be converted to make tritium within three years for 
125 million 
the nations supply of tritium is a closely guarded secret the 
energy department has proposed new tritium reactors in south 
carolina and idaho but they are a decade away from production some 
lawmakers and the pentagon have said the shortage threatens national 
security 
the bush administration now must determine future tritium needs 
and whether to restart the savannah river plants before deciding 
what to do with the n reactor said morrison whose district 
includes the sprawling facility 
restarting it would be good news for the economically ravaged 
cities of richland kennewick and pasco the closure has cost 1800 
jobs with 1000 more to be lost when shutdown work concludes by 
october according to westinghouse hanford co which operates most 
hanford operations for the energy department 
more important the closing sounded the death knell for all 5000 
plutonium production jobs at hanford by the 1990s thats when the 
stockpile of plutonium produced by the n reactor for further 
processing at hanford will run out 
the shutdown was the most disastrous thing thats ever hit this 
area said sam volpentest director for the tricity industrial 
development councils hanford division which lobbies congress for 
new projects at the 560squaremile site 
much of the economic impact of the shutdown has been delayed by 
an early retirement and voluntary layoff program and by the decision 
of many workers to seek jobs elsewhere many reactor workers filled 
other vacancies on the site 
employees are now removing the 1003 nuclear fuel rods a job 
that should be completed by the end of march 
problems began for the n reactor shortly after the 1986 chernobyl 
disaster that killed a reported 31 people and spread radiation 
around the world much was made of the n reactors design 
similarities including graphite in the reactor core and the lack of 
a containment dome 
the n reactor was shut down in january 1987 for 100 million in 
safety improvements that touched off a political battle over its 
restart 
but the issue became moot with herringtons announcement that the 
nation had ample plutonium and no longer needed the n reactor 
hanford officials all along disputed the chernobyl comparisons 
and wallace ruff manager of the defense reactor division said the 
improvements have made an already safe reactor safer the work 
included pressure tests on the containment system and improvements 
to the emergency cooling and seismic systems 
recent risk assessments on the n reactor show it to be comparable 
to commercial reactors ruff said even though energy department 
plants are not subject to nuclear regulatory commission standards

antiapartheid church leaders 
wednesday urged some of the 300 detainees on a hunger strike to 
suspend the fast while efforts are made to resolve the crisis 
the detainees some of whom have not eaten since jan 23 are 
demanding they be released or put on trial twentyone have been 
hospitalized and church leaders said they were worried about the 
health of the men 
we urge the detainees particularly those already in the danger 
zone to suspend their action while church leaders lawyers 
community leaders and the public seek ways of resolving the 
problem the rev frank chikane told a news conference in 
johannesburg 
chikane anglican archbishop desmond tutu and rev allan boesak 
planned to discuss the hunger strike thursday in cape town with the 
minister of law and order adriaan vlok 
vlok has said the government cannot be blackmailed by the 
estimated 1000 people in detention but 17 men were released 
tuesday including two who were participating in the strike 
chikane said the church leaders were asking only those detainees 
who were sick or who had been fasting most of the 23 days to resume 
eating 
we are concerned that their health could be permanently 
damaged said chikane leader of the south african council of 
churches which represents most major protestant denominations 
we are encouraged that minister vlok is willing to address the 
situation of emergency detainees as a matter of urgency chikane 
said 
but he added if he does not respond positively he will create 
a serious problem 
the strike began at diepkloof prison outside johannesburg on jan 
23 and has spread to several cities around the country some of the 
participants have been held without charge since the nationwide 
state of emergency was declared in june 1986 
lawyers said wednesday that an undetermined number of the 111 
detainees at westville prison in durban had joined the hunger strike 
and that detainees at a nearby prison in pietermaritzburg will stop 
eating monday 
student leaders at five south african universities began a hunger 
strike wednesday in solidarity with the detainees they said it 
would last eight days 
we support the detainees demand to be charged or released 
the group said in a statement we see their demand as a response 
to the intransigence of a government intent on criminalizing the 
voice of the majority of south africans 
at the university of the western cape outside cape town about 
2000 students participated in a rally calling for the release of 
the hunger strikers 
in another development wednesday an inquest began into the 1985 
killings of black teacher and activist matthew goniwe and three 
colleagues 
goniwes associates contend the four were assassinated because of 
their involvement in the antiapartheid movement no suspects have 
been arrested 
goniwe and fort calata sparrow mkhonto and sicelo mhlawuli 
vanished on june 27 1985 after starting back to their hometown of 
cradock from a meeting in port elizabeth of the united democratic 
front an antiapartheid coalition to which they belonged 
their burnedour car was found near port elizabeth the next day 
their bodies burned and stabbed were discovered during a fiveday

the government wednesday thanked the 
soviet union for its help in afghanistan but said future relations 
should develop on the basis of noninterference in each others 
internal affairs 
the last soviet soldiers who had been fighting moslem guerrillas 
left afghan soil earlier in the day meeting the unmediated 
deadline set by an accord signed in april 
the government of the republic of afghanistan on behalf of the 
entire people of the country expresses its appreciation to the 
people and the government of the soviet union for their allsided 
assistance and continued solidarity in the cause of defending 
afghanistans national sovereignty political independence and 
territorial integrity the government said 
it accused the united states and pakistan of virtually 
trampling on the geneva agreements that paved the way for the 
withdrawal of the soviet soldiers who entered the country in 
december 1979 
the statement said the united states and pakistan shraply 
increased their support for the guerrillas since the accord was 
signed in april 
it said the government of president najib was confident relations 
with the soviet union would develop on the basis of friendship 
mutually beneficial good neighborliness equal sovereignty and 
noninterference in each others internal affairs 
the statement also denounced the shura or council being held in 
pakistan by the guerrillas who have predicted najibs government 
will fall within weeks of the soviet withdrawal the shura is to 
coordinate their plans for a postwar government 
pakistan has been making futile efforts of late to forge 
various afghan opposition groups into a socalled shura and a 
transitional government on the territory of pakistan by exerting 
enormous pressure on them such hostile and expansionist schemes 
which are aimed at infringing upon the independence of afghanistan 
are resolutely rejected and condemned by the people and the 
government it said 
residents of the besieged capital said they hoped the completion 
of the withdrawal would lead to peace after 10 years of civil war 
the russians are gone said a merchant in the citys old 
bazaar who identified himself as hasan now there will be peace 
he said as he tried to sell one of the few soviet fur hats left in 
the shopping district 
we are brothers another merchant said referring to the 
moslem guerrillas outside the capital we can solve our problems 
without foreigners the problems are just between afghans we dont 
need help from foreigners said the jewelry seller who gave only 
his first name ghulam 
the pullout from kabul was completed tuesday night when about 80 
red army troops at the citys airport filed twobytwo onto four 
military transport planes that took them home

moslem guerrilla leaders presented a 
plan for an interim government in afghanistan and said wednesday 
they would take control of their country swiftly now that soviet 
forces have gone 
delegates to a special council chanted death to the russians 
and god is great as their leaders declared that the kremlin had 
suffered a devastating and humiliating defeat 
the last red army soldiers left afghanistan on wednesday after 
nine years of involvement in the civil war that cost the soviets 
about 15000 dead and 35000 wounded 
it was the power of the faith the steadfastness and 
determination of the afghan moslem nation that forced the russians 
to leave our nation guerrilla leader rasul sayyaf told a news 
conference 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in 1978 
and before the withdrawal began last may under a unmediated 
agreement faced an estimated 115000 soviet soldiers as well as the 
afghan army 
sayyaf said a plan for an interim government was presented to the 
council or shura of about 400 delegates and would be debated for 
several days before a vote was taken 
it calls for approval of a provisional government the guerrillas 
created last summer with ahmed shah as prime minister but some 
cabinet appointments announced previously are expected to be changed 
leaders of the seven parties in the insurgent alliance based in 
pakistan have been deeply divided for years competing for power and 
influence ahmed shah leads one of the parties 
wednesdays session was the first full one since the shura 
assembled friday it became deadlocked almost immediately and party 
leaders wrangled over key issues in private 
the council is seen as the best chance for the guerrillas to form 
a united government that could take control and restore peace and 
stability to afghanistan after 11 years of war 
even with an interim government top party leaders are expected 
to retain ultimate control sayyaf said the seven leaders would 
serve as an executive body for the temporary administration 
afghanistans marxist government said wednesday the councils 
decisions were meaningless the decision of the socalled shura is 
not important to the afghan nation said kabul radio monitored in 
islamabad 
guerrilla officials speaking privately said some council 
delegates expressed opposition wednesday to ahmed shah or said an 
individual should be head of state rather than the collective 
leadership 
one of the seven parties the afghan national liberation front 
boycotted the council officials of the party said they would not 
return until shiite moslem guerrillas based in iran were included in 
the council or shura 
front leader sibghatullah mojaddidi had offered the shiites 100 
seats in the council and seven cabinet posts leaders of the other 
six parties rejected the plan 
most of the guerrillas based in pakistan are sunni moslems as 
are 80 percent of afghanistans people shiites make up about 15 
percent of the population 
sayyaf said the council had appointed a committee to deal with 
the shiite issue he also said all parties would attend the council 
thursday but aides to mojaddidi said their party would stay out 
until the question was resolved 
shiite representatives have said they will accept nothing less 
than mojaddidis proposal

the new family on the block mom dad three 
kids and a dog have settled into their victorian mansion on 
massachusetts avenue and already thrown a video slumber party to 
break in the place 
but even when youre master of the vice presidential digs like 
dan quayle you find there are some things that dont change 
quayle who moved his family into the vice presidents official 
residence a week ago agreed to let his three children each have a 
friend over for a slumber party saturday night 
dad accompanied son tucker 14 to a local video store to pick 
out the evenings entertainment quayle was instructed by his wife 
marilyn to supervise the selection process and to put a 
twovideo limit on tucker according to quayles press secretary 
david beckwith 
i guess i didnt do a very good job of supervising because he 
got away with four quayle told beckwith adding that he stood in 
line for 10 minutes to return them sunday night 
the comedy lineup included moonstruck vice versa 
throw momma from the train and planes trains and 
automobiles 
with the first slumber party behind them and the quayle family 
ensconced in their new home there is remodeling yet to be done and 
things to get used to like a staff of stewards 
the remodeling plans are on hold pending a private fundraising 
effort being handled by a group of quayles friends the work is to 
include installing a bathroom for daughter corinne since all three 
children are sharing one bathroom now redoing one upstairs bedroom 
as a family room and reconfiguring the childrens bedrooms on the 
third floor 
in addition mrs quayle wants a laundry room on the third floor 
since she intends to do the childrens laundry according to a 
spokeswoman 
the stately threestory residence is situated on the sprawling 
naval observatory grounds in northwest washington near the british 
embassy and a treelined upscale residential neighborhood 
president bush lived there for eight years as vice president but 
while bush and his wife barbara often had a bevy of grandchildren 
underfoot with frequent visits by the five bush offspring and their 
families none of the children lived with them 
the 42yearold quayle brings a crew that includes tucker and 
benjamin 12 and corinne 10 and an arthritic labrador madame 
justice 14 
the current laundry facilities are in the basement below the 
large firstfloor rooms that are decorated with elegant period 
furnishings and are more suited to entertaining than to family life 
beckwith said that for the quayles purposes the house is very 
spacious its just not configured for a family with children at the 
moment 
aides to mrs quayle brushed aside most questions about the 
quayles personal lives one aide speaking on condition of

former prime minister paul vanden 
boeynants said wednesday he spent his month as a kidnap victim 
hooded and handcuffed and never saw his captors faces or heard 
their voices 
vanden boeynants described the kidnappers who abducted him jan 
14 as professional criminals interested only in money he said 
they were well organized and operated with military discipline 
my impression is that i was in france vanden boeynants said 
two days after he was freed by his kidnappers who were paid a 
ransom of hundreds of thousands of dollars 
the wealthy businessman said his captors possibly as many as 
five first sought a 10 million ransom but reduced the demand after 
reading a newspaper article indicating he was not as rich as they 
thought 
at a news conference vanden boeynants said he spent almost all 
his time in captivity handcuffed and hooded the first two weeks 
were spent under threat of a gun he said 
the kidnappers calling themselves the socialist revolutionary 
brigade used the guise of a leftwing terrorist group to mislead 
investigators and had no political motives said vanden boeynants 
we dont give a damn about politics we want money he quoted 
them as telling him in a typewritten note 
all communication with his kidnappers was done through such 
notes said vanden boeynants 69 he said he remained calm 
throughout the ordeal by repeatedly telling himself youre not 
going to die here 
he said two men attacked him the evening of jan 14 after he had 
parked his car in the garage of his apartment building in brussels 
during a struggle a third man came to help the assailants they 
pulled a hood over vanden boeynants head dragged him into a car 
and drove for about 2 to three hours 
for the next four weeks vanden boeynants said he was kept in a 
darkened room in a house and always wore the hood his handcuffs 
were only taken off to allow him to eat or go to the bathroom 
he was released late monday in tournai 50 miles southwest of 
brussels after his family paid the abductors a ransom that police 
say totaled several tens of million of francs ten million 
francs is about 250000 
vanden boeynants did not reveal the sum paid but did not dispute 
the estimate given by police 
some newspapers reported tuesday the ransom totaled 161 million 
vanden boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and again 
from 1978 to 1979 he was also defense minister for seven years 
during the 1970s and served as a brussels city councilman for more 
than 30 years starting in 1953 
he received a threeyear suspended sentence and was fined nearly 
17000 in 1986 for tax fraud and forgery as head of a brussels 
meatpacking company

the prosecutor in oliver norths irancontra 
case today outlined procedures which he said would would enable the 
trial to go forward with the agreement of the justice department 
under the procedures independent counsel lawrence walsh said he 
would if necessary request an affidavit from attorney general dick 
thornburgh to prevent the introduction of classified information at 
norths trial 
in a fourparagraph statement walsh said he was issuing the 
procedures in response to tuesdays order by the judge in the case 
which bars thornburgh from filing affidavits at any time during 
norths trial to block disclosure of specific classified material 
government sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
justice department agreed to the procedures after department 
officials met with the independent counsels staff the department 
will now go to the supreme court and seek to abandon a stay issued 
sunday at the departments request by chief justice william 
rehnquist 
walshs statement came after the judge in the case said that if 
the justice department is intent on preventing the trial it should 
do so now instead of trying to chop up the case with constant 
censorship demands 
us district judge gerhard gesell on tuesday rejected a justice 
department bid to intervene in the case whenever they feel it 
necessary to block disclosure of classified information instead 
gesell said the independent counsel prosecuting the case would have 
that authority 
norths lawyers revealed more of their planned defense on 
tuesday saying that the reagan administration offered cia covert 
support to central american nations if they would help the contras 
during a period in which congress had banned us aid 
the alleged quid pro quo added a detail to the scenario 
outlined earlier this week by norths attorneys who say reagan and 
other top administration officials ordered that the arrangements be 
kept secret 
the justice department wants to limit the amount of evidence 
released on the arrangements saying more extensive disclosures 
could harm national security norths lawyers say the information is 
essential to his defense 
four of the 12 criminal charges against north involve allegedly 
misleading congress in 1985 and 1986 by denying reports of national 
security council efforts on behalf of the contras three other 
counts say he obstructed congress an inquiry by the attorney 
general and destroyed documents in november 1986 by shredding 
material that concerned aid to the contras 
gesell said tuesday he wont let thornburgh chop up the case 
with a series of affidavits barring disclosure of information each 
time north tried to introduce evidence the government found 
objectionable 
he noted that thornburgh could invoke the classified information 
procedures act and bar any such disclosures that however could 
make any trial of north impossible 
he can act now if he wants gesell told thornburgh deputy 
stephen saltzburg 
otherwise gesell said decisions on possible challenges to 
classified information will be left to walsh 
saltzburg had proposed a threestep process for dealing with 
classified information 
he said the government through walsh would first seek to 
fashion for the court a summary of facts failing that the 
prosecution would then seek to censor portions of the material and 
as a last resort have the attorney general object to disclosure of 
the specific information in question 
the judge rejected the last part of saltzburgs proposal saying 
the only time the attorney general may come into court with an 
affidavit is to terminate a count or terminate the case 
under that drastic procedure once the attorney general files the 
affidavit the court would have to order north not to disclose the 
information on national security grounds even though it is relevant 
to his defense that could lead to dismissal of charges 
the department was reviewing gesells order meeting with the 
independent counsel and reviewing the options said thornburgh 
aide david runkel 
the supreme court meets privately friday to consider a further 
stay 
gesell earlier this week noted the possibility that north had 
been put between a rock and a hard place by his superiors 
questioned by congress and others about the contra aid efforts but 
told by his bosses in the reagan administration to keep the 
arrangements secret 
north lawyer brendan sullivan says the arrangements and the 
alleged coverup must be presented to the jury in opening statements 
and detailed in crossexamination if north is to have a fair trial 
the inducement held out to central american nations in return 
for their military support for the resistance was in part cia 
covert support sullivan said tuesday in a court filing

the un official who negotiated the red 
armys withdrawal from afghanistan said wednesday that the pullout 
was officially concluded even though some soviet soldiers will 
remain behind as advisers 
diego cordovez special un representative for afghanistan 
confirmed that more than 100000 soviet troops had been withdrawn by 
the feb 15 deadline set under the un agreement 
officially i can tell you that they the soviet troops have 
left said cordovez a former undersecretarygeneral who now is 
the foreign minister of ecuador 
cordovez personally negotiated the soviet withdrawal accord among 
the governments of afghanistan pakistan the soviet union and the 
united states the antisoviet guerrillas were not part of the 
negotiations 
cordovez said the un observer team in the region is satisfied 
of the exemplary manner in which the time frame for withdrawal 
has been fulfilled very very strictly both in the first phase and 
the completion of the second phase 
cordovez said the soviet union is leaving behind only a few 
military advisers less than 10 a residual presence 
he did not elaborate and said he had no information about soviet 
civilian advisers who might remain 
he indicated that the presence of soviet military advisers did 
not violate the afghan agreements because the united states and 
other nations which have closed their embassies have left behind 
guards 
despite the withdrawal cordovez failed to persuade afghans to 
form a broadbased transition government as soviet troops withdrew 
the future government he said must be decided by the afghan people 
themselves without outside interference 
he cited the history of friendship between afghanistan and the 
soviet union and predicted the kabul regime would always be friendly 
toward the soviet union or at least not hostile 
he declined specific comment on whether aid provided by the 
united states and pakistan to the rebels violates the un 
agreements provisions against intereference by other nations 
anything that fuels hostilities would be a violation of the 
letter of spirit of the agreement he said 
the soviet withdrawal began may 15 under unmediated accords 
signed in geneva on april 14 by afghanistan and pakistan with the 
united states and soviet union signing as guarantors 
fifty un military observers in afghanistan have a 20month 
mandate to fulfill they are to concentrate on assisting the 
repatriation of afghan refugees and the rehabilitation of the 
country

only three people have turned in assault 
rifles to police since the city council banned the semiautomatic 
weapons following a schoolyard rampage in which a gunman killed five 
children authorities said 
the ban on a variety of assault weapons began tuesday one week 
after the council passed it unanimously 
police lt george lerner said that although only three residents 
have given assault rifles to police others are selling their guns 
or storing them outside the city to comply with the law 
certainly wed like to see them off the streets altogether 
but they have alternatives to stay within the law lerner said 
the ban was in response to the jan 17 attack in which patrick 
edward purdy sprayed his akm47 at cleveland elementary school 
students killing five youngsters and wounding 30 other people he 
then took his own life 
some gun shop owners said people wont give the guns to police 
because the weapons are expensive starting at around 300 
nobody is going to turn them in to the cops said tim 
cassidy owner of cassidys pawn shop theyll just take them into 
an area where its still legal to have them 
several stockton gun dealers sold their stocks of semiautomatic 
weapons to retailers outside the city and some said they stored the 
guns with other dealers because of the possibility that the ban will 
be overturned in court 
stocktons ban similar to one under study by the state 
legislature prohibits possession or sale of semiautomatic rifles 
with detachable magazines that hold 20 or more rounds and are 
designed for military purposes 
the ordinance also applies to some semiautomatic shotguns and 
pistols 
violators can be sentenced to up to six months in jail and a 500 
fine 
a similar ban has been adopted in los angeles 325 miles south of 
stockton

older americans account for more than half of 
all deaths from drug reactions according to a government report 
wednesday warning of widespread medication problems among the 
elderly 
the report by the health and human services departments 
inspector general pointed to improper use of drugs by the elderly 
misdiagnoses of their conditions by doctors inappropriate dosage 
levels and dangerous combinations of prescribed drugs 
a growing body of evidence accumulated over the past 10 years 
indicates that mismedication of the elderly has become a critical 
health care issue labeled by some as the nations other drug 
problem said the report written by inspector general richard p 
kusserow 
americans over age 60 who comprise 17 percent of the population 
account for 39 percent of all hospitalizations and 51 percent of 
deaths from drug reactions the report said 
in addition according to the report 
in 1985 an estimated 243000 older americans were hospitalized 
for adverse reactions to drugs 
every year 32000 elderly adults fracture their hips in 
druginduced falls 
163000 older adults experience serious mental impairment either 
caused or worsened by drugs 
2 million elderly americans are addicted or at risk of addiction 
to tranquilizers or sleeping pills because of daily use for at least 
one year 
the report said the problems will worsen when government drug 
payments under medicare begin unless an effective druguse review 
system is developed congress directed the health and human services 
department to develop such a system as part of the catastrophic 
health insurance program created under medicare last year 
the drug benefit will begin in 1991 with the government paying 
part of the cost of outpatient prescription drugs that exceed 600 a 
year for a medicare recipient 
before we start having wholesale payment by medicare for these 
prescriptive drugs we should probably take some corrective action 
we should probably try to build greater safeguards for elderly 
americans kusserow said at a news conference 
such measures should include education efforts drug counseling 
pharmacists review of drug regimes in consultation with physicians 
and improved drug labeling he said 
the report said the widespread problem of mismedication was 
due to several weaknesses in the drug therapy delivery system 
including inadequate information about appropriate dosage levels for 
older people most drugs are tested on healthy young adults 
although they may be marketed for conditions common among the 
elderly 
also the report said that physicians are untrained in the area 
of geriatric pharmacology and that only a small percentage of the 
elderly receive drug counseling services even when required by 
state law 
the report also said the elderly more often than not fail to take 
their medications as directed 
compliance with drug regimen rates range from 38 percent to 57 
percent with an average of 45 percent the report said 
medication use problems include underuse and overuse of drugs 
sharing of drugs among family and friends use of outside 
prescriptions and use of damaged medications the report said 
in addition the elderly often suffer from multiple chronic 
diseases and frequently are under the care of more than one 
physician who may prescribe drugs without the knowledge of the 
patients full drug regimen thus the physician may be unaware of 
the potential for drug interactions

chancellor helmut kohls government 
learned in 1987 that libya planned to produce poison gas at a plant 
west german companies are suspected of helping to build kohls 
chief of staff said wednesday 
wolfgang schaeuble also said intelligence reports to the bonn 
leadership dating back to 1980 suggested west german involvement 
with the plant in rabta but that authorities then determined there 
was no conscious participation 
schaeubles disclosures have plunged the bonn government deeper 
into the scandal that has plagued uswest german relations for 
three months 
but he declined to comment when asked whether the mounting 
indications that bonn authorities have known about the rabta plant 
all along have damaged west germanys international prestige 
schaeuble said companies from at least six other countries have 
been mentioned since the controversy over the chemical plant in 
rabta became public in late december he said it was too early to 
assess what responsibility west germany might bear 
schaeuble reported the findings of a government investigation 
into the libyan affair to parliament on jan 18 but the information 
was made public wednesday 
he answered reporters questions about the report after economics 
minister helmut haussmann outlined proposals endorsed by kohls 
cabinet on wednesday that would impose stricter export controls 
the measures parliament could consider this spring include a 
proposed 15year prison term and fines up to 540000 for west 
german businessmen who knowingly provide materials or technical 
knowhow for the production of chemical weapons 
they also broaden the list of chemical biological and nuclear 
materials for which shippers must obtain federal approval to deliver 
abroad as well as reducing the number of countries to which 
sensitive materials can be exported without government authorization 
west germany is the worlds largest exporter and 30 percent of 
the nations companies are involved in international trade 
haussmann said 
us officials informed kohl and foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher during their visit to the united states in november that 
intelligence reports linked the black forest chemical company of 
imhausenchemie to the libyan project 
the allegations were made public in late december and kohl and 
others initially denied they had any indications west german 
companies broke the law 
although authorities now say the us charges probably are 
grounded in fact they say they have no clear evidence against any 
of the companies implicated on which to press charges 
according to schaeubles report the bundesnachrichtendienst 
bnd the countrys central intelligence service sent its first 
report on the libyan plant to the chancellors office and the 
foreign ministry on april 22 1980 
the bnd reported that libya proposed to build a plant to 
produce chemical weapons with the help of east and west german firms 
that were not named schaeuble said 
the bnd considered it possible that what was involved was a 
normal chemical plant a conscious participation by german firms in 
construction of a chemical weapons plant was excluded 
schaeuble repeated claims made by other senior officials over the 
past couple of months that their first substantial information on 
which they could base investigations came only in october 1988

the soviet union ended its costly 
nineyear intervention in afghanistan on wednesday when the last 
soldier the commander of the red army contingent walked across a 
border bridge clutching flowers and accompanied by his teenage son 
i wasnt looking back said lt gen boris gromov after 
leaving afghan soil where 15000 soviets died in a civil war that 
still rages on 
the pullout through this border town where many of the 115000 
soviet troops had entered afghanistan closed a painful chapter in 
soviet history that even mikhail s gorbachev once called a 
bleeding wound 
but it did little to silence the critics who said the kremlins 
december 1979 intervention to aid a marxist government against the 
moslem insurgency was a mistake 
about 200 cheering windburned soldiers clutched automatic rifles 
as they rode mudspattered armored personnel carriers across the 
friendship bridge over the amu darya river on wednesday the 
unmediated deadline for all soviets to be out of afghanistan 
gromov the 45yearold commander of the soviet contingent in 
afghanistan rode the last armored personnel carrier off afghan soil 
his vehicle stopped halfway across the bridge linking termez with 
the afghan town of khairaton and his 14yearold son maxim ran 
out he gave his father a bouquet of carnations and they walked 
arminarm the final yards to soviet soil 
at the border the sunburned general appeared to be near tears 
when he said his thoughts were for his countrymen who served or died 
in afghanistan 
i thought about those who were left behind but most 
importantly about those who have come home said gromov who took 
command in afghanistan in 1984 on his third tour of duty there 
lt col igor azarenok of the soviet defense ministry said 
gromovs headquarters group was the last to leave and the official 
news agency tass said other troops crossed the border wednesday at 
kushka 
in afghanistan tens of thousands of guerrillas reportedly were 
advancing on the capital of kabul and other major cities 
moslem guerrilla leaders in islamabad pakistan presented a plan 
for an interim government in afghanistan that would be debated in 
the coming days 
they would take control of their country swiftly now that the 
soviets are gone delegates to a special council chanted death to 
the russians and god is great as their leaders declared the 
kremlin had suffered a devastating and humiliating defeat 
the afghan government wednesday night thanked the soviet union 
for its assistance but it also said relations between the two 
should develop on the basis of noninterference in each others 
internal affairs 
the kremlin in a statement carried by tass thanked the soviet 
soldiers for fulfilling your patriotic and internationalist 
duty but the communist party daily pravda staterun tv and 
commentators questioned whether the kremlin was correct in sending 
troops into afghanistan in the first place 
some of the troops at the border ceremony also said getting 
involved was a mistake 
it was a clear error so many died said senior sgt asgat 
husayinov 22 he said afghanistan was a hell after which you fear 
nothing except maybe yourself 
the soviets acknowledged that 15000 of its soldiers were killed 
and more than 35000 wounded in afghanistan the us state 
department estimates that 1 million afghans have been killed 
including combatants and civilians 
the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan seized power 
in a 1978 marxist coup touching off a civil war 
the kremlin sent in the troops in december 1979 to replace the 
promoscow government with another the soviets have said the late 
president leonid brezhnev and a handful of his closest associates 
decided to intervene because the civil war threatened the soviet 
union 
it is possible to doubt the brezhnev leaderships evaluation of 
the level of military threat pravda said wednesday such 
vitally important decisions as the use of troops cannot be decided 
secretly by a small circle of people without the sanction of the 
parliament 
tass raised similar questions 
all these years afghanistan has probably been the greatest 
pain and worry for our people the official news agency said 
scientists politicians soldiers and all other people will be 
thinking and debating for a long time whether the decision of the 
government of the country taken at that time was right 
commentator alexander bovin told the novosti press agency the 
intervention was a tragic mistake despite official 
pronouncements the kremlin never sought victory in the war bovin 
declared it has ended in defeat for us because weve failed to 
cope with the tasks that brought us there 
he said the red army failed to stabilize the kabul government and 
disarm the guerrillas 
the soviet government said afghanistans future will depend on 
whether the guerrilla force shows a sense of responsibility 
selfrestraint and an ability to think not only in terms of 
violence 
the kremlin also called on the united states to prevent further 
bloodshed by stopping its arms shipments to the rebels the soviet 
union reiterated it was prepared to end arms shipments to the kabul 
government 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said the 
end of the soviet pullout marks a long awaited day for the afghan 
people and they can now go on to determine their own future he 
reiterated that us support for the guerrillas will continue 
the united states was the principal supporter of the moslem 
guerrillas but they also were aided by pakistan china and iran 
us secretary of state james a baker iii in portugal on a tour 
of nato countries said the soviets should now help in afghanistans 
reconstruction 
soviet tv devoted the first 17 minutes of its evening news show 
vremya to the pullout and a correspondent said the war would 
not end for mothers who lost their sons and are asking what for 
although gromov described the present situation in afghanistan as 
calm soviet officials estimate 30000 guerrillas are massed around 
kabul which has been blockaded for months foreign ministry 
spokesman vadim perfiliev said 15000 guerrillas were around 
jalalabad and kabul radio said insurgents surrounded herat and 
khandahar 
facing them were 30000 poorly trained afghan army conscripts 
with little loyalty to the sovietbacked marxist regime in kabul 
according to western intelligence some guerrilla commanders say 
they expect fiercer resistance from an estimated 20000 secret 
police elite guardsmen police and armed communist party members 
diego cordovez the special un representative for afghanistan 
who negotiated the soviet withdrawal said in new york that fewer 
than 10 soviet military advisers remain in afghanistan 
literaturnaya gazeta reported that at one point during the war 
red army soldiers intentionally ran over a car carrying seven 
civilians it said they fired at the car because its driver had 
ignored warning shots 
the article implied that all those in the car were killed either 
by gunfire or when it was run over later by an armored personnel 
carrier 
the soldiers had suspected the car was being used by guerrillas 
and the soldiers commander told his men i dont need 
prisoners according to literaturnaya gazeta 
the commander was sentenced to six years in prison but later 
freed in an amnesty the newspaper said

pakistani analysts on wednesday 
praised the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan but said they foresee 
further struggles in the country before its 10yearold civil war 
ends 
this must be the miracle of century its finally come about 
said retired lt gen kamal matinuddin after the last red army 
troops left afghanistan 
as the head of pakistans institute of strategic studies 
matinuddin has followed the decadelong war between communist forces 
and moslem guerrillas 
today is a very historic day it must be marked said ijaz 
gilani research director of the institutes crisis and conflict 
analysis team which has published monthly statistics on the war 
they spoke during a status report on afghanistan at the 
institutes islamabad headquarters 
a foreign ministry spokesman speaking on the usual condition of 
anonymity said the withdrawal paves the way for a comprehensive 
settlement based on the right of the afghan people for 
selfdetermination 
matinuddin said he was skeptical of widespread predictions that 
afghanistans government will fall quickly to the guerrillas in the 
absence of soviet soldiers who entered the country in december 1979 
i dont think its that simple president najibs forces are 
strong i think the most likely scenario is that fighting will 
continue by harassment by mujahedeen attacks on airports and 
such he said 
guerrilla leaders most of whom are based in pakistan said they 
do not plan to launch frontal assaults on communistheld afghan 
cities 
they said their main tactic will be to besiege cities in hopes 
that demoralized government troops will defect to the guerrillas 
causing the communist government to collapse 
matinuddin said the pullout leaves the guerrillas in disarray as 
they argue over formation of a postwar government 
he indicated the guerrillas failure to form a cohesive 
alternative to the kabul regime may cost it its credibility in the 
crucial months ahead 
i dont believe the international community will respond to the 
new government very quickly matinuddin said 
gilani gave an account of the military situation in afghanistan 
on the last day of the soviet withdrawal among other points he 
said 
all cities with strategic or psychological importance were 
under guerrilla siege 
the important airports were within attacking range of the 
guerrillas 
all major highways were at least partially interrupted by the 
guerrillas 
kabul was relatively calm 
there was a rising trend in defections by communist troops to 
the resistance

sudans government has invited un relief 
officials to khartoum next month to begin planning ways to prevent 
mass starvation during the rainy season officials said wednesday 
its a meeting that is looking at a potential tragedy and we 
want to find practical solutons to avoid it said charleshenri la 
muniere a senior un official working on the sudan relief project 
the conference is planned for march 89 and will be led by unicef 
director james p grant and undersecretarygeneral abdulrahim a 
farah said un spokesman francois giuliani 
private relief agencies will be contacted shortly to join the 
effort said la muniere 
unless food is delivered throughout the sudan to about 4 million 
people displaced by rebellion drought and famine before the rainy 
season begins in may hundreds of thousands of people may starve 
its a race against time said la muniere weve got to 
beat the devil at his game on this one the donor community is 
solidly behind this 
the united states and other western nations are pressuring the 
sudanese government of prime minister sadek mahdi to improve food 
distribution and other aid to all sections of his country 
madhis government has often cited the rebellion by the sudan 
peoples liberation army as posing too great a danger for relief 
flights and convoys in the south 
the government has allowed little aid to reach the rebelheld 
south where about 500000 people died of starvation last year the 
rebellion broke out in 1983 over demands for greater automony and 
economic reforms 
the southern provinces of bahr ghazal upper nile and equatoria 
are mainly christian and animist and resent being ruled by the 
predominantly islamic governing elite in the north 
during the past year the rebels have become more cooperative due 
to limited negotiations with some elements of mahdis government 
said un officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
relief flights organized by the world food program the red 
cross unicef and the un development program have been allowed by 
the rebels to land in cities in the south where peasant farmers 
have fled to escape the guerrilla war 
distributing food throughout the country before the rainy season 
will require truck convoys and shipments by train said un 
officials

heart by weakening the bodys muscles according to a new study 
researchers concluded that people risk muscle damage if their 
lifetime consumption of pure alcohol is more than 13 kilograms for 
each kilogram of body weight this is the equivalent of a 150pound 
man drinking more than 12 ounces of whiskey a day for 20 years 
doctors long assumed that weakness among heavy drinkers a 
condition called chronic alcoholic myopathy resulted from 
malnutrition because alcoholics often eat poorly 
however the new study found that such muscle wasting including 
weakness of the heart muscle was also common among alcoholics who 
lived in stable homes and ate well 
the study was conducted on 50 alcoholic men by dr alvaro 
urbanomarquez and colleagues from the university of barcelona in 
spain the results were published in thursdays new england journal 
of medicine 
they found that onethird of the alcoholics had weakness of the 
heart muscle and nearly half had abnormalities in other muscles 
an accompanying editorial by dr ivan diamond of the university 
of california san francisco called the spanish study important 
he said it shows that a large lifetime dose of ethanol 
alcohol determines the prevalence and severity of damage to 
cardiac and skeletal muscle in alcoholism

the state department is still reviewing an 
offer made last month by a group of american businessmen to purchase 
the partially built us embassy in moscow but the proposal could 
pose some difficulties officials said wednesday 
the united states has halted construction on the eightstory 
embassy because it was found to have been riddled with soviet 
listening devices while the soviets were building it 
last year thenpresident reagan recommended that the building be 
razed and rebuilt 
but last month a trade group headed by dwayne o andreas one of 
the nations richest men and chairman of archer daniels midland co 
offered to buy the building for use as business offices 
andreas is also cochairman of the usussr trade and 
economic council which has tried to promote more trade between the 
two superpowers he made the offer on behalf of a consortium of us 
companies which would use the building as a moscow headquarters 
state department spokesman charles e redman asked about a 
report that us officials had found the andreas proposal to be the 
most expensive of several options for dealing with the building 
said wednesday that all of the options were still under study 
including the proposal from the businessmen 
secretary of state james a baker iii is expected to send a 
recommendation to president bush once the indepth review of 
those options is complete redman said the spokesman said he was 
not aware of any deadline for completion of the study 
joseph s hulings the coordinator of embassy problem in the 
departments management bureau said his office was still 
evaluating the businessmens offer 
hulings said he could estimate off the top of my head that it 
might cost 25 percent more to sell the building to the businessmen 
and build a new embassy 
that is because the foundation of the unfinished building 
contains some of the electrical water and other facilities for the 
surrounding living quarters of the us diplomats and their 
families and if a new building were built at a different site new 
utilities would be required 
the soviets would have to approve any sale because the building 
was intended for use as a new embassy built under a 1972 agreement 
between the two countries 
another problem arises because under the agreement the soviets 
cannot occupy their new facility in washington until the us 
embassy in moscow is ready if us businessmen occupied the moscow 
building the soviets might seek to take over their completed 
chancery in washington 
although the united states has informally discussed the proposal 
with the soviets no reply has been received from them and until 
they reply no formal cost estimate can be drawn up hulings added 
the united states has filed claims against the soviets for 29 
million in connection with what the united states claims are defects 
and delays in the construction those claims must be negotiated by 
an arbitration panel in stockholm sweden 
the existence of bugs in the structure became widely known in 
1986 under the 1972 construction agreement a soviet 
governmentowned construction firm was permitted to build the 
american embassy

a flurry of shootings overnight including 
three killings accelerated demands wednesday for tougher action to 
stem rising violence in the nations capital 
no mayor anywhere could be more unhappy about this situation 
than me mayor marion s barry jr said at his monthly news 
conference if i had the solutions for these killings at my 
fingertips id stop them its frightening its sad that weve 
come to this point 
said barry obviously meeting in the community is not enough 
marches arent enough sending hundreds of police officers out isnt 
enough were in an epidemic around america 
paramedics responded to 14 reports of shootings in the city 
tuesday 11 of them between 630 pm and midnight according to 
twyla geraci a spokeswoman for the dc ambulance service five of 
the 14 ended up being false calls or people refusing treatment she 
didnt know whether other shootings might have occurred without 
ambulance calls 
the three slayings combined with the death tuesday of a 
teenager who was shot in the head the previous night raised the 
total of lives taken in the first 45 days of 1989 to 75 compared to 
46 at the same time in 1988 the total for all of last year was 372 
a record for the city 
the dead tuesday night were identified as anthony bailey and 
derrick bell both 25 and darnell wells 26 according to officer 
walter ferguson a spokesman for the metropolitan police department 
he identified the teenager as habib mathis 15 all four were from 
suburban maryland 
nearby but not included in the dc toll a gunman described as a 
disgruntled employee killed three women and then himself at the 
office of a savings bank in suburban bethesda md on wednesday 
police and mayor barry have blamed drugs for most of the recent 
homicides in the district of columbia 
obviously these are targeted murders barry said they are 
not random killings these are assassinations drug dealers killing 
one another 
the mayor said city residents neednt fear for their lives 
downtown washington is safe and a lot of our neighborhoods are 
safe washington is not dodge city the mayor said though last 
year police chief maurice turner said the number and variety of 
weapons seized on the citys streets reminded him of something out 
of the wild wild west 
though blaming drugs for the violence barry two months ago 
drastically curtailed operation clean sweep the police departments 
program targeting street drug sales 
at his news conference he promised a major announcement on new 
crime fighting strategies by next monday 
since budget problems will prevent barry from hiring many new 
officers some police officials predict the city will try to deal 
with the crime wave by moving officers from safer neighborhoods into 
drugplagued sections 
but council members called for more drastic action 
councilman hr crawford renewed his call for the national guard 
to patrol notorious drug markets 
barry has opposed such a move saying the city can handle its own 
problems 
it just says to me that we need to apply tougher standards 
across the board when it comes to dealing with this councilman 
james nathanson said we cannot let this continue 
the mayor said legislation instituting the death penalty in the 
district of columbia isnt the answer 
we have a death penalty already 70 percent of last years 
murders were assassinations and those count as executions barry 
said thats an unjust system but if thats not keeping people 
from killing one another im not sure a just system would

nato allies are urging washington to launch a 
comprehensive arms control initiative or risk of allowing soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev to take charge of the eastwest agenda 
a senior us official said wednesday 
the official briefed reporters aboard the plane of secretary of 
state james a baker iii as baker moved into the final phase of his 
tour of nato capitals 
the us official said said gorbachev was getting credit from the 
west european public for arms reductions and human rights advances 
that were pressed on him by the united states 
there are potential opportunities for us to launch 
initiatives to reduce longrange nuclear weapons arsenals slow 
the proliferation of ballistic missiles in troubled areas of the 
world and curb chemical weapons the official said on condition of 
anonymity 
there are real problems that threaten to make the whole 
environment a lot more dangerous he said if the soviets really 
have new thinking and we think they may these are good areas for 
us to be both probing and challenging 
he said that if the west led by the united states does not take 
charge and deal with that reality gorbachevs agenda will 
become one that is much more prominent and we will have to respond 
to gorbachevs agenda rather than have him respond to ours 
bakers eightday trip is designed primarily to solicit the views 
of the allies as the bush administration tries to formulate new 
foreign policy initiatives 
in the meantime resumption of us negotiations with the soviets 
to reduce strategic nuclear weapons has been postponed indefinitely 
baker made stops wednesday in spain and portugal meeting in 
madrid with spanish prime minister felipe gonzales and foreign 
minister francisco fernandezordonez and in lisbon with portuguese 
prime minister anibal cavaco silva and foreign minister joao de dues 
pinheiro 
baker then flew to brussels for meetings thursday with belgian 
and nato officials later thursday he will stop in luxembourg and 
the netherlands he flies home friday 
in a brief exchange with reporters in madrid baker marked the 
final pullout of soviet troops from afghanistan with an appeal to 
moscow to contribute to rehabilitating that country 
he called the soviet military intervention which began in 
december 1979 a tragic chapter in afghanistans history

a fairbanks radio station escaped tuesday from its crate in a 
garage near the national zoo while the woman was visiting relatives 
kristina harper chief of animal disease control for the citys 
department of human services said we have no reason to think

through a wooden crate said glenner anderson program director of 
kwlf in fairbanks he said dawn maddox of fairbanks had raised the 
2yearold wolf as a pet since its birth alongside her two children 
its extremely friendly but is quite timid said anderson 
its probably got its tail between its legs and its running 
around somewhere or hiding somewhere its going to be hard to catch 
because its scared around people 
the wolf won a contest eight months ago seeking a mascot for the 
radio station and has been on an east coast tour promoting the 
station 
ms harper said her agency had received no calls from people 
sighting the animal 
she described the animal as mostly black with a little bit of 
brown in its mane and some white on its back and haunches it has 
amber eyes and was wearing a choke collar

a quick 10word memory test developed by 
researchers to help identify alzheimers patients in early stages of 
the brain disorder has won praise from the american medical 
association 
the test which takes less than 10 minutes seems to be a 
brief efficient and accurate means of predicting alzheimers in 
elderly patients the ama said in a statement 
the university of minnesota researchers who developed the test 
report that it is 952 percent accurate in distinguishing elderly 
people with early signs of alzheimers disease from those with no 
sign of mental impairment 
the test makes use of findings by other researchers one of those 
findings is that people with alzheimers forget things within 
minutes of learning them and that attempts to improve their memory 
do not significantly help 
other researchers also have found that normal elderly people 
forget at a much slower pace and are helped appreciably by memory 
improvement strategies 
alzheimers patients lose their ability to encode things store 
them for easy retrieval dr soren ryberg said tuesday ryberg 
and dr david knopman reported their test in this months archives 
of neurology journal 
alzheimers is a progressive irreversible disorder with no known 
cause or cure it is characterized by memory loss disorientation 
and personality changes 
ryberg in an experiment gave 55 patients thought to be normal 
and 28 thought to have alzheimers the same series of 10 common 
words he asked them to use each word in a sentence twice both 
groups ranged in age from 65 to 85 
ryberg said creating a sentence is a way of encoding a word in 
the brain something studies indicate alzheimers patients do poorly 
after five minutes he asked the participants to recite as many 
of the words as they could he suggested they jog their memories by 
trying to recall the sentences 
most of the alzheimers patients were able to recall no more than 
two of the words the average was less than one word per patient on 
average the normal elderly recalled about six of the 10 words 
ryberg said 
ryberg said the conclusion is that a score of zero to two is 
strongly suggestive of alzheimers or some similar dementia and 
three is just suggestive 
he said that knopman an associate professor of neurology 
confirmed the alzheimers diagnosis as much as possible by ruling 
out other likely causes such as stroke depressed function of the 
thyroid gland or low levels of vitamin b12 
you still have to say possible or probable because its a 
clinical diagnosis based on symptoms he said its not until 
autopsy that you can be absolutely positive of the diagnosis

ljubljana yugoslavia ap the first fullfledged opposition 
party to be established in yugoslavia since the communist takeover 
in 1946 says it will hold its founding convention in this regional 
capital on thursday 
the slovenian social democratic union published its program in 
wednesdays issue of the liberal mladina youth weekly which said 
the party will strive for a peaceful transition from the countrys 
singleparty communist system to a system based on westernstyle 
parliamentary democracy 
it will also work for establishment of independent trade unions 
in yugoslavia and for legalization of the right to strike according 
to the program 
authorities in slovenia yugoslavias most liberal republic have 
demonstrated an unprecedented degree of tolerance by allowing the 
establishment up of alternative political cultural ecological and 
other groups 
the first autonomous political group here the slovenian 
democratic union was formed in ljubljana on jan 11 it agreed to 
operate within the framework of the socialist alliance a 
communistled mass organization 
but the social democratic union rejected any cooperation with the 
alliance as long as it is led by the communist party the partys 
leading founder france tomsic told the associated press 
the social democratic union will strive for parliamentary 
democracy since the social democratic program has been a part of 
political life in most progressive and developed european countries 
for more than 100 years tomsic said 
yugoslav communist leaders repeatedly have denounced the idea of 
introducing a multiparty system claiming the parties would be 
formed on ethnic lines and lead to tensions and even fratricidal 
clashes among the countrys patchwork of six republics and two 
provinces 
zoran polic a hardline member of slovenias communist 
leadership was quoted wednesday by the press as saying formation of 
the social democratic union should be decisively prevented 
authorities thwarted previous efforts to set up independent 
political parties in yugoslavia but preparations for holding the 
founding convention in a convention hall in ljubljana continued 
despite the official criticism

conduct a fullscale environmental impact study of its plan to build 
a radio transmitter complex in an ecologically sensitive area near 
warren grove nj 
the complex dubbed the northeast regional communications 
facility is designed to guarantee international communications in 
the event of war or other national emergency supplementing the 
satellite links used now 
last november the air force informed local officials it intended 
to proceed with the project under a national security justification 
without performing an environmental impact study 
but local residents new jersey gov thomas h kean and the 
states congressional delegation all have expressed opposition or 
concern over the plan prompting the air force to reconsider the 
matter 
the air force will begin preparation of the environmental 
impact statement in the near future the service said wednesday in 
a brief statement 
there will be opportunities for public involvement in the 
process which will be announced at the appropriate times 
the air force was named to build and operate the facility by the 
defense communications agency and wants to use a 43acre site now 
owned by the federal aviation administration in warren grove in 
the heart of the pine barrens 
the pine barrens is an ecologically sensitive wilderness area 
that harbors a variety of endangered plants and wildlife it has 
been designated a national reserve since 1978 
more than a dozen radio towers would be constructed at the faa 
site which is located about 20 miles southeast of mcguire air force

the us and british transportation secretaries 
appealed wednesday for better security practices to make 
international air travel safe from terrorists 
they addressed the 33member council of the international civil 
aviation organization at the opening of a twoday meeting the united 
states and britain requested after a bomb blew up a pan am jetliner 
dec 21 over scotland 
samuel k skinner of the united states said no one country or 
carrier should have to stand alone in matters of security it is 
only by joining together in the finest traditions of icao that we 
can secure international civil aviation from acts of terrorism 
paul channon the british secretary told the council members 
we meet today because the list of such disasters has grown too 
long 
he noted the attack on pan am flight 103 which killed 259 people 
on the plane and 11 on the ground and the bombings in flight of an 
air india flight in 1985 and a korean airways jet in 1987 
those attending the meeting said bomb attacks on planes must be 
considered a phenomenon to be fought much as international 
cooperation helped reduce the number of aircraft hijackings after 
they became epidemic 
among suggested neasures are increased screening of passengers 
and carryon baggage more thorough screening of checked baggage 
pairing passengers with checked baggage and better screening of 
cargo and mail 
others include faster development and installation of screening 
technology tighter control of access to strategic areas and the 
possibility of limiting carryon radios computers and other 
electronic devices in which explosives are difficult to detect 
channon asked the council for a unanimous decision that the 
time has come to take vigorous action to review existing provisions 
and examine the need for new ones to improve our common defenses 
against the scourge of sabotage which has taken such a hideous toll 
of innocent life in the past four years 
us airlines have taken more stringent security measures since 
the pan am bombing but officials said air terrorism can be 
controlled only through international measures 
we are dealing with terrorists who can and will strike 
anywhere channon said only concerted action by all icaos 
member states can give air travelers and air crews confidence in 
their security 
the organization is a un agency and 160 countries are members

the city agreed wednesday to a oneweek delay 
in its ban on possession of assault rifles while a federal judge 
decides whether he has jurisdiction in colt industries lawsuit 
challenging the new law 
the citys ban on the sale of the rapidfire weapons will remain 
in effect however while the lawsuit filed monday by colt 
industries inc is considered 
the city council on feb 7 banned the sale of semiautomatic 
weapons including colts ar15 the ak47 and the uzi the law also 
bars possession of such guns after feb 22 unless they have been 
modified so they cannot fire 
new yorkbased colt makers of the legendary colt 45caliber 
revolver and the ar15 a civilian version of the militarys m16 
contends in its lawsuit that the law will harm the companys 
finances and its image 
a court hearing was postponed wednesday because of the 
jurisdiction issue 
by making one of our firearms illegal by specifying in an 
ordinance that its an apparently bad or unuseful weapon not 
intended for sporting is bad for our reputation colt attorney 
harry g melkonian said after the wednesdays court session 
colt is making a fine and precision weapon and firearm used for 
target shooting and competition its a sporting rifle and not a 
saturday night special were really offended that were thrown into 
this category he said 
city officials said colt was ignorant of the dangers of firearms 
in los angeles there were 452 gangrelated slaying in los angeles 
county in 1988 most of which were committed with guns and many with 
semiautomatic weapons 
guns sales have become an emotional issue statewide since a 
schoolyard massacre jan 17 in stockton in northern california a 
gunman using a ak47 assault rifle killed five children and wounded 
29 other students and a teacher 
obviously the colt executives dont walk the streets of los 
angeles and experience the violence we have here said councilman 
zev yaroslavsky who introduced the ordinance 
about 30 states including california are considering some sort 
of control or ban on semiautomatic weapons 
us district judge william gray delayed a hearing on colts 
request to issue a temporary restraining order to block the 
ordinance 
gray said he must decide if he has jurisdiction in colts lawsuit 
or if it should be sent to state court he scheduled a hearing for 
feb 22 
city attorneys agreed that enforcement of the possession ban 
would be suspended until march 1 pending the outcome of the next 
hearing before gray 
were very pleased with the results melkonian said as far 
as were concerned this is the beginning of the end of this 
ordinance 
city attorney james hahn predicted otherwise were going to 
prevail in this issue what happened today keeps our ban against 
sales in effect he said 
colt industries wants the ordinance barred on grounds that it 
illegally preempts state law regarding the sale and possession of 
weapons and would force a hardship on the company 
deputy city attorney byron boeckman said he would argue that 
state law does not bar cities from regulating weapons 
we contend the state never said we cant regulate the use or 
possession of most weapons it is not a matter of statewide concern 
but of local concern boeckman said 
according to the lawsuit colt shipped more than 100000 worth 
of the rifles and other firearms to the los angeles area just prior 
to enactment of the ordinance which prohibits dealers and retailers 
from receiving them 
they must either break sales contracts with colt or be in 
criminal violation the suit contends

oliver norths irancontra trial appeared to 
get back on track wednesday as prosecutors after meeting with 
justice department lawyers issued guidelines designed to guard 
against disclosures of classified material by north 
in a fourparagraph statement independent counsel lawrence walsh 
said he will if necessary seek an affidavit from attorney general 
dick thornburgh to prevent the disclosure of classified information 
which could harm national security 
the statement was worked out with thornburgh who said it will 
permit national security secrets to be protected 
hours after the announcement thornburgh asked the supreme court 
to lift the stay that has delayed the start of the trial and said he 
will also drop his appeal of rulings by us district court judge 
gerhard a gesell on secrecy issues chief justice william rehnquist 
had issued the administrative stay at the justice departments 
request 
walshs statement was in response to an order issued tuesday by 
gesell who told thornburgh to stay out of the north case barring 
the attorney general from filing affidavits in bits and pieces 
in response to individual documents or testimony planned by north 
gesell said walsh will be recognized as responsible for the 
daytoday conduct of this case 
norths attorney brendan sullivan was not immediately available 
for comment 
thornburgh in a statement endorsed the plan the independent 
counsels planned implementation of yesterdays district court order 
provides the government with the substance of what we have been 
seeking for the past week 
i am pleased that a mechanism has been developed that will 
permit the trial to go forward while ensuring that i can fulfill the 
responsibility imposed upon me by the congress to protect the 
national security interests of the united states thornburgh said 
walshs statement also says walsh will notify thornburgh if 
evidence in any of eight specific categories is to be introduced 
those categories include information identifying undercover cia 
officers and information revealing locations of cia stations and 
us covert activities other than paramilitary support for the 
contras also included are details about specific cia operations 
with foreign intelligence services and government officials as well 
as information identifying by name or description foreigners who are 
cia assets or liaison officials 
if the attorney general by affidavit states that the evidence 
in the eight categories is such a threat to national security that 
it can not be introduced independent counsel will accept this 
statement as a statement by the administration and ask the court to 
take appropriate action said walsh 
if the attorney general by affidavit states that the evidence 
in the eight categories is such a threat to national security that 
it can not be introduced independent counsel will accept this 
statement as a statement by the administration and ask the court to 
take appropriate action said walsh 
walsh also said he will of course object to any classified 
information not previously designated by north as being part of 
the evidence he plans to introduce at trial 
walshs statement differs from gesells order of tuesday in one 
respect gesells order says walsh may prevent the introduction of 
classified information through the section of the classified 
information procedures act dealing with affidavits 
walsh however said he doesnt have the power to file an 
affidavit under the section of cipa permitting the barring of 
classified information damaging to the national security 
but walsh said he can ask thornburgh to file an affidavit if it 
becomes necessary and after the court has rejected other 
alternatives such as summarizing or censoring the classified 
material 
gesell said tuesday he wont let thornburgh chop up the case 
with a series of affidavits barring disclosure of information each 
time north tried to introduce evidence the government found 
objectionable 
decisions on possible challenges to classified information will 
be left to walsh gesell said 
concerns over classified material that north wanted to use in his 
defense erupted feb 8 the justice department sought a court order 
that would have barred the fired white house aide from disclosing 
any classified material without a court ruling that it is admissible 
and as long as there is an objection to its release pending from the 
government 
north faces 12 criminal charges he is accused of allegedly 
concealing from congress in 1985 and 1986 his efforts on behalf of 
the nicaraguan contras and of covering up from the attorney general 
the national security councils role in diverting money from the 
iran arms sales to the contras 
north also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue 
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the contras

nicaraguan rebel leaders 
wednesday criticized the central american summit agreement that 
would dismantle their movement and they insisted they must be 
included in negotiating their own future 
leaders of the guerrillas known as contras also said they felt 
abandoned by the united states which one called a bad ally not a 
trustworthy ally 
the agreement announced tuesday by five central american 
presidents calls for disbanding the contra guerrillas and for early 
elections in nicaragua but the presidents still face two major 
tasks getting the rebels and their us sponsors to go along with 
the accords and verifying nicaraguan compliance 
a lot of people put themselves out on a limb by signing this 
contra leader adolfo calero said wednesday 
presidents daniel ortega of nicaragua jose azcona hoyo of 
honduras oscar arias of costa rica vinicio cerezo of guatemala and 
jose napoleon duarte of el salvador said they agreed to develop a 
plan within 90 days to demobilize and dismantle the 11000strong 
contra army 
ortega also promised to advance national and local elections from 
november 1990 to february of that year and open the electoral 
process to the opposition he said he would permit united nations 
observers but the presidents were unable to agree on a verification 
procedure 
the two major components of the accord were presented as 
unilateral agreements nicaraguas promise to hold elections does 
not formally depend on what happens to the contras although 
sandinista spokesmen made it clear they expect the contras to be 
gone by the time electoral reform begins 
neither the united states nor the rebels are parties to the 
accord although neither rejected it outright 
we are neither rejecting nor enthusiastically promoting this 
action calero said 
the accord left the contras isolated diplomatically and 
psychologically in central america but it was not known what would 
happen if the rebels refuse to go along with the plan to dismantle 
their camps 
an estimated 11000 fighters and several thousand family members 
are in honduras along the border with nicaragua many of them vowing 
to fight on they ran out of ammunition and moved into the camps 
after the united states suspended military aid last february 
the honduran army would have a difficult time ejecting the 
battlehardened guerrillas by force and honduras fears ending us 
humanitarian aid would leave a hungry horde on the loose 
we are well and alive contra spokesman bosco matamoros 
insisted during the summit we are a very real ghost 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman had no 
comment on the summit meeting except to say us officials will be 
interested in consulting with the four central american countries 
friendly to the united states 
he said no consultations with nicaragua are planned consistent 
with the reagan administrations policy of avoiding diplomatic 
contact with the sandinista government 
arias noted the importance of the us reaction after the summit 
ended 
it is the responsibility of the international community but 
above all of those who for many years sponsored the contras to 
find a solution to this problem arias told a news conference 
contra spokesmen were bitter toward the united states saying 
washington had abandoned them despite their sacrifices and the 8000 
dead they have suffered 
the us has not lived up to its responsibility to us to our 
dedication calero said 
the united states is a bad ally not a trustworthy ally said 
calero a softdrink distributor in prerevolutionary nicaragua 
but of bad allies it was the least bad 
matamoros said in a separate interview that if we had to do it 
over again we would look for support from china nationalist china 
or taiwan or some other reliable country 
calero said that whether it likes it or not the united states 
is deeply involved in whats happening and should monitor the 
accord using coercive force if need be to make sure the 
sandinistas live up to their promises 
the united states must either assume its responsibility or give 
us more military aid to keep going he said 
both the contras and president bush have said peace would come 
when nicaragua became a democracy contra military leader enrique 
bermudez said dismantling the contras would remove any incentive for 
democratization 
if we take these promises as the foundation if they serve to 
dismantle us then the sandinistas will be there forever he said 
the sandinistas clearly expect the contras to be gone before 
ortegas summit promise of open early elections is fully tested in 
february 1990 
the sandinistas said they were ready for democratic reform 
because the contras had been defeated both politically and 
militarily 
bermudez and calero said the rebels could resume their fight from 
nicaraguan soil if they are no longer welcome in honduras 
leaving honduras is one thing calero said dismantling is 
another 
calero estimated the cost of disbanding the contras at between 
150 million and 250 million and said the united states should take 
in former contras who want to live there 
like the vietnamese he said the us has done that before 
with abandoned allies

three years after the chernobyl nuclear disaster 
cancer rates have doubled among residents of a contaminated farm 
region and calves are being born without heads and limbs a 
newspaper said wednesday 
my daughter recently got married what kind of grandson will i 
have the weekly moscow news quoted one woman as saying 
it said authorities drastically underestimated the health 
problems caused by the reactor explosion and fire april 26 1986 
which sent a cloud of radiation around the world 
moscow news said more than half the children in the narodichsky 
region of the ukraine have illnesses of the thyroid gland which 
exposure to radiation can cause 
elevated levels of cesium 137 were detected among many residents 
of the region an agriculturally rich area which is within 30 miles 
of the chernobyl nuclear power plant and was not evacuated after the 
accident thirtyone people died as the immediate result of the 
disaster 
health officials of the republic insist there is no health 
danger for people outside a 30kilometer 19mile zone around the 
atomic power station moscow news said the danger zone was 
declared soon after the accident 
soviet officials have said repeatedly that radiation levels are 
safe except in the zone and generally have discounted warnings from 
some western doctors of dramatic increases to come in cancer and 
some other diseases 
the moscow news article was the second in the soviet press this 
month to suggest growing health problems because of chernobyl 
in a report feb 9 the official news agency tass said cancer and 
other diseases are increasing in byelorussia which is just north of 
the ukraine tass said authorities determined onefifth of the 
byelorussian republic was contaminated 
moscow news said lip mouth and other cancers doubled among 
residents of the narodichsky region since the accident 
it quoted veterinarian peter kudin of the petrovsky animal farm 
as saying 37 pigs and 27 calves were born with defects in the year 
after chernobyl and the numbers for the first nine months of 1988 
were 41 and 35 
the calves were frequently without heads limbs eyes or 
ribs the pigs goggleeyed or with deformed skulls he said kudin 
said only three defective pigs were born at the farm before the 
accident and no abnormal calves 
according to moscow news animals at the farm had been feeding on 
fields to which winds had carried radioactive particles 
clean meat and dairy products are brought to the region for 
residents but some who ignore warnings drink milk from local cows 
and pick fruit and vegetables from their gardens the newspaper said 
vladimir kolinko the moscow news correspondent who wrote the 
article said if the government is serious about its pledges to make 
things right residents would have the right to demand full 
compensation not to mention the right to full information about 
peoples health and the condition of the land

the ability of mental health workers to 
cope with sexual abuse is being questioned following the discovery 
that youngsters at a childrens psychiatric center had turned the 
place into a sexual playground 
a state investigation uncovered 64 instances of sexual activity 
involving 47 children from november 1987 to july 1988 at the western 
new york childrens psychiatric center the children most of them 
ages 5 to 12 had sex with each other while administrators looked 
the other way according to the report by the watchdog commission 
that investigated the facility in this buffalo suburb 
chairman clarence sundram said the panel determined that 
administrators considered the sexual activity normal and did nothing 
to stop it 
state mental health commissioner richard surles called the 
findings morally offensive and inexplicable he promised 
reforms at the facility and a review of the states four other child 
psychiatric hospitals 
experts in child abuse said the case has revealed an 
extraordinary inability of mental health workers to deal with sexual 
abuse 
jen henry an expert on treating sexually abused children who was 
brought in to assist the west seneca staff said sexual abuse has 
become a major topic of general concern only in the past 10 years 
the training of mental health professionals has not caught 
up said henry who noted that victims of sexual abuse can become 
child abusers as adults if they do not receive treatment 
for example she said most of the centers personnel who worked 
closely with the children had only associates degrees in social 
work and were not required to take courses on how to recognize 
sexual abuse 
the scandal was revealed only after the parents of an 8yearold 
who had been sodomized several times by his 12yearold roommate 
refused to accept administrators explanations that the behavior was 
normal 
the couple told police the boy had been disciplined for 
complaining about the situation police later confronted 
administrators 
we had to inform them that sex between children is a crime 
said lt allen scioli of the police juvenile division they were 
of the opinion there was nothing for the police to investigate 
after an initial police probe the state commission investigated 
thank god they the parents persisted and were able to bring 
their complaints to a place where could be dealt with sundram 
said 
the couple who had sent their son to the facility because he was 
hyperactive are suing the state 
several top administrators who have resigned or been reassigned 
have since acknowledged errors in judgment in not reporting the 
incidents 
c richard orndoff regional director of the state mental health 
department defended the staff 
it wasnt that they were callous or didnt care orndoff 
said they tried to address the problem clinically in group 
therapy and in counseling 
dr kathleen fowler a child abuse researcher at the university 
of michigan said most institutional health workers have little or 
no training in handling sexual incidents staff members often 
discount childrens accounts of sexual situations because youngsters 
sometimes tell stories to get attention 
but the stories are sometimes true said fowler who is 
investigating a case in a similar facility in michigan where a boy 
was sodomized by 14 others 
while sexual activity between children is definitely not 
normal it is not unusual for children who are the victims of 
sexual abuse to act out the abuse on each other she said she said 
it is up to administrators to check a childs background and be 
aware of possibly dangerous behavior patterns 
state officials estimate that up to 75 percent of the children 
that were at the west seneca facility may have been sexually abused 
among the revelations was that children at the facility formed a 
sex club variously called the gi joes or the transformers 
that required members to engage in oral and anal sex as an 
initiation rite

the vatican rebuked its radio station 
wednesday for some of its broadcasts to czechoslovakia apparently 
in hopes of resolving a dispute over the choice of roman catholic 
bishops in that communist country 
the nature of the broadcasts was not disclosed but vatican 
sources said they involved a report on a demonstration for religious 
freedom in bratislava last year and one about events in 
czechoslovakia at the end of world war ii 
spokesman joaquin navarro expressed the vatican position in a 
statement about a visit last month by vladimir janku the 
czechoslovak official in charge of church affairs 
in talks with archbishop francesco colasuonno special envoy to 
eastern europe for pope john paul ii janku complained of attacks 
on czechoslovakia in vatican radio programs navarro said 
he said the holy see confirmed its desire of arriving with 
czechoslovak authorities at a correct dialogue made with good will 
toward resolving the problems regarding the catholic church and in 
particular the nominations of bishops 
navarro said the two sides agreed the radio should keep its 
broadcasts about czechoslovakia in harmony with the holy sees 
attitudes toward that country 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said navarros 
statement would be broadcast back to czechoslovakia 
relations between the vatican and prague have been cool because 
of czechoslovakias intolerance toward believers and refusal to 
accept bishops who do not belong to the progovernment pacem in 
terris organization 
some improvement occurred last year with the approval of two 
auxiliary bishops for prague and an apostolic administrator in 
trnava but nine of the 13 sees still do not have catholic bishops

angry survivors of the 1984 gas disaster 
that killed more than 3300 people accused the indian government 
wednesday of settling too cheaply with union carbide corp 
as part of a settlement reached between union carbide and the 
indian government the supreme court of india on tuesday ordered the 
usbased multinational company to pay 470 million in compensation 
for the death and injury caused by the lethal cloud of gas that 
seeped out of a storage tank at the bhopal pesticide plant operated 
by its indian subsidiary 
we have often been promised money but for us it was more 
important that those who killed our brothers and sisters should be 
hanged said 15yearold sunil kumar whose parents and five 
brothers and sisters died in the worlds worst industrial disaster 
kumar and a younger brother still live in the hut in the jai 
prakash shantytown where they were asleep with the rest of their 
family when methyl isocyanate escaped from a storage tank in the 
union carbide plant across the street on dec 3 1984 
soon after the disaster the government awarded the boys about 
5833 it gave out 833 for each immediate family member who 
perished 
similar payments were made to relatives of hundreds of other 
victims but the major battle for compensation was waged in indian 
courts for four years in 1986 after us courts declined 
jurisdiction in the case the government of india sued union carbide 
for 3 billion 
tuesdays court decision for 470 million was received with anger 
by many survivors and the bhopal political activists who had 
espoused their cause 
we want justice a crowd of 200 women chanted wednesday 
outside government buildings in bhopal a city of 1 million people 
in central india 
the government has shaken hands with union carbide whose hands 
are dipped in the blood of our brothers and sisters one cried 
another woman reminded the crowd of the jan 6 executions of two 
sikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of prime minister indira 
gandhi two people were hanged for killing one woman she said 
no action was taken against those who killed thousands 
the crowd responded by chanting hang anderson it was a 
reference to warren anderson the chairman of union carbide at the 
time of the disaster 
the supreme court threw out all criminal charges pending in the 
case including one of culpable homicide against anderson 
more than 2000 people died almost immediately when the gas 
leaked from the plant operated by union carbide of india ltd 
deaths attributed to the gas continue at the rate of at least one 
a day according to the government of madhya pradesh state the toll 
has reached at least 3329 
more than 20000 people are still listed as gas victims 
suffering from shortness of breath eye problems and other ailments 
the indian government and the danbury connbased union carbide 
came close to an outofcourt settlement in november 1987 for 
about 500 million 30 million more than this weeks courtordered 
payment 
to many in bhopal tuesdays agreement smacked of collusion 
this shameless settlement shows that the multinationals have 
not just the support of the indian government but also of the 
highest court in the land said alok pratap singh a leader of the 
poisonous gas episode struggle front 
attorneys for the government and union carbide said the 
settlement was fair and just and it would enable compensation to be 
given to the victims 
there has been no word on how the funds would be distributed 
in 1987 a tentative plan was drawn up to pay compensation to 
relatives of the dead and to gasaffected survivors in addition 
continuing free medical care would have been provided disabled 
survivors many of them manual laborers no longer able to perform 
physically taxing jobs would have been retrained for new work and 
restitution would have been made for business and environmental 
losses including dead livestock 
on wednesday the supreme court said union carbide and its indian 
subsidiary must pay the 470 million by march 23 instead of by 
march 31 as ordered tuesday this was done because indias fiscal 
year ends march 31 
the court wednesday also agreed to a proposal by union carbide 
that its indian subsidiary pay part of the settlement 
union carbide corp will be responsible for 425 million of the 
settlement the court said it will have to pay only 420 million 
because of a 5 million emergency payment the company made in 1985 
under orders from a us court 
the subsidiary union carbide of india ltd must pay the 
remaining 45 million union carbide corp owns 509 percent of the 
indian subsidary indian shareholders including government 
institutions have the remaining 491 percent 
this division should enable the parent company to make payment 
without financial complications it has already set aside 200 
million for the settlement and has insurance covering an additional 
250 million according to james wilbur a vice president with smith 
barney harris upham and co inc in new york 
the indian subsidiary said wednesday it would meet its obligation 
primarily through the sale of a chemical and plastic plant in bombay

an investigation found no criminal wrongdoing 
or negligence by police officers in the death of a suspected drug 
dealer that touched off two nights of disturbances prosecutors said 
wednesday 
the hillsborough state attorneys office concluded that the feb 
1 asphyxiation of edgar allen price who was black was accidental 
assistant state attorney john skye said 
two officers were put on administrative leave while prosecutors 
reviewed the case amid racial sensitivities heightened by three 
nights of rioting last month in miami sparked by the fatal police 
shooting of a black motorcyclist 
police chief austin c mclane said he was not surprised that no 
charges were filed he said his officers properly restrained the 
battling price with handcuffs and leg ropes 
a police department internal review of the officers actions has 
not yet been completed and was not expected for a couple of weeks 
eight police officers subdued the 6foot3 300pound price in a 
violent struggle after an informant made a crack cocaine buy in 
college hill a predominantly black housing development 
the officers hogtied the 40yearold price and placed him face 
down in the back seat of a police cruiser authorities said 
before paramedics could arrive to tend to a cut on the suspects 
head rock and bottlethrowing erupted an officer drove the patrol 
car to a parking lot a couple blocks away where police noticed 
price was having trouble breathing he died at a hospital two hours 
later 
the medical examiners office said the restraint following the 
exertion of the struggle figured into prices death 
by being placed in a limited space with the head face down into 
the back seat associated with limited activity from being handcuffed 
and restrained the necessary conditions for producing an asphyxial 
death existed dr charles diggs associate hillsborough medical 
examiner said in a report released friday 
diggs said the way price was manacled is normally relatively 
innocuous police said the medical examiners report showed that 
price was not beaten or choked to death by officers 
at least 10 people were arrested in the two nights of 
disturbances and five officers received minor injuries a grocery 
store was looted and torched 
price served 11 years of a 50year prison sentence in texas for 
attempted murder of a houston police officer and a string of 
robberies he was paroled in 1984 and came to tampa in 1986 police 
said his girlfriend said price worked as a longdistance trucker 
and laborer 
arvida marion grandmother of prices girlfriend who was in her 
house when price and a band of officers came crashing in said she 
believed prosecutors never had any intention of filing charges 
id knew they wouldnt do nothing to those cops ms marion 
told the tampa tribune but youll be hearing from me again this 
aint over yet 
they didnt need to tie him like a wild horse she said 
police reported streets in the college hill area were quiet early 
wednesday night and no extra patrols were called out said officer

it were put off and security and antifraud conditions were met 
they had rejected as a farce the previous five national 
elections this decade 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena is 
favored to win the march election it is staunchly against any 
postponement which would have to be approved unanimously by all 
parties 
the bomb that ripped apart an opposition unions offices on 
wednesday also damaged six nearby homes 
humberto centeno a leader in the national union of salvadoran 
workers said the selfproclaimed maximiliano hernandez martinez

exterminates communists and those groups and people who help the 
farabundo marti national liberation front 
when us vice president dan quayle was in el salvador earlier 
this month he complained about the reemergence of death squads 
the new group takes its name from hernandez martinez a 
conservative salvadoran president from 193244 
the rebel radio venceremos said troops of the elite atlacatl 
battalion attacked the field hospital monday it said the three 
women killed two nurses and a mexican doctor also were raped

a union leader said wednesday he wont advise 
uranium plant workers to stay off the job despite a decision by us 
and ohio environmental protection agencies to keep inspectors away 
over safety concerns 
david day president of the 14union fernald atomic trades and 
labor council said he sees no reason for workers to stay away from 
the governmentowned uranium processing plant 
the us and ohio environmental protection agencies announced 
tuesday that they have barred their inspectors from the feed 
materials production center after two people were contaminated with 
uranium 
day described himself as surprised but not shocked that 
meeting areas at the 38yearold plant in the fernald community 
might be contaminated 
he said the union coalition repeatedly has alleged that 
urinalysis tests by the plant operator and the us department of 
energy on uraniumexposed workers are unreliable 
we dont think we can trust the results of those tests and the 
doe takes too long to give us results day said 
the energy department plant on 1050 acres 18 miles northwest of 
cincinnati processes uranium for the departments production 
elsewhere of nuclear weapons westinghouse materials co of ohio 
operates the plant for the energy department 
inspector catherine mccord a chicagobased federal environmental 
protection agency inspector said her contamination was through 
either inhalation or ingestion 
she said she would return to the plant after it is satisfactorily 
cleaned up its my job ms mccord said 
ms mccord is overseeing the plants cleanup which is projected 
as a 10year 5 billion program to remove surface uranium 
contamination thousands of drums and thousands of tons of 
contaminated wastes in pits from the plant site 
ohio gov richard celeste in a statement said he was alarmed 
that the federal government has had to pull its inspectors from 
fernald because of unsafe working conditions it is time for the 
federal government to live up to its responsibility to operate a 
safe plant 
the epa inspectors were contaminated by radioactive uranium in 
middecember while attending meetings according to a feb 9 letter 
to the energy department from valdas adamkus us epa regional 
administrator in chicago 
as of today us epa personnel and contractors will not be 
going to the us doe fernald site until this health risk can be 
satisfactorily addressed adamkus letter said 
lisa crawford spokeswoman for the citizens group fernald 
residents for environmental safety and health said wednesday she 
found the epas announcement frightening 
i just think it lends credit to what weve been saying all 
along that there is a problem there and something needs to be done 
about it i think the epa made a valid choice mrs crawford said 
her group has filed a 300 million lawsuit in us district court 
in cincinnati against the plants former operator national lead of 
ohio inc the group alleges the plant contaminated the environment 
created a health hazard and ruined values of neighboring properties 
judge s arthur spiegel ruled this week that the lawsuit filed 
as a classaction on behalf of 14000 people living within five 
miles of the plant can proceed to trial june 5 
westinghouse officials questioned the energy department test and 
said they are also seeking an independent evaluation tests of plant 
workers have shown no unusual problems and westinghouse considers 
its laboratory examinations reliable company spokesman william h 
kelley said

chicago a former watergate prosecutor unleashed her clout over 
the death of a beloved dog with her former personal lawyer named 
special prosecutor to go after the veterinarian who tended her pet 
the vets lawyers say 
hearings by the professional regulation department have been 
scheduled against mell wostoupal after former prosecutor jill 
winebanks filed a complaint against the veterinarian over treatment 
of her dog finnegan 
ms winebanks is executive vice president of the american bar 
association and a former deputy illinois attorney general 
lawyer ken ross who had been gathering information for a 
possible lawsuit against the veterinarian last month was named by 
the attorney generals office to handle the licensing case ms 
winebanks acknowledged the appointment was at her suggestion but 
says she sees no conflict 
the general counsel for the regulation department said wednesday 
the appointment by a special prosecutor was rare and was made by the 
attorney generals office 
at issue is the death in december 1987 of finnegan a 7yearold 
dalmatian owned by ms winebanks and her husband michael banks 
an autopsy found a fibrous substance blocking finnegans 
intestines was the cause of death 
ms winebanks says when she and her husband took the dog to 
wostoupal he said finnegan had just eaten some leaves 
the animal died several days after he was stricken with symptoms 
that included vomiting and a loss of appetite 
angry about wostoupals diagnosis ms winebanks sought 
revocation of his license the regulation agency issued a formal 
complaint and scheduled hearings 
the veterinarians lawyers john huston and glen crick say the 
appointment of a special prosecutor is outrageous and that rosss 
appointment places him in violation of legal ethics 
the case arises from the same facts and circumstances in which 
he privately represents the complaining witnesses they said 
ken represents the state now he is going to pursue this to 
protect the pet owners of illinois said ms winebanks a 
prosecutor in the watergate burglary coverup revealed after 
president nixons 1972 reelection campaign 
she said she suggested ross for the job after they became 
frustrated that finnegans case wasnt moving fast enough 
i did what any citizen should do i went to the state i have 
faith that the system will work ms winebanks said 
i dont know that jill used clout my guess is she used a 
little yelling and screaming said spokeswoman jeanne marie 
schultz in the office of illinois attorney general neil hartigan 
ms winebanks said regulation department officials concurred in 
rosss appointment but michael accettura general counsel for the 
agency said they had no say 
the attorney generals office has the power to tell us ross was 
our man accettura said in a telephone interview wednesday 
michael j hayes deputy attorney general said he approved ross 
hiring for the case jan 25 after the regulations agency agreed to 
pay his fee 
ross said the department will pay him 160 an hour 
accettura agreed the appointment of special prosecutors in such 
cases is rare but refused to comment on the alleged conflict of 
interest 
thats for the attorney general to decide they appointed this 
individual he said 
accettura said hearings before the departments veterinarian 
board are scheduled for next month the agency director will decide 
the matter 
board members will decide whether a violation occurred or not 
and what penalty should apply a twomonth suspension or 
whatever accettura said they make a recommendation and the 
director acts on it

a judge has suspended the trial of 
two indian chiefs and a american who were charged with criticizing 
brazil during a trip to the united states an official said 
wednesday 
federal judge milton luiz pereira on tuesday halted the trial of 
american darrell posey and chiefs kubei and paulo paiakan because 
of unsound accusations and a lack of just cause claudia de 
oliveira an official in the federal appeals court said by 
telephone from brasilia 
kubei and paiakan both of the kayapo tribe and posey 41 a 
native of henderson ky and an expert on tropical insects were 
accused of breaking brazils foreigners law during a trip last year 
to the united states where they denounced the white mans 
encroachment upon indian lands in brazil 
brazilian law prohibits foreigners from making political 
statements or interfering in the countrys legal affairs 
the trial caused a sensation in brazil because it marked the 
first time native indians had been legally considered foreigners 
legally brazils 220000 indians are wards of the state and do not 
have the full rights of other citizens 
pereira ordered the trial suspended because kubei and paiakan 
were found to be native brazilians recognized by the federal 
constitution and because posey a brazil resident proved he had 
acted solely as a language interpreter when the remarks were made 
de oliveira said 
the courts action appeared to be an attempt by the government to 
back off the controversial case de oliveira would not comment on 
why the judge suspended the trial instead of simply throwing the 
charges out 
he said the proceedings could be renewed but the possibility of 
that was very very unlikely 
the trial began in august in belem capital of the northern 
amazon jungle state of para 
the brazilian government charged the kayapo chiefs and posey with 
illegal political activities after they spoke at miamis florida 
international university about forest conservation posey said he 
attended the forum as a friend and interpreter for the chiefs 
soon after the forum environmental groups invited paiakan and 
kubei to speak to the world bank in washington where they 
criticized deforestation in the amazon jungle erosion mercury 
pollution from gold mining and the construction of hydroelectric 
projects that caused flooding in lowlying jungle areas and 
displaced indian tribes 
later the world bank held back funds for the xingu hydroelectric 
project which would have inundated an estimated 188 million acres 
of mostly indian land 
many brazilian observers credited the kayapo chiefs with blocking 
the project 
but posey also a federal researcher in the brazilian national 
research council said funding had been suspended because of 
financing problems with the government power company eletronorte

rock hudson was guilty of outrageous 
conduct in concealing his aids diagnosis from his homosexual 
lover a jury ruled wednesday in awarding him 145 million from the 
late actors estate 
marc christian 35 won 35 million more than he had sought in 
the case regarded as a precedentsetting action and watched closely 
by lawyers no similar case has had a like result when the plaintiff 
has not developed aids 
hudson the handsome hollywood leading man who kept his 
homosexuality a closely guarded secret died oct 5 1985 at age 
58 a few months after his battle with aids became public knowledge 
christian who smiled when the verdict was read has consistently 
tested negative for the aids virus but claimed he was entitled to 
compensation for the emotional distress he suffered in fear that he 
would develop the disease 
christian declined to comment when he left the courtroom a gag 
order imposed by superior court judge bruce geernaert at the start 
of testimony last month remained in effect while the jury decides 
punitive damages 
geernaert ordered jurors to remain silent when they left the 
courtroom and told them they must return thursday morning to hear 
further evidence and deliberate on the question of punitive damages 
the damages awarded wednesday were compensatory meaning they are 
to compensate christian for actual losses punitive damages could be 
intended to punish the defendants for their actions 
with attorneys also prohibited from talking to reporters the 
size of hudsons estate also remained unknown the value of hudsons 
estate was not disclosed in his will when it was filed in november 
1985 
the will established a trust and contained no details about the 
trust except to say the value of the estate exceeded 10000 
the jury ruled that hudson conspired with secretary mark miller 
to keep secret the actors disease to induce christian to continue 
having highrisk sex with hudson 
miller who also was found liable didnt visibly react to the 
verdict but leaned over to talk with his attorney 
one of the 37 questions on a complicated verdict sheet filled out 
by the superior court jury was did rock hudson engage in 
outrageous conduct the jury answered yes 
the jurors also ruled that christian suffered emotional distress 
because he wasnt told about the actors condition 
the verdict was viewed as a landmark by margaret davis a los 
angeles attorney and author of lovers doctors and the law a 
book on the legal consequences of transmitting sexual diseases 
the jury is telling america that you have to make full and 
complete disclosure if you are aware that you have the disease 
ms davis said 
its absolutely a landmark case she said 
a spokesman for the san francisco aids foundation steven petrov 
said christian had a right to know that hudson had aids 
we find it a troubling case because it places the entire burden 
of safe sex on one individual and not the two petrov said it 
underscores for us again the need for everyone who engages in sexual 
activity to take responsibilityy for themselves as well as for their 
partners 
christian who lived with hudson during the last two years of the 
actors life testified the couple continued to have highrisk sex 
for eight months after hudson was told he had aids in june 1984 
christian and his attorney argued the actor had a duty to warn 
his lover he had the disease they accused miller one of the chief 
beneficiaries of hudsons will of conspiring to keep the actors 
disease secret from christian 
in a sevenweek trial punctuated by detailed testimony about the 
couples sex practices attorneys for miller and the hudson estate 
portrayed christian as a gigolo who took money for sex and had only 
a brief relationship with the actor 
christians attorney introduced as evidence sentimental love 
letters he received from hudson to buttress his claim the actor 
loved christian witnesses told of spying on hudson and christian 
while they engaged in homosexual sex

opposition leaders on wednesday said 
they will discuss this week whether to boycott the may 1 elections 
set by the new military regime 
the government of gen andres rodriguez reiterated on wednesday 
that it would not postpone the balloting despite opposition 
contentions that there is not enough time to mount an effective 
challenge to the ruling colorado party 
gen rodriguez expressed in a clear and final manner his vow to 
respect the constitution and its laws gen orlando machuca 
vargas the interior minister told reporters 
if we violate those articles of the constitution at the request 
of the opposition we would also be empowered to violate other 
articles 
the constitution states that in the event of the death 
disability or resignation of a president elections must be held 
within three months 
opposition leaders say rodriguez deposed president gen alfredo 
stroessner by coup on feb 3 so the constitutional clause does not 
apply 
this clearly shows the ill will of the provisional 
government said domingo laino president of the authentic liberal 
radical party theyve already violated the constitution with 
cannons 
laino said the national accord opposition coalition planned to 
consider thursday whether to participate in the elections under 
the existing conditions which we believe are not the most 
propitious for a clean election 
were not going to do what we refused to do during the 
stroessner years which is to participate in electoral farces 
laino said 
machuca vargas spoke with reporters following a meeting with 
rodriguez a 65yearold cavalry general and the presidential 
candidate of the ruling colorado party 
opposition parties filed a formal request for the postponement of 
elections with machuca vargas on monday saying they needed more 
time to organize if they were to have any chance of defeating 
colorado candidates the ministers official reply still was pending 
in past elections opposition parties called for the abstention 
or casting of blank votes and thus few of their leaders and members 
are included on voter registration lists

by 6 am 4 pm wednesday balloonist fumio niwa was 660 miles 
southeast of yokohama and flying at 35 mph at an altitude of 20000 
feet said his spokesman naoko higashi 
niwa set out before dawn wednesday from yokohama near tokyo in 
a mammoth blueandorange helium balloon depending solely on the 
power and direction of the wind he hoped to land in san diego 
yokohamas sister city 
during radio contact early thursday niwa described the 56foot 
helium balloon as slightly swollen and complained of rising 
temperatures in some of his instruments however neither problem 
was considered serious higashi said 
in radio contact made 2 hours later niwa reportedly said he was 
descending to 15000 feet because the balloon was swelling in higher 
outside temperatures 
otherwise there was nothing unusual niwa told higashi 
on wednesday niwa said the main compressor that maintains air 
pressure inside the tiny gondola broke down but that his backup 
compressor was working well 
niwa had planned to move directly into the jet stream at an 
altitude of 26000 feet to cover the 5000 miles to his target in 
four days 
but he changed his mind after discovering the jet stream was 
veering north rather than east as it normally does and could push 
him toward alaska 
his trip may now last six days and he has enough food to last 10 
higashi said 
he said hes going to hang under the jet stream as he 
approaches hawaii before moving up into the winds higashi said 
niwa said earlier he was staying low by holding on to his ballast 
so the balloon would drift farther south before entering the jet 
stream 
after his first half day of flight he commented all i see is 
clouds and the ocean i have nothing to take a picture of 
the temperature inside the unheated gondola an elongated capsule 
measuring 6 feet in diameter was 56 degrees wednesday evening and 
below freezing on the outside higashi said temperatures could 
plunge to minus 75 at such altitudes 
for heat niwa depends on his flying suit which has builtin 
electric coils powered by batteries charged by solar panels outside 
the gondola 
the gondola also is too small to stand up in and lacks 
navigational equipment niwa relies on amateur radio reports of his 
location drawn from radio beacon signals 
in 1981 four men traveled by balloon from japan to the united 
states but no one has crossed the pacific alone in a balloon 
niwa 38 has about 1000 hours of ballooning experience and he 
estimated the flight will cost about 540000 
he said money constraints kept him from installing alarms to warn 
him of a loss of gas in the balloon or a sudden change in altitude 
niwa quit his job at a computer company in november to prepare 
for the flight he hopes to recoup his investment from a book and 
public appearances

wildlife agents tried using a floating cage 
wednesday to capture and deport sea lions that have been devouring 
salmon trout and other migratory fish on puget sound 
so far the sea lions are winning 
fisheries experts over the last five years have tried everything 
from foultasting chemicals to taped sounds of predatory whales to 
stop the huge mammals from depleting the fish runs 
the latest and sixth plan of attack is a floating cage which was 
set just outside a ship canal to help wildlife agents remove the sea 
lions for tagging and then take them 250 miles to the pacific ocean 
off the southwest washington coast 
but the sea lions proved to be worthy opponents for the state and 
federal government 
on wednesday morning at least a dozen sea lions were crowded 
happily into the cage which was set out several weeks ago to allow 
them to become accustomed to it unsure if they could handle that 
many sea lions eight wildlife agents yelled and slapped the water 
with paddles to scare them away 
by wednesday afternoon two sea lions had been caught one of the 
sea lions nicknamed blue eye because of a cataract on his eye has 
been a problem for three years said bob delong marine mammal 
biologist with the national marine fisheries service 
were confident this plan is going to work said hal 
alabaster of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
but not too confident 
at the very least itll be a good test of how long it takes 
them to get back he said of the plan known officially at noaa as 
operation goodbye some are guessing theyll beat the trucks 
back 
in recent years nets and steel barriers at the ballard locks 
site of the fish ladder for fish returning to spawn have led to 
failure 
after sea lions simply swam under and over the net a lumber 
company put up a board that read sea lions 4 government 0 
alabaster said it was pretty embarrassing 
over the years the sea lions ignored tape recorded sounds of 
killer whales and fish injected with nauseating chemicals failed to 
slacken the sea lions voracious appetites 
the feasting sea lions have been the bane of fishermen and others 
concerned about the salmon run but they have delighted residents 
and tourists who flock to the ballard locks to watch the spectacle 
and applaud the frolicking animals 
this years run of steelhead was about 1650 at the fish ladder 
down from about 2600 last year officials said last month 
seven to nine california sea lions hanging around the locks 
are gulping an average of 14 fish a day each said bob byrne state 
wildlife department spokesman 
in operation goodbye the 300 to 800pound sea lions will be 
taken two at a time to a barge then to a hangar at the sand point 
naval base on lake washington where they will be tagged and 
equipped with radio collars so they can be tracked 
delong said moving a sea lion is like moving a leather bag 
filled with 600 pounds of rocks 
alabaster said if the sea lions return from long beach peninsula 
the next step might be to transport them all the way back to 
california

the cultural center in kwangju has been the target of frequent 
attacks by radical students demanding an end to us influnce in 
south korea 
several weeks ago the united states acknowledged that it was 
considering closing the kwangju cultural center because of repeated 
violent attacks and concern for the safety of its staff 
the center would be the first us facility shut down in the face 
of antiamerican protests 
the government apologized publicly after two attacks in january 
and appealed to radical students not to damage ties with the united 
states

three senior parliamentarians urged japan to develop 
its own plane after us congressmen criticized an agreement for 
joint usjapanese development of japans next jet fighter a 
newspaper said wednesday 
the englishlanguage japan times said the three told reporters 
this week that japan should consider abandoning an agreement to 
develop its future mainstay fighter using technology from the us 
f16 
it said former transport minister shintaro ishihara and two other 
legislators suggested japan should go ahead with development of its 
own jet fighter called the fsx 
since there clearly are disagreements over the accord they 
suggested that the agreement be reviewed and possibly abandoned 
an aide to one of the legislators said on condition of anonymity 
japan orginally intended to build the jet on its own but us 
government officials and aircraft makers urged tokyo to buy 
usmade f16 jets to help cut japans 476 billion trade surplus 
with the united states 
after years of talks the two sides signed a memorandum of 
understanding last november under which mitsubishi heavy industries 
japans leading defense contractor would head development of the 
fsx using technology from japan and from general dynamics which 
produces the f16 
congress will have 30 days to vote against the project after it 
is formally approved by the bush administration 
the fsx issue surfaced on feb 3 during prime minister noboru 
takeshitas visit to washington where he urged bush to line up 
congressional support for the agreement 
last week 21 senators introduced a resolution declaring strong 
reservations about the deal and urging a 60day delay to allow 
time for a review 
in japan the criticism of an agreement seen as a concession to 
the united states led to renewed calls to develop the plane alone 
supporters say its the best compromise possible given japans 
refusal to buy f16s from the united states they say the 
arrangement involves beneficial technology exchanges and will 
generate employment in both countries 
american critics say the agreement virtually gives away 7 
billion in advanced aircraft technology that eventually could help 
japan compete effectively against the united states in the global 
aviation market a field in which japan lags 
japanese officials said that despite the uproar they hope to go 
ahead with the plan japan has appropriated 842 million in its 
preliminary budget for the fiscal year beginning april 1 for fsx 
development 
initially 130 of the jets are to be built with a possible 
followup order of about 100 more at a cost of 405 million each 
japan reportedly will maintain control over the fsx design and over 
any new technology developed 
general dynamics would act as a subcontractor to mitsubishi and 
receive about 35 to 45 percent of the work funded entirely by the 
japanese government 
japans aviation industry has remained small it relies mainly on 
defense contracts including development of japans current jet 
fighter the f1 and production of f15 fighters under license from 
mcdonnell douglas of the united states

army chief humberto regalado 
hernandez on wednesday criticized remarks attributed to cia director 
william webster about alleged military conspiracies to topple latin 
american governments 
the armed forces were not created to govern the country but to 
work within the constitution the military chief said for this 
reason we are bothered by a foreigner questioning what we have 
denied and repeated 
on feb 10 webster was quoted by the los angeles times as saying 
democrats and republicans in the united states should agree on 
undercover work in latin america because of growing restlessness and 
coup conspiracies in the region 
in the interview the cia chief said some fragile latin american 
democracies depend on the military to maintain law and order 
the times quoted webster as saying us secretary of state james 
baker must confront difficult situations in other parts of latin 
america and mentioned nicaragua honduras panama and haiti as 
possible trouble spots he said military conspiracies exist to 
overthrow various governments 
regalado said he wants webster to present his proof of who is 
conspiring because if there is someone under my command then i 
would have to take decisions that the situation merited 
honduras congress appointed a special commission tuesday night 
of six deputies belonging to the nations four active political 
parties to investigate the matter and issue a report in 30 days 
the group plans to interview us ambassador everett e briggs 
and then key military leaders 
the congress mandated the group try to discover the truth about 
the alleged conspiracy that exists in the country that intends to 
change the government 
charles barclay spokesman at the us embassy said the 
united states will continue its constant support to democratic 
institutions in latin america 
what webster said is that the administration of president 
george bush will have as its principal policy the strengthening of 
democratic latin america and he warned that the future of the 
region is highly unpredictable because the hemisphere is confronting 
serious threats to democracy

ethics already is required study for harvard 
university business students but campus activists said wednesday 
they want an honor code to prevent even the rumor of a breach in 
their computerized classrooms 
were not terrible amoral people here said anthony 
antonick if we can come up with some sort of list to go by i 
think people would conform to the rules 
antonick is one of a group of business students that organized in 
reaction to recent rumors of borderline behavior during classroom 
testing the students are hoping in the coming months to pool their 
opinions and come up with a formal code that the school might 
eventually adopt 
there are clearly things that are right and clearly things that 
are wrong said earl sasser chairman of the masters degree 
program in business administration but where things are less 
clear there is for me the need for some kind of honor code 
the 80yearold business school has left students on their honor 
free to take breaks during exams and remain after the testing period 
was up to print out their answers 
since the school began requiring students to use personal 
computers in the classrooms questions of impropriety have cropped 
up is it acceptable for people to exchange diskettes during exams 
should students be allowed to print out their answers after the 
allotted test time is up if so would it be cheating to correct a 
typographical error 
when rumors began circulating on campus that there had been some 
cheating during final exams concerned firstyear students began 
discussions on ethics 
antonick said he and others who organized an informal survey 
recently were surprised at the disparity among students opinions of 
what might constitute an ethical compromise 
were looking at not only dos and donts of testtaking but 
also at issues of whats acceptable in terms of classroom 
preparation and participation said jennifer raiser a survey 
organizer 
last fall the schools 800 firstyear students were required for 
the first time to take a threeweek course in ethics spurred in 
large part by a 20 million gift from former securities and exchange 
commission chairman john shad 
but the schools own policy toward cheating and other ethical 
questions was not sufficiently clear raiser said 
were trying to draw the line between competitiveness and 
fairness raiser said you can be competitive but there are 
still some guidelines of decency that people can and should abide 
by

the vatican on wednesday took to task 
theologians who question the church ban on contraception and accused 
them of sowing confusion among the faithful 
a frontpage editorial in the daily newspaper losservatore 
romano repeated a statement by pope john paul ii that the ban is not 
open to discussion 
it did not cite anyone by name but mentioned recent remarks by 
one noted moral theologian and challenges to the church teaching 
by other theologians 
last month a group of 170 germanspeaking theologians released a 
statement called the cologne declaration that strongly criticized 
the pope and the ban on artificial birth control 
the italian press earlier quoted another german theologian 
bernard haring as attacking one of the popes advisers on family 
issues 
the editorial responding to criticism carried three asterisks at 
the end the newspapers way of showing it was authoritative 
the editorial said married couples having difficulties living up 
to the churchs teaching for personal economic or social reasons 
deserve great respect and love 
but it said there was also need to affirm that the moral norms in 
pope paul vis 1968 encyclical humane vitae which barred 
aritificial birth control do not allow exceptions 
it said this was no rigid and intransigent interpretation but 
has been the clear and explicit teaching of both paul vi and 
john paul ii 
losservatore romano said doubts raised over the roman catholic 
churchs teaching on the family amounted to a concerted and 
systematic attack by some theologians and lamented what it called 
the serious confusion and misunderstandings caused among the 
faithful 
it repeated remarks by john paul in june 1987 that what is 
taught by the church on contraception is not a matter that can be 
discussed freely by theologians to teach otherwise is tantamount to 
inducing into error the moral conscience of the married

the house minority leader rep robert h 
michel rill said wednesday he would try to block floor action on 
legislation requiring disclosure of foreign owners of us property 
it has very serious implications for the faltering financial 
industry and the potential international repercussions are 
considerable michel said in a letter to the house rules committee 
chairman rep claude pepper dfla 
the bill scheduled for floor action thursday would require 
foreign owners to report sizable holdings in this country to the 
federal government 
sponsored by rep john bryant dtexas the plan started life as 
part of the 1000page trade bill that was signed into law last year 
but was dropped long before the trade measure reached the 
presidents desk 
the administration said it would stifle vitally needed foreign 
investment and hurt business in a variety of other ways bryant said 
americans deserve to know who owns property in this country 
michel said the bill heavily debated last year should have been 
sent to committee again for a fresh hearing before being brought to 
the floor 
having just read the preliminary floor schedule for next week 
i find myself imploring you to tell me it aint so said 
michels letter to pepper who as rules committee chairman cleared 
the way for the vote 
this is a new congress a new century of government with a new 
president new direction and constantly changing public opinions and 
circumstances michel said 
wright was en route to texas and thus had not seen michels 
letter according to an aide mark johnson 
the letter was distributed to reporters by the republican 
leaders office 
an increase in foreign investment in us property in recent 
years has prompted concern on capitol hill although a twoyearold 
study by the general accounting office an investigative arm of 
congress found that overseas owners still held only a tiny

opposition leaders said wednesday they 
are pleased president daniel ortega has promised electoral reform 
but added that the sandinistas must be watched carefully or theyll 
try to cheat 
president ortega only talked with the central american 
presidents but he still needs to talk with the nicaraguan people 
said gilberto cuadra president of the opposition superior council 
of private enterprise 
ortega announced tuesday at the end of a twoday regional summit 
in el salvador that nicaragua will hold early elections permit the 
opposition freedom to campaign and allow united nations observers 
into the country 
ortega and the presidents of honduras el salvador guatemala and 
costa rica also announced they will devise a plan within 90 days to 
dismantle the usbacked nicaraguan rebel force known as the 
contras 
in a nationally televised speech wednesday night ortega went 
over the summit points and said his governments willingness to 
institute election reform shows our political strength which is 
rooted in the nicaraguan people 
miriam arguello secretary general of the nicaraguan conservative 
party said in an interview in el salvador that the opposition will 
play watchdog 
we can be sure that the sandinistas in spite of their 
signature will do whatever they can get away with to win 
arguello said but we will fight to make them comply with their 
agreements 
nevertheless arguello said the four democratic presidents of 
central america have given the nicaraguan opposition a weapon that 
we can use to say for ourselves who will govern us 
also on wednesday the government announced the cordobas fourth 
devaluation this year fuel prices automatically increased and a 
rise in the price of basic foods was expected shortly as a result of 
the 185 percent devaluation of the nicaraguan currency 
the leftist sandinistas have been hurt by the crash of the 
nicaraguan economy which has resulted in 20000 percent annual 
inflation they blame most of their problems on a us economic 
boycott and the war against the contras 
they face an opposition split into at least 14 parties and 
arguello and others said that advancing the elections by 10 months 
to february 1990 would actually give the sandinistas an advantage 
we see advancing the elections as a typical sandinista game 
they look like they are willing to sacrifice time in office but 
they also leave less time for the organization and mobilization of 
the parties she said 
she said the period for organization of parties was short 
given that the opposition has been repressed restricted and 
terrorized 
there remains much to discuss in this country cuadra whose 
council is nicaraguas largest grouping of businessmen said in an 
interview broadcast by radio noticias an independent private radio 
station 
jose antonio bonilla of a faction of the socialchristian party 
told the associated press that advancing the elections left too 
little time for the development and adequate organization of the 
political bodies 
luis vega miranda an official of another faction of the 
socialchristian party called ortegas promises superficial 
upon his return to nicaragua on tuesday night ortega called the 
presidential agreement to dismantle the contras the final blow to 
the war 
an estimated 11000 rebels and about 10000 family members are 
living in camps on honduran territory along the nicaraguan border 
it remained unclear how the agreement at the summit would directly 
affect the contras 
wednesdays devaluation announced by the central bank raised 
the cordobas official rate of exchange to 3200 cordobas to the 
us dollar up from 2700 cordobas to the dollar fuel prices also 
rose as of wednesday the price of a gallon of gasoline went from 
5600 cordobas to 6700 cordobas 
in january the cordoba was devalued three times 
ortega announced on jan 30 an austerity plan for 1989 to combat 
inflation he has said at least 30000 public employees will be laid 
off and many government subsidies will be eliminated

rushdie and others led us to conclude that the current climate is 
not appropriate for a promotional tour in the us as previously 
planned 
the statement said no offense was intended in writing or 
publishing the book and ended it is also our unalterable position 
that freedom of speech freedom to publish and freedom to read must 
be guaranteed internationally 
the satanic verses has sold more than 100000 copies since it 
was published in britain in september to critical acclaim 
at least five countries have formally banned the novel india 
pakistan bangladesh egypt and south africa 
christian bourgois a french publishing house that bought the 
rights to the novel said wednesday it was delaying publication 
britain recently reopend its embassy in tehran and the foreign 
office said browne was seeking a meeting with iranian authorities to 
clarify the situation 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati told diplomats in tehran the 
government would order the closure of cultural centers of nations 
that permit publication of the book tehran radio reported 
there has been no direct impact on ties so far irna said 
wednesday but by being the first to allow the book to be 
published on its soil britain could pay a heavy price for ignoring 
the strong sentiments of over 1 billion moslems worldwide 
mostafa barzegar spokesman for irans culture and islamic 
guidance ministry announced a ban on books published by viking and 
other imprints of the penguin group and said penguins invitation 
to the second tehran international book fair in may has been 
canceled irna said

in the netherlands opposition lawmakers appealed to foreign 
minister hans van den broek to cancel a planned trip to tehran 
police were posted outside rushdies home and the office of his 
publisher viking and kureishi said rushdie had gone into hiding 
he is obviously very frightened said kureishi these people 
are completely nutters said kureishi who wrote the script for 
the film my beautiful laundrette 
a major character in rushdies book is named mahound a medieval 
corruption of the name of the prophet mohammed moslems have 
complained the book represents the prophets wives as prostitutes 
and suggests that he wrote the koran rather than receiving it from 
god 
the title refers to verses which mohammed removed from the koran 
islams holy book believing they had been inspired by the devil 
before he went into hiding rushdie expressed no apologies for 
his book 
frankly i wish i had written a more critical book he said 
in an interview with bbctv on tuesday 
a religion that claims it is able to behave like this 
religious leaders who are able to behave like this and then say 
this is a religion which must be above any kind of whisper of 
criticism that doesnt add up rushdie said

the 81yearold woman sat quietly in a waiting 
room her priestly robes gathered about her as she remembered the 
perilous journey across wartorn china that culminated with her 
ordination in 1944 as the first female priest in the anglican 
communion 
the issue was one of pastoral necessity no male priest dare 
run the risk of being stationed in macao a tiny portuguese 
territory on the southern chinese coast 
but the break with 2000 years of christian tradition 
reverberated thousands of miles away in england and in 1946 the 
rev florence timoi li was given an ultimatum she must resign or 
the bishop who ordained her would be forced to resign 
theres no problem the chinese woman recently recalled 
thinking then i would give up my title i dont only want the 
title 
last week more than four decades after she acceded to church 
pressure to preseve an allmale priesthood li helped elevate the 
rev barbara c harris into the highest echelons of the anglican 
hierarchy 
in my life i can see the first woman bishop li said it 
made me hopeful things are realized now 
harris triumph refocused attention on the historical role of li 
who quietly continued her religious work in china after world war ii 
and through the cultural revolution while the battle for female 
anglican priests raged in the united states and elsewhere 
the episcopal church approved female priests in 1976 two years 
after 11 women were illegally ordained in a service in 
philadelphia 
one of the 11 the rev i carter heyward said it was an 
extraordinarily profound and moving experience to be a 
concelebrant with li at the consecration service 
i feel part of a great chain said the rev suzanne r hiatt 
another member of the philadelphia 11 
while advocates for the ordination of women have often taken 
matters into their own hands with lobbying and illegal 
ordinations lis path to the priesthood was different 
in much beloved daughter his book about li ted harrison 
said she had been working as a priest in all but name in macao 
during world war ii when bishop ro hall made his decision to 
ordain her nearby hong kong had fallen to the japanese and travel 
to macao had become dangerous as people sought to flee there 
with male priests denied permission to go to macao li was 
authorized to baptize marry bury and eventually even distribute 
holy communion 
in a letter to the archbishop of canterbury explaining his 
decision to ordain li bishop hall said please be sure that my 
reason was not theoretical views of the equality of men and women 
but the needs of my people for the sacraments and the manifest gift 
of the pastoral charisma 
as news of her ordination spread to england protests mounted 
against halls unilateral decision to break with church tradition 
in an interview at harris consecration li recalled her reaction 
when she realized the uproar threatened hall who had refused even 
before the archbishop of canterbury to back down 
i pray quietly she said 
she said it took her a brief time to decide to stop functioning 
as a priest because she knew the act of ordination placed a calling 
upon her that could not be revoked even if she no longer held the 
title publicly 
this holy order i never put it off i work for the church 
quietly calmly for the rest of my life she said 
the ordination of li who works as a priest now in toronto was 
eventually recognized she celebrated holy communion according to 
the chinese anglican rite as early as christmas eve 1957 but there 
are still reminders that women clergy are not universally accepted 
in the anglican communion 
thus archbishop of canterbury robert runcie warmly welcomed li 
to westminster abbey in 1984 for a service marking the 40th 
anniversary of her ordination but li and the other women clergy 
could not officiate at communion because the church of england still 
does not accept women clergy the church of england and the 
episcopal church are among 27 selfgoverning churches in the 70 
millionmember anglican communion 
reflecting on her own experience li said she has no doubt god 
called harris to be the female bishop in the anglican communion 
he opens a proper way for women to help their church to move 
on to give more help to people especially the female good news 
to the female li said god uses all of his creatures he would 
like every one of us to create a beautiful world

when the federal government decided to 
put the superconducting super collider here bands played and folks 
celebrated youd have thought the 1901 spindletop gusher was 
pumping oil again 
gov bill clements declared a great day for texas newspapers ran 
huge headlines politicians predicted new jobs and a building boom 
and the chamber of commerce toasted waxahachies good fortune 
when you talk about what it means to us and the state of texas 
275 million to 300 million is not anything to sneeze at 
chamber director nb buck jordan said when waxahachie was 
chosen nov 10 over six other states as the site for the 
53milelong underground particle accelerator 
waxahachie a town of 18000 people about 25 miles south of 
dallas is the seat of primarily agricultural ellis county the 
county blossomed in the early 1980s but not as much as its northern 
neighbors dallas and tarrant counties two years ago the largely 
rural area felt the blow of the texas recession 
faced with the prospect of 4000 construction jobs and 3500 
permanent jobs connected with the proposed ronald reagan center for 
highenergy physics jordan said its fantastic whats 
happening 
arizona illinois colorado michigan north carolina and 
tennessee lost out to texas in the competition and losers 
complaints of influencepeddling in the site selection havent 
subsided construction money also hasnt arrived and ellis county 
has yet to see benefits from the 59 billionproject 
energy secretary john herrington stamped the final seal of 
approval on the texas site jan 18 president bush who calls 
himself a texan has agreed with reagans recommendation to spend 
250 million in fiscal 1990 160 million on initial construction 
and 90 million on research and development 
but area residents didnt seem to notice 
take city manager bob sokoll for instance he said he had heard 
the site might have been finalized but didnt know for sure and he 
wasnt going to get worked up about it anyhow he smiles an uneasy 
smile when talking about getting the money out of a congress that is 
looking for ways to cut the federal budget 
congress agreed last year to spend 100 million on the project 
but none of it for construction 
put it to you this way and im not trying to be negative 
about this but i wouldnt go out and buy a lot of land yet unless 
i was a pretty good gambler sokoll said 
in fact about the only thing that has changed around ellis 
county since nov 10 he said is a surge in real estate activity 
and even that is hard to measure realtors say there has been a lot 
of looking but little buying 
i think we could be close to making some big deals said 
realtor tom crabb 
linda sukla an agent with coldwell banker in waxahachie said 
she saw an increase in people looking at land after the selection 
but after the first month it slowed down a little there are 
no done deals 
over in maypearl population 462 some people hope there never 
are any done deals if the super collider is built its campus would 
be nearby 
maypearl hasnt changed a lick as they say thereabouts its 
still a twocafe onebarbershop town folks who drive through still 
wave at cars going the other way on a monday afternoon there are 
two little boys riding bicycles on the sidewalks through the middle 
of the onestreet downtown in front of boarded storefronts 
inside rubys main street kitchen at the west end of town grady 
moore 81 is waiting for a hamburger to go and kindly criticizing 
the older folks who dont want anything to change 
moore said many older residents of maypearl and western ellis 
county dont want anything to do with the super collider they like 
things the way they are slow and peaceful they want their children 
and dogs to be able to wander through town at a leisurely 
unmolested pace 
a lot of them are worried about drugs and alcohol but im for 
anything thats good for jobs even if it does shake up some things 
little 
moore a retired steelworker talks of missed opportunity and 
wasted worry 
i can understand why they feel that way worried and all but 
they have to allow change for the young people 
these young people need jobs thats whats important that 
they have something to look forward to when they get out of school

at the white house its one man one voice 
from a political pulpit that cannot be matched that has been a 
dilemma for democrats through most of the past two decades but they 
thought it would ease when ronald reagan retired 
theyre learning otherwise president bush may not be the great 
communicator but hes isnt bad and the democrats have no solo 
spokesman to send up against him 
that is an inevitable problem for the opposition party even one 
as powerful as the 1989 democrats who control the senate and house 
and hold a majority of governorships and state legislatures 
in the age of the sound bite the president commands audiences 
and attention they cannot match for all their clout 
bush took his message to congress and the nation in a nationally 
televised address last thursday with a catalogue of proposals that 
redeemed campaign promises and emphasized what he wants government 
to do he offered a defense spending curb to offset part of the 
cost but left the details of paying for deficit reduction for later 
hes taken the same themes on the road with three speeches this 
week calling his a sensible budget that can meet needs without new 
taxes and promising to cooperate with the democratic congress to 
get it all done 
nothing dramatic there its essentially a rerun but it shows 
the power of the president any president to dominate the dialogue 
ronald h brown the new democratic chairman says hell work to 
make the party more competitive in communications by stressing the 
democrats message and providing the technology to deliver it to 
voters 
brown the first black man to head a major party said he will 
deliver part of that message personally as a national democratic 
spokesman i dont believe our chairman should try to set the 
party line on policy and i wont try he said as he took office 
but i do want to help define our party because if we dont define 
ourselves our opponents surely will 
speaker of the house jim wright of texas and senate majority 
leader george mitchell of maine are the partys chief spokesmen at 
the capitol where that line is set issue by issue rarely with 
unanimity 
wright brings some political scars to the task an ethics 
investigation and his unpopular role as legislative strategist for a 
51 percent pay raise rejected after he had to reverse himself and 
submit it to a house vote 
mitchell is a new leader a new face and a persuasive speaker 
that makes him an effective spokesman but he has 54 colleagues 
most of whom want a piece of the action too 
none of that adds up to a jim and george show to rival the 
performances of ev and charlie then ev and jerry those were the 
weekly appearances of senate republican leader everett dirksen of 
illinois and his house counterparts first charles halleck of 
indiana then gerald r ford of michigan back in the 1960s when 
republicans seemed an endangered species 
dirksen was a political showman the house leader got to play his 
straight man 
republicans regularly sought to devise new ways to deliver their 
message and get somebody to listen their plight was worse for the 
fact that they were out of power in congress as well as the white 
house even with congressional majorities democrats have had 
trouble competing for political attention with the republican 
presidents who have held office 16 of the past 20 years 
back when democrats had the presidency too the gop set up 
something forbiddingly named the republican coordinating committee 
including the partys congressional leaders representatives of its 
governors and former presidential nominees it met issued policy 
statements and vanished ineffective and unmourned when richard 
nixon became president 
when ford lost the white house to democrat jimmy carter he said 
the republicans should set up a shadow cabinet on the british model 
that didnt work out either presidents are always seen and heard 
but for the opposition its a struggle to find a stage

cheryl ladds new tv movie might have a rather 
scandalous plot but the story was recommended to her by her mother 
airing sunday on cbs the fulfillment of mary gray is based 
on the romantic novel the fulfillment by laveryle spencer 
about a turnofthecentury farm couple who consider an unusual way 
of overcoming their lack of children 
the husband decides that his younger brother can father their 
child miss ladd said 
the author based the book on stories she had heard from her 
grandmother the book was recommended to miss ladd by her mother 
my mothers an avid reader miss ladd said she not only 
recommended that i read it but said it would make a fabulous film i 
read it and agreed with her it has great characters and a rich and 
powerful story good stories are tough to find i worked on the 
script six to eight months with laird koenig 
miss ladds husband brian russell was supervising producer on 
the film miss ladd said she liked the story because of the way the 
characters relationships changed 
the wife and the brother had been friendly up to that time but 
there was nothing more said miss ladd but when the husband 
makes the announcement at the dinner table it changes all 
relationships they had been married for seven years and had no 
children he comes to the conclusion it was because he had mumps as 
a boy hes a very religious man and he prays and prays and comes to 
this decision 
shes very hurt by the suggestion that he would give her to 
another man he thinks hes giving her a gift children are very 
important on farms and its important that the land be passed on 
generation to generation when the husband goes out of town for a 
few days they make a baby and fall in love now it really gets 
sticky because she loves both of them 
the movie also stars ted levine as her husband and lewis smith as 
the younger brother piers haggard directed the movie was filmed in 
brenham texas which stood in for minnesota 
we got the weather we needed in fact all four seasons she 
said we found a farm house from the early 1900s and a grange hall 
for a dance 
miss ladd said she was attracted to the book because its a 
strong story that presents a moral issue that we can all relate 
to 
these are all imperfect people she said you can feel the 
pain theyre going through theyre good people trying to do the 
right thing the husband is solid quiet and introspective the 
brother is more open and more fun put them together and they make a 
complete man 
miss ladds last television appearance was the cbs miniseries 
bluegrass but she is best known for the popular series of the 
1970s charlies angels 
her latest feature film millenium which also stars daniel 
j travanti and kris kristofferson will be out in april

the world premiere of the barber of seville 
was such a fiasco that the humiliated composer young gioacchino 
rossini fled the theater in fear of assassination 
luckily the piece survived that first rome performance in 1816 
and has gone on to become the most popular comic opera of all time 
television viewers can sample its melodious delights tonight when 
it is shown on the public broadcasting service as part of the series 
the metropolitan opera presents 
rossini always a fast worker claimed he spent all of 13 days 
setting to music his adaptation of the famous play of the same name 
by the french dramatist beaumarchais the straightforward plot tells 
how two young lovers heroine rosina and her suitor count almaviva 
triumph over old fogies her guardian dr bartolo and the music 
teacher don basilio with the help of some inventive duplicity 
provided by the resourceful barber figaro 
tonights performance taped last fall is well worth watching 
both for diehard opera fans and for those to whom the words largo 
al factotum are more suggestive of a prescription for cough 
medicine than the title of figaros big patter song english 
subtitles are provided for viewers who dont know italian 
chief among its virtues are the performances of kathleen battle 
as the spunky rosina and enzo dara as bartolo the elderly 
gentleman who is not only her guardian but who wants to become her 
husband 
miss battles soprano is as ravishing as ever and her voice 
sounds fuller and more powerful than it often does in the opera 
house 
rossini wrote the part of rosina for a mezzo but it is often 
appropriated by sopranos few listeners will regret a casting 
decision that allows miss battle to toss off scads of highflying 
coloratura the way she does here 
the only blemish on her performance is a lack of spontaneity in 
her acting and a tendency to rely too heavily on stock gestures and 
facial expressions 
dara is a joy to watch a great comic actor having a field day 
and he can sing too he brings the house down in his act 1 aria 
feigning heart failure one moment dancing a jig the next in act 2 
he steals the music lesson scene right out from under miss battle 
without opening his mouth nodding off in his easy chair a glass 
full of wine in his hand gradually tipping over further and further 
until it spills 
unfortunately the figaro of leo nucci and the almaviva of 
rockwell blake dont measure up to their costars both are 
efficient but charmless and blake while undeniably an expert vocal 
acrobat often looks and sounds illatease 
too bad the telecast couldnt have borrowed the superior figaro 
and almaviva who took over the roles later at the met americans 
thomas hampson and frank lopardo 
the production by john cox boasts a spectacular turntable set by 
robin wagner that allows a speedy changeofscene in act 1 and some 
welcome visual distraction during the storm scene in act 2 
conductor ralf weikert takes a brisk nononsense approach to the 
proceedings but thats a shame because the barber is nonsense 
inspired nonsense and the music doesnt sparkle and bubble as it 
can under lighter batons 
il barbiere di siviglia has long been rossinis most popular 
work aside from the overture to william tell but its start 
in life was shaky another italian composer giovanni paisiello had 
set the same beaumarchais play to music 35 years earlier and his 
followers disrupted the premiere of rossinis work with whistles and 
catcalls 
the second night went much better and by the third night the 
new piece was being hailed as a triumph one that swept across 
europe and quickly put paisiellos work into the shade 
its the second of three operas televised this season in the met 
series this spring viewers can see a twin bill of bartoks 
bluebeards castle and schoenbergs erwartung 
host for the series is actor f murray abraham

but financial observers say it is important to separate mere 
gimmicks from good deals and to concentrate on the total cost of a 
given loan 
fortyyear and interest only mortgages have recently made 
their appearance at a few large bigcity lending institutions the 
prime target for both is firsttime homebuyers who have to stretch 
especially hard to meet monthly payments 
with the interest only mortgage advertised recently by one 
bank the borrower does not begin repaying the principal on the loan 
until the sixth year 
conceivably these propositions could provide access to the 
housing market for some people who couldnt otherwise qualify 
but analysts point out that the potential benefits of either seem 
small on a conventional mortgage very little principal is paid 
back in the first five years anyway 
and stretching out a loan from the customary 30 years to 40 
yields a surprisingly small difference in the monthly payment 
on a fixed 30year 100000 mortgage at 10 percent interest the 
monthly payment would be 87757 calculates william brennan editor 
of the financial planning reporter newsletter published by the 
accounting firm of ernst amp whinney 
extend the term of the loan to 40 years and the monthly payment 
is reduced only to 84915 the 2842 difference is really 
meaningless brennan observes 
one cost of this modest benefit is much slower reduction in the 
unpaid loan balance leaving the borrower with less equity in the 
property 
after 15 years of payments the 30year borrower would have 
worked the balance down to 8164456 while the 40year borrower 
would still owe 9344616 
with the adjustablerate mortgages that are common these days 
the same dubious tradeoffs apply 
in fact notes robert heady publisher of several banking 
newsletters in north palm beach fla the extra interest a 40year 
borrower pays will increase should rates go up 
on a 100000 loan at 109 percent he reckons the 40year 
borrower will wind up paying about 101600 more in interest than 
the 30year borrower 
should the rate increase to 129 percent the difference expands 
to about 123600 
the stretchout to 40 years means inviting a lot of pain down 
the road heady says 
at the other end of the time scale the 15minute mortgage is the 
latest brainchild of citicorp one of the nations biggest 
originators of home loans 
fifteenminute of course refers not to the duration of the 
loan but to the time citicorp says it will take to process a 
mortgage application rather than the usual three weeks to a month 
according to the company the 15minute service will be done with 
a computer to approve or reject applications transmitted over 
telephone lines from the offices of real estate brokers and lawyers 
there may be something to be said for such rapid service 
replacing the agonizing wait that aspiring homeowners often endure 
while lending institutions decide their fate 
but financial experts say the speed of processing is a separate 
question from matters that remain important for many years in 
particular which lenders mortgage will cost you the least over the 
period in which you expect to own the home

the national academy of recording arts amp 
sciences which annually bestows the industrys highest honor has 
been reshaped over the past year to pay more attention to artists 
needs and to educate the public about the music industry 
but while this years grammy awards show is a far cry from the 
days of andy williams as it recognizes new formats of music 
including rap and heavy metal academy president michael greene 
still wants to retain the integrity of contemporary american music 
our challenge has always been to remain true to why we are an 
academy and what the entire scope of music is all about and not 
worry about the rest of it he said 
the threehour presentation of the 31st annual grammy awards is 
scheduled for broadcast on wednesday feb 22 from 8 to 11 pm est 
on cbstv from the stage of the shrine auditorium in los angeles 
the show was telecast from radio city music hall in new york last 
year it will alternate between the two cities 
for the first time in grammy history a heavy metal group will 
perform metallica whose sound is slightly more melodic than other 
hardcore metal groups has antiwar themes running through its 
music the groups popularity has soared without major radio airplay 
and few videos metallica has been nominated in the hard rockmetal 
vocal or instrumental for and justice for all 
another first on the telecast is a latin music performance 
however the academy isnt presenting a mainstream latin group or 
artist such as tito puente but pop artist linda ronstandt she will 
sing la charreada from her album canciones de mi padre 
which has been nominated in the best mexicanamerican performance 
category 
meanwhile some rap artists feel snubbed because the rap music 
award isnt set for the televised portion of the show and greene 
said the network is uneasy because hes delivering a short 
stateoftheprofession speech a move destined to send home 
audiences running to the refrigerator for refills 
cbs hates it they truly hate it when we get out and spend 
even two minutes talking about issues greene said but it 
would be a real failing on the part of the academy not to what we 
are really about is the representation of the creative and technical 
community all the other 364 days of the year 
greene the first fulltime president of naras has been busy 
restructuring the 6000member organization since he arrived here 
last march included in his plans are a museum an archive and 
research center and a permanent office building for the academy 
but the primary product of the organization is the annual grammy 
ceremony which includes 76 categories this year 17 of which will 
be presented during the broadcast produced by pierre cossette with 
billy crystal as host the rest of the awards are handed out during 
a fastpaced nontelevised ceremony before the show 
top nominees for the best music of 1988 include singersongwriter 
tracy chapman with six nominations for her surprise debut album and 
jazz stylist bobby mcferrin with five nominations most of them for 
his dont worry be happy single and the simple pleasures lp 
from which it came 
unlike the american music awards show which was designed for 
television consumption and based on consumer popularity the grammys 
is an awards presentation that wound up being televised it also 
carries prestige and guarantees to any artist or group chosen to 
perform exposure to millions of potential record buyers 
so rarely is everyone happy with how the show turns out one 
year jazz artists said they were snubbed and threatened to form 
their own academy classical and gospel artists also have complained 
of being shortchanged 
this year with their foot just in the door rap artists are 
already dissing the gramdogs speaking badly about the academy 
and threatening a major chillout boycott 
don rush of rush artist management said two clients nominees 
ll cool j and dj jazzy jeff and the fresh prince will not be 
attending the awards show jeff and the prince also were scheduled 
as presenters 
rush said rappers were ambivalent about the creation of the award 
category in the first place because it could isolate the 
multiinfluenced genre from rhythm and blues and rock slots 
and now to find out were being treated like a stepchild our 
guys just arent interested rush told the entertainment trade 
paper daily variety 
there is no tail that wags this dog greene said in an 
interview the academy and the grammy show is not going to respond 
to boycotts because if we did that we would have to do it every 
year 
last year rundmc also clients of rush management performed 
on the show in anticipation of the rap category being added 
i love whats going on in that music category and i fought 
very hard to get it added greene said it just wasnt possible 
to fit it into three hours if we turn it into a miniseries maybe 
we can do it 
what the show will feature is the theme and essence of 
contemporary music to showcase musical diversity from hiphop to 
heavy metal to country to jazz to rock said greene 
among those scheduled to perform are melissa etheridge sinead o 
connor and toni childs representing three female rockers who are 
really the new kids on the block greene said 
other performers include itzhak perlman anita baker whitney 
houston lyle lovett bobby mcferrin kt oslin buck owens dan 
seals take 6 joe williams the winans and dwight yoakum 
lifetime achievement award winners dizzy gillespie lena horne 
leontyne price and sarah vaughan will participate in a special jazz 
segment

on the eve of the grammy awards ceremony a black 
singersongwriter is the record industrys uncrowned queen tracy 
chapman swept most major categories for her groundbreaking debut 
album receiving six nominations 
michael jackson is looking to add to his trophy collection with 
the gospeltinged man in the mirror while bobby mcferrin with 
five nominations anita baker and whitney houston are also 
contending for big awards all are black and all have been nominated 
for the national academy of recording arts amp sciences most 
prestigious award record of the year 
it would appear that the music industry is free from racial 
strife a look beneath the surface however says otherwise 
according to minorities and others in the business and the 
nations oldest civil rights group not only do blacks have 
difficulty getting their music heard except for the superstars 
they also are kept from the corporate jobs that drive the industry 
music history has its share of bigotry white artists remaking 
black hits for white audiences and reaping the financial rewards 
pioneer rockers such as bo diddley who were underpaid or not paid 
and had to fight for every dime motown artists who kept their black 
faces off album covers and few can ever forget that rhythm and 
blues was once referred to as race music and its artists were 
treated like thirdclass citizens 
but its more than history a scathing report by the national 
association for the advancement of colored people in 1987 concluded 
the record industry is overwhelmingly segregated and 
discrimination is rampant blacks are blocked from advancing at 
every level said the naacp 
two years later little has changed said fred rasheed author of 
the report 
we have to constantly remind ourselves that this is just music 
that we have to break down these barriers said ramon hervey a 
manager whos steered the careers of such artists as luther vandross 
and andrae crouch its just ingrained into the record companies 
the music business is like sports where there are plenty of 
blacks on the playing field but few in the managers chair or 
owners office the naacp said it is also mirrors the hollywood 
movie industry in which one or two black superstars generate 
tremendous box office for studios that have no black executives at 
the helm or in decisionmaking positions 
this doesnt mean much for charttopping artists such as jackson 
and houston their music gets heard regardless of whos working 
behind the scenes 
but it means a lot for artists such as vandross aretha franklin 
rick james and even stevie wonder theyre on the second echelon 
record company promotion people plug records by these musicians 
first at black radio stations if the records arent big hits on the 
black charts chances are they wont be heard on the radio stations 
that cater to a larger consumer group 
and having a hit on urban radio stations a euphemism for 
black audiences is no guarantee the record will cross over to 
pop charts thats a lesson newcomer vanessa williams learned very 
quickly when the right stuff hit no 1 on the black charts but 
couldnt dent the pop top 40 
i believe it could have been a much bigger hit on pop radio 
if i had more support promotionwise said williams a former miss 
america 
the question of whether black artists get pop hits is 
inextricably tied to the hiring patterns within the industry the 
highpowered music business jobs that decide where a company puts 
its promotional muscle are almost all filled by whites said 
billboards nelson george blacks are steered to the black music 
division of a record company he said 
most blacks are in the promotion area these are the ones that 
are calling on radio stations and are not necessarily in the 
mainstream of the business area of the company said lebaron 
taylor vice president and general manager for corporate affairs at 
cbs records 
very few black acts have longevity as pop artists said 
hervey who manages and is married to williams i cant think 
historically of any black artist who can consistently release albums 
and be successful on the pop charts without being successful on the 
black charts 
stevie wonder was at that point in the 1970s when he raked in 
awards and smash hits with ease but today the rock and roll hall 
of fame member has trouble getting on the pop charts 
stunted racial attitudes have even led to a few tragiccomic 
situations 
the detroit band was not was which has two whites and two 
blacks and play an eclectic mix of soul and rock was not allowed by 
its former record company to include pictures with promotional 
materials sent to radio stations 
they didnt want black radio to know there were white people 
involved with the band nor white people to see there were black 
people involved said band member david weiss currently riding 
high with the bands hit walk the dinosaur 
rick james super freak part 1 cant get his videos on 
mtv while black video stations have complained he has too many 
whites in his clips said his manager and brother leroi johnson 
for a good part of the 80s mtv refused to play videos of black 
artists saying they didnt fit with their rock format the practice 
ended when cbs records threatened to pull all its videos from the 
station if mtv didnt show michael jackson 
most record companies in america are looking to do what geffen 
records did with guns n roses weiss said theyre looking to 
find that band thats going to tear the heads off white america 
its a game of numbers 
many blacks are just as rigid in their views of what music should 
or shouldnt be as whites there was a lot of grumbling among 
blacks george said when george michael who is white had big hits 
on the black charts 
you may say theres a lot of segregation and stereotyping but 
a lot of the stereotyping is selfinflicted he said blacks 
cant keep blaming the white establishment a lot of it comes from 
the inside 
another problem is that successful black artists rarely bring 
other blacks into the business with them the naacps rasheed said 
also only a handful of major black artists have black managers 
no one in the industry disputed the naacp report but responses 
were left to the individual companies said trish heimers of the 
recording industry association of america 
however said rasheed the attitude of most record company 
executives was to ignore it and hope it goes away 
both warner bros records and cbs records have programs to 
advance minorities although both stressed it wasnt in response to 
the naacp report they also couldnt say how many blacks are 
employed 
i believe that it is healthier than the report indicates 
said tom draper vice president for community relations at warner 
bros 
but its important draper said not to let the success shown by 
grammy nominees deceive people into thinking total racial harmony 
has been achieved 
we need more tracy chapmans to break through more artists who 
dont conform to stereotypes george said thats really 
crucial the industry follows the artist

as the government fashions a 90 billion 
rescue for the savings and loan industry a bailout of the 525 
billion farm credit system has entered its second year costing a 
fraction of initial estimates 
a reviving farm economy supported by generous government subsidy 
payments to farmers has helped improve the outlook for what was 
once considered one of the riskiest federal rescue packages 
nevertheless some weeds still plague the 73yearold independent 
farm banking system and its 600000 borrowers 
the bleeding has stopped which is good to see said jeff 
plagge executive vice president of the first state bank of webster 
city iowa and a member of the state bankers associations 
agriculture committee 
but he said the farm credit system has ways to go before i 
think they are perceived by customers as a stable organization 
the system a network of rural banks and credit associations was 
created in 1916 to provide a reliable source of credit to farmers 
the only way for many to pay for the seed fertilizer weed killers 
and insecticides needed in the spring to get a crop in and carry a 
farm operation to the fall harvest 
we need it to survive we need it to be rehabilitated we need 
an institution people in agriculture can depend on for financing or 
were going to see bad days again said farmer reynold minski who 
raises cotton and soybeans near lake providence la 
at the beginning of 1987 after losing 46 billion over the 
previous two years the farm credit system sought 6 billion in 
government aid 
by the end of that year with signs of a revival in farm 
prosperity under way and systemwide losses cut to 17 million 
congress approved the agricultural credit act authorizing the sale 
of up to 28 billion in governmentbacked bonds to provide a 
capital infusion if that was not enough the system could ask 
congress for up to 12 billion more 
to date the system has borrowed 690 million just 115 percent 
of estimated needs only two years ago and 1725 percent of the 
maximum assistance authorized 
although the system eventually will have repay the money the 
us treasury will pay the interest on the debt now 649 million a 
year for the first five years of the 15year bonds and half the 
interest for the next five years before the system starts paying the 
interest itself 
still worrisome however is the uncertain longterm outlook for 
repayment of the principal given the roller coaster course of 
agriculture and the much bigger price tag associated with bailing 
out insolvent savings and loans 
who will repay the bonds that is the big question said son 
won song chief economist at norwest corp a minneapolis banking 
company 
money wasnt the only part of the farm credit system package 
a board created by congress to review assistance requests quickly 
closed the systems sickly banking operation in jackson miss 
because of what it called poor management many of the systems 
three dozen banks and hundreds of credit associations were 
consolidated 
other than the jackson situation most of the worst times are 
behind us said daniel bienz vice president for disclosure and 
reporting at the farm credit financial assistance corp a system 
subsidiary 
rep jim leach riowa a member of the house banking committee 
credits what he called generous government assistance with 
stabilizing the farm credit system despite the devastating drought 
of 1988 that otherwise would have made many struggling farmers even 
worse off than before 
the federal government rained dollars in the farm economy we 
didnt get natural rain we got manmade rain leach said 
that has some economists worried too given the clamor for 
budget cutting in washington and selection of farm programs as a 
likely target 
if there is a significant reduction in farm income the ability 
of farmers to repay is diminished said neil harl an agriculture 
economist at iowa state university 
harl said farm program payments accounted for 94 percent of 
illinois farm earnings in 1987 72 percent of iowas and 36 percent 
nationwide leaving agriculture vulnerable if federal support is cut 
marvin duncan acting chairman of the farm credit administration 
regulator of the system also expressed caution about the recovery 
overall the system turned profitable last year but earnings 
were not particularly high quality he says 
an upturn in farmland values increased the collateral backing 
many problem loans enabling banks systemwide to remove hundreds of 
millions of dollars from reserves set aside for possibly 
uncollectable debts 
in the fourstate omaha neb farm credit services district 
alone 271 million in provisions for bad loans were removed from 
the red ink side of the books in 1988 
the omaha district which covers iowa nebraska south dakota and 
wyoming intends to go a step beyond recovery it has suggested 
expanding into activities that include checking accounts credit 
cards and investment services 
its iowa office even has a small program that offers borrowers 
discounts when buying cars 
we went down the tubes because we were not diversified said 
john scherle district spokesman 
regulators and lawmakers are skeptical about such straying from 
the systems basic mission 
i think they are smoking something in omaha that isnt grown on 
the typical iowa soybean farm congressman leach said 
duncan at the farm credit administration said such programs 
probably must be approved by his agency and asked if you broaden 
the range of offerings do you bring additional risk to the financial 
stability of the institution 
bankers also are alarmed because of possible competition from 
federally subsidized farm credit agencies and the prospect of even 
more from sampls 
they had a record that indicated they couldnt adequately 
manage a loan portfolio now they want to take deposits said 
edward tubbs iowas banking superintendent 
with a fresh infusion of money farm credit banks have become 
fierce competitors for loans in many parts of the country leading 
to banker complaints of illegal predatory pricing the practice 
refers to loanmaking that undercuts interest rates offered by banks 
joseph daly president of the farley state bank in northeast 
iowa said his bank was about to refinance a mortgage at 11 percent 
interest in early february from a customer whod paid the farm 
credit system 127 percent for years 
when the farm credit office heard of the deal it offered to 
refinance the loan at 105 percent daly said

i dont see how you can cover costs at those rates or cover 
yourself for another crunch he said he also accused the system 
of arbitrary standards claiming it quoted 115 percent as its 
lowest rate to another farmer 
marlin jackson chairman of first state bank of conway ark 
said that while competition has intensified the farm credit system 
has not opened the floodgates like in the late 1970s when it 
encouraged farmers to expand at a time of rising inflation and 
interest rates 
many farmers later got caught with unmanageable debts when land 
values and farm prices collapsed in the early 1980s 
its highly competitive now for the best credits but its a 
step well short of cannibalistictype pricing jackson said 
jeff graves a vice president at central trust and savings in 
eldridge iowa said the governments assistance to the farm credit 
system is like a grandparent giving you free money to run a 
business 
but farm credit officials said they have new management practices 
as well as ground to regain from the banks after losing a big chunk 
of farm debt 
the farm credit system accounted for 334 percent of the total 
1927 billion in farm debt in 1983 but held 274 percent of a total 
debt of 1427 billion by the end of 1987 us agriculture 
department figures show while banks share rose from 236 percent 
to 287 percent 
bankers have no right to grouse said moe russell president of 
farm credit services of iowa 
ive got 99 credit officers around the state telling me the 
banks are undercutting us the point is the iowa farmer is the 
winner russell said 
duncan said his agencys investigations have not substantiated 
complaints of predatory pricing 
bankers meantime have an opportunity to win more longterm farm 
lending with the creation of the federal agricultural mortgage 
corp known as farmer mac its designed to create a market for 
farm mortgages the same way the federal national mortgage 
association fannie mae did for residential housing banks will 
be able to pool farm mortgages for resale to investors 
while the credit outlook may be brightening many farmers 
especially in the troubled jackson district of alabama louisiana 
and mississippi are complaining they cannot get loans 
the availability of credit is one of the hardest problems we 
face right now said hugh arant who raises cotton rice soybeans 
and catfish in ruleville miss 
duncan said money abounds for lending he also said farmers 
often badmouth their industry farmers are often the last to admit 
that improvements are occurring

smith amp wesson is trying to sell a new line of 
handguns to women but several leading womens magazines are 
refusing to carry the gunmakers advertisements for the petite 
ladysmith 38 revolvers 
we would not accept that category of advertising said john 
de holl director of advertising services for womans day magazine 
in new york it would be against the policy of the magazine to run 
any advertisements for firearms 
womans day is not alone smith amp wesson officials say new 
yorkbased conde nast publications including mademoiselle glamour 
and self and des moinesbased meredith groups better homes amp 
gardens all have rejected ads for the ladysmiths 
we do not accept handgun ads for any of our magazines even 
playboy said a representative of conde nasts west coast 
advertising firm who asked not to be identified playboy is not 
published by conde nast 
some publications i have approached have turned down the ads 
said michael shypula director of advertising and promotions for the 
springfield massbased gunmaker i think the bias is against the 
smith amp wesson namesince there are no guns in our ads 
smith amp wesson last month unveiled the new line of four handguns 
the ladysmiths at a trade show in dallas the guns all 
38caliber revolvers have been scaled down to better fit a 
womans hand 
shypula said advertisements for the guns will focus on public 
safety the ads will not feature pictures of the guns but rather 
illustrations of women in typical precrime situations stuck on 
the side of the road with car trouble or hearing a noise the middle 
of the night 
rather than carrying the name of the guns the ad will have a 
tollfree 800number smith amp wesson is setting up for women to talk 
to a female gun specialist about purchasing a handgun 
were using illustrations shypula said none of them show 
anyone in a dangerous situation a lot of our ads tell women to call 
the police

union carbide corp is paying millions less to 
settle claims from a chemical leak that killed thousands of people 
in india than drexel burnham lambert inc is paying for whitecollar 
crime on wall street 
to some legal experts the comparison between union carbides 
470 million payment and drexels 650 million settlement suggests 
that union carbide got off lightly while to others it indicates 
drexel was overpunished 
in either case differences in the treatment of carbide and 
drexel point up oddities in the way legal systems deal with 
allegations of corporate crime and negligence 
theres no doubt in anyones mind that the bhopal incident is 
more serious than the drexel burnham lambert case but whoever said 
that rationality prevails in the administration of justice said 
robert figlio adjunct professor of legal studies at the university 
of pennsylvanias wharton school 
carbide agreed tuesday to pay 470 million to the government of 
india in a surprise courtordered settlement resulting from the dec 
3 1984 gas leak at bhopal that killed more than 3300 people in 
the worlds worst industrial disaster 
activists in bhopal denounced the settlement as a betrayal of the 
20000 victims who still suffer from exposure to the deadly gas that 
escaped from a pesticide plant the government had sought 3 billion 
in damages 
in drexels case the wall street firm that pioneered junk 
bond financing agreed in december to pay 650 million in fines and 
restitution and to plead guilty to six felony accounts 
the plea bargain which awaits the approval of a federal court 
and the securities and exchange commission averted a lengthy trial 
over charges of insider trading and stock manipulation 
which corporation committed a more serious offense 
the national survey of crime severity which asked more than 
50000 americans in the late 1970s to rank offenses ranging from 
loitering to murderous bombing gives some hint that carbide would 
be considered the more serious offender 
pricefixing between large corporations a crime similar to 
drexels was given a relatively mild score of 92 in the survey 
willful pollution of a city water supply that resulted in 20 
deaths the closest approximation of carbides offense was rated 
extremely serious at 391 
several factors complicate the comparison however for one 
carbides chemical leak was not a willful act by senior management 
although prosecutors charged that the company was criminally 
derelict in its duty to ensure the plants safety 
the us government could get more out of drexel than the indian 
government could get out of carbide because it had more legal 
leverage over the company 
also 470 million goes a lot farther in india than it would in 
the united states differences in the cost of living amplify the 
actual value of carbides payment 
carbides average payment per life lost is about 140000 that 
is nearly 100 times as much as an indian court had ever ordered in 
payment for deaths in cases that involved government such as train 
wrecks according to curtis tarr dean of cornell universitys 
johnson graduate school of management 
tarr said he had no figures on cases involving liability of 
private entities 
the difference between the cases is that carbide has always 
sensed a responsibility and wanted to do what they could tarr 
said in the drexel thing you have quite a different situation 
where some people were operating in a kind of a gray area of 
legality 
drexel might have gotten off more lightly five or 10 years ago 
before revelations about ef hutton amp co dennis levine ivan 
boesky and others caused a wave of public outrage over insider 
dealings on wall street 
today figlio said youve got a whole buildup of sentiment 
against that activity in all levels of society

dual trading is a misunderstood and essential 
element of the commodity futures markets and its potential for 
abuse can be offset by closer surveillance say top officials of the 
chicago board of trade 
dual trading the practice among floor brokers of trading both 
for their own accounts and those of brokeragefirm customers has 
long been cited by critics as a potential source of fraud 
the debate has heated up since the revelation jan 19 of a broad 
federal investigation of suspected trading fraud at the chicago 
board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
but board of trade chairman karsten mahlmann and president thomas 
donovan said tuesday that dual trading helps ensure active liquid 
markets by providing an incentive for floor brokers to stay in the 
pits and trade when the flow of orders from the public runs slow 
federal rules require brokers to execute all their pending 
customer orders before trading for their own accounts thus giving 
customers the first crack at profiting from price fluctuations 
mahlmann said the exchanges board of directors voted to 
tentatively retain dual trading a decision announced last week 
because through the expansion of the surveillance system we could 
eliminate any and all potential abuses of dual trading and keep the 
benefit 
the rival chicago mercantile exchange is still considering making 
changes in its trading rules including dual trading 
theres nothing wrong with dual trading per se donovan said 
the problem is when someone would trade ahead of a customer and 
we can detect that abuse 
the board of trade hopes to better detect such abuses through a 
1 million upgrade this year of its computerized trade 
reconstruction system an electronic system that officials estimate 
can now catch about 90 percent of all improper trades the goal is 
100 percent 
on another matter mahlmann said he was not involved in the 
hiring by his own brokerage firm of two salesmen who have since been 
indicted on fraud charges 
the two salesmen michael n kolb and jan y biesiadecki were 
indicted by a federal grand jury jan 17 on charges they defrauded 
investors while working for first commodity corp of boston a 
futures brokerage firm that collapsed in 1986 after its expulsion 
from the midamerica commodity exchange a board of trade affiliate 
sixteen other former first commodity employees also were indicted 
mahlmann is the chairman of stotler amp co a large chicagobased 
commodity futures brokerage that hired kolb and biesiadecki last 
year according to records of the national futures association a 
selfregulatory arm of the futures industry 
kolb hired in march 1988 still works for stotler biesiadecki 
hired in november 1988 left stotler on jan 24 and is currently not 
registered with the national futures association 
the hirings of former first commodity salesmen by stotler and by 
rbamph inc a brokerage firm headed by a highranking executive of 
the chicago mercantile exchange have raised questions about the 
industrys ability to police itself 
mahlmann said board of trade activities had consumed almost 100 
percent of his time over the past two years and that he had not 
been involved with individual hirings at stotler during that time 
he also said all salespeople hired by stotler had been registered 
with the national futures association which is funded by the 
nations 11 futures exchanges through a pertrade fee on public 
transactions and carries a federal mandate to screen and register 
all commodities salespeople 
as a brokerage firm there is a reliance that goes with the 
registration he said 
but robert wilmouth president and chief executive officer of the 
chicagobased association said hiring decisions ultimately are made 
by brokerage firms 
rbamph is headed by john f sandner the immediate past chairman of 
the chicago merc who now holds the title of senior policy adviser 
at the exchange 
rbamph employed at least three former first commodity salesmen last 
year all of whom left the firm before they were indicted 
sandner has said he was not directly involved in the hirings and 
that his firm has not had any customer complaints relating to their 
activities

union carbide corps 470 million 
settlement with the indian government over the 1984 bhopal gas leak 
pleased wall street but was criticized by a prominent attorney who 
originally was involved in the case 
they got off criminally cheap said melvin belli the 
attorney who represented the interests of about 2000 plaintiffs 
before the cases were transferred from us courts to india 
we had that amount of money two years ago in new york and it 
wasnt enough and it isnt enough belli said tuesday in a 
telephone interview from san francisco he added that he thought two 
or three times the 470 million would have been fairer 
the stock market however was delighted by the settlement which 
was ordered by the supreme court of india sitting in new delhi 
union carbides stock price soared 212 to 3125 a share in 
new york stock exchange trading after news of the settlement and the 
companys estimate that it expected a relatively mild impact on its 
earnings from the agreement 
the indian court ordered the danburybased chemical company to 
make payment by march 31 thereby settling all claims resulting from 
the leak of deadly methyl isocyanate at the bhopal pesticide plant 
which was operated by union carbides indian subsidiary 
more than 3300 people died as a result of the dec 2 1984 
leak the worlds worst industrial disaster the plant has been 
closed since the accident 
the indian government sued union carbide for 3 billion in 
damages claiming company negligence caused the leak union carbide 
maintains that sabotage by a disgruntled employee was to blame 
the company said it expected an earnings impact of no more than 
50 cents a share from the settlement 
in the year ended dec 31 union carbide earned 720 million or 
531 a share on revenue of 832 billion that compared to 1987 
earnings of 231 million or 176 a share on revenue of 691 
billion 
psychologically its terrific financially its reasonable 
said leslie ravitz a research director for salomon brothers inc in 
new york this relieves the pressure on union carbide and the 
stigma 
james wilbur a vice president with smith barney harris upham amp 
co inc in new york said union carbide has set aside 200 million 
toward the settlement and had 250 million in insurance coverage 
leaving it at risk for another 20 million under tuesdays 
settlement 
i think its a decision that was pretty much anticipated he 
said of the settlement 
union carbide had offered to pay the indian victims 350 million 
as early as 1986 that settlement was accepted by us courts but 
rejected in india 
us district judge john f keegan ruled in may 1986 that all 
claims filed against union carbide by individuals and the indian 
government should be transferred to india 
under tuesdays settlement the indian government also will 
dismiss all criminal charges brought against the company and at 
least nine present or former union carbide employees including 
former chairman warren m anderson who was charged with culpable 
homicide 
anderson who maintains an office at union carbide headquarters 
did not return telephone calls tuesday seeking comment 
in a statement union carbide chairman robert d kennedy said 
we are pleased that this will now provide for the care and 
rehabilitation of the victims and their families and a fair 
resolution of all issues 
had the settlement not been reached the alternative is 
litigation that probably would have extended into the next century 
with the final outcome that would be completely irrelevant to the 
interests of the affected people in bhopal and a continuing drain on 
carbide said company spokesman earl j slack 
richard grand founder of the inner circle of advocates a group 
of more than 100 liability attorneys who have won 
multimilliondollar damage awards for clients in personal injury or 
death cases said it would be irresponsible to speculate on how much 
bhopal victims could have won in us courts 
american lawyers should let india judge whats fair he said 
from tuscon ariz

pennwalt corp which has agressively spurned 
centaur partners advances since the group announced eight months 
ago it wanted to take over the chemical company now says it will 
consider a 110 per share offer 
centaur announced its increased offer tuesday morning after the 
stock market closed pennwalt came back with its answer 
pennwalt chairman edwin e tuttle said in a letter to centaur 
that the company would call a special board of directors meeting to 
consider the increased offer 
centaur had offered 100 a share for the company in middecember 
in a deal valued at 698 million the offer was to expire feb 22 
tuesdays offer is estimated at 869 million 
tuttle said the board also will consider a date for a special 
stockholder meeting called by centaur and other stockholders 
centaur has said it intends to try to fire pennwalts board of 
directors and install its own board to approve the tender offer 
the increased offer due to expire march 1 came four days after 
a federal judge denied a pennwalt request to block the stockholders 
meeting 
pennwalts stock closed at 11312 tuesday up 737 from 
monday 
pennwalts stock was trading at about 70 per share when centaur 
an investor group with offices in new york and bethesda md 
launched its takeover bid 
to fend off the takeover attempt pennwalt sold its 
pharmaceutical division and most of its equipment business and 
bought back about 40 percent of its outstanding shares for 85 each 
most recently pennwalt lobbied the pennsylvania legislature for 
protection hoping lawmakers would view the company as a victim of 
the recent takeover frenzy 
in an effort to thwart pennwalts defense efforts centaur whose 
stake in the philadelphiabased company has increased to 17 percent 
since middecember called for the meeting 
centaur said it has solicited support from shareholders 
representing 346 percent of the common shares believed to be 
outstanding more than the 20 percent required under pennsylvania 
state law to call such a meeting 
michael brinn a senior vice president of the carter 
organization which tracks shareholder investments testified in 
federal court that arbitrageurs who hope to make shortterm profits 
in takeover attempts owned about 40 percent of the outstanding 
shares as of november 
centaur said its increased offer would be funded from an 
additional 10 million equity investment to be made by centaurs 
partners and from previously disclosed financing to be provided by a 
syndicate of banks and the investment firm of painewebber inc

the international finance corp will invest at 
least 200 million in private mexican companies by the end of this 
fiscal year primarily to refinance individual foriegn debts an 
official of the world bank affiliate said tuesday 
not only does the mexican government have a major foreign debt 
problem but so do many mexican companies corporation vice 
president william ryrie said at a news conference one of the 
things we do is to help various private companies restructure their 
finances and liberate them from the financial burdens that have kept 
them from expanding 
ryrie said the corporations investment in mexico this fiscal 
year includes 145 million already appropriated to polimar a 
plastics export firm and a 60 million line of credit granted for 
restructuring of the government controlled banca serfin 
he said most other investments planned for mexico during the 
remainder of fiscal 198889 are still in negotiations and he would 
not say what other companies would be involved 
the corporation was formed to boost economic development through 
privatesector investment 
helmut paul the corporations director of latin american 
investments said future investments in mexico will benefit 
companies producing petrochemicals household appliances automobile 
parts and hotels 
paul said those petrochemical companies are small private firms 
making such things as plastics from petroleum derivatives and do not 
include pemex the government oil monopoly 
ryrie was in mexico to review corporation programs and meet with 
federal officials including treasury secretary pedro aspe 
mr aspe and his collegues have encouraged us to expand our 
activities here and we expect to have a close relationship with the 
new presidential administration ryrie said president carlos 
salinas de gortari took office in december 
our activities in mexico are growing very fast ryrie added 
he said the corporation already has invested 375 million in 27 
companies nationwide 
the corporation will continue investing at least 200 million in 
mexico each year in the future he said 
much of that money will be used to restructure private companies 
foreign debts ryrie said 
in 1988 the corporation used an 80 million loan to help the 
visa group of monterrey slash its foreign debt from 17 billion to 
400 million the groups principal holdings are breweries 
including dos equis beer 
visas restructuring included a variety of alternative 
refinancing methods including debtforequity exchanges in which a 
debtor uses equity to pay off outstanding debts 
mexico should examine similar alternative refinancing methods to 
reduce its 106 billion foreign debt ryrie said 
ryrie said that despite its economic troubles the adjustment 
mexico has made in the last year of crisis has been an impressive 
one and one that should be respected 
the recent expansion of nonoil exports is important as is the 
new liberalization of previous trade policies he added 
ryrie also praised the governments recent push to reprivatize 
some governmentheld companies and said the corporation is willing 
to help in the sale of additional stateowned companies to the 
private sector

automakers suffered a 15 percent drop in sales of 
domesticmade cars and light trucks in early february over a year 
ago reflecting rising interest rates and declining incentives 
the companies reported tuesday that during the feb 110 period 
they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 27770 compared with 
a rate of 32749 during the same time in 1988 
car sales were off 18 percent led by chrysler corps drop of 
nearly 31 percent and light truck sales fell by 10 percent 
the decline occurred partly because there were more enticing 
incentives being offered in the market during early february last 
year incentives are available now but only on a smaller number of 
cars than in early february a year ago 
interest rates also have crept up since early february last year 
i think the recent rise in interest rates have hurt sales a 
little bit said analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co of 
new york also they finished 88 on a very strong note 
so far this year car and light truck sales are off 44 percent 
going to a daily rate of 31257 from a rate of 32686 car sales are 
down 77 percent while light truck sales have risen 19 percent so 
far this year 
chrysler said its car sales fell 309 percent during early 
february to a daily rate of 2200 from a rate of 3185 in the same 
period last year chryslers truck sales fell 51 percent to a daily 
rate of 2398 in early february from a rate of 2528 at the same 
time last year 
so far this year chryslers car sales are 136 percent lower 
than they were last year but truck sales are 77 percent ahead of 
last years pace 
gm car sales fell 23 percent during early february to a daily 
rate of 8355 compared with a rate of 10856 in early february 
1988 trucks made by gm in the united states sold at a daily rate of 
4040 during the first 10 days of the month down 13 percent from 
the 4643 daily rate during early february last year 
for the year gm has sold 143 percent fewer cars this year than 
last year and 23 percent fewer trucks 
ford said its early february car sales slipped 95 percent to a 
daily rate of 5557 from last years rate of 6143 ford truck sales 
fell by 113 percent during the period to a rate of 3596 compared

westinghouse electric corp and abb asea brown 
boveri ltd of switzerland are going ahead with planned joint 
ventures following a proposed settlement of a federal antitrust 
action 
the justice department filed both the antitrust lawsuit and 
proposed settlement tuesday at federal court in manhattan 
westinghouse and abb later announced they have established joint 
ventures in the electrical transmission and distribution equipment 
markets of the united states brazil and argentina 
the justice department had sued to block the ventures proposed 
last april claiming they posed significant threats to competition 
in us markets for power transformers converter transformers 
steam turbine generator equipment and services 
in january charles f rule assistant attorney general in charge 
of the antitrust division said reduced competition would likely 
mean higher electric rates for all users of electricity and higher 
prices for many products manufactured using electricity 
under the proposed settlement the justice department withdrew 
its objections to the joint ventures in return for abbs agreement 
to divest its waukesha wis transformer plant and related assets 
one of the joint ventures establishes the westinghouse abb power 
tampd co with westinghouse owning 55 percent and abb 45 percent the 
newly formed company will consist of westinghouse and abbs 
manufacturing plants and engineering and marketing organizations of 
their us transmission and distribution businesses 
under separate agreement abb based in zurich switzerland also 
has acquired 45 percent of the stock of certain westinghouse 
subsidiaries in brazil and argentina 
but as part of the settlement with the justice department 
westinghouse must sell its technology for designing and making 
converter transformers used by electric utilities to convert 
electricity to different voltages for efficient long distance 
transmission 
in its previous objection to the venture the justice department 
claimed the combined power transformer sales of westinghouse and abb 
would exceed 50 percent of total us sales which were more than 
400 million in 1988 
the settlement also bars both concerns from completing their 
previously announced joint venture in the steam turbine generator 
business for 10 years 
westinghouse and abb are two of only four significant sellers of 
major turbine generator repair and related services to us 
utilities along with general electric and utility power corp a 
subsidiary of siemens ag of west germany rule said us sales of 
steam turbine generators and the related services are estimated at 
over 600 million per year 
pittsburghbased westinghouse had 125 billion in sales in 1988 
and employs about 120000 people 
abb asea brown boveri ltd was created jan 1 1988 with the 
merger of asea ab of sweden and bbc brown boveri ltd of 
switzerland abb had 1988 sales of about 18 billion and 180000 
employees worldwide 
combined annual sales of the joint ventures are expected to be 
about 1 billion the operations employ about 10000 and will 
involve 20 westinghouse and three abb facilities in the us and

american semiconductor makers are selling more in 
japan but still face a psychological barrier in efforts to 
expand their market share a representative of the usbased 
semiconductor industry association said wednesday 
since the united states slapped 300 million in sanctions on 
japan in april 1987 saying it had violated a semiconductor trade 
pact the government and the countrys largest chip makers have 
tried to increase the foreign market share said david metz tokyo 
representative of the american trade group 
but metz told the foreign correspondents club of japan that 
changes in attitudes and practice have not been farreaching 
enough he said the biggest barrier is that many japanese 
semiconductor users are not accustomed to doing business with 
nonjapanese suppliers and are especially reluctant to deal with any 
but the largest and most wellknown foreign companies 
the record during the last 1 years under the semiconductor 
trade agreement clearly reflects efforts of the electronics industry 
association of japan and others to increase foreign access to the 
japanese market metz said 
but the changes in practice have not filtered throughout the 
industry he said we have to see a broader basis for increased 
market share in japan the top five companies are not extensive 
enough 
foreign market share in japan reached its lowest point in 1986 at 
84 percent and rose to 12 percent in the fourth quarter of last 
year 
the united states says that japan and the united states agreed in 
1986 that the us share of japans market should be about 20 
percent in the absence of barriers the japanese say they promised 
market access but not guaranteed market share 
we are no longer arguing that there are any formal or 
legislative barriers but there is a psychological barrier metz 
said 
us officials imposed the unprecedented sanctions after accusing 
japan of dumping selling computer chips at unfairly low prices 
and not meeting pledges that the foreign share of japans market 
would grow 
the sanctions were in the form of special duties on imports from 
japan and half were lifted in june 1987 when the united states 
said it no longer could find evidence of dumping 
but 165 million in sanctions remain and metz said the sia does 
not want them lifted yet 
we wont advocate the sanctions be dropped because we want to 
make sure that south korea taiwan hong kong and singapore know 
there shouldnt be any dumping at all metz said 
the world market for semiconductors is expected to soften in 1989 
and metz said the real test of progress for foreign producers in 
japan will be whether foreign firms are the first dropped by 
japanese users 
japanese producers captured half of the worlds semiconductor 
market last year and enjoy an 89 percent share of their domestic 
market

us oil imports soared to more than 8 million 
barrels per day in january for the first time since 1980 as demand 
rose sharply and domestic production continued to dwindle an 
industry trade group said today 
the american petroleum institute which represents major oil 
producers anday outside 
government buildings to denounce the 470 million compensation 
payment ordered by the supreme court 
we want justice and hang anderson they shouted 
referring to former union carbide corp chairman warren anderson 
the government has shaken hands with union carbide whose hands 
are dipped in the blood of our brothers and sisters one woman in 
the crowd of about 200 cried 
the demonstration was organized by the bhopal gashit womens 
front one of several groups that accused the government of making a 
deal with union carbide the government had sought 3 billion 
compensation for the gas leak which according to the government 
killed at least 3329 people 
some survivors said they were glad a financial settlement was 
finally reached but they thought union should be punished 
we have often been promised money but for us it was more 
important that those who killed our brothers and sisters should be 
hanged said sunil kumar 15 whose parents and five siblings died 
when methyl isocyanate escaped from a pesticide plant owned by union 
carbides indian subsidiary 
on tuesday the supreme court of india ended four years of legal 
wrangling and ordered union carbide of danbury conn to pay 470 
million to the government 
the news was slow to sink in at the jai prakash nagar shantytown 
across the road from the deserted union carbide plant which closed 
after the dec 3 1984 leak 
kumar still lives with a younger brother in the shack where his 
family slept as the white killing vapor wafted across the teeming 
settlement 
this morning he was studying for high school examinations one 
of the few teenagers in the shantytown who can afford not to work 
he achieved this relative affluence soon after the disaster when 
the indian government gave nextofkin 10000 rupees then worth 
833 for each gas death in the family kumar received 70000 rupees 
many people seemed unable to comprehend what the settlement would 
mean for them 
one man shanker lal said there had been promises of money in 
the past but he had yet to receive anything 
at a hospital near the camp shaukat bai a veiled woman in her 
mid20s waited for treatment for respiratory problems blamed on the 
gas pregnant at the time of the disaster she lost her unborn child 
in a miscarriage health workers blamed on the gas her husband was 
killed by the gas 
union carbide should have been stripped of its assets she 
said she said she thought pregnant women who suffered miscarriages 
or gave birth to stillborn babies should be given compensation 
local politicians who crusaded on the victims behalf were more 
vehement 
the rajiv gandhi government has committed an inhuman crime by 
undermining the extent of the disaster giriraj kishore president 
of the slum dwellers federation said referring to the prime 
minister and his congress party 
satinath sarangi a scientist and member of the bhopal group for 
information and action said this settlement is the final 
testimony to the antipeople collusion between the government of 
india and the union carbide corp 
alok pratap singh a leader of the poisonous gas episode struggle 
front that often organized anticarbide demonstrations called the 
470 million agreement a shameless settlement 
vibhuti jha a young lawyer for the front said the government 
had committed a criminal offense by agreeing to drop criminal 
charges against union carbide its indian subsidiary and corporate 
officials 
anderson chairman at the time of the gas leak and eight 
officials of union carbide of india ltd were charged in 1987 with 
culpable homicide in the disaster 
they never appeared for trial and the supreme court quashed the 
charges when it ordered union carbide to pay the full and final 
settlement 
dainik bhaskar a bhopal daily newspaper called the settlement 
niggardly and inadequate and said it set a dangerous precedent 
for the third world where people are considered guinea pigs by the 
multinationals

the nations factories mines and utilities in 
january operated at 844 percent of capacity a level that has not 
been surpassed for nearly a decade the government reported today 
the federal reserve board said januarys operating rate was 
unchanged from december for which the figure was revised upward 
from an earlier estimate of 842 percent 
the operating rate for january and december has not been 
surpassed since october 1979 when factories were functioning at 
846 percent of capacity 
as capacity use rises so do fears that factories will have 
trouble keeping up with orders leading to shortages and price 
increases and adding to inflationary pressures 
the fed since last march has been nudging interest rates upward 
in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflation in check 
in a second report today the federal reserve said industrial 
production climbed 03 percent in january following a revised 
increase of 05 percent in december 
a pickup in the production of both manufacturing and commercial 
equipment during the month more than offset a decline in output of 
transit equipment 
the feds industrial production index stands at 1411 percent of 
its 1977 base 5 percent higher than a year earlier 
at manufacturing plants the operating rate rose to 848 percent 
last month up from 846 percent in december capacity for durable 
goods big ticket items expected to last more than three years 
rose 01 percentage points to 833 percent while capacity for 
nondurable goods increased by 03 percentage points to 869 percent 
use of motor vehicles and parts manufacturing capacity was down a 
hefty 41 percentage points to 757 percent 
the january operating rate at utilities was 804 percent down 
from 81 percent a month earlier 
in the mining sector which includes oil and gas drilling the 
operating rate was down 08 percentage points to 825 percent the 
decrease reflected a substantial drop in coal output and oil and gas 
extraction 
production in the manufacturing sector rose 05 percent in 
january matching a december increase while output from mines and 
utilities declined 
within manufacturing production increased for all major 
industries except transportation equipment and paper 
automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 75 million 
units down from 79 million in december

sunshine mining co said it has abandoned 
plans to acquire rexene corp a dallasbased plastics and 
petrochemical maker in a reported 896 million deal 
we cannot reach agreement with the sellers on price and 
terms sunshine chief financial officer joseph denahan said 
sunshine said in december that the company known primarily for 
silver mining and natural gas production with major operations in 
the idaho panhandle would pay 28 a share for rexene common stock in 
cash and securities 
the proposal raised concern among some investors over how 
sunshine would finance the deal amid continuous losses the last four 
years 
sunshine chairman michael boswell had said the company wanted to 
obtain a third line of business related to natural resources but 
countercyclical to oil gas and precious metals 
i think our strategy continues as it has been and that is to 
try to expand our precious metals and oil and gas business both 
internally and through acquisition denahan said 
rexene through its subsidiary rexene products co makes 
thermoplastic resins and petrochemical products 
its products are used in many household goods including food 
packaging toys linings for disposable diapers and styrene for 
production of disposable cups and other containers

james t sherwin keeps a chess board in his 
office at gaf corp with the white pieces arranged in a cautious 
opening strategy known as the samish variation against the kings 
indian defense 
careful analytical a risktaker only when odds are good 
sherwins chess style doesnt square with the charges against him in 
federal court that he broke federal law by trying to manipulate the 
price of a companys stock 
once the thirdranked us chess player and still a prominent 
figure in the chess world the gaf vice chairman faces reallife 
checkmate as a key defendant in the first jury trial emanating from 
the wall street insider trading scandal he has denied the charges 
and vowed to vindicate himself in court but if convicted on all 
counts sherwin could get 50 years in prison and fines up to 25 
million 
you walk into an office and you see a chess set and you wonder 
if he beat himself said charles j rose an analyst with the 
oppenheimer amp co investment firm who knows sherwin personally 
in a recent session of the trial in us district court in lower 
manhattan sherwin sat intently at the defense table scrutinizing 
damning testimony by boyd l jefferies a disgraced stockbroker and 
admitted felon who is the governments key witness in the gaf case 
jefferies alleged sherwin asked him by telephone in october 1986 
to buy union carbide corp stock in order to artificially inflate 
the price and that sherwin agreed to compensate him for any losses 
under federal securities laws the telephone calls alone would have 
been illegal 
the purpose of the alleged deal was to maximize gafs gain from 
the sale of its holding in carbide stock after a failed takeover of 
the much larger chemical company 
friends corporate analysts and chess colleagues were dumbfounded 
when sherwin was indicted along with gaf last july saying the 
charges belie his character 
hes as likely to do something dishonest as he is to flap his 
arms and fly home across the hudson river said allen kaufman 
executive director of the american chess foundation who has known 
sherwin for 40 years 
the funniest thing about this thing is i cant imagine jim 
sherwin doing what he has allegedly done added chemical industry 
analyst mark gulley of dean witter reynolds inc it just does not 
add up 
sherwin 55 declined through his lawyers to be interviewed 
during the trial but associates describe him as deeply analytical 
articulate selfeffacing and cautious both in the office and behind 
a chess board 
at gaf he was known as a effective administrator who played a 
lesser role in major expenditures chess players extoll what they 
call his integrity honesty and intense calm 
last year when the marshall chess club in manhattan was 
embroiled in a votefraud dispute during board elections members 
turned to sherwin as an arbiter another time colleagues recall 
sherwin gave free legal defense to a club member involved in a 
fistfight over a chess game 
sherwin grew up in the bronx playing chess from an early age he 
entered columbia college at age 16 and went to law school there at 
age 21 sherwin and kaufman hitchhiked crosscountry to play in a 
tournament in california 
golombeks encyclopedia of chess includes a listing on sherwin 
describing him as a leading american international master in the 
1950s and 1960s 
sherwin tied for fifth in the 1953 world junior championships and 
placed 17th in a world championships preliminary five years later in 
a tournament that included playing companion bobby fischer who went 
on to become the worlds best player fischer included a 1957 game 
against sherwin in his book my 60 memorable games 
in the late1950s sherwin placed third in the us championships 
two years running but after that his results fluctuated according 
to golombeks and he rarely played competitively after 1968 
choosing business over chess 
he doubtlessly would have gone to the top had he chosen chess 
as a profession kaufman said 
his style is assertive determined but sound he said he 
wont go off on the flights of fancy the way lesser players do he 
analyzes very very accurately and deeply and always gets into time 
pressure because of that 
the description also applies to sherwins business style in 1960 
he joined gaf the wayne njbased maker of specialty chemicals 
and building materials that also owns wncnfm in new york he 
patiently rose through the corporate ranks under the tutelage of 
jesse werner gafs prior chairman 
in the early1980s sherwin led a failed fight to prevent a 
takeover of gaf by the current chairman samuel j heyman according 
to analysts he left the company in 1983 for a senior post at 
triangle industries inc just before heyman triumphed but returned 
a year later after assiduous courting by heyman 
analysts said sherwin has played a principal role in law 
accounting tax and staff support matters that helped increase 
profits and raise the companys stature 
he showed heyman how to make the company profitable analyst 
rose said 
though he no longer plays chess competitively sherwin is 
president of the american chess foundation offers chess analysis on 
public television for world championship matches and stops by the 
marshall chess club to play as recently as a few weeks ago 
he always wants to find out what the right move is he wants to 
find out the truth of the chess position said shelby lyman a 
syndicated chess columnist who has hosted championship broadcasts 
with sherwin six times since 1978 
hes a guy who would do his own income tax and never cheat 
hes been so successful all his life just playing by the rules 
lyman said

secretary of state james a baker iii says he 
will sell his large stock holdings in a major international lender 
after questions were raised about the potential for conflicts of 
interest 
baker said tuesday he will sell his stock in chemical new york 
corp which has lent 45 billion to third world nations as well 
as all other publicly traded stocks held in a qualified blind trust 
members of congress had expressed surprise when bakers stock 
holdings were publicized last week noting that as treasury 
secretary under president reagan he made decisions affecting the 
third world debt crisis the same issue confronts him as secretary 
of state in the bush administration 
bakers promise to get rid of the stocks was hailed tuesday at 
the white house where president bushs ethics chief had questioned 
bakers holdings under a new stringent interpretation of government 
ethics rules 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater issued a statement 
saying baker has gone even further than required to insure there 
is not even the perception of a conflict of interest 
the controversy revolved primarily around bakers holdings in 
chemical new york 
while heading the treasury department in the reagan 
administration baker developed the socalled baker plan which 
called on third world nations to make good on their debts as they 
restructured their sagging economies it called for new public and 
private lending but it did not attempt to force the banks to 
forgive the loans 
as bushs chief adviser on foreign policy baker will be forced 
to deal with the same nagging problem of the indebted nations which 
owe billions to western and other commercial banks 
baker initially had said he would seek a conflictofinterest 
waiver on third world issues from the white house but on tuesday 
with increasing attention being focused on the issue he said he 
would instruct the trustees in charge of the bank stocks to sell 
them 
baker made the announcement during a visit to nato nations a 
baker spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the publicly traded 
stocks held by his wife susan and those held for their minor 
daughter mary bonner baker also will be sold 
baker said the decision went well beyond what was required by 
law 
bakers holdings were in a qualified blind trust in 1981 when he 
was serving as reagans white house chief of staff 
a trustee was in control of the stocks but under the law baker 
knew what he had put into the trust and was barred from taking 
action involving those specific items until the trustee told him 
they were either sold or worth less than 1000 
i think it is the correct decision for someone committed to 
meeting the highest ethical standards baker said in an 
announcement distributed to reporters as he flew to rome from athens 
the size of bakers blind trust and the market value of stocks 
that will be sold were not disclosed 
however bakers latest financial disclosure form filed with the 
office of government ethics in january put a value of over 
250000 on the assets in the trust 
the form shows that the secretary received over 100000 in 
income from the trust during the time that was covered january 
through august of 1988 baker left the treasury department last 
summer to help thenvice president bushs campaign for the oval 
office 
the disclosure form also lists the separate property of mrs 
baker which includes 1087 shares in houston industries with a 
valuation between 15001 and 50000 
the report listed assets of daughter mary as including 5310 
shares of chemical new york corp 196 shares of exxon corp with a 
value listed between 5001 and 15000 144 shares of houston 
industries with a value listed between 1001 and 5000 and 330 
shares in trinity petroleum trust with a value listed between 
5001 and 15000 
bakers bank stocks originally were in texas commerce bancshares 
a holding company that grew out of a bank organized by bakers 
grandfather 
in may 1987 texas commerce was merged with a subsidiary of 
chemical and baker became a large holder of the new york 
corporations stock 
state department spokesman charles e redman said last week that 
the white house had undertaken a review of bakers holdings because 
of a more stringent interpretation of government ethics rules based 
on a 1987 justice department opinion 
the office of government ethics interpreting the opinion 
requires officials to be more conservative than previously 
believed necessary by government ethics attorneys redman said 
baker told reporters last week hed not spoken with white house 
ethics chief c boyden gray but that gray raised the subject of 
selling the chemical stocks with robert kimmit a washington lawyer 
recently named as bakers undersecretary of state for political 
affairs 
at that time baker said he would seek a conflictofinterest 
waiver permitting him to participate in decisions affecting the 
economies of developing nations 
but ms tutwiler said baker never asked the white house for the 
waiver 
meanwhile a congressional source speaking on condition he not 
be identified said the senate foreign relations committee asked 
baker last week for more information about his holdings 
the committee had approved bakers nomination for the state 
department post shortly before bushs inauguration 
now that baker has decided to sell his stocks the issue may be 
moot the source said

a government study says the domestic oil 
industry can meet the nations wartime fuel needs despite the 
financial distress it has suffered in recent years from falling oil 
prices and rising imports 
the militarys wartime fuel needs could be met by a combination 
of domestic oil production imports from reliable suppliers and the 
strategic petroleum reserve the governments underground stockpile 
of 555 million barrels the commerce department study said 
it added that forced curtailment of fuel use by the general 
public during wartime would result in serious economic hardships 
our analysis concludes that the united states will be able to 
meet direct and indirect military petroleum requirements during a 
major conventional war said the report released tuesday 
the report was prepared by the commerce departments bureau of 
export administration at the request of a coalition of energy 
industry groups which asserted in a petition that the domestic oil 
industry has been so damaged by rising imports that it could not 
meet the militarys fuel needs in the event of a major war 
in rejecting the industry groups claim the commerce department 
said the group had underestimated the extent to which fuel use in 
the private sector could be reduced in the event of a national 
defense mobilization and an actual military conflict 
the report said civilian use of fuel could be reduced by more 
than the 10 percent assumed by the industry group 
meanwhile an industry trade group said us oil imports soared 
to more than 8 million barrels per day in january for the first time 
since 1980 as demand rose sharply and domestic production continued 
to dwindle 
the american petroleum institute which represents major oil 
producers and refiners said us oil production fell to 79 million 
barrels a day a 34 percent drop from january 1988 
imports of oil surged to an average of 82 million barrels a day 
an increase of 206 percent over the january 1988 level of 68 
million barrels it was the first month that imports averaged more 
than 8 million barrels since 1980 the api said 
the commerce department report recommended a series of actions 
aimed at improving us energy security these included 
removing the remaining controls on the price of natural gas 
this would be expected to increase use of natural gas thus helping 
reduce the need for oil imports 
permit oil exploration and development on the arctic national 
wildlife refuge coastal plain in alaska and on the outer continental 
shelf the industry considers these the most promising domestic oil 
prospects although opponents say drilling in these areas would 
cause too much environmental damage 
providing greater tax incentives for independent oil drillers 
all three recommendations are contained as well in president 
bushs 1990 budget 
the report assumed 1987 levels of domestic oil production or 
about 83 million barrels a day output last year fell to about 82 
million barrels daily and the energy department foresees an 
accelerating decline in the 1990s 
domestic oil production has been declining since 1986 when world 
oil prices collapsed from about 30 a barrel to below 10 a barrel 
prices currently are in a range of 1517 a barrel which the 
nations oil producers contend is too low to prevent a further drop 
in production and rise in imports 
the energy department said last month that oil imports currently 
running at about 38 percent of total oil supplies would jump above 
50 percent by 1994 and could approach 60 percent before the end of 
the century 
the commerce report said the nation was better prepared for an 
energy crisis than in 1979 when a brief pinch on iranian oil 
supplies sent world oil prices soaring but that nevertheless 
petroleum imports threaten to impair the national security 
jim groninger director of governmental affairs for the 
independent petroleum association of america said his group was 
disappointed in the reports outcome 
it came to the right conclusions in that there is a national 
security issue here but it didnt take the next logical step in 
promoting a serious set of solutions groninger said

a lot of english wine should never have been made 
admits the head of the english vineyards association 
or if its made it shouldnt be drunk and certainly not sold 
for money says retired british navy commander geoffrey bond 
but having said that there is far far less proportionately 
bad english wine than almost anybody elses 
english wine 
yes this land of lager lovers and sherry sippers has a 
burgeoning domestic wine industry 
even fans admit it will never never push the great european 
vintages off the shelves mainly because few grape varieties can 
survive thrive and ripen in the cold wet climate 
but englands 360 vineyards did produce 108500 gallons of wine 
in 1987 and the industry gets about 10 percent bigger every year 
bond said 
most english wines are white and more sweet than dry theyre 
best as aperitifs or accompaniments to white meat fruit and salads 
there is a very clean and distinct crispness a fresh crispness 
about english wine which follows a very flowery bouquet bond 
said there is perhaps a tendency to sharpness and acidity which 
rather than condemning it identifies it 
wine writer kathryn mcwhirter says tactfully i think theyre 
quite interesting as a sort of rare occasion drink because theyre 
english and its interesting to drink wines from different places 
most have good fruit flavor she said but they tend to be 
rather thin 
english vineyards are concentrated among the farms and fruit 
orchards of the southeast but grapes grow as far west as truro in 
cornwall and one even claims to be the worlds most northerly 
commercial vineyard 
the romans planted the first english grapes about 2000 years 
ago and the domesday book records nearly 50 vineyards in southern 
england in 1086 
king henry viii wiped out the industry when he closed the last 
roman catholic monastery in 1526 at a time when the map of the 
monasteries mirrored the map of the vineyards 
a renaissance began after world war ii when scientistcumamateur 
gardener ray barrington brock set out as a hobby to discover which 
grapes would grow best in southern england 
for years winemaking remained a hobby and tax writeoff and most 
vintners need another source of income to survive 
david westphal of penshurst vineyards in kent relies on tourism 
and his apple orchard and in honor of his fathers australian 
roots raises rare sheep and small kangaroos called wallabies a 
wallaby is hidden in every label on his wine bottles 
westphal says one of his biggest problems is getting the english 
to try english wine the english are very conservative they dont 
like to try quite often you get the response ooohhh thats 
nice you know as if you were going to give them arsenic 
only 1350 acres of land is devoted to english vineyards which 
bond admits is infinitesimally small compared with germany or 
california 
at full production and with better weather output could 
increase tenfold bond said recent summers have been particularly 
wet and gales ruined much of the 1987 crop 
english winegrowers favor hardy german grapes particularly 
mueller thurgau a cross between the riesling and sylvaner vines 
its germanys most widely grown grape and accounts for 30 percent 
of all grapes planted in england bond said 
there just isnt enough sun to ripen red grapes for a fullbodied 
wine he said although a handful of brave souls continue to 
experiment 
most english wine is sold directly from the winery or to local 
hotels and restaurants very little is exported and its difficult 
to find in london stores 
however carr taylor vineyards near hastings in the southeast 
sells its sparkling wine to french hotels and eateries including 
the secondstage restaurant at the eiffel tower and supplies its 
1987 schonburger a still white wine on some british airways routes 
to canada 
elmham park winery in norfolk more than 100 miles northeast of 
london claims to be the worlds most northerly commercial vineyard 
and said it recently sold 200 cases of its blended 1986 dry white 
wine to a parisian wine merchant 
many english wines not to be confused with british wines which 
are made from imported concentrates are available in the 7 range 
to the consternation of winemakers as much as 175 of the 
bottle price is is excise tax four times the average of the 
12nation european economic community to which britain belongs

particularly ahead of thursdays report on average earnings and 
fridays retail price index dealers said

japanese scientists have begun developing a tiny 
robot to move inside the human body to treat diseased tissue a 
professor said wednesday 
the scientists eventually hope to produce a robot that can 
transmit its location and findings and can cut or otherwise treat 
diseased parts said iwao fujimasa of tokyo universitys research 
center for advanced science and technology 
researchers for many years have sent probes to study the oceans 
and outer space we hope to be able to study the inner world 
fujimasa said 
fujimasa an artificial heart specialist said the goal is a 
robot less than 004 inches in size that will be able to travel 
through veins and inside organs 
the project will require that the smallest currently available 
parts such as motors gears and screws be reduced to about 
onethousandth their present size he said 
even with a robot that size the team will need to study how to 
minimize problems created by its presence in the body such as 
blocking blood flow fujimasa said 
the group includes scientists from schools such as tokyo 
university and tokyo institute of technology and from companies 
such as toyota hitachi and sumitomo electric industries he said 
fujimasa said japans high level of semiconductor manufacturing 
technology which is capable of producing components less than 1 
micron in size would aid the project 
since september the group has received financial support from 
the ministry of international trade and industry fujimasa said it 
hopes the ministry will agree to fund a 80 million international 
micromachine center and provide annual funding of 16 million he 
said

a jury has decided wells fargo bank 
overcharged its credit card customers 52 million in fees for 
making payments late and exceeding credit limits 
the superior court verdict tuesday in the first of several 
similar suits against major banks entitles holders of mastercard 
and visa cards from wells fargo between july 1982 and may 1987 to 
41 million in refunds for latepayment fees and more than 1 
million for overlimit fees 
the jury agreed with lawyers for a group of bank customers that 
wells fargo failed to make a reasonable attempt to set its fees no 
higher than its costs but jurors awarded less than half the 11 
million the plaintiffs sought 
lawyers for the customers said wells fargo charged between 3 and 
5 for paying bills late while spending only 189 to process each 
late payment the lawyers said the bank charged 10 for exceeding 
credit limits but spent only 1 to 2 for each excessive charge 
we claimed you cant impose one of these charges above costs 
as a penalty to get someone to comply with a contract thats 
illegal said s chandler visher a lawyer for the customers 
other banks have been doing the same thing he said each 
case will be evaluated separately but with this win other banks 
are going to start to think that this can happen to them they may 
want to settle out of court 
visher who also represents customers in several other bank 
suits said similar suits are pending against crocker national bank 
security pacific bank barclays bank eureka savings and loan and 
first interstate bank the wells fargo case was the first to go to 
trial 
weyman lundquist a lawyer for wells fargo said he and the bank 
were not unhappy with the amount of the verdict but planned to 
appeal 
wells fargo believes its fees accurately reflect the total cost 
including indirect administrative costs of handling late payments 
and excessive charges lundquist said 
superior court judge robert dossee is to hear arguments next week 
on whether he should order wells fargo to reduce its fees

company ic industries from 197177 and as vice chairman of ic 
industries in 197778

half of us oil supplies energy analysts said wednesday 
the american petroleum institute which represents major oil 
producers and refiners said us crude oil production fell to 79 
million barrels a day a 34 percent drop from january 1988 
alaskan production which in recent years offset declines in 
other parts of the united states slipped for the second straight 
month with no major new oil fields tapped the washington 
dcbased group said in its monthly report about a quarter of us 
oil comes from alaska 
imports of oil and oil products surged to a rate of 82 million 
barrels a day an increase of 206 percent over the january 1988 
level of 68 million barrels it was the first month that imports 
averaged more than 8 million barrels since 1980 the api said 
last year imports jumped to the highest level since 1979 and 
domestic production hit a 12year low according to an earlier api 
report 
of the 183 million barrels of oil consumed daily in the united 
states 45 percent is from foreign sources and experts say that 
number will soon exceed 50 percent 
about 15 percent of us imports are from persian gulf countries 
larger percentages come from latin america including venezuela and 
mexico and from the north sea 
we better do something to ensure that this dependency doesnt 
cause us economic and security problems said john sawhill former 
deputy energy secretary and now a director of the mckinsey amp co 
inc management consultant firm 
were putting ourselves in a situation where were gradually 
going to become more dependent and at some point opec is going to be 
in a position to curtail our supplies 
weak oil prices have curtailed incentives to find and develop new 
oil in the united states furthermore because imports are cheaper 
experts predict they will continue increasing 
proven or recoverable us reserves are about 265 billion 
barrels or 3 percent of total world reserves said john redpatch 
an oil analyst with security analysis inc in washington 
that compared with 170 billion barrels or 19 percent of proven 
reserves held by saudi arabia he said 
out of all the oil left in the world today to be produced and 
exploitedabout twothirds is in the middle east he said so 
sooner or later if we continue consuming oil the way we do now we 
are going to become dependent on middle east supplies sometime in 
the next century 
a commerce department study released tuesday said that although 
growing us reliance on foreign oil is a longrange threat to 
national security it has not jeopardized the pentagons ability to 
fight a major nonnuclear war so no government action is needed to 
restrict oil imports 
however proposals are expected in congress for an oil import fee 
aimed at curbing the trend toward growing imports and shrinking 
domestic output 
the institutes latest report also said demand for oil and oil 
products surged last month with deliveries up more than 6 percent 
from the previous year for the third consecutive month 
approximately 183 million barrels a day of petroleum products were 
supplied in january compared with 172 million barrels in january a 
year ago 
despite the increase in imports inventories fell 13 million 
barrels or 23 percent with part of the decline the result of 
higher refinery activity refinery utilization rose from a rate of 
828 percent to 854 percent the highest monthly level since 1979 
gasoline deliveries jumped last month by 58 percent to a rate of 
7 million barrels per day compared with 668 million barrels in 
january 1988 
home heating oil and diesel fuel in the distillate category 
rose 47 percent last month while kerosene jet fuel rose 33 
percent and residual oil was up 93 percent compared with the 
previous january

the federal home loan mortgage corp which 
buys mortgages and packages them into securities for investors said 
wednesday its earnings rose 26 percent in the fourth quarter of 1988 
net income for the octoberdecember quarter totaled 97 million 
up from 77 million in the final quarter of 1987 
for all of last year earnings totaled 381 million or 573 per 
share up from 301 million in 1987 or 453 per share 
david glenn freddie mac executive vice president attributed the 
gain to a decline in corporate income tax rates 
also an increase in shortterm interest rates enabled the 
corporation to increase its float benefit or the income earned 
on money collected from mortgage payers before it is passed to 
investors holding freddie mac securities 
glenn said the income gains triggered by those factors were 
partly offset by a drop in fee income caused by increased 
competition and less mortgage origination activity

we had quite a wild day said john mccarthy chief dealer at 
amsterdam rotterdam bank the violence in the movements were as 
much generated by technical factors as by bearish sentiment 
dealers also described the dollars selloff as an expected 
correction after the strong advance it made earlier this year 
they said the dollar has dipped over the past week because of 
skepticism about the ability of the bush administration to cut the 
budget deficit and uncertainty about whether the federal reserve 
intends to raise interest rates to combat inflation

northrop corp lost 861 million in the 
fourth quarter of 1988 because of provisions for an expected 150 
million loss associated with a secret military project the 
aerospace company said wednesday 
company officials declined to identify the nature of the research 
and development project but said it did not involve the b2 stealth 
bomber it built for the air force 
the quarterly loss compared with a profit of 349 million or 74 
cents a share recorded in the same period last year 
fourthquarter sales also dropped by 2 percent to 173 billion 
compared with 177 billion during the same 1987 quarter 
the 150 million fourthquarter charge resulted from the 
companys conclusion that it will probably sustain a loss on certain 
classified longterm fixedprice research and development 
contracts northrop said in a statement 
the company said it was negotiating with the pentagon to make up 
some of the unanticipated costs on the project a company spokesman 
refused to elaborate 
for the full year northrop reported earnings of 1042 million 
or 222 a share an 11 percent increase over 942 million or 
201 per share in 1987 
northrop officials said the annual increase was made possible by 
tax breaks related to the fourthquarter loss because of the loss 
the company got a tax benefit of 427 percent in 1988 in contrast 
to its tax rate of 314 percent the year before 
the sales decline which was 4 percent for the full year was 
largely the result of reduced research and development on several 
classified projects and fewer deliveries of fuselages for the navys 
fa18 hornet fighter 
northrop makes the fuselage for the prime contractor mcdonnell

energy futures prices broke through an important price barrier 
and posted significant gains wednesday after reports that nonopec 
oil producers have proposed limiting their output of crude oil by 
300000 barrels a day as well as rumors of contaminated oil stocks 
in louisiana 
on other markets soybeans added modestly to tuesdays strong 
gains platinum surged despite a continuing gold slump and cattle 
and pork futures were off slightly in advance of a government report 
that traders fear could show too many animals are already at feed 
lots 
crude oil futures settled 83 cents higher in the spot month of 
march with the contract for delivery reaching 1825 a barrel 
gains ranging from 29 cents to 66 cents were registered in the back 
months at the new york mercantile exchange 
the crude oil market started off going nowhere but once it 
heard an offer was on the table for that kind of a cut it pushed 
through a lot of resistance at 1785 level said peter beutel of 
elders futures inc 
a report originating in london said a number of nonopec 
producers ranging from mexico to the soviet union have indicated a 
willingness to cut their combined production before a meeting with 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries set for 
london sometime next month 
then the market stalled again at 18 said beutel and we 
got a second boost from rumors of contaminated stocks in louisiana 
no one pinned it down he added but in the absence of being 
clear we saw some very good buying 
louisiana state officials said there was no contamination of 
stocks the rumors most likely were sparked by state environmental 
officials plans to adopt emergency rules for storage and handling 
of oil field pipe that has been contaminated after use in 
radioactive soil 
the runup in crude oil helped heating stocks climb 129 cents to 
164 cents higher with march at 4874 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline rose 45 cent to 144 cents with march at 4877 cents a 
gallon 
soybeans meanwhile got most of their support from the nearby 
soybean oil pit at the chicago board of trade traders said export 
business for the oils and fears of supply tightness because of a 
decline in malaysian stocks helped firm up prices in both pits 
weather however was again the markets dominant motivating 
factor and it was bearish on two counts traders said the rain and 
snow in the midwest would replenish soil moisture for the resumption 
next month of spring planting and steady rain in south america is 
expected to help developing crops there 
that dampened bean prices as well as prices for the grains 
wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in march at 425 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cents 
higher with march at 271 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cent 
lower with march at 208 a bushel and soybeans were 3 cents 
higher to 5 cents higher with march at 738 a bushel 
gold plummeted to a new low for the year in early trading at the 
comex but recouped most of its losses for the day settling 80 
cents to 1 lower with february at 38460 a troy ounce 
silver registered rises of 58 cents to 67 cents with february 
at 589 a troy ounce but platinum was the best performer among the 
precious metals wednesday climbing 590 across the board with 
february at 53620 a troy ounce 
platinum has been improving steadily since dropping sharply in 
recent months following a ford motor co announcement that it had 
developed a substitute for the metal in catalytic converter used in 
automobiles 
livestock and pork futures were mostly lower at the chicago 
mercantile as traders braced for the release thursday of the usdas 
cattleonfeed report 
theres some apprehension the report will show plenty of cattle 
on the feed lots said charlie richardson of lindwaldock inc 
denver cattles been the strength of the whole meat complex 
recently and with those marking time there wasnt much reason to 
walk in and buy hogs 
live cattle settled 50 cent lower to 18 cent higher with 
february at 7452 cents a pound feeder cattle were 43 cent lower 
to 02 cent higher with march at 8182 cents a pound live hogs 
were 38 cent lower to 02 cent higher with february at 4182 cents 
a pound and frozen pork bellies were unchanged to a limitdown 2 
cents with february at 3782 cents a pound

american industry is using more of its capacity 
than at any other time in nearly a decade the government said 
wednesday in a report that showed operating rates approaching levels 
that can worsen inflation 
the stock and bond markets were not alarmed by the report bond 
prices rose modestly and the dow jones average of 30 industrial 
stocks climbed 2268 to 230393 the dollar fell sharply but later 
made back most of its losses 
the federal reserve board said januarys operating rate of 844 
percent of capacity was unchanged from december for which the 
figure was revised upward from an earlier estimate of 842 percent 
the operating rate for january and december has not been 
surpassed since october 1979 when factories were functioning at 
846 percent of capacity 
historically capacity utilization rates of around 85 percent 
are the flashpoints for a speedup in inflation said robert 
defina senior economist for security pacific national bank in los 
angeles there are signs that things are getting tight that 
inflation pressures are building 
in a related report wednesday the fed reported that its 
industrial production index in january climbed 03 percent following 
a revised increase of 05 percent in december januarys increase 
was paced by a 05 percent rise in manufacturing production 
the feds industrial production index now stands at 1411 percent 
of its 1977 base 5 percent higher than a year earlier 
economist michael k evans head of a washington consulting firm 
said the reports show theres no sign of a slowdown in the 
economy despite the federal reserves efforts to restrain economic 
growth and keep inflation in check by pushing up interest rates 
evans said the portents are right for the fed to push rates 
even higher partly as a backlash against president bushs comments 
this week that he would not like to see the fed tighten credit 
further 
but richard rahn chief economist for the us chamber of 
commerce said that reports indicate industrial expansion was 
unnecessarily restrained by the feds tightening 
further hiking of the rates will restrict investment in 
capacity equipment even more and hold down further growth in 
capacity rahn said 
as use of industrial capacity rises so does concern that 
factories will have trouble keeping up with orders leading to 
shortages and price increases 
januarys report showed operating rates at manufacturing plants 
up 02 percentage point to 848 percent while activity at mines and 
utilities decreased 
capacity utilization for durable goods big ticket items 
expected to last more than three years rose 01 percentage point 
to 833 percent while the rate for nondurable goods increased 03 
percentage points to 869 percent 
even higher operating rates existed in several industries 
including primary metals at 916 percent of capacity petroleum 
products 891 percent chemicals 892 percent and paper products 
946 percent 
automobile plants meanwhile slipped to 757 percent of 
capacity down from 798 percent in the previous month the 
production report showed autos were assembled at an annual rate of 
75 million units down from 79 million in december 
economist cynthia latta of data resources inc in lexington 
mass said that while the reports didnt indicate growth has been 
so strong the economy will overheat the capacity utilization 
figures also dont suggest that we can stop worrying about 
inflation 
defina said the message was that the economy remained healthy 
as it entered the new year it indicates that the things the fed is 
worrying about inflation pressures are still there 
consumer prices rose 44 percent last year identical to the 1987 
gain the first look at consumer prices in the new year will come 
with the release of januarys report on feb 22 
wholesale prices in january shot up at their fastest pace in 
nearly three years the labor department said last week 
a third economic report released wednesday showed that business 
inventories rose 09 percent in december while sales jumped 08 
percent leaving the ratio of inventories to sales unchanged at 150 
that means it would take 15 months to exhaust inventories at the 
december sales pace reported by the commerce department 
if not accompanied by rising sales increasing inventories can 
signal economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to 
order production cuts and layoffs while reserve goods are sold off 
ms latta said it was a positive development that inventories 
remained under control because companies wont be left holding big 
surpluses in the event of an economic downturn 
if inventories are lean then the effect of a slowdown is 
cushioned she said 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots in december rose to a seasonally adjusted 7606 billion 
while sales reached 5082 billion

crude oil futures surged wednesday fueled by a 
report that nonopec producers may cut production 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude rose 83 cents 
to 1825 a barrel breaking through what analysts said was a 
crucial technical barrier at 18 the contract closed at 1742 on 
tuesday other contract months also rose 
the jump in crude prices helped pull up refined product prices 
traders said unleaded gasoline scheduled for release next month 
rose 144 cents to close the day at 4877 cents a gallon while 
heating oil increased 136 cents to 4874 cents a gallon contracts 
for delivery after march also rose 
traders said the market opened higher but slid early despite a 
weekly american petroleum institute report showing that crude oil 
stocks fell 76 million barrels a day last week the report proved 
neutral for the market because it offset the previous weeks 
statistics that showed a 7 million barrel rise in crude inventories 
about midday a report quoting a representative of a nonopec 
observer nation rallied the market said nauman barakat vice 
president of energy investments at prudentialbache securities inc 
the report said a group of producers outside the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries is considering a 300000 barreladay 
cut in output 
the report indicated its a deal already done barakat said 
he said such an agreement would be formalized at a meeting next week 
the nonopec group is scheduled to meet in london on monday and 
tuesday a similar meeting last month adjourned without producing an 
accord but the group issued a statement saying it supported recent 
cutbacks by opec 
wednesdays energy prices also got a lift from a report that 
louisiana oil field pipes are contaminated said andrew lebow 
senior broker and analyst with edampf man international futures inc 
louisiana state officials said there was no contamination of 
stocks the rumors most likely were sparked by state environmental 
officials plans to adopt emergency rules for storage and handling 
of oil field pipe that has been contaminated after use in 
radioactive soil 
the states department of environmental quality is enacting 
emergency rules next week for the pipes until formal rules can be 
adopted in about 120 days 
lebow said the report was bullish because it led to concerns 
about possible production cutbacks

the militant machinists union announced overwhelming 
support wednesday for a strike against eastern airlines next month 
unless a contract is signed while the carrier charged that an 
illegal work slowdown has backed up 19 aircraft and delayed flights 
in other developments the union contended that eastern 
management has brought recruitment of possible strikebreakers to its 
home turf 
charles bryan machinists district president told members at a 
packed union hall meeting that 9733 percent of the voting 
membership authorized a strike if no contract is reached 
the final ballots were cast tuesday in atlanta the count was 
completed late wednesday afternoon and participation was 77 
percent bryan said 
after announcing the vote the union leader charged that eastern 
has been stalling talks 
they have not moved in 16 months in their original opening 
position bryan said they are not negotiating this strike vote 
simply means that if they continue in that mode and do not 
negotiate there will be a strike on march 4 
eastern responded that the strike authorization vote was easily 
predicted and that the carrier has been focusing all efforts on a 
negotiated settlement 
meanwhile eastern attorney david ross charged that a very 
serious slowdown and a sickout by union workers have caused a 
backlog of aircraft that cannot fly until they pass mandated checks 
but bryan called the charge a smokescreen 
the work is being done he said 
members of the machinists union representing around 8500 
mechanics and ground workers at eastern have been working without a 
contract for 13 months if there is still no solution by late next 
week federal mediators plan to bring both sides together in 
washington 
if there is still no contract by midnight est march 3 eastern 
will be able to impose its own work rules and the machinists will 
be able to strike legally 
ross charged that the machinists have caused the 19aircraft 
backup by taking twice the normal time to perform what he called c 
and d checks anything from routine mechanical inspections to major 
overhauls 
historically we have had no backup we always have planes in 
ccheck or dcheck status but we dont have 19 planes waiting to be 
worked on he said we would normally only have a certain number 
in being done and then put back in service 
but bryan claimed that easterns recent performance refutes the 
carriers allegation of widespread work slowdowns 
it is mindboggling that the main line of eastern advertising 
right now currently is theyre the no1 ontime operator in the 
entire airline industry the union leader said how could that 
possibly be going on if our people are slowing down we must perform 
and perform quickly and do a good job for that to happen 
meanwhile both sides pressed their arguments in federal court 
wednesday with the union trying to keep the carrier from farming 
out work traditionally done by organized labor eastern said it has 
no other choice 
the airline has begun to subcontract certain work that it has 
been unable to perform as needed due to circumstances beyond its 
control eastern said in an amended complaint filed late tuesday 
if the machinists are allowed to continue on the same course the 
union will continue to cause substantial and irreparable injury to 
eastern the traveling public and the free flow of interstate 
commerce the complaint alleged 
the airline also contended that slowdowns and sickouts have 
caused and will continue to cause substantial flight delays and 
disruptions during easterns normally heavy winter travel season 
us senior district judge c clyde atkins agreed to accept the 
machinists case on subcontracting and directed eastern to file a 
response by noon est thursday he said he will then set a hearing 
probably before the week is over 
the machinists asked us district judge james w kehoe on 
tuesday to send the case to a different judge but kehoe granted 
eastern motions wednesday to send the case to atkins who ordered 
an end to a wildcat strike by ground crews last week 
the union also charged that eastern has started recruiting 
strikebreakers in miami with newspaper ads offering airport 
opportunities for baggage handlers agents and managers but listing 
no employer similar ads ran in atlanta and in washington dc 
last week 
eastern based in miami is a subsidiary of houstonbased texas 
air corp

morgan stanley amp co said wednesday it has 
abandoned a voluntary restraint on a controversial form of 
computerized stock trading that was widely blamed for price 
volatility during and after the october 1987 crash 
the move by the venerable investment banking firm ended a 
ninemonth suspension on socalled index arbitrage program trading 
by morgan stanley for its own account 
morgan was one of several brokerages that restricted use of the 
technique for their own accounts in may because of a public outcry 
that index arbitrage program trading was injecting wild price swings 
into the stock market without regard to underlying values the firms 
continued to use it for customers 
bear stearns amp co another prominent indexarbitrage program 
trader that had limited use of the technique for its own account 
resumed it this past summer 
index arbitrage program trading refers to the use of big 
computers to instantly sell massive amounts of stock in new york and 
simultaneously buy the underlying stockindex futures in chicago or 
vice versa to profit from temporary price disparities between the 
two markets 
some studies of the oct 19 1987 the worst stock panic in 
history said index arbitrage program trading may have played a role 
in aggravating the crisis and contributing to the record 508point 
drop in the dow jones industrial average that day 
the joint industry solutions and the significant reduction in 
market volatility since oct 19 1987 have permitted an increase in 
confidence in the us equity market morgan said in a statement 
about its decision to resume index arbitrage program trading 
morgan also said it believes index arbitrage plays an important 
economic role in linking the futures and underlying stock markets 
last february the new york stock exchange banned the use of its 
computers for index arbitrage program trading on days when the dow 
average rose or fell 50 points from the previous days close 
that limitation dubbed the collar was scrapped last oct 
19 on the crash anniversary replaced by a broader set of reforms 
that included temporary trading halts if the dow average fell 250 
points or more in a day

caterpillar inc unveiled a new corporate 
trademark wednesday the second time in three years the 
imageconscious company has changed its public identity 
in 1986 caterpillar dropped tractor from its name and 
launched an aggressive effort to diversify the products and services 
it offers caterpillar is the worlds leading manufacturer of 
earthmoving equipment 
the new trademark is actually two different logos to be used 
interchangeably one features the word cat with a yellow 
triangle underneath the other uses the word caterpillar in 
block letters with a yellow triangle under the first three letters 
the triangle is a graphic device designed to evoke thoughts of 
stability strength and technology said john hanson the 
peoriabased companys vice president of marketing 
no one is naive enough to expect these changes alone will 
produce an immediate increase in sales or a renewed image said 
george schaefer chairman and chief executive officerbut giving 
the caterpillar trademarks a new look is another important step in 
company strategy if identifies caterpillar as a modern progressive 
company 
caterpillars current logo is an abstact blackandwhite c 
introduced in 1968 however it failed to increase the identify of 
caterpillar products and internal surveys showed poor recognition of 
the symbol when it was not accompanied by the company name company 
executives said 
schaefer said the change is designed to capitalize on the 
publics positive image of cat and caterpillar and provide 
some uniformity to the growing list of caterpillar subsidiaries and 
their logos 
hanson said the company estimates it will cost upwards of 10 
million over five years to convert all buildings vehicles 
equipment stationery packaging and other items to the new logo 
caterpillar is coming off perhaps the best year ever in the 
64year history of the company which employs 60558 people 
worldwide and consistently ranks among the top 50 us industrial 
corporations in sales 
caterpillar posted record sales of 104 billion and profits of 
616 million in 1988 
although earthmoving and construction equipment and engines 
remain the foundation of caterpillars success the company has 
broadened its operations to include turbine engines lift trucks 
high technology parts distribution financial services and 
insurance
