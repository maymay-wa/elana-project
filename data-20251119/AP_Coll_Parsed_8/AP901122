theres nothing fancy and not much 
modern at goolricks modern pharmacy where the druggist still 
delivers prescriptions and the soda fountain waitresses call 
everyone baby 
much of the store looks as it did 50 years ago say employees 
and patrons 
they got real wild in 1950 and changed the outside some why 
change something if it works asks former owner and druggist 
charlie rector 
the new owner is already looking to replace a new pepsi machine 
with something that looks older because the regulars dont like it 
at 225 an egg salad and bacon sandwich is the most expensive 
itemon the menu at the pharmacys lunch counter behind the 
counter cigarettes are stacked in wooden racks alongside tins of 
snuff and goodys headache powder 
we get lots of tourists in here who say look an 
oldfashioned drug store you dont see them like that anymore i 
say yeah and you know why because you wouldnt patronize them 
rector said 
the drugstore has been in business on the same downtown corner 
for 121 years through a fire floods desegregation and the rise 
of chain drug and convenience stores that put many independent 
pharmacies out of business 
rector bristles at the suggestion the store is an anachronism 
this is not a curiosity this is what a drugstore is supposed to 
look like 
when rector took over the business from his father and uncle in 
1953 he had four competitors within a twoblock radius when he 
retired and sold goolricks this fall it was the only drugstore in 
the business district in this city between washington and richmond 
like many american cities fredericksburgs merchant district 
hit hard times in the 1960s and 1970s but shopkeepers have been 
able to capitalize on local revolutionary and civil war sites and 
the citys proximity to washington 
now antique and gift shops thrive in buildings that once housed 
supermarkets and a fiveanddime tourists and antique buyers swarm 
the brick sidewalks on sunny weekends and fill up the stools at 
goolricks 
a group composed mostly of elderly city natives gathers weekday 
mornings each with an unofficial spot at the counter or at one of 
a halfdozen tables 
its not just a drugstore its a way of life rector said 
the store was founded in 1869 and remained in the goolrick 
family until rectors father bought the business in 1933 rector 
said 
as a boy rector chipped ice swept floors and delivered 
cocacolas and camels to downtown beauty shops on saturday 
mornings he said 
the drugstore has prepared prescriptions for generations of city 
residents and still delivers drugs at any hour a few people who 
got their first goolricks prescription before world war i are 
still customers rector said 
new owner stephen may has pledged not to make any major changes 
although he does plan to add a few tourist trinkets to the 
inventory 
i think everyone was worried i was going to rip the fountain 
out or worse yet fire all the help said may 39 a pharmacist 
who plans to keep the store until retirement 
regulars are touchy about even the smallest changes they 
dont like the new pepsi machine i put in here so im going to try 
to replace it with something that looks older may said 
people like it just the way it is i guess if you came in 
here as a child with your mother and now youve got kids of your 
own you want them to see it like you did said waitress viola

folks in and around vattman dont even 
consider eating thanksgiving dinner at home or going off to visit 
relatives for most of this century its been a day when they all 
sit down together 
the people here in this community this is their home for that 
day said the rev sean noone irishborn pastor of the small 
roman catholic church that rises out of vattmans plowed fields 
thanksgiving has been the high point of the year in the sparsely 
populated farming area since 1913 when the annual feast began in a 
grove of mesquite trees it was canceled only in 1943 due to food 
and fuel rationing in world war ii 
and 1943 is the only time that idella strubhart 71 has ever 
eaten thanksgiving dinner at home she grew up in riviera an 
unincorporated town of 500 or so eight miles west of vattman in 
southern texas southwest of corpus christi 
she said a daughter in san antonio invited her for thaksgiving 
this year and i told her i just couldnt do it everybody has a 
job to do here 
mrs strubhart was supposed to work in the kitchen while her 
husband fritz 78 helped run the bingo game they met at the 1932 
thanksgiving dance 
what began as a small gathering has evolved into a major 
production at the parish hall of our lady of consolation church 
about the only structure that identifies vattman as a community in 
southern kleberg county the handbook of texas describes vattman as 
more a community center for nearby farming families than a 
town 
the allday party merely begins with the dinner bingo target 
shooting ring toss and other games keep the picnic going until the 
dance starts at 8 pm 
this year the parish of about 60 families expects to feed 1500 
people at its thanksgiving day picnic some former residents travel 
hundreds of miles old friends and strangers also show up 
farm and residential development began in 1908 on land the king 
ranch sold after the railroad came through predominantly german 
settlers came to farm the land now nearly all of the residents of 
northern european descent seem to be related either by blood or 
marriage 
they and their hispanic neighbors keep a slow rural pace and a 
sense of community hard to find in modern urban america weddings 
and high school football provide about the only source of public 
entertainment the rest of the year 
we grew up in sort of a naive setting here said 62yearold 
native teddy marie wallace one of this years picnic organizers 
residents donate much time and effort she said because they 
know they have something worth preserving 
i think were kind of sinfully proud of our accomplishment 
she said im sorry but we are we do a good job 
the thanksgiving dinner priced at 7 for adults and 4 for 
children also is the churchs only fundraising event the picnic 
attracts members of other denominations as well as people who 
otherwise never set foot in a church 
this years plans called for parishioners to cook 56 turkeys at 
home and take them to the church on thanksgiving day 
others prepared vegetables and desserts loretta yaklin the 
mashed potato maven remembers how the nowdefunct vattman 
parochial school she attended used to put the students to work 
preparing the parish hall the week of thanksgiving 
the pastor said picnic organizers will meet about a week after 
thanksgiving and start planning for next year 
if we ever quit it there would be a lot of people lost 
mrs yaklin said what would we do

the treasury department is considering a 
deposit insurance change that could pinch small depositors even 
though it is aimed mainly at reducing coverage for the rich 
the department asked the federal deposit insurance corp for its 
opinion on whether to restrict each american to three federally 
insured bank savings institution or credit00peraccount insurance limit 
some use brokers to divide their money among a number of 
institutions others use a combination of single joint and trust 
accounts to protect more than 100000 under existing rules a 
couple with one child for instance can protect up to 12 million 
at a single bank 
seidman said treasurys idea has some merits and ought to be 
looked at but a trade group the independent bankers 
association of america is vigorously fighting it 
it argues that many americans of modest means maintain more than 
three accounts for instance a depositor with six accounts 
1000 in checking 5000 in savings 2000 in a credit union 
10000 in an ira retirement fund and two 1000 certificates of 
deposit would be allowed to designate only three of them as 
insured even though the total 20000 is far below the 
100000 limit 
i think tens of millions of people would be adversely affected 
and their financial life rendered more uncertain at just the wrong 
time said kenneth guenther executive vice president of the 
independent bankers group which represents smaller community 
banks 
a lot of cds certificates of deposit would wind up not being 
insured he said 
however seidman said most small depositors likely would 
consolidate their accounts so that all of their money was 
guaranteed 
this is much more likely to cut back on the guy who has quite 
a bit more money he said 
a senior treasury official speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said the definition of an account for insurance 
purposes could be changed so that savers could combine all of 
their certificates of deposit into one savings account with varying 
maturities 
the official stressed that limiting the number of accounts was 
one of a number of proposals floating around and we are not 
in any sense embracing it 
however guenthers group citing unidentified top policy 
officials said a limit on multiple accounts is the reform 
concept most alive and well in treasury circles 
the independent bankers have been lobbying against any cutback 
in deposit insurance they argue that large banks which regulators 
believe must be kept from failing to protect the financial system 
would have an advantage in attracting deposits over smaller 
institutions whose failure would not threaten the system 
but many economists have cited the broad coverage of deposit 
insurance as one of the causes of the savings and loan debacle 
shaky institutions have no trouble attracting deposits because the 
accounts are federally guaranteed they say 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said in july that the 
administration was considering ways to limit depositors to 100000 
coverage but a letter from guenther to members of his group was 
the first indication the administration is considering restrictions 
that could affect depositors with much less than 100000 
in an effort to kill the proposal the trade group on wednesday 
sent member banks 250000 protest postcards to be filled out by 
customers and mailed to president bush 
we hope by monday there will be 100000 postcards at the white 
house guenther said

big oil companies nearly doubled their profits 
from petroleum production after the middle east crisis erupted but 
most gains were offset by lower earnings from refining marketing 
and the chemical business a government report says 
the major oil companies net earnings rose only 17 percent in 
the third quarter despite soaring prices for crude oil and 
petroleum products the energy information administration said 
wednesday 
theres no statistical evidence that profiteering took 
place said calvin a kent administrator of the energy 
department agency although he said he could not rule out the 
possibility of some isolated cases of profiteering 
a study of thirdquarter earnings reports from the oil companies 
showed that the jump in oil prices after iraqs invasion of kuwait 
on aug 2 did not result in runaway profits for us companies 
kent said at a news conference 
some consumer groups that closely follow energy issues greeted 
the report with skepticism 
edwin rothschild an energy analyst for public citizen accused 
the energy department of protecting the oil companies and said 
congress should examine the companies financial reports 
independently 
he accused the companies of using all sorts of accounting 
schemes to underreport profits and he contended that 
especially in the weeks immediately after the mideast crisis began 
oil companies benefited significantly from inventory profits 
selling cheap oil bought before the crisis at the higher rates 
the report said most of the oil companies did not separately 
report inventory profit gains and losses in their julyseptember 
quarterly reports and that the issue would be examined further when 
annual reports become available early next year 
the report provided no figures for specific companies but it 
said that generally companies with their own production capability 
fared much better than those that had to buy most of their oil 
although overall profits for the major oil companies were given 
at only 17 percent the companies fared much better in their 
petroleum business the major companies reported that earnings 
directly from petroleum activities increased 24 percent during the 
three months 
but most of these gains were offset by a 50 percent decline in 
earnings from chemical subsidiaries that had higher costs partly 
because of soaring oil prices 
noting that 80 percent of the worlds oil production comes from 
foreign countries the report said the vast majority of the 
benefit of higher oil prices went to foreign interests primarily 
foreign governments 
but production profits increased sharply for the major us oil 
companies as well eight us oil companies which provided 
production profits separately reported earnings of nearly 15 
billion from production during the three months a 90 percent 
increase over the same period in 1989 
it was unclear from the report to what extent those profits were 
offset by losses in refining and marketing at specific companies 
refinery profits increased at five of the companies by as much as 
46 percent while at six other companies they declined by up to 83 
percent the report said 
meanwhile us independent oil and gas producers a relatively 
small segment of the industry took advantage of the soaring world 
oil prices and earned 102 million during the threemonth period a 
685 percent increase over the previous year these producers 
reported earnings of only 13 million in the third quarter of 1989 
iraqs invasion of kuwait led to a united nations embargo of 
iraqi and kuwaiti oil and a shortfall of world oil supplies by 43 
million barrels a day prompting prices to jump even though saudi 
arabia and several other nations quickly announced they would step 
up production 
spot crude oil prices which were about 21 a barrel before the 
invasion peaked at 41 a barrel in october before declining the 
price closed at about 30 wednesday

toys that could choke or strangle young 
children still are on store shelves this christmas shopping season 
a consumer group says 
releasing a list of allegedly hazardous toys that its members 
found in stores throughout the country the us public interest 
research group said safety standards are too lax and inadequately 
enforced 
as the biggest shopping day of the year approaches parents 
should not assume that the toys they find on the shelves are 
safe lucinda sikes attorney for us pirg said at a news 
conference wednesday 
because of inadequate or misleading labeling toys containing 
small parts that fit easily into a small childs mouth are still 
available to children under 3 despite regulations designed to 
protect that age group the consumer group contended 
the federal consumer product safety commission sets the labeling 
standard saying that toys with small parts should be labeled as 
not intended for use by children under 3 
but in a report trouble in toyland us pirg said the 
labeling even when accurately reflecting the intended age group 
misleads parents by ignoring the safety rationale the labeling 
often is in very small type as well it said 
many parents may regard age labeling as a suggestion based on 
the developmental maturity of a child not realizing that the toys 
labeled for use by children over 3 are often potentially lethal for 
children who still tend to put things in their mouths sikes 
said 
as examples the consumer group displayed parts that were either 
loose as in puzzles or could easily be broken off or pulled off 
such as wheels or other pieces of toy cars 
the report pointed to some crib gyms as particularly hazardous 
and said balloons can be lifethreatening as well the group 
basing its report on 21 toys it said researchers had found on sale 
in 14 states said industry standards for such products are being 
skirted or violated 
david a miller president of the new yorkbased toy 
manufacturers of america accused the consumer group of trying to 
frighten parents about toys that are perfectly safe 
he accused the group of trying to become national nannies 
and said it ignored the role of parental supervision and common 
sense 
glenn bozarth of mattell inc said the group speculated 
that a piece could break off the mickeytown ice cream playset 
despite thorough testing by the company showing the toy doesnt 
break 
he said the consumer group should have approached mattell about 
the complaint instead of going directly to the media 
shari metzler of gund inc in edison nj said the group 
included on the list a toy siamese cat that the company quit 
selling two years ago 
allan shook of trisar inc of anaheim calif said the group 
used an old package of balloons sold by the company he said the 
company changed its warning label in july to reflect that children 
as old as 5 face choking hazards from balloons and will include 
even stricter labeling next year 
sikes acknowledged that the product safety commission was 
working on special labeling requirements for balloons balls and 
marbles but she said the rulemaking could take years 
she said she was encouraged however by a new law that gives 
the commission authority to fine manufacturers who keep putting 
unsafe products on the market 
cpsc spokesman dan rumelt said the agency had not had time to 
review the consumer groups list the agency held its own 
presentation earlier this week urging parents and shoppers to 
watch for similar hazards 
the commission said it received reports of 33 deaths related to 
toys from january 1989 to september 1990 in 20 of these cases the 
children choked on small objects 
the consumer group said toyrelated injuries have increased 
steadily rising to 148000 in 1989

some of the american hostages who are 
spending a quiet but somber thanksgiving in the iraqi capital say 
it could be worse they could be among the human shields held 
at potential military targets 
although we have it better than those at the sites we all 
suffer the indignity of being a hostage said roland bergheer 
among a handful of american men who planned a turkey dinner today 
at the us embassy residence 
about 100 americans are among the 600 westerners held at 
strategic iraqi installations to deter a feared us attack 
everyone at the residence feels this is the greatest holiday 
of the year the most meaningful but it will be somber and 
quiet said bergheer 62 a construction company executive who 
grew up in los angeles and makes his home in las vegas 
joe wilson the charge daffaires at the american embassy said 
he hoped to begin thanksgiving with the latest of several protests 
to the iraqi foreign ministry about the plight of americans 
prevented from leaving iraq 
it is an issue that wilson has raised at least twice a week with 
officials at all levels and with president saddam hussein during 
their only meeting on aug 6 four days after iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
he said special appeals have been made for hostages with medical 
problems and individuals who should be evacuated for humanitarian 
reasons wilson said 75 people fall into those categories 
the iraqis have mostly ignored the appeals even for one man 
whose wife died while he was being held at a strategic site 
i tell you it is terribly frustrating wilson said i 
dont even know if my condolence letter to the gentleman has 
reached him 
he said the iraqi response has been that the hostages are 
guests who will be released when iraq receives assurances it 
will not be attacked 
diplomats are not allowed to visit hostages at strategic sites 
the embassy tries to send the hostages their mail through the 
foreign ministry the diplomats have set up a pen pal system in 
hopes of sending those hostages more regular mail they publish a 
weekly newsletter with football scores and news items designed not 
to attract the attention of an iraqi censor 
we try to give them something that will remind them of home 
and let them know we are thinking about them wilson said 
over the months of captivity the hostages in baghdad have 
developed close relationships among themselves and with the 
diplomats 
they the hostages are really tough people wilson said 
theyre good people they understand the issues and know how big 
the issues are they want to be able to walk out of here with 
their heads high and not as a result of some underhanded 
negotiations or payoff 
the american hostages in iraq on wednesday addressed a 
thanksgiving message to those celebrating the national holiday in 
the united states the message said in part 
the ingredients of this deeply meaningful dinner are very 
special and are not available everywhere the two main ingredients 
are freedom and justice for all freedom to be your very best to 
exceed your own expectations to worship and follow your own god 
and to come and go as you please justice to guarantee your rights 
and freedoms under our constitution until proven wrong

information that helped china develop a 
neutron bomb was stolen from lawrence livermore national laboratory 
through espionage according to a published report 
a lab official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told the 
san jose mercury news that espionage sometime before 1987 gave the 
chinese information they needed to explode a neutron bomb on sept 
29 1988 
the official said the information leak was a result of total 
complete lack of management oversight 
details of how the information was passed remain classified 
george carver a former deputy director of the cia said 
publicly last month that the chinese success was based on us 
nuclear research the newspaper reported wednesday 
in 1988 the chinese blossomed forth with the neutron bomb 
which was made from data stolen from us research centers he 
said in a speech to lawrence livermore employees 
thats what a number of people think including my friends in 
the bureau fbi carter said in a telephone interview from his 
office at the center for strategic and international studies in 
washington dc 
ed appel the head of counterintelligence in the fbis san 
francisco office confirmed the bureau has investigated possible 
espionage at the lab no arrests have been made 
you could make the logical assumption that there have been 
successful espionage attempts against the lab since its 
inception appel said 
the general accounting office reported in 1988 that foreign 
intelligence agents posing as visiting scientists had gained access 
to lawrence livermore and americas other two nuclear weapons 
design laboratories 
the gao said dozens of chinese had visited lawrence livermore 
without a required background check and some were later found to 
have links to chinese intelligence services 
the chinese likely lacked information on how to build parts for 
a neutron bomb said john lewis a chinese affairs expert at 
stanford university 
its not a very difficult theoretical technology its an 
engineering problem said lewis who has written a book on the 
chinese nuclear weapons program 
a neutron bomb is a weapon designed to kill with lethal doses of 
radiation without the widespread damage caused by other nuclear 
weapons

the state department contends it is 
extremely risky for americans to visit hostage relatives in 
iraq but a member of a family delegation in baghdad insists he and 
others were bring treated almost like royalty 
in issuing the warning wednesday department spokesman richard 
boucher cited a close call tuesday involving james stevenson an 
american hostage in iraq two of his brothers and a sister 
according to bouchers account when the two brothers went to 
the mansour melia hotel in baghdad security officials there tried 
to move them to the 10th floor where the detainees are held 
a us consular official who was at the hotel trying to find 
americans intervened she notified the embassy which protested 
the incident the two americans were released 
had the consular officer not been there who knows what the 
fate of this family might have been boucher said its 
incidents like these that force us to remind americans that travel 
to iraq is extremely risky 
for those who have decided to travel we request that they 
inform the state department of their plans so we can alert our 
embassy in baghdad and offer assistance as needed and as 
possible 
but stevensons sister mary trundy reported that the group has 
not experienced any danger 
they are being treated almost like royalty said her husband 
dennis who spoke to mrs trundy on wednesday afternoon from 
brockton mass 
boston television station whdh quoted mrs trundy as saying 
we were not detained they have treated us like a guest 
trundy said his wife made no mention of tuesdays incident and 
he had nothing on the conditions of her brothers confinement she 
planned to have thanksgiving dinner with her brother today he 
said 
trundy acknowledged he was concerned about the visit because of 
uncertainty as to what the iraqis might do 
i left the decision up to her i didnt want to sway her one 
way or the other i knew she was going he said 
boucher said four families have visited relatives in iraq and 
four others have indicated an intention to visit

a federal judge plans a dec 4 hearing on a 
lawsuit by 45 house democrats seeking to bar president bush from 
ordering an attack on iraq without congressional approval 
us district judge harold h greene on wednesday gave the 
government until monday to file its response to the lawsuit the 
judge said he would hear arguments dec 4 on the lawmakers motion 
for a preliminary injunction in the case 
the lawmakers led by rep ronald v dellums dcalif contend 
in the lawsuit filed tuesday that under the constitutions war 
powers clause congress must debate and vote on a declaration of war 
before american troops can be used to dislodge iraqi forces from 
kuwait 
were talking about a really serious situation an emergency 
hearing on dec 4 to really determine whether the president can use 
the offensive option said michael ratner an attorney for the 
center for constitutional rights which represents the lawmakers 
greene a liberal democrat appointed by president carter 
rejected the justice departments motion to transfer the case to 
us district judge royce c lamberth a former government attorney 
appointed by reagan lamberth is considering a separate challenge 
to the presidents warmaking powers by sgt michael r ange 
ange a recently activated army national guard reservist is 
seeking a court order that he be returned to this country 
ange lost a bid for a temporary restraining order to bar his 
deployment to the middle east but lamberth scheduled a dec 10 
hearing on his motion for a permanent injunction saying the case 
poses a difficult legal question 
in rejecting the justice departments transfer motion greene 
said the only two factors which the two actions have in common 
are some of the department of justices apparent defenses and the 
fact that there is an overlap among counsel 
the new york citybased center for constitutional rights 
represents both ange and the lawmakers the same section of the 
justice departments civil division is handling both cases

moments before he was sentenced to 10 years in 
prison convicted wall street financier michael milken sat in his 
chair crying 
when us district judge kimba wood pronounced the sentence 
wednesday milken stood quietly it was the stiffest penalty 
delivered in cases arising from wall street insidertrading 
scandals 
milkens distress was evident from the moment he walked into the 
standingroomonly courtroom with his wife lori on his arm 
he seemed tense as he alternately fidgeted in his seat at the 
defense table or sat with his hands clenched in his lap 
about 10 minutes into the hearing milken started sobbing as his 
lawyer arthur liman read a letter from a woman who wrote of 
milkens help for her braindamaged daughter 
this is a man whose concerns about his friends or people in 
trouble always came first liman said 
milkens outburst lasted a few minutes although he appeared to 
cry or be close to tears at several other points of limans nearly 
hourlong presentation 
mrs milken sat in the front row with family members and friends 
and blinked back tears as liman described milken as an 
extraordinary husband and father 
milken spoke briefly 
i did not only violate the law but all of my values and 
principles i deeply regret it and will for the rest of my life 
im truly sorry he said before slumping back in his seat 
after the judge left the bench mrs milken rushed to her 
husbands side and hugged him she then grabbed him by the arm and 
led him from the courtroom through a rear door

friends of michael milken viewed the 
convicted financiers 10year prison sentence for securities and 
tax fraud as unduly harsh compared to penalties imposed on other 
wall street miscreants 
they said they had hoped the former drexel burnham lambert 
executive would be required only to perform community service 
now they are hoping that after milken cooperates with 
investigators as he has indicated he will do his sentence will be 
reduced 
its like they hit me over the head with a sledgehammer what 
a waste talent said richard riordan a prominent lawyer and 
philanthropist who has been an ally of milken in many business and 
charitable activities 
riordan noted that us district judge kimba wood who sentenced 
milken in manhattan said she would consider reducing his 
punishment if he cooperates with investigators 
and mike will cooperate riordan said hell tell the 
truth 
riordan said he and milken spent much of sunday discussing 
charitable projects on which they have worked around the country 
many for inner city children 
melba f coleman a beneficiary of one of those projects said 
she too was devastated by the news of the 10year sentence 
milken had seemed hopeful earlier in the week that he might get 
only community service she said 
i am just devastated i talked with him on monday his spirits 
were up said mrs coleman the principal of the 102nd street 
school in watts 
milken had set up a math club for children at the school showed 
up to tutor them himself once brought along pop star michael 
jackson and gave the children tshirts calculators and circus 
tickets 
that personal involvement in the heavily minority area had won 
him the loyalty of mrs coleman and others who wore i love 
michael milken buttons 
i was optimistic he would get community service mrs 
coleman said and he was optimistic too he told me i hope to 
see you in a few weeks 
in arguing that milkens sentence was too severe riordan 
pointed to ivan boesky the speculator in takeover stocks whose 
confessions to insider trading led investigators to milken in 1986 
boesky who served two years of a threeyear term committed 
more serious crimes but mike was king of the mountain and they 
used boesky to get mike riordan said 
he said that while milken broke laws his actions were not 
evil whereas boesky took inside information he bribed 
people and he used it to make money 
milkens charitable contributions particularly to minorities 
are well known and were the topic of a host of promilken letters 
written to wood before he was sentenced 
los angeles superior court judge richard a adler for example 
wrote an unsolicited letter to wood on milkens behalf adler 
whose son received math lessons from milken noted the philanthropy 
began years before milken was in trouble with the law

the army has decided to halt retirements and 
discharges as well as transfers unrelated to the persian gulf 
crisis according to news reports 
the washington post said in todays editions that the army had 
decided to use the authority to hold personnel in the service 
which was granted by defense secretary dick cheney under a 
littlenoticed presidential order issued in august 
normally 5 percent to 7 percent of the 760000 soldiers in the 
army would leave each month 
the post said details of the plans were being worked out and 
that some exemptions would be given for hardship cases such as 
family illness the plan could keep in place most of the army 
personnel who may be seeking to return to the united states from 
overseas bases or move from one base to another the paper said 
the post quoted unnamed officials as interpreting the decision 
as move to keep officers and enlisted personnel with specific 
skills in place implying that it might not be applied 
acrosstheboard 
the new york times quoted officials as saying the army has 
decided to use the authority to halt about 1500 retirements and 
discharges a month but that no decision had been made by the navy 
air force or marine corps 
the times quoted navy officials as saying they were considering 
using the authority to retain dentists doctors and medical 
technicians 
the initial report on the pentagon decision came from cbs news 
pentagon spokesman lt col stuart wagner said he had no 
information on the subject 
meanwhile the army announced wednesday that national guard 
combat brigades from georgia louisiana and mississippi will be put 
on active duty in about a week for possible deployment to the 
persian gulf 
they will be augmented by national guard combat units from 
alabama south carolina and texas to create a combined fighting 
force of about 15100 soldiers the army said 
separately the air force said it was sending an unspecified 
number of oa10 lowlevel observation aircraft to the arabian 
peninsula for operation desert shield and the navy ordered to 
active duty 875 reservists from 13 states and the district of 
columbia 
the air force oa10 planes which are used to direct air and 
ground fire at enemy armored vehicles are deploying saturday from 
davismonthan air force base ariz 
more than 77000 reservists from all military services already 
have been called up for desert shield it is the largest reserve 
activation since the 1961 berlin crisis 
included in the army statement was the first official mention 
that two active divisions the 4th infantry division mechanized 
of fort carson colo and the 5th infantry division mechanized 
of fort polk la may be sent to the gulf as further 
reinforcements beyond the deployments already announced 
the guard brigade from mississippi will be assigned to the 4th 
infantry division and the unit from louisiana will be made part of 
the 5th infantry division bringing both of those heavy units to 
full threebrigade strength the army said 
the army said the divisions with their national guard brigades 
could be used as additions to the force now in saudi arabia or as 
rotation forces to replace units that have been there since early 
in the crisis sparked by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait

moscow plans to pull 200000 troops 
out of asia and reduce its pacific fleet within two years a senior 
soviet official said today challenging the united states to do the 
same 
its time to reduce the remnants of the cold war in the 
asiapacific region said vadim medvedev a close aide to 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
his comments to korean businessmen came on the heels of this 
weeks summit in paris where officials formally declared the cold 
war over in europe 
medvedev a member of the soviet presidents council of 
advisers proposed that leaders in asia meet for military 
consultations to speed up talks on arms control the scaleback of 
forces and reduce tensions 
we are firmly convinced that it is impossible to realize 
progress in the pacific region without the essential removal of 
military confrontation he said building on nuclear missiles 
has been continuing as before and naval exercises have not been 
reduced 
medvedev said that by 1992 soviet soldiers stationed in mongolia 
will be pulled out and the soviet presence in cam ranh bay 
vietnam substantially reduced he said the soviet naval fleet in 
the pacific will be drastically reduced 
it is important for the soviet union and the united states to 
be recognized as partners by ceasing to be military adversaries in 
the region he said despite positive developments there have 
been virtually no changes in the military field 
medvedev said the soviet union supports a north korean proposal 
for the withdrawal of american troops from south korea and backs 
the norths demands that the divided peninsula be made into a 
nuclearfree zone 
about 43000 us troops are stationed in south korea to help 
deter communist aggression north korea has demanded the troops be 
withdrawn and nuclear weapons it claims are stored in south korea 
be removed 
a planned december visit to moscow by south korean president roh 
taewoo is seen as a milestone in sovietkorean relations that may 
lead to reduced tensions in korea medvedev said 
the two nations established full diplomatic relations in 
september 
medvedev said moscow wants to establish relations of a new 
quality with japan and expects gorbachevs visit to tokyo next 
spring to be a turning point

american universitys board of trustees plans 
to hold a special meeting dec 6 to rethink its reported offer of a 
1 million severance package to former president richard berendzen 
that has caused a campus furor 
the board scheduled the meeting this week in response to 
protests over the proposed payout to berendzen who resigned last 
spring while under police investigation for making obscene 
telephone calls from his office 
the trustees authorized the settlement at a closed meeting three 
weeks ago on the condition that berendzen relinquish his remaining 
affiliation as a tenured physics professor the washington post 
reported today 
earlier this week the universitys acting president milton 
greenberg urged the board to discuss the settlement with campus 
groups and reconsider it in order to allay serious rifts 
between the trustees and the rest of the school 
during my entire career including more than 20 years as a 
senior academic administrator never have i seen another 
campusbased issue evoke this degree of anguish greenberg wrote 
never have i seen so many speak with a single voice 
students faculty members and deans have complained that the 
board voted to approve the settlement which is not final without 
consulting anyone on campus 
they are particularly concerned that the trustees acted on a 
tenure question which traditionally is the responsibility of a 
universitys faculty 
some also contend the package is too expensive for a university 
with a relatively small endowment and high costs for students 
berendzens status at au has been ambiguous since his 
resignation last april technically he holds a job as a physics 
professor but he has not worked on campus and has not followed the 
necessary steps to get a sabbatical or a leave 
berendzen pleaded guilty in may to two charges of making obscene 
phone calls he received two 30day prison sentences which were 
suspended on condition that he remain in outpatient psychiatric 
treatment 
berendzens attorney richard marks said neither he nor his 
client would comment

blind hiker bill irwin said today will 
be the best thanksgiving hes ever had after becoming the first 
sightless man to walk the entire 2167mile appalachian trail 
its just an indescribable feeling of gratitude irwin said 
i feel like i did the best i could at the time and hopefully the 
lord feels the same way 
on wednesday a crowd of about 70 people fell silent as irwin 
reached out and touched a sign marking the campground where he 
completed the eightmonth trek 
after the 50yearold hiker prayed silently the crowd broke 
into cheers said david mccasland a freelance writer who traveled 
with irwin during the final two weeks of the hike 
dozens of friends reporters and other hikers who joined irwin 
for the final 24mile leg wednesday backed away and let him walk 
the last tenth of a mile alone 
eighteen fellow members of the peoples memorial christian 
church in irwins hometown who were on hand to see their friend 
finish his trek sang amazing grace as he approached the sign 
marking the end of the epic hike 
irwin was given a commemorative sculpture and his guide dog 
orient received a new harness and a leash 
irwin who set out from the southern end of the trail at 
springer mountain ga during september floods arrived late 
wednesday morning on a snowcovered trail at the remote katahdin 
stream campground 
along the way the broadshouldered irwins worst injury was a 
broken rib sustained when he slipped on a stone and his 50pound 
pack swung over his head slamming him onto a rock 
in maine irwin was swept off his feet while crossing the west 
branch of the piscataquis river and was carried nearly 20 yards 
down the icy stream mccasland said 
he also was delayed for three days in maine by a snowstorm that 
left 28 inches on the ground the sun shone brightly wednesday 
a recovering alcoholic irwin lost his sight nearly two years 
ago to a disease that destroys the retina 
the burlington nc resident decided nearly a year ago to 
attempt the feat as an affirmation of his faith in god sponsors 
have helped pay his expenses irwin was with only his dog for much 
of the time 
he couldnt see the magnificent vistas or trailside sunsets 
during his trek but irwin said the sounds and smells of the 
wilderness provided more than enough beauty

rebel army troops tried to 
seize power thursday in the nominally independent black homeland of 
transkei and clashed with loyalist forces according to south 
african reports 
military ruler maj gen bantu holomisa issued a statement 
saying he was still in control and the coup had failed he said the 
coup was headed by several whites and involved a tiny group of 
dissident soldiers 
holomisa identified the coup leader as a white army captain 
craig duli who had been a senior official in the government he 
said the coup involved six whites and a handful of black troops 
holomisa and the army seized power in transkei in 1987 and set 
up a government that had close ties with the african national 
congress the main black opposition group in south africa 
in recent days he had charged that the south african government 
or other elements were plotting a coup against his government 
south african diplomats in the homeland capital of umtata said 
fighting broke out in the city around dawn thursday when the rebels 
attempted to seize key government buildings shots had been heard 
and roadblocks erected but the diplomats had no details on how 
serious the fighting was 
early this morning there were shots that were heard in parts 
of umtata said south african diplomat gert terblanche reached 
by telephone in umtata 
the independent south african press association said a large 
number of soldiers had reportedly been wounded in the fighting 
it appeared fighting broke out at an army base on the outskirts 
of umtata and the rebels later attempted to seize government 
buildings in the city the news agency said 
transkei with about 275 million people consists of three 
discontiguous areas in the southeast of south africa 
it is one of four nominally independent black homelands set up 
by the south african government in the 1970s and 1980s as part of a 
plan to create separate states for blacks under the apartheid 
system of racial separation 
no country other than south africa recognizes the independent 
homelands most of which have been pressing for reintegration into 
south africa

junk bond king michael milken credited with 
fueling wall streets corporate takeover boom of the 1980s now 
personifies americas change in fortunes with his 10year sentence 
for securities fraud 
it was the toughest penalty imposed in cases arising from the 
the wall street scandals that followed the boom 
the sentence us district judge kimba wood levied wednesday 
could be reduced if milken cooperates fully with prosecutors but 
the stiff term undercut criticism from milken supporters who 
claimed his crimes were merely technical violations 
milken had pleaded guilty to six federal felony counts and 
previously paid 600 million in fines and restitution 
milken 44 stood expressionless as the judge read the sentence 
his wife lori was among about 200 spectators crowding the court 
lawyers scholars and law enforcement officials agreed the term 
was longer than expected and concluded that wood wanted to send a 
strong message that financial crime doesnt pay 
the sentence is entirely justified in light of the severity of 
the crimes milken committed and the risks he created for the 
broader us financial market securities and exchange commission 
chairman richard breeden said 
the lengthy sentence also provides a measure of vindication for 
the government which had been criticized for its zealous 
prosecution of milken 
they were accused of hitting milken with an excessive 98count 
indictment that included charges against his brother lowell in an 
effort to extract a guilty plea 
its an indication from an impartial source that the 
government was right in bringing this case and prosecuting it as 
hard as it did and in bringing him to justice said bruce baird 
who was head of securities fraud in the manhattan us attorneys 
office during the early stages of the milken prosecution 
its stiffer than i would have guessed but every day of it 
richly deserved he said 
milken is the former drexel burnham lambert inc financier whose 
pioneering use of highyield junk bonds raised billions of dollars 
in capital much of it used to finance the hostile corporate 
takeovers that characterized an era 
he faced a maximum 28 years in prison he already has agreed to 
pay 200 million in fines and place 400 million in a fund to 
compensate investors 
milken was ordered to report to federal custody on march 4 
1991 he will be eligible for parole after serving at least 
onethird of his term meaning he could not be released until 1994 
a prison was not designated 
milken also must perform 1800 hours of community service during 
each of three years probation that equals nearly 35 hours a week 
wood said she would consider reducing the prison term if the 
government made such a request based on milkens future 
cooperation which is required under the plea agreement 
the government has said it is continuing its investigation into 
lawbreaking on wall street including transactions involving milken 
and drexel 
linked to scandal by former speculator ivan boesky in late 1986 
milken had steadfastly denied any wrongdoing and pledged to fight 
his march 1989 indictment 
he changed his mind in april after months of negotiations at 
sentencing wood indicated that his initial refusal to cooperate 
worked against him 
milken rode to the top in success in financial wealth and now 
hes hit the bottom said attorney arthur mathews whose client 
paul bilzerian received a fouryear term until wednesday the 
longest such penalty in the wall street trading scandals 
defense attorney arthur liman asked the judge for community 
service only saying milkens crimes were deviations from an 
otherwise admirable life 
liman cited milkens 360 million in charitable contributions 
beginning before the federal investigation and other endeavors 
im not a psychologist i cant offer your honor an 
explanation as to how michael slipped liman said i can just 
attest to those values that come out constantly 
but wood said milkens crimes were not merely technical 
violations brought on by milkens overzealous desire to help 
clients as the defense maintained she said milken obstructed the 
governments investigation and balked at early efforts to win his 
cooperation 
milken pleaded guilty to conspiracy securities and mail fraud 
violating federal securities reporting requirements filing false 
information with regulators and aiding the filing of a false tax 
return

congressional investigators say the energy 
department failed to take prompt action after inspections showed 
some guards at nuclear weapons facilities could not shoot straight 
and did not know how to handcuff intruders 
the general accounting office an investigating arm of congress 
said wednesday that some shortcomings uncovered in 1985 inspections 
at the departments los alamos argonne sandia and savannah river 
sites went uncorrected for five years 
the gao report was requested by the house energy subcommittee on 
oversight and investigation and by sens pete domenici rnm and 
jeff bingaman dnm after a 10week strike by the contract 
security force at the los alamos national laboratory last year 
the congressional investigators said many guards hired as 
replacements during the strike did not have the required skills 
they also said an unannounced exercise conducted in april showed 
that 75 percent of the regular security force failed at one or more 
of the skills required 
for example when the participants encountered an adversarial 
situation many failed to stay behind cover and assess the 
situation the report said instead they left their cover and 
walked up to the potential adversaries to ask what they were 
doing 
consequently it said many of the adversaries were able to take 
out a visible weapon theoretically kill the guard and make off 
with classified documents 
it said 24 participants and hostages were killed during the 
test 
the energy department referred inquiries about the report to los 
alamos where anna bachicha a public affairs officer said the 
report was just released today and we just received a copy of it 
this afternoon and have not had time to fully assess it

nearly a quarter million people in texas and 
new mexico live in impoverished communities along the border that 
lack sewer systems or adequate water supplies congressional 
investigators say 
a general accounting office study of six texas counties along 
the rio grande found 198000 people are living in 842 colonias 
unincorporated rural subdivisions with frequently substandard 
housing inadequate roads a lack of running water or adequate 
sewage systems 
sixty percent of the colonias surveyed have water supplies but 
less than 1 percent or a total of three have a public sewage 
disposal system said gao the investigative arm of congress 
im very concerned that the lack of proper waste systems for 
these colonias poses a growing health risk to residents and their 
children its also contributing to environmental problems along 
the border said rep kika de la garza dtexas who requested 
the study 
de la garza chairman of the house agriculture committee 
released the study wednesday and said it substantiates the need

two medflies were found in california just 
two weeks after the state said it had wiped out an infestation that 
lasted nearly 16 months and cost 52 million to fight agriculture 
officials announced 
this is a revolting development e leon spaugy los angeles 
county agricultural commissioner said wednesday i had hoped we 
could get through winter without finding any 
spaugy said the latest outbreak could have been caused by 
residents bringing illegal fruit from outside the country 
the unmated female mediterranean fruit flies were trapped in 
residential neighborhoods in upland and nearby rancho cucamonga on 
nov 15 
fly trapping will intensify around the sites where the two were 
found said don schreiber san bernardino county deputy 
agricultural commissioner 
two weeks ago officials declared victory in a nearly 16month 
52 million battle against the cropdestroying pest 
theres no question in my mind now that they never eradicated 
them from this area said richard rice a university of 
california davis entomologist we had better stay pretty light 
on our feet 
rice said it took a week for authorities to identify the flies 
as wild and that delay is unacceptable because the medfly 
reproduces so quickly 
thats a serious flaw in their strategy right there he 
said its just unforgivable you cant give medflies that window 
of opportunity

j seward johnson whose statues are so 
lifelike a security guard once shot one envisions a downtoearth 
rendering of abraham lincoln for the town where the 16th president 
delivered his most famous speech 
johnsons lincoln will be near the town square but on the 
sidewalk instead of a pedestal and aside a likeness of a 20th 
century tourist the tourist dressed in slacks and a cableknit 
sweater holds a copy of the gettysburg address as he listens to 
the president 
the artist who lives near princeton nj has been 
commissioned to create the statue for this rural pennsylvania town 
where lincoln delivered the famed civil war speech 127 years ago 
johnson perched on an antique chair in the office of civil war 
scholar gabor boritt said the statute is designed to celebrate 
lincolns humanity bring him off a pedestal celebrate the 
greatness of him as a human being 
another purpose is to show that the gettysburg address was 
still a meaningful document today 
the 268word address whose opening four score and seven 
years ago is familiar to millions is regarded by scholars as 
one of the most forceful and elegant speeches ever made 
lincoln delivered the address at a dedication of the national 
military cemetery in gettysburg on nov 19 1863 
in johnsons artwork lincoln is saying something to the tourist 
as he points to the nearby wills house where he stayed the night 
before the speech 
he might have been saying how uncomfortable the bed was 
johnson said with a laugh as he flexed his long thick fingers 
whatever it is the fellow is a little bit in awe of him 
johnson hopes to have the artwork completed in time for next 
novembers annual gettysburg celebration 
a model has been on display around town for several weeks and 
the reception has been positive johnson said he resisted 
suggestions that he replace the tourists sweater with a jacket 
but agreed to some minor changes 
on something like this i feel an artist has to be very 
sensitive to the people who have to live with it he said 
he was commissioned for the work by the lincoln fellowship of 
pennsylvania which sponsors the annual ceremony marking the 
speech the group has sought a statue honoring lincoln for nearly 
50 years 
the hope has been here for a long long time and finally we 
are doing it said boritt a professor of history at gettysburg 
college he said the lincoln fellowship is trying to raise 100000 
to pay for the statue and provide a maintenance fund 
we are willing to accept a dollar and we will accept 
10000 boritt said 
the figures will be cast in bronze but they will wear real 
clothes coated with a plasticlike resin 
johnsons lifelike sculptures are displayed in 26 states the 
district of columbia and several foreign countries 
he tells countless tales of drivers who try to pick up an 
umbrellatoting statue in the classic cabhailing pose or of people 
who try to strike up conversations with figures on a park bench 
but one of his favorite stories involves the statue that was 
shot by a security guard answering a silent alarm at a house in los 
angeles no intruder was found 
it frightened the guard so much that he shot the sculpture 
johnson said the more you can fool them the better it is

fiveyearold nicolette folsom sat in the 
grass by the graves of her parents and baby sister in the hillside 
cemetery near her home and showed off an awards certificate she won 
at school 
she spoke quietly holding the certificate skyward 
i brought this home and we put it on the refrigerator but i 
wanted you to see it she said im doing real good in school 
and im happy in school 
june kenney nicolettes grandmother and legal guardian 
recounted the scene wednesday thanksgiving the first holiday 
since aids and suicide claimed all but one member of the folsom 
family will be difficult she said 
nicolettes mother 29yearold jennifer and her 3yearold 
sister angela died of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
earlier this fall 
her father doug fatally shot himself in june after watching 
his family struggle for two years with the killer virus 
jennifer said this summer she believed she contracted the 
disease through a blood transfusion during an emergency 
appendectomy in a massachusetts hospital in 1979 before blood 
supplies were tested for the aids virus 
angie she said contracted the virus during the pregnancy or 
later from breast feeding nicolette has routinely tested negative 
for the virus she will be tested again in five years mrs kenney 
said 
her concept is they all have gone to some other place that 
doug is fishing her mother is knitting and angie is playing 
she said thats her concept of heaven she thinks theyll all be 
together 
nicolette sees an art therapist weekly to help her cope with the 
loss 
we try to tell her that everybody doesnt die young her 
grandmother said 
mrs kenney said nicolette has little worry people and little 
worry stones that she talks to at night she talks to her 
mother once in a while she does get emotional she said 
everybody is still trying to get through it its not over 
yet for sure said fred kenney jennifers brother 
each person handles it differently for some of us its been 
a tough time because we havent had time to mourn yet now we have 
time to sit back and reflect he said 
for june and don kenney the tragedy has been extra difficult 
they have once again assumed the role of parents to a young child 
mrs kenney has also begun speaking to community organizations 
and support groups for the families of aids victims she also is 
using notes kept by jennifer over the course of her illness to 
write a childrens book on coping with the death of a parent from 
aids 
the family is also sending out about 600 cards of thanks to 
people across the country who sent messages of support as well as 
gifts and money after jennifer spoke publicly of her familys 
struggle 
jennifer said at that time that she wanted people to know that 
aids is not only a bigcity problem vermont does have aids the 
children of this generation need to be taught now because we dont 
know if there is going to be a cure she said 
one of the things were thankful for is the fact that she 
didnt die fruitlessly mrs kenney said wednesday but we all 
have our moments each and every one of us there are times when 
the sky is blue and sunny and we think of things we used to do 
with jenny and shes not there

the surprise finding earlier this year that a 76 
heart attack drug is just as good as one costing 29 times more has 
been called into question by new research released today 
the latest report bolsters the widespread skepticism among us 
physicians that greeted the release of a major italian study 
finding that the two clotdissolving medicines are equally 
effective 
both drugs are intended to break up clots that plug that hearts 
arteries during heart attacks if these clots are removed within 
four hours or so victims may escape permanent damage to their 
hearts 
the chief rivals for this lucrative market are tpa which costs 
2200 per treatment and streptokinase which costs 76 early 
us studies suggested that tpa worked better and the medicine 
quickly gained about twothirds of the us market share 
the real issue around the world is whether streptokinase is 
comparable to tpa said dr judith hsia principal author of the 
latest report its much cheaper and many countries including 
the united states would prefer to give it if it is just as good 
some thought that issue was settled last march when an italian 
study of 12490 men found that the two drugs appear equally 
effective and safe for use in routine conditions of care it 
found that about 23 percent of patients died or suffered serious 
heart damage no matter which medicine they received 
however that study made little use of a blood thinner called 
heparin which is routinely given with tpa by us doctors the new 
study shows that heparin is essential for tpa to work properly 
the latest study called the heparinaspirin reperfusion trial 
or hart was directd by dr allan m ross of george washington 
university and published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
if you use tpa in a fashion that doesnt allow those opened 
arteries to stay open then the gain will presumably be lost 
thats the implication of hart said ross 
dr lawrence cohen of yale university agreed that the latest 
work casts doubt on the italian teams conclusion 
i think there is a distinct possibility that the survival rate 
might have been better in the tpa group had adjuvant therapy 
heparin been given in an optimal fashion cohen said 
a new study called gusto for global utilization of 
streptokinase and tpa recently began on 33000 people to settle 
whether tpa and heparin together save more lives than 
streptokinase 
answers to these questions are important financially as well as 
medically since the market for clotdissolving drugs is huge an 
estimated 15 million americans suffer heart attacks each year 
tpa is a genetically engineered human protein that is made by 
genentech streptokinase produced from bacteria is made by 
hoechst ag of germany a new entrant in the field is the 
genetically engineered eminase which is made by smithkline beecham 
and costs 1700 
tpa acts quickly in the blood stream to break up clots but the 
medicine almost immediately disappears when it is withdrawn 
streptokinase works more slowly but continues to linger in the body 
for hours after the treatment 
in the latest study researchers randomly assigned 205 heart 
attack victims to receive tpa either with or without heparin 
eighteen hours later the onceclogged arteries were flowing freely 
in 82 percent of those who got heparin and in 52 percent of those 
who did not this suggests that without heparin new clots 
frequently formed again in their arteries

space shuttle atlantis sustained 
hardly any damage during a secret pentagon mission that began with 
an unusual nighttime launch and ended with a rare florida 
touchdown 
its probably one of the cleanest birds ive ever seen come 
back after a mission james harrington nasas director of 
shuttle operations said wednesday 
atlantis and its five astronauts landed tuesday at kennedy space 
center after five days in space the shuttle was diverted to 
florida because of bad weather at the main touchdown site in 
california 
as of wednesday afternoon atlantis brakes had not been removed 
for inspection but were thought to be in good shape harrington 
said the only wheel damage was scuffed rims 
during the pentagon mission which had to be extended a day 
because of bad weather for landing at edwards air force base 
calif the crew deployed a spy satellite sources said the 
satellite will eavesdrop on iraqi communications in the persian 
gulf 
it was the sixth shuttle landing at kennedy and the first in 
five years discovery the last spaceship to land in florida blew 
a tire and sustained brake damage in 1985 
only three of the 28000 heatresistant tiles covering the 
shuttle will need to be replaced harrington said the three tiles 
have goodsized nicks he said 
usually the shuttles tail surface is peppered with dirt kicked 
up from the natural runways at edwards harrington said 
we had a good clean mission a good clean landing and very 
little tile damage overall harrington said 
the national aeronautics and space administration will save 
about 1 million and a week in processing time because atlantis 
landed at kennedy and thus avoided a crosscountry trip atlantis 
next scheduled flight is in april 
the florida landing was especially gratifying for kennedy 
workers who had been frustrated for months by hydrogen leaks that 
grounded atlantis and columbia 
you could light up a christmas tree with all the smiles on the 
troops around here harrington said 
next up is columbia which is expected to lift off around dec 2 
with an astronomical observatory nasa officials are expected to 
set a launch date after a review tuesday 
the mission has been on hold since hydrogen leaks grounded the 
shuttle in may

proper papers and credentials vermeule said 
he said relicas of the lysippos sculpture were in every 
shrine bath gymnasium from gaul to mesopotamia 
the fragment is owned jointly by the boston museum and 
collectors leon levy and shelby white

californians seeking cheap housing have 
helped turn this oncequiet far town into one of the nations 
fastestgrowing cities but growth has brought bigcity problems 
like crime drugs and crowded schools 
fresno unfortunately is growing up said nurse tom 
stoeckel at valley medical center which has treated 
cocaineaddicted babies in its obstetrics ward and where one or two 
gunshot victims routinely arrive each day 
fresno is developing a losangeles type situation we now 
have driveby shootings stoeckel said 
the city of more than 350000 also has crowded schools street 
gangs and an inversion layer that makes it one of the worst smog 
basins in the nation but city officials say the growth didnt 
catch them by surprise and with an abundance of open land 
remaining they dont expect it to ebb anytime soon 
we were forecasting this kind of growth in 1981 and 1982 
said al solis the citys development director 
in 1980 fresno had 218202 residents preliminary 1990 census 
figures increased the total to 350794 a 61 percent growth rate 
that boosted fresno from the nations 65thlargest city to 47th it 
also made fresno the fastestgrowing of the nations 50 largest 
cities 
officials say growth was spurred by cheap housing an aggressive 
annexation program that vastly expanded the central california 
citys borders and an influx of asian immigrants 
an average fresno home costs about 100000 compared to 
250000 in san francisco to the north or los angeles to the south 
among those who flocked to the area in search of cheap housing 
were thousands of southeast asian refugees mostly hmong in 1979 
officials say there were about 30 hmong in fresno compared to 
about 48000 today 
as the growth boom took place fresno rapidly expanded its 
borders annexing 21951 acres of adjacent county land a move that 
brought 38000 former county residents into the city 
highlighting the problems was a labor day rampage in which one 
person was killed and eight wounded police say four teenagers 
associated with one of about 20 active street gangs went on a 
fourhour shooting and robbery spree attacking people at random 
growth has also caused crowding in some schools and school 
officials have switched many campuses to yearround programs to 
accomodate added students 
solis said environmental problems including water shortages 
could eventually slow fresnos population boom 
several wells drilled in north fresno produced water polluted by 
years of agricultural pesticide use he said 
officials say the citys location in central californias san 
joaquin valley with its natural inversion layer also gives it the 
potential for serious smog problems 
but despite the problems solis predicted growth will continue 
for several years to come 
we dont have the limitations that other cities in california 
have he said as long as the demand is there and the supply 
well grow

two earthquakes about an hour apart 
rattled the anchorage area shortly after another quake hit the 
aleutian island area more than 1000 miles away there were no 
reports of injuries or damage 
the first of the anchorage quakes measuring 34 on the richter 
scale struck at 916 pm local time it was centered about 20 
miles north of the city said scientists at the national earthquake 
information center at golden colo 
the second quake measuring 41 hit at 1019 pm and was 
centered about 40 miles southwest of anchorage authorities said 
a magnitude 53 quake struck the tip of the aleutian islands 
about 1100 miles to the southwest at 814 pm anchorage time 
officials said the quake was felt by people at the adak naval 
station about 50 miles away 
a 56magnitude temblor also struck the central aleutians 
tuesday afternoon 
seismologists said they didnt know if any of the quakes were 
related 
quakes measuring above 5 on the richter scale are capable of 
causing significant damage if they hit heavily populated areas 
the 1964 alaska quake that killed more than 100 people measured 
84 on the richter scale while the san francisco quake of 1906 was 
estimated to register 83 the october 1989 quake that hit northern 
california measured 71

it looks like a deepsea thanksgiving is in 
store for a humpback whale after it spent the past few days 
exploring new jerseys polluted waterways 
the 30foot to 35footlong whale which was spotted in the 
hackensack river and newark bay was escorted through new york 
harbor wednesday and out into the open ocean by new jersey state 
police boats with the help of a marine mammal expert 
the same whale has been spotted in rivers around new jersey 
before said bob schoelkopf director of the marine mammal 
stranding center which is based in brigantine nj 
we immediately recognized it as a humpback whale that was 
originally spotted in new jersey two years ago schoelkopf said 
he said it appeared in the delaware river two years ago and last 
year in both the shark river and the raritan river 
so it does know its way around and for some reason prefers to 
come in and then head out again schoelkopf said he said he 
recognized the animal by a distinctive notch in its dorsal fin 
humpback whales are common in the atlantic ocean off the 
northeastern united states he said 
workers at a public service electric amp gas co plant were the 
first to see the whale on its latest visit as it swam past the 
generating station late tuesday afternoon 
the whale was swimming up river as though it wanted to look 
and see what was going on and when the tide switched it switched 
direction schoelkopf said 
we essentially herded it by staying behind it and on either 
side so it would only go in one direction schoelkopf said 
adding that the whale might come back 
this may not be the end of the story he may end up taking a 
turn and going somewhere else he said its hard to predict 
these animals

years after the tick bite that triggers lyme 
disease people with lingering infections may suffer memory loss 
shooting pains and other signs of nerve damage the doctor who 
discovered the disease reported today 
antibiotics usually relieve the lingering symptoms although 
recovery is seldom complete 
this is similar to syphilis said dr allen c steere 
although the neurological symptoms and consequences are 
different in both diseases there are long periods of latent 
infection in the brain followed by a variety of neurological 
disorders 
lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by tiny ticks 
that are usually carried by deer and mice it is common throughout 
the northeast midwest and california 
usually the first sign of lyme disease is a red circular rash 
around the tick bite it is often accompanied by fever fatigue 
aches and other flulike miseries in more advanced stages the 
disease can cause arthritis as well as the neurological problems 
steere who first recognized the disease in old lyme conn 
about 15 years ago was senior author of the latest report written 
with two colleagues at new england medical center in boston it was 
published in todays new england journal of medicine 
the doctors studied 27 patients with chronic neurological 
symptoms that typically began a year or two after the start of 
their infections 
all but three of them had signs of mild brain disease or 
encephalopathy these included memory problems such as forgetting 
names missing appointments and misplacing objects others felt 
very sleepy during the day or were troubled by extreme 
irritability growing angry over what would ordinarily be minor 
annoyances 
some also showed subtle language difficulties and trouble 
finding words most were able to keep working but three quit their 
jobs three cut back their hours and two retired early 
the other major category of disorder was polyneuropathy a 
disorder of the nerves outside the brain people often had back 
aches with shooting pains tingling sensations and lack of feeling 
in their hands and feet 
the researchers found that a twoweek course of antibiotic 
injections significantly improved the way the patients felt but 
six months later more than onethird had either relapsed or were 
no better 
the doctors speculated that the treatment failed because it did 
not wipe out the bacteria completely or because the patients 
nervous systems were irreversibly damaged

contributions from ethnic hmong refugees on behalf of the united 
lao national liberation front also known as the neo hom 
lao family community funnels government aid to many of the 
approximately 100000 hmong who live in california and also 
provides english classes job training programs and counseling to 
hmong residents 
some people who refused to pay were threatened with violence and 
some refugee families who refused to deal with the lao family 
community lost thousands of dollars in welfare benefits said 
alicia martinez director of the state department of social 
services civil rights bureau 
martinez said her own life has been threatened since her agency 
began its investigation 18 months ago 
the two groups were founded by former lao army gen vang pao a 
hmong who led a ciabacked insurgency after the communist pathet 
lao gained control of the country 
vang pao and other officials from the neo hom and lao family 
deny any wrongdoing 
yes there are some people working in lao family who have been 
donating money for the front but i think that is within their 
right said lao family director gayle morrison 
the civil rights bureau has recommended that public agencies 
suspend lao familys contracts worth about 5 million in fiscal 
1989 
as a result of the civil rights bureau report the six counties 
that deal with lao family have suspended contracts pending a 
review martinez said 
the state attorney generals office is also investigating the 
groups but no criminal charges have been filed said deputy 
attorney general james dutton 
the neo hom with 9000 to 10000 members in the united states 
is the largest of several lao resistance groups from its santa ana 
headquarters about 30 miles southeast of los angeles it has 
legally solicited money for years to finance a guerrilla war 
against laos communist government 
a reclusive hill people from northern laos many hmongs had 
little contact with the outside world before joining a 
ussupported campaign against communist insurgents in the early 
1970s when laos prous government fell thousands of hmongs 
fled to the united states 
about a dozen families told investigators lao family officials 
threatened that they would not receive benefits unless they 
contributed to the neo hom martinez said 
figures on how much money was allegedly extorted were not 
immediately available but victims were reportedly ordered to make 
initial contributions of up to 100 each and then pay monthly 
amounts of as much as 5 
officials learned of the alleged extorition from two people who 
refused to deal with lao family 
song moua spokesman for the national liberation front said the 
group has not tried to extort money all donations go to resistance 
fighters and refugees still in asia he said 
martinez said she believed many hmong gave in to the alleged 
extortion demands because they became used to corruption in their 
homeland 
i think a lot of people took it as part of the system she 
said they experienced it there and they were experiencing it 
here

sana yemen ap secretary of state james a baker iii 
arrived in yemen today to seek its support for a united nations 
resolution authorizing military force to drive iraq out of kuwait 
baker has traveled the globe in recent weeks on an intense 
lobbying effort to obtain the approval of the 15 un security 
council nations for such a resolution 
the united states holds the rotating presidency of the council 
until the end of this month and had initially wanted to propose the 
resolution before it ceded the chair to yemen in december 
if this is going to happen baker said wednesday that is 
a process that must begin at some time this is the 22nd of 
november and november has 30 days 
baker was to present the us case to the countrys president 
gen ali abdullah saleh and foreign minister abdulkarim 
aliryani yemens government has publicly sided with iraq in the 
persian gulf crisis 
the secretary of state who had accompanied president bush to 
saudi arabia split off from the presidents thanksgiving visit to 
military forces in the saudi desert he is the first highranking 
us official to visit to the red sea state since bush stopped here 
in 1986 as vice president 
bush met wednesday in jiddah with the exiled emir of kuwait 
jabber alahmed alsabah the president said afterward that fresh 
steps should be taken this month in the united nations to free 
kuwait 
yemen located on the southwest corner of the arabian peninsula 
is the only arab nation on the security council it has in the past 
shown some sympathy toward iraq and has criticized the military 
buildup of us forces in saudi arabia 
iraqi president saddam hussein sent his foreign minister tariq 
aziz to yemen on tuesday to deliver a message on the gulf 
situation according to the official yemeni news agency 
officials said baker would return to jiddah tonight and might 
meet friday with malaysian officials malaysia located on the 
southeastern tip of asia also is a member of the security council 
since last weekend baker has met with the foreign ministers of 
eight nations on the council next weekend he pays a visit to 
colombia where he will confer with president cesar gaviria 
baker said wednesday the united states and the soviet union had 
unanimity of opinion with regard to the problems in the gulf 
baker held lengthy meetings with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze in paris this week during the 34nation summit of the 
conference on security and cooperation in europe 
shevardnadze had said in paris that the security council should 
take stock of things and if need be adopt new resolutions 
however neither he nor gorbachev endorsed the idea of a resolution 
to authorize use of force 
the security council has approved 10 resolutions against iraq 
since its aug 2 invasion of its oilrich neighbor they impose an 
economic boycott on iraq and occupied kuwait call for iraqs 
unconditional withdrawal and insist upon restoration of kuwaits 
previous government 
yemen has abstained from voting on half of those according to a 
state department count 
none of the resolutions authorizes military action but they 
leave the door open to other measures if iraq fails to respond to 
the steps

margaret thatcher has been every bit the iron lady 
durable rigid formidable in battle 
since taking power in 1979 as britains first woman prime 
minister mrs thatcher has often been unpopular often a minority 
in britains alliances and even in her own cabinet and never 
in doubt 
but on thursday she announced her resignation amid a strong 
leadership challenge from her former defense minister michael 
heseltine 
only winston churchill rivaled mrs thatchers commanding 
profile in 20th century britain and no one approached her record 
of three straight general election victories 
in 1980 when others shirked from the radical freemarket cures 
of thatcherism mrs thatcher scolded her fellow conservatives 
you turn if you want to the ladys not for turning 
she dismantled britains version of socialism crushed 
obstructive labor unions led a military victory against argentina 
in the falkland islands and preached military readiness to the 
western alliance 
asked what she had changed in her country her answer was 
simple everything 
we have raised britain in the respect of the world from what 
it was broke bankrupt unwilling to defend itself properly 
she said in 1987 we have i think transformed britain 
in the 1980s thenpresident ronald reagan was her friend and 
ideological soulmate but she was one of the first western leaders 
to recognize soviet president mikhail s gorbachev as someone we 
can do business with 
even before she became prime minister the soviet press had 
tagged her as the iron lady a title she wore proudly 
a political outsider mrs thatcher was proud of imposing the 
values she had learned from her father a smalltown grocer on a 
political establishment grounded in wealth and privilege 
she led the conservative party to election victories without 
ever winning the affection of most of her people throughout her 
career she was fortunate in her opponents 
she was elected party leader on may 4 1975 ousting edward 
heath after he had lost two national elections in a row 
in 1979 her election was insured by popular disgust with high 
inflation and labor unrest under the labor party government 
when her own popularity ebbed in 1982 argentina invaded the 
falklands the surge of national pride that followed the reconquest 
carried her triumphantly through the 1983 election 
she was also helped by the split in the labor party which 
produced a new party of the center so that the conservatives won 
elections without winning majorities of the popular vote 
after the collapse of the iron curtain when her gospel of 
military preparedness began to appear passe iraqi president saddam 
hussein invaded kuwait on aug 2 once again she was the best 
friend of an american president backing up tough talk with ships 
tanks and troops 
the political left loathed her and had good reason to fear her 
liberals accused her of exacerbating divisions between rich and 
poor and of undermining free speech 
peter jenkins a leading liberal columnist said after a decade 
of thatcherism that she had overthrown the existing order 
changed the political map and put her country on its feet again 
she did all this with ruthlessness and much injustice and at a 
high cost in human misery but she did it commented jenkins 
for the majority who had jobs she raised living standards 
dramatically average earnings were up by nearly onethird and 
more britons owned their homes 
thatcherism was all about free markets and private enterprise 
she sold much of the industry the labor government had 
nationalized turning such moneylosers as steel and british 
airways into profitable enterprises 
her success deeply affected the labor party which moved sharply 
to the center in hope of regaining power 
to her admirers battling maggie was a national savior who ended 
britains postwar cycle of confrontation and decline to her 
detractors she was an antiunion bull set free in a china shop 
destroying revered institutions 
in 1981 after she began implementing her rigorous policies and 
unemployment soared to a record 3 million mrs thatcher was rated 
the most unpopular prime minister since opinion polls began 
even when she had become a sort of national institution polls 
regularly indicated twothirds of britons disliked her personally 
similar majorities also said they respected her and courage was 
one of the qualities they admired 
she survived unscathed from an irish republican army bomb that 
killed five people at the 1984 party convention in brighton 
you have to cope with it she said because if you didnt 
and they intimidated you out of doing the work you have been 
elected to do it would be the end of democracy 
in foreign policy britain under mrs thatcher was unequivocally 
proamerican 
in 1986 she was alone among the allies in associating herself 
with the us bombing of libya allowing the bombers to fly from 
british bases 
when the iron curtain crumbled in 1989 and a united germany 
emerged as europes new superpower mrs thatcher appeared 
sidelined 
but she reemerged as the leader most willing to rush to 
americas side with troops in the persian gulf crisis 
mrs thatcher fought mighty battles with fellow european 
community leaders resisting attempts to turn the community into a 
sort of united states of europe 
born oct 13 1925 margaret hilda roberts learned her values of 
thrift discipline and industry from her father a grocer in the 
small town of grantham in central england 
she became involved in politics at oxford university where she 
won a chemistry degree in 1947 
her electoral career began in the traditional way slogging 
through hopeless campaigns in 1950 and 1951 in districts where the 
conservatives had no hope 
she married wealth businessman denis thatcher in 1951 and their 
twins carol and mark came two years later 
mrs thatcher was elected to parliament in 1958 for finchley a 
middleclass north london district she was minister of pensions 
and national insurance from 196163 under prime ministers harold 
macmillan and lord home edward heath made her education secretary 
in his cabinet of 197074 
against formidable odds including her social origins and her 
sex she won a contest for the party leadership in 1975 w 
hile more prominent conservatives held back from a challenge 
mrs thatcher plunged in winning so many votes in the first round 
that heath resigned 
the 1975 party election was the start of what biographer hugo 
young called an era in which an ordinary politician laboring 
under many disadvantages grew into an international figure who did 
some extraordinary things to her country

us troops greeted 
commanderinchief george bush on thanksgiving day with an 
overriding message lets do something now or go home 
because of security precautions bushs whirlwind sevenhour 
visit to us and allied forces in eastern saudi arabia was so 
shrouded in secrecy that troops didnt know who should be putting 
on the spit and polish 
the presidents itinerary included a meeting with about 2000 
us and allied personnel at an air base turkey dinner with about 
1200 soldiers in the desert a thanksgiving service on a us navy 
ship with about 1500 sailors and an address to about 1500 
marines seabees and british troops in a speech broadcast by armed 
forces radio 
bush and wife barbara got a rousing welcome from a sunbaked 
crowd of several thousand troops at the main us air base in 
dhahran where he spoke from an airport platform in front of parked 
warplanes bush wearing khaki pants and a blue shirt waded into a 
sea of military personnel dressed in desert camouflage uniforms to 
shake hands and pose for pictures 
although the troops cheered bush they were largely silent when 
he said he would not keep americans in the gulf a single day 
longer than necessary 
in a frontpage commentary wednesday the englishlanguage saudi 
gazette called the presidents visit a milestone in saudiamerican 
relations 
the newspaper said bush won saudi hearts by sending troops to 
defend the country and will win saudi minds if he affirms that the 
united states will not let any mideast country terrorize its 
neighbors with weapons of mass destruction 
many servicemen welcomed the presidents visit as a 
moralebooster some said it showed america was standing tough 
but a few said it was no big deal appearing more interested in 
the turkey and trimmings laid on for them and in listening to a 
live broadcast of the detroit lions vs denver broncos football 
game from pontiac mich 
i think its exciting i wish hed come and eat with us 
said mrs law who works fulltime for the alabama national guard 
id tell him were ready to do something were ready to get it 
over with so we can go home 
sgt 1st class mickey kershaw 37 of west islip ny said if 
he had the chance hed tell bush id rather do it now than do it 
five years from now when this guy saddam hussein nukes me and 
the family i intend to have 
staff sgt mike lytle of langley air force base va said 
nobody wants bloodshed but americans are impatient and nobody 
wants to sit here six months and wait for sanctions to take 
full effect 
sgt daniel ralph 27 of philadelphia an army food inspector 
who was checking out turkeys in a large warehouse said bushs 
visit is bound to help morale 
but army reserve spec bobby lampkin 34 of eastman ga said 
its no biggie theres nothing he could tell me to justify us 
being here 
chief warrant officer wes wolf 42 of monterey calif the 
military food czar said 999 percent of the gulf forces were 
dining on fresh turkey ham and roast beef with a shrimp cocktail 
appetizer lots of fruit and vegetables sweet or mashed potatoes 
and a choice of five kinds of pie for dessert 
that works out to 60000 pounds of rolled turkey 2000 whole 
turkeys 70000 pounds of roast beef 45000 pounds of ham 45000 
pies and tens of thousands of pounds of other trimmings he said 
the saudi government paid for half the dinner and the main saudi 
food contractor arab supplies and trading has donated 230000 
candy bars 
only one or two military units were eating prepackaged tvstyle 
turkey dinners known as trations wolf said but just in case 
there were 600000 stashed in a warehouse 
no matter what kind of dinner they ate most soldiers said 
theyd still rather be home 
its really hard for me three years in a row being away from 
my family said anibal cabezas 23 of new york who is with the 
82nd aviation brigade it seems every time the holidays come we 
have to go on a mission but its a job we have to get done thats

foreign minister qian qichen and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze will meet friday near the 
chinesesoviet border apparently to discuss the persian gulf 
crisis a soviet embassy spokesman said today 
press attache yuri lyssenko said he had no further details about 
the talks to be held in urumqi in chinas far western xinjiang 
uygur autonomous region 
asked if the meeting would focus on developments in the gulf and 
related diplomatic efforts lyssenko replied i suppose so it 
may be since mr qian has just returned from that region 
qian returned nov 13 from a middle east diplomatic mission that 
took him to iraq jordan saudi arabia and egypt during his stop 
in cairo qian met with secretary of state james a baker iii 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing reiterated chinas 
position on the gulf crisis during the weekly news briefing today 
but he did not mention the planned chinesesoviet talks 
as long as there is still a gleam of hope for a peaceful 
settlement unremitting efforts should be continued toward this 
li said 
lyssenko said he did not know if qian and shevardnadze would 
discuss a possible un security council resolution sanctioning an 
attack on iraqi forces to dislodge them from kuwait the united 
states has sought support from security council members for such a 
resolution 
during the news briefing li called the possible use of military 
force in the gulf a very serious and complicated issue which 
would have a major impact so it must be handled with great care 
and should not be hurried through the urumqi meeting will be the 
second set of talks held on short notice between shevardnadze and 
qian since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
they met sept 1 in the northeastern city of harbin with the 
gulf situation as the major topic 
such meetings reflect the new deepening cooperation between the 
two countries since they normalized relations in 1989 ending a 
threedecade split the soviet union and china as permanent 
security council members have veto power over resolutions in 
addition to the united states the other permanent members are 
britain and france 
chinese officials have stressed that all efforts to find a 
peaceful settlement to the gulf crisis must be exhausted before 
considering the use of military force 
china has supported all security council resolutions aimed at 
forcing iraq from kuwait but chinese officials have refused to say 
how the china would vote if a measure seeking authorization for 
military force comes before the council

chancellor helmut kohl called today for a 
peaceful resolution of the persian gulf crisis and said the time 
is ripe to solve the arabisraeli tensions and the lebanon 
conflict as well 
so far most western leaders have resisted tying efforts to 
peacefully resolve the persian gulf crisis in with the search for a 
solution to the palestinian conflict and lebanons crisis 
in a speech to parliament the chancellor also repeated his 
support for the creation of a united states of europe 
kohls government has been put on the spot by iraqs 
announcement on tuesday that it would free all german hostages 
apparently in an attempt to drive a wedge into the western alliance 
that is trying to force saddam hussein to relinquish kuwait 
the chancellor said that at the paris summit that ended on 
wednesday he found a unanimous wish to seek a peaceful solution 
to the crisis saddam precipitated with iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
none of us wants war the chancellor said stressing the 
unified front against iraq 
kohl said the leaders in paris also agreed that the time is 
ripe for the other conflicts in the middle east to be solved by 
negotiations 
there wont be any lasting peace and security in the middle 
east and near east until the arabisraeli conflict and the lebanon 
conflict are settled by negotiations kohl told the lawmakers 
drawing a round of applause

to build a nuclearweapons arsenal gives a real sense of 
urgency to the us military showdown with baghdad

are not hear on some exercise we are not walking away until our 
mission is done 
his voice rising bush declared in a message to saddam hussein 
free the hostages all the hostages and free them today or youre 
going to pay the price he was referring to the nearly one 
thousand americans believed to be still in iraq and kuwait most of 
them either in detention or not allowed to leave 
yet the troops were largely silent when bush said he would not 
keep americans in the gulf a single day longer than necessary 
that means awhile one soldier commented lets do it 
another called out lets go get em today so we can go home

resignation of deputy prime minister grigory yavlinsky coauthor 
of a radical 500day plan for transition to a market economy the 
official tass news agency said 
yavlinsky formally offered his resignation to the russian 
lawmakers on oct 17 after president mikhail s gorbachev 
presented an alternative plan that had no time limit lawmakers 
delayed a vote on yavlinskys resignation to give him time to 
reconsider 
tass said yavlinsky offered his resignation because the 
gorbachev plan was virtually under way nationwide and realization 
of the 500day program as yavlinsky put it was unrealistic 
russian president boris n yeltsin gorbachevs chief rival has 
moved ahead with the 500day plan in russia by far the largest of 
the soviet unions 15 republics 
today russian prime minister ivan silayev urged the republics 
lawmakers to accept yavlinskys resignation i do this with 
regret but yavlinsky wants to work in another capacity tass 
quoted silayev as saying 
deputies voted 164 to 17 to accept the resignation the 
independent news agency interfax reported 
yavlinskys resignation came a day after yeltsin declared that 
soviet republics could no longer wait for a union treaty to be 
approved he said they were proceeding on their own to create a new 
economic union 
yeltsin on wednesday signed a treaty with the republic of 
kazakstan the fourth bilateral treaty with another republic 
the treaty with the central asian republic would set up direct 
economic politial and cultural ties yeltsin signed a treaty with 
the ukraine on monday and earlier concluded pacts with moldavia and

the move by yeltsin gorbachevs main political rival indicated 
he was moving to consolidate support among the republics the two 
leaders have been locked in a power struggle over their divergent 
plans for rescuing the economy and holding the country together 
resulting in a paralysis of power 
these bilateral treaties could constitute a major solid 
foundation for the future signing of a new union treaty yeltsin 
said at a news conference after the signing at the same time he 
said they would help prevent economic chaos until such a treaty 
could be signed 
since nov 1 yeltsin and his government have gone ahead with 
their own 500day transition program drafted by a group of 
economists headed by yavlinsky and economist stanislav shatalin 
but legislators in the countrys largest republic have been 
stymied because they do not have clear control of prices currency 
interest rates land and real estate 
the national legislature the supreme soviet agreed oct 19 on 
a compromise economic plan endorsed by gorbachev that is a slower 
and less radical step away from central planning to a market 
economy

later when bush visited an army encampment capt michael 
stevens of miami said morale was generally high its great that 
he came it gives us all a sign that he cares 
bush then traveled toward the front lines of the persian gulf 
crisis for an appearance carried live in the united states on 
breakfasttime tv 
for security reasons the white house forbid publication of the 
presidents precise location but gen norman schwarzkopf 
commander of us forces said bush and his wife barbara would be 
within 80 miles of the border with iraqioccupied kuwait the 
president called it an unforgettable visit and left with a 
prayer in our hearts a prayer on our lips 
god bless you all god bless our faithful allies bush said 
bush was the first president to visit with us troops in the 
field since thenpresident richard m nixons july 1969 visit to 
south vietnam 
from his first stop in dhahran bush boarded a helicopter to 
visit troops at remote locations and to share thanksgiving dinner 
the military arranged to serve a holiday meal shrimp cocktail 
turkey stuffing mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce to all the 
american forces stationed around the gulf 
the bushes got a rousing welcome from a sunbaked crowd of 
several thousand troops at dhahran where he spoke from an airport 
platform in front of parked warplanes bush wearing khaki pants 
and an opencollar blue shirt waded into a sea of military 
personnel dressed in desert camouflage uniforms to shake hands and 
pose for pictures 
in a brief speech bush said the united states has acted with 
restraint as is our way against iraqi president saddam 
hussein but saddam is making the mistake of his life if he 
confuses an abundance of restraint and patience with a lack of 
resolve he said 
and every day that passes brings saddam hussein one step 
closer to realizing his goal of a nuclear weapons arsenal bush 
said and frankly thats another reason why more and more our 
mission is marked by a real sense of urgency 
it was a theme he struck again in his speech near the front 
american and israeli experts believe iraq is at least five to 10 
years away from building nuclear weapons but bush said no one 
should be certain of such a timetable 
no one knows precisely when this dictator may acquire atomic 
weapons or exactly who they may be aimed at down the road but we 
do know this for sure hes never possessed a weapon he didnt 
use bush said 
today was the first time bush has cited iraqs nuclear program 
as a major reason for confronting saddam the president had said 
wednesday he planned to tell us troops they were not in saudi 
arabia on some mission impossible

brent scowcrowft in an interview said bush was stressing the 
nuclear aspect as a message to those who urge longer waits to see 
if economic sanctions work and people who say wait a year two 
years 
if we had to use force after he had nuclear weapons it would 
be a whole different operation scowcroft said 
bush told the troops 
no president none at all is quick to order american troops 
abroad but there are times when all nations that value freedom 
must confront aggression 
sometimes its a question of some pain some pain now to 
avoid even worse pain later he said 
he met with members of the armys 197th infantary brigate 
located in fort benning ga and other assorted troops brought in 
sand was everywhere in the air and huge clouds billowed as bushs 
helicopter landed 
the president and his wife waited in a chow line to get the food 
in a tent covered with camouflage netting then joined the troops 
eating at tables that were no more than slabs of plywood placed 
atop sandbags soldiers leaned their m16 rifles up against their 
tables as they ate 
bush gave the troops a set of horsehoes which he said could be 
won in a drawing he said he and his sons would challenge the 
winner to play with them back at the white house horsehoe pits 
my boys and i can whup you he cautioned the yetunknown 
winner 
bush also choppered to the uss nassau a helicopter carrier in 
the gulf the final stop was at a forwardbased marine command post

margaret thatcher expressed shock and amazement at her decision 
thursday to resign although some said she had done the right 
thing 
the opposition labor party members said they were delighted 
conservative lawmaker peter thurnham turned up at mrs 
thatchers 10 downing street office with two dozen red roses for 
her 
in condolence a reporter asked 
yes thurnham replied bluntly 
more flowers turned up throughout the day from admirers around 
the country they included lilies seen as a symbol of a passing 
era mrs thatcher said she will step down as prime minister when a 
new party leader was chosen 
thank you for all you have done for our country said a 
message attached to one bunch 
kenneth baker conservative party chairman said i am very 
saddened indeed that our greatest peacetime prime minister has left 
government she is an outstanding leader not only of our country 
and the world and i do not believe we will see her like again 
labor party leader neil kinnock was cheerful following mrs 
thatchers announcement calling it good very good indeed 
i cannot pretend otherwise lets have a general election 
now said kinnock whose party has led recent public opinion 
polls 
paddy ashdown leader of the smaller opposition liberal 
democrats said the prime minister has taken the right decision 
for her own reputation for the unity of her party and for the 
good of britain 
i just cant believe it has happened said james spicer 
conservative vice chairman and a close friend of mrs thatcher 
he added in a reference to politicians who were dismissed or 
resigned from mrs thatchers government i dont know quite what 
the reaction will be worldwide i am sure it will be shock and 
amazement that someone of her caliber can have ended her career 
like this pulled down by a mixture of envy and dislike borne of 
being cast aside 
sir john stokes conservative party lawmaker said the party had 
thrown out its greatest leader 
the age of chivalry has gone and disloyalty has triumphed 
conservative lawmaker john hannam thought mrs thatcher had had 
a very good chance of winning the next round of voting in the 
partys process of choosing their leader 
but he conceded mrs thatcher had to consider whether she could 
carry on without the full backing of the partys 372 legislators 
fellow conservative neville trotter said i think she has done 
the right thing she has put the interests of the party first 
trotter said the leadership election would take place in a 
calmer cooler atmosphere now that mrs thatcher had resigned 
she will always be remembered as one of the greatest political 
leaders in our history said sir geoffrey howe a close colleague 
of mrs thatcher for 15 years 
but it was howes resignation as deputy prime minister on nov 1 
in protest at what he saw as mrs thatchers negative attitudes to 
european integration that was crucial in forcing the leadership 
contest 
on nov 14 former defense minister michael heseltine announced 
a formal challenge to mrs thatchers leadership he gathered 
enough votes tuesday to force mrs thatcher to a second ballot 
and he appeared to be picking up strength leading to mrs 
thatchers decision to resign 
a tribute to mrs thatcher had been written in the cabinet 
record for thursday 
it read in part we thank you most warmly for your leadership 
and we extend to both you and your husband retired oil executive 
denis thatcher who has supported you so marvelously all our best 
wishes for the future your place in our countrys history is 
already assured

prime minister poul schlueter today 
called early elections for dec 12 after his minority government 
failed to gain support in parliament for its economic program 
talks broke down late wednesday between schlueters centerright 
coalition and the main opposition social democrats on an economic 
package that included tax reform 
denmarks personal income taxes average around 52 percent and 
climb progressively to 68 percent the secondhighest in europe 
after sweden 
despite agreement on the need to cut taxes the political 
factions differ about how to fill the gap in state revenues left by 
a proposed tax break while staying within the governments tight 
1991 draft budget 
a total of 13 parties will be contesting seats in the 179seat 
legislature where schlueter commands only 67 votes the social 
democrats have 55 seats 
since his conservativeled government could not muster a 
majority in the folketing or parliament for its draft budget 
schlueter announced the election without the traditional debate 
some commentators questioned whether the ballot was really 
necessary a regular election is already scheduled for next year 
but schleuter said elections were needed now to give the 
government the authority to carry out tax reforms without further 
delay 
it is necessary to get it over with as quickly as possible 
he said in a short statement 
economy minister niels helveg petersen leader of the 
socialliberal party the junior coalition partner said he 
regretted the election call at a time when the two sides had 
narrowed their differences 
the coalition parties will campaign singly and together to 
gain the extra backing needed to carry out its economic package 
said petersen 
uffe ellemannjensen the foreign minister and leader of the 
liberal party the senior coalition partner welcomed the poll 
he said there were major differences in principle between the 
government and the social democrats on taxes and economic policy 
the government would continue to work for tax relief 
ellemannjensen said 
social democratic leader svend auken said the party would run on 
a platform of fuller employment environmental protection and tax 
breaks for middle income groups the jobless rate stands at 98 
percent 
auken criticized schlueter for wanting to give tax relief to the 
affluent while running up a 53 billion budget deficit 
the coalition parties conservatives liberals and social 
liberals had agreed with the social democrats on lowering income 
taxes at the top of the scale to bring them more into line with 
those of denmarks european community partners

emperor akihito today began the most controversial 
ceremony in his accession to the chrysanthemum throne a communion 
with the mythical sun goddess from whom legend says the imperial 
line descended 
the shinto rite has been performed by most of japans monarchs 
since at least the seventh century and in the past was believed to 
give monarchs their status as living gods 
but protests were held across the country against the 
statefunded rite which has been criticized by many japanese as 
violating the constitutions separation of church and state 
hundreds of scholars in the north and labor unionists in the 
west held peaceful demontrations while hundreds of christians 
nationwide fasted 
about 30000 police were assigned to security in tokyo alone 
because of the threat of violence by ultraleftist radicals who 
want to abolish the monarchy 
as the ceremony began this evening radicals fired six metal 
projectiles from homemade mortarlike launchers at an imperial 
villa in kyoto western japan police said 
radicals were believed responsible for a fire that destroyed a 
shinto shrine in southern japan today police said on wednesday 
antimonarchy radicals shoveled human waste from a truck near the 
imperial palace 
akihito 56 is the first japanese emperor to be enthroned not 
as a godking but as a symbol of his peoples sovereignty but that 
has not diminished the pomp and ceremony of his multimilliondollar 
coronation 
prime minister toshiki kaifu dressed in a swallowtailed coat 
arrived at the palace this evening to attend the communion one of 
the final events surrounding the enthronement nearly 900 japanese 
dignitaries were expected to attend 
unlike akihitos formal state enthronement ceremony nov 12 that 
was viewed by foreign dignitaries representing 158 countries no 
foreigners were invited to the communion which is to end before 
dawn friday 
during the rite called the daijosai or great food offering 
ritual akihito offers rice wine and other foods from around the 
country to the sun goddess amaterasu from whom legend says the 
imperial line descended 
only two female attendants clad in white and red kimono and 
with their hair tied in pony tails nearly 6 feet long witness the 
daijosai the ceremony is held in the torchlit inner sanctuary of 
a specially built hall on the palace grounds the rite is performed 
only once by each emperor 
akihito wearing his most holy white silk robes for the rite and 
surrounded by court chamberlains slowly proceeded to the 
sanctuary led by two attendants lighting the way with torches 
other attendants carried a large parasol over akihitos head or 
unrolled a rush mat before him yet another rolled up the mat 
behind the emperor after each deliberate step 
inside the sanctuary out of view of the 733 japanese guests 
seated in large tents nearby the offerings were to be made to an 
altar placed beside a stylized bed from which the goddess is 
summoned 
scholars before world war ii theorized that at one time the 
ceremony might have involved the emperor symbolically having sex 
with the sun goddess representing a union with the divine palace 
officials however deny that theory and said the emperor would not 
touch the bed 
after the first communion this evening the ceremony was to be 
repeated after midnight in an identical hall located just yards 
away from the first one haunting court music was to be played 
throughout 
akihito like his father the late emperor hirohito performs 
dozens of religious ceremonies at the palace each year carrying on 
the priestking role that has been handed down from ancient times 
that role however has periodically come under fire since the 
end of world war ii and opposition political parties christian 
organizations and other groups claim the government is violation 
the constitutional separation of church and state by spending an 
estimated 17 million on the coronation rites 
hirohito who died in january 1989 at age 87 renounced the 
concept of imperial divinity on new years day 1946 at the urging 
of the usled occupation forces the countrys postwar 
constitution specifies that the emperor is a national symbol and 
not a godking as tradition had had it 
critics say repeating the shinto rites for akihitos 
enthronement could encourage a return to the feverish 
emperorworship that helped lead the nation into war

prime minister margaret thatcher the iron 
lady to the end announced her resignation today after 11 years 
of power and then ordered more british troops to the persian 
gulf 
the startling news that britains first woman prime minister 
would call it quits came only one day after she had vowed i 
fight on i fight to win 
the seemingly indomitable mrs thatcher europes 
longestserving leader was driven out by a rebellion in the ranks 
of her conservative party which now faces a threeman race to 
succeed her 
the troop deployment was decided at the same cabinet meeting in 
which the prime minister was warned that she would lose to michael 
heseltine in the second round of the conservative party leadership 
election under britains parliamentary system the leader of the 
majority party is the prime minister 
the prime minister had been sinking in the polls amid 
dissatisfaction over tax policies and high inflation 
mrs thatcher had failed on tuesday to decisively fend off a 
challenge by the popular michael heseltine who resigned as her 
defense minister in 1986 in the first round of voting by 
conservative members of parliament 
i have concluded the unity of the party and prospects of 
victory in a general election would be better served if i stood 
down to enable cabinet colleagues to enter the ballot for the 
leadership mrs thatcher said in a statement released by her 
office 
foreign secretary douglas hurd and treasury chief john major 
released from the obligations of loyalty both jumped into the 
race saying they were joining in a friendly contest 
wearing a royal blue suit and pearls as she faced a packed house 
of commons on thursday mrs thatcher appeared calm and in command 
fielding a friendly question she said yes i do look back 
with some pride and some satisfaction at our achievements for our 
country over the last 11 years 
conservative lawmaker anthony marlow told her it was a time of 
sadness and happiness 
sadness for her from the great well of affection that exists 
for here in the house happiness in celebration of what has been 
is and will remain the greatest peacetime political reign of this 
century marlow said 
when opposition labor party leader neil kinnock pressed his 
demand for a national election mrs thatcher said that was no more 
in the cards than it was when labor prime minister harold wilson 
resigned in 1976 and was succeeded by james callaghan 
speaking in the house of commons defense secretary tom king 
said the new deployment in the persian gulf would involve 14000 
troops bringing the total number of british soldiers in saudi 
arabia to more than 30000 
that would make the british troop commmitment to the 
multinational forces arrayed against iraq in the gulf the 
secondlargest behind the united states which has deployed 250000 
soldiers and promised another 100000 
earlier mrs thatcher smiled but said nothing to reporters as 
she left her office to go to buckingham palace to inform queen 
elizabeth ii of her decision her office said her resignation would 
take effect as soon as her party has a new leader 
the announcement that mrs thatcher would resign came barely 2 
hours before the deadline for nominations in next tuesdays second 
round of voting only a simple majority will be needed to win 
mrs thatcher has been assailed for imposing a new per capita 
tax on local services that makes princes pay the same as paupers 
the dissatisfaction hit new heights several weeks ago when she 
resisted backing monetary union for the european community at a 
meeting of its leaders 
heseltine 57 has promised a more caring capitalism a 
review of the local services tax and closer ties to the 12nation 
european community 
labor had been leading the conservatives in the polls for 16 
months but several recent surveys showed the conservatives leading 
if heseltine were the leader 
heseltine won enough votes in the first round of balloting among 
the 372 conservative members of 650seat house of commons to deny 
mrs thatcher an outright victory and many observers saw that 
failure as tantamount to defeat 
labor leader neil kinnock hailed the news of his nemesis 
departure 
good very good indeed i cannot pretend otherwise kinnock 
said 
whoever becomes prime minister must call new parliamentary 
elections by mid1992 
mrs thatcher struggling to stay in power had rushed back on 
wednesday from a european summit in paris changed campaign 
managers and tried to hustle votes in the commons tearoom 
shares on the london stock exchange shot higher following the 
news mrs thatcher was withdrawing from the leadership challenge

here is a transcript of president 
bushs remarks at a us marine outpost thursday 
q off mike disproportionate share of the burden our troops 
outnumber the other forces here something like four to one 
president bush well were by far the largest country and also 
when youre the leader in the world for peace and for freedom you 
bear a disproportionate responsibility and were prepared to do 
that im pleased that 23 countries are involved im pleased that 
other forces are moving in i saw the desert rats here today 
and im very proud once again were shoulder to shoulder with the 
brits for example we have arab forces here but were the united 
states of america and we have a disproportionate responsibility to 
lead and to stand for something and thats what were doing and 
thats 
q speaking of the brits what is your reaction to margaret 
thatchers decision to resign 
president bush well of course you know of my high regard for 
prime minister thatcher and i we will obviously work with the 
next prim minister and i expect that knowing the fiber there that 
theyll stay right on course with us but on a very personal sense 
i would express my my send my best to her at this difficult 
time shes been a staunch friend and ally shes a woman of 
principle she stood for what she believes you always know where 
she was and what she believed and i think everybody in america 
would agree that margaret thatcher has been an outstanding ally for 
the united states and i you know am certain that this will 
continue with the united kingdom but on a personal basis ill 
miss her because i value her counsel i value her long experience 
that the wisdom that comes from her long experience and she has 
been an outstanding prime minister for the united kingdom and an 
outstanding friend of the united states 
q mr president what did you learn by walking in the same 
footsteps as the soldiers you sent 
president bush i learned a lot about the kids just from looking 
them in the eye and i learned once again something i already knew 
how lucky we are to have this all volunteer force as strong as 
well trained and as highly motivated as they are and i theyre 
just like my own kids probably wish they were home its 
thanksgiving day in the united states and i learned that theyre 
willing to be apart from their own loved ones because they feel it 
is their duty and their obligation 
q had you 
president bush and theyre strong and theyre tough and 
theyre i ive been very moved by today ill tell you 
q had you been concerned about the morale sir given the fact 
that its almost four months now and theyve had no nothing to 
fight 
president bush well i think the waiting is a difficult 
difficult part of this but i think they like their president 
would prefer a peaceful solution but like their president i sense 
a certain resolve on their part that if they have to do something 
theyre prepared to do it and they want to do it and do it fast 
and they want to do it and get it over and i can understand that 
i was in their shape fortysome years ago today fortysix and 
so i i ive been very moved and motivated myself by this and 
ill go the extra mile for peace weve been doing it weve been 
showing patience and restraint but i also know that this saddam 
hussein is cruel and hes brutal and hes violating the rights of 
individuals and i dont believe theres a marine out here or an 
army person or a navy person or an air force man or woman or a 
british rat or our arab allies that are not as upset as i am 
about the way innocent civilians are being treated and ill damn 
sure tell you im upset about it and well try the peaceful route 
were trying it but there will be no compromise with this kind of 
aggression were not going to compromise 
q sir you talked 
president bush thank you all 
q evasively today about a nuclear saddams nuclear 
capability 
president bush yes im concerned about that 
q whats behind this is 
president bush theres nothing behind it its just the fact 
that i think the longer it goes one why im concerned about it 
thats whats behind it 
q you have new information that its closer than you thought 
before 
q just i would just stay with what i said here today and i 
when i said that he is remember that hes used every weapon hes 
had im thinking primarily of the brutality of those chemical 
weapons that he did use on his own people and i hope the american 
people understand this more clearly now but i darn sure get the 
feeling that the people out here understand it thank you all 
q president bush this is an emotional day for you sir wasnt 
it 
president bush it was a very emotional day for me and i im 
i think we are very fortunate to have this kind of dedicated 
young man and young woman in the sands of saudi arabia today and 
its only the united states that can lead like this its only the 
united states of america and we have others with us but these are 
the ones that are doing the heavy lifting and god bless them all

president bush gave thanks with us troops in the saudi desert 
today and britain announced it was almost doubling the number of 
military personnel it has deployed in the persian gulf 
saddam hussein meanwhile released more than 100 european 
hostages today but american captives in iraq marked a thanksgiving 
full of fear and uncertainty 
secretary of state james a baker iii was in yemen seeking 
support for a un security council resolution authorizing force 
against iraq 
bush became the first us president to visit frontline troops 
since president richard m nixon made a 1969 trip to south vietnam 
what were confronting is a classic bully who thinks he can 
get away with kicking sand in the face of the world he told 
soldiers and airmen at an air force command center in dhahran 
britains defense secretary tom king said the new deployment in 
the persian gulf would involve 14000 troops bringing the total 
number of british military personnel in saudi arabia to more than 
30000 
that would make the british troop commmitment to the 
multinational forces arrayed against iraq in the gulf the 
secondlargest behind the united states which has deployed 250000 
soldiers and promised another 100000 
the european hostages mainly britons and swiss left baghdad 
today aboard two chartered planes saddam had freed them in reponse 
to appeals by french and swiss delegations 
one group of 83 left with rightwing french politician 
jeanmarie le pen for strasbourg france aboard an iraqi airways 
jetliner another 36 europeans left earlier aboard a chartered 
swissair jet for zurich with a fivemember swiss parliamentary 
delegation 
hundreds of americans are still held in iraq some of them 
detained as human shields at key installations twelve american 
captives were brought to a swank baghdad country club by iraqi 
authorities for a thanksgiving meal of turkey 
one of the hostages donald whitely 49 of shreveport la 
said he hoped he would be freed soon because his father was 
seriously ill and i want to see him before he dies 
some of the catives were reunited with members of their 
families who had flown to baghdad to see them against us 
government advice 
in germany chancellor helmut kohl called today for a peaceful 
resolution of the persian gulf crisis and said the time is 
ripe to solve the arabisraeli tensions and the lebanon conflict 
as well 
so far most western leaders have resisted linking efforts to 
peacefully resolve the crisis with the search for a solution to the 
palestinian question and lebanons more than 15yearold civil war 
the us buildup in the gulf region has led to a manpower 
squeeze in the military and there were reports today that the army 
has decided to halt retirements and discharges for the duration of 
the crisis 
the alliance that has gathered armies navies and air forces in 
the region in response to iraqs seizure of kuwait is enforcing a 
unordered trade embargo that aims to drive the iraqis out of 
kuwait 
but the embargo is widely thought by allied leaders to be slow 
in squeezing the iraqis bush lobbied hard during this weeks 
european security summit in paris for support for a un resolution 
authorizing military action to drive iraq out of kuwait 
in paris both soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and french 
president francois mitterrand on wednesday called for a un 
security council meeting to determine what further action should be 
taken against iraq 
baker has also pursued a resolution on the use of force in 
meetings over the past week with the foreign ministers of eight of 
the un security councils 15 members today he traveled to 
yemen which is the only arab member of the security council 
yemen has abstained in voting on about half of the 10 security 
council resolutions condemning iraq for grabbing kuwait 
un officials say the bush administration wants a vote on the 
military strike resolution next week because it holds the security 
councils rotating presidency this month and must cede it to yemen 
in december 
in eastern saudi arabia bush and his wife barbara got a rousing 
welcome from several thousand troops 
he told the troops the united states has acted with restraint 
against iraq so far but warned saddam is making the mistake of 
his life if he confuses an abundance of restraint and patience with 
a lack of resolve 
in his speech bush for the first time cited iraqs nuclear 
program as a major reason for confronting saddam 
american and israeli experts believe iraq is five to 10 years 
away from building nuclear weapons even so the president said 
every day that passes brings saddam hussein one step closer to 
realizing his goal of a nuclear weapons arsenal

what do you do with 1000 pounds of 
raspberry goo if youre smart youll put it in a tart and not 
down a storm drain hoping itll be washed away by a good rain 
evan d hansen was fined 500 for dumping the dessert raspberry 
gelatin and whipped cream down a storm drain violating the 
states water pollution control act 
hansen was faced with the dessert dilemma following a sept 5 
contest in which participants attempted to perform the most 
outrageous stunts to win 5000 from a local radio station 
hansen won by cutting the roof from a station wagon filling it 
with raspberry gelatin and topping it with whipped cream he then 
dressed in a white tuxedo jumped in the gelatin and drove the car 
across the parking lot 
problems occurred when he tried to get rid of the goo hansen 
said he hired a waste disposal company to remove the gelatin from 
his car but their pump clogged so he dumped it into a storm drain 
which empties into big cottonwood creek 
i knew t was biodegradable and figured the rain would take 
care of it said hansen im sure there was absolutely no 
damage 
kent miner director of water quality and hazardous waste for 
the salt lake citycounty health department said the environmental 
consequences of the illegal discharge were minor but the law 
mandates a fine for the unauthorized release of wastes into a 
stream

as proud family members watched 154 new 
prison guards graduated from the state correctional academy but 
then they were promptly told by their boss that theyre being laid 
off 
the hard part is six weeks ago these guys gave up jobs to work 
for me and now theyre on the street state corrections 
commissioner thomas coughlin said wednesday after the ceremony 
coughlin told the new guards who come from across new york 
that theyll lose their jobs the day after christmas thats when 
they will have completed their four weeks of onthejob training at 
various state prisons 
under state contracts with their employees it is required that 
the newest employees are laid off first 
the layoffs from the 21000ayear rookie guard jobs are part 
of gov mario cuomos plan to reduce a potential 1 billion budget 
deficit this year with 2000 state agency firings 
in all coughlin has to lay off about 300 guards and 400 
teachers and other civilian prison employees as part of the cuomo 
plan 
these poor folks through no fault of their own got caught up 
in the cuts coughlin said they had to go 
about 400 people including family members of the new guards 
listened silently to the commissioners comments at the start of 
the ceremony said coughlin 
there was so much anxiety in the room coughlin said of the 
fact that last saturday it was announced that 300 guards would be 
laid off they probably saw the handwriting on the wall 
theres a good chance the fired guards will be rehired as other 
guards quit or retire and the state opens new prisons coughlin 
said

for five years david sundstrom has tried to 
sell utilities on a system that turns coal into cleanerburning gas 
and produces electricity with less pollution 
usually they would listen he says and then sit on their 
hands 
no more 
utility executives now are seeking out sundstroms company 
destec energy inc and trekking in steady numbers to the dow 
chemical co subsidiarys coal gasification demonstration plant in 
louisiana to learn more 
there is now a line outside the door there will be plenty of 
business for destec says charles goff the companys president 
its oneman sales force is being expanded 
the smiles at destec and at hundreds of environmental services 
companies like it nationwide stem from the 1990 clean air act 
signed into law by president bush on nov 15 marking a new era in 
air pollution controls 
the tougher clean air requirements that will be phased in over 
the next dozen years are expected to cost polluters and their 
customers as much as 11 billion a year within five years and 
more than 25 billion a year by the 2005 thats money that will be 
going into someone elses pocketbook 
destec hopes to capture a large chunk of the money 
so do lowsulfur coal producers manufactures of auto emissions 
equipment builders of 100 million scrubbers for power plants 
designers of pollution monitoring gear brokers in pollution 
allowances and droves of lawyers and consultants needed to make 
sense of the dozens of new government regulations yet to come 
the environmental protection agency also is hiring people to 
help develop and implement the regulations 
there are going to be an awful lot of people that will be big 
winners says bruce braine a vice president of icf resources 
inc an environmental consulting firm in fairfax va 
the new clean air law will require tougher emissions controls on 
automobiles force factories and thousands of businesses to install 
new pollution control equipment and require that electric 
utilities cut in half releases of sulfur dioxide that cause acid 
rain 
electric rate payers will see higher bills especially in parts 
of the midwest car prices likely will go up as will gasoline and 
possibly other products 
the acid rain requirements will force utilities to buy expensive 
pollution control equipment or shift away from highsulfur coal 
that has people smiling at the at massey coal co in richmond 
va the biggest producer of lowsulfur coal in the east where 
tshirts have begun to sprout declaring massey lite coal high 
in btus low in sulfur 
were trying to give massey an identity says jerry eyster 
vice president for corporate development he predicts competition 
will still be keen with western lowsulfur coal producers 
thats fine with the burlington northern railroad one of the 
major shippers of lowsulfur coal out of wyomings powder river 
basin the railroad has begun test runs of coal shipments farther 
east than normal and anticipates that the clean air requirements 
will boost volume by 10 percent 
a key and innovative part of the new law will allow utilities to 
trade pollution allowances to ease the cost of compliance that has 
telephones ringing in the washington office of aerx a company that 
specializes in such trades 
clearly were going to be a winner says john palmisano 
president and founder of the firm were hiring we look at 1991 
as a good year and 1992 as a very good year 
the natural gas industry also sees dollar signs industrial 
plants and electric utilities will eye the cleaner fuel as will 
fleet vehicle operators in the nations smogclogged cities 
pacific gas amp electric co in california hopes to capitalize with 
plans to develop a network of outlets dispensing natural gas for 
fleet vehicles and eventually private cars 
at tecogen inc in waltham mass the clean air bill means a 
major marketing boost for a new engine that uses compressed natural 
gas the company already has an agreement to supply 10 of the 
engines for school buses as part of a pilot program in california 
but now expects interest to jump 
ravinder sakhuja tecogens president said the company is 
expected to triple its revenue from the current 20 million a year 
within four or five years because of new business 
companies like alliedsignal automotive catalyst co in tulsa 
okla also expect business to prosper as automakers will demand 
more sophisticated emissions control equipment the rampd people 
the engineering people those people are winners said jim hiera 
the companys director of marketing 
the required sale of cleanerburning gasoline in cities with the 
worst smog will increase gasoline costs in 1995 some of the money 
will go to archerdanielmidland co which produces ethanol a 
cornbased additive as well as to farmers 
natec resources inc in houston is pushing a process in which 
baking soda would be used to chemically transform sulfur dioxide at 
coalburning power plants into sodium sulfate that can be used in 
laundry detergent 
paul portney vice president of resources for the future a

despite growing opposition to the plan 
this country that has traditionally sheltered east bloc refugees is 
preparing to send home 7000 romanians in its largest forced 
repatriation in decades 
i cannot keep everyone happy interior minister franz 
loeschnak said wednesday of the burgeoning criticism from 
newspapers politicians and the roman catholic church 
on thursday protestant church leaders also announced their 
opposition about 80 people gathered this afternoon near an 
antifascist memorial to peacefully protest the government plan 
more than 11000 romanians have fled their troubled homeland 
this year alone by far the largest nationality among more than 
18000 asylumseekers who have arrived in austria in 1990 
the government has refused to say when the first romanians would 
be ejected but a source who asked not to be more closely 
identified said the process was tentatively scheduled to begin 
this month 
about 60 romanians who have been convicted of crimes in austria 
will be the first to go home he said romanians whose asylum 
requests had been refused and those without jobs or permanent 
residence will also be forced to leave loeschnak told austrian 
radio 
loeschnak said that about 1200 romanian refugees had already 
been singled out and aides confirmed plans to send about 7000 
back once all the paperwork is completed 
most have been living in governmentfunded refugee camps or 
rooms 
historians say the ejections would be the countrys largest 
since thousands of refugees were forcibly relocated after world war 
ii by the four victorious powers who occupied austria until 1955 
with the toppling of communist regimes in eastern europe the 
refugee issue has grown in importance in austria which offered 
haven for decades to the politically persecuted from the other side 
of the iron curtain 
hundreds of thousands of hungarians were welcomed in 1956 after 
soviet tanks crushed their uprising more than 100000 
czechoslovaks gained free entry in 1968 following the warsaw pact 
invasion of their country 
no one was sent back against his will during the four decades of 
communism in eastern europe 
but sentiment has changed in the past year as east europeans 
flood through newly opened borders most to visit some to stay 
romanians have been the target of most of the enmity while most 
other east europeans appear content to visit and return home 
romanians have continued to flee economic malaise and political 
uncertainty unmatched in most of the other former soviet bloc 
nations 
of the 18603 people who sought asylum up to september 11038 
were romanian according to interior ministry figures turks were 
the next largest group at 1478 
the influx has overwhelmed many austrians used to a more quiet 
life many now say that with the repressive communist regimes just 
a memory most of those seeking to stay in austria only want a 
higher standard of living 
im afraid to go shopping on mariahilferstrasse nowadays 
said jo mestitz an 84year old widow who lives near the broad 
shopping street in viennas sixth district youre likely to get 
overrun by poles and all you hear spoken is czech or hungarian 
originally only refugee aid organizations objected to the 
governments plan but by wednesday criticism had grown to include 
political figures from the partners in the governing coalition and 
roman catholic bishops who have the ear of more than 80 percent of 
the nations 76 million people 
mass deportations of people have never been justified because 
each individuals fate is different from someone elses said 
bishop florian kuntner president of the bishops commission for 
justice and peace 
stateowned austrian airlines announced it would not fly any 
romanian back home against his will and it urged the interior 
ministry to reconsider austrian radio said negotiations had been 
started with lauda air the nations private international airline 
many newspapers denounced the plan in stinging editorials 
it is bad that a minister of an austrian government has 
received such a task and it is bad that he accepts it without 
regard to human rights and humanity said the neue zeit 
newspaper 
it indirectly compared the plan to the deportations of jews to 
the auschwitz death camp in nazioccupied poland during world war 
ii 
but interior ministry spokesman rainer mayerhofer said most 
austrians supported the move

anticommunist organizations set up in the 1950s to counter a 
possible soviet invasion of western europe 
in a resolution passed by a vote of 6541 with 13 abstentions

investigation into the nature structure aims and all other 
aspects of these clandestine organizations

to carry out sabotage and surveillance in case of a soviet 
invasion

caches of weapons according to recent disclosures by west european 
officials

gladio after its italian code name was involved in rightwing 
terrorism during the 1970s especially in italy 
the parliament the european communitys assembly condemned the 
network which it said had escaped all democratic control some 
government leaders said they knew nothing about the clandestine 
groups in their countries

remaining clandestine military and paramilitary networks 
the assembly urged ec governments to examine the networks 
composition and modus operandi and to clarify any action they may 
have taken to destabilize the democratic structures of the ec 
member states 
the resolution singled out the united states for special 
criticism protesting vigorously against the efforts of us 
officials to encourage the establishment in europe of such a 
network 
some christian democrats in the parliament voted against the 
resolution to avoid criticizing members of their party in power in 
many west european countries when such networks were set up

for almost a decade margaret thatcher was 
regarded at the white house as americas best friend the trusted 
ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of 
administration policies 
among western allies she was alone at ronald reagans side in 
1986 in supporting the us bombing of libya in the persian gulf 
crisis she boldly joined with george bush in sending troops to the 
middle east 
you always know where she was and what she believed bush 
said upon hearing of her decision to resign she has always been 
an outstanding ally of the united states he said i will miss 
her 
there were many doubters around the world when reagan arrived in 
washington with an economic program of freemarket capitalism that 
seemed out of step with the times mrs thatcher wasnt one of the 
skeptics she was advocating a similar program at home 
they shared rocky relations with organized labor reagan 
successfully fired the nations air traffic controllers dealing a 
devastating blow to labor she too smashed restive unions 
on foreign policy she frequently was more right wing than 
reagan certainly more so than bush 
reagan never made any secret of his special affection for the 
british prime minister they were ideological soulmates and called 
each other ronnie and margaret at international gatherings they 
usually were side by side 
two years ago as they met for the final time before reagan left 
office the president said he was leaving the white house with 
considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that margaret thatcher 
will still reside at no 10 downing street 
she later wrote him a dear ron letter in which she praised 
him as a great president one of the greatest 
like reagan she was deeply suspicious of the soviet union 
together they advocated a hard line toward moscow and championed 
military readiness even though she was the first to recognize 
mikhail s gorbachev as a leader she could do business with 
mrs thatcher encouraged the huge pentagon buildup that reagan 
nurtured under the theme of peace through strength she was a big 
backer of us efforts to install mediumrange missiles in europe 
and always seemed cautious perhaps reluctant when it came to 
disarmament 
when argentina and britain clashed militarily over the falkland 
islands the united states was forced to make a painful choice 
between two allies ronnie sided with margaret 
washingtons special relationship with london seemed to slip 
when reagan left power bush and mrs thatcher disagreed publicly 
last year over her governments decision to deport vietnamese and 
cambodian boat people who were fleeing their countries to hong 
kong 
bush a veteran of world politics knew many leaders around the 
globe mrs thatcher suddenly seemed to be just one of the gang 
the berlin wall was collapsing and it appeared as if bush found 
german chancellor helmut kohl more interesting than mrs thatcher 
she was merely one in a parade of foreign dignitaries who got the 
prized invitation to visit bush at camp david this year 
nevertheless bush said he expected the special relationship 
between the united states and great britain to remain on a steady 
keel 
mrs thatcher did her part demonstrating her loyalty for 
awhile she and bush were seemingly alone in their suspicions of 
gorbachevs unilateral cutbacks in troops and arms in europe and 
appeared uncertain how to respond 
under intense pressure from congress bush began to warm to the 
soviet leader now they seem almost best of friends 
on the persian gulf bush said he would not rule out possible 
military force and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make his 
threat credible mrs thatcher characteristically was tougher 
she said that unless saddam hussein got out of kuwait soon the 
west would have to use military force to dislodge him 
she called saddam a loser and the statecontrolled iraqi 
news agency replied that she was an old hag 
now she is leaving no one suspects that britains new 
leadership whoever it is will take a soft line toward iraq 
yet if the going gets tough it might have been comforting for 
bush to be able to hear the tough old line from thatcher

on the streets of central london britons were 
suprised and even shocked at prime minister margaret thatchers 
abrupt resignation thursday 
some people cheered and some were saddened 
but young or old male or female white collar or blue nearly 
everyone expressed surprise that the woman who is as much a british 
institution as the corner pub was suddenly gone 
it was quite a shock i suppose i didnt think she would 
quit all i could think when i saw the newswoman announcing it on 
tv this morning was that this was truly a historic day said 
christine scott 49 a school administrator on her way to lunch on 
fleet street 
the prime ministers resignation filled radio and tv airwaves 
throughout the day but many people first heard the news on their 
way to work 
i was on the elevator in the hampstead tube station when a 
woman came dashing on and said thats it maggies gone she 
resigned and everyone cheered they also read an announcement on 
the loudspeaker in the underground said elizabeth gore acting 
head of the language department at the city literary university in 
bolton court 
bus company inspectors hopped on the citys red doubledecker 
buses to announce the resignation the pilot of a british airways 
flight from paris to london relayed the news from the control tower 
at heathrow airport to passengers 
im very sad said sonya davis a manager at british 
telecom waiting for a friend outside the temple tube station at 
least she knew what she was doing i thought shed stay for a 
fight its a bit daunting to know she has given up 
some people worried that without mrs thatcher no one was 
guiding the ship of state through the turbulent waters of the 
persian gulf 
the only person happy today is saddam hussein said charles 
lord a 60yearold clerk at the bank of england 
behind the old bailey several young lawyers said they were more 
than ready for a change 
im very pleased its great somebody else will now have a 
chance and thats very good for the country said angus charlton 
a 25yearold lawyer in a savile row suit now the tories have to 
reunify to paper over the cracks that this leadership fight has 
created 
many of those happy to see her go expressed a tinge of regret 
its a shame really because she did lots of good things 
said michael davies a 27yearold taxi driver but in the last 
couple of years she has just gone too far 
davies like many other people listed the poll tax as a major 
cause of mrs thatchers decline in popular support 
theres no way to alienate a person faster than taking money 
out of his pocket davies said theres the poll tax thats 
what will kill the tories she also dismantled the national health 
so i now have to buy private health insurance 
between one thing and another she has cost me a couple of 
thousand quid pounds this year and thats a lot of money for a 
working person 
the poll tax replaces a tax on property owners and is paid by 
every adult 
davies said he liked michael heseltine the former defense 
minister who challenged mrs thatcher for the party leadership and 
garnered enough support on tuesday to precipitate her resignation 
none of the dozen people interviewed expressed much liking for 
the two men who entered the race after mrs thatcher resigned 
foreign secretary douglas hurd or chancellor of the exchequer john 
major 
one of the things i liked about maggie was that you felt she 
could cope with anyone and anything in the world she could stand 
up to anybody said mrs scott 
i dont feel that way about any of the others now that shes 
gone where do we find a leader 
claude musselwhite a retired businessman walking near 
westminster abbey said that while he felt sad it was probably 
time still there has never been anyone like her and there may 
never be again

a total of 279 iraqi prisoners of war 
released by iran arrived in baghdad on thursday the official iraqi 
news agency reported 
their arrival followed the release by iraq and return to tehran 
the previous day of 238 iranian pows 
this was the first exchange between the two countries in nearly 
two months 
the exchanges started in midaugust after iraqi president saddam 
hussein abruptly agreed to all irans conditions for a peace treaty 
to formally end the 198088 war between them 
he was apparently seeking peace on his eastern border while 
trying to consolidate his hold on the oilrich arab emirate of 
kuwait which he invaded on aug 2 
the prisoner exchanges were suspended by iraq without 
explanation sept 20 after 37000 men had been repatriated the 
international committee of the red cross said 25000 men remained 
interned without giving a breakdown 
the exchange started again following last weeks visit to 
baghdad by iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati he was the 
highest iranian official to visit iraq since irans 1979 islamic 
revolution

iraq is on a crash program to become the first 
arab state to have nuclear weapons but experts differ on how close 
the iraqi arsenal is to being ready 
president bush told us troops in saudi arabia thursday their 
mission was marked by a real sense of urgency because of 
president saddam husseins progress in acquiring nuclear arms but 
he added no one knows precisely how near iraq is to becoming a 
nuclear power 
some analysts in israel which tracks the iraqi program very 
closely estimate saddam is two to five years away from producing 
atomic warheads for his extensive missile stockpiles or building a 
nuclear bomb he can drop from a fighter jet 
other experts put the timetable at 10 years away especially if 
the program has been set back because of the international trade 
embargo against iraq 
iraq could have a nuclear weapons production capability within 
10 years said mike eisenstadt author of a report on iraqs 
nuclear chemical and biological capabilities issued recently by 
the washington institute for near east policy 
if it receives help from abroad it could be producing 
nuclear weapons within as little as five years said eisenstadt 
who also serves as a civilian analyst for us army intelligence 
the iraqi program got its start with help from france which 
sold two nuclear reactors to baghdad in 1976 for the production of 
electricity 
but israel citing intelligence information said iraq was using 
the reactors to produce nuclear weapons with the help of 150 pounds 
of enriched uranium supplied by france 
the substance is essential for exploding nuclear weapons and 
israel has reportedly obtained sufficient amounts to produce its 
own nuclear arsenal 
in 1981 israeli fighter planes bombed the iraqi nuclear 
facility outside baghdad israel drew international condemnation 
but the iraqi program was brought to a standstill 
the enriched uranium that was left over from the french shipment 
estimated at about 27 pounds was placed under the safeguards 
program of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty of which iraq is a 
signatory 
that means inspectors from the viennabased international atomic 
energy agency periodically inspect the material to make sure iraq 
isnt diverting it for weapons production 
the next inspection is scheduled next week and although the 
results generally remain classified us experts have said iraqs 
willingness to allow the inspection indicates it has not diverted 
the material 
nonetheless state department officials say iraq could have 
acquired other uranium which is not under the inspection program 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s according to eisenstadts 
report iraq acquired 250 tons of uranium ore concentrate from 
brazil portugal and niger this material is not weaponsgrade but 
could have been used to extract plutonium another essential 
component in a nuclear weapon said eisenstadt 
in 1987 iraq revived its nuclear program experts say 
rather than rebuilding the bombed reactor iraq decided to 
acquire a gas centrifuge device for enriching uranium according to 
experts and press reports brazil and pakistan both burgeoning 
nuclear powers have reportedly used this method successfully but 
it took each of them about a decade to have operational 
centrifuges 
iraq could use the uranium ore concentrate which is not subject 
to iaea inspection to power the centrifuge which produces enriched 
uranium experts say 
work on the iraqi project is reportedly being conducted at the 
saad 16 facility near the city of mosul at another site in a 
mountain near irbil and at the tuwaitha nuclear center outside 
baghdad 
west german firms taking advantage of their countrys formerly 
loose export restriction laws were instrumental in helping iraqs 
gas centrifuge project so were china pakistan and 
inadvertently several american and british firms 
last year us customs agents seized vacuum pumps bound for 
iraq from a rochester ny company saying the iraqis could have 
used them in their nuclear program 
british customs agents acting on a tip from us officials 
earlier this year seized a shipment of krytons to iraq krytons are 
used to detonate nuclear weapons 
after the seizure saddam announced his country could produce 
the devices on its own 
in addition to the concentrate uranium known as yellowcake 
iraq may also be trying to extract the metal from a mine in the 
northern part of the country 
recent soviet satellite pictures have found an industrial 
operation including new roads and two excavation sites in the 
gara mountains 40 miles south of the turkish border according to 
the respected janes defense weekly

christmas tree growers are trying to 
capitalize on americas newfound environmental awareness touting 
their evergreens as the responsible alternative to plastic 
petrochemical trees 
real trees are recyclable theyre biodegradable said 
jeanne weiss assistant director of public relations for the 
national christmas tree association in milwaukee 
plastic trees are made out of oil byproducts weiss said 
tuesday 
on the other hand some environmentalists point out that 
chemicals often are used on real trees and that plastic trees at 
least are reusable 
artificial trees for several years have held a steady 50 percent 
share of the holiday market even so weiss forecasts shoppers will 
buy 36 million cut christmas trees this season a 341 million 
business for wholesalers 
michigan the nations largest commercial tree producer will 
cut about 7 million trees this year 
in 1988 the national christmas tree growers group put 1 
million into a television advertising campaign playing on the 
nostalgic charm of cut trees this year weiss said with all 
that publicity about earth day we thought that should carry over 
to christmas 
the environmental tactic is part defense weiss said she often 
sees comments such as buy an artificial tree and save a real 
tree 
that is not what we want to see said weiss 
the association has an armory of christmas tree trivia for its 
campaign 
for every tree cut three are planted most on land where other 
crops fail 
most trees sold in the united states are grown here while 
artificial trees come from places like hong kong or taiwan 
the nations approximately 1 million acres of christmas trees 
supply enough oxygen for 18 million people those trees also absorb 
carbon dioxide one of the gases warming the earth through the 
greenhouse effect 
but a real christmas tree doesnt necessarily mean an 
environmentally safe tree said jane elder midwest representative 
for the sierra club in madison wis 
she said christmas tree buyers should be aware that most live 
trees are sprayed with a variety of chemicals even paint 
there are questions they should ask was it grown with 
herbicides or pesticides or sprayed with dyes or other chemical 
additives that will add to the pollution stream you get into 
the question of is it worth it for a tree that is just slightly 
more emerald green she said 
buyers should also consider how theyll dispose of the tree 
elder said 
if you are going to buy a petrochemical christmas tree and 
keep it for your lifetime and pass it down to your grandchildren 
then i suppose that too is environmentally sound she said 
pesticides and other chemicals are as much a part of the 
christmas tree industry as other agricultural products said 
michael gabrione general manager of m walter christmas trees 
inc in chicago the company has christmas tree farms from 
michigan to nova scotia and ships trees across the country 
if we have to have totally organic christmas trees everybody 
in the christmas tree industry is going to be in big trouble 
gabrione said people arent going to get the same kind of 
product they are used to 
walter christmas trees follows industry practice and paints its 
scotch pines green otherwise the trees would have a yellowish 
cast and gabrione said people expect a christmastree green 
color 
the paint also helps the tree retain moisture after its cut 
weiss couldnt say what chemicals are commonly used by christmas 
tree growers neither could laurie dornbush executive director of 
the michigan christmas tree association 
its something we want to look at dornbush said tuesday 
from her office in okemos 
shes interested in finding out what kind of chemical residues 
are left on trees by the time they wind up in living rooms or as 
garden mulch

a band of white and black 
rebel army troops mounted a failed coup attempt today in the black 
homeland of transkei and 17 people died in the fighting with 
loyalist forces reports said 
military ruler maj gen bantu holomisa told a rally late 
thursday in transkeis capital umtata that the coup attempt had 
been put down the independent south african press association 
reported holomisa said the leader of the uprising former holomisa 
aide craig duli was dead the agency said 
there was no independent confirmation of the report telephone 
lines to transkei were cut later in the afternoon and there was no 
answer at the transkei embassy in pretoria 
holomisa said the coup attempt was headed by duli a former 
member of the military council and involved about six whites and a 
handful of black troops duli is black and had been holomisas 
chief of military intelligence 
holomisa whose government has ties with the antiapartheid 
african national congress said earlier that he suspected the south 
african government might have been involved in the coup attempt 
south african foreign minister pik botha denied any south 
african effort to topple the government in the homeland of 275 
million people which covers three areas scattered in southeastern 
south africa 
homomisa said in addition to duli 11 coconspirators died in 
battles with government soldiers who surrounded the building in 
umtata where the rebels had taken refuge the press agency said 
five government soldiers were also killed 
earlier south african diplomats in umtata said fighting broke 
out about dawn when the rebels tried to seize key government 
buildings in the city umtata is about 370 miles south of 
johannesburg

base on the outskirts of umtata and the rebels later attempted to 
seize government buildings in the city

of umtata said south african diplomat gert terblanche reached 
by telephone in umtata diplomats said roadblocks were put up 
across the city

under heavy mortar fire terrified civilians tried to leave parts 
of umtata to escape fighting according to reports from transkei 
holomisa and the army seized power in transkei in 1987 and set 
up a government that has ties with the anc the main black 
opposition group in south africa 
duli helped holomisa seized power but the two had a falling out 
later and duli had been imprisoned until recently on charges of 
possessing weapons the transkei military had a few white officers 
when it was set up 
it is one of four nominally independent black homelands set up 
by the south afican government in the 1970s and 1980s as part of a 
plan to create separate states for blacks under the apartheid 
system of racial separation 
no country other than south africa recognizes the independent

the hollywood high school marching band once 
so bad the chamber of commerce banned it from playing in the 
hollywood christmas parade returns this year with snappy new 
uniforms and renewed spirit 
on sunday the band will join other bands floats and performers 
in the 1990 parade after an eightyear absence 
it has been a long road back to respectability for the band 
which at one point lacked enough members to form the h in 
hollywood 
this is going to be our crowning glory said band director 
joe montgomery two years ago we had seven people 
the band now boasts 99 members although only 50 will 
participate in the parade for all its progress the band has only 
enough redwhiteandsilver uniforms to outfit half of its members 
the band has not played in the parade since 1982 the hollywood 
chamber of commerce which sponsors the event said the band failed 
to measure up to parade standards 
the schools exclusion from the parade had been a source of 
embarrassment for decades the band traditionally led the parade 
eighty percent of hollywood highs 2000 students are immigrants 
who struggle with english and work after school to help support 
their families 
they had so many ethnic groups no one wanted to play an 
instrument all they wanted to do was study said parade 
chairman john golden 
montgomery was undaunted by the diversity and language barriers 
when he took over as director three years ago he quickly began 
recruiting musicians 
among those marching in the parade sunday will be a chinese 
trumpet player a vietnamese drummer a hungarian drum majorette 
an armenian bell player and a salvadoran saxophonist 
montgomery said the band has no intention of resting on its 
laurels 
next year he said we would like to lead the parade

there is no evidence of widespread hunger in 
the soviet union one of the worlds biggest grain growers and a 
food aid program shouldnt be necessary this year us officials 
say 
they produce an awful lot of meat and potatoes one analyst 
said 
germany already has pledged food aid to the soviets and 
president bush said in paris this week he would want to try to 
helpif theres a real need there canada italy and spain all 
have extended bank credits and in some cases pledges of other 
assistance to help the beleaguered gorbachev government 
the united states and other western countries may join forces to 
feed the soviet people if starvation appears imminent but us 
specialists in soviet agriculture economic and political affairs 
said in interviews this week there is no evidence at this point of 
genuine need 
food aid shouldnt be necessary this year said one highly 
placed state department official who discussed the situation on 
condition he not be identified the countryside appears to have 
food the agricultural regions of the soviet union and the cities 
in those regions appear to have food moscow and leningrad while 
obviously not an overflowing cornucopia have food 
the grain harvest was exceptionally good this year milk 
production is at record levels and meat could exceed last years 
levels potato output is down but not to a critical point 
there is a problem for those on fixed incomes who cannot 
supplement their diets by shopping every so often at the rinok 
or private farmers market the official said but basically 
even those people are getting along we dont have any evidence of 
significant or widespread hunger imminent starvation or anything 
like that 
john hardt a soviet affairs analyst with the library of 
congress said the key to any assistance program should be setting 
conditions and imposing discipline to ensure that the soviets 
implement the transition to a market system that gorbachev has 
promised 
experts say the soviet union alone can solve the main problem a 
distribution system unable to deliver food to those in need 
british prime minister margaret thatcher likened a soviet aid 
program to pouring money down a hole 
clearly its mostly a political consideration not a 
nutritional or an economic consideration one us source said 
the germans offering food aid put some pressure on the rest of us 
to show the same kind of concern but its exasperating because 
its their the soviets problem to solve and theyre not taking 
the necessary steps 
the us administrations political concerns were evident in 
bushs remarks in paris where he joined gorbachev and the leaders 
of 32 other nations to formally put an end to the cold war 
we would always be openminded on humanitarian aid if theres 
a real need there the american president said adding we want 
to try to help with the evolution of market systems and the 
evolution the change thats taking place and you also want to 
help new friends when you find them if theyre in jeopardy 
us officials expect critical shortages to show up first in 
heavily industrialized cities in the urals where food production 
was actively discouraged for decades and in the far north where 
farming is limited by the frigid climate those areas as well as 
the largest and onceprivileged cities of moscow and leningrad are 
most dependent on a distribution system that notoriously wasteful 
in the best of times is now collapsing 
collective and state farms and authorities in agricultural 
regions simply refuse to honor stateimposed contracts that require 
them to sell a certain amount of their products to the allunion 
fund for distribution to other parts of the country 
the soviets did increase wholesale food prices in september and 
october in an attempt to restock the allunion fund and provide 
commodities for the cities us observers say the move had some 
impact but was offset by the precipitous decline in the value of 
the ruble and the determination of farms and local officials to 
horde products for themselves or trade them directly for consumer 
goods 
as a result moscow which under the old system always enjoyed 
the best of what was available because it was the center of 
political power and influence is now in worse shape than many 
other areas 
but an experienced state department official said i 
personally find it difficult to believe the american taxpayer would 
support substantial amounts of food assistance to a country that 
just had the greatest bumper crop in history and which exports food 
to other countries unless theres really starvation 
the soviet union not only sells some food abroad the official 
noted but gives food relief aid to ethiopia 
asked if a relief program would serve the secondary goal of 
shoring up the gorbachev government the official said if it 
comes to providing us assistance it will be when things have 
reached a dire state of affairs and in that situation its 
difficult to believe there will still be much of a soviet 
government left to worry about 
in 1921 when famine and civil war swept the fledgling communist 
state the united states launched an ambitious program to relieve 
the disaster that eventually killed an estimated 3 million people 
we ran soup kitchens we had an elaborate distribution scheme 
we took food in trucks in donkey carts in horsedrawn carts dog 
sleds whatever it took to reach starving people the official 
said we might not do something that elaborate this time but we 
should take steps to make sure the food gets to the people who 
really need it

secretary of state james a baker iii was 
rebuffed thursday in efforts to get yemen the only arab nation on 
the un security council to support a resolution authorizing the 
use of force to oust iraq from kuwait 
yemens president gen ali abdullah saleh standing next to 
baker criticized the military buildup in the region and called for 
an arab solution to the crisis 
of course we dont support the presence of foreign forces in 
the region he said at the end of two hours of talks with baker 
at his residence in the yemeni capital of sana 
saleh said the foreign troops have complicated the problem 
rather than solved it 
baker was the highest ranking american official to visit yemen 
since president bush made a trip in 1986 when he was vice 
president 
he flew to sana from jiddah saudi arabia where bush was 
spending thanksgiving with some of the 230000 american servicemen 
in the region 
yemen a poor country on the southwestern tip of the arabian 
peninsula has gained prominence in the gulf crisis because of its 
current seat on the un security council 
in december it will assume the councils presidency now held 
by the united states 
any resolution giving advance authority to use military force 
against iraq would have to be approved by the 15nation security 
council 
saleh when asked whether he would support such a statement was 
interrupted by his foreign minister abdulkarim aliryani who 
said there is no resolution 
a state department official asked later about the yemeni 
position replied they didnt say no 
yemen has abstained from voting on five of the 10 resolutions 
passed by the security council against iraq since its aug 2 
invasion of neighboring kuwait 
baker said both governments prefer a peaceful end to the crisis 
but he said we find some differences of opinion as to what the 
best method of achieving a peaceful political solution would 
be 
later the state department official demanding anonymity said 
baker was not disappointed or discouraged by the visit 
we knew it was going to be a very tough nut the official 
said 
baker in response to questions from local reporters said the 
united states wanted to bring its troops home as soon as possible 
but he said saddam was a brutal dictator who wanted to develop 
a nuclear weapons capability this man must be stopped 
the state department official also said baker has raised with 
saudi officials concerns about the recent expulsion of hundreds of 
thousands of yemeni workers from the kingdom 
saudi arabia apparently angered by yemens sympathy for iraq 
has cancelled special privileges for yemeni workers and traders 
forcing them to have a saudi sponsor to do business in the country 
no such requirement previously existed 
before starting his talks baker took an hourlong stroll 
through the old city of sana a tangle of narrow streets dating 
back 2500 years hundreds of yemenis many wearing a traditional 
dagger strapped to their waists pushed in the crowded market area 
to get a glimpse of him 
friendly merchants offered baker a taste of the raisins nuts 
coffee and other food displayed for buyers 
baker who was escorted by iryani even rubbed his fingers on 
the green leaves of qat a mild narcotic that local residents 
sometimes chew to induce euphoria 
after his talks baker returned to jiddah where he was to meet 
with saudi officials on friday 
efforts to arrange a meeting with malaysian officials while in 
the region fell through malaysia also is a member of the security 
council 
he will travel next to bogota colombia to meet with president 
cesar gaviria colombia is another council member

mongolias communist party on thursday elected a 
new slate of leaders for the third time in less than a year 
reflecting fastpaced political changes in the sovietbloc nation 
the party also reaffirmed mongolias close ties to the soviet 
union and warned that antisoviet sentiment now openly and widely 
expressed is not in mongolias own best interests chinas 
official xinhua news agency reported 
mistakes in the past should not be exploited as excuses for 
opposing goodneighborly relations with the great neighbor and 
publishing various slanders against the soviet union xinhua 
paraphrased the mongolian party as saying in a statement 
xinhua filed its dispatch from the mongolian capital of ulan 
bator where the mongolian partys central committee has been 
meeting the partys formal name is the mongolian peoples 
revolutionary party 
mongolia is sandwiched between the soviet union and china 
xinhua said the central committee appointed five new members to 
the partys sixseat top body the presidium it first removed 
three presidium members for unspecified workrelated reasons while 
a fourth n michigdorg already had resigned to become ambassador 
to moscow 
xinhua did not mention the two other members of the old 
presidium party chairman gombojavyn ochirbat and l tudev 
director of the party newspaper unen they apparently retained 
their seats pushing the presidium size to seven members 
the presidium formerly known as the politburo sets basic 
policy for the party which has ruled mongolia for nearly seven 
decades 
it ruled by terror for much of that time but allowed multiparty 
elections in july for the first time ever and won a majority in the 
legislature new opposition parties also made a strong showing and 
now fill several key government posts 
mongolias dramatic changes began in march when the party bowed 
to months of popular demonstrations it appointed a new party 
leadership headed by ochirbat and renounced its monopoly on 
power a second shuffle was made a month later when the party 
replaced most of its central committee with younger proreform 
members 
the new appointments continue the trend the oldest of the five 
is budragchagyn dashyonden 44 the party secretary for ulan bator 
city 
earlier in the party central committee session ochirbat 
acknowledged that mongolias economic situation is worsening 
xinhua reported production has dropped while prices and 
unemployment have risen it said 
one reason for mongolias economic woes is a sharp reduction in 
soviet financial aid and trade as moscow tries to grapple with its 
own serious economic problems 
many mongolians blame moscow in part for the economys basic 
weaknesses including a weak manufacturing base for decades 
mongolia exported raw materials to the soviet union in return for 
finished products 
the example of soviet glasnost helped accelerate mongolias 
movement toward democracy and ironically made it possible for the 
first time for mongolians to openly express their resentment of 
soviet economic military political and cultural dominance

a small dent was discovered in the 
transalaska pipeline during an investigation of allegedly shoddy 
inspection work officials said 
but the reinspection of pipeline sections originally tested for 
corrosion and cracking by thorpe technical service has turned up 
nothing that implicates thorpe said alyeska pipeline service co 
spokeswoman marnie isaacs on wednesday 
alyeska officials not thorpe workers were responsible for 
making visual inspections of the pipe for flaws like the dent 
isaacs said 
fired thorpe employee edward thompson prompted the investigation 
more than a month ago by alleging that he and other workers were 
untrained and pipeline flaws were covered up plans to boost the 
pipelines flow have been put off until the investigation is 
complete 
the dent less than an inch across will be repaired next week

his family 
a truckload of soldiers spotting reporters at an air base just 
after president bush left shouted why are we over here this 
aint our war send us home 
in the desert of saudi arabia there was a serious american 
malady this thanksgiving homesickness 
there were no complaints about the turkey stuffing sweet 
potatoes or pie but it wasnt moms or grandmas and it had to be 
chowed down in about 30 minutes maximum so another of the 230000 
american troops in the persian gulf could get a seat at the table 
im very homesick right now said pfc tracey jackman 19 
of corry pa as she helped put up orange thanksgiving decorations 
and remembered wintery holidays past with her parents minutes 
later she burst into tears 
get this meal over with ill feel a lot better shouted 
sgt donald w engelhardt 31 of ft bragg nc an army cook 
with the 25th signals battalion who was carrying whole turkeys from 
the kitchen to the dining room to be used for decoration 
thanksgiving dont mean nothing to me because i dont have my 
loved ones with me he said if you werent putting out so much 
for a meal you wouldnt feel so bad im very homesick 
sgt donna hogg 32 of beverly hills calif who was the nanny 
for television personality ed mcmahon when her national guard unit 
got called up broke down as she said grace at a table with five 
fellow reservists 
we miss our families we wish we could be with them she 
said her voice cracking with emotion and we hope that they 
are as blessed as we are today 
her unit the 1113th transportation co from sacramento 
california had all spent a nearsleepless week getting the 
ingredients for thanksgiving dinner to military kitchens across the 
country 
its a lot more work thats about it said spec clint 
myers 19 of duncan oklahoma who was chopping lettuce for 
thanksgiving salad in a tent at a desert field kitchen and 
thinking about happier holidays watching football games with his 
grandfather 
the soldiers in the truck who shouted at reporters near the base 
that they wanted to go home were voicing the widespread sentiment 
of many troops who missed seeing bush during his sevenhour 
whirlwind visit 
he sent us all over here said sgt engelhardt if were 
going to go to war lets go to war if were going to go home 
lets go home 
sgt hogg said we shouldnt be here i figured we agreed to 
defend our country not to go defend oil and all that stuff thats

expecting their first child any day now said he hoped the 
confrontation with iraq could be settled without bloodshed 
theres too many gunghos out there he said a life is 
something very precious i just hope this thing gets settled really 
fast because this is a dangerous situation 
the us military got high marks for trying to bring 
thanksgiving to the desert and make servicemen feel close to home 
even if they didnt always succeed 
sgt lacey santee 25 of sacramento calif said the troops 
should look at every holiday as special no matter where they are 
youve just got to think your family is going to be with you 
no matter where youre at thats how i think of it she said

or somewhere around there theyre having a turkey dinner so its

us marines sang america and 
bowed their hatless heads in silent prayer thursday before tasting 
their thanksgiving turkey among the lengthening shadows in the 
saudi desert 
clusters of men from headquarters and service co of the 1st 
battalion 5th infantry regiment stacked their weapons and ate 
their supper sitting in the sand shaded by their humvee trucks and 
military vehicles 
they consumed their special meal without presidential fanfare 
without football and without the company of loved ones thousands of 
miles away but they gave thanks just the same 
we got to be thankful we havent gone to war yet and we pray 
theres a peaceful solution to all this said lance cpl steve 
soukup of coeburn virginia 
just before the marines queued up in chow line for their turkey 
treats more than a few of these deserthardened troops choked back 
tears when chaplain paschal dawson led them in a chorus of 
america and offered a prayer 
one of the things we have to be thankful for is we live in 
america said dawson a native of homer louisiana although 
were here its not the end of the world were here to do what we 
got to do 
because it was a holiday most of the marines had light duties 
and took advantage of their free time to play volleyball pitch 
softballs wrestle in the sand and write letters home 
coincidentally it was the units 100th day in the desert 
its a small price to pay when youre one of the worlds 
finest said lance cpl eddie simpson of sligo pennsylvania who 
was showing off his pet scorpion named taz 
marines are funny said 2nd lt tim nichols of sterling 
virginia they bitch a lot its hot the scorpions stink the 
wild dogs come around in the morning but well stay out here as 
long as were needed 
the dinner came from a field kitchen of the 1st marine 
expeditionary force probably the largest field kitchen in the 
marine corps since world war ii 
cooks got up at 3 am to begin preparing 12000 fresh turkey 
dinners about 3000 troops deployed closest to the kuwaiti border 
had to settle for the military version of turkey tv dinners 
they cooked 2500 pounds of turkey a ton of ham 34 cases of 
shrimp 34 cases of potatoes and handed out over 1800 pies they 
also distributed 2000 cases of soda pop enough for each marine to 
get two cans 
one of the dinners cooked here was delivered to president george 
bush who dined with another unit 
they didnt hear bushs speech and they couldnt watch football 
because the vast majority have no tvs there were no parades and no 
liquor but there were plenty of flies and desert heat 
you cant be mad because youre away from home said 
corpsman donnie henderson 23 of milwaukee wisconsin besides 
the marine corps is our family 
out in the field 1st sgt alonzo sledge of memphis tennessee 
was able to phone his family back in the states and attend 
battalion church services he was also standing by his horseshoe 
pit if the president had decided to come by and toss a few ringers 
everyone should be thankful were alive to see this day and 
were free said sledge a 20year veteran of the corps lots 
of people take things for granted that marines feel are special 
if there were regrets at being away they were balanced by duty 
people would be fools not to want to be home for thanksgiving 
and christmas but we got a job to do said cpl ed walsh 21 of 
las vegas nevada 
id rather be with the marines its where i belong they 
dont care if you eat your salad with the wrong fork walsh said 
but he had a tug from home because his mother sent him a 
cassette tape this week that said thanksgivings going to be 
rough because i wont have you to taste the stuffing to see that 
its just right

its troops deployed in the persian gulf sending 14000 more 
soldiers to join the 16000 already in the region

the gulf on thursday at the same cabinet meeting at which she was 
warned she would lose her bid for the party leadership and thus 
leadership of the country she later announced her resignation 
mrs thatcher has been an implacable opponent of iraqs takeover 
of kuwait and her party indicated her policies in the gulf would 
be continued 
former defense minister michael heseltine who challenged mrs 
thatcher for the party leadership and prompted her resignation

it was essential that the military capablity of the british 
force have total credibilty he said the announcement you have

the multinational forces in the region the secondlargest behind 
the united states which has sent 250000 and promised another 
100000 
defense secretary tom king went before the house of commons to 
explain the deployment 
it remains the governments firm objective to resolve this 
crisis as soon as possible and by peaceful means he told 
lawmakers to do this it is essential to establish a credible 
offensive military option 
saddam hussein must be made to realize that he is faced with a 
military force that will otherwise compel him to withdraw king 
said 
at least 26 nations have contributed troops to the multinational 
effort to force iraq out of kuwait which saddam hussein invaded 
aug 2 in a dispute over land oil and money 
the additional troops bring the strength of the 1st army 
division to 25000 and total british forces committed to the gulf

able to counter iraqs g5 howitzers 
king said he discussed the new troop deployment in meetings last 
week with saudi arabias king fahd who welcomed the news and 
offered to help provide food fuel trnsport and accomodations 
the announcement coincided with the resignation of prime 
minister margaret thatcher who sat behind king as he addressed the 
house of commons there was concern that britains domestic 
political problems not damage the effort to drive iraqi occupation 
forces from kuwait

a christian scientist couple convicted of 
manslaughter in the death of their 2yearold son have has asked 
for a sentence reduction charging that their probation is 
disruptive and unconstitutional 
lawyers for david and ginger twitchell filed a memorandum 
wednesday in suffolk superior court seeking to reduce the couples 
10year probation to five years and to eliminate regular medical 
checkups for their children 
the twitchells were convicted july 4 of involuntary manslaughter 
for relying on spiritual healing to treat their son robyn who died 
of a bowel obstruction on april 8 1986 the twitchells have 
appealed the verdict 
judge sandra hamlin had ordered the twitchells who now live in 
brentwood ny to take their three remaining children for 
periodic checkups by a physician and get them immediate medical 
attention if they showed signs of serious illness 
hamlin also ordered maximum probation supervision new york 
officials believe that means the twitchells must meet twice a week 
with a probation representative twitchell attorney stephen lyons 
told the boston herald 
i dont think judge hamlin intended the probation to be that 
intrusive lyons said 
in an affidavit filed with the court mrs twitchell 34 said 
her two youngest children have had medical checkups and the oldest 
has an appointment this week 
our life as a family would be less disrupted and more calm if 
the number of probation visits were reduced and if such visits were 
at our home only or if we could have the conversations regarding 
medical care by telephone she said 
the twitchell children range in age from 1 to 9 years old

the soviet union on thursday sent troops to beef 
up border posts along the troubled border between the southern 
republics of azerbaijan and armenia after four days of 
ethnicinspired shootings tass reported 
the official soviet news agency said armenian gunmen armed with 
heavycaliber machine guns trench mortars and flamethrowers 
stolen from soviet army depots have fired on border posts and 
several villages inside azerbaijan 
a total of two azerbaijanis and five armenians have been 
reportedly killed 
armenians and azerbaijanis have been clashing for nearly three 
years over control of nagornokarabakh a mainly armenian region 
inside of azerbaijan more than 220 people have been killed 
soviet interior ministry troops have repeatedly been dispatched 
to restore order 
tass did not say how many troops were sent thursday but it 
reported that 20 additional soldiers were dispatched wednesday as 
many as 29000 troops have been stationed in the area 
the concentration of government forces on a small section of 
border between the two transcaucasian republics was necessary to 
stop armenian gunmen vyacheslav ponomarev deputy commander of 
the interior ministry troops told tass 
he said the gunmen fired for four days on several villages in 
the lachin district of nagornokarabakh and on border posts in the 
mountainous goris district of armenia 
the border posts are located in the most dangerous areas of 
the terrorists activities ponomarev was quoted as saying we 
believe that this terrorist action had been thoroughly planned 
tass quoted viktor polyanichko second secretary of the 
communist party of azerbaijan as saying that armenian gunmen are 
destabilizing the situation in the region therefore it is 
necessary to act resolutely efficiently and consistently in 
combating them 
polyanichko said 53 people including children have been killed 
in lachin since the ethnic violence broke out in february 1988 
in an attempt to end this dispute and other ethnic violence 
president mikhail s gorbachev issued a decree in july ordering all 
outlawed guerrilla groups to turn in their weapons and disband the 
decree was largely ignored 
despite strict laws prohibiting gun ownership the use of 
illegal weapons is a growing problem in the soviet union many 
weapons are stolen from police stations and military bases or sold 
by afghan veterans

israel indicated thursday it was troubled by 
president bushs plans to meet syrian president hafez assad and 
unhappy that israel was not a stop on the presidents middle east 
visit 
syria has long been one of israels most intractable enemies it 
has one of the biggest arab armies and sponsors guerrilla groups 
that engage proisraeli forces in battle in southern lebanon 
the new concern surfaced amid strains in usisraeli ties over 
israels policies in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
i think to the extent that questions arise in israel over the 
meeting between president bush and hafez assad they are about the 
fact that for the past few months senior americans are visiting 
the region but not israel foreign minister moshe arens said 
we arent offended by this arens said in a speech at tel 
aviv university but added pointedly one can easily see that 
misunderstandings could arise of the fact that president bush 
travels to arab countries in the regionbut prefers not to visit 
israel 
arens also said there was a gap in perception between us and 
the united states regarding syria 
in israel we dont feel such a big difference between assad 
and iraqs saddam hussein he said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir was more circumspect in expressing 
concern 
we only hope this meeting between assad and the president of 
the united states will not encourage an aggressive policy by syria 
toward israel he said 
but shamir also suggested israel understood bushs need to 
reinforce an arab coalition against iraq 
we must look at the meeting tomorrow with assad on this 
background he said in an interview with state television and 
radio 
shamir is also facing some difficulties in arranging a white 
house meeting on his upcoming visit to washington israeli reports 
said they suggested the united states was anxious to avoid 
offending its arab allies in the antiiraq coalition 
some israeli editorial writers were also critical of the united 
states 
the american disregard for israel is infuriating and 
insulting it creates a deception for the arabs that after the 
persian gulf crisis is over the new coalition will be able to march 
together toward jerusalem said the daily hadashot

egyptian security agents sealed off parts of 
an eastern suburb thursday as president bush began an 18hour visit 
in cairo the measures were the tightest in memory for a visiting 
head of state 
hours before the president and mrs bush arrived rangers armed 
with automatic rifles conducted antiterrorist drills at cairo 
international airport where the presidents air force one was to 
park 
police with dogs patrolled the airport 
other security agents warned residents along the sixmile 
motorcade route to the palace where the bushes were staying to 
shutter their windows close their curtains and stay indoors as the 
official motorcade passed by 
hundreds of uniformed and plainclothed policemen lined the 
motorcade route and four helicopters clattered overhead 
a security helicopter hovered near the airport terminal where 
president hosni mubarak and his wife welcomed the bushes 
about 50 cars trailed the two presidential limousines as the 
motorcade set out for the kubbah presidential guest palace all 
roads leading to the palace had been sealed off by security forces 
two hours earlier 
the palace the residence of egypts last monarch king farouk 
is in a 70acre garden surrounded by thick concrete walls 13 feet 
tall with watch towers at the corners 
not all the security arrangements proved effective 
residents living along the motorcade route said they largely 
ignored the orders to stay indoors opening windows and standing on 
balconies to watch the procession 
two hours before the bushes arrived army rangers with automatic 
rifles and wearing fatigues carried out an antiterrorist drill on 
the tarmac where air force one was to land 
about 20 rangers repeatedly rushed toward a man apparently 
representing bush surrounding him and facing outward to protect 
him from imaginary terrorists

prime minister margaret thatchers international 
admirers praised her courage and achievements thursday after she 
announced she would resign even her foes tempered scorn with 
praise for a formidable adversary 
said president bush i will miss her 
he called her an outstanding ally of the united states 
adding you always knew where she was and what she believed 
vitaly ignatenko spokesman for soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev told the independent interfax news agency political 
economic and cultural ties between our countries have become of 
greater importance in the thatcher era our relations were 
marked by constructivism and dialogue 
the reluctance mrs thatcher showed toward increasing european 
unity was the source of most criticism but in a joyful and 
unambiguous response iraq saw the persian gulf crisis as cause of 
her downfall 
bitterness was undisguised in the comment from argentinas 
nicanor costa mendez foreign minister during his countrys 1982 
falklands war with britain 
i cant say that it makes me sad he said i believe that 
the extreme positions unnecessarily extreme unjustifiably 
extreme of the prime minister were one of the causes of the war 
and one of the biggest impediments to achieve agreement after 
socialist president mario soares of portugal singled out her 
systematic opposition to the advances of the european community 
during her long mandate he said the preoccupations of 
social justice receded many times before purely development 
objectives causing a climate of discontent in british public 
opinion to which mrs thatcher appeared insensitive 
but soares also lauded the british prime minister as a 
determined politician who took courageous positions on critical 
occasions in international life and without doubt marked an era in 
the contemporary history of her country 
german finance minister theo waigel noted despite her 
critical position on some questions of european integration she 
accomplished a great deal for european politics 
a neutral letter from socialist president francois mitterrand of 
france told mrs thatcher she had marked an important moment in 
the history of your country and that of europe 
iraqi government spokesman naji alhadithi said growing 
opposition to her hard line against iraq over its invasion of 
kuwait buried mrs thatcher just as the 1956 crisis over 
britains attack on the suez canal ruined former prime minister 
anthony eden 
britain stepped in after egypt nationalized the canal 
on thursday britain announced it was nearly doubling its troops 
deployed in the gulf as part of the multinational force arrayed 
against iraq sending 14000 more soldiers to join the 16000 
already in the region 
south african president fw de klerk praised mrs thatcher who 
opposed sanctions on south africa for standing up to world 
pressure and standing by pretoria 
she had faith in south africas ability to solve its problems 
in a democratic way she had the courage of her convictions 
he said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel saidafter hearing of 
her resignation that israel feels a moment of sorrow because we 
all know this special personality mrs thatcher who did many 
things and was an outstanding leader 
prime minister toshiki kaifu of japan said the british prime 
minister is a rare leader of firm convictions who was invigorated 
the united kingdom and i feel great regret that she has withdrawn 
from the front line 
belgiums prime minister wilfried martens applauded the 
determining role she played during more than 10 years in her own 
country and on the international scene 
said prime minister bob hawke of australia even those like 
myself who have been at odds with margaret thatcher on particular 
issues have admired her courage and tenacity of purpose 
whatever the forces arrayed against her she was always 
prepared to pursue with the utmost vigor those positions in which 
she believed 
dutch prime minister ruud lubbers said in the many years that 
she placed such an important stamp on the policies of the united 
kingdom mrs thatcher has shown that she does not avoid making 
difficult decisions that she deems to be in the nations interest 
this too is such a decision which deserves respect 
former french president valery giscard destaing now a 
legislator in the european parliament said mrs thatchers 
decision to quit was dignified and courageous 
margaret thatcher will be seen with winston churchill as the 
greatest british prime minister of the last 50 years the curtain 
has fallen on the iron lady she deserves our congratulations 
even european commission president jacques delors mrs 
thatchers archenemy in europe spoke of his high esteem for 
her despite their differences 
alfred dregger parliamentary leader of germanys governing 
christian democratic union said mrs thatcher played a major role 
in securing western solidarity in the historical conflict for 
freedom and democracy we thank her for that 
former president reagan spoke with great warmth of his closest 
foreign ally 
margaret thatchers resoluteness played a key role in ending 
the cold war he said she stood up to the soviets and let them 
know she meant business her deep and abiding dedication to the 
principles of liberty and democracy served as an inspiration to 
oppressed peoples everywhere who knew that margaret thatcher would 
never waver in her belief that all men and women are entitled to 
live in freedom

attorney general alfonso gomez resigned 
thursday following public criticism for his punishment of an army 
general involved in fighting leftist rebels 
in an angry letter to president cesar gaviria gomez objected to 
criticisms of officials who battle to maintain democracy 
gomez came under fire this month after ordering the removal of 
gen jesus armando arias who led the army in a bloody battle 
against the leftist guerrilla group m19 
m19 rebels took over bogotas palace of justice in 1985 and 
subsequent fighting with the army claimed about 100 lives 
including half the justices on colombias supreme court 
the attorney generals office said ariass troops unnecessarily 
killed dozens of civilians in routing the rebels 
it said arias failed to protect the lives of hostages held by 
the m19 
although gomez had talked of resigning since august the arias 
controversy appeared to expedite his exit 
army officers and rightwing politicians criticized the attorney 
general for punishing a defender of society they said former 
subversives were being unjustly praised 
in the years since the palace of justice clash the m19 has 
renounced armed struggle and become a legitimate political party 
opinion polls indicate the m19 will receive more votes than any 
other party for seats in an upcoming assembly to reform colombias 
constitution 
in his resignation letter gomez said politicians are using the 
arias case for their own electoral ends 
m19s leader antonio navarro called the decision to punish 
arias inopportune because it revived past controversy at a time his 
group needs support for the constitutional assembly 
members of congress rejected the decision to sanction arias who 
retired from active duty four months ago 
after the decision they voted him a symbolic promotion

the lebanese forces christian militia 
agreed thursday to withdraw from east beirut to allow the 
government to create a militiafree capital and reunite beirut 
after 15 years of civil war 
druse and shiite moslem militias already have pulled out of 
districts they controlled in the combatscarred city of 700000 
people 
samir geagea commander of the 6000strong christian force 
said he set no deadline for the evacuation to allow the government 
to decide how soon it will be able to fill the security vacuum 
created by withdrawal 
we have agreed to withdraw geagea said in an interview 
broadcast by his tv station the lebanese broadcasting corp 
we will pull out at a moments notice once the government 
readies the army force that will take over from us to avert a 
security vacuum 
the government will have to set the deadline geagea said 
defense minister albert mansour said earlier thursday 
implementation of the greater beirut plan will start today 
it will be an independence day gift for the lebanese people 
mansour spoke to reporters after a modest military parade in 
moslem west beirut to mark 47 years of independence from france for 
this nation of roughly 35 million people 
the decision marked a change in attitude by the lebanese forces 
the christians main fighting machine in the civil war against 
moslems the militia had defied a government order to withdraw by 
last monday nov 19 
geagea explained that the government has given us solid 
guarantees to prevent any reprisals in east beirut after we pull 
out 
he had demanded assurance that his christian rival elie 
hobeika would not move into east beirut once the lebanese forces 
leave 
hobeikas militiamen and syrianbacked irregulars moved into the 
eastern suburbs after lebanese army units backed by a syrian army 
contingent crushed an 11month rebellion by gen michel aoun in an 
eighthour battle on oct 13 
a lebanese forces official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the retreat to the hinterland several miles north and 
northeast of beirut could be completed in a day or two he 
would not speculate on when it might begin 
greater beirut stretches along a 15mile coastal strip from the 
dog river in the north to the damour river in the south 
president elias hrawi told the nation over television wednesday 
that greater beirut is coming and no one will be able to prevent 
its emergence

the vatican on thursday denied a german 
television report that its bank once held shares in a drug company 
producing birth control pills 
however a spokesman at the geneva headquarters of the 
pharmaceutical company serono named in the report said the 
vatican did have shares in its rome subsidiary in the 1960s and 
possibly early 1970s the spokesman cristophe lamps however 
denied the company made birth control pills 
were just the opposite we are the leader in fertility

the vatican vigorously prohibits its faithful to use any form of 
artificial birth control the pope recently urged roman catholic 
pharmacists not to sell drugs that directly or indirectly hurt 
life 
the german television report wednesday night on private station 
rtl plus alleged that the church received financial gain from the

pills in 1968 the year the roman catholic church staunchly laid 
out its opposition to artificial contraceptive methods in pope paul 
vis encyclical humanae vita 
the report said the vatican bank formally called the institute 
for religious works ior sold its shares in serono in 1970 to a 
milanbased bank in which it held a 20 percent stake 
the ior never possessed shares in the cited pharmaceutical 
company serono something that would be without a doubt be 
contrary to the aims of the institute vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro said in a written statement 
when told the vatican had denied its bank had held shares lamps 
said he didnt know which specific agency of the vatican held the 
shares 
lamps said he could not say whether the vatican holdings in 
serono had constituted a majority 
navarro could not be reached for further comment 
lamps said similar reports linking the vatican and serono have 
surfaced in the past

person norwegian television reported

from moscow that gorbachevs staff had discussed thursday whether 
the president should travel to oslo norway on dec 10 to collect

steinfeld said an adviser to gorbachev told him that if 
gorbachev does not come it is because of the troubles at home he 
did not identify the adviser or give other details

usual three days in norway that peace prize winners normally spend 
to attend a banquet and give a speech but gorbachev did say when 
he was awarded the prize last month that he would come to oslo to 
receive it

while most of us sat down and ate too much many wolfed down turkey

free and bart simpson barged down broadway 
and in the midst of the good times and celebration it was a day 
of tears for some whose loved ones were in the middle east 
television gave most of the country an armchair view of the 64th 
macys thanksgiving day parade in new york with its marching bands 
floats and heliumfilled cartoon character balloons 
more than 1 million people lined the streets to watch the parade 
with many of the youngsters cheering a huge figure of underachiever 
bart simpson

30footlong 15000 helium balloon of chilly willy the 
penguin broke away late wednesday and floated away 
at parade time thursday a pilot spotted the flightless bird at 
an altitude of about 5000 feet over detroit said bill robertson

in ontario

prime minister margaret thatcher called it quits 
thursday leaving her nation transformed by 11 years of 
thatcherism and her party torn by a bitter and potentially 
destructive struggle for succession 
the iron lady informed her cabinet of her decision to resign 
the morning after she declared she would fight on to a second 
round of the leadership election against former defense minister 
michael heseltine 
she told us of her decision and then got on with business 
said transport secretary cecil parkinson at the same cabinet 
meeting she decided to commit 14000 more british troops to the 
persian gulf 
as flowers and tributes poured into the official residence at 10 
downing street she passionately defended her government against a 
motion of noconfidence introduced by labor party leader neil 
kinnock 
im enjoying this im enjoying this she shouted in the 
house of commons full to overflowing for a sometimes rude 
sometimes sentimental debate a tiredlooking mrs thatcher was 
sometimes hoarse and frequently coughed 
the motion of censure which could have brought down the 
government was resoundingly defeated by a 120vote majority in the 
650seat house late thursday with no tory defectors 
no longer shackled by loyalty foreign secretary douglas hurd 
and treasury chief john major earlier thursday quickly jumped into 
the leadership contest which will be settled next week thursday 
was the deadline for nominations 
after succeeding laborite james callaghan as prime minister in 
1979 mrs thatcher relentlessly promoted capitalism in britain 
she sold many nationalized industries to private shareholders 
including british steel and british airways crushed the power of 
labor unions and cut tax rates 
by directing a risky but successful war against argentina in the 
falklands in 1982 and through her close relationship with president 
ronald reagan she was widely credited with restoring britains 
selfimage as a world power 
at home the party rebellion had been building for years but 
news that margaret thatcher walked away from a fight surprised the 
world 
i thought shed duke it out a us marine in saudi arabia 
remarked to president bush so did i the president said 
mrs thatcher 65 was europes longestserving prime minister 
in this century the only one to win three consecutive elections 
for 15 years the unchallenged leader of the conservative party 
the iron lady tag was an unintended tribute from moscow 
from the days in the 1970s when she was opposition leader and an 
enthusiastic cold warrior 
she decided to resign two days after joining 33 other world 
leaders in signing the charter of paris marking the formal end of 
the cold war 
mrs thatcher had chosen to play the world stage rather than 
stay home to campaign in tuesdays firstround battle with 
heseltine for the party leadership she hustled back wednesday 
replaced her campaign manager and personally lobbied for votes in 
the house tearoom but it was too late 
until the conservatives choose their new leader mrs thatcher 
is still prime minister and a fighting one at that she also 
retains her seat as a member of parliament from finchley in north 
london 
i do look back with some pride and some satisfaction at our 
achievements for our country over the last 11 years she said 
conservative lawmakers accepted her departure with sadness and 
relief praising her courage in putting the party before herself 
the labor party lauded the grocers daughter but didnt hide 
its glee the news kinnock said was very good indeed i cannot 
pretend otherwise 
mrs thatcher released a statement through her office saying 
i have concluded the unity of the party and prospects of victory 
in a general election would be better served if i stood down to 
enable cabinet colleagues to enter the ballot for the leadership 
kinnock redirecting his fire to the leader to come told mrs 
thatcher you showed that you amount to more than those who have 
turned on you in recent days 
he pressed his demand for a national election which mrs 
thatcher said was no more possible than when labor prime minister 
harold wilson resigned in 1976 and was succeeded by callaghan 
hurd and major who issued a joint statement pledging a 
friendly campaign sat together in the house heseltine sat 
further away 
though mrs thatcher finished 52 votes ahead of heseltine in the 
leadership ballot tuesday it wasnt enough to win and some cabinet 
members warned her that support was eroding 
on tuesday a simple majority of 187 of the 372 tory lawmakers 
will be sufficient to win if necessary a third and final ballot 
will be held on thursday 
the conservatives have trailed labor for 16 months in opinion 
polls following a rash of unpopular measures including a percapita 
tax to replace the property tax 
anxiety over their chances in a general election which must be 
held by mid1992 fomented the conservative party rebellion that 
led to mrs thatchers downfall 
her daughter carol said the prime minister was the victim of 
a gutless act of treachery

the russian republics 500day economic reform 
plan cannot be fully implemented without the national governments 
help the prime minister of the largest and richest republic said 
thursday 
ivan silayevs comments to the russian federation parliament 
were a tacit acknowledgment that russia lacks clear control over 
key economic catalysts such as prices currency interest rates and 
land 
russian president boris n yeltsin moved ahead with the 500day 
program to move to a free market economy on nov 1 after the 
national government adopted a slower less radical blueprint 
favored by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev yeltsins 
political rival 
the national and russian governments have issued conflicting 
orders that have effectively torpedoed both plans 
a considerable part of the 500days program can and will be 
implemented but it is not a totally autonomous republican 
plan and hinges on decisions by the national government the 
official tass news agency quoted silayav as saying silayav did not 
elaborate on his comment tass said 
russia has half the soviet unions 285 million people 
threequarters of its land mass and the bulk of its natural 
resources 
earlier thursday the russian parliament accepted the 
resignation of deputy prime minister grigory yavlinsky coauthor 
of a 500day plan designed to be implemented by the entire soviet 
union 
yavlinsky formally offered his resignation oct 17 after 
gorbachev came out in favor of the less radical plan 
lawmakers postponed the vote on yavlinskys resignation to give 
him time to reconsider but silayev urged them thursday to accept 
it deputies voted 16417 to accept the resignation the 
independent news agency interfax reported 
i do this with regret but yavlinsky wants to work in another 
capacity tass quoted silayev as saying 
a government spokesman said yavlinsky has been offered the job 
as chairman of yeltsins council of economic advisers 
yavlinskys resignation came a day after yeltsin declared the 15 
soviet republics could no longer wait for a new union treaty and 
were proceeding on their own to create a new economic union 
yeltsin on wednesday signed a treaty with the central asian 
republic of kazakhstan it was russias fourth bilateral treaty 
with another republic the treaties which bypass the kremlin 
cover direct economic political and cultural ties 
yeltsin signed a similar treaty with the ukraine on monday and 
earlier concluded pacts with moldavia and georgia 
on thursday he met latvian president anatoly gorbunov and prime 
minister ivars godmanis to continue negotiating a treaty with the 
baltic republic 
the ukrainian treaty was approved by the republics lawmakers on 
thursday and parliamentary president leonid kravchuk praised it 
because our desires and actions were not imposed upon us by 
anybody

new prime ministers chandra shekhar of 
india and nawaz sharif of pakistan agreed thursday to talk out 
their differences but refused to budge on the issue that nearly 
brought them to war last spring 
they will resume talks on reducing tensions in kashmir province 
and on two minor border issues said a joint statement 
their meeting on a sandy tropical indian ocean island was the 
first in two years by leaders of the two rival nations and the 
first foreign policy encounter for both men who took office less 
than three weeks ago 
it was held during a threeday summit of the sevennation south 
asia association for regional cooperation 
chandra shekhar told indian reporters i felt right at home 
at his meeting with sharif it was just like a family gathering 
i found him to be very cooperative we are both eager to have the 
best of relations 
india and pakistan mobilized their armies for war after india 
cracked down on propakistani moslem insurgents in jammukashmir 
the only state in hindudominated india with a moslem majority 
fighting was averted largely through us diplomatic efforts 
the two prime ministers decided that all differences between 
the two countries should be resolved peacefully and through 
dialogue said the statement read by pakistans foreign 
secretary shaharyar khan 
he said sharif raised the kashmir issue and outlined pakistans 
position chandra shekhar restated indias stand on interference 
in indias internal matters 
pakistan says kashmirs future should be determined by a 
plebiscite as called for in united nations resolutions india says 
kashmir is its sovereign territory and cannot be severed 
the issue has simmered since 1947 when colonial india won 
independence from britain and was divided into india and pakistan 
on religious lines kashmir then an independent princely state 
ruled by a hindu king had the option of joining either country 
the king chose india pakistan objected saying the people of 
kashmir should have had a say 
chandra shekhar said the hostilities were deflecting energy from 
the main task of improving the lot of the desperately poor south 
asian countries 
poverty is the enemy if we fight each other we wont be able 
to fight poverty he said 
he and sharif set dec 18 as the date for their foreign 
secretaries to resume talks on confidencebuilding measures along 
their frontier

emperor akihito on friday completed a centuriesold 
ceremony signifying his accession to the worlds oldest hereditary 
throne while protests were held against the monarchy and the high 
cost of the rite 
the shinto ceremony symbolizing communion with the sun goddess 
has been performed by most of japans emperors since at least the 
7th century and in the past was believed to give monarchs their 
status as living god 
but demonstrators across the country criticized the ritual as a 
violation of the japanese constitutions separation of church and 
state and questioned the use of nearly 17 million in tax money on 
the ceremony 
other critics of the daijosai or great food offering ritual 
also believe holding it indicates a desire within japans 
conservative government to bring back the emperor worship of prewar 
days 
the rite witnessed by only two female attendants was held 
thursday night and then repeated before dawn friday 
antimonarchy radicals marked the beginning of the ceremony by 
launching six mortarlike projectiles at an imperial villa in 
kyoto in western japan police said 
radicals were also believed to have set fires at three shinto 
shrines and four train stations outside of the capital of tokyo 
just after midnight no injuries were reported 
separate peaceful protests were staged by scholars and labor 
unionists and 1000 christians fasted to protest the funding of 
the rite 
akihito 56 is the first japanese emperor to be enthroned since 
his father the late emperor hirohito assumed the chrysanthemum 
throne 62 years ago 
he is also the first to assume the throne under japans postwar 
constitution which calls him not a godking but a symbol of his 
peoples sovereignty 
akihitos formal state enthronement ceremony nov 12 was viewed 
by foreign dignitaries representing 158 countries but no 
foreigners were invited to the communion 
during the rite akihito offered rice wine and other foods from 
around the country to the sun goddess amaterasu from whom legend 
says the imperial line descended 
the two women attendants are clad in white and red kimono and 
with their hair tied in pony tails nearly 6 feet long the 
ceremony is held in the torchlit inner sanctuary of a specially 
built hall on the palace grounds 
the rite is performed only once by each emperor 
inside the sanctuary out of view of the 733 japanese guests 
seated in large tents nearby the offerings were made to an altar 
placed beside a stylized bed from which the goddess is summoned 
scholars before world war ii theorized that at one time the 
ceremony might have involved the emperor symbolically having sex 
with the sun goddess representing a union with the divine palace 
officials however deny that theory and said the emperor would not 
touch the bed 
the second ceremony was repeated after midnight in an identical 
hall yards from the first one 
akihito performs dozens of religious ceremonies at the palace 
each year carrying on the priestking role that has been handed 
down from ancient times 
that role however has periodically come under fire since the 
end of world war ii 
hirohito who died in 1989 at age 87 renounced the concept of 
imperial divinity in 1946 at the urging of the usled occupation 
forces the countrys postwar constitution specifies that the 
emperor is a national symbol and not a godking

nearly 4000 ethiopian jews are expected in 
israel by the end of next month following an agreement in addis 
ababa to let them emigrate news reports said thursday 
the renewed emigration appears to be the culmination of a 
fourmonth hiatus triggered by tensions between the ethiopian 
government and israel israeli television said 
ethiopian leaders accused israel of failing to honor agreements 
reached when the countries renewed diplomatic ties in october 1989 
the report said 
it said tensions between jerusalem and addis ababa had been 
eased but didnt elaborate two official israeli delegations have 
visited the ethiopian capital to discuss the issue the past month 
uri gordon chairman of the jewish agencys immigration 
department said 2822 jews have come to israel from ethiopia since 
january the national itim news agency reported another 1000 are 
expected in the next five weeks the television report said 
according to the television report about 20000 jews remain 
crowded in difficult conditions in the ethiopian capital awaiting 
permits to emigrate

arriving at ben gurion airport outside tel aviv before dawn 
thursday most of the adults wore long white embroidered robes and 
turbans 
for me today it is like the sunrise newcomer andshe 
vorbaneh said 
an israeli parliament member visiting addis ababa charged 
thursday that israeli embassy officials had arbitrarily denied some 
ethiopian jews visas claiming they provided inadequate proof of 
jewishness 
some people who had the right to demand the law of return had 
the right taken away from them shimon shetreet said on israel 
radio 
the 1950 law guarantees all jews the right to immigrate to 
israel 
the foreign ministry denied shetreets charge pointing out the 
very strict criteria for those who are entitled to enjoy the law 
of return and those that cannot

thousands of gold prospectors expelled 
from yanomami indian lands have invaded other amazon reserves and 
spread malaria among the tribes an indian chief said thursday 
the claims were made as representatives from 12 indigenous 
groups of the farwestern amazon state of roraima came to the 
capital in search of medical aid the indian chiefs also want the 
government to demarcate their lands and expel the miners 
makuxi chief jaci said thursday that about 8000 gold miners 
were spreading malaria among his 12000member tribe the makuxis 
mostly farmers inhabit a large reserve near the venezuelan border 
the indian leader said 154 of 990 makuxi in four villages had 
been infected the last three months five of those had died 
including his own wife 
in addition he said 122 ranchers had also occupied large tracts 
of the makuxi reserve taking advantage of the lack of reserve 
markings 
last january the government ordered the miners off the reserve 
of the yanomamis the worlds largest primitive tribe but since 
then the prospectors have poured into a region near the guyana 
border in search of gold and diamonds jaci said 
neither the national indian foundation nor the justice ministry 
would meet with the indian chiefs on thursday jaci said 
the government has said it lacks the money needed to demarcate 
the tribes lands and remove the miners by force 
all the medical attention is given to the yanomamis the 
government has forgotten the rest of us jaci complained 
the yanomamis are also being decimated by diseases from about 
40000 gold prospectors who have flooded into the mineralrich 
region the last three years 
brazils indian missionary council sponsored by the roman 
catholic church estimates that 1500 of the remaining 9000 
yanomamis have died in three years most from malaria and sexual 
diseases brought by miners some have died in conflicts with the 
miners the council says 
the indians medical situation has improved recently according 
to government officials because of an emergency health campaign 
that it says has cut the incidence of malaria in indian villages 
from 90 percent to 18 percent 
federal police have also begun operation free yanomami 
jungle to force the miners off the indian lands about 140 
troops are dynamiting 120 clandestine landing strips cut in the 
jungle and used to supply mining sites by air 
brazils indians have steadily dwindled in number since 1987 
when the clandestine rush to the amazon began after government 
studies indicated a wealth of gold diamonds tin and bauxite 
there 
prospectors and landless peasants have leveled rain forests 
chased off fish and game polluted rivers with mercury used in gold 
panning and spread diseases previously unknown to the tribes 
there are about 215000 native indians left in brazil down from 
an estimated 5 million when the portuguese landed here in 1500

socialist deputies carried prime minister 
andrei lukanovs austerity budget through parliament early friday 
but main opposition parties boycotted the secret ballot and moved 
for a vote of noconfidence 
approval of the budget 186 votes for 10 against seven 
abstentions and one invalid ballot ended weeks of parliamentary 
squabbling 
lukanov had pinned his fate and that of his government on budget 
approval 
the union of democratic forces boycotted the vote and demanded a 
separate vote of noconfidence in the 400seat grand national 
assembly 
socialist deputies agreed to meet the challenge but only when 
parliament reconvened later friday 
lukanovs foes decided to shun the budget vote after losing 
197160 on a vote to decide the issue by secret ballot instead of 
the regular show of hands 
the socialists formerly the communists ousted hardline leader 
todor zhivkov on nov 10 1989 won free elections in june and 
named lukanov premier 
his popularity has waned because of political stalemate 
rationing and shortages of food and consumer goods his foes claim 
they would win new elections 
the opposition rejects lukanovs invitation to join a broad 
socialistled coalition government insisting instead on choosing 
the premier and holding key ministries 
however one prominent udf leader rumen vodenicharov on 
thursday assailed the opposition leadership for boycotting the vote 
and charged it with being blinded by the desire to get into 
power he said he was quitting the coalitions parliamentary 
group and would continue in parliament as an independent 
he told deputies he supported the budget measures which include 
privatization and price rises of 200 to 500 percent on some basic 
consumer goods including some foods to offset a budget deficit 
vodenicharov said the opposition promoted obstructive 
politics that are only delaying the start of economic reform 
lukanov has faced increasing public pressure to resign as 
disgruntled bulgarians have taken to the streets protesting their 
economic straits 
up to 50000 supporters and opponents of the governing 
socialists had massed outside the grand national assembly to wait 
for the results of the parliamentary session thursday 
opposition supporters formed a human chain around the building 
but were kept at bay by police some in riot gear 
only a few hundred remained outside in the wintry weather by the 
time the result was announced 
inside a brief scuffle broke out at the rostrum at one point 
and microphones were overturned in a dispute over whether the 
budget vote or a noconfidence vote should come first order was 
quickly restored 
lukanovs socialist party has a majority of 210 seats against 
144 seats for the opposition union after vodenicharovs defection 
the agrarians have 16 seats and the ethnic turkish movement for 
rights and freedoms hold 23 small parties and independents hold 
the remainder 
the socialists have been unable to halt economic decline and 
improve food supplies but rejected calls to hand power to the 
opposition 
the resulting deadlock has fueled street protests and pressure 
on the lukanov government to resign because of inaction 
the opposition podkrepa trade union called a general strike 
starting monday if lukanov did not step down thursday

the chief of romanias new 
intelligence service told lawmakers thursday the files of the late 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescus securitate secret police 
should stay closed indefinitely 
virgil margureanu boss of the newly created romanian 
intelligence service addressed parliament before deputies debated 
a planned law regulating the services operations 
he said opening securitate files to the public could cause 
instability and fan suspicion 
many government opponents insist the securitate has not been 
disbanded and still taps phones intercepts mail and employs other 
methods used under ceausescu to control romanian society that 
belief is shared by many romanians 
last month margureanu told reporters that authorities would 
reveal the names of former securitate agents he backed away from 
that position thursday 
he said keeping securitate files sealed would be a natural 
solution for consolidating a climate of stability and 
eliminating the sources of suspicion 
margureanu said the securitate had employed 14259 military and 
984 civilian personnel last month he acknowledged that the new 
intelligence service had rehired some former securitate agents 
margureanu appealed for swift passage of the law saying it 
would help his agency deal with a fascist menace and hundreds 
of terrorist threats he claimed were received by romanian 
politicians 
since the communist dictatorship was ousted and ceausescu was 
executed last december many officials have warned of a resurgence 
of fascism by former members of the legionnaires movement that 
supported nazi germany 
they are said to have been active outside the country during 
romanias 45 years of communist rule 
opposition figures say the government is trying to whip up a 
fear of renewed fascism to divert attention from the deteriorating 
economy and other issues 
margureanu insisted his service was not tapping phones or 
intercepting mail 
antigovernment protests continued in bucharest thursday about 
2000 protesters marched downtown shouting slogans against 
president ion iliescu and premier petre roman whose national 
salvation front took power in the revolution and won elections in 
may 
in sibiu thousands ook part in an antigovernment rally 
thursday organized by the opposition national peasant party the 
democratic union of hungarians in romania and several unions 
tension rose in romania after the government on nov 1 ordered 
price increases that doubled and tripled the cost of many items 
most essential foods energy and rents remain subsidized for now

papers to shut down since the end of a press boom in the late 
1980s when a crop of new publications hit the stands investors 
had hoped for advertising revenue in one of europes fastest 
growing economies 
but the market was unable to sustain the increasing number of 
papers in a country where almost 20 percent of the 103 million 
people are illiterate 
the weekly tempo was founded in 1975 as a conservative voice 
while much of the media swung to the left following a 1974 
revolution that overthrew portugals 48year rightist dictatorship 
the papers editorial line was often marked by a strong 
opposition to leftist movements in portugals former african 
colonies 
the paper which had a circulation of 71000 in 1978 currently 
sells about 17000 copies 
the centerright government is hoping to boost the press 
industry by privatizing stateowned papers 
several papers have been sold and the last remaining stateowned 
paper diario de noticias is scheduled for privatization next 
year

members of the medellin cocaine cartel 
offered thursday to turn themselves in if the government protects 
their security and promises not to send them to the united states 
a statement from the cartel said from 200 to 300 of its members 
would be willing to congregate in a special armyprotected 
compound 
such a surrender implies the end of all activities related to 
drug trafficking or narcoterrorism it said 
it did not indicate if the surrender offer included pablo 
escobar the medellin cartels leader 
the statement was given to the presidency which distributed it 
to news media 
in response justice minister jaime giraldo outlined legal 
guarantees drug traffickers would enjoy upon surrendering 
in september president cesar gaviria offered to bar 
extraditions and cut jail sentences of drug traffickers who gave up 
and confessed their crimes 
the traffickers on thursday apparently accepted with 
conditions 
they asked not to be required to confess saying this would 
constitute selfincrimination prohibited even in the united 
states 
giraldo said a confession of all crimes committed is not 
required just some of them 
he said traffickers who surrender can be sure they will not be 
extradited 
the traffickers said they would expect special army protection 
and oversight by world human rights organizations 
the cartel has been blamed for killing about 550 colombians 
since the government and drug traffickers declared war on each 
other after a political assassination in august 1989 
traffickers have kidnapped nine journalists drug bosses said 
the abductions were a response to human rights abuses by police in 
medellin the cartels home city 
the drug smugglers also apparently are trying to pressure 
authorities to grant them a pardon 
on thursday the drug lords said they should not be treated like 
common criminals

president bush says he is in a hurry to sign 
a freetrade pact with mexico 
we have made a commitment to a freetrade agreement with 
mexico we want to do it as soon as possible bush told the 
mexican government news agency notimex in an interview made public 
thursday 
the interview published in spanish was conducted in 
washington and released four days before bush is scheduled to meet 
with mexican president carlos salinas de gortari in the northern 
state of nuevo leon 
the freetrade agreement is expected to be one of the main 
topics of discussion at the twoday summit beginning monday 
bush said he looks favorably on including canada in talks for a 
threeway freetrade agreement but only if that doesnt slow the 
process 
if the effort to broaden the process is not viable because it 
produces unacceptable delays we will proceed bilaterally with 
mexico notimex quoted bush as saying 
canadian finance and labor representatives have warned mexico to 
proceed with caution in signing such an agreement canada and the 
united states signed a bilateral trade agreement in 1988 the pact 
began in part this year 
bush said he was grateful for mexicos continued supply of 
petroleum exports especially in the wake of the embargo on middle 
eastern oil imposed after iraqs invasion of kuwait notimex 
reported 
the president also expressed interest in us investment in 
mexicos nationalized oil industry 
we recognize that petroleum frequently has been an area of 
special sensitivity for mexico particularly in its relations with 
the united states however i am convinced that there are 
important areas in which we can work together and which can be 
mutually beneficial for increased investment and exploration of 
petroleum and natural gas the agency quoted bush as saying 
the mexican government nationalized the oil industry in 1939 
ousting foreign corporations salinas 2yearold administration 
has returned many nationalized industries including 
petrochemicals to the private sector 
but salinas has maintained that primary petroleum production 
will remain in the hands of the state

albania the last hardline communist 
country in europe said thursday it wants to take part in european 
integration but it rejected the idea that foreign pressure could 
set the pace for reforms there 
an editorial in albanias official zeri i popullit newspaper 
also indicated that the tirana leadership is still opposed to the 
type of radical changes that swept communists from power in eastern 
europe 
albanian officials attended this weeks 34nation european 
summit in paris as observers 
according to excerpts of the editorial carried by the staterun 
news agency ata monitored in vienna democratization is under way 
in politics the economy and human rights 
but the report said it was not normal that albania does not 
receive credit in europe for the changes 
the editorial quoted president ramiz alia who is also the party 
leader as saying some european leaders are using their consensus 
regarding albania as a pressure to dictate different political 
recipes and conditions to our country 
it did not mention specific european leaders according to the 
ata report alia reportedly told a recent party meeting that 
albania will do nothing under foreign dictate and added the 
albanian people have never put on auction their freedom 
independence and national sovereignty 
following the eastern european revolutions albania has moved 
slowly to open up to the outside world increasing contacts and 
trade with foreign governments and allowing visits by foreign news 
media but the changes have not gone as far as multiparty 
elections 
albania will continue to march in the spirit of european 
developments and will render its modest contribution to the whole 
process of the conference on security and cooperation in europe 
the editorial said

a fouryear boom that brought a new era of 
affluence to japan appears to be subsiding as a labor shortage 
higher interest rates and the persian gulf crisis take their toll 
on the economy 
demand for domestic goods and strong corporate investment will 
insulate the economy from the worst of the us economic downturn 
and ensure that land prices fall gradually rather than plummet 
said russell jones an economist at ubs phillips and drew 
international ltd 
but growing corporate bankruptcies and lackluster midyear 
corporate profits are signs that the economy is shifting into lower 
gear after four years of annual growth of 5 percent or more 
analysts say 
the economys beginning to slow but its a slow slowdown the 
deceleration is not that pronounced its not a collapse jones 
said 
most economists cite higher interest rates introduced to cool 
inflation as a key constraint especially for smaller firms that 
borrow for investment 
the bank of japan has raised the official rate it charges 
commercial banks five times since may 1989 from 25 percent to 6 
percent that has ended the source of cheap capital that helped 
fuel the boom that began in december 1986 
partly because of higher interest rates corporate bankruptcies 
in japan increased in october for the first time in 70 months 
climbing 97 percent from the year before to 645 cases teikoku 
data bank reported 
hardest hit were real estate firms weakened by flattening land 
prices and small and mediumsize manufacturers suffering from a 
severe labor shortage the private credit research agency said 
at the same time companies found their financial cushions of 
stock assets flattened by lower share prices 
the nikkei stock average the tokyo markets key indicator has 
dropped more than 40 percent this year the return on financial 
assets has plummeted and cheap equity financing has become 
difficult said masahide tsuru of the long term credit banks 
economics division 
the bankruptcies indicate the impact of the labor shortage and 
interest rates at the operating level at the recurring level 
declines in the equity and bond markets are compounding 
everything said peter morgan chief economist at barclays de 
zoete wedd securities japan 
a survey by wako research institute of economics showed that 
profits of major corporations for the sixmonth period ending in 
september climbed only 003 percent from the same period in 1989 
during the previous six months profits climbed 144 percent from a 
year earlier 
the survey excluded banks and securities firms whose profits 
have fallen sharply with the nikkeis plunge 
manufacturers meanwhile are facing lower demand from importers 
in the united states which is undergoing a more pronounced 
downturn japanese semiconductor manufacturers have already 
announced they will slash computer chip output because of lower 
demand from us importers 
growth in consumer spending which accounts for about 60 percent 
of gross national product has begun to slow partly because of the 
bearish financial markets 
higher interest rates also have made credit purchases of major 
items such as cars and homes much more costly said johsen 
takahashi director of the private thinktank mitsubishi research 
institute 
consumption which grew steadily by 2 percent to 3 percent until 
may began to slow in july it rose only 06 percent in september 
from a year earlier marking the slowest growth this year the 
management and coordination agency said in a report released 
wednesday 
not all the economic news is bad for japan though lower us 
interest rates have tended to weaken the dollar making the yen 
relatively stronger noted barclays de zoete wedds peter morgan 
that means japanese products are more expensive abroad but 
imports of fuel and other goods are cheaper thats become 
increasingly important with surging oil prices caused by the middle 
east crisis 
barring a major cut in oil supplies economists expect japans 
economy to continue chugging along although at a slower pace most 
expect economic growth to remain at a robust 5 percent to 6 percent 
in 1990 and to level off over the next several years to around 4 
percent 
this isnt going to be a recession there wont be a huge fall 
in the standard of living said lawrence s prager chief analyst 
and strategist at nikko securites co its just a slowdown

the government said wednesday it hopes to raise 
102 billion in the first stage of its electricity industry 
selloff its biggest and most complex privatization in the last 10 
years 
twenty percent of the 216 billion shares being sold will be 
offered to foreign investors the shares will sell for for 240 
pence 473 each or a total 518 billion pounds the government 
said 
the offering caps prime minister margaret thatchers huge 
privatization program which already has raised 65 billion or 33 
billion pounds through the sales of britains telephone gas and 
water utilities and such companies as british airways plc 
the sales are intended to create efficient competitive 
companies and encourage wider ownership of those companies 
there has been some nervousness about how successful the recent 
privatizations will be with a nervous stock market the continuing 
middle east crisis and the current struggle for leadership within 
britains governing conservative party 
investors also remember the sale of the governments onethird 
stake in british petroleum co plc which flopped because it 
coincided with the october 1987 stock market crash 
but energy secretary john wakeham said 73 million people have 
registered an interest in buying the electric utility shares 
second only to the record 75 million registrations for british gas 
plc 
i dont see any signs of any serious effects on the stock 
market or sterling as a result of the election for leadership 
wakeham said referring to thatchers failure this week to defeat 
michael heseltine for the leadership of the conservative party 
another vote will be held next week 
the government also has calmed jitters about the offering by 
announcing it would scrap the sale if war broke out in the persian 
gulf 
there is no major risk i think in todays market conditions 
the offer will be a success said chris rowland an electricity 
analyst with the london investment firm barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
the government on wednesday signaled its confidence by going 
ahead and selling 100 percent of each of the 12 regional 
electricity companies of england and wales it had been considering 
scaling the offer back to 60 percent if market conditions were 
poor 
this is the first step in meeting the governments objective 
of privatizing the electricity industry within the lifetime of this 
parliament wakeham said 
the government plans to sell its two electricity generating 
companies and the scottish electricity industry next year the 
shares are expected to fetch a 20 percent premium when trading 
starts dec 11 the application deadline is dec 5 
shareholders are to receive an average 84 percent dividend 
return in the first year wakeham said 
the government has sought to enhance the sale with an 
installment payment plan of nearly two years the longest ever and 
with bonus shares and discounts on electricity bills types of 
perks it has offered in the past 
rowland described the price as attractive but opposition 
lawmaker frank dobson the labor partys spokesman on energy 
matters attacked the price as overly cheap he accused the 
government of selling 16 billion pounds 32 billion of assets for 
5 billion pounds 10 billion 
the government said at least 34 percent of the shares will be 
reserved for the general public in britain and the remaining 46 
percent will go to british institutional investors 
if there is heavy british demand for the shares the 20 percent 
offering to foreign investors will be scaled back the government 
said

the backers of two proposed cable television 
channels devoted to covering the legal system have decided to 
cooperate on a single courtroom network avoiding what could have 
been a costly competition 
the courtroom television network is expected to be launched next 
summer 
time warner inc which hoped to launch its own courtroom 
network next year and national broadcasting co and the 
programming division of cablevision systems corp which were 
developing a similar service said wednesday they agreed to form a 
partnership to create a channel devoted exclusively to coverage of 
the courts and legal issues 
terms were not disclosed the deal is subject to approval by 
their respective boards 
the plan calls for time warner to manage the new service through 
its affiliate american lawyer media lp which publishes 11 legal 
titles including the monthly american lawyer magazine american 
lawyer president and chief executive steven brill will be chief 
executive of the joint cable venture 
the courtroom television network will provide continuous live 
and taped coverage of trials legal reports and commentary from 
legal experts 
its backers say there is a big audience for television that 
focuses on legal issues 
but planners of the competing services found many cable tv 
systems simply didnt have extra channel space for two legal 
networks and were slow in picking between them a tight capital 
market meanwhile has made it more difficult for operators to 
raise money for expansion of channel capacity 
the operators are as a result prudent and cautious in adding 
new services said sharon patrick president of cablevisions 
rainbow programming holdings inc but we feel that combining the 
distribution the capital and the talent of the two of them creates 
the strongest new service in cable 
time warner owns cable operations with an estimated 64 million 
household subscribers while cablevision systems has about 16 
million subscribers 
discussions are underway with other cable systems about taking 
the courtroom channel 
cablevision systems had originally planned to have its courtroom 
cable network called in court in operation this fall it hired 
arthur miller the harvard law professor as its chief legal 
analyst and a staff of about 15 to 20 other people ms patrick 
said 
time warner has never disclosed a proposed launch date for its 
courtroom service which was tentatively called the american 
courtroom network 
it hired fred graham formerly the supreme court reporter for 
the new york times and cbs news as its chief anchor 
graham will take that role on the proposed network and miller 
floyd abrams f lee bailey david boies robert bork arthur liman 
and barry slotnick will serves as commentators the network will 
also draw on work from american lawyers more than 200 legal 
journalists 
larry gerbrandt who follows the cable industry for paul kagan 
associates in carmel calif said the combination of the two 
proposed legal channels makes it more likely that a courtroom 
channel will succeed 
this is not an environment where either time warner or 
cablevision wants to sustain longterm losses combined this 
network has a chance to launch much faster be larger and be more 
profitable more quickly he said 
he noted that two cable comedy channels for instance were 
launched in the past year but neither has approached the 25 million 
subscribers he says are needed to attract advertisers and generate 
sufficient licensing fees to cover overhead costs about 54 million 
us households get cable tv 
time warners comedy channel launched in november 1989 is on 
systems with 75 million subscribers while viacom incs ha 
channel has 65 million 
talks about merging those services broke off earlier this year 
the comedy wars have been plenty expensive gerbrandt said 
he agreed there may be an appetite for a legal channel 
its americas ultimate ongoing theater he said

lawsuits seeking tens of millions of dollars in 
damages and challenging laventhol amp horwaths audits have put the 
nations seventhlargest accounting firm in bankruptcy court 
laventhol wednesday filed under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy 
laws which allows a company to continue operating while it 
reorganizes and pays creditors but the philadelphiabased 
accounting firm said its name was so tarnished by the filing that 
it cannot keep operating on its own 
instead many of laventhols 318 partners plan to open 
independent offices in cities where the firm operated these 
offices would attempt to retain laventhol clients and funnel income 
to the parent company allowing it to pay its debts according to 
the filing in us bankruptcy court in manhattan 
in addition laventhol partners that find work at other firms 
would continue to service laventhol accounts under the plan 
laventhol which said earlier this week it would be forced to 
take the step said the bankruptcy filing was prompted in part by 
the cost of settling or defending itself against more than 100 
lawsuits seeking tens of millions of dollars in damages 
the suits primarily were initiated by clients challenging 
laventhol audits or by shareholders of client companies claiming 
laventhol provided faulty financial information 
michael crames a new yorkbased lawyer for laventhol said the 
plan was novel and that it provides the best chance for creditors 
to be repaid 
laventhol said the court must suspend the lawsuits it faces in 
order for the plan to work laventhol received a temporary 
injunction wednesday halting the suits and plans to seek a 
permanent bar at a dec 4 hearing before us bankruptcy judge 
cornelius blackshear crames said 
during the bankruptcy case laventhol will attempt to determine 
its total liaiblities including claims made in lawsuits he said 
crames said he could not estimate what those liabilities would be 
in its bankruptcy filing laventhol said it owed 146 million to 
various creditors its two largest are chase manhattan bank and 
fidelity bank which are owed 85 million crames said but its 
actual liabilities will be much higher he said 
laventhol which had 50 offices nationwide said most of its 
annual income came in the tax season of januaryapril these banks 
provided credit that helped laventhol meet its cash needs the rest 
of the year 
laventhol also faces a lawsuit over its auditing of jim bakkers 
ptl ministry that case is on trial in charlotte nc 
since laventhol is a partnership not a corporation its current 
and even retired partners could end up paying out of their own 
pockets to settle claims if laventhol cant come up with enough 
money 
partners may find themselves on the hook for work that the 
firm did while they were employed there crames said 
laventhol said it thinned its payroll as it entered its credit 
crunch leaving about 3200 employees in addition to the partners 
and principals as of this month it had domestic revenue of 350 
million last year 
laventhol also said it sought to merge with several other major 
accounting firms but had no offers

economic factors contributed to prime minister 
margaret thatchers downfall though reforming the economy was one 
of the hallmarks of more than 11 years of thatcherism 
during her tenure at 10 downing st mrs thatcher relentlessly 
promoted capitalism to defeat socialism in britain 
she took over from the previous labor government a troubled 
economy that was suffering from 17 percent interest rates and moved 
deep into recession while inflation climbed to 18 percent 
mrs thatcher tamed militant labor unions reformed taxes and 
cut many inefficiencies out of british industry her efforts helped 
produce an eightyear economic boom the longest in britain since 
world war ii during which interest rates fell to 75 percent 
inflation got down to 33 percent and unemployment went from 113 
percent to 55 percent 
but her hostility toward european economic and monetary union 
her unpopular percapita community charge or polltax and the 
downturn in the economy made her vulnerable to the attack on her 
leadership of the conservative party 
to guard british sovereignty she said she wouldnt abolish the 
pound to make way for a single european currency or relinquish 
monetary control to a european central bank but other 
conservatives and many britons worried about being left behind in 
the european economic revolution 
the poll tax which went into effect earlier this year was 
unpopular enough to also divide her party and spark riots 
the tax was intended to make local government authorities 
accountable for their spending but it condemned for having no 
relationship to the taxpayers ability to pay 
the economic downturn has been accompanied by 14 percent 
interest rates 109 percent inflation and huge trade deficits 
unemployment at 6 percent has been climbing 
the government had pushed interest rates higher leaving them at 
15 percent for a year to fight the resurgent inflation by cooling 
demand 
demand had overheated because of loose monetary policy designed 
to improve the conservatives electoral prospects in 1987 and to 
avoid a recession following the stock market crash in october of 
that year 
high interest rates have hurt industry and profits and britain 
is suffering record business failures the rates also have squeezed 
britains new homeowners who generally hold adjustable rate 
mortgages 
the persistent bear market on the stock exchange meanwhile has 
hurt some 9 million britons who have become new shareholders 
asked about mrs thatchers accomplishments economist kevin 
darlington of the london investment firm ubs phillips and drew 
said the true test will be whether the underlying economy is 
strong enough to cope with the current recession 
mrs thatcher said in the house of commons thursday that her 
government had improved the standard of living in britain 
this past week she said that one of her main achievements was 
creating a culture of enterprise that oversaw the restructuring of 
britains overmanned inefficient industry into a leaner more 
competitive one 
the major accomplishment i think must be the enormous surge 
in british productivity the change in management attitudes she 
got rid of slack management and the weakening of union power 
said john barnes who teaches government at the london school of 
economics 
at least part of the 11 12 years in office she succeeded in 
beating inflation barnes said the generation of small business 
was also a thatcher accomplishment he said 
through largescale privatization that has been copied around 
the world mrs thatcher deregulated utilities turned nationalized 
companies such as british airways into worldclass competitors and 
more than tripled british share ownership 
britains financial markets also were deregulated under the 
socalled big bang which opened securities trading to banks and 
foreign traders in 1986 
she tamed britains militant unions with legislation that 
required them to ballot workers before they go on strike and union 
membership has declined substantially to 84 million from 12 
million in 1979 
mrs thatcher also promoted home ownership by selling public 
housing to its tenants 
she cut and simplified taxes over the years she brought the 
basic income tax rate to 25 percent from 33 percent and nearly 
halved the top rate to 40 percent from 83 percent 
she put a tight grip on public spending and tried to break a 
british dependence on welfare thus she turned the budget deficits 
into the surpluses 
the prime minister also encouraged entrepreneurship trying to 
turn britain from a classdivided society into a meritocracy some 
400000 new businesses have been created since 1979 she said

prime minister margaret thatchers resignation 
thursday was bittersweet news for britains business community and 
financial markets 
they were sorry to see mrs thatcher go because her staunch 
freemarket policies have transformed british industry during her 
11 years in power 
but they were relieved that she stepped aside to improve the 
capitalist conservative partys chances of defeating the socialist 
laborites in the next election which must be called by mid1992 
they were dismayed that more than one new leadership contender 
stepped forward raising doubts about the conservative election 
changes and fueling fears that the leadership battle would be 
prolonged 
some traders were cheered that chancellor of the exchequer john 
major was one of two new candidates believing the treasurys top 
official could help turn britains ailing economy turn around 
foreign secretary douglas hurd also said he would challenge 
michael hesletine the former defense minister who won enough votes 
last tuesday to force a second ballot next tuesday and prompt mrs 
thatcher to step down 
traders said mrs thatchers announcement caught the financial 
community like most everyone else offguard especially after her 
determined statement wednesday that she would fight on 
but kevin darlington a british economist with the london 
investment firm ubs phillips and drew said there was not the 
kind of fallout in the stock market or sterling that might have 
been expected because the worst already has been anticipated 
the pound and share prices soared when news of her resignation 
broke in the morning then fell back after hurd and major emerged 
before the noon deadline for nominations 
the market is going mad in relief said peter furlong 
senior british equities dealer at daiwa securities 
one buoyant factor during the day was widespread speculation 
that the conservative government would launch the new postthatcher 
regime with a quick halfpoint cut in britains 14 percent 
interest rates 
the strong pound would allow an interest rate cut without 
risking sterlings position in the european exchange rate 
mechanism which links european currencies and limits exchange rate 
swings 
the decision to cut base rates has almost certainly been taken 
already said steven bell senior economist at morgan grenfell 
and co 
the pound finished the day at 19695 after rising as high as 
198 it closed at 19680 wednesday 
the british currency also finished at 29118 german marks after 
rocketing to 29315 marks the wednesday late rate was 29122 
marks 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index finished 16 
points or 008 percent higher at 21279 the session high which 
came right after the resignation news was 21607 a gain of 344 
points 
andrew ellott a corporate dealer with chase manhattan bank in 
london said the market was optimistic about the next election 
when thatcher resigned 
then we had two new people come into the election who in my 
view are mrs thatchers proteges i think that will very much 
split the vote with heseltine 
darlington said there will be enormous uncertainty over the 
next week it looks increasingly likely that it the leadership 
battle will go to a third ballot next thursday 
one would expect a kind of paralysis to take hold in the 
markets he said 
some equities and foreign exchange traders predicted that the 
financial markets bullish reaction would be shortlived because 
the markets longerterm wouldnt be able to ignore britains 
underlying economic troubles 
one analyst said the economic facts are still the same the 
economy isnt running smoothly inflation is too high 
inflation is running at 109 percent although the economy is 
shrinking 
but the business community was quick to express its regrets at 
mrs thatchers departure 
sir brian corby president of the confederation of british 
industry said british business today is unrecognizable in the 
quality of its management the revival of its investment in the 
future and in its ability to compete in the toughest markets 
throughout the world 
much of the credit for that historic turnaround belongs to the 
prime minister corby said 
british midland airways chairman michael bishop said he was 
extremely sorry about the resignation mrs thatcher had been the 
catalyst which had helped his company expand he said

new owners of the exercise equipment 
firm nautilus are trying to muscle their way back from bankruptcy 
court with a pitch to older folks that they can benefit from 
pumping iron 
were going to go at the competition from a position of 
strength and with a lot of new products said nautilus president 
dan baldwin baldwin has returned to the company he helped founder 
arthur jones build from 1974 to 1986 
travis ward of dallas bought the company in 198 for 38 million 
and filed for bankruptcy protection in february after four years of 
management turnovers and increasing debt and overhead 
retail sales of nearly 60 million in 1985 plummeted and the 
work force of 600 that year dropped to 250 in 1990 baldwin said 
baldwin while not giving the exact amount said sales of 
nautilus exercise machines have tripled since august when he and a 
group of wellfinanced investors bought the company in bankruptcy 
court for 15 million 
the company is designing weight machines for the elderly that 
will be lighter and easier to get into and out of and it is 
expanding its focus to people over 45 whose concern is shifting 
from their grown children to their own bodies 
if we can just get the message across to these people they 
need more exercise than anyone else said baldwin grayhaired 
but trim at 57 ronald reagan is a good example of what 
weightlifting can do 
reagan used nautilus equipment in the white house when he was 
rehabilitating from his gunshot wound 
baldwin who can still yank bank an entire stack on the curl 
machine personifies the push to beat the lull in the economy by 
expanding the market base to middleaged and elderly people 
the privately held firm is negotiating to buy a company that 
makes aerobic equipment such as treadmills exercise bikes and 
rowing machines or enter a joint venture with one baldwin said 
industry experts credit nautilus second wind to its name 
recognition and its reputation they said the company helped 
pioneer the movement that brought physical fitness out of the 
locker room and into health clubs hotels and office buildings 
they are a symbol for the industry club industry magazine 
publisher marc onigman said 
nautilus is trying to capitalize on its brand name by licensing 
it for bottled water sports apparel and a soft drink being 
testmarketed by dr pepper 
to help sell the new ideas baldwin has hired one of the worlds 
largest advertising agencies saatchi and saatchi and a madison 
avenue public relations firm 
most companies come out of chapter 11 very conservative 
john saunders the vice president for sales and marketing said 
this company is stronger today and better capitalized and better 
managed than at any point in history 
the new line of weight machines with unique shielding to cover 
moving parts was shown last week at a national trade show in 
chicago 
people were pleasantly surprised by the presence nautilus had 
at the show onigman said the message was clear theyre 
coming back with a vengeance 
but baldwin conceded that it has been more difficult than he 
anticipated to rehabilitate the company which listed a debt of 
386 million and assets of 273 million when it filed for 
reorganization in bankruptcy court 
baldwin declined to say what the companys debt and assets are 
now 
a new york market research firm findsvp puts industry sales 
at about 250 million this year in 1988 the research firm 
estimated that universal gym was the industry leader with sales of 
30 million and nautilus was second at 20 million 
onigman said the fitness industry leery of the recession is 
watching closely to see if nautilus can regain its former strength 
there are a lot of disciples of nautilus out there he said 
nobody likes to see a hero fall even people that compete with 
nautilus

barren slopes in europe and slowing traffic at 
us resorts have put a chill in ski equipment sales and 
manufacturers face another potential rut in the soggy economy 
industry officials say 
i think everybody is concerned said david ingemie 
president of united ski industries association a group 
representing resorts and manufacturers in the past the ski 
industry has been recession resistant but youre never sure 
even before this years season opened ski makers saw an inside 
threat as industry giant salomon sa a powerful force in 
bindings and boots edged into the market with a new line of skis 
combined with the slower business it helped fuel a stir in the 
ski industry which is offering all sorts of bargains and hightech 
equipment to bring more people into the port 
figures compiled by the ski association reflect the sluggish 
times facing the industry in the 198990 season us resorts 
recorded 50 million skier visits a 6 percent drop from the year 
before prior to then skier traffic had been flat for a couple of 
years 
officials say the situation has been more bleak in europe which 
has been plagued by little snowfall 
also the drop off at ski lift lines has had a ripple effect in 
the equipment industry 
if fewer people are going out skiing they will tend to 
purchase less equipment said marvin kottke a retired university 
of connecticut economist who conducts annual studies of the ski 
industry 
us equipment sales increased last season by 2 percent to 675 
million but industry experts say that was explained by higher 
prices the number of skis sold for example declined by 3 percent 
to 11 million pairs 
this year the equipment industry is bracing for another threat 
in the sagging us economy the economic troubles have hit 
particularly hard in new england home to many major resorts 
still ski area operators are optimistic saying their biggest 
concern is not the economy but the weather 
at the retail level diehard skiers will still buy new 
equipment which can cost up to several hundred dollars said chris 
leake vice president of merchandising for ski market ltd which 
operates a chain of stores in the northeast 
but most people are saying i think ill make my boots last 
another year ill make my skis work another season he said 
i think it would be crazy to think the lack of confidence in 
the economy has no impact on the ski business said stuart 
rempel a marketing and communications executive for salomons us 
headquarters in georgetown which is about 30 miles from boston 
nonetheless salomon based in france has introduced a ski this 
year that the company spent five years and 40 million to develop 
rempel said the ski has a unique design that gives skiers more 
control and more speed 
the new line is targeted for toplevel skiers and the company 
is making no concessions to what might be a tight market each pair 
of its skis will cost a whopping 595 
that high price could cause some problems given the current 
economic slump leake said 
potentially salomons timing is poor he said but added 
theyve made a major commitment salomon isnt making skis for 
one year 
in fact salomon plans to introduce a lower level of 
recreational skis next year rempel said our intention is to be 
a major force in skis he said 
this strategy is not lost on other ski makers salomon already 
dominates the world market in bindings with a 45 percent share 
according to rempels estimates and is vying for the top spot in 
boots 
if i was a competitor id be nervous said ingemie at the 
ski industries association 
rossignol sa a world leader in the ski market has come out 
with its own new skis this year which also incorporate significant 
technological improvements to make turning easier said 
jeannemarie gand a company spokeswoman 
you cant sit back on your laurels she said adding that 
the french company next year will introduce another incredible 
line of skis 
still she said companies are working harder to make skiing a 
viable activity for people facing tight budgets some resorts 
are offering special family rates and free skiing for beginners to 
attract more people 
rossignol is working with some resorts and retailers to offer 
customers free lift tickets if they buy a pair of skis 
we see much more of that this year she said

avon has come calling with a chinesestyle sales 
approach for its beauty supplies 
instead of knocking on doors in the american tradition avon 
salespeople in china will use the timehallowed chinese custom of 
working through personal contacts 
the first selling job avon faced in china was with chinese 
officials according to john novosad vice president for the 
asiapacific region of avon products inc 
the first thing we heard was whats direct selling 
novosad said wednesday in a telephone interview from his hong kong 
office they had great difficulty understanding why we thought 
this was a good idea but we convinced them 
avon through a joint venture with the guangzhou cosmetics 
factory then began selling beauty products this month in the 
southern chinese city of guangzhou also known as canton the 
company has 25 sales supervisors all chinese who have recruited 
about 800 people to sell the beauty supplies on a commission basis 
novosad said 
we expected to have to spend a lot of time teaching these 
people about profit incentive and the selling methods novosad 
said youre talking about a country that we all believe doesnt 
know about these things well it wasnt that way the first 
question we heard was how much commission do i get 
avon which already sells its products in more than 100 
countries is selling skincare supplies perfumes cosmetics and 
personal hygiene items in china they will be made in china with 
imported ingredients 
the companys traditional image in the united states is of an 
avon lady ringing doorbells and spending leisurely afternoons 
with her customers 
here were telling the representatives to build networks 
talk to their sisters talk to those they work with and so on 
there are no limits so it can be done doortodoor if they feel 
comfortable or it can be done by taking brochures to work it 
depends on the ingenuity 
novosad said avon will test the method in guangzhou before 
trying other parts of china 
avon supervisors receive a base salary but also get a 2 percent 
to 6 percent commission on the sales of the representatives they 
recruit novosad said the salespeople will receive a 25 percent 
commission on their sales he said 
we think it will work here and let us develop a base for all 
of china china once it gets economically going will be a 
fabulous market of tremendous proportions novosad said we 
dont expect to make millions at first 
prices for the avon products sold in guangzhou average about 3 
thats onetenth the average monthly income of a chinese worker 
but guangzhou workers are generally better off than those elsewhere 
in the country customers are most likely to be single young women 
who tend to have relatively high disposable incomes

kevin paxton has worked at the teledyne cae 
plant for more than 10 years he says he was a company man who took 
pride in his work as a tool and die maker 
but when the 35yearold father of two thinks of teledyne these 
days he feels mostly anger and bitterness over a 10month strike 
that has cast a pall over the holiday season 
you do a good job for the company and you want to continue on 
but they seem like they just dont care that hurts i mean i feel 
like my legs have been kicked out from under me paxton said 
wednesday 
a local grocery store gave away more than 100 turkeys this week 
to the striking employees to help them through thanksgiving 
local 12 which also represents workers at the toledo jeep 
plants has started a program called adopt a teledyne family 
union members are being encouraged to give presents and other help 
to teledyne families with children 
paxton said most of the 130 members of united auto workers local 
12 who went on strike in february feel that the walkout has gone on 
for too long teledyne hourly employees walked off the job after 
working eight months without a contract at the manufacturer of 
engines that power military missiles 
a federal mediator is involved but no new talks have been 
scheduled and the company has hired some replacement workers 
a telephone message that a reporter left at the companys 
offices was not immediately returned 
workers at four other teledyne plants in the united states also 
are on strike 
david bosworth president of the unions teledyne unit said the 
union wants the company to continue paying health insurance to 
employees after they retire 
in addition teledyne wants to cap cost of living increases for 
workers who earn 1350 an hour it also is seeking job 
description changes that would allow some positions to be combined 
union members receive 100 a week in strike pay some members 
have wives who work others have had to dip into their savings to 
support their families 
i know of families that are hurting real bad members of this 
unit never expected to be on strike this long i thought wed have 
it over by now bosworth said 
the mood was somber at a meeting wednesday where workers 
listened to the latest news about the strike and picked up food 
donated by other unions 
i wish i had some good news but i dont have any bosworth 
told more than 100 workers

japan the united states and europe have laid the 
groundwork for a joint development of intelligent future 
manufacturing technologies negotiators said 
this is the first time that this many countries have been 
represented in discussions about advanced manufacturing and how 
they can collaborate a us negotiator said were very 
pleased with the amount of progress we made 
as proposed by japan the project would develop and set 
standards for future technologies such as computercontrolled 
flexible factories that could shift products with a simple change 
in software programs 
a lack of standards in such technologies would make competition 
among suppliers difficult and complicate procurement for 
manufacturers especially at overseas plants 
the three sides agreed in talks this week in tokyo on basic 
principles for the project called the intelligent manufacturing 
system but did not set any concrete plans the officials said 
us officials said they now will explain the outcome of the 
talks to american industry and seek its consensus on how to 
proceed 
if it is the feeling of industry to go ahead the next step 
would be to actually negotiate an agreement for the first phase 
of the program said a member of the us delegation who briefed 
reporters on condition of anonymity 
japan originated the project and offered to fund about 60 
percent of its cost partly in response to charges that it has used 
foreign technology but contributed too little to world scientific 
knowledge more than 80 japanese companies and a number of american 
firms have expressed interest in the program 
but at a meeting in may us and european officials balked at 
adopting japans plan and demanded that preparation and control of 
the project be shared some us business and government officials 
also accused japan of planning to use the project to acquire us 
technology and dominate future global manufacturing 
the degree of skepticism has been reduced as a result of the 
dialogue the us official said he said most us proposals 
were accepted by japan and the european community during the 
twoday discussions which ended tuesday 
the united states europe and japan each have different 
strengths if we select themes that will be of benefit to each of 
the participants the result can be satisfactory to all said 
katsujiro kida director of the industrial machinery division of 
japans ministry of international trade and industry 
by advancing manufacturing technology this will create a body 
of knowledge that will profit all humankind he said 
the us official said it was unfortunate that american industry 
waited until japan took the initiative in calling for research in 
manufacturing technologies but we should take advantage of this 
opportunity 
us negotiators said they see the project as a broad umbrella 
under which many groups of researchers can work on a variety of 
projects 
although research topics have not been selected japanese 
officials envision standardized technologies that would allow 
factory computers and robots to communicate much more extensively 
factory machines would be linked directly with sales offices parts 
suppliers and accounting departments 
an order entered in an auto dealers computer for example 
could automatically instruct computers at parts suppliers and 
factories to adjust assembly line robots at the appropriate time to 
produce a customized car and enter the transaction in the firms 
books
