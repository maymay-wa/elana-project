a program sunday on 
governmentrun television accused the us news media of bias 
hostility and missionary zeal in its reporting on south africa 
the 30minute south african broadcasting corp program said the 
us media focused only on violence and blackwhite confrontation 
ignoring positive developments 
the program included interviews with officials from such us 
groups as the heritage foundation the american enterprise 
institute and the hoover institution 
no journalists working for american news organizations in south 
africa appeared on the program 
the american media simply are not going to give a fair shake 
to south africa said william rusher publisher of the 
conservative us journal national review 
program narrator cliff saunders said many foreign television 
organizations dash into south africa shoot a documentary in 
frantic haste then dash home to tell a story which in no way 
reflects insight into the south african situation 
the three largest american televison networks abc nbc and cbs 
all have permanent bureaus in south africa 
but ignorance and haste are only part of the problem 
saunders said outright bias hostility and a missionary zeal to 
discredit south african conditions are widespread 
the program did not cite any inaccuracies reported in the us 
media and mentioned only two american news organizations by name 
cbs and abc 
it showed brief footage from black townships that appeared in 
the cbs documentary children of apartheid the program aired 
in december 
minister of home affairs stoffel botha called the cbs program a 
blatant distortion that should be condemned with the contempt it 
deserves 
botha and his department monitor the south african and foreign 
news media under the nationwide state of emergency in effect since 
june 1986 
the restrictions prevent journalists from reporting 
disturbances security force actions and most forms of protest 
all of the americans interviewed agreed that the media crackdown 
has reduced us television coverage of south africa 
the government has been remarkably effective in pushing south 
africa off the us evening news said stanford ungar a 
professor at american university in washington

president corazon aquino said sunday 
she has no intention of allowing former president ferdinand e 
marcos to return to the country 
i just want our people to know and to reassure them that i 
will never do anything that will go against the interests of the 
filipino people mrs aquino said during her weekly radio program 
ask the president 
she was responding to two women callers who said they were 
disappointed that she had sent emissaries early this year to meet 
with marcos 
marcos has been living in hawaii since his regime toppled by a 
february 1986 revolt that swept aquino to power 
one of the women said she was disappointed because of reports 
that government representatives were negotiating with marcos for 
his possible return mrs aquinos spokesmen had earlier denied the 
reports 
marcos told reporters in honolulu last week that negotiations 
with mrs aquinos government were continuing and he was told he 
could return in two months to act as government adviser 
mrs aquino said she sent two of her relatives to meet with 
marcos last january and february because she had heard his health 
was really deteriorating very fast and that he had a message 
for her 
my directions to my relatives were very clear just to 
listen to what mr marcos had to say mrs aquino said never 
did i say that he could come back or that i wanted him to advise me 
and help me find the solutions to our problems 
i think you also heard me say in the past that many of our 
problems were caused in fact by mr marcos the president added 
government officials have said mrs aquino does not want marcos 
to return because his followers still are capable of plots to 
destabilize the government 
meanwhile two gunmen fatally shot a bodyguard of the mayor of 
suburban makati early sunday outside the mayors home police said

interfere were the npa referring to the communist new peoples

jesse jackson said sunday he would be 
willing to talk with those holding us hostages in lebanon and 
suggested that he would be more effective in winning their freedom 
that would his democratic presidential rival michael dukakis 
the reagan administration has refused as a matter of policy to 
negotiate with hostagetakers jackson said he would be willing to 
talk to anyone including the kidnappers 
in this world in this ambiguous world you must not set up 
preconditions that stop effectiveness jackson said at a rally in 
washington i would meet with anyone i could meet with to get the 
hostages out of beirut 
jacksons remarks came in the final weekend of the pennsylvania 
primary campaign as he and dukakis set aside their bestfriends 
campaign style dukakis rejected as absurd jacksons suggestion 
that he offer specific budget figures for programs he favors 
both candidates sounded jobs themes as they campaigned in this 
industrial state dukakis talked about steel industry jobs and 
economic development during a whistlestop train trip through the 
western half of the state 
jackson spent the night with an unemployed steelworker and his 
family in aliquippa preached at a local church and met with 
paperworkers in lock haven before flying to washington 
dukakis is considered a sure bet to win most of the 178 
democratic convention delegations at stake in the pennsylvania on 
tuesday jacksons best chance to make an impression would be in 
the nonbinding preference vote that also will be part of tuesdays 
ballot 
with 78 republican delegates also at stake vice president 
george bush should reach the 1139 total he needs to clinch the gop 
presidential nomination with a majority of the delegates to the 
republican national convention in august in new orleans 
vote 12 times for mike dukakis said fliers being 
distributed to democratic voters in the states 2nd congressional 
district that appeal was not an invitation to vote fraud but an 
effort to help voters understand the long and complex ballot that 
will confront them tuesday 
democratic voters will elect delegates identified as supporters 
of dukakis or jackson for republicans the task is even more 
difficult since the ballot will not identify the presidential 
preference of delegate candidates 
the dukakis campaign was spending 25000 on radio commercials 
that begin 
on april 26 in the pennsylvania primary one vote for mike 
dukakis wont be enough if you want to help send mike to the white 
house youve got to vote for all the dukakis delegates in our 
area 
the jackson campaign also was distributing fliers explaining to 
voters what they must do to support the former civil rights 
activist 
jacksons delegate strength is concentrated in philadelphia and 
pittsburgh where the vast majority of the states black voters 
live dukakis is expected to win most of the delegates in other 
parts of the state 
meanwhile democrats in the us territory of guam decided 
sunday that its six delegates representing three votes at the 
national convention will remain uncommitted in an attempt to have 
more political clout 
the idea behind our uncommitted stance was to allow the guam 
delegation to discuss guam issues so more people could become aware 
of what we want daryl taggerty vice chairman of the partys 
delegate selection committee said sunday following the partys 
caucuses 
the guam delegation includes former territorial gov ricardo j 
bordallo who was convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for 
government contracts but remains free pending appeal in federal 
courts 
while dukakis and jackson battled for democratic delegates in 
pennsylvania conservative republicans were trying to influence 
bushs selection of a running mate 
curt clinkscales a conservative activist has formed an 
unauthorized committee to raise money to promote former un 
ambassador jeane kirkpatrick as the gop vice presidential candidate 
mark salter a spokesman for mrs kirkpatrick said she 
believes the decision on the vice president should be solely that 
of vice president bush 
the former un ambassador a favorite of conservatives because 
of her hardline views on foreign policy briefly considered getting 
into the presidential race but finally decided against it 
clinkscales said he has raised 100000 and collected the names 
of 1400 volunteers 
through most of the pennsylvania campaign dukakis and jackson 
avoided any criticism of each other concentrating instead on bush 
and the reagan administration 
their niceguy approach was strained slightly saturday night 
when they debated in pittsburgh and jackson chided dukakis for 
failing to attach price tags to his proposals 
im not just for head start im willing to pay for head 
start jackson said during the debate i have put numbers 
together to pay for my dreams 
after the debate jackson said dukakis had failed to answer 
the budget question i know its good to project for a national 
health care plan which i support but it will cost 
i dont know what hes trying to do dukakis said sunday 
when asked about the pressure from jackson to come up with budget 
figures 
you cant prepare a budget now for next year he told 
reporters on his campaign train thats absurd 
on the hostage question jackson criticized dukakis stance that 
terrorists should not be negotiated with 
ive raised the point in several debates this year jackson 
said every time a question comes up about terrorism mr dukakis 
says im against terrorism we should not negotiate with 
terrorists in the middle east never negotiate with terrorists be 
tough 
i disagree with that jackson went on if i could get 
those hostages out i would bring them back home 
he said making a deal with kidnappers would be no worse than 
dealing with the likes of panamanian strongman manuel antonio 
noriega 
we say now if noriega will come out of panama well send him 
to another country thats a concession but the fact is the 
object must be to free americans who are held hostage in the middle 
east 
nine americans are believed held by kidnappers in lebanon they 
are terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press thomas sutherland frank herbert reed joseph 
james cicippio edward austin tracy jesse turner robert polhill 
alann steen and marine lt col william r higgins 
jackson spent saturday night with 35yearold doug cafrelli and 
his wife and five children after working 13 years at ltv steel 
cafrelli was laid off in 1985 
he said he got a call saturday asking if hed be willing to have 
jackson as a house guest for one night 
i was in a daze in a dream he said 
the next morning jackson sat with mr and mrs cafrelli at the 
kitchen table in their twostory frame house and had a breakfast 
scrambled eggs bacon and sausage then he preached at the local 
methodist church

william weld one of two top justice 
department officials who recently resigned says federal laws 
should be revised to make it easier to charge state and local 
public officials with corruption and to include congress members 
under all anticorruption laws 
weld who resigned march 29 as head of the justice departments 
criminal division said in the opinion section column in the 
washington post on sunday that he would not discuss the reasons for 
his departure after two years in the department led by embattled 
attorney general edwin meese iii 
he wrote that the nation greatly underrates public corruption as 
a political and economic problem in the united states and said that 
corruption is a weed that will grow fast if left unattended so 
legislation at the federal level is necessary 
i for one believe that the federal government must take an 
active role in the fight against public corruption at all levels 
he said 
at a white house meeting on wednesday weld and resigning deputy 
attorney general arnold burns painted a picture of a crippled 
department and an attorney general wracked by legal troubles 
according to sources familiar with the halfhour meeting with 
president reagan 
sources said weld told the president that if it were up to him 
he would seek an indictment against meese who has been the subject 
of a lengthy investigation by an independent counsel 
in the washington post column weld said there must be a federal 
anticorruption law to overcome the effects of last years supreme 
court decision which limited the ability of federal prosecutors to 
charge local officers with abuses of public trust 
another welcome step would be to apply all existing 
anticorruption statutes to members of congress he said noting 
that only members of the executive branch and independent agencies 
are prohibited from supplementing their salaries with fees and 
honoraria for jobrelated activities 
weld said he found attractive the proposal to raise the salary 
of all members of congress to between 150000 and 175000 while 
prohibiting all honoraria 
one big gain would be ruling out the possibility that fees or 
honoraria would influence a legislators sense of priorities let 
alone his or her vote weld wrote moreover if members did not 
have to scramble to suport their families and two residences they 
would have more time to devote to the publics business 
those higher salaries might also attract to the national 
legislature at least some able women and men who would not 
otherwise be able to make the sacrifice he said we should 
cleanse the system so as to attract them

five years after a searing report called a 
nation at risk warned that american education was sinking beneath 
a rising tide of mediocrity education secretary william j 
bennett says we are still at risk 
bennett in a new report said after five years of education 
reform efforts and higher spending the nations public schools 
have improved only marginally the boston herald reported sunday 
too many american students are not now getting the education 
they deserve bennett wrote in the study requested by president 
reagan he said student achievement continues unacceptably low 
the administration will mark the fifth anniversary of a nation 
at risk on tuesday at the white house when bennett will give 
president reagan his own assessment of how the schools are 
performing 
the bennett report said 56 billion more has been spent on 
public schools over the past five years and while there has been 
some progress the improvement is at a disappointingly slow pace 
and still at excessively low levels of achievement 
the education secretary lashed at teacher unions and other 
education organizations saying their narrow selfinterested 
exercise of political power threatens school reform efforts 
whenever a worthwhile school proposal or legislative 
initiative is under consideration those with a vested interest in 
the educational status quo will use political muscle to block 
reform he wrote 
bennett added and too often the antireformers succeed if 
our schools are to improve that power must be overcome 
the national education association will mark the anniversary 
with a protest tuesday in lafayette park across the street from the 
white house the union president mary hatwood futrell has charged 
school reform is withering on the vine due to lack of federal 
funds an nea flyer promoting the rally bears the headline 1983 
a nation at risk 1988 an administration asleep 
the first wave of school reforms involved topdown efforts by 
states to mandate stiffer course requirements and to impose tougher 
licensing requirements on teachers the stick of accountability was 
often coupled with the carrot of big pay increases teacher 
salaries have climbed 35 percent since 1983 from an average of 
20693 to roughly 28000 
more recently the push has been toward bottomup reforms aimed 
at giving local teachers and school administrators more freedom to 
chart their own path toward better schools 
a 1986 carnegie task force laid the groundwork for creating a 
private nonprofit national board for professional teaching 
standards but it is still several years away from figuring out how 
to recognize outstanding teachers 
bennett proposes a common academic curriculum for all students 
more difficult course content and more challenging instruction in 
the lower grades and for minority and disadvantaged students he 
also suggests changes in state rules to allow those without 
education degrees to become teachers and school principals 
some experts echo bennetts criticism that school reforms have 
had little impact on the worst problems 
according to the education commission of the states 45 states 
and the district of columbia have raised graduation standards since 
1980 in 1987 the average high school student had to take nearly 
20 units of credit to graduate up from 17 in 1980 
but such groups as the carnegie foundation for the advancement 
of teaching and the committee for economic development have 
concluded school reforms have had little or no impact on urban 
schools 
the committee for economic development led by top business 
executives said recent reform efforts have largely bypassed the 
problems of the educationally disadvantaged the 30 percent of 
children facing major risk of educational failure and lifelong 
dependency 
the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching said 
last month the harsh truth is that the reform movement has 
largely bypassed our most deeply troubled schools it said such 
prescriptions as more homework more testing and more requirements 
for graduation were irrelevant to many children largely black 
and hispanic in our urban schools 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said theres no evidence that reform is working for 
any of our kids except for maybe the 20 percent who have always 
made it in the traditional school system 
bill honig californias superintendent of public instruction 
offers a far more upbeat view of what has happened since a nation 
at risk 
honig said california students are scoring higher on the 
scholastic aptitude test as well as state exams and thousands more 
are taking three years of math and science california students 
passed 41000 college board advancement placement exams last year 
up 73 percent from 1984 
it has worked for many kids in inner cities theyre taking 
harder courses said honig and there has has been no jump in 
dropout rates as some had feared 
im not saying were anywhere near where we have to be but 
were on the right track said honig 
the original nation at risk report was the work of the 
national commission on excellence in education a panel of 18 
citizens appointed by thensecretary of education th bell in 
august 1981 to address the widespread public perception that 
something is seriously remiss in our educational system 
the commission headed by university of california president 
david p gardner called its provocative report an open letter to 
the american people 
the educational foundations of our society are presently being 
eroded by a rising ride of mediocrity that threatens our very 
future as a nation and a people it said 
if an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on 
america the mediocre educational performance that exists today we 
might well have viewed it as an act of war 
the commission recommended a longer schoolyear competitive 
performancebased salaries for teachers and minimum high 
school graduation standards of four years of english three years 
each of math science and social studies and a halfyear of 
computer science 
the commission members but not bell all have been invited to 
the white house for tuesdays ceremony 
bell in his memoirs the thirteenth man accused reagan of 
neglecting school reform after the 1984 election in a recent 
interview bell said were doing a better job of educating the 
top 60 to 70 percent but weve made no progress with respect 
to this bottom 3040 percent the dropouts minorities 
the big push for school reform didnt do a darn thing to solve 
that

afghan rebels stormed and captured a 
strategic sovietafghan garrison and opened a new direct supply 
route for weapons rebel spokesmen said saturday 
they said the garrison at barikot in afghanistans northeast 
kunar province fell friday at 1 pm after a fourmonth siege 
shortly before that helicopters airlifted about five infantry 
and commando battalions including a handful of soviet advisers 
from the installation the rebels said 
in kabul president najib confirmed sunday that guerrillas had 
captured the post but he refused to call it a defeat he 
characterized it as a change of positions of the army forces 
the capture is a major victory for the anticommunist guerrillas 
fighting the sovietbacked government it opens a new supply route 
over the pakistani border for us chinese and other western 
weapons 
the guerrillas said the operation was led by commander 
rahmatullah of the hezbiislami khalis faction 
rahmatullah sent a radio message to guerrilla headquarters in 
pakistan saying the transmission was coming from inside barikot 
before being airlifted communist forces blew up a major 
ammunition dump inside the garrison apparently to reduce the 
guerrillas war booty the spokesmen said 
they said soviet and afghan jetfighters made highaltitude 
bombing raids while helicopter gunships escorted transport copters 
in and out of the garrison 
dozens of houses were destroyed in the air raids 
one report said the garrison and a neighboring village were 
still being bombed saturday afternoon 
rebel spokesman qariburahman saeed said sovietafghan forces 
were trying to destroy barikot rather than let it remain in 
guerrilla hands 
he said 17 rebels had been killed and 16 wounded in the 
operation but had no casualty figures for sovietafghan troops 
the attack on barikot garrison is one of a dozen major military 
operations carried out by the guerrillas against the kabul 
government since the united states the soviet union pakistan and 
afghanistan signed an agreement in geneva april 14 to withdraw an 
estimated 115000 soviet troops from afghanistan 
the guerrillas who were not direct party to the accord have 
vowed to continue fighting until the communist government is 
overthrown the soviets intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 
barikot lies just inside the afghan border with northern 
pakistan for the guerrillas the capture of barikot would open a 
major supply route from pakistans border town of arando to 
afghanistans northeastern province of nuristan and kunar arando 
is separated from afghanistan by the kunar river 
pakistan is a staging area for the afghan resistance although 
islamabad has pledged in the geneva accord to stop serving as an 
arms conduit when the agreement goes into effect on may 15

an iranian gunboat rocketed a saudi 
arabianowned tanker in the strait of hormuz sunday hours after 
president reagan warned iran to stop attacking neutral ships in the 
region persian gulf shipping sources said 
the tanker which sustained minor damage made for the southern 
port of dubai with an unexploded rocket hanging from its punctured 
site but the captain said that the missile fell overboard when the 
tanker docked he reported no explosion 
gulfbased shipping executives speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the 37011ton sea trader was approached by a swarm 
of six gunboats as it sailed northward through the strait gateway 
to the gulf but they said only one iranian boat took part in the 
attack 
the tankers indian skipper capt br pagarkar reported that 
his ship was only slightly damaged with no casualties among his 
indian crew the officials said 
the shipping officials quoted pagarkar as saying he saw six 
speedboats heading in his direction as the tanker was entering the 
gulf to take on a cargo of oil at the saudi port of ras tanura 
five then went in one direction while one appeared to be 
heading for another tanker and i thought wed escaped an attack 
but suddenly it veered toward my ship pagarkar said 
the iranians demanded the sea traders destination and were 
preparing to board when suddenly they began firing with 
shouldercarried guns they must have fired 10 to 12 rockets the 
captain said 
i had no fire and no injuries and so when i saw that i didnt 
require assistance i just proceeded he said 
the tanker flies a liberian flag but is owned by the bakri 
navigation co of jiddah 
reagan warned saturday that further iranian attacks on shipping 
will be very costly to iran and its people 
the raid was the first iranian attack on a neutral merchant ship 
since monday when iranian gunboats attacked several vessels during 
a series of clashes with the us navy last monday 
the battles began when the us warships blasted two offshore 
iranian oil platforms the americans said also were used as bases 
for iranian attacks on ships in the socalled tanker war a 
spillover from the 7yearold iraniraq war 
the navy also disabled two iranian frigates and sank or disabled 
four other armed iranian vessels 
the platforms were hit in what the united states termed a 
measured response for damage to the guided missile frigate uss 
samuel b roberts when it hit an iranian mine april 14 
ten of the frigates crewmen were wounded by the mine blast in a 
channel used by the us navy to escort usflagged commercial 
vessels to and from kuwait 
us officials have disclosed that american warships in the gulf 
will now be allowed to go to the aid of neutral vessels under 
attack previously the navy was not permitted to intervene in 
raids on nonamerican vessels 
however spokesmen for the us defense department and the white 
house said they knew of no us intervention sunday to help vessels 
under attack in the gulf

proiranian shiite moslem extremists 
threatened sunday to kill two american hostages if us warships in 
the persian gulf launch new attacks on iranian targets 
the threat was contained in a handwritten statement signed by 
the revolutionarey justice organization and delivered to the beirut 
office of a western news agency 
revolutionary justice holds joseph james cicippio 57 of valley 
forge pennsylvania and edward austin tracy 57 of burlington 
vermont 
they are among the 22 foreign hostages held in lebanon 
the conservative addiyar newspaper reported earlier sunday that 
a deal to free three french hostages held by another shiite faction 
fell through when the kidnappers reneged on pledges to release them 
because the hijackers of a kuwaiti airliner were still in algiers 
kuwaiti officials said when the algerians negotiated an end to 
the 16day hijack drama wednesday the shiite hijackers left the 
plane on condition they were given safe passage to another country 
sundays revolutionary justice statement was accompanied by a 
photograph of cicippio the acting comptroller at the american 
university of beirut who was kidnapped sept 12 1986 
any new us aggression under any pretext or excuse will 
lead to the execution of spy edward tracy first and cicippio 
secondly the arabiclanguage statement said 
another western news agency received a photocopy of a membership 
card of an unidentified lebanese organization bearing tracys 
photograph to authenticate the statement 
tracy a writer of childrens books was kidnapped oct 21 1986 
the attacks occurring in the gulf will not go unpunished and 
will not be as easy as america assumes and defines the beginning 
and the end of the aggression the letter said 
the letter said that if us attacks continued one option would 
be to move the battle arena to inside america after which things 
will get out of control it did not elaborate 
the us navy disabled two iranian frigates and sank or disabled 
four other armed iranian vessels in the persian gulf last monday 
us officials said the attack was in retaliation for the mine 
strike on an american navy frigate that left 10 crewmembers injured 
president reagan warned saturday that further iranian attacks on 
neutral shipping will be very costly to iran and its people 
us officials have disclosed that american warships in the gulf 
will now be allowed to go to the aid of neutral vessels under 
attack previously the navy was not permitted to intervene in

a judges decision to give defendant albert 
hakim access to classified documents in the irancontra case 
spotlights the dilemma of ensuring a fair trial while protecting 
the nations secrets 
since hakim has never been granted a security clearance us 
district judge gerhard a gesells recent decision made clear that 
fairness takes precedence over normal security rules in a criminal 
trial 
the judge gave all four defendants access to 300000 classified 
documents to prepare for trial although anyone in the case faces 
stiff penalties for unauthorized disclosure of material in the 
documents 
but hakims case is the best example of the problem because his 
background is so different from those of the other defendants 
oliver l north john m poindexter and richard v secord all 
are former military men with wide experience in handling secret 
documents and covert operations 
but hakim is a businessman of iranian heritage who told the 
irancontra congressional committees as a businessman i never 
pretended to undertake these activities for philanthropic 
purposes 
jerry rubino director of security for the justice department 
said it does present a problem whenever we cant do traditional 
background checks for security clearances 
rubino said he cant recall any previous case where such broad 
access to classified information was granted to someone without a 
clearance normally he said the indictment makes it 
inappropriate to say this person is trustworthy 
the irancontra indictment alleges a broad conspiracy to misuse 
a lawful presidential order allowing the secret sales of arms to 
iran 
the conspirators are accused of using money from the sales to 
aid the nicaraguan contra rebels when such assistance was banned 
to generate illegal profits for private gain and to cover up their 
activities 
north was a national security council staff member his boss was 
former national security adviser poindexter secord is a former air 
force major general turned private businessman and hakim was 
secords business partner 
as an nsc staffer north generated many of the classified 
irancontra documents that he will see in the case so did 
poindexter who routinely briefed the president on national 
security matters and therefore had vast knowledge of the nations 
secrets 
secord who became norths key private sector operative had 
held sensitive pentagon jobs he once was in charge of 
international security matters and reportedly helped plan an 
unexecuted pentagon mission to iran in 1980 when 52 americans were 
held hostage at the us embassy there 
e lawrence barcella jr a former assistant us attorney in 
washington who specialized in antiterrorism prosecutions said 
reagan administration officials probably are very edgy about 
letting hakim see it the classified information 
but he added the problem is that was the choice the 
independent counsel knew about before he indicted him 
the government has decided on occasion against bringing charges 
in some espionage or antiterrorism cases so it wouldnt risk 
disclosure of classified information barcella said 
but far worse for the government was graymail a form of 
blackmail used by those threatening to expose classified 
information if indicted 
congress answer was passage in 1980 of the classified 
information procedures act which sets up rules for handling 
classified information in criminal trials 
the law allows the judge to take swift retribution against 
unauthorized disclosures by finding a violator in contempt and 
jailing him or her immediately 
in return for the swift contempt penalty that protects the 
governments information the defense is assured the access it 
needs to present its side 
the act was structured to equalize the status of a defendant 
regardless of whether he has a security clearance said allan 
adler a legislative counsel of the american civil liberties union 
no one should have an advantage what congress intended was 
that a criminal defendants right to a fair trial should not 
be impaired by the fact that information relating to the charges is 
classified 
the act requires the defendant to notify the court and the 
prosecution if it plans to use classified documents in the case 
the court has discretion to work out alternative procedures that 
could keep the documents secret while allowing the trial to 
continue 
for instance there could be a government statement admitting 
relevant facts that the specific classified information would tend 
to prove there could be a summary of the information 
and if a defendant is prevented by the judge from using 
classified information he needs for his defense the court has 
three choices it can dismiss the indictment in whole or in part 
strike certain prosecution testimony or rule against the 
prosecution on any issue where the information would be relevant

the passage of marylands new law banning 
cheap handguns stems in part from an epidemic of drugrelated 
killings but it also owes a lot to a state senators embarrassment 
at a washington party 
what embarrassed state senate president thomas v mike miller 
also made him a center of attention and that led to a meeting with 
a woman who is a driving force in the move for gun control 
legislation 
millers secretary misread an invitation to a gridiron club 
event last year as saying white attire was required instead of 
white tie so miller was the only one who showed up in a white 
tuxedo 
he was approached by sarah brady wife of presidential press 
secretary james brady who was severely injured in the 1981 
assassination attempt on president reagan 
it was unbelievable recalled miller there i was 
redfaced standing 15 feet from president reagan and sarah brady 
comes over and tries to make me feel at ease she told me i was the 
only thing adding any pizazz to the party 
they met again a few weeks ago when mrs brady who has become 
active in the fight for gun control legislation asked for millers 
help in pushing a bill that would outlaw the sale and manufacture 
in maryland of cheap handguns commonly known as saturday night 
specials 
i was impressed with her and when i was given the opportunity 
to help it was the least i could do for her he said 
the law which gov william donald schaefer has promised to 
sign will require a ninemember state board to draw up a list of 
acceptable handguns those not on the list would be banned in 
maryland and violators would be liable for stiff fines up to 
10000 for each illegal gun sold or manufactured 
the ban wont go into effect until january 1990 giving the 
national rifle association a chance next year to try to have it 
repealed nra officials have vowed to make such an attempt 
while four other states have laws that ban cheap guns based on 
the melting point of a weapons metal the maryland measure is 
considered by its supporters to be much broader they hope it will 
be used as a model by other states 
gun control advocates also see the maryland experience as a 
useful political primer in how to withstand the powerful nra 
miller was absolutely crucial said del peter franchot one 
of a cadre of lawmakers who pushed the bill through the house of 
delegates 
he just stood up for the guncontrol bill and stared down the 
nra franchot said we just sat back there in awe at the way 
miller pushed the thing through we would have been nowhere without 
the political muscle of the president 
miller acknowledged the role played by mrs bradys personal 
lobbying but said a more important factor was the attitude of the 
nra itself 
the very fact that they were opposed to banning guns that 
could go past metal detectors turned off a great many 
legislators he explained the fact that they were opposed to 
banning tin and plastic guns that sell for 2995 whose sole 
purpose is to kill that told the general assembly of maryland that 
they werent interested in a reasonable compromise 
agreeing with that analysis was michael beard director of the 
national coalition to ban handguns the nra i think just blew 
it they were too arrogant 
miller franchot and beard also agreed that the recent rash of 
shootings by teenagers hooked into the drug trade in baltimore and 
metropolitan washington was a crucial factor 
credit also was given to effective personal lobbying by coretta 
scott king wife of slain civil rights leader martin luther king 
and other victims of violence 
ted lattanzio the nras director of state and local affairs 
cited those and other factors for creating an emotional 
hysteria that made passage possible 
it was a concerted effort by the governor other political 
leadership guncontrol groups and the media that steamrolled an 
unfortunate law which deludes the public into thinking it will 
have an impact on crime which it wont lattanzio said

the arab uprising has cast a shadow over 
israels yearlong 40th anniversary bash with american director 
woody allen poet allen ginsberg and tennis ace chris evert among 
celebrities who turned down invitations 
israeli organizers hope to stem the wave of cancellations by 
assuring reluctant guests that the arabisraeli conflict will be a 
central theme and that they are free to criticize israel 
some israelis consider the noshows another slap in the face to 
a nation that throughout its short history has often found itself 
isolated and a target of international criticism 
but others said they wont let it spoil the party 
you have seen the people of israel truly rejoice going out 
for picnics going out into the streets said prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs aide avi pazner referring to last weeks 
independence day celebrations nobody can take that away 
organizers said many big names remained on the guest list 
including american movie director robert wise and indianborn zubin 
mehta conductor of both the new york and israel philharmonic 
orchestras 
israeli organizers had planned an impressive lineup of poetry 
readings film festivals and theater performances as highlights of 
israels 40th anniversary celebration 
but in the midst of preparations the arab uprising erupted five 
months ago and televised images of israeli soldiers clubbing arab 
youths and razing houses sparked an international outcry more than 
170 arabs and two israelis have died in the unrest 
we are in a war and it hurts everything our celebration our 
economy tourism our feelings said yakov agmon the chief 
coordinator of the anniversary festivities 
agmon suffered a major setback last week when five israeli poets 
organizing one of the main events the international poetry 
week withdrew their support and called on fellow artists to 
boycott the june festival 
a government that demolishes civilian houses and kills 
youths in what can only be termed state terror is not worthy to 
have poets come to a governmentsponsored festival said natan 
zach a founding father of modern hebrew poetry who lives in haifa 
agmon initially wanted to cancel the festival but then asked 
his staffers to poll the invited poets 80 israelis and 35 
foreigners to see if there was enough support to go ahead he 
said he would make a decision later this month 
he would not give names of poets who turned down invitations 
but two of the most prominent ginsberg and soviet poet yevgeny 
yevtushenko said they would not attend 
ginsberg said in new york he initially accepted hoping to use 
the festival as a protest for peace but later withdrew in 
solidarity with zachs decision 
organizers of other festivals also said many international 
artists were torn about whether to attend 
we got a lot of letters from film directors who said how can 
we come to israel and talk about movies when people get murdered 
said nili miller spokeswoman for the weeklong international 
student film festival scheduled for may 
ms miller said organizers had asked 150 film schools to submit 
contributions and 45 accepted while 50 of the refusals cited 
political reasons 
to overcome such reservations organizers decided on a 32hour 
retrospective of films on the arabisraeli conflict which has 
become the centerpiece of the festival 
as a result several prestigious contributors including the 
london international film school agreed to attend they now have 
a feeling that theyre not just coming to talk about art but to 
get involved ms miller said 
but others like allen turned down the invitation allen did 
not give a reason but ms miller suggested his refusal was 
politically motivated earlier this year allen who is jewish 
sharply criticized army policies in a letter to the new york times 
ms evert and fellow tennis star brad gilbert pulled out of a 
may tennis benefit tournament for jerusalems shaare zedek hospital 
ms evert decided to withdraw mainly because of the political 
problems said hospital spokesman rami sadan who canceled the 
tournament 
some entertainers have chosen another way 
theatre du soleil a parisbased avantgarde troupe agreed to 
attend this summers israel festival an annual performing arts 
extravaganza after telling organizers it would first publish a 
statement about its political views in israeli newspapers 
in the halfpage ad published april 15 in the jerusalem post 
newspaper the group described the arab uprising as justified but 
also asserted israels right to exist in peace and security 
pazner said he opposed attempts to encourage political debate to 
assuage the liberal conscience of vips 
it is wrong to turn a national celebration into a political 
event pazner told the ap the israeli people want to rejoice 
without politics 
he lashed out at local artists criticizing israel calling them 
a small minority of pseudointellectuals who believe selfhatred 
is the answer to the problems of the jewish people 
countered zach he is probably right if he means by 
selfhatred that we are having problems with our conscience

the assassination of the plos no 2 leader 
may have been aimed at scuttling middle east peace efforts and a 
breakdown could lead to a disaster king hussein said in a rare 
interview broadcast sunday 
hussein condemned the april 16 killing in tunisia of khalil 
wazir military head of the palestine liberation organization 
which he said was more than likely carried out by israel 
israeli sources have said israel was behind the attack but the 
government has not confirmed it 
i think it will probably mean that tensions in the area will 
grow more and conceivable it could be an action in itself which is 
aimed at creating the kind of reaction that would destroy the 
chances for progress towards peace hussein said on nbcs sunday 
today 
sticks and stones and tear gas are causing a lot of damage 
but this area has nuclear weapons within it he said if 
there is no solution the end is an explosion a disaster i 
could see a disaster overtaking all of us sooner or later 
palestinian rioting in the west bank which israel captured from 
jordan in the 1967 middle east war and in the israelioccupied 
gaza strip taken from egypt in the same conflict has left more 
than 170 arabs and two israelis dead 
hussein in the interview taped thursday also said the united 
states is not doing enough to promote peace 
when asked if he trusted the united states as mediator he said 
i have no reason to do so so far its not a question of trust 
its a question of is the united states willing to assume the

it was the doomsday that didnt happen the 
october stock market collapse instead of ushering in a recession 
or worse has been almost a nonevent as far as the us economy is 
concerned 
at least thats the opinion of many economists who have been 
watching with amazement as a string of economic statistics have 
shown betterthanexpected growth this year 
employment gains have pushed the jobless rate down to a 
nineyear low consumer spending especially for autos has been 
robust and american manufacturers are enjoying booming export 
sales 
it wasnt supposed to happen this way right after oct 19 many 
analysts feared that the record 508point drop in the stock market 
would spell 1929 all over again 
after a loss of a trillion dollars in wealth nervous consumers 
would stop spending manufacturers caught with huge inventories of 
unsold goods would cut back production and lay off workers that 
would push the unemployment rate up and further erode consumer 
confidence 
the result according to those postcrash forecasts a recession 
starting in the first quarter of 1988 a scenario with ominous 
implications for republican hopes of keeping the white house 
but many economists believe that instead of declining the 
overall economy as measured by the gross national product rose at 
a respectable annual rate of 2 percent or better from january 
through march the government will provide the first official look 
at the gnp on tuesday 
so what went right 
in the view of economists the simple answer is that employers 
instead of cutting back on hiring after the stock market crash 
actually boosted hiring 
in the six months since the market crash an average of 362000 
new jobs have been added each month more than twice the size of 
the average monthly employment gains before the crash 
the thing that saved the country were those huge gains in 
employment said michael evans head of a washington forecasting 
firm and one of the analysts predicting a recession in the 
aftermath of the stock crash 
after the crash you would have thought that employers would 
have thrown on the caution light at least for a few months but 
instead they stepped up their hiring and that boosted consumer 
confidence evans said 
analysts admit they are somewhat puzzled about why employers 
went on a hiring binge especially since unsold goods were piling 
up at an alarming rate in the final three months of the year 
one factor that kept us hiring strong they believe was that 
much of the rise in inventories represented imported goods 
therefore cutbacks in new orders hurt foreign producers not 
american manufacturers 
in addition us export sales remained strong helped out by 
the weak dollar the reagan administration is counting on a robust 
export sector to provide almost half of the increased economic 
growth expected this year and so far that optimism appears 
warranted 
the export boom has kept the economy going said robert 
dederick chief economist of northern trust co of chicago we 
are beginning to see secondary benefits as businesses producing at 
highcapacity rates boost their investment spending 
another factor analysts cite for keeping the economy going was a 
rebound in car sales in recent months as automakers reintroduced 
incentive programs to get buyers back into the showrooms 
but analysts say none of these things would have helped without 
the spectacular rise in employment which pushed the jobless rate 
down to a nineyear low of 56 percent in march 
the key was employment it stayed strong and that gave 
consumers confidence to keep spending especially for bigticket 
items said david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp 
co a government securities dealer since the consumer is 
twothirds of our economy that made the difference 
the rebound in consumer spending has brought on a new worry 
however that demand might be so strong that inflation is 
reignited many economists believe that the federal reserve 
tightened up on credit slightly in march as a way of cooling off 
demand and keeping the economy from overheating 
while interest rates have edged up slightly in recent weeks 
economists are not looking for any dramatic move by the fed to 
boost rates quickly especially during an election year 
with the strong gains in employment through march many 
economists have been revising their growth forecasts for the year 
the blue chip economic indicators a financial newsletter said 
that twothirds of the 51 top economists it surveys each month had 
boosted their overall growth forecasts for 1988 
the consensus estimate now puts gnp growth for all of 1988 at 
27 percent substantially above the 19 percent growth being 
forecast immediately following the market crash the reagan 
administration is calling for 29 percent gnp growth this year

one highlight on this years agenda is wednesdays panel 
discussion on the state of inner cities featuring los angeles

racism the problems of the black middle class crime in the black 
community minority hiring and promoting black business ventures

decline she said right now they black administrators

a presidential commission has handed the 
festering ailments of the nations air travel system back to 
congress which tried but failed to address the problem last year 
with public complaints peaking about safety chronically delayed 
and canceled flights lost baggage and confusing fares a showpiece 
bill to protect passengers was pieced together but got bogged down 
in the 1987 session 
prospects for a new legislative effort are uncertain even in 
light of last weeks urgent call by the presidents aviation safety 
commission for decisive action 
the commissions report urged lawmakers to create a new safety 
czar within the federal aviation administration and to give the 
faa more clout by removing it from the department of transportation 
the commission also suggested that the faa be freed from 
cumbersome government rules that hinder its ability to efficiently 
purchase modern equipment and deploy its air traffic controllers 
and other employees in addition the agency should beef up its 
2000strong force of inspectors and become more aggressive in 
examining the nations airlines and smaller carriers the report 
said 
now is the time for decisive action by congress and the 
executive branch the commission said noting that air traffic is 
expected to continue its rapid growth 
a bill introduced last year would make the faa an independent 
agency and give it more authority to marshall its own forces that 
legislation is likely to be modified to accommodate some of the 
commissions recommendations 
sen wendell ford dky one of the bills chief sponsors and 
chairman of the senate aviation subcommittee had lined up a total 
of 50 other cosponsors by late last week he hopes his panel can 
write the measures final version next month 
complaining in a recent interview of political regulation of 
the faa by the transportation department ford said the faa 
people need some independence so they can go out and do the things 
they think should be done 
but opponents question whether altering the relationship between 
two federal agencies on a bureaucratic flow chart will have much 
effect on how safely and quickly airline passengers can get from 
one city to another 
some say the plan would leave the faa without needed oversight 
allowing the agency to develop too cozy a relationship with the 
industry it is supposed to regulate 
i think the faa sees the world through aviators goggles 
said jim burnett chairman of the national transportation safety 
board the agency that investigates transportation accidents i 
think the effect of this legislation is an industryrelief bill 
industry groups support an independent faa but deny that it 
will be an agency they can easily influence 
it remains part of the executive branch it remains part of 
government said edward stimpson president of the general 
aviation manufacturers association which represents private plane 
builders 
but important members of congress involved in aviation matters 
remain unconvinced 
sen ernest hollings dsc chairman of the commerce 
committee which oversees the aviation subcommittee said that when 
it comes to an agencys clout its smarter to have that voice at 
the cabinet level 
added rep norman mineta dcalif chairman of the house 
aviation subcommittee i dont see the independence of the faa as 
the solution to their major problems 
the commissions suggestion that a powerful safety czar be 
established at the faa along with a new committee to oversee 
safety regulations was met with raised eyebrows in congress and 
seems unlikely to be approved 
thats discombobulation thats not fixing things up said 
hollings 
in addition to opposition the proposals face congress has a 
shortened schedule this year with time off for campaigning that 
makes action even less likely 
some of the commissions recommendations can be implemented by 
the faa and transportation department without congressional action 
such as stepping up inspections of airlines 
the senate and house each passed bills last year that would 
force the airlines to issue detailed monthly reports on late and 
delayed flights and other problems the legislation has gone 
nowhere however because negotiators from the two chambers cannot 
agree on whether the bill should also contain new drugtesting 
requirements 
john m albertine the business executive who headed the safety 
commission remains optimistic that congress will act this year 
there is a sense in the publics mind that there are problems 
in the system that have to be fixed said albertine a onetime 
congressional staff aide when there is that strong a sense in 
the publics mind around here people begin to pay attention

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs economic 
reform program ran into problems last year and things arent likely 
to improve in the near future us intelligence agencies said in a 
report released sunday 
unless gorbachev can do something to turn the economy around he 
may find himself in trouble said the bleak review which was 
conducted jointly by the central intelligence agency and the 
defense intelligence agency 
tension within society and the leadership will increase it 
said bureaucrats will become increasingly frustrated by loss of 
privileges and status and by demands that they show greater 
initiative military leaders are likely to become more and more 
uneasy if benefits from the industrial modernization fail to 
materialize 
soviet citizens will need to see some improvement in living 
standards if the regime is to achieve necessary gains in worker 
productivity and avoid widespread discontent the study said 
the report concluded that failure to head off these tensions 
would at a minimum make it more difficult to pursue his economic 
program vigorously and could ultimately call into question his 
strong political position at home 
gorbachev and supporters of his reforms have acknowledged 
resistance at the highest levels and there have been reports in 
moscow of conflict over reform measures between gorbachev and no 2 
kremlin leader yegor k ligachev 
criticism of the slow pace of gorbachevs reforms earlier led to 
the firing of boris n yeltsin as moscow communist party boss 
the us intelligence study was presented april 13 to the 
congressional joint economic committee and a declassified version 
was released by the panel 
the study is the annual review of the soviet economy three 
years after gorbachev came to power he inherited an aging 
extremely inefficient economy and made its modernization one of his 
top priorities the study noted 
after some early success gorbachevs ambitious program to 
create a modern more dynamic soviet economy ran into trouble in 
1987 the study said 
familiar problems with poor weather and transportation 
bottlenecks were compounded by the disruptions caused by the 
introduction of economic reforms it said 
the soviet gross national product the total value of all goods 
and services produced grew only 5 percent last year the study 
noted that rate was reminiscent of the late brezhnev period 
it said referring to leonid brezhnev a gorbachev predecessor who 
prevailed over a largely stagnant economy in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s 
the study noted that the soviet gnp grew by 39 percent in 1986 
the first full year of gorbachevs term compared with 6 percent 
in 1985 
by contrast the us gross national product grew 29 percent 
both in 1986 and 1987 however the american economy measures a 
much larger base and comparisons are difficult 
the soviet economy was hampered by bad weather last year 
particularly in agriculture where output fell three percent the 
study said 
but industrial quality control measures also proved to be 
particularly disruptive especially early in the year thus 
industry only grew 15 percent and the civilian machinebuilding 
sector didnt grow at all 
the real loser in 1987 appeared to be the consumer who now 
three years into gorbachevs economic program has seen almost no 
increase in his standard of living the study said 
it also said that for a variety of reasons the shortterm 
outlook for gorbachevs economic program is not good 
among those reasons are confusion about guidelines for 
selffinancing reforms deficiencies in 1987 machinebuilding that 
will slow the speed of modernization transportation problems and 
poor prospects for improved worker productivity 
gorbachev also needs to be better organized the study concluded 
although gorbachevs program is comprehensive it is in some 
respects inconsistent particularly with regard to timing for 
example his goals for an immediate acceleration in the growth of 
national income and a pronounced improvement in the quality of 
output are in our view fundamentally incompatible 
in addition his plan to change traditional economic planning 
and administrative procedures dramatically has been thrust upon a 
largely unprepared bureaucracy the study said

demonstrators threw a firebomb at a 
governing party candidate and two dozen people were arrested 
sunday politicians made lastminute appeals for support in 
tuesdays legislative elections 
the nations 130000member national police force went on full 
alert in a routine move to provide security sunday the 18th and 
final day of official campaigning for the national assembly 
elections 
the balloting is the first test of public confidence in the 
government of president roh taewoo since he was inaugurated on 
feb 25 after his win in decembers presidential vote 
about 200 people who left an opposition rally held a sitin at 
myungdong cathedral in downtown seoul where they shouted down 
with roh taewoo 
the protesters marched in the streets after dark prompting 
police to use tear gas about 20 people were taken away by police 
in the southeastern city of taegu police arrested four students 
for hurling a firebomb at a government party candidate who was 
making a speech during a joint rally 
even before the police alert went into effect officers were 
deployed in force throughout the country to minimize violence at 
campaign rallies scattered incidents marred some rallies in recent 
days 
police said 147 people had been booked so far for violating 
election laws of those detained only 12 were put under formal 
arrest and the rest were set free they said 
at stake in tuesdays elections are 299 seats 244 of which are 
decided by popular vote with the remaining 75 seats allocated to 
parties in proportion to the total popular vote they receive 
after the opposition split and lost the presidential vote 
opposition parties are struggling to make a strong comeback in the 
legislative elections their efforts are hampered by internal 
divisions 
all election surveys by local newspapers indicated president 
rohs democratic justice party would easily win a majority in the 
assembly 
we aim only for 55 percent of the seats party chairman chae 
moonshik told reporters denying predictions the governing party 
would sweep the elections 
opposition parties rejected chaes statement as a smoke screen 
accusing the government of planning to rig the elections and win at 
least twothirds of the seats 
opposition leader kim daejung said in seoul that the roh 
government would face catastrophic public resistance if it 
tries to win the elections through fraud 
i have clear evidence that the government is planning to buy 
off votes with all sorts of illegal means including cash kim 
told 100000 people who gathered at the threehour rally at yoido 
plaza 
in the southern port of pusan the nations second largest city 
another opposition leader kim youngsam sharpened his criticism 
of the government also charging fraud 
if the djp emerges as a big party through fraud the roh 
government will be doomed and our politics will once again plunge 
into chaos kim youngsam told reporters 
kim youngsam and kim daejung have come under fire since they 
divided the opposition vote in the december presidential election 
roh won only a 366 percent plurality

united technologies corp and the government 
of israel are quietly lobbying the state department for an export 
permit that would allow the defense contractor to help israel 
design an airlaunched armorseeking weapon system 
us officials so far have refused to issue the company the 
necessary license saying that the system would violate a sixyear 
ban on the sale of cluster bomb technology to israel 
the companys lobbying effort is outlined in a feb 4 memo from 
united technologies to edward derwinski under secretary of state 
for security assistance science and technology defense week a 
washington publication reports in its issue dated monday that top 
israeli officials also have been lobbying for the utc license 
in the memo from cr bergwin director of export license 
administration for hartford connbased united technologies the 
company argues that the ban should not apply to the 50 million 
contract 
in order that we may proceed with the program we urgently 
require an interpretation that the us governments cluster 
munition policy does not apply to our contract bergwin wrote 
he said the company believes that the 1982 ban was aimed at 
cluster bombs designed to be used against people not against tanks 
and armored vehicles 
bergwin also argued that the united technologies contract should 
not be subject to the ban because our limited engineering 
participation in this program has nothing to do with the warhead 
portion of the system 
israel hired the company to design the nose wing and control 
modules of the weapon system the contract was under utcs norden 
systems in norwalk conn but has been transferred to the 
corporations advanced systems division in san diego a source told 
the associated press 
the white house imposed the cluster bomb ban on israel in 1982 
after evidence surfaced that the devices were used by israel 
against civilians during its invasion of lebanon an apparent 
violation of assurances israel had previously given us officials 
but israeli officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
told defense week that the proposed weapon was much different from 
a traditional cluster bomb 
conventional cluster bombs spread scores of bomblets 
indiscriminately while the weapon under development would dispense 
no more than 10 submunitions that would seek out individual armor 
targets such as tanks they said 
but tankseeking weapons that miss their primary target dont 
turn into potted plants one pentagon official told defense week 
they sense large metal objects like school buses and can cause 
civilian casualties 
the newsletter said us officials likely would approve the 
export permit if israel signs a proposal submitted two years ago by 
the state department that would detail how israel could use such 
weapons but israel does not want to sign the agreement 
a state department spokeswoman reached over the weekend declined 
comment 
united technologies said in a prepared statement its a 
classified israeli program and therefore we cannot comment

sloppy repairs drunkenness and nepotism are 
rampant at the chernobyl nuclear plant two years after the worlds 
worst nuclear disaster pravda said sunday 
the communist party daily said engineering jobs at the plant 
were handed out to medics teachers veterinarians and people 
without any higher education 
it also accused chernobyls managers of trying to resolve at 
any cost obstacles to full electricity production at the plant 
to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance of 
extremely intricate equipment 
the scathing attack was a departure from the numerous articles 
appearing in the soviet press before tuesdays anniversary of the 
april 26 1986 explosion and fire at the power plant 80 miles 
north of the ukrainian capital of kiev 
the explosion killed 31 people spewed radiation around the 
world and forced the evacuation of 135000 soviets living near the 
plant 
the previous stories have stressed the extensive safety 
equipment installed at the plant improved worker training the 
decrease to safe levels of radiation and the return of people to 
surrounding areas 
pravda began by reporting safe radiation levels at the plant and 
the production of 21 billion kilowatthours of electricity there 
since the accident 
but then the focus turned to criticism by the kiev regions 
communist party committee of kombinat the organization 
supervising the plant and cleanup around it 
plant equipment was repaired without technical supervisors and 
was not tested before being put into service despite serious 
defects the newspaper said it said other problems caused the 
grossest violations of sanitary standards 
some safety measures planned on the reactor no 4 at the plant 
were not carried out because of kombinats negligence pravda said 
that reactor in which the explosion occurred has been sealed in 
concrete laden with radiation sensors other official reports have 
stressed the danger from the no 4 reactor has been neutralized 
leadership posts were given to people who had criminal 
records who had been excluded from the party or had received 
strict party penalties pravda said 
units were headed by people not able to cope with the business 
they were entrusted with medics teachers veterinarians and 
people not having any higher education were working in engineering 
posts pravda said 
discipline was slack the newspaper said 
in the kombinat amalgamation drunkenness thievery and 
violations of labor discipline have not been reduced it said 
pravda did not say whether any corrective action had been taken 
other than to report that kiev party leaders reprimanded kombinats 
head and indicated he had been fired 
e ignatenko displayed liberalism and political immaturity in 
the evaluation of the lack of discipline multiple violations of 
organizational and financial discipline protectionism nepotism 
moral breakdown of leaders the paper said 
the party leaders also reprimanded the chernobyl plants 
director 
judging from all this the leadership of kombinat has not 
learned a lesson from the past pravda said its as though 
there hasnt been an accident 
the article indicated that managers tolerated the shortcomings 
because of a widespread problem in soviet industry pressure to 
fulfill a production plan 
the government has said it must increase the production of 
nuclear power plants to meet the countrys electricity needs the 
chernobyl plant with two of its four reactors now operating has 
been ordered to generate 199 billion kilowatthours this year 
hints of problems at the plant first came in december v 
lukyanenko the communist party head in slavutich a new town for 
plant workers near chernobyl told a newspaper that sloppy work 
poor discipline and safety violations at the plant contributed to 
36 accidents over a 10month period three of them fatal 
yuri k semyonov deputy head of the chernobyl cleanup 
commission denied at a moscow news conference wednesday that any 
major accident or deaths occurred at the plant since the 1986 
explosion

through a translator at muen church more than 100 years old 
the mostly elderly congregation listened attentively some 
nodding at times in agreement one elderly man sitting in the 
balcony held up a sign with a bright red cross and god loves the 
world written in chinese 
you are known and prayed for throughout the world said 
graham who has preached in nearly 70 countries he arrived in 
china on april 12 for a 16day tour 
the pure heart church also was filled to overflowing with about 
1500 people when graham spoke there sunday evening 
about 50 people sat on stone benches in the church courtyard and 
listened to loudspeakers that broadcast grahams sermon which 
discussed the ways jesus christ described himself to his followers 
the muen church was built by methodists in 1887 however 
protestant denominations no longer exist in china all having been 
united under the official china christian council 
like all other churches and religious institutions in china it 
was closed during the radical leftist 196676 cultural revolution 
when all religious activity was banned the muen church was 
reopened in 1979 and its two sunday morning services regularly 
attract a total of about 3000 worshipers

an unauthorized jeane kirkpatrick for vice 
president campaign has garnered 100000 and 1400 volunteers in 
less than four months but is unlikely to win a blessing from the 
former un ambassador herself 
the independent draft movement was the brainchild of curt 
clinkscales founder of a controversial senior citizens lobbying 
group owner of a direct mail firm and director of the kirkpatrick 
effort 
since january he and other kirkpatrick aficionados have been 
testing the grass roots through direct mailings and petitions 
circulated at state republican conventions 
we have found that she is enormously popular its just been 
incredible clinkscales said this will show the vice president 
george bush that the ideal selection is jeane kirkpatrick 
kirkpatrick a georgetown university professor and a fellow at 
the american enterprise institute declined to be interviewed on 
the subject but she said through a spokesman that she has no 
connection with the clinkscales effort and does not want one 
she believes the decision on the vice president should be 
solely that of vice president bush the expected gop nominee 
said mark salter the spokesman 
clinkscales a direct mail expert and former member of the 
executive committee of the national conservative political action 
committee doesnt disagree with that but he says hes hoping to 
create such a groundswell for kirkpatrick that bush wont dare 
choose anyone else 
frankly without this effort i dont think dr kirkpatrick 
would be given serious consideration for the nomination he said 
with it i think she will get it 
bush spokesman pete teeley predicted that the clinkscales 
initiative would not be the first lobbying effort on behalf of one 
vice presidential possibility or another 
mrs kirkpatrick is wise in not becoming involved in this 
operation and she is correct in her statement that it is the vice 
presidents choice he will make that after a lot of 
consideration teeley said 
these efforts are sometimes embarrassing to the people that 
theyre allegedly designed to help he added theres just 
something really unseemly about trying to force somebody onto a 
ticket to throw them forward in an effort they havent 
sanctioned themselves 
in his letter to potential contributors clinkscales wrote that 
kirkpatricks widespread popular support convinced many party 
officials to begin this independent draft effort i agreed to serve 
as campaign director to help make 1988 a milestone year for freedom 
everywhere 
however asked in an interview whose idea it was to start a 
draftkirkpatrick campaign clinkscales replied it was mine 
he said his company clco inc has sent out 400000 letters in 
weekly waves that started last jan 28 
clinkscales said his suppliers are making money from the 
campaign but he and his company are not he said the effort is 
selfsustaining supported by donations from the people who get the 
letters 
in addition to running clco clinkscales is national director of 
the archconservative national alliance of senior citizens which 
he founded in 1974 
the group has opposed medicare expansions including the 
catastrophic health insurance bill pending in congress and 
supported candidates who favor freezing social security 
costofliving adjustments it compiles a congressional ratings 
list based on diverse issues and has consistently rated at zero or 
close to it rep claude pepper dfla usually considered a 
champion of elderly causes 
in 1986 the alliance was involved in a controversy when it sent 
out more than 100000 letters to us physicians and pharmacists 
defending a popular arthritis drug called feldene which was under 
attack by ralph naders health research group the letter made no 
mention of it but the mailing was paid for by the drugs 
manufacturer pfizer inc a corporate sponsor of the alliance

former first lady rosalynn carter has 
joined the debate over the filming of the movie union street 
here 
local veterans organizations have criticized the movies star 
actress jane fonda because of her visit to north vietnam during 
the vietnam war and say she is not welcome in town 
in a letter that was published in fridays editions of the 
waterbury republicanamerican mrs carter said fonda was not alone 
in strongly objecting to the vietnam war 
it is true fonda was a militant objector during the vietnam 
war and did things of which i strongly disapproved mrs carter 
said however it is good for us to realize that millions of 
americans young and old strongly opposed some of the actions of 
our government during the conflict 
mrs carter said fonda has since expressed regrets about the 
methods she used to oppose the war and has supported the cause of 
vietnam veterans 
ours is a nation whose principles permit us citizens to 
express differences of opinion even to criticize publicly our own 
government mrs carter said my hope is that those who still 
condemn fonda and would deprive her of the right to practice her 
profession are a small minority and that other citizens of 
waterbury will speak up for the right of free speech in our 
country

young women spoke about their lives as groupies fans who are 
obsessed with rock stars one woman claimed to have had sex with 
about 2000 musicians he said

they are an odd couple the cool technocrat 
from massachusetts and the fiery preacher from the civil rights 
movement rivals they still are but michael dukakis and jesse 
jackson have become friends as they have survived to the endgame of 
the democratic nomination wars of 1988 
we like each other and we respect each other dukakis tells 
crowds we may differ on some issues but if we do it is in the 
spirit of friendship 
politicians often say they like each other or are friends when 
there is little there but political necessity and practical 
relationships but aides to both candidates say the dukakisjackson 
relationship is getting stronger and more personal day by day 
it is a relationship nutured in private talks and public 
positions the two meet on the campaign trail most often at 
debates 
this weekend in debates in philadelphia and pittsburgh there 
was much laughter and smiling and banter as they talked of their 
agreement on the issues and little about their disagreements 
its been growing and it is very positive said ann lewis a 
jackson adviser of the developing relationship between the two 
candidates lewis said the twoweek new york battle was a key to 
the friendship as both men avoided negative campaigning 
the two also talk by phone at least once a week the loser 
calling to congratulate the winner wednesday morning after each 
primary 
theyve been through the same grueling experience together 
this campaign added dukakis aide leslie dach thats gives 
them a lot in common 
in the next few weeks and months their relationship may be the 
single most important one for the party and its hopes for winning 
back the white house in november 
dukakis is the frontrunner with a growing lead jackson the 
black leader who excites crowds like no other politician today 
how dukakis deals with jackson and his supporters will determine 
in large part their commitment to the democratic ticket in the fall 
how do we channel the enthusiasm in that community rep jim 
florio dnj asked dukakis at one philadelphia campaign stop as 
they talked of the fall campaign 
thus the dukakis aversion to negative campaigns and his need 
for jacksons help dovetail nicely 
yes i want to win but this is going to be a positive 
campaign dukakis said in aliquippa pa 
we both happen to be very positive people dukakis told a 
labor rally saturday morning in philadelphia we both understand 
that there is one overriding goal in this campaign and that is to 
win in november 
dukakis dealings with jackson will shape many voters 
perception of what kind of a leader this massachusetts governor 
really is 
in 1984 democratic nominee walter mondales failure to deal 
effectively with jackson in his first bid for the nomination helped 
create the perception that mondale was a weak leader who pandered 
ineffectively to the key black voting bloc in the party 
this year there were reports that dukakis and jackson did not 
get along particularly well reports that both camps say were 
exaggerated or wrong 
the relationship improved after super tuesday as jackson was 
gracious in his victory in michigan and finishing ahead of dukakis 
in illinois dukakis in turn was gracious in accepting defeat and 
pushing on to the next state 
dukakis resisted all pressure to be sharply critical of jackson 
even after sen albert gore jr went dramatically negative against 
jackson in a desparate effort to revive his candidacy in the two 
weeks before the new york primary 
and new york mayor ed koch joined in adding a racial and 
religious overtone to the debate that brought koch strong rebukes 
from some 
dukakis and jackson both refused to trade charges on that level 
tactics that they repeatedly praised each other for 
now the relationship will be truly tested as the two go 
headtohead for the rest of the primary season and perhaps into 
the convention 
dukakis is treading very very carefully in his theme of 
government experience as the reason to win voters support while 
at times his stance of im a doer not a talker seemed aimed 
directly at jackson he is careful now to praise jackson even as he 
draws the distinctions 
jesse has his own strengths and his own message and its an 
important one dukakis said what i offer is a record of 
helping to create jobs to save jobsof building housing and 
providing health care 
asked if that meant jackson doesnt have a record dukakis 
insisted he didnt mean that 
he doesnt have a record in government i do he has his other 
strengths i respect them and i admire them he said

proiranian extremists said sunday they 
will kill two american hostages and may attack inside the united 
states if us warships in the persian gulf launch new attacks on 
iran 
the statement came hours after an iranian gunboat attacked a 
saudi arabian tanker in the gulf despite a warning by president 
reagan that iran faced very costly consequences if it continued 
hitting neutral ships and other targets 
the extremists made their latest threat in a handwritten 
statement signed by the revolutionary justice organization a 
shiite moslem group and delivered to the associated press and the 
french news agency agence francepresse 
the group holds joseph cicippio 57 of valley forge pa and 
edward tracy 57 of burlington vt 
any new us aggression under any pretext or excuse will 
lead to the execution of spy edward tracy first and cicippio 
secondly the statement announced 
tracy a writer of childrens books was kidnapped oct 21 
1986 cicippio acting comptroller at the american university of 
beirut was kidnapped from campus earlier that year on sept 12 
cicippio and tracy are among nine americans and 13 other 
foreigners held hostage by various groups in lebanon the longest 
held is 40yearold terry a anderson of lorain ohio the chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
both copies of sundays statement were accompanied by 
photocopies of a lebanese groups membership card bearing tracys 
photograph however the organization is not named on the card and 
it was not clear if it was authentic 
last monday us warships disabled two iranian frigates and 
sank or disabled four other armed iranian vessels in the gulf 
tehran said 44 iranians were killed 
the attacks occurring in the gulf will not go unpunished and 
will not be as easy as america assumes the statement said our 
logical answer to the invasion of the region brings us to the 
option of moving the battle arena to inside america after which 
things will get out of control 
in another development beiruts conservative addiyar daily 
newspaper reported sunday that a deal to free three french hostages 
held by another shiite faction fell apart because of developments 
in the hijacking of a kuwaiti airliner the report said the captors 
reneged on pledges to release the french hostages because the 
hijackers were still in algiers algeria 
arab officials said that when the algerians negotiated an end to 
the 16day hijacking wednesday the shiite sky pirates abandoned 
the plane for guaranteed safe conduct to another country but 
addiyar without citing sources challenged earlier reports that 
the hijackers had left algiers and gone to either iran or lebanon 
sundays threat was the second issued by revolutionary justice 
in less than a week the group said in a similar handwritten 
arabiclanguage statement tuesday that there would be 
retaliations and retaliations for us military action in the 
gulf 
the earlier statement was accompanied by a polaroid photograph 
of cicippio 
in sundays statement the extremists described us naval 
presence in the gulf as a mean challenge to the free nations of 
the world 
the fighting in the gulf last monday flared after us warships 
blasted two offshore iranian oil platforms in what washington 
termed a measured response to the mining of a us frigate

as pennsylvania voters prepare to cast 
ballots in tuesdays primary there is growing criticism of the 
states unusual delegateselection system 
voters must choose from 300 largely obscure delegate candidates 
without knowing the contenders presidential preferences 
sen arlen specter rpa has called for changing the system 
and elsie hillman who heads george bushs pennsylvania operation 
said not listing prospective delegates loyalties is absolutely 
silly ridiculous 
with so many unknown delegate contenders running for a spot at 
the national convention the republican system places a premium on 
ballot position so much so that at least one congressman running 
for delegate believes he may lose because voters wont see his name 
im running for delegate but im like 17th out of 18 people 
on the ballot said rep don ritter of lehigh county i 
suspect that most people wont get to my name so it would not be 
at all surprising to finish very poorly 
another delegate candidate leonard falcone of wyoming pa 
called the list of names a spaghetti pile and said there are so 
many names in his 11th congressional district that voters 
actually have to get down on their knees in the balloting box to 
get to where the delegates are and im last 
said hillman its going to be a screwy ballot 
pennsylvania will send 96 delegates to the gop convention in 
august eighteen of those including specter have already been 
picked by the republican state committee 
the rest will be elected tuesday the ballot includes a handful 
of congressmen a former congressman and dozens of local elected 
officials it also includes many candidates making their first run 
at any office above the city level 
i just wanted to get more involved in the political process 
said contender frank romeo jr vice president of a familyowned 
food distribution firm in uniontown im a committeemen but ive 
never tried to run for anything else 
romeo drew poor ballot position seventh among seven candidates 
vying for three spots in the 22nd congressional district each of 
the states 23 districts automatically get three delegates and 
some get more based on a complicated formula that considers their 
support for ronald reagan in 1984 among other factors 
republican state committee chairman earl baker said 
pennsylvanias system evolved out of a desire to give the state 
more clout at the convention by holding back committing delegates 
to particular candidates 
baker said in an interview that the method encourages grassroots 
involvement if delegates preferences appeared on the ballot then 
you would take out the local aspect and have a fight between 
tickets he said 
pennsylvanias gop delegate rules are set by the republican 
state committee and baker said he saw no reason to change 
but specter said voters are entitled to have commitments 
otherwise you dont have the will of the people expressed 
its antidemocratic with a small d and a big d said 
jon delano press secretary to rep doug walgren dpa he said he 
preferred the pennsylvania democrats system of listing delegates 
on the ballot according to presidential preference or as 
uncommitted 
bush is expected to win the lions share of gop delegates 
mostly because his workers aggressively recruited wellknown local 
figures to run also the bush camp recently mailed 300000 slate 
cards to republican voters listing which delegates back the vice 
president 
but supporters of pat robertson drew the top ballot position in 
12 districts 
of course pennsylvania republicans will also cast their ballots 
for bush or robertson but that beauty contest portion of the 
election has no bearing on delegates

bishop cyril m wismar had prayed much of 
his life for a united lutheran church and when his prayers were 
answered he was left unemployed 
wismar 69 is one of several hundred bishops clergy members 
and lay church employees who lost their jobs when three lutheran 
branches merged jan 1 into the 53 millionmember evangelical 
lutheran church in america 
wismar had served for nearly 12 years as the new england bishop 
of the association of evangelical lutheran churches the smallest 
of the denominations 
his main goal now is to develop a ministry for other members of 
the clergy who are retired or alone 
i dont feel sorry for myself i feel sorry for many many 
people you have to realize that out there there are i guess 
literally thousands of people who are no longer serving in the 
roles in which they served in their former church affiliation 
wismar said in a recent interview at his home here 
for a while your telephone rings a lot and people call you a 
lot and youre running around a lot to parishes and assisting 
pastors and people and then suddenly youre not wismar said 
for almost 12 years ive been doing that and so very suddenly 
you come to a screeching halt and you want to do something he 
said 
its hard to think of the retired bishop doing nothing besides 
helping out at a local church he regularly visits patients in 
hospitals and convalescent homes administers communion to 
shutins hosts a halfhour local radio program every sunday and 
does a daily religious news update he also serves on the falls 
village board of education the housatonic valley regional high 
school board and the town and regional housing commissions 
but for those with less to do wismar is petitioning the new 
church to endorse his visitation program for retired clergy 
members he is asking parishes and private foundations to donate 
the 12000 to 13000 a year to pay him a stipend transportation 
and communication costs 
the new denomination was created by the merger of the lutheran 
church in america the american lutheran church and the 
association of evangelical lutheran churches 
bishop herbert chilstrom head of the new church said church 
planners decided all applicants for positions in the new church 
would be treated equally regardless of whether they held offices 
in the past 
in the lutheran church people are chosen for posts by secret 
ballots of congregations 
everyone lost their position because in the lutheran church 
you are not a bishop for life chilstrom said in a telephone 
interview from the churchs chicago headquarters no one who was 
a bishop had any guarantee he would continue in the church 
of those like wismar chilstrom said its a very tricky thing 
to say that these people in all cases were simply turned out what 
i can say in general is because of the merger on a churchwide 
level we were reduced by several hundred people 
wismar is pushing his plan because as bishop i noted that 
the people who are the most forgotten and neglected people in the 
church are the retired clergy and widows of retired clergy so i 
have devised a scheme for visitation of these people to find out 
what their needs are

john demjanjuks defense team has mounted a 
desperate effort to block a death sentence for the retired ohio 
autoworker convicted of being a brutal nazi death camp guard 
but the death penalty is expected monday from the three israeli 
judges who pronounced demjanjuk guilty last week in a sweeping 
verdict that rejected all defense arguments 
only one man has ever been executed in israels 40year history 
adolf eichmann the architect of the nazi leader adolf hitlers 
final solution against jews was convicted and hanged in 1962 
demjanjuks attorneys say their only goal at mondays hearing 
will be to save their clients life attorney john gill of 
cleveland said the defense and demjanjuks family are convinced 
evidence will eventually emerge clearing his client 
but if the judges impose the final solution on john they 
wont be able to bring him back when it becomes clear it was all a 
mistake the defense attorney said 
in their 450page judgment the tribunal convicted demjanjuk 
without hesitation or doubt of being the guard ivan the 
terrible and said he killed masses of human beings with his own 
hands at the treblinka death camp in nazioccupied poland 
yossi hassin a governmentappointed trial spokesman said 
demjanjuk most likely will face execution 
this verdict paved the way for a death sentence i would be 
very surprised if the judges gave demjanjuk anything less than 
death he told the associated press 
demjanjuks son said no matter what the defense argues he and 
other family members know what the sentence will be 
after the ludicrously sweeping judgment we dont expect 
anything less than a death penalty john jr said in an 
interview these are oldfashioned hanging judges 
nazi war crimes and terrorism are the only offenses punishable 
by death in the jewish state and israel has never executed a 
convicted terrorist 
justice minister avraham sharir urged the death penalty for 
demjanjuk a man convicted of such terrible crimes deserves no 
other sentence he said 
sharir has no authority over the state prosecutor who argues the 
sentence monday but his statement reflects the sentiments of many 
israelis including the nations 80000 holocaust survivors 
the death penalty is what this man deserves said 
frenchborn dina rosenbaum 58 who lost most of her family in nazi 
death camps im only sorry he lived so many years before being 
brought to justice 
throughout the 14month trial demjanjuk maintained his 
innocence and insisted he was a victim of mistaken identity 
after the verdict a somberlooking demjanjuk shouted to 
reporters as he was led away i am an innocent man this is 
ridiculous what happened today 
emerging from a visit with his father in prison demjanjuks son 
john jr said my father says the only judge that counts is god 
god knows hes innocent 
five death camp survivors identified demjanjuk as ivan 
including one who said he recognized the defendants walk and 
another who said he remembered demjanjuks murderous eyes 
at mondays hearing gill said he would emphasize the 
fallability of human memory and introduce 350 cases from as early 
as 1963 in which people later found to be innocent were convicted 
and sentenced to death 
in 62 percent of the cases the wrongful conviction was due to 
mistaken identity gill said 
but that argument has already been rejected by the judges who 
in their verdict gave great weight to the survivors testimony and 
praised their reliability and excellent memories 
although a guilty verdict was expected most longtime observers 
were surprised by the judges systematic rejection of all defense 
evidence including documents that contradicted the survivors 
testimony 
the judges dismissed discrepancies between survivors who 
contended demjanjuk was at treblinka in 1942 and 1943 and a former 
nazi guard who said demjanjuk was at the nearby sobibor death camp 
at the same time 
some israelis believe the death penalty will be imposed but not 
executed 
people expect this court to hand down the death penalty and 
the supreme court to reduce it to life imprisonment said gabriel 
bron of the israeli daily yediot ahronot the feeling is the 
supreme court will give greater weight to the doubts 
trial spokesman hassin agreed saying the supreme court could 
make a political decision to spare demjanjuk here in israel we 
dont like to impose death not even for terrorists 
but demjanjuks soninlaw ed nishnic who raised 650000 for 
demjanjuks defense said he doesnt expect clemency 
the israelis are killing palestinians like they were open 
game nishnic said referring to arabs killed during a fivemonth 
uprising in the israelioccupied territories 
israel is going to do with john whatever suits its purpose 
he said it doesnt care what the rest of the world thinks of its 
judicial system

a laboratory spill that led investigators 
on a trail of radioactive trash and contaminated several workers 
before the danger was apparent is under investigation for possible 
charges against the labs owner it was reported sunday 
the marshall diagnostics lab where the chemical spill occurred 
has been closed since shortly after the february accident and 
state officials said they will seal the lab until september when 
the radioactive residues will be harmless 
state health officials have tested the homes of lab workers and 
found low levels of radioactivity on pant legs shoes and other 
clothing of six workers 
the boston sunday globe reported that the spill happened feb 4 
when louis w mead a coowner of the lab and a chemical engineer 
for 42 years was working with tungsten 178 a radioactive 
material that could help detect heart and other medical problems 
when he realized the following day that about two ounces of the 
solution had spilled he tried to scrub it clean with bleach and 
water then tossed the wet towels into the trash a janitor not 
realizing the spill was radioactive volunteered to finish cleaning 
the lab over the weekend 
the following monday meads son did some carpentry work at the 
lab he threw his trash and the contaminated rags into his 
truck and took it to his parents home in lexington where the 
debris was put out the next wednesday with the familys garbage 
garbagemen took the two contaminated bags along with the rest 
of their load to the resco incinerator in north andover when they 
tried to unload an alarm went off and caused resco to refuse the 
garbage 
the radioactive wastes were taken to an old sanitary landfill in 
lexington the next day lexington police who had found an old 
bill linking the trash to mead visited him at the lab and he 
accompanied them to the landfill 
mead collected the contaminated materials which had leaked from 
his garbage bags and now filled 10 plastic bags and took them to 
his lab two wheelbarrows of contaminated material were removed 
five days later from the landfill after a snowstorm 
mead has given a detailed chronology of the spill and its spread 
to state officials who have supplemented the report with their own 
investigation the globe said 
we are going out of business mead told the newspaper my 
partner and i are going into retirement 
while officials expect any radioactive material in the lab to 
decay the remaining wastes have been shipped to a licensed storage 
facility in tinley park ill 
robert hallisey chief of radiation safety at the state 
department of public health said he is considering whether to 
impose penalties or recommend prosecution against mead and his 
partner marshall deutsch 
hallisey said he was pleased by meads cooperation but still 
could recommend penalties of up to 6000 
we need a strong state posture on handling radioactive 
materials hallisey said we intend to do that

a cadre of officers has kept the peace 
during this years chippewa indian spearfishing season the fourth 
since federal courts upheld the indians right to harvest resources 
on lands the tribes ceded to the government 
protests against the indian fishing rights and their method of 
taking large numbers of sport fish have been noisy and violent in 
previous years including shots fired at some lakes in 1986 no 
serious injuries have been reported 
an argument between an indian and an nonindian over a traffic 
incident last week looked like it might turn into a scuffle but 
iron county sheriff don bungi quickly separated the two when more 
spectators arrived he called for backup officers bringing in more 
than a dozen squad cars 
the sixyear veteran who oversees a fourman department has 
become experienced in handling crowds during the controversial 
offreservation spearfishing season on lakes in northern wisconsin 
protesters consider spearing an unfair way of bagging the 
walleyed pike and muskies that are a prime tourism attraction for 
sportsfishers 
an early show of force by police marked this spearfishing 
season and protests seem to have moved off the boat landings and 
onto the lakes 
each night before sunset a national guard helicopter passes 
over the lakes police sometimes outnumber spectators and new 
signs announce that alcoholic beverages are prohibited on the 
landings at night 
federal court rulings have upheld chippewa rights retained in 
19th century treaties to harvest resources including fishing 
hunting trapping and harvesting wild rice off the reservations 
on land the tribes ceded to the federal government 
each band is allowed 15 days of spearing spearers may take no 
more than 20 percent of what biologists figure a lakes fish 
population can tolerate the season ends by may 6 
the indians fish at night using lanterns to help them find the 
fish which they catch with spears up to eight feet in length 
on saturday night 11th night of the season 123 chippewa 
spearers took 3088 fish despite cold weather and snow in some 
places 
dave daniel a state department of natural resources spokesman 
at woodruff said there was no trouble at any site although a 
group of protesters did watch the lac du flambeau tribe spear at 
squirrel lake in vilas county 
it was a very quiet last night daniels said there were 
probably 40 or 45 protesters that showed up on squirrel lake but 
they were peaceful and quiet and there to observe and that was it 
some critics have said the police presence is too costly and 
possibly unwarranted 
the taxpayers have to pay for this said bill schnautc of 
butternut a spearfishing opponent 
the state division of emergency government estimated costs for 
the first five days of the season at about 50000 said dave 
kunelius a natural resources spokesman 
local police who began planning security in december organized 
two backup units of 30 officers each from other areas in the state 
the backup units are stationed in northern wisconsin during the 
spearfishing season 
at butternut lake the site last year of a protest that 
required more than 150 officers to keep peace about 75 officers 
were stationed on the boat landing before indians or protesters 
arrived this year 
theres obviously some areas where we anticipated trouble 
said george meyer chief administrator of law enforcement for the 
department of natural resources 
this years problems have been mainly complaints that 
spearfishermen have been harassed by nonindian boats creating 
waves shining lights and splashing water near them 
gatherings at boat landings have been smaller this year than 
last which authorities attribute partly to colder weather and 
partly to more visible security 
i think its great were getting cooperation from both 
sides bungi said friday i think everythings going smoothly 
tom maulson a lac du flambeau tribal judge and spearfishing 
organizer applauded the police effort but said he wished it was 
not needed 
its just unfortunate that we have a lot of people watching us 
fish he said its a shame that a few protesters have to cost 
the state of wisconsin so much money

palestine liberation organization chief 
yasser arafat came to damascus sunday for the first time since he 
was expelled five years ago plo officials said arafat and syria 
would end their split 
arafat his leadership beset by the april 16 assassination of 
his deputy khalil wazir flew in from libya and visited wazirs 
grave 
arafats arrival in the syrian capital capped a weeklong 
mediation effort by libyan leader col moammar gadhafi and algerian 
president chadli benjedid to heal the rift between the onetime 
allies plo sources said on condition of anonymity 
arafats key political aide farouk kaddoumi also been working 
on the reconciliation conducting negotiations in damascus since 
tuesday 
arafat was accompanied by salah khalaf who with arafat and 
wazir founded the guerrillas mainstream faction fatah lt col 
mustafa kharroubi a chief aide to libyan leader col moammar 
gadhafi also was on the plane 
asked if he would meet with president hafez assad arafat said 
god willing 
arafat and khalaf drove to the martyrs cemetry in damascus 
yarmouk palestinian refugee camp to pay tribute to wazir 
thousands of the camps 220000 refugees took to the streets to 
welcome the palestinian leader blood and souls we sacrifice for 
you abu ammar they chanted invoking arafats nom de guerre 
the refugees surrounded arafats car and then lifted it off the 
ground in an emotional demonstration of support 
arafat was expelled from syria five years ago during a bloody 
feud with assad he had been expected to surmount his disagreements 
with assad last week so he could fly to damascus for wazirs burial 
last wednesday but that plan failed 
at least one plo official said the imminent reconciliation was 
due to the death of wazir also known as abu jihad 
the martyrdom of abu jihad certainly pushed the reconciliation 
forward bassam abu sharif arafats adviser said in a telephone 
interview from tunis 
joining hands with our syrian brothers is the response for 
israels crime abu jihads blood is the bridge of unity for the 
forces fighting the zionist occupation of arab land he said 
indeed palestinian factions divided since the plosyrian rift 
all denounced wazirs killing and vowed revenge they called for 
the reunification within the plo and a reconciliation with syria as 
a response to israels apparent effort to weaken the movement 
israeli military sources have said wazir 52 was gunned down in 
tunisia by a commando unit in a raid planned by israels mossad 
intelligence agency the israeli government has not confirmed it 
arafat flew into damascus airport amid tight security he was 
met at the plane by interior minister mohammed harba and saeed 
hamadi a member of the ruling baath partys regional command 
there was little ceremony at the airport 
arafat is generally accorded a headofstate welcome in arab 
countries which regard the plo as the sole representative of the 
worlds 5 million palestinians but the syrian government reacted 
cautiously to arafats first visit to damascus since he was kicked 
out june 24 1983 
the plo and syria have been inching toward a rapprochement since 
arafat cut off relations with egypt in april 1987 and prosyrian 
plo factions made peace with arafats mainstream fatah faction of 
the plo 
syria spearhead of arab radicalism has refused to make up with 
egypt until president hosni mubarak cancels the march 1979 peace 
treaty that his predecessor the late anwar sadat signed with 
israel 
syria and arafat are adamantly opposed to separate peace deals 
with israel 
the assadarafat feud erupted after israels invasion of lebanon 
in 1982 and the consequent evacuation of the plo from its power 
base in beirut and south lebanon 
arafat at that time began looking into the prospects of 
negotiating peace with israel 
that angered assad and plo radicals who advocate armed struggle 
against israel 
in may 1983 the friction exploded into an allout battle 
between arafats supporters and syrianbacked hardliners seeking to 
oust the guerrilla chief from the plo leadership 
by december that year the dissidents had overrun arafats bases 
in east and north lebanon forcing him to abandon his last lebanese 
strongholds 
by 1985 the plo had slowly infiltrated back into beirut and 
south lebanon 
that prompted the syrianbacked shiite moslem amal movement in 
lebanon to attack palestinian refugee camps 
the socalled war of the camps ended only three months ago 
as the plo and syria inched toward a settlement

states should be required to provide health 
care for all pregnant women with incomes below the federal poverty 
standard a house committee recommended sunday in a bipartisan 
report 
the house government operations committee said neonatal 
intensive care and other health and education expenses resulting 
from babies born prematurely cost three to 10 times as much as the 
prenatal care that often prevents premature births 
the panel said that as of january only 26 states were taking 
advantage of a twoyearold option to extend medicaid to all 
pregnant women with incomes below the federal poverty level 
9690 for example for a family of three 
three other states were planning to take up a 1987 option 
permitting expansion of the program to pregnant women with incomes 
up to 185 percent of the federal poverty level 
since the majority of women below the poverty line cannot 
possibly afford health insurance it is necessary to require 
medicaid coverage for pregnant women below the federal poverty 
line the report said 
had all states covered prenatal care labor and delivery costs 
last year for such women the report said it would have cost the 
medicaid program 190 million 
the unanimously approved committee report was based on an 
investigation by the human resources subcommittee chaired by rep 
ted weiss dny 
among other things it recommended that the department of health 
and human services ensure that medicaid reimbursement rates are 
fair in order to ease serious spot shortages of doctors willing to 
serve lowincome women 
the report said there are 15 california counties with no doctors 
that accept medicaid maternity patients and similar problems have 
been reported in the northeast and midwest 
citing various studies the report said professional prenatal 
care not including labor and delivery fees costs about 400 
while the lifetime cost of health and custodial care for a 
lowbirthweight handicapped infant can amount to 100 times that 
much 
about 40000 us infants born each year die before their first 
birthday a rate higher than many other industrialized nations a 
major cause of infant mortality is birthweight of less than 55 
pounds research has repeatedly shown that the birth of such 
babies also at high risk for having permanent handicaps of all 
kinds can often be prevented with simple prenatal care 
congress has been allowing states to expand medicaid to more 
lowincome pregnant women and children each year but has not 
required such coverage states pay 50 to 80 percent of medicaid 
costs 
if we are serious about saving lives and cutting the federal 
deficit we will immediately provide free prenatal care on the 
women who need it weiss said in a statement spending more 
money on prenatal care will save millions more in health care and 
special education and other services this year and in years to 
come

democratic presidential contender michael 
dukakis whistlestopped across pennsylvania on sunday promising 
help to economically strapped communities and suggesting republican 
rival george bush would rather build aircraft carriers than 
rebuilding roads and trains 
i think i know where the american people are they are tired 
of crumbling bridges congested airports jammed highways homeless 
people on streets and in doorwaysand they want a change the 
democratic frontrunner said 
dukakis riding on his pennsylvania presidential unlimited 
also rejected as absurd suggestions from his remaining rival jesse 
jackson that he should put forward a federal budget for a year 
hence 
in pittsburgh greensburg johnstown and altoona the 
massachusetts governor concentrated on economic development and 
jobs as he toured on the chartered amtrak train two days before the 
pennsylvania primary 
if we cant bring good jobs and economic opportunity back to 
the johnstowns of this country then there is something the matter 
with us he told a crowd outside the train station in johnstown 
i believe we can i believe were going to 
dukakis leads jackson in the polls here but he campaigned hard 
looking for a fourth straight bigstate victory to cement his claim 
on the 1988 democratic presidential nomination 
standing in a cold rain at the train station in greensburg 
dukakis related the economic problems of the steel and coal towns 
to the problems in massachusetts in the 1960s and 1970s 
as a new englander we went through the same kind of pain and 
economic distress as you have he said our communities have 
come back and these communities are going to come back 
dukakis rejected recent criticism from bush the republican 
nomineetobe for his opposition to building two new super carrier 
task forces that he said would cost 36 billion 
if he thinks thats where we ought to put our scarce 
resources then so be it but its going to be a fundamental issue 
in this campaign he said adding his litany of bridges airports 
and highways that need rebuilding 
in an interview on the train dukakis hit bush on amtrak the 
reagan adminstration has proposed cutting off its government 
subsidies a move some say would kill the system 
whats he for is he for destroying amtrak dukakis said 
if he is he cant conceiveably understand what it takes to build 
a strong economic future not only in the northeast corridor but 
all over this country 
then adding a charge he has made sometimes against fellow 
democrats dukakis said of bush hes never balanced a budget 
ive had to make these tough choices 
the massachusetts governor rejected jacksons suggestion that he 
put forward a proposed federal budget now 
you cant prepare a budget now for next year thats 
absurd he told reporters on the train 
ive been very specific he added you cant build a strong 
ecnomic future in the country unless its based on on a very solid 
fiscal foundation and what the next president is going to have to 
do is a combination of deficit reduction and targeted investments 
and economic growth at the same time 
asked what he thought jackson was doing with his pressure to put 
budget specifics out on the table dukakis answered i dont know 
what hes trying to do 
on education dukakis said were not going to run the 
nations school system from washington the thing a president has 
to do is to set some priorities and got after them 
and at a news conference in johnstowndukakis added 
any candidate who proposes a budget now for next year doesnt 
know what budgeting is all about couldnt possibly imagine or 
understand what it is to put a budget together 
ill lay out where im going to make the cuts ive done that 
in great detail ill lay out where i think we ought to do some 
investing ive done that in great detail 
he referred to experience in 1975 when he had to go back on a 
no tax pledge because of budget deficits 
i had to eat an awful lot of crow and im never going to make 
that mistake againif it is one thing i have learned very 
painfully is that you cant be drawing up budgets today for next 
year no candidate knows exactly what youre going to confront 
at the train station in johnstown dukakis faced several dozen 
antiabortion demonstrators who chanted slogans

an iranian speedboat shot up a saudi 
arabianowned tanker in the strait of hormuz on sunday after 
president reagan said the us navy will no longer ignore attacks 
on noncombatants in the persian gulf region 
the speedboat fired rocketpropelled grenades and machine guns 
at the 37011ton sea trader in the strait the southern entrance 
to the gulf 
an unexploded rocket dangled from the sea traders hull after 
the attack but fell into the sea before the tanker reached the port 
of dubai in the united arab emirates 
the indian master capt br pagarkar reported his vessel 
sustained slight damage and no casualties among the indian crew 
it was not known whether any us warships were near the sea 
trader during the attack navy officials do not disclose warships 
movements but several us frigates and destroyers have been in 
the southern gulf since last week when us and iranian ships 
skirmished in the area 
reagan warned iran in his weekly radio broadcast saturday that 
continued attacks on neutral parties including gulf shipping 
will be very costly to iran and its people 
on friday us officials disclosed in washington that the 
reagan administration was planning to expand the us naval role in 
the gulf by giving american commanders the right to intervene in 
iranian attacks on nonus flag vessels 
previously us warships have only been permitted to provide 
humanitaran aid to nonamerican ships in distress and 
requesting aid but not to intercede in armed conflict involving 
those ships 
gulfbased shipping executives speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the sea trader encountered a flotilla of six armed 
speedboats as it sailed into the gulf through the strait about 730 
am 1130 pm edt saturday 
the tanker owned by a saudi firm but flying the liberian flag 
was bound for the saudi oil port of ras tanura 
pagarkar said five of the speedboats went in one direction 
while one appeared to be heading for another tanker and i thought 
wed escaped an attack but suddenly it veered toward my ship 
asking for the master 
the executives quoted him as saying the speedboat opened fire 
after the iranians demanded the ships destination and indicated 
they intended to board it 
there was nothing to directly link the raid on the sea trader to 
reagans comments or to an earlier report that the united states 
was preparing to adopt a new gettough policy following last weeks 
skirmishes between iran and the us navy 
but the attack the first since two ships were hit tuesday in 
the aftermath of a major usiranian clash the day before 
suggested iran was determined to show its ability to carry out 
shipping raids despite its losses 
in the skirmishes april 18 us navy forces sank or damaged a 
halfdozen of irans armed craft including two frigates that have 
regularly operated in the strait and nearby waters 
there have been no reports since april 8 of iraqi air strikes on 
iranian oil tankers the type of attacks for which iran customarily 
retaliates by striking at neutral vessels 
iraqs last reported action in the gulf was friday when the 
official iraqi news agency said baghdads forces sunk a small 
iranian naval craft that claim was not confirmed by ndependent 
sources or iran which is fighting a 7yearold war with iraq 
us military sources speaking anonymously said iran 
apparently fired its only remaining harpoon antiship missile 
during the skirmishes april 18 
the weapon was one of nine given to the iranian navy by the 
united states during the rule of shah mohammed reza pahlavi 
us intelligence sources told the associated press in september 
that evidence indicated iran had one operational harpoon and made a 
practice of mounting it on a kamanclass boat just for show 
it was fired by a kamanclass patrol boat in an encounter with 
the us guided missile frigate wainwright and the guided missile 
frigate simpson during the april 18 skirmishes 
the iranian patrol boat fired at the 8200ton wainwright from a 
distance of about 12 miles the sources said the wainwright fired 
defensive chaff rockets filled with shards of aluminum and 
other materials to confuse the missiles radar guidance system 
the missile sailed over the cruiser and fell into the water 
almost simultaneously the simpson fired a harpoon that destroyed 
the iranian boat

the us economy would lose 480 for every 
gallon of gas saved in steering car buyers away from the 
convenience and pleasure of bigger cars according to a 
government economist 
the economist andrew n kleit a member of the federal trade 
commission staff argues that car buyers should not be induced to 
give up big cars and says just as much fuel would be saved by an 
additional tax on gasoline of 2 or 3 cents a gallon 
people clearly get pleasure from buying large cars and i dont 
see anything illicit in that at all kleit said in an interview 
about his report the impact of automobile fuel economy 
standards he said the report represents his own views and not 
those of the ftc bureau of economics which published it as working 
paper no 160 
at the urging of general motors corp and ford motor co the 
transportation department lowered the standard manufactures must 
meet from an average of 275 miles per gallon for all their cars to 
26 mpg for 1986 and 1987 cars it was kept at 26 mpg for 1988 but 
will revert to 275 mpg for the 1989 model year unless the 
department acts again 
kleits study of 1986 and 1987 models which he says represents 
his own views and not those of the commission is being used by 
people who are trying to abolish these corporate average fuel 
economy or cafe standards 
congress imposed the standards in 1975 because it was spooked by 
the 1973 arab oil embargo and long gasoline lines the standards 
were meant as a fuelsaving alternative to higher taxes on fuel or 
imported crude oil 
higher standards are supported by environmentalists who want to 
see less fossil fuel burned 
opponents of the higher standards include auto safety proponents 
who estimate that a 1 mpg increase in the standard for 1989 cars 
could mean an extra 220 to 390 deaths a year for a decade large 
cars are generally considered safer than small ones 
to have met the higher standard in 1986 and 1987 kleit said in 
an interview about a million buyers would have had to switch from 
large to small cars the only way to do this he said would have 
been to raise the price of the average domestic large car by about 
1200 and lower the price of the average domestic small car by 
about 800 
he said buyers would not have spent the 33 billion they were 
willing to put up for the satisfaction of owning and driving larger 
cars that many dollars worth of convenience and pleasure as 
shown by the difference in the prices of large cars people bought 
and small ones they would have bought 
profits to us manufacturers would have been 111 million less 
declines at gm and ford partially offset by increases at chrysler 
so the loss to the economy would have been the sum of the two 
numbers more than 34 billion kleit said 
about 712 million gallons of gasoline would be saved over the 
lives of the cars kleit calculated so the cost per gallon saved 
would have been simply 34 billion divided by this number of 
gallons 480 in round figures different assumptions could make 
it anywhere from 371 to 621 he said 
while cafe policy can save gasoline it does so at a 
prohibitive cost to the economy kleit wrote 
one of his critics tina hobson head of the renew america 
project a group advocating conservation and use of renewable 
energy sources said kleits work ignored the need to disconnect 
macho from cars we need to unlink car ownership from personal 
satisfaction 
alan durning of the worldwatch institute coauthor of a recent 
paper urging more conservation said of kleits proposition its 
a bit of fancy footwork about a fine point

he plagiarized his 1985 hit just another night 
excited fans autographseeking court employees rumors of free 
concerts and milling reporters have turned the rock stars court 
battle into a circus 
the unimposing cramped court a former office building 
converted in 1983 is 25 miles north and light years away from the 
majestic beaux arts federal courthouse in manhattans foley square 
where the suit was first filed the building has a single elevator 
and only four telephones a frustration for the horde of reporters 
whove come from as far away as australia 
the building hosted the yearlong chapter 11 bankruptcy case of 
texaco but even that highprofile event didnt prepare the 
courthouse for what would happen when a rock legend came to town 
it began when patrick alley a 36yearold reggae musician from 
the bronx filed a lawsuit jan 2 1986 charging jagger with 
copyright infringement over the songs chorus the suit was filed 
in foley square and was assigned to us district judge gerard 
goettel 
goettel was later transferred to white plains and the case moved 
north 
jagger managed one day of obscurity when the trial opened april 
18 but the media was alerted tuesday and by wednesday goettels 
fourthfloor courtroom was beginning to fill with reporters and 
excited fans 
it was on wednesday that jagger greeted a handful of journalists 
at the start of the day with a how are we all today he said he 
was battling the case because his credibility was on the line 
it was also wednesday that one of jaggers lawyers helene 
freeman was stopped by federal marshals as she entered the 
building and brought before us magistrate joel tyler tyler 
ordered the lawyer to get autographs for his two daughters his law 
clerk and secretary 
later that day drummer lowell sly dunbar took the stand and 
played his testimony prompting a recess in a fraud case on the 
third floor 
dunbar is alleged to have performed on both recordings but 
testified he could not remember drumming for alleys recording made 
in 1979 
jagger gave out autographs to the growing mob of fans 
thursday word got out that jagger was going to testify and maybe 
even play because his guitar and equipment were set up in the 
courtroom 
rumors of a free concert spread and by friday the crowds were 
tremendous causing the building security force to limit entry if 
a spectator left the courtroom which seats about 50 uncomfortably 
for any reason that was it he was replaced 
throughout the three hours of jaggers afternoon testimony all 
seats were filled 
jagger never did sing but tapes of the song were played over 
and over with even the jury swaying to the beat and the judge 
who said he doesnt like rock music occasionally looking pained 
a spirited recitation of jumpin jack flash to demonstrate 
how repetition was used in his music was as close as jagger came 
to a concert

when michael r milken the king of junk bond 
financing appears before a congressional committee this week more 
will be on members minds than the role of highrisk highyield 
bonds in the nations economy 
milken of drexel burnham lambert inc is a pioneer in the use of 
socalled junk bonds in corporate takeovers and also a key figure 
in the governments investigation into wall streets insider 
trading scandal he would be the first central player in the 
insider trading scandal to testify in public 
a staff member for the house energy and commerce subcommittee 
said the panel has steered clear of attempting to learn the 
direction of insider trading probes by the securities and exchange 
commission and the us attorneys office in manhattan 
weve done that deliberately so drexel could not say at a 
later date that we were using the congressional process to squeeze 
them the aide said speaking on condition of anonymity 
because of that the aide said problems associated with junk 
bond financing not insider trading will be the focus of this 
weeks hearings 
even so milkens attorneys have indicated to the subcommittee 
there is a good chance he will claim the fifth amendment the 
staffer said 
drexel disclosed in february that the sec had notified the firm 
that its staff planned to recommend civil charges against the firm 
and some of its employees for securities law violations the firm 
has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing 
since the indictment nearly a year and a half ago of speculator 
ivan boesky members of congress have been hungry for news about 
the progress or lack of progress in the sec probe 
theyve gotten little to allay their curiosity last may john 
shad then sec chairman told senators they could expect to see 
succession of shoes dropping through the summer 
no shoes fell and in december sen donald w riegle jr 
dmich chairman of the senate banking subcommittee on securities 
pressed shads successor david s ruder for an explanation 
ruder said he expected additional major cases but said the 
cases were exceedingly complicated and their completion months 
away 
the house energy and commerce subcommittee on investigations 
which subpoenaed milken to appear wednesday has also been 
examining the insidertrading scandal drexel chief executive 
frederick joseph is scheduled to appear thursday 
the investigations subcommittee met behind closed doors last 
june to hear from dennis b levine a merger specialist at drexel 
who was convicted of securities fraud and is now serving a sentence 
at federal prison in lewisburg pa 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee and its investigations subcommittee has said he 
also would like to call boesky who is in federal prison at lompoc 
calif 
milken is the architect of drexels pioneering beverly hills 
califbased business in junk bonds which have been frequently 
used to help finance corporate takeovers like those in which boesky 
speculated 
critics of corporate takeovers maintain that the buildup of 
thinly secured debt is dangerous to the economy 
meanwhile concern in the senate about the sec investigation has 
not gone away 
riegle in december had asked for a letter from ruder on the 
status of the probe and received what a senate staff member who 
spoke on condition of anonymity described as a pro forma 
response 
the aide said senate banking committee chairman william 
proxmire dwis is also anxious to see results 
i think proxmire will probably wait until the end of the 
summer and then seek some satisfaction why this investigation 
is taking so long we wont drop the ball but at the same time we 
have a lot of confidence in the sec and the prosecutors office in 
new york the aide said

the daughter of a woman on trial in the 
drugtampering deaths of her husband and another person takes the 
stand this week and prosecutors say she will testify her mother 
repeatedly discussed ways to get rid of her stepfather 
authorities say stella nickell the first person in the united 
states to be tried on federal charges of causing death by tampering 
with overthecounter capsules plotted to kill bruce nickell to 
collect insurance 
the cyanide poisoning deaths contributed to a nationwide 
tampering scare and excedrin manufacturer bristolmyers recalled 
all its nonprescription medicine sold in capsule form 
cindy hamilton mrs nickells daughter was scheduled to 
testify monday the government alleges that over several years mrs 
nickell discussed drugs and overdoses and hit men with her 
daughter and eventually began interjecting her husbands name into 
the conversations 
the marriage was unhappy but mrs nickell was determined not to 
lose her trailer home in auburn a suburb between seattle and 
tacoma in a divorce prosecutors say witnesses have testified 
that the nickells were several thousand dollars in debt when 
nickell died in june 1986 and faced foreclosure on the home 
but thomas hillier the federal public defender representing 
mrs nickell said ms hamilton is not a credible witness had been 
a drug abuser and was probably thinking of the 300000 reward 
established by a pharmaceutical group when she contacted the fbi in 
january 1987 
mrs nickell is charged in the 1986 deaths of nickell 52 and 
of susan katherine snow 40 also of auburn and accused of putting 
cyanide in capsules of extrastrength excedrin 
the prosecution has suggested no links between the victims 
except the manner of their deaths and says that mrs nickell 
planted cyanidetainted capsules in local stores to divert 
suspicion after she poisoned her husband 
mrs nickell also faces three counts of tampering with a product 
involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in two 
extrastrength excedrin bottles and an anacin3 bottle that were 
recovered in stores in auburn and nearby kent 
in the first two days of testimony last week fbi agent ron 
nichols said mrs nickell told him she wasnt interested in 
benefiting financially from her husbands death but denied that 
there were three life insurance policies 
mrs nickell said in november 1986 that her husband had only a 
25000 state employees life insurance policy nichols testified 
but witnesses testified that policy was really worth 31000 if 
nickell had died of natural causes and 136000 if he died of 
accidental causes 
thats why mrs nickell pressed medical authorities for a more 
specific cause of death when they initially ruled he died of 
emphysema said assistant us attorney joanne maida 
it was only after ms snows death was confirmed as caused by 
acute cyanide poisoning that nickells cause of death was 
reexamined 
prosecutors say they will present two additional insurance 
policies worth 20000 each including at least one on which mrs 
nickell allegedly forged her husbands name the total benefits of 
the three policies could have reached 176000 
in his opening statement hillier told jurors there are 
reasonable explanations for many of the prosecutions points and 
that the governments case is largely circumstantial 
he said mrs nickell will take the stand and contradict her 
daughters testimony 
trial resumes monday with the continuation of testimony by 
bonnie anderson a former coworker of mrs nickells 
ms anderson testified last week that on the day after nickell 
died she was with mrs nickell when she told ms hamilton about 
her stepfathers death 
she looked cindy straight in the eye and said i know what 
youre thinking and the answer is no ms anderson testified 
ms anderson also said mrs nickell had discussed marital 
problems when the two worked as security officers at seattletacoma 
international airport 
she said she liked being on the late shift because she didnt 
have to see so much of bruce ms anderson said

investigators searching for the cause of two 
explosions that destroyed a grain elevator examined the rubble 
sunday after recovering the last body of five workers killed in the 
blasts 
theres a strong possibility that ignited grain dust sparked 
the explosions that flattened the adm growmark granary but it 
could be days before the exact cause and origin of the blasts are 
pinpointed joliet fire chief george plese said sunday airborne 
grain dust can be highly explosive 
after working nonstop for about 29 hours about 100 volunteers 
and professionals using cranes and bulldozers uncovered the bodies 
of three workers saturday who had been missing since fridays 
explosion plese said 
the last of the five victims were found in the basement of the 
granary crushed by the wave of corn and soybeans that had swept 
them there the chief said 
the bodies were discovered within half an hour of each other at 
the complex on the des plaines river about 40 miles southwest of 
chicago said police detective alan horvath 
as far as i can tell from the preliminary examinations at the 
scene there was no burning on these bodies will county deputy 
coroner william ferguson said saturday night indications are 
that they would have died instantly from the injuries 
officials finally ruled out a witness report that the blasts 
had blown a worker off a barge and into the river and a search of 
the river was called off plese said 
authorities believe that airborne grain dust was ignited in the 
first explosion which apparently ruptured a natural gas main and 
touched off a second blast moments later plese said 
the blasts turned the 100foot silos at the site into 
30foothigh mounds of twisted steel reinforced concrete and 
70000 bushels of corn and soybeans plese said 
we had to dig through all of that to get at these people who 
were buried he said by phone sunday from joliet 
by late saturday when the bodies of the missing men were found 
most of the debris had been hauled away to a nearby landfill he 
said 
investigators from the illinois office of the occupational 
safety and health administration impounded much of the structural 
steel plese said 
plese said he was moved by the help from local construction 
trade unions trucking and wrecking companies and fire departments 
in the area who volunteered in the rescue effort 
about 60 volunteers joined the estimated 40 workers at the scene 
who sifted through rubble nonstop from the time it blew up until 
we dug them out he said 
the victims found saturday were identified as donald e zack of 
joliet daniel mclaughlin 18 of manhattan and michael dupuis 
23 of bourbonnais said the deputy coroner 
the bodies of mark stewart 20 of princeton and dale brent 
slatton 28 of newark were found friday 
three people were injured in the blasts only one remained 
hospitalized sunday in fair condition

us sen david karnes faces a tough battle 
in the republican primary may 10 and even if he survives that he 
is not expected to fare well against popular exgov bob kerrey in 
november 
gop voters will have to look closely to find substantial 
differences between karnes and his primary challenger us rep 
hal daub both of whom espouse a conservative philosophy according 
to republican stalwarts 
the major difference i see in them is probably in style 
said state gop chairman norm riffel 
their similarity may be making the decision a hard one for 
voters in the primary 
a march poll taken for the omaha worldherald showed karnes 
favored 42 percent to 38 percent but thats with a margin of error 
of 51 percentage points a december poll showed daub with a 
5point lead 
while an incumbent doesnt usually face a tough primary fight 
karnes didnt take office by the usual route a political unknown 
he was appointed in march 1987 by republican gov kay orr to fill 
the unexpired term of the late sen edward zorinsky a democrat 
daub a fourterm congressman from the omahadominated 2nd 
district was one of the betterknown gop regulars who sought the 
appointment 
he has been appointed and not elected thats the main 
difference between us ive laid it on the line daub said 
karnes future may be linked to the political popularity of mrs 
orr a march poll taken for the worldherald found that her 
popularity rating was 48 percent the first time it was below 50 
percent in her 14 months in office 
daub has indirectly argued that karnes is the governors 
candidate and thus may be vulnerable if nebraskans are unhappy with 
her 
whatever happens in the primary the winner will have to face 
kerrey whose popularity has bedeviled the gop for years kerrey 
faces token opposition in the democratic primary from ken 
michaelis who was disbarred in 1982 for what the state supreme 
court called scurrilous attacks upon the bar and bench 
kerrey was virtually unknown when he stepped from private life 
into the governors race in 1982 and in his first political 
effort defeated incumbent republican charles thone 
his onetime romantic relationship with actress debra winger 
and her frequent and lengthy stays at the governors mansion 
appeared to only endear kerrey further to nebraskans 
the hallmark of kerreys style has been his willingness to 
adjust positions on important issues ranging from school district 
consolidation to pay raises for state employees whenever he 
thought necessary 
he has said he never hesitated to change his mind on the basis 
of new information or better analysis only dead men and fools 
dont change their minds he once said 
but the most frequent criticism of kerrey from political 
friends as well as foes has been that he is unpredictable on even 
the most major state issues 
at the outset of his senate campaign kerrey frequently said 
i dont have all the answers but emphasized his longexpressed 
concern for the educational system and the need to bring the 
federal deficit into line 
kerrey lost one leg below the knee during a navy seal team 
operation in the vietnam war he was awarded the congressional 
medal of honor

a judge said he does not agree with 
trying a 16yearold as a juvenile for the ax slayings of his 
parents and two siblings but insisted the law gives him no choice 
district judge gerard ring said friday he hopes the case will 
prompt the legislature to review the law on juvenile crime 
under the present law i can give the same disposition to a 
juvenile for stealing a baby ruth candy bar as for murdering baby 
ruth he said i have never agreed with that 
ring denied a motion to have david brom tried as an adult on 
charges of murdering his parents bernard and paulette brom his 
brother ricky 11 and sister diane 14 at the familys home feb 
18 
if brom is convicted as a juvenile he will be released at age 
19 or when he has been deemed rehabilitated whichever comes first 
if triedas an adult and convicted he would face a life sentence 
with parole eligibility after about 17 years 
to try a juvenile as an adult state law requires the prosecutor 
to show that the child is not suited to rehabilitative treatment 
and is a danger to the community 
ring wrote in a ruling released friday that neither standard 
applied to brom who was described by a courtappointed 
psychiatrist as deferential polite and compliant and had no 
prior record 
i dont agree at all with the outcome the judge said at 
the same time he said i know the decision was the correct one 
legally 
olmsted county attorney ray schmitz said he will appeal the 
ruling 
sheriff charles von wald and police chief pat farrell complained 
that the ruling focused too much on rehabilitation and not 
punishment 
but ring countered there is nothing in the statute about 
punishment and it does require consideration of treatment he 
said he disagrees with the juvenile court concept that looks only 
to the childs needs 
the psychiatrist dr carl malmquist testified earlier this 
month that brom described the killings to him and that depression 
made brom suicidal and eventually homicidal 
an older brother joseph 19 lived away from the brom home and 
is the only other survivor of the immediate family

education secretary william j bennett says 
the american education system has made little progress in the five 
years since a searing report called a nation at risk warned 
that the system was sinking below a rising tide of mediocrity 
the school system bennett says in a report to be formally 
delivered to president reagan on tuesday is still at risk 
bennett acknowledged that american education has made some 
undeniable progress in the last few years we are doing better 
than we were in 1983 
but he wrote we are certainly not doing well enough and 
we are not doing well enough fast enough we are still at risk the 
absolute level at which our improvements are taking place is 
unacceptably low 
bennett decried the dropout rate poor education of those who do 
graduate from high school the widely varying quality of school 
curricula the rarity of good schools for disadvantaged and 
minority children and the manner of promoting teachers and 
principals that make excellence a matter of chance not design 
he cited a recent gallup poll that found a wide majority of 
americans favoring school reforms but said future reforms face 
serious obstacles 
above all sound education reforms are threatened by the 
determined opposition they elicit bennett said pointing to 
what might be called opposition by extortion the false claim 
that to fix our schools will first require a fortune in new 
funding 
in addition bennett said more and more the opposition to 
school reform is now manifested in the narrow selfinterested 
exercise of political power in statehouse corridors and local 
school board meetings almost without fail wherever a worthwhile 
school proposal or legislative initiative is under consideration 
those with a vested interest in the educational status quo will use 
political muscle to block reform and too often the antireformers 
succeed if our schools are to improve that power must be 
overcome 
many experts agree that the us school system needs upgrading 
but some say the federal government is part of the problem 
national education association president mary hatwood futrell 
has charged that school reform is withering on the vine due to 
lack of federal funds the union will mark the fifth anniversary of 
the release of the nation at risk report with a protest tuesday 
in lafayette park across the street from the white house 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said theres no evidence that reform is working for 
any of our kids except maybe the 20 percent who have always made 
it in the traditional school system 
the education commission of the states has found that 45 states 
and the district of columbia have raised graduation standards since 
1980 the average high school student in 1987 had to take nearly 20 
units of credit to graduate up from 17 in 1980 
however the committee for economic development led by top 
business executives and the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching have concluded that school reforms have had 
little or no impact on urban schools 
the nation at risk report was prepared by the national 
commission on excellence in education a panel of 18 citizens 
appointed by thensecretary of education th bell in august 1981 
to address the widespread public perception that something is 
seriously remiss in our educational system 
the educational foundations of our society are presently being 
eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very 
future as a nation and a people the report said

a man who raped and savagely mutilated a 
teenage girl nine years ago will finish his parole monday paying 
his legal debt in full but its unlikely the crime will ever stop 
dogging him or haunting his victim 
i never live in the past lawrence singleton 60 said in a 
recent television interview but he continually argues that he was 
innocent and public outrage follows him wherever he goes 
ill never get over this says mary vincent singleton 
hacked off her forearms with an ax on sept 29 1978 and left her 
for dead in stanislaus county east of san francisco 
acquaintances say both convict and victim feel oppressed by the 
publics continued interest in them neither would consent to an 
interview 
vincent who lives in seclusion in the pacific northwest has 
said in published interviews that her fear has been revived by 
singletons impending freedom 
parole officials and singletons friends are concerned about his 
safety wherever he tries to settle when he was released a year ago 
on parole furious protests followed him from town to town when 
state officials tried to find a place for him to live he wound up 
in a mobile home on the grounds of san quentin prison and last 
week officials moved him to an undisclosed location 
heres a girl who lost her arms and will never get them back 
and heres the guy who did it he got 14 years and hes out in 
eight said stanislaus county district attorney donald stahl who 
prosecuted singleton 
there aint no justice its the thing i hear over and over 
and over from everyone he said 
singleton himself claims justice was not done insisting someone 
else attacked and maimed vincent who was hitchiking he also 
claims she attacked him 
but in 1979 a jury in san diego convicted the former merchant 
sailor of kidnap rape mayhem and attempted murder in the attack 
on vincent then 15 years old 
vincent was discovered naked with her forearms hacked off on a 
rural road 
she told police her attacker was a man named larry who picked 
her up in berkeley and told her he would take her to los angeles 
but instead took her to a deserted area near modesto she also 
identified singleton 
singleton was arrested 10 days later in sparks nev detectives 
found the burned remains of vincents clothes in the fireplace of 
singletons house in san pablo 
singleton was sentenced to 14 years and four months in prison 
then the legal maximum he was released early on parole in april 
1987 because of good behavior and work credits 
on monday singleton will be free to go wherever he likes and is 
under no obligation to tell prison officials where he is going 
thomas clyde smith jr pastor of bride of christ church in 
azalea ore said wednesday that singleton called him april 14 to 
accept his offer to let him join the church where he would have 
work and a place to live smith said singleton told him he planned 
to visit relatives in florida first 
parole officials have said singleton should be a lawabiding 
citizen if he is given a chance and if he continues to abstain 
from alcohol he was drinking heavily the day of the attack on 
vincent 
singleton took a polygraph test arranged by a local public 
television station on april 16 and his answers showed he believes 
the truth of his denials according to polygraph expert francis

the archbishop of nicaragua said 
sunday he believes the united states and sandinista government 
ultimately will hold talks despite president reagans staunch 
support of the nicaraguan rebels 
roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo said peace talks 
between the government and the rebels known as contras may be a 
prelude to bilateral talks between the sandinistas and the united 
states 
i am not a political expert he said but i believe that 
as the nicaraguan government moves toward democratization and it 
and the contras fulfill the peace agreements the time will come 
when the two nicaragua and the united states will sit down face 
to face 
remember that the same was said about the contra peace 
talks remember how the government here said the stars would fall 
from the sky before any talks it is a wise man that changes his 
mind 
obando y bravo who acted as mediator during initial talks 
between the rebels and government spoke with reporters after mass 
at the la sierrita church he was asked about president daniel 
ortegas request for talks with the united states 
ortega on friday said the two countries should resume 
discussions on matters of security in the mexican seaside 
resort of manzanillo the united states has not responded 
usnicaraguan talks were held in manzanillo in 1984 the 
reagan administration broke off the dialogue in january 1985 
the rebels and sandinistas signed a preliminary peace accord in 
the southern border town of sapoa on march 23 it called for a 
60day ceasefire that began april 1 during the truce the two 
sides are to attempt to negotiate an end to the 6yearold 
conflict that has cost more than 26000 lives 
they have held meetings recently in managua obando y bravo said 
he expected the second round of the contrasandinista peace talks 
in managua to begin as scheduled on thursday 
i believe that even though a peace treaty has not been signed 
much has been advanced i know the climate of the negotations from 
the beginning when things were very tense he said 
i think advances will continue to be made we are nicaraguans 
and we must reach a settlement our young people are tired of the 
war our people are tired of the war tired of scarcity tired of 
everything 
the cardinal is a member of the national commission on 
reconciliation and the verification commission established to 
determine if the two sides abide by the peace agreements

sexual harassment of women in the marine corps 
remains a problem that can be remedied by emphasizing that the 
practice will not be tolerated according to a marine corps report 
released sunday 
the task force on women in the marine corps said existing 
directives and the corps primary grievance system are 
appropriate tools to implement marine corps policy on this 
issue

female marines to embassy guard duty 
women account for about 10 percent of the nations 21 million 
military personnel by law they are excluded from combat 
the content of the pentagon report provided the basis of the

of life for female marines including solving the problem of 
shortage in uniform items and lengthy delays in filling special 
orders ensuring full investigation when homosexual conduct is 
suspected and allowing a pregnant marine to request a 30day delay 
in the notification of her commander by the medical officer 
the task force also recommended that the navy surgeon general 
review the policy regarding the assignment of obstetricians and 
gynecologists to combat service units and the commandant review 
the number of women medical and dental personnel assigned to 
various units 
the navy surgeon general also should publish information 
regarding oral contraceptives for men recreational programs should 
be expanded and additional child care centers be built the report 
said 
the commandant approved all the recommendations with the 
exception of pregnancy notification and oral contraceptives for men

leftist guerrillas stormed a highland 
farming hamlet held a mock trial and killed 20 peasants to avenge 
the slayings of three rebels police said sunday 
in lima two policemen were shot and killed saturday as they 
walked their beat in a working class neighborhood according to 
officials 
police blamed both attacks on members of the maoist shining path 
movement which has been fighting for eight years to topple the 
government 
about 30 guerrillas attacked the farming community of aranhuay 
on wednesday and ordered some 200 people to attend a trial in 
the village square police reported 
they said gunmen wearing peruvian army uniforms pulled 20 men 
from the crowd and shot them after accusing them of being members 
of a selfdefense patrol 
aranhuay is 30 miles north of ayacucho which is 230 miles 
southeast of lima police said the account of the massacre came 
from peasants who fled to ayacucho seeking protection 
they said the refugees told them the guerrillas were seeking to 
avenge the deaths of three shining path members killed when the 
aranhuay peasant patrol aided army troops in a clash with rebels in 
february 
the shining path has killed hundreds of members of selfdefense 
patrols since the units were organized by the military in 1984 
civil rights groups and opposition politicians have accused the 
military of abandoning the patrols which are frequently armed only 
with pitchforks and knives 
the government says more than 10000 people including nearly 
600 policemen have been killed in violence related to the shining 
path insurgency

socialist president francois mitterrand won the 
first round of the presidential election sunday setting up a may 8 
runoff with conservative premier jacques chirac who finished a 
distant second 
with 98 percent of the ballots counted and with tabulating 
suspended for the day mitterrand had 34 percent of the vote in his 
quest for a second sevenyear term chirac 55 had 199 percent 
former centerright premier raymond barre 64 finished third 
with 165 percent he conceded defeat and called on his supporters 
to back fellow conservative chirac and oust mitterrand 
making a strong showing in the field of nine candidates was 
jeanmarie le pen 59 leader of the extreme right national front 
with 145 percent le pen campaigned on a tough antiimmigration 
platform 
the big loser was communist party candidate andre lajoinie 
whose 68 percent showing was the lowest in the history of the 
party that has been on a steady decline since 1981 
turnout in the election was estimated at 82 percent compared to 
81 percent in the first round of the 1981 elections 
the 71yearold mitterrand whose popularity sank to 
unprecedented lows at midterm only to soar in the last two years 
in two weeks will face the harddriving premier who has run the 
government since conservatives won the 1986 legislative elections 
now the choice is simple mitterrand said in a brief 
statement to all of you who serve france we have before us 
great tasks frenchwomen and frenchmen let us rally together 
neglecting no effort to win may 8 
chirac in a joint appearance with barre at the senate building 
called on unity among conservatives to unseat mitterrand 
now against the socialist candidate we must rally 
together he said 
mitterrand organizers were jubilant as the returns rolled in 
by placing francois mitterrand well in front in the first 
round the voters have shown the direction for rallying the country 
on may 8 said pierre beregovoy mitterrands campaign manager 
mr jacques chirac is far behind said beregovoy his 
policy has left many people unhappy and disappointed 
the final polls a week ago had showed mitterrand defeating 
chirac by a comfortable margin in the second round 
the president is the chief of state the premier elected by the 
legislature is the head of government 
sundays vote marked the first time a president and premier have 
opposed one another in a presidential election the french have 
called the unusual governing arrangement cohabitation 
the polling was something of a test for the national front 
which has emerged as a major political factor in the past four 
years le pen was hoping to solidify the gains of his party and its 
antiimmigrant and lawandorder stands 
le pen who said he would announce his stand on the runoff 
during a political rally on may 1 was elated with his tally sunday 
we have the certainty of a political earthquake and a radical 
transformation of the national landscape he said nothing will 
ever be done in france without the voters of the national front 
otherwise the campaign had contained little real political 
debate the absence of major differences on the main issues turned 
the election into a contest of personalities 
unlike 1981 when voters faced a clear rightleft choice between 
mitterrand and valery giscard destaing this election was more 
subtle mitterrand abandoned revolutionary rhetoric of earlier 
years for mainstream themes in an effort to broaden appeal 
chirac also pledged to open his government to a wider range of 
ideas 
the two firstround leaders now have two more weeks to convince 
the voters mitterrand will be seeking communist and other extreme 
left votes as well as nibbling at the center chirac will be 
fighting for his share of the center and the extreme right 
rounding out the ninecandidate field was antoine waechter 39 
an ecologist with 38 percent pierre juquin 58 leader of a 
splinter communist reformist group 21 percent arlette laguiller 
48 head of the trotskyist worker struggle movement 2 percent and

national front leader jeanmarie le pen staked his 
claim to frances future after his farright views attracted 
thousands of voters in sundays first round of the presidential 
election 
le pen drew 145 percent of the vote with 98 percent of the 
ballots counted and led all nine candidates in marseille his 
southern stronghold and frances thirdlargest city 
le pen said his followers could decide the outcome of the may 8 
runoff between socialist president francois mitterrand who 
finished first in sundays balloting and conservative premier 
jacques chirac the runnerup 
nothing will ever again be done in france without the voters 
of the national front le pen said on national television 
we have the certainty of a political earthquake and a radical 
transformation of the national landscape 
running on an antiimmigration platform that asked voters to 
choose between a french france and a third world france le 
pen ran better than polls had predicted making the national front 
the strongest extremeright party in europe 
he said he would announce the national fronts voting strategy 
on may 1 during a demonstration to honor joan of arc 
le pen 59 who announced his candidacy a year ago portrayed 
himself as an outsider with a chance to finish among the top two 
candidates in the elections first round 
but throughout the campaign he emphasized his potential to sway 
the outcome of the final round 
his campaign against immigration forced other candidates to 
address the delicate issue sometimes at their expense 
officials of chiracs rally for the republic party have been 
conferring with the national front in search of an accord for the 
second round according to french press reports 
national front secretarygeneral jeanpierre stirbois said his 
party will be very attentive to what chirac has to propose on 
immigration and the death penalty the national front wants the 
death penalty restored 
le pen has said he would not be willing to accept a ministerial 
post saying only the presidency or the premiership will show the 
french that things have truly changed 
if the vote confirms the tendency indicated by the polls in 
the future it will be difficult to speak of the national front as 
an ephemeral extreme right current le monde newspaper wrote in 
its saturday edition 
le pen a whitehaired breton and former paratrooper founded 
the national front in 1974 but the group remained on the political 
fringe for years 
it entered national legislative elections in 1986 and now holds 
33 of the 577 national assembly seats

a student of street culture says gang members 
rounded up in police sweeps against gang violence probably consider 
their arrests a badge of honor 
police have arrested about 4000 people in sweeps between feb 
26 and thursday of which about 2000 have been identified as gang 
members or associates police spokesman cmdr william booth said 
sunday 
gang members caught in a sweep probably will brag about the 
experience and make being caught a way of getting esteem and 
prestige said diego vigil a university of southern california 
anthropologist and author of the book barrio gangs street life 
and identity in southern california 
in a recent interview vigil said gang members wind up looking 
on it an arrest as an adventure it gives them something to talk 
about when they get out 
assistant police chief robert vernon who is supervising the 
sweeps strongly disagreed 
if a gangbanger knows that every time he identifies himself 
as a gang member hes going to do three or four days in jail he 
stops being overt about it he doesnt want to go to jail every 
weekend he wants to party and have fun vernon said 
statistics support the effectiveness of the sweeps vernon said 
the sweeps began in late february in march of this year we had 
16 killings and in march of the prior year there were 26 he 
said 
some observers expressed concern that the crackdown violates 
civil rights 
attorney r samuel paz chairman of the hispanic advisory 
council to the police commission and a los angeles aclu board 
member said the dragnets which target people wearing gang colors 
or other identifying clothing remind him of the zoot suit 
roundups of the 1940s in which hispanics were arrested largely 
because their clothing set them apart from others 
people are willing to say let them stop all the kids 
thats my real concern paz said that could be my kid 
but vernon said that some gang violence is caused by gang 
members clothing 
in driveby shootings quite often the person they kill 
theyve never seen before they shoot at the colors vernon said 
they just say theres one of them get him

emily begins with an unctious jason toasting 
his date emily they have known each other a week she proposes 
marriage and he scrams fast 
in the first of many asides lisa banes as emily 
enthusiastically explains that that is the way she gets out of 
relationships without hurting anybody 
emily opened sunday at the offbroadway manhattan theater 
club author stephen metcalfe an associate artist at the old globe 
theater in san diego has taken a look at the romantic problems of 
a liberated single young woman in new york 
lisa banes is a sensitive yet vigorous actress who was last seen 
in new york in on the verge a play about selfsufficient women 
of the 19th century she makes the inconsistent sometimes 
strongheaded and unkind emily seem adorable 
emily who earns big money on wall street is very interested in 
men and sex but never in love before she falls for jon a waiter 
and outofwork actor a handsome blond from minnesota 
emilys four wall street colleagues are ever giving her advice 
contradictory cynical or silly 
in the plays funniest scene she climbs into the audience from 
which she interrupts jon in his acting class 
emily wins jon but their apparent growing commitment scares 
her so she proposes he accepts but it is not happy ending time 
for this liberated young woman 
melcalfe makes clear that it is not a difference in salaries 
that comes between them or emilys career ambitions and he makes 
jon almost miraculously saltoftheearth midwestern feet on the 
ground while able to put his love into romantic words 
he drops only hints of emilys problem but spells it out at the 
end her parents divorced when she was 3 and she never learned 
selfesteem or how to love or how to tell somebody her deepest 
feelings 
the wellchosen cast of 10 is directed in lively fashion by 
gerald gutierrez sets around manhattan mostly of backwall 
projections are by heidi landesman 
but due to author metcalfe and miss banes at the end of the 
play one does not dismiss it as about just another poor little 
yuppie girl but instead sighs poor emily

general motors corp is dropping firestone 
tire amp rubber co as a supplier of tires for new gm cars and 
trucks which account for about 20 percent of firestones us 
production the companies said sunday 
the unexpected setback comes as firestone shareholders prepare 
to vote monday on a 26 billion buyout offer from bridgestone 
corp of japan although firestone said the gm move would not 
affect the merger plans 
firestone stated that it learned of gms planned phaseout on 
friday there was no immediate comment from bridgestone 
john j nevin chairman and chief executive of firestone said 
in a news release he was surprised and disappointed by gms 
move but said firestone was confident it would find other markets 
for its tires without hurting profits 
gm plans to reduce firestones role as a supplier significantly 
during the second half of this year and will eliminate the 
tiremaker from its supply base over a period of up to two years 
firestone stated 
gm spokesman james crellin said in a telephone interview in 
detroit that the move was part of the automakers ongoing 
supplierrationalization study a periodic review of suppliers 
capacity and future needs and indicated it was not linked to the 
impending buyout by bridgestone 
weve got four other tire suppliers general tire goodyear 
michelin and uniroyalgoodrich crellin said there are no 
plans to look for another supplier at this time we will be 
informing the other four tire suppliers of the availability of 
increased business 
crellin declined to say how long the phaseout would take and 
that it was gms policy not to discuss the amount of business it 
does with any suppliers 
gms biggest tire supplier is uniroyalgoodrich which supplies 
about 34 percent of its tires according to estimates by the trade 
publication modern tire dealer goodyear is second at 225 percent 
firestone is third with 20 percent general tire was fourth at 175 
percent and michelin was fifth at 45 percent according to the 
publication 
chicagobased firestone is the nations secondlargest tiremaker 
after goodyear tire amp rubber co with tires accounting for nearly 
70 percent of its 42 billion in annual sales 
firestone said it has told ford motor co of gms move and was 
authorized to say in its news release that ford has no plans to 
change its relationship with firestone its fourthlargest tire 
supplier 
firestone agreed in march to be acquired by bridgestone for 80 
a share after it became the target of an unsolicited offer by 
italys pirelli spa 
firestone had agreed in february to sell 75 percent of its 
worldwide tire business to bridgestone for 15 billion but 
terminated that venture after pirelli launched its attempt to 
acquire the entire company 
in agreeing to acquire firestone bridgestone indicated the 
merger would help it become a global tiremaker in addition to its 
production and marketing capacity the japanese company cited 
firestones role as an original equipment supplier bridgestones 
weakest area to ford and gm as a rationale for the acquisition

european tourists are flocking to south 
florida this year lured not only by sun beaches and attractions 
such as disney world but also by a weak dollar that has cut the 
cost of such getaways 
last time i came the dollar was really high and we lost a lot 
of money said gabriella heurlin of sweden comparing her 
familys 1984 trip to the united states with their april visit to 
florida you were always checking money and saying my god how 
expensive but not this time now you just buy 
loads of shopping we bought hundreds of tshirts said 
brigitte haskins of surrey england as she toted stuffed shopping 
bags through miami international airport to catch a plane home 
local resort association executives say that 20000 brochures 
sent to their london tourism office to tout package trips to miami 
beach were gone in 10 days 
the requests coming in are phenomenal said murray gold 
executive director of the miami beach resort hotel association 
we never expected it 
since the dollar started sinking in february 1985 increasing 
the buying power of foreign currencies the united states has 
become increasingly attractive as a vacation spot for foreign 
tourists 
in march the dollar fell to its lowest monthly average since 
november 1978 on the federal reserves tradeweighted index of 18 
major currencies 
the state does not track foreign tourism but larry schultz of 
the federal reserve bank in atlanta said the bank estimated 
floridas foreign tourism increased by between 25 and 30 percent 
last year over 1986 
in the first 11 months of 1987 341 million people vacationed 
in florida said chip coggins of the state division of tourism up 
from 337 million in all of 1986 december 1987 figures were not 
available 
tourism officials here note that although foreign tourists often 
travel to attractions like disney world and daytona beach that are 
further north the miami area a key arrival point for 
international travel is regarded as a primary destination 
of the 679 million tourists in dade last year 418000 were 
european visitors a 366 percent increase over foreign tourism in 
1986 said bill anderson of the greater miami convention and 
visitors bureau 
the falling dollar is a major factor anderson said 
tourism pumped 49 billion to the county economy last year and 
occupancy rates totaled 715 percent for dades 56990 hotel and 
motel beds this year officials expect a 5 percent to 7 percent 
rise in tourism said anderson 
in neighboring broward county hoteliers saw a slight increase 
over last year especially among british and west german tourists 
although specific numbers were not available said broward tourism 
bureau statistician bruce laster 
in dade countys miami beach local tourism officials hope the 
dollars decline will be their summertime salvation 
miami beach has turned a circle and become a hot resort 
again said gold whose group represents about 150 motels and 
hotels for years we were down in the dumps 
golds association last year opened an office on buckingham 
palace road in london to sell oneweek packages with prices 
starting at 160 including hotel a rental car a oneday cruise 
and jaialai tickets 
the packages aim to pull in united kingdom tourists during the 
slow season of april 10 to dec 15 when blistering daytime heat 
and steamy nights drive off winter tourists 
some south florida tourist attractions also are noticing more 
foreign accents lately 
im hearing french german and japanese everywhere said 
michael finley superintendent of the 14 millionacre everglades 
national park he said he expects europeans to account for about 80 
percent of summer business at the parks flamingo lodge

the protracted labor strife at texas air corp has 
given way to a publicity battle that the company portrays as a 
counterattack to a wellorchestrated union campaign of negative 
publicity 
texas air and its eastern airlines unit have been blaming 
agitation by labor leaders at eastern for recent critical scrutiny 
and investigations by lawmakers the news media and political 
candidates 
it has been a very wellorchestrated campaign and with the 
political environment and the pressure on the faa over increased 
passenger complaints and safety concerns industrywide we were a 
perfect target said eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak in miami 
houstonbased texas air has responded with ads in national 
newspapers news conferences special mailings to travel agents and 
an unusually high profile by chairman frank lorenzo 
the negative publicity may have peaked earlier this month with 
the federal aviation administrations announcement of an 
unprecedented investigation of texas airs finances and management 
and a concurrent safety inspections of its eastern and continental 
airlines fleets 
the company apparently was stunned by the wide publicity given 
the union leaderships longtime claims that lorenzo was out to 
bust the unions cannibalize easterns assets and pressure 
employees into ignoring safety problems 
in some cases the unions issues and allegations just made 
good copy said texas air spokesman bruce hicks in houston 
and youve certainly got a very political year 
democratic presidental candidates michael dukakis richard 
gephardt and al gore jr all have spoken out against eastern 
management which also has been the topic of critical congressional 
hearings 
eastern pilots last year launched a maxsafety campaign in 
which pilots sent anonymous postcards detailing safety problems to 
the faa easterns machinists and flight attendants unions also 
repeatedly have alleged that eastern management has been reducing 
safety measures taken by the company 
their claims and examples have been the subject of national 
magazine newspaper and television network news stories on eastern 
safety and management 
after the faa announcement eastern president phil bakes who in
