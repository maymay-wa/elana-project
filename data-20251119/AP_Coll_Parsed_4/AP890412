the government on wednesday declared a 
weeklong ceasefire with sinhalese and tamil rebels and an 
official said 26 sinhalese militants surrendered under president 
ranasinghe premadasas peace plan 
the militants belonging to the marxist peoples liberation 
front gave themselves up at temples and government offices 
wednesday said the military official who cannot be identified 
under briefing rules he did not give details 
premadasa seeking to end six years of ethnic violence that has 
claimed 12500 lives announced a general amnesty and unilateral 
ceasefire to sinhalese and tamil rebels 
the offer was part of a peace package that included seats in 
parliament and jobs for the militants the ceasefire began a day 
before sinhalese and tamils celebrate a common new year 
the government also set up 228 centers at schools temples and 
government offices across the country where the rebels could give 
themselves up 
the front has not yet responded to the truce offer but the 
largest tamil militant group campaigning to set up an independent 
state in northern and northeastern provinces rejected it outright 
tuesday 
however the militants have a week to surrender and it is too 
early to make a decision about the response to the surrender 
call the military official said 
no militants surrendered in the capital the chief priest of 
buddhist temples in colombo said nobody turned up at the 
shrines where reception centers were set up for receiving the 
rebels 
an official at a reception center in weligama 85 miles south of 
colombo said on the telephone we have a whole lot of armed 
police here but nobody to surrender 
the south is the sinhalese heartland where the marxist rebels 
are most active the extremists have been blamed for more than 
2500 political killings since january and most of the victims have 
been government officials and security men 
the militants have been trying to topple the government since 
july 1987 when it signed a peace accord aimed at ending the tamil 
separatist campaign 
the leftwing extremists say the accord gave the minority tamils 
too many concessions they also say the presence of indian troops 
deployed to disarm the tamil rebels and enforce the 1987 accord 
compromises the countrys independence 
an indian high commission or embassy offical said indian troops 
will continue to carry out operations against the tamil rebels 
but the troops will not hinder the process of surrendering 
said the offical who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
the dominant tamil rebel group liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam said tuesday we will not agree to any ceasefire so long 
as the indian army remains in sri lanka 
india became involved in the conflict because of the sympathies 
of its own 60 million tamils to the rebel cause 
tamil militants launched a campaign in 1983 for an independent 
homeland citing discrimination by the majority sinhalese in 
employment and education 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
most live in the northern and northeastern provinces where they 
want their homeland sinhalese make up 75 percent of the islands 
population and control the government and military

february by several guerrilla groups told a news conference 
wednesday that the entire cabinet would move within the next two 
to three days some ministries to asadabad capital of kunar and 
others to a site still be decided in paktia 
hekmatyar was in singapore on an eightnation tour to seek 
recognition for his government malaysia announced tuesday if will 
formally recognize the interim government 
mohammad karim khalili spokesman of the iranbased guerrillas 
said at a news conference in tehran that forces in the city of 
meidan near kabul and in ghazi and areas to the north of the 
capital are preparing to start operations and soon a new front 
will be opened near kabul tehran radio reported 
the guerrillas are split into the iranbased shiite coalition 
and the larger sunni alliance based in pakistan the two have been 
at odds over the formation of a guerrilla government in which the 
shiite alliance is not represented

the guerrillas known as mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
have been fighting nearly 11 years to topple afghanistans marxist

alleges is flowing to the guerrillas illegally from pakistan

council debate and if that was not possible then to steer the 
debate on the right course russian interference in afghanistan 
afghanistans ruling marxists charged in an emergency session of 
the security council tuesday that pakistan was waging a 
fullfledged war against kabul and intervening in the war by 
sending pakistani army and milita to the battlefront pakistan

authorities found 12 male bodies in 
graves at a ranch just south of the mexican border tuesday and said 
the victims were sacrificed by a satanic cult of drug smugglers 
it was horrible cameron county sheriff alex perez told a 
news conference in this border city it was like a human 
slaughterhouse 
mexican federal judicial police arrested four people said 
sheriffs lt george gavito gavito said the suspects were us and 
mexican citizens but did not identify them further 
the dead found by the federal police included 21yearold 
university of texas student mark kilroy who vanished during his 
spring break last month while in the mexican city of matamoros 
gavito said 
kilroy apparently was chosen at random by drug smugglers who 
hoped human sacrifices would protect them from harm gavito said 
he was taken after the cult members were told to pick one anglo 
male that particular night the lieutenant said 
the cult had been involved in human sacrifices for about nine 
months he said and prayed to the devil so the police would not 
arrest them so bullets would not kill them and so they could make 
more money 
authorities found candles and kettles full of body parts and 
animal bones said oran neck chief us customs agent in 
brownsville 
a small color snapshot displayed at the news conference showed a 
caldron containing a dark red liquid and what appeared to be 
bones another picture showed 12 body bags 
authorities would not identify the other victims but said all 
were males 
one grave held three bodies another contained two said neck 
some victims were shot in the head while others appeared to have 
been slain with machetes or sledgehammers the agent said 
the bodies were found tuesday morning in a field about 20 miles 
west of matamoros gavito said 
ive been an investigator 15 years and its one of the worst 
things ive ever seen he said 
kilroys brain was missing said brownsville herald photographer 
anthony padilla who said he saw the body at a matamoros funeral 
home there was nothing inside the skull padilla said 
in some forms of witchcraft removal of the brain signifies a 
sacrifice of the victims soul 
padilla said kilroys legs were cut off at midcalf and his 
spine was severed and twisted 
kilroy a premedical student vanished from a crowded matamoros 
street shortly after 2 am on march 14 while on a drinking foray 
with a group of friends in matamoros a city of 180000 just across 
the rio grande from brownsville 
law officers on both sides of the border were stumped with no 
clues to kilroys disappearance despite an intensive search the 
questioning of nearly 100 people and a 15000 reward 
the 3footdeep grave containing kilroys body was found after 
mexican federal police alerted us officials early tuesday that 
they had obtained confessions from the suspects officials said 
at least one of the suspects admitted involvement in kilroys 
death said neck 
the students parents helen and james kilroy of santa fe 
texas arrived in brownsville on tuesday following the grisly 
discovery 
gwen huddleston the mother of one of the students with kilroy 
the night he vanished took the kilroys to the airport for the trip 
helen kilroy of course is very upset after finding out the 
news that it really was mark down there she told ktrktv in 
houston later they went down there in hopes that it wouldnt be 
but it didnt turn out that way 
authorities refused to talk about the evidence or pinpoint the 
location of the grave the area was sealed gavito said 
the case is being investigated by customs the us attorney 
generals office mexican federal authorities and local law 
enforcement agencies on both sides of the border 
it was the third drugrelated mass killing discovered near the 
border in less than three weeks 
on march 29 mexican authorities found the bodies of three women 
and six men on an abandoned ranch near agua prieta mexico just 
across the border from douglas ariz 
five were at the bottom of a well and four in an earthen septic 
tank all nine were bound and had been tortured and mutilated 
officials said mexican and us investigators said the slayings 
were drugrelated 
on april 1 the bodies of three more men killed in similar 
fashion were fished from the well all were believed to be mexican 
nationals 
on march 27 two people from arizona and three from the mexican 
state of sonora were found bound and stabbed in a shed in tucson 
those deaths were also called drugrelated 
officials said thursday it was possible the tucson and the agua 
prieta cases were linked 
herbal medicine and the use of witch doctors or curanderos 
is common in mexico most markets in mexico city have stalls where 
herbs are sold for cures to cast or remove good or bad spells or 
to cleanse a home of evil 
human sacrifice common in the countrys precolumbian indian 
cultures is little known now but is not unheard of it is said to 
be used occasionally in rituals in which one person is killed as 
part of curing another one such case was reported earlier this 
year in mexico city

imagine andrew lloyd webber or stephen sondheim 
not allowing songs from their latest musicals to be recorded or 
played on the radio or performed in nightclubs and cabarets 
jerome kern issued such an edict after the opening of sitting 
pretty his 1924 musical written with guy bolton and pg 
wodehouse 
why the ban 
kern was a man who wanted his music played the way he wrote it 
and not jazzed up or distorted by popular renditions he was a 
perfectionist although some musical comedy historians think the 
prohibition may have been a ploy by kern to create more interest in 
the show 
if it was it didnt work despite generally good reviews the 
musical had a disappointing run of only 95 performances and 
promptly was forgotten eiht or nine of its songs were published 
but much of the score disappeared until it was unearthed in a 
secaucus nj warehouse seven years ago 
now sitting pretty returns to new york for five performances 
in a concert version at carnegie recital hall april 13 through 
april 16 it will be conducted by john mcglinn the man behind the 
recent complete and critically praised recording of show boat 
the concerts performed with a 23piece orchestra and an 
18member cast star davis gaines jason graae kim criswell and 
paige ohara 
for mcglinn sitting pretty is a labor of love a chance to 
perform a musical not heard in new york for 65 years 
nobody knows the score at all said mcglinn who considers 
the work an important transition piece a bridge between kerns 
less serious early musicals and his masterpiece show boat 
robert russell bennett who orchestrated many of kerns 
musicals would sometimes refer to sitting pretty in interviews 
saying that it was something that people someday should hear again 
because it was special he said 
mcglinn first heard the music in 1980 when bill tynes of the new 
amsterdam theater company let mcglinn raid his sheet music 
collection 
it was so different and so beautiful and on an emotional 
plane so far removed from many of the other things kern was writing 
at the time he said this score has the deepest emotional 
depth of anything he wrote until show boat 
i dont know what part of himself kern dug down into to create 
this score and i should say wodehouse did as well because the 
lyrics are as moving and emotional as a lot of the music 
the creators didnt get it from the frivolous plot concocted by 
wodehouse and bolton which involves twin orphans who fall in love 
with the real and adopted sons of a wealthy old man 
its extraordinary because there is this wild dichotomy 
between the book and parts of the score which are really emotional 
songs like there isnt one girl a year from today and the 
magic train its the real thing when the music starts playtime 
stops mcglinn said 
i think it comes from the fact that kern by 1924 was ready 
to flex his muscles and when he saw opportunities to write truly 
emotional music he went for it 
sitting pretty remained unperformable until the secaucus 
discovery where a full score for the show as well as a lot of 
kerns working sketches were found 
the carnegie concerts will also include 95 percent of the shows 
dialogue mcglinn discovered a late draft of the script in the 
museum of the city of new york between that script an early copy 
filed at the library of congress in washington and the full scores 
found in secaucus he was able to piece together a book for the 
performers to use 
kern has been a major preoccupation of mcglinns for a long 
time in 1985 he did concert versions at carnegie of kerns oh 
boy oh lady lady and zip goes a million 
besides show boat mcglinn has a recording of kern 
overtures including sitting pretty coming out in may on 
emiangel he also has a complete version of cole porters 
anything goes waiting for release on the same label his other 
upcoming projects include new recordings of porters kiss me 
kate and possibly irving berlins annie get your gun 
for the moment though hes concentrating on kern and the 
concert version of sitting pretty 
musical comedy buffs will savor one number in particular the 
title song it was dropped a week into the musicals original run 
because leading man dwight frye had a minor speech impediment 
when frye sang i like to sit just sit and sit and sit with 
you the whole day through it sounded according to kern 
biographer gerald bordman embarrassingly different mcglinns 
concerts should rescue the song

a group of middleclass men concerned that 
friends were dying and nothing was being done met in greenwich 
village eight years ago 
they called themselves gay mens health crisis they had little 
money and less clout there was no name for the disease that 
brought them together 
today gay mens health crisis has a 10 million budget its own 
sixstory manhattan building and 2000 volunteers and the disease 
has a name acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
after years of hectoring politicians and public health officials 
to address the problems of people with aids gmhc and its cohorts 
are themselves being challenged to cope with the changing face of 
that population 
nationwide more than 87000 cases of aids have been reported 
about twothirds of them among homosexual or bisexual men but in 
many cities especially along the east coast someone diagnosed 
with aids today is about as likely to have become infected by 
shooting up with dirty needles as through sex 
in new york city intravenous drug abusers comprised an 
estimated 45 percent of all newly reported aids cases last year 
these projections bear out what we have long known that the 
spread of aids is fueled by drugs and that aids is accelerating 
its onslaught upon poor drugravaged neighborhoods and minority 
communities said city health commissioner stephen joseph 
in new jersey iv drug abusers comprised 59 percent of new aids 
cases 
what this means to aidsservice providers is only now being 
addressed 
san francisco with the most people with aids per capita of any 
us city wins praise from all quarters for its response to the 
epidemic 
its shanti project a peercounseling group for the terminally 
ill had one staffer in 1982 and was nearly defunct now it has a 
3 million budget and a paid staff of 70 directing counseling 
groups and a housing program geared toward independent living for 
people with aids 
but greg day shantis education director notes that about 96 
percent of aids cases in the city are among gay males who used to 
lead relatively normal lives were employed full time and have a 
firmer footing in society 
i think that because the impact of aids has been primarily 
overwhelmingly on the gay community thus far we have succeeded so 
far in developing our resources along with the epidemic he said 
we dont have the answers yet on how to best serve the iv 
druguser population 
the situation is similar in los angeles seattle minneapolis 
and other cities where the number of iv drug users is relatively 
small experts say 
in chicago things are more difficult 
what were dealing with here in chicago particularly when 
were dealing with the issue of homelessness and destitution is 
not the gay community but blacks minorities iv drug users 
prostitutes and their families people of the streets basically 
said al mascia of travelers and immigrants aid a private group 
that helps house homeless people with aids 
while we want to adopt some of the programs or utilize some of 
the models that san francisco has were talking about working with 
a different population for the most part mascia said 
part of the problem is that an iv drug user does not 
automatically kick the habit when diagnosed with aids but most 
aids organizations require infected drug abusers to enter treatment 
before they are accepted as clients 
its fine for us to deal with you as someone with arc 
aidsrelated condition or aids said tim sweeney gmhc deputy 
director for policy but the truth is if youre just leaving our 
front door and going out and sticking another needle in your arm 
were really not doing you any big favor 
youve got two illnesses to be dealt with 
programs such as gmhc and the shanti project depend on 
volunteers but sweeney said we are finding now that the 
volunteer model really doesnt work with them they need much more 
direct intense case management much more involvement usually by 
a professional staff person to help them set up the structure of 
their life so that theyre independent 
the drug abuser also is more likely to be homeless yet shelters 
are no place for someone infected with aids several cities run 
apartments for people with aids capable of independent living but 
demand far outstrips supply 
people with aids who no longer need hospitalization but have no 
place to go often are sent to singleroomoccupancy hotels where 
they have no medical supervision and must contend with seedy 
surroundings and crime 
many are discharged from the hospital and can sit on the bench 
out front said larry ellis of lifelink a washingtonbased aids 
organization 
in new york a lucky few find room in the highly praised 
privately run bailey house the citys only supervised aids 
residence it opened in 1986 with rooms for 44 people and hopes to 
add nine more rooms by the summer of 1990 
for lawrence conklin 38 a 20year heroin and cocaine addict 
diagnosed with aids about two years ago a clean nicely furnished 
room at bailey house and a treatment program was the only thing 
that saved me 
yet even bailey house has evicted several residents because of 
drugrelated problems said its administrator gordon hough 
we consider ourselves a humane society and i dont think we 
should doubly punish a person whos already suffering said diane 
doherty a member of the national coalition for the homeless board 
i would be hard pressed to make the argument that every single 
program has to accept people who go off the wagon perhaps 
what we need maybe is a house in a community where people who 
cannot stop have a place to go 
gmhc also wants to see a range of services targeted at specific 
populations but sweeney said his organization despite its 
position as the nations largest private aidsservice organization 
cant be expected to be all things to all people gay and bisexual 
men still make up 80 percent of gmhcs caseload of 2500 
hivinfected people and just taking care of that burden alone is 
extremely daunting he said 
some former volunteers and other aids activists have criticized 
gmhc for among other things not sharing more of its resources 
with smaller groups but sweeney said gmhc doesnt want to appear 
arrogant 
were real conscious of our limitations we believe in 
empowerment we believe in communities taking care of themselves 
and getting the resources and asserting their own leadership 
the future is to get a bigger pie and to get other people 
involved with the disease a lot of the policy and advocacy work 
that were doing is around this issue of budgets and getting money 
out to communities who dont have the access and the political 
organizing skills that we do 
i think we are around for a much longer fight than maybe some 
people anticipated

air and water pollution have 
reached crisis proportions in east germany and western experts sy 
pollutants are taking a heavy toll in west germany as far as the 
north sea 
west german officials are considering an offer of money and 
technology to help the east german communist government clean it up 
the water quality of the elbe river is particularly critical 
when it reaches west germany said karl huthmacher a spokesman 
for the west german environmental protection ministry air 
pollution has also reached dangerous levels 
the greenpeace ecological groups west german branch said the 
elbe carries wastes to the north sea where plant and animal life 
are seriously threatened and destroyed 
it also said human health is also increasingly at risk from 
contaminated drinking water 
in leipzig and many east german cities power plants using 
highsulphur brown coal belch out huge clouds of smoke that stings 
the eyes and coats buildings with black soot heavy exhaust fumes 
from cars trucks and buses further foul the air 
western studies indicate that east germany pumps more pollution 
into the atmosphere than any other country in europe including 
nearly 5 million tons a year of sulphur dioxide according to west 
german surveys 
after the oil price rises in the 1970s east germany 
increasingly turned to its considerable brown coal reserves 
statistics on the extent of pollution are not made public in 
east germany but the government is under pressure to release them 
an east german ecological group called the green network arche 
has demanded that the government stop treating evidence of 
environmental pollution as state secrets 
underground ecology newspapers detailing local pollution 
problems are frequently seized 
while east german officials have shown an increased willingless 
to work with west germany on environmental problems western 
experts say they are still a long way from concrete and effective 
measures 
working groups from both sides are still working to come up 
with an acceptable program to help reduce the problems said 
marlene muehe a spokeswoman for the west german environmental 
ministry in bonn 
east german officials said at a recent environmental conference 
in east berlin that a number of new projects had been launched to 
reduce river pollution and that the elbe river would likely be 
cleaned up by 1992 
hans reichelt east germanys minister for environmental 
protection was quoted in the staterun media as saying that all 
new and refitted power plants would be equipped with filtration 
devices beginning next year 
but west german officials say that in order to make any 
substantial progress soon west germany will have to provide the 
east germans with technology and financial assistance 
while east germany was the first eastern european nation to 
enact strict environmental laws the guidelines are rarely 
enforced western officials say 
west german government studies indicate that cleanup tasks will 
be difficult because east germany has largely abandoned 
environmental protection programs in recent years 
the last two fiveyear plans have contained neither a detailed 
environmental program nor funds to carry out projects outlined in 
earlier plans a west german government study said 
because of increasing economic pressures east germany has 
made industrial growth and increased production a priority over 
environmental protection 
west german officials who are grappling with the heavily 
industrialized nations own formidable environmental problems say 
the east german pollution is of grave concern 
our own efforts to correct environmental problems are made 
significantly more difficult because of the east german 
pollutants environmental protection ministry spokesman 
huthmacher said in bonn referring to efforts to clean up the 
nations rivers and to reduce emissions that cause acid rain 
west germanys forests have suffered considerable damage because 
of acid rain 
environmental experts also say east german factories dump tons 
of untreated industrial wastes into waterways where it mixes with 
the runoff from fields treated with nitrate fertilizers 
many major rivers flow into west germany 
according to greenpeace more than 100 tons of waste including 
heavy metals industrial sludge raw sewage and pesticides flow 
into the elbe river each day in east germany

for 11 days guido casciano has 
fought the battle of sawmill bay riding herd on wave after wave of 
oil with his nimble 27foot fishing boat 
for 11 nights he has slept in the boats tiny cabin so hed be 
ready at first light to continue the deadening routine of coralling 
oil away from the salmon hatchery up the bay 
its fairly boring but hopefully were doing some good 
here he said 
casciano and his fellow fishermen have done some good but their 
rescue of the hatchery is a brief skirmish in a losing fight to 
limit the damage of 10 million gallons of crude oil spilled from 
the tanker exxon valdez 
its really frustrating when you consider what little youre 
accomplishing with all the effort here said gary raymond who 
had his 48foot sound adventure working with cascianos commitment 
on monday when you think about what little oil youve picked up 
it blows your mind 
the view from above prince william sound speaks to the seeming 
futility of the cleanup effort 
the lower end of the sound is a checkerboard of oil rainbow 
swirls of oil nudge the shore in the hundreds of lonely bays and 
inlets mudcolored oil streamers stripe the deep green water of 
the open sound 
the powerful forces of nature have taken mans mistake and 
scattered it hundreds of miles 
no one knows this better than fishermen like casciano and 
raymond neighbors from cordova who have looked to the sound for 
their living 
while officials dusted off contingency plans and held assessment 
meetings the fishermen of the sound streamed out of towns like 
cordova and seward to do what they could 
most went without knowing they would be compensated for their 
efforts casciano and raymond were at sawmill bay for five days 
before they received contracts from exxon the only contact they 
have had with the company responsible for the spill 
all of us figured that if nothing else at least were out 
here doing something said casciano 
the independent fishermen organized their own battle plan booms 
were floated across the inner bay the fishing boats took what 
materials they could get and began collecting the oil using the 
same techniques they have used for years for fishing 
a yellow oilsmeared boom was attached at one end to 
commitment the other to sound adventure using hand signals and 
radio calls the two boats moved in graceful ballet until clumps of 
oil resembling greasy brown oatmeal were snared in the boom 
the strategy is similar to the way two boats can use seining 
nets to trap schools of salmon and herring 
the oil was then floated to a sucker boat a navy skimmer 
that sluices the oil from the water and into a small barge 
but often over the past two weeks there has been no skimmer to 
feed the special boats can only swallow 32 barrels of oil before 
their tanks are filled and they have to go unload 
whatever the fishermen are paid for the effort will fall short 
of the cost of what the spill may do their way of life 
raymond lost at least 40000 when the spill canceled the 
herring harvest in normal times his wife and daughter would be on 
the boat with him for weeks helping catch fish 
carolyn raymond was aboard sound adventure on monday after 
flying out to be with her husband everybody back at town is 
worried that our way of life may be over she said 
both the raymonds and casciano are pessimistic about what their 
efforts mean against the massive amount of oil and unrelenting

as dusk descends on this seaside 
village men light kerosene lamps and women keep conch shells handy 
for a night vigil against the enemy a ballistic missile 
it is not from an enemy country 
chandipurs 12000 villagers want to stall the testfiring of 
indias first longrange ballistic missile 
they say it is potentially dangerous and eventually will make 
them homeless they fear the missile named agni which means 
fire in hindi may carry nuclear warheads 
the testfiring scheduled later this month will bracket india 
along with the united states the soviet union france britain and 
china in ballistic missile capability military experts say 
it also will enhance the power of indias 136 millionstrong 
army and the countrys geopolitical influence in the region they 
say 
it is more a technology demonstration but it can be used in 
defense should the country require said vs arunachalam who 
has overseen indias defense research since 1982 
will it carry nuclear warheads he asked if you want you 
can carry a nuclear warhead even on a bullock cart 
since april 1987 india successfully has tested three types of 
surfacetoair and surfacetosurface missiles with ranges varying 
from 5 to 155 miles 
villagers in chandipur are being lured with money and promises 
of free food and popular film videos if they leave their homes 
during launch time and move to temporary camps set up in the area 
but they refuse to budge and the battle of wits shows no sign 
of settlement 
at the maximumsecurity launch site on the bay of bengal about 
300 scientists and technocrats are putting final touches to the 
missile 
they expect it to travel between 370 miles and 1550 miles a 
scientist said on condition of anonymity the missile will carry a 
oneton payload 
the project is one of great national importance lt gen 
rs deswal chief of national test range said in an interview 
this is what we are telling the villagers 
military testfiring is nothing new to this village where the 
colonial british set up an arms and ammunition test range 95 years 
ago 
scientists have been experimenting with two other missiles that 
were testfired in 1987 and in 1988 
but what sparked the controversy surrounding the new missile was 
an official announcement earlier this year asking villagers to 
vacate their homes 
for the past three years we are asking the government what is 
happening said arun dey a former legislator who heads the main 
antimissile group their stock reply was nothing major just 
routine firing and enlarging the facilities now out of the blue 
they are telling us that they will fire a real big missile 
most chandipur residents are fishermen or farmers who arrived 
here after the 1942 bengal famine which killed up to 1 million 
people 
let them fire the missile but we not going to leave our 
homes said gaur singh of the chandipur peoples protection 
committee they will have to fire a missile first at us and then 
they can fire another at the sky 
we have said we will not go he said we maintain a 
nightlong vigil because we fear that they may force us out 
conch shells are blown to alert people in other hamlets 
the government wants the people living in a twomile radius of 
the launch pad to vacate their homes for four hours during the 
launch 
but villagers fear it is a ploy 
we are not asking them to leave for good just during the 
launch period said the general who said officials have offered 
every adult 520 and each child 260 as compensation 
singh said it is good money no doubt but should you trade 
your existence for that

a housewife is appealing a 25 fine for airing her 
bedding after 10 am saying the 30yearold law that prohibits 
the practice is outdated 
the woman has enlisted the help of a biochemist to back her 
claim that heavy pollution during morning rush hour makes it 
impossible to air her bedding legally genevas la suisse 
newspaper reported 
under 1955 public hygiene regulations in geneva anyone living 
in an urban area who hangs duvets or carpets out of windows or over 
balconies in public view after 10 am can be fined 
the clause which remained in obscurity made headlines in swiss 
newspapers tuesday when the housewife identified only as claudine 
appealed the fine she received after a zealous policeman spotted

last year the ncaa championship basketball game 
gave cbs a rare first place for the week in the ac nielsen co 
television ratings 
this years game in which michigan defeated seton hall by one 
point in overtime was in the top 10 but it wasnt enough to knock 
nbc out of first place where it has been for 42 straight weeks 
nbc won the week that ended sunday with a 154 rating cbs had a 
130 and abc 125 for the season nbc has a 160 rating abc 129 
and cbs 126 
the week was fairly typical except that the onset of daylight 
saving time seemed to affect the earlier shows since viewers tend 
to be less eager to plop in front of the tube when its still light 
outside 
therefore the cosby show which starts off the night for 
nbc on thursday found itself in second place behind abcs 
roseanne which is broadcast an hour later on tuesday night 
even though cosby had a bigger share of the audience 
roseanne had the highest rating 233 but a 35 share 
cosby had a 224 rating but a 38 share the rating is a 
percentage of the nations 94 million homes with television the 
share is a percentage of sets actually in use 
daylight saving time also affected the news ratings all were 
down somewhat abc world news tonight was first with a 101 
rating and a 20 share slightly ahead of the cbs evening news 
with a 99 and 20 share nbc nightly news had an 89 and 18

sunday night where it had a 62 and 10 share last week only two 
other primetime shows both on abc rank lower heartbeat and 
men even fox had three shows with higher ratings than 
moonlighting 
cbs got a soso performance out of the premiere of the robert 
guillaume show which finished 46th 
abc won the sunday movie battle with a repeat of romancing the

tom bradley was the early leader in his 
campaign for a historic fifth term as mayor of the nations 
secondlargest city capturing 54 percent of the absentee vote in a 
race characterized by low voter turnout 
bradley 71 the citys first black mayor needed at least 50 
percent of the vote to avoid a june 6 runoff 
fortyfive minutes after the polls closed at 8 pm bradley was 
in the lead with 13146 absentee ballots or 54 percent according 
to the city clerks office 
the nextclosest contender was freshman city councilman nate 
holden who received 5014 absentee votes or 2066 percent former 
los angeles county supervisor and television commentator baxter 
ward had 4800 votes or 197 percent 
although virtually no observers believed the mayor could lose 
one newspaper reported that a secret poll conducted by bradleys 
campaign last week showed the mayor with just 53 percent of the 
vote 
bradley pollster richard maullin told the los angeles herald 
examiner that the polls conducted april 2 and 3 contained questions 
checking the impact of a city attorneys office ethics 
investigation of bradley 
but maullin said none of the results showed tom bradley not 
winning outright 
city clerk lee martinez had predicted a 25 percent to 30 percent 
turnout a historical low for a mayoral election voters faced 
morning low clouds and drizzle and the turnout by 4 pm was only 
116 percent of the citys 19 million registered voters 
a poll taken recently by the los angeles times showed 78 percent 
of hispanics 70 percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a 
favorable impression of the democratic mayor 
that led bradley to be dubbed the teflon mayor because he 
is apparently not blamed for the citys mounting urban problems 
the only currently elected official challenging bradley 
freshman city councilman nate holden was considered his only 
serious opponent in the nonpartisan race but hardly a threat to 
the 16year mayor 
other candidates included a former county supervisor a 
socialist oil field worker and a singerdancer who used to cavort 
in a green bikini across the street from city hall every day 
the winner of tuesdays mayors race will oversee los angeles at 
least into the early 1990s leading a city with a population that 
is swelling past 3 million people 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
pollsters and wouldbe opponents such as city councilman zev 
yaroslavsky agree that bradleys lowkey image has kept him from 
being linked in voters minds with los angeles growing problems 
including criminal gangs illegal drug trade traffic congestion 
and a failing sewage system 
yaroslavsky had widely been considered bradleys leading 
challenger but backed out of the race after apparently deciding 
that he couldnt win 
bradleys image even appeared untarnished by an ethics 
investigation by the city attorneys office which learned that the 
mayor had performed consulting work with far east national bank 
which did business with the city 
bradley returned the 18000 in fees he was paid by the bank and 
called the charges politically motivated 
bradley the son of a texas sharecropper and the grandson of 
slaves was first elected mayor of los angeles in 1973 
a track star at the university of california at los angeles he 
first entered public service as a los angeles police lieutenant 
and later was elected to the los angeles city council 
he was defeated in his first run at mayor in a bitter 1969 race 
against incumbent sam yorty that critics said was tinged with 
racism but came back to beat yorty the next time around 
at the end of his current term bradley will become the first 
mayor in los angeles history to have served four full terms 
he has run twice for governor but was defeated in 1982 and 1986 
by republican george deukmejian

budget negotiators from the bush 
administration and congress are turning to accounting gimmicks and 
asset sales for a major portion of their budget package after 
failing to reach agreement on strong deficitreduction steps 
the group is struggling to wrap up more than a month of talks 
aimed at shaving about 28 billion from the fiscal 1990 deficit 
that would reduce red ink to about 100 billion next year as 
mandated by the grammrudman law according to white house 
estimates 
budget experts agree that any longterm solution to the huge 
deficit problem requires a meaningful shift in fiscal policy 
translation either significant new taxes or reductions in federal 
programs or a combination of the two 
but with president bush opposing new taxes or cuts in military 
spending or foreign aid and the democraticcontrolled congress 
sure to reject deep cuts in domestic programs the negotiators are 
able to only nibble at the edges of major policy changes this year 
that scenario has been reinforced directly in recent days as 
members of the negotiating team have presented ideas to their 
constituencies in the white house or on congressional committees 
in many cases theyve been told to look elsewhere to reduce the 
deficit or face rejection said sources familiar with the 
closeddoor meetings 
so in an effort to avert a crisis such as violating 
grammrudman and triggering its automatic spending cuts the talks 
have turned increasingly toward the smoke and mirrors approach to 
budgeting 
they are considering 
moving payment of some farm subsidies ahead so the checks are 
written this fiscal year instead of next a shift that makes fiscal 
1990 look nearly 1 billion trimmer 
taking the us postal service offbudget knocking nearly 
2 billion in red ink off the books next year 
making an accounting change in the food stamp program to 
save another 500 million 
selling off nearly 6 billion in government assets a policy 
which often brings in money at first but then costs money in the 
long run 
other items on the list that take advantage of federal 
accounting methods include claiming credit for 2 billion trimmed 
from the medicare program by simply extending existing cost 
controls and about 600 million by continuing a retirement policy 
for federal employees 
the group is even prepared to claim 100 million in savings 
because congress earlier this year rejected a pay raise for itself 
and other top federal officials according to one source 
rep leon panetta the chairman of the house budget committee 
declined to discuss any specifics but conceded the negotiators 
were struggling 
weve got to reach this goal in a credible way and its not 
easy he said under the circumstances we are working with we 
are reaching the best possible solution 
but he added theres no question that this package is 
going to send a message that more needs to be done 
the budget negotiations have dragged on longer than planned and 
congress will not meet its april 15 deadline for passing a budget 
resolution the budget serves as a blueprint for congress annual 
spending bills and tax legislation 
under the grammrudman law if the president and congress fail 
to enact legislation that will reduce the deficit to within 10 
billion of next years 100 billion target the administration must 
make acrosstheboard spending cuts to make up the difference

foreign buyers are gobbling up huge amounts of 
the us corn supply but domestic livestock feeders are easing 
back on use of the mighty feed grain 
a new supplyanddemand analysis by the agriculture department 
showed tuesday that corn exports may total 21 billion bushels in 
the marketing year that began last sept 1 the new forecast was up 
by 100 million bushels from indications a month ago and 21 percent 
more than the 173 billion shipped in 198788 
exports at that level would be the highest since corn shipments 
totaled 24 billion bushels in 198081 
about 4 billion bushels of corn are expected to be used as 
livestock feed this year down from 43 billion forecast in march 
and well below the record of 474 billion bushels consumed a year 
earlier 
according to usda records that would put feed use at the lowest 
since 382 billion bushels were fed to livestock in 198384 
corn is the largest and most important field crop grown by 
american farmers as livestock feed it helps produce the bulk of 
the meat poultry and dairy products that reach consumers 
the us stockpile at the beginning of the new corn marketing 
year this coming sept 1 is forecast at 183 billion bushels up 
from the 166 billion bushels indicated in march 
last sept 1 before the droughtshriveled 1988 corn harvest was 
added to the supply the corn carryover was 423 billion bushels 
with a reduced supply corn prices shot up from an average of 
194 per bushel in 198788 to a projected range of 245 to 270 
this season 
the us wheat carryover on june 1 the beginning of the new 
wheat marketing year was indicated at 549 million bushels up 
slightly from 534 million forecast last month but far below the 
126 billion bushels in the inventory last june 1 
wheat exports and domestic use are down but the main impact has 
been the reduced 1988 harvest wheat prices are expected to average 
365 to 380 per bushel this season up from 257 in 198788 
the soybean situation reflects a barebones level of supply 
with the carryover on sept 1 the beginning of the 198990 
marketing year expected to be about 145 million bushels compared 
with 302 million last sept 1 
drought reduced last years production forcing prices higher 
the report forecast soybeans might average 720 to 760 per 
bushel this season compared with 588 in 198788 exports and 
domestic use are both down 
the report also said that total meat production this year is now 
expected to be about 02 percent less than forecast last month 
because of a decline in poultry prospects even so 1989 combine 
production of poultry and red meat is expected to reach a record 
level

the agriculture department says a vaccine has 
been invented to make pigs piggier 
pigs immunized with the experimental vaccine ate an average of 
225 pounds more feed and gained 11 pounds more weight than pigs 
without the treatment the departments agricultural research 
service reported on tuesday 
if a commercial product results from this venture and is 
approved by regulator agencies it could mean more quality pork 
produced at lower cost and in less time said animal physiologist 
jerome c pekas 
the usda agency has signed a threeyear cooperative agreement 
with codon a san francisco biotechnology firm for development and 
further testing of the vaccine 
pekas who works at the agencys meat animal research center in 
clay center neb said the vaccine is made partly from a fragment 
of cholecystokinin a natural appetitelimiting hormone made in the 
upper intestinal tract of pigs and humans 
when the fragment called cck8 is joined to a larger foreign 
carrier protein the animals immune system recognizes the fragment 
as a foreign molecule and produces antibodies that block the 
natural cck hormone he said 
when that happens there is nothing to tell pigs when theyve 
had enough to eat so they keep on eating

the agriculture department says the orange 
harvest for the 198889 crop season is estimated at about 2078 
million boxes down 1 percent from the march forecast but 4 percent 
above last years production

at 1443 million boxes down 1 percent from last month but 5 
percent more than last season the departments agricultural 
statistics board said tuesday

almost 2 percent from the march forecast but 2 percent more than 
produced in 198788 the arizona crop was indicated at 155 million 
boxes down 22 percent from the previous forecast for arizona in

a new sightseeing business has arrived on the 
scene in the nations capital guided tours conducted by president 
bush 
bush has been taking his guests to see the sights something 
predecessor ronald reagan rarely did 
for egyptian president hosni mubarak it was a trip by 
helicopter to nearby baltimore for a baseball game there the two 
presidents sat in a box and ate hot dogs and hamburgers and debated 
bushs highandoutside seasonopening pitch 
for israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir it was a trip past 
the tidal basin for a glimpse of the citys famed cherry blossoms 
and then to the air and space museum one of washingtons 
mostvisited attractions 
the two joined springtime tourists in the museums widescreened 
theater to watch the movie to fly excited conversation rippled 
through the audience as people realized who was in their midst and 
those who had cameras used them for snapshots 
next week jordans king hussein will be in town and its 
anyones guess where the president might take him 
washington is a city of 1000 monuments said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater we may end up visiting them 
all 
bush plans to take french president francois mitterrand to his 
vacation home in kennebunkport maine next month 
and he threw open the doors of the presidential retreat at camp 
david md to house speaker jim wright dtexas 
bush set the theme early in his presidency when he opened the 
white house to the public the saturday after his inauguration and 
at one reception for members of congress bush used a polaroid 
camera to take instant photos of lawmakers in the lincoln bedroom 
on the way to the air and space museum the bushshamir 
motorcade passed a line of lifesized standup photographs that have 
proliferated in washington over the past few years 
for instance for a 5 fee you can have your picture taken with 
a cutout of president bush the first lady or both in the final 
photograph it looks like you were standing next to the first 
family in front of a washington landmark 
at the white house there have been such cutouts for several 
years first the reagans and now the bushes for a while a cutout 
of oliver north also appeared but popular demand trailed off and 
it has been removed 
but outside the air and space museum george and barbara bush 
now share sidewalk space with other celebrities including cutouts 
of wrestling star hulk hogan and actor tom selleck and a new 
addition soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
it would have been hard for bush to miss the lifesized likeness 
of the soviet leader gorbachev was right on the corner just feet 
from the official motorcade 
but if the president had any reaction it went unreported 
the president is often out and about town frequently taking 
guests with him in his limousine 
and since he has a habit of stopping at red lights when hes on 
a social or recreational call his motorcade often produces 
expressions of surprise and delight from other motorists and 
passersby as they realize the man in the stopped car alongside them 
is none other than the president 
those on the street might have done a double take one day last

terrorism rose to record heights in 1988 as 
the united states suffered a substantial increase and israel 
remained the favorite target the state department reported to 
congress 
the bombing of a pan am jetliner in december over scotland 
which the departments office of counter terrorism said probably 
was a terrorist incident and the palestinian uprising on the west 
bank and in gaza helped push the total of incidents to a new high 
of 856 up 3 percent from 1987 
in all 658 people were killed and 1131 wounded an increase in 
fatalities from 633 in 1987 but a decrease in injuries from 2272 
the casualty figures include terrorists themselves who were 
killed or wounded during attacks as well as attacks by afghanistan 
against pakistan a us ally which funneled american weapons to 
afghan guerrillas 
in all the citizens and property of 79 nations were attacked in 
60 countries businessmen and tourists accounted for 77 percent of 
the victims the weapon used most often by terrorists was the bomb 
it was used in 48 percent of the attacks said the report released 
tuesday 
the armys top uniformed lawyer contends that the us military 
can legally attack terrorists without violating a 1976 presidential 
order that bans assassinations of individuals abroad 
maj gen hugh overholt the services judge advocate general 
argued in an eightpage draft memorandum that because of changes in 
the nature of the threat action against terrorists can be 
justified on grounds of national selfdefense 
overholts memorandum was disclosed monday by the newsletter 
defense week and confirmed by army officials 
the state department report said the united states remained a 
primary target for international terrorism last year as the number 
of antius incidents rose from 149 in 1987 to 185 they resulted 
in 192 persons killed and 40 wounded compared with seven americans 
killed and 47 wounded in 1987 
the increase in deaths was due largely to the attack on 
usbound pan am 103 in which 259 people aboard the jumbo jet and 
11 on the ground perished of the victims 189 were americans 
latin america was the area showing the largest percentage of 
incidents against us citizens and property 60 percent 
on the whole the middle east again had the highest incidence of 
international terrorism with 313 attacks israel including the 
west bank and gaza again was the main target accounting for 29 
percent of the attacks 
the state department credited syria and iraq with a substantial 
reduction in direct involvement in terrorism last year but said 
both countries continued to provide safe haven and training to 
terrorist organizations 
irans decision to end its war with iraq and expand ties to the 
west lessened iranian involvement in terrorism but iran continued 
to include terrorism among its foreignpolicy tools the report 
said 
at years end 20 foreigners were listed as political hostages 
being held in lebanon two others possibly were dead while 13 were 
released during the year 
ranked behind israel in order as sites for the most terrorist 
incidents were pakistan colombia spain lebanon west germany 
zimbabwe south korea peru and france 
the 10 countries accounted for 75 percent of the incidents 
during the year the report said 
the palestinian uprising which began in december 1987 and 
continued through last year in the israeliheld west bank and gaza 
strip should be viewed overall as a civil insurrection the 
state department said 
but the report said since it contained elements of terrorism 
in some instances all civilian casualties were included in the 
1988 statistics

public housing officials say hud secretary 
jack kemps antidrug proposals may help in some housing projects 
but what they really need is more federal money to beef up security 
and help tenants find jobs 
hes not suggesting anything that has not been thought of in 
the past they just havent had the resources said richard 
nelson executive director of the national association of housing 
and redevelopment officials 
weve got a lot of handwringing going on but no help said 
gordon cavanaugh counsel for the council of large public housing 
authorities i havent seen any money yet 
the secretary of housing and urban development proposed this 
week a series of steps for fighting drugs in federally supported 
housing projects in washington he said they are applicable to 
every public housing authority in the united states and will be 
issued in action memos to all locally run public housing 
authorities 
kemps package includes only one direct hud action dropping 
government hearing procedures that may delay eviction of tenants 
who use or sell drugs so long as the tenants receive due process 
in the courts 
his other proposals were suggestions including more police 
patrols installing security fences around projects establishing 
guarded entrances renovating the projects and requiring photo 
identification cards for residents 
he provided no cost estimate but said he would go to congress to 
ask for more money if needed 
district of columbia officials on tuesday formally asked hud to 
drop its requirement for hearings before evicting tenants for drug 
use or firearm violations 
but some housing officials said the move might not be possible 
in some states and that it might not speed up the eviction process 
very much in others 
in baltimore housing authority spokesman bill toohey said the 
hearing process works well and keeps most cases from ever going to 
court we are not about to change our grievance procedures 
he said 
cavanaugh said many of the nations 3000 public housing 
authorities might want to drop the hearing procedures but that the 
more serious delays in evictions are in the court system and would 
not be changed 
jane lang of the housing and development law institute said laws 
in some states do not appear to provide enough protection for 
tenants in eviction cases to meet hud guidelines for waiving the 
formal hearing procedures 
the proposal to fence in housing projects will be controversial 
and likely will be rejected in most cases according to nelson 
whose organization represents 90 percent of the local public 
housing agencies that operate federally subsidized housing 
he said a main concern of public housing agencies is making 
projects blend in with the surrounding neighborhoods and fencing 
would only make them stand out and be even more attractive to drug 
activity by outsiders 
kemp acknowledged on monday that fences may not work in all 
cases and said they should be considered on a casebycase basis 
a security fence may be different from barbed wire kemp 
said were not trying to keep people in were trying to get 
drug users from getting in 
in new york city housing authorities have no plans to require 
residents to have photo identification cards or to surround 
projects with fences said val coleman spokesman for the city 
housing authority he called the steps draconian 
were not that demoralized coleman said 
coleman said new yorks need is for more money to increase its 
public housing authority police force and to provide job training 
for tenants 
but some other cities including washington have already begun 
issuing photo identification cards in certain cases such as for 
tenants of highrise and seniorcitizen projects 
mayor arthur holland of trenton nj president of the us 
conference of mayors praised kemps enthusiasm and said most of 
his suggestions could be useful but he cautioned that increasing 
security in projects may only move drug problems into surrounding 
areas unless broader programs are provided to poor urban residents

the interior department although conceding 
possible environmental problems is renewing longterm water leases 
to farmers in central california in an attempt to put to rest an 
emotional fight over federal water in the west 
the controversy over water distribution to central california 
farmers has been marked by disagreement within the administration 
for months environmentalists have characterized the outcome as 
another barometer on the bush administrations desire to protect 
the environment and natural resources 
the interior department which issues the leases has favored 
automatic renewal while the environmental protection agency has 
argued that a formal environmental assessment should first be made 
the presidents council on environmental quality is planning to 
review the matter thursday 
but interior secretary manuel lujan jr announced tuesday that 
he has decided to renew the first lease to come before the 
department committing federal water to the orange cove irrigation 
district in the san joaquin valley for another 40 years 
lujan said the decision would not affect the white house 
councils proceedings the council has no authority to block the 
leases or order a formal environmental impact statement although 
its views historically have been given considerable weight by 
agencies and congress 
this decision further corrodes the environmental credentials 
of the bush administration said rep george miller dcalif 
chairman of the interior subcommittee on water power and offshore 
energy resources 
while the lease renewal announced tuesday involves only one of a 
number of central california irrigation projects it was viewed 
widely as an indication of how the interior department likely will 
deal with future renewal cases as other longterm leases expire 
environmentalists have opposed renewal of the longterm leases 
because the commitment locks the government into supplying a 
certain volume of water to farmers well into the next century at a 
time when rapid population growth is creating new nonfarm water 
demands 
as water continues to be diverted for both agriculture and urban 
use streams will dry up and seasonal wetlands which support 
migratory waterfowl will disappear the critics maintain 
the leases provide for water delivered through the friant unit 
of the central valley project a massive central california 
irrigation system that each year provides 15 billion acre feet of 
federal water to central california farms and orchards through an 
elaborate system of dams and canals 
lujan in a statement conceded that the longterm leases may 
pose legitimate environmental concerns but he said those 
concerns could be resolved by state and local officials 
he directed the chief of the bureau of reclamation to conduct an 
environmental assessment and provide it to those officials for 
consideration so the state and local officials may then adopt 
environmentally sensitive operating procedures and water policies 
but richard sanderson director of the office of federal 
activities at the epa suggested lujans procedures for dealing 
with environmental concerns amount to sidestepping the national 
environmental policy act under which environmentalists had sought 
to get a formal environmental impact statement or eis before any 
leases were renewed 
the environmental review directed by lujan is essentially 
different than doing an eis said sanderson in an interview 
our position at epa is the entire water issue for california 
needs to be reviewed in light of todays environmental standards 
and particularly the environmental requirements 40 years hence 
sanderson added 
randall block an attorney who represents several environmental 
groups including the natural resources defense council and the 
sierra club in challenging the lease renewals in a lawsuit filed in 
california accused lujan of undermining the procedures 
established to deal with the environmental concerns 
its kind of backward to sign the leases and then order and 
environmental assessment block said 
lujan suggested that the issuance of the one lease renewal would 
not affect the white house environmental councils review of the 
broader environmental issues involving all of the upcoming leases 
he also said the orange cove lease would encourage increased 
water conservation among the farmers by charging substantially 
higher prices for the water under the new contract with orange 
cove the cost of federal water would quadruple from 350 to 
1494 per acre foot he said 
an acre foot is an amount of water need to flood an acre of land 
one foot deep or about 350000 gallons

the federal aviation administration is moving 
to impose new maintenance standards on older airliners but 
industry officials say the agency needs to do a more thorough job 
of inspecting the aircraft 
the senate aviation subcommittee examined the problem of aging 
airliners at a hearing on tuesday a session that also produced a 
warning from the panels chairman that tougher government 
regulations might be on the way 
the chairman wendell ford dky told reporters after the 
session that congress should consider requiring the faa to force an 
increase in the frequency of inspections of older aircraft require 
replacing certain parts rather than examinations of them and set 
training and experience standards for airline inspectors and 
mechanics 
ever since the roof of a 19yearold aloha airlines boeing 737 
peeled off over hawaii last april sweeping a flight attendant to 
her death attention has been focused on the older aircraft 
the faa and the nations major airlines agreed in february to 
more than 800 million worth of improvements to be made on 1300 
older boeing jetliners the goal is to eliminate certain routine 
inspections in favor of design improvements and a schedule for 
regular replacements of certain parts 
on tuesday anthony j broderick the faas associate 
administrator for regulation said that late this month or in early 
may the agency will propose rules that would require more than 160 
structural changes in boeing 727s 737s and 747s 
the last year has been a difficult one for the older members of 
the us airline fleet nine people died in december when a 
19yearold united airlines boeing 747 broke open over hawaii a 
22yearold eastern airlines boeing 727 landed without casualties 
after a hole opened in its fuselage while flying over west 
virginia and an 8yearold piedmont airlines 727 lost an engine 
during takeoff from chicago 
the average age of airliners used by us carriers is 127 
years up from 8 years in 1980 it is expected to be 15 years by 
the year 2000 because there are backlogs of orders for new 
aircraft and an evergrowing passenger load 
at the hearing officials from the faa the airlines and the 
aircraft manufacturing industry assured lawmakers that improvements 
were being made constantly in how aircraft are constructed 
maintained tested and inspected 
but benjamin a cosgrove a vice president for engineering for 
boeing commercial airplanes a boeing subsidiary said faa 
inspectors should spend more time examining airlines and less time 
checking paperwork and complained that faa fines for maintenance 
infractions can be counterproductive 
routine use of such penalties tends to drive problems 
underground and communication in the industry suffers cosgrove 
said 
clyde kizer engineering vice president for the air transport 
association which represents the major airlines said the group is 
considering whether inspectors and mechanics for all carriers 
should be required to meet uniform training standards 
this angered ford who asked why should there be any question 
but that you should go ahead with strict training and education

a house committees vote to impose a new 
fairness doctrine on broadcasters sets the stage for a 
confrontation with the white house and a probable supreme court 
challenge 
the house energy and commerce committee issued the challenge 
tuesday when on a voice vote it approved a fairness doctrine bill 
introduced by committee chairman rep john dingell dmich 
the bill goes to the full house where it is expected to pass 
easily 
the justice department has told dingell that it will urge 
president bush to veto any fairness doctrine law that passes 
congress 
president reagan vetoed an identical bill in 1987 the same year 
the federal communications commission repealed its doctrine on the 
grounds it violated the first amendment and no longer served the 
public interest in an era of diverse media outlets 
the 50yearold rules required broadcasters to air opposing 
views of controversial issues 
if the bill should pass both houses of congress and become law 
a supreme court test also would seem likely because of what 
opponents say is the doctrines unconstitutional infringement on 
broadcasters rights 
a federal appeals court earlier this year ruled that the fcc had 
the authority to scrap the doctrine but the court sidestepped the 
issue of the doctrines constitutionality 
rep edward markey dmass chairman of the energy and commerce 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance said the fairness 
doctrine is not a great burden on broadcasters and only assures 
more speech on public issues 
the bill would not impose criminal sanctions on broadcasters who 
violate the doctrine markey said adding that a station never has 
lost its license for fairness doctrine infractions 
the committees ranking republican rep norman lent of new 
york said the bill is designed to provide a minimal assurance of 
fair play 
opponents included rep tom tauke riowa who said this is a 
clear violation of the first amendment he also disputed the view 
that broadcasters must be required to be fair because they are 
licensed to exploit a scarce medium the airwaves 
our founding fathers had the question before them do we want 
a fair press or do we want a free press and they made the choice 
that we ought to have a free press tauke said 
there were at that time very few media outlets in the 
nation he said and of course then as today it was abundantly 
clear that some of those media outlets sometimes engaged in 
activities which were perceived may actually have been unfair 
but the founding fathers said there was a greater risk in 
attempting to control the media by imposing fairness than there is 
in permitting a free media to perhaps occasionally be unfair 
the fairness doctrine has been opposed by many broadcasters 
particularly smaller station owners who say the threat of lawsuits 
is enough to make them just play music instead of discussing 
controversial issues

a spectacular fivealarm fire tuesday 
destroyed a roofing materials warehouse forced the evacuation of 
nearby buildings and injured two warehouse workers slightly 
firefighters said 
the blaze sent a towering column of smoke over the suburban area 
between seattle and tacoma knocked out electricity to downtown 
auburn and snarled traffic as stoplights went dark and motorists 
slowed for a glimpse of the flames 
four other buildings in an area of more than 100000 square feet 
also were engulfed in flames 
an undetermined number of people were evacuated from four nearby 
businesses and firefighters hosed down a house across the street 
that was threatened by the flames 
no firefighters were hurt although shifting winds blew sparks 
and flaming tarpaper around the leatherback industries inc 
warehouse 
mike dehart of the kent fire department said the smoke could 
pose a threat to area residents with respiratory problems most of 
the smoke was blown to the south but some stayed in the area 
the fire apparently started around 230 pm near an electrical 
panel but the cause remained undetermined authorities said 
damage initially was estimated at about 1 million 
fire officials estimated it would take the 75 firefighters from 
five jurisdictions at least 12 hours to extinguish 
the building contained large amounts of felt paper and tar to 
make tarpaper for roofing said an auburn fire department spokesman 
who refused to give his name 
its hot and its nasty he said 
asphalt stored at 300 to 400 degrees in the warehouse had only 
to get a bit too hot to burst into flames he said 
two leatherback workers were treated for minor burns after 
trying to extinguish the fire earlier in the day officials said 
the blaze spread despite a sprinkler system and the two workers 
and nine other employees fled workers said 
several tanks of industrial chemicals exploded firefighters 
tried to prevent flames from reaching a 61000gallon tank of 
liquid asphalt and a large propane tank

country people were just as poor during the 
economic recovery as they were during the last decades recession 
according to a study that found little difference between urban and 
rural poverty 
the study poverty in rural america a national overview said 
more than one in six people in rural america fell below the federal 
poverty line of 9056 for a family of three in 1987 while the rate 
was one in eight for residents of metropolitan areas during that 
year 
in fact the rural poverty rate for 1987 the fifth year of 
an economic recovery was as high as the rate for 1975 the 
deepest recession year of the 1970s said robert greenstein 
director of the center for budget and policy priorities while 
presenting the study tuesday to a hearing of the house select 
committee on children youth and families 
using data from the us census bureau on poverty from 1978 to 
1987 the center for budget and policy priorities found that the 
rural poverty rate rose from 135 percent to 169 percent 
in metropolitan areas during the same period the rate rose from 
104 percent to 125 percent metropolitan areas comprise one or 
more cities and their suburbs 
in the central cities which frequently are associated with 
poverty the rate climbed from 154 percent to 186 percent 
according to the study 
whats most striking is that the rate of poverty in rural 
areas is almost as high as in central cities greenstein said 
tuesday in an interview 
the center a nonprofit organization which conducts research and 
analysis on a range of public policy issues concerning lowincome 
families and individuals found the changes in poverty consistent 
among most racial ethnic age and demographic groups 
the rural poor are more likely to be white because there is a 
lower proportion of minorities in nonmetropolitan areas but more 
than twofifths 441 percent of nonmetro blacks were poor in 
1987 compared to onethird 333 percent of blacks living in 
central cities 
there also were more poor elderly people living in rural than 
urban areas the study said 
the only segment of the rural poor that was smaller than its 
urban counterpart was children according to the study 231 
percent of rural children were poor while 296 percent of the 
children in the central cities were poor in 1987 
but one feature that distinguished the rural poor from their 
urban counterparts is that rural poverty is likely to occur in 
twoparent families where one or both parents work 
nearly two of every three poor families living in rural areas 
contained at least one worker in 1987 the study said nearly 
one quarter had at least two workers

witchcraft is not uncommon in mexico where 
open air markets sell magic amulets and powders and where one can 
easily hire a witch to cast a spell on a rival 
but an anthropologist consulted tuesday said satanic rituals are 
rare police believe such rituals were performed in the killings of 
12 people in the northern border city of matamoros 
the bodies including that of a 21yearold university of texas 
student were discovered in a mass grave tuesday on a ranch just 
south of the usmexico border 
police said a satanic cult of drug smugglers killed them in 
hopes that human sacrifice would protect them 
this is the most horrible thing ever seen in the citys 
history said enriqueta hernandez a reporter covering the story 
for the matamoros daily el bravo this is more like something you 
would hear about in veracruz or oaxaca 
the southern states of veracruz and oaxaca are known for their 
large numbers of brujos or witches and their occult rites 
but even in those areas the rites are not considered 
satanic because they have no connection with the christian 
devil the witches may sacrifice animals such as blackfeathered 
roosters but ritual killings of human beings are almost unheard of 
american anthropologists william and claudia medsen 
differentiate between mexicos traditional indian witches and what 
they call satanic witches in their 1969 book the american 
guide to mexican witchcraft 
the satanic witchcraft practiced in cities and towns is a far 
cry from indian witchcraft although this distinction has been 
ignored by anthropologists they wrote indian witchcraft has 
little or no connection with the christian devil who dominates the 
suburban sorcery scene 
the most feared witches in urban mexico are those who make 
pacts with the devil a satanic witch voluntarily sells his soul to 
the devil in exchange for wealth and power the book says 
an anthropologist at the national anthropology and history 
institute said satanic cults are rare in mexico because they are 
elitist and expensive in part because of drugs used in the 
ceremonies 
from colonial times it never was successful in mexico said 
the anthropologist who asked that her name not be used 
on the other hand herbal medicine and use of witch doctors 
called curanderos is common in mexico most markets have 
stalls where herbs are sold for cures to cast or remove good or 
bad spells or to cleanse a home of evil 
human sacrifice was common in the countrys precolumbian indian 
cultures the aztecs killed thousands every year usually captured 
enemy soldiers and practiced cannibalism 
human sacrifice is little known now although not unheard of it 
is said to be used occasionally in rituals in which one person is 
killed as part of the process of curing another 
tomas rojas a police reporter for the mexico city tabloid la 
prensa said one of the few cases he had heard of involved the 
slaying of an unidentifed man whose headless body was discovered 
about three months ago next to a hill in the northern part of the 
city 
rojas said officials found the body near a circle of stones 
enclosing a triangle the head was found on the other side of the 
hill

fire swept through an apartment house early 
tuesday killing seven children and two young mothers and police 
later arrested a homeless man but did not link him to the blaze 
the three other occupants of the building were injured two of 
them seriously 
fire chief g john parker said the cause remained under 
investigation and authorities were focusing on a gas heater near 
where the fire started parker said that based on an initial 
investigation authorities did not suspect arson 
the blaze started about 2 am on the first floor and had 
engulfed the twostory woodframe structure by the time 
firefighters responded 
the fire was just blazing all of a sudden i cant 
remember hearing noise or anything said rhonda tracy a 
relative of several of the victims who lived across the street and 
was first to call the fire department at 220 am 
i had never seen people come out burned like that she 
continued i was just hysterical 
police and fire authorities aided by arson investigators from 
the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms were examining 
the rubble in a workingclass neighborhood in this central illinois 
city of about 130000 
smoke detectors were found upstairs and down parker said but 
the downstairs detector was connected directly to the buildings 
wiring and electricity service had been cut april 4 by central 
illinois light co he was uncertain about the upstairs detector 
parker said the fire originated in a room off the foyer near the 
entrance of the building he said a folding bed was in the room 
but it was not being used at the time of the fire 
three families consisting of four adults and eight children 
lived in the house and had moved there last year officials said 
police capt mary dunlavy said carl wells who was treated at 
st frances medical center and released was the only survivor to 
have been interviewed 
he woke up went down the stairs and it was hot and he had to 
go of course back upstairs and try to wake the others she 
said and then he went out the window onto the roof and was 
rescued by the fire department with a ladder 
later tuesday police arrested joe pickens 34 and charged him 
with criminal trespass for living in the first floor of the 
building without permission parker said an apartment on the first 
floor was vacant 
hes somewhat of a homeless person the fire chief said 
he stayed there sometimes 
pickens was at the building monday night and left at 1130 
pm said parker pickens was being held at the peoria county jail 
parker said rescuers found people standing on the porch and 
some people on the roof there were people already injured when we 
got there 
as soon as we knocked the fire down it would come back up 
again this happened two or three times he said 
several neighbors said they watched helplessly as the fire swept 
the house 
the kid was up there waving her hands like she was yelling for 
help and the flames were all around her said charles harris 34 
who was visiting his sister in the apartment building next door 
three people died at the scene and six were pronounced dead at 
two hospitals said peoria county coroner herbert buzbee the 
children ranged in age from 2 months to 10 years he said 
as far as we know this is the worst fire weve ever had in 
peoria in terms of deaths the coroner said 
assistant fire chief sam sisk said he believed the cause of 
death was smoke inhalation 
joyce barnes 30 and eric davis 14 were in serious condition 
at franciscan medical center in rock island said spokeswoman neva 
aldene 
the coroner identified the dead as wanda hobbs 20 and her 
children ashly hobbs 1 and felicia hobbs 3 terry davis 27 
and her children carlyssa davis 2 arnisha davis 7 and tenora 
davis 10 
also pronounced dead were jacolby thomas the 2yearold

sue kocols first try at videotaping turned out 
to be onceinalifetime event 
peering through the viewfinder of a borrowed camera she 
recorded the dramatic crash of a helicopter that was removing 
equipment from the top of her 25story condominium building 
it was a peculiar thing mrs kocol said i do recall that 
as long as youre behind the camera you think maybe its not real 
maybe it the helicopter will straighten out 
but the craft that had begun to tilt and spin out of control 
first sent its load crashing to the ground and then plunged down 
itself 
it crashed next to the us coast guard station at the lake 
michigan shore but pilot ben moore the only person in the 
helicopter escaped serious injury 
moore 43 of elmhurst ill was treated for cuts to the legs 
and face at milwaukee county medical center said hospital 
spokeswoman pam hansen 
weve been very lucky here mrs kocol said at the moment 
it looked like it was going to be very tragic 
mrs kocols videotape and another taken from the roof by the 
buildings maintenance man peter bakke appeared on local and 
network newscasts tuesday evening 
richard l porter milwaukee district manager for the federal 
aviation administration attributed the crash to the failure of a 
coupling between a transmission drive shaft and the tail rotor as 
a result he said the rotor stopped and the helicopter started 
spinning clockwise out of control finally diving to the bank of 
ground next to an old submarine slip 
the helicopter was a sikorsky s58t owned by midwest helicopter 
airways inc of hinsdale ill 
mrs kocols son stan is a helicopter pilot with the air 
national guard in salina kan but mrs kocol said 
i really know nothing about flying and i really know nothing 
about cameras 
she had never used a video camera before but borrowed one from 
another son david monday night to videotape the helicopter at 
work 
she and her husband raymond watched from a small park as the 
helicopter arrived and began removing air conditioning equipment 
from the roof 
as the helicopter carried the largest piece believed to weigh 
about 2 tons the rotor snapped mrs kocol said on the 
videotapes soundtrack you hear kind of a grinding noise a 
little bit before he lets go of the piece she said 
fellow workers said the pilot signaled with his arm to those on 
the ground before letting go of the load 
everyone was stunned she said people were crying and 
very upset 
she said the scene was too much for her granddaughter christina 
kocol who witnessed the accident on her second birthday 
the accident left the girl very upset said mrs kocol and she 
took the child inside 
thats when she determined her camera work had captured the 
accident almost in its entirety

a lawyer for house speaker jim wright has been 
pleading wrights case before dozens of his democratic colleagues 
and even some lobbyists in sessions that critics say are flagrant 
violations of house secrecy rules 
the attorney william oldaker has been representing wright 
throughout the house ethics committees 10month investigation of 
the speakers financial dealings he was permitted to attend three 
weeks of closeddoor meetings beginning in late february at which 
the panels outside counsel richard phelan detailed the findings 
of his 1 million investigation 
following those sessions oldaker prepared a thick briefing book 
which he has used as the basis for meetings with house democrats 
and a selected handful of democratic lobbyists and political 
activists to present the speakers defense arguments 
the document is sprinkled throughout with allusions to phelans 
arguments and in some places includes direct quotes taken from 
secret depositions given before the committee for example it 
disputes phelans contention that wright marketed his book 
reflections of a public man but notes the speaker had made it 
clear to staff members that i would like for all the books to be 
sold that could be sold 
my reaction is sort of beyond rage into amazement said 
rep newt gingrich rga the speakers chief accuser and newly 
elected no 2 gop leadership official in the house 
gingrich said he was told at the time that the panel was taking 
the unusual step of allowing oldaker to sit in on its private 
deliberations because it was useful for members to hear the 
initial line of reasoning from the speakers attorney 
but he said the process is clearly confidential under house 
rules and for oldaker later to brief democrats including outside 
lobbyists on the case is an act so stupid so fundamentally 
undermining the ethics process that i find it hard to believe 
he is doing that gingrich said 
gingrich said two gop members of the ethics committee were 
stunned to hear of oldakers activities and promised to look 
into the matter the issue also came up at a republican leadership 
meeting tuesday which was attended by gop political operative ed 
rollins who has vowed to make wright and his ethics problems his 
top political target in the 1990 elections 
a spokesman for wright said tuesday that fewer than 100 
lawmakers had attended the oldaker briefings and maintained they 
were proper because they stick to facts and do not involve 
privileged information 
mr gingrich has spent an entire year trying to impugn the 
integrity of the speaker of the house the spokesman mark 
johnson said in a statement he distorts the facts of this case 
on a daily basis he is the one violating due process 
the inchthick briefing book prepared by oldaker contains 
numerous allusions to phelans arguments in the closeddoor 
meetings 
that wright actively marketed his book and conceded in secret 
testimony i am sure that all the members of the staff would have 
concluded rightfully that i would like for all the books to be sold 
that could be sold 
that 76 individuals or organizations bought bulk quantities of 
the book that testimony was received from 19 of them and that of 
those 11 had hosted speeches by wright that raised the question 
of whether wright was selling books in lieu of accepting speaking 
fees book income is not limited by the rules but speaking fees 
are 
that an investment company mallightco was a sham to 
funnel money from forth worth developer george a mallick to the 
wrights and that wrights wife betty did little work in return 
for her 18000ayear salary 
that because of mallicks oil and gas and real estate holdings 
he had a direct interest in legislation before congress 
meaning any benefits worth more than 100 received by wright as 
gifts from mallick would be improper 
committee chairman rep julian dixon dcalif declined to 
criticize oldaker saying only that he has to represent his 
client in the way he sees fit and that he did not know the 
content of the briefings 
but the panels senior republican rep john t myers of 
indiana said he had some concerns 
we extended the courtesy of our committee which is not 
required by the rules to oldaker myers said when he 
discusses what took place there hes in violation of house rules 
i guess im just giving a warning 
the two most serious remaining issues before the committee 
according to sources familiar with the inquiry are whether wright 
used bulk sales of his book to evade limits on outside income from 
speaking fees and whether mallick had an interest in legislation 
before congress when he paid benefits to the wrights 
the panel already has concluded that there is reason to believe 
those benefits mrs wrights salary use of a condominium and use 
of a cadillac amount to gifts that wright should have 
reported but did not according to sources

the promised land for heritage 
ministries lies not at the christian retreat formerly controlled by 
television evangelist jim bakker but for now across the border in 
north carolina its president said 
the ministry will relocate to charlotte nc but ultimately 
plans to settle in south carolina sam johnson announced tuesday at 
a news conference at the heritage usa television studios 
the ministry has made down payments on two tracts of land in 
north and south carolina totaling more than 100 acres and worth 
nearly 5 million johnson said 
heritage ministries is the nonprofit television ministry spun 
off from the bankruptcy reorganization of the ptl ministry in 
august 
the ministry and the separate heritage church of which johnson 
is pastor are based in fort mill at heritage usa the 2200acre 
retreat bakker once controlled 
amusement is a wonderful thing johnson said a family 
park is a wonderful thing mr bakker had a wonderful dream but it 
went awry through mismanagement and misappropriations and for that 
we have all paid and are paying dearly 
heritage ministries offered to purchase some of the properties 
it leases for 80000 a month from the former ptl corporation such 
as the television studio following bankruptcy proceedings 
but stephen mernick the toronto businessman who bought ptls 
assets for 65 million in december was unreceptive johnson said 
johnson said he informed mernick of the ministrys plans to move 
on monday 
the ministry will leave heritage usa by july 1 for a nearly 
20acre site of three lots in south charlotte johnson said 
a church on the site will serve as the home for the heritage 
church which has about 600 adult members and as the studio for 
the television ministry johnson said 
the ministry also has made a 10000 deposit on 88 acres of 
undeveloped land in south carolinas york county worth 25 million 
johnson said the ministry also has an option to purchase an 
additional 25 acres at the site 
the two sites are within miles of the ministrys current 
headquarters 
the ministrys more permanent home will be in york county 
where fort mill is located but it has not set a timetable for 
development of the site johnson said 
the most important concern for the ministry johnson said is 
raising the money to finance the resettlement 
one likely source is 55 million donated by heritage ministries 
supporters when the ministry was considering bidding on ptl before 
mernicks purchase the ministry plans a campaign this weekend to 
reach those contributors 
we believe that most of the money if not all of it will 
be released to help us relocate and cross the river jordan and 
enter the promised land johnson said 
more contributions could come in from supporters who have waited 
for the ministry to announce its plans johnson said 
ptl filed for bankruptcy in june 1987 three months after bakker 
resigned amid revelations that he had a sexual relationship with 
church secretary jessica hahn and later arranged payments of 
ministry money to buy her silence 
mernick began joint operation of heritage usa which includes a 
hotel and theme park with bankruptcy trustee mc red benton 
on feb 13 but has yet to close on the sale

pakistan has agreed to allow four un 
checkpoints on its border with afghanistan following an exchange of 
charges and denials at an emergency meeting of the un security 
council 
afghanistans marxist government and its ally the soviet union 
claim pakistan is violating international accords by aiding afghan 
guerrillas 
pakistan has denied the allegations but announced tuesday at the 
united nations that it would allow un checkpoints in chaman 
parachinar torkham and nawa pass 
most un diplomats said the few checkpoints would not stem the 
tide of infiltration across the border 
the united nations has just 50 military observers in afghanistan 
and pakistan and pakistans government had allowed them to roam the 
border at will but not set up checkpoints 
afghan foreign minister abdul wakil called for un checkpoints 
amd urged the security council to send a mission to the region to 
investigate his claim that pakistan is committing aggression 
against afghanistan 
he accused pakistan of waging fullfledged war and called 
for an international conference to safeguard afghanistans 
sovereignty he said the united states and the soviet union as 
coguarantors of a unmediated afghan accord should persuade 
pakistan to halt its support of the afghan insurgents 
iqbal akhund a pakistani foreign affairs official called the 
afghan charges a fabrication but he told the security council that 
pakistan has agreed to provide a permanent presence along the 
border to the un military assistance group for afghanistan and 
pakistan 
then he added peace and stability in afghanistan can be 
restored only if power is transferred from the illegal kabul regime 
to a broadbased government acceptable to the afghan people 
the soviet union sent troops into afghanistan in december 1979 
to help the government battle the guerrillas and eventually had 
more than 100000 military personnel in the country under the 
unsponsored accord the soviets accepted a withdrawal plan and 
said the last of its troops had pulled out as of feb 15 millions 
of afghan refugees fled into pakistan over the past decade and the 
major afghan rebel groups established their bases along the 
frontier 
the security council meeting in response to afghanistans 
complaint heard only afghan and pakistani speakers the meeting 
was adjourned and another session was to be scheduled after 
consultations among the 15 council members 
no resolution is expected because the united states is an ally 
of pakistan and helps support the rebels washington could be 
expected to veto any measure critical of pakistan 
wakil accused pakistan of numerous attacks and of involving its 
forces in fighting in afghanistan including the battle for the 
city of jalalabad near the pakistani border 
he also claimed pakistan is arming and training afghan rebels 
and has established 125 training centers on afghan soil in 
violation of the un accords 
afghanistan and pakistan signed the pact in april 1988 it 
provides for the withdrawal of the soviet forces and 
noninterference in the other countrys internal affairs 
the soviet union and united states signed as guarantors but 
both have continued supplying their respective sides 
wakil did not directly criticize the united states but said 
the question is why the united states a big world power 
becomes the tool for the implementation of pakistani policies on 
afghanistan and why should the strategic interests of the united 
states be subordinated to the expansionist designs of pakistan in 
the region

the government says its troops 
repelled a guerrilla assault on jalalabad killing hundreds of 
attackers and denies that insurgents have cut off land shipments 
to the embattled eastern city 
but guerrillas and western diplomats in kabul and pakistan said 
the insurgents controlled major portions of the road connecting 
jalalabad and kabul and that only helicopters flying by night can 
make the 75mile trip 
the regimes army is trying desperately to open the 
kabuljalalabad highway the guerrillas afghan news agency said 
tuesday 
also tuesday pakistan agreed to allow the united nations to set 
up permanent monitoring posts along its border with afghanistan as 
requested by moscow and the marxist government in kabul 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said government 
troops on tuesday counterattacked 14000 usbacked guerrillas 
around jalalabad after the insurgents bombarded the city with 
18000 shells and rockets sunday and monday 
amani said troops had killed 318 guerrillas by sundown tuesday 
and lost just three government soldiers and five civilians it was 
not possible to confirm the figures 
the capture of jalalabad 45 miles west of the border with 
pakistan where the guerrillas are based would give the insurgents 
an important foothold and provide their shadow governmentinexile 
with its first seat inside afghanistan 
amani maintained that military convoys were still carrying food 
and arms from kabul to jalalabad he said the convoys were not seen 
leaving the capital because they travel at night civilians are not 
permitted out of their houses during a curfew starting 11 pm and 
ending 4 am 
western diplomats in the pakistani capital of islamabad said 
afghan government forces were holding the city and its airport but 
guerrilla rockets and artillery make it too dangerous for 
fixedwing aircraft 
the only means of resupply remaining to regime forces is by 
helicopter although such flights are increasingly being 
interdicted by the resistance even though most of them take place 
at night said one diplomat on condition of anonymity 
indeed most of the flights are kept busy bringing in medical 
supplies and evacuating casualties the diplomat said 
at the united nations on tuesday pakistan agreed to permit un 
military observers to set up permanent checkpoints along the 
afghanpakistan border 
kabul contends aid from pakistan is flowing to the afghan rebels 
in violation of a unmediated accord on noninterference 
pakistan denies the charges but its agreement on the additional 
checkpoints is considered a minor concession diplomats said they 
doubted it would alter the afghan civil war 
the increased presence of un military observers who now 
number just 50 and are split between kabul and islamabad has 
repeatedly been requested by afghanistan and the soviet union 
pakistan the united states china and several moslem countries 
are the main backers of the guerrillas who began fighting after a 
communist coup in 1978 soviet military forces entered the war in 
1979 and completed a unnegotiated withdrawal feb 15

the government has indicted northrop corp 
for allegedly falsifying test data on cruise missile guidance 
systems raising questions whether the strategic nuclear weapon 
would function in time of war 
the aerospace giant and five current or former employees were 
charged tuesday with conspiring to defraud the government in the 
construction of part of the air force missiles guidance system and 
a component of the navys harrier fighter jet 
the 167count indictment charged that northrop and the employees 
conspired to install parts for the flight data transmitter of the 
cruise missile that failed to meet government specifications 
in addition to the suspect guidance systems the defendants were 
accused of falsifying test data on the stability system for the 
harrier 
the us district court indictment said the cruise missile data 
transmitter was required to undergo tests for effectiveness in 
extreme cold but were not performed the indictment said defendants 
falsely certified untested units 
in some cases faulty components were certified as having passed 
tests according to the indictment 
northrop said it strongly disputes any allegations of criminal 
behavior in the indictments that were announced tuesday night by 
us attorney robert bonner 
northrop has cooperated fully with the government during its 
investigation the century citybased company added in its 
statement 
bonner said the air force and navy are evaluating evidence on 
the falsifications to determine if action must be taken to ensure 
reliability of the airlaunched missiles alcms which are mounted 
from the wings of b1b and b52 bombers and the stability system 
for the harrier jet 
but john pike an aerospace analyst with the washington 
dcbased federation of american scientists said most bombers 
must fly over the polar ice cap 
the alcms are going to get very cold it would raise the 
possibility that a significant number would not work if they were 
called on to work 
between 1981 and 1989 northrop produced and shipped about 1175 
flight data transmitters for use in the missiles 
pike said if the effectiveness of the missiles were called into 
question it would be one of the more significant weapons 
reliability problems in several decades 
bonner said the indictment was the result of a twoyear 
investigation by a task force that included the air forces office 
of special investigations the naval investigative service and the 
fbi 
if convicted of all offenses northrop faces a maximum fine of 
more than 30 million each defendant would face maximum prison 
sentences of five years on each count and fines ranging from 5000 
to 250000 
individuals indicted were joseph yamron vice president and 
general manager of the precision products division of northrop in 
newton mass leopold engler of massachusetts formerly a vice 
president with northrop charles gonsalves of glendora calif 
former manager of the western services department of northrop in 
suburban el monte cheryl hannan of glendora formerly quality 
assurance supervisor for western services and howard hyde of yorba 
linda former chief engineer for western services 
on the cruise missile project the indictment charges that 
northrop yamron and engler knew that the flight data transmitter 
was required to withstand temperatures as low as minus 65 degrees 
fahrenheit but supplied parts that froze at temperatures of minus 
40 to minus 50 degrees 
the harrier is a hightechnology jet fighter that can take off 
vertically and hover between 1982 and 1989 northrop produced and 
shipped 189 rate sensor assemblies for the jet 
northrop also is the target of five civil lawsuits by former 
employees who alleged the company falsified test results and 
cheated the air force on the mx missile project 
in addition to wellpublicized battles with critics of the mx 
program the company faces a congressional investigation of 
allegations of improper payments to south korean businessmen in an 
unsuccessful effort to sell its f20 tigershark fighter in that 
country in 1984 
northrop also is the main contractor for the b2 stealth 
bomber

mexico has signed a 365 billion threeyear 
loan agreement with the international monetary fund to bolster the 
countrys foreign exchange reserves and help spur domestic economic 
growth 
the accord breaks from previous imf practice by mandating no new 
austerity measures said treasury secretary pedro aspe 
mexico struggling to overcome the burden of payments to 
commercial banks and governments on its 107 billion foreign debt 
is the developing worlds secondlargest debtor only brazil owes 
more 121 billion 
tuesdays agreement is the first from the international lending 
community since us treasury secretary nicholas brady outlined a 
debtreduction plan on march 10 that he hoped would help ease 
payment terms on the developing worlds 132 trillion foreign debt 
as interest rates have risen worldwide since last year the 
higher rates have created additional problems for countries 
struggling to meet the terms of payments to foreign creditors some 
debtor nations threaten default unless they can arrive at more 
favorable terms with lenders 
austerity measures imposed by the venezuelan government at the 
behest of international lending organizations prompted riots last 
month in caracas that led to the deaths of more than 300 people 
aspe said tuesday that his countrys agreement intends to 
reverse mexicos net outflow of funds and provide investment money 
to spur economic growth which was nil last year 
by stipulating that the imf recognizes mexicos need to set its 
growth priorities first and schedule debt servicing accordingly 
aspe said the agreement is a fundamental change from the past 
the agreement reached with the imf constitutes a plain 
endorsement of the economic strategy of mexico he said 
that means the imf will not require further devaluations of the 
mexican peso as has been called for in previous agreements in an 
effort to stimulate exports said one government official on 
condition of anonymity 
president carlos salinas de gortarihas pressed efforts to cut 
the outflow of capital needed to revitalize mexicos stagnant 
economy 
mexico has been expected to be among the first beneficiaries of 
the us plan which seeks to entice banks to forgive part of the 
debt in return for assurances from the imf and world bank that the 
remaining debt will be paid 
aspe also announced that mexico will conclude an agreement this 
week with the world bank for 15 billion in credits to support the 
governments restructuring programs 
in addition mexico shortly expects to obtain 500 million in 
compensatory financing from the fund aspe said the combined 
credits will be devoted to operations that reduce the debt and 
its servicing he said 
on april 19 mexico will formally present creditor banks its 
proposals to reduce the foreign debts value cut servicing and 
obtain additional lending over several years the treasury chief 
said 
mexico will offer banks the option of exchanging old debt for 
mexican bonds that discount debt principal and reduce interest 
rates aspe told the private 24 hours newscast late tuesday 
mexico netted a 11 billion reduction of debt principal in a 
bond auction backed by the us treasury last year 
aspe said the imf agreement also will promote mexicos efforts 
to reach restructuring agreements with the paris club of creditor 
government banks 
he stressed that tuesdays pact is a new type of agreement 
that bolsters a strategy of sustained economic growth with price 
stability a clear reference to salinas antiinflation program 
that program has reduced inflation from a record 1592 percent 
in 1987 to 527 percent in 1988 the government predicts inflation 
will reach 18 percent this year

many voters are angry that gov gaston 
caperton broke his notax campaign pledge but caperton defends the 
record tax hike and says he couldnt be more satisfied with his 
first three months in office 
we inherited a state which was in real crisis the 
democratic governor said tuesday i think we welldefined that 
crisis and with a cooperative effort with the legislature have 
set forth a legislative program to turn this state around and we 
batted about 1000 percent 
the 392 million tax package is just one of the accomplishments 
caperton pointed to with pride after the regular legislative 
session ended last week 
lawmakers on both sides of the aisle passed virtually all his 
major bills including one calling for a sweeping reorganization of 
state government and generally gave him rave reviews for his 
leadership it was a dramatic change from the previous four years 
in which a legislature dominated by democrats fought almost 
constantly with combative republican gov arch moore who lost to 
caperton in november 
hes been honest said republican state sen buffy warner 
hes been very actively and personally involved and i think both 
on the surface and the deeper you look the man is trying his 
absolute best to do what has to be done in this state 
caperton inherited a treasury that was millions of dollars in 
debt because of severe slumps in the coal and steel industries in 
recent years which drove up unemployment and cuts in federal 
assistance 
despite his campaign pledge caperton asked the legislature for 
the largest tax increase in its history including a new 6 percent 
sales tax on food and a 5centagallon gasoline tax 
i also said id never be a governor who couldnt pay his 
bills caperton said we had the courage and the guts to stand 
up and raise taxes no one likes to raise taxes and no one 
likes to pay additional taxes but it was necessary 
many voters apparently didnt appreciate that courage some tax 
protesters who showed up at the capitol last month carried signs 
calling for capertons impeachment 
a statewide poll conducted in midmarch showed 73 percent of 
respondents thought caperton broke his campaign promise by pushing 
for a tax hike within a week of taking office and twothirds rated 
his job performance as just fair or poor 
the poll showed caperton would trail moore by 43 percent to 36 
percent if an election were held today 
lawmakers approved capertons plan to consolidate more than 155 
state agencies and departments under seven gubernatorially 
appointed cabinetlevel secretaries 
they also approved capertons request to put proposed 
constitutional amendments before voters in september one amendment 
would abolish the elected posts of secretary of state treasurer 
and agriculture commissioner and put the jobs under the governors 
control another would place the board of education under the 
governors control 
agriculture commissioner cleve benedict the only republican 
holding statewide office said caperton was making a grab for power 
its the honeymoon express he said every governor enjoys 
a period of good will with the legislature this time it is 
amplified by the governors partys overwhelming control of both 
chambers of the legislature 
caperton says he isnt concerned about the polls or the 
protests and warner one of only four republicans in the 34seat 
senate says theres plenty of time for anger to ease before 
capertons term ends in 1992 
four years will be enough time to see that hes done the 
things that needed to be done he said

the dontdrinkanddrive message went hollywood 
this season with tv stars making references to designated 
drivers and occasionally wresting car keys away from inebriated 
characters 
the additions were part of a carefully scripted effort to 
introduce the notion that drinking and driving is socially 
unacceptable from the powerful podium of primetime television 
said jay winsten of the harvard alcohol project 
one of our goals was to increase public awareness just of the 
concept of designated driver to introduce it into the american 
lexicon said winsten assistant dean of harvards school of 
public health and director of its center for health communication 
scenes varied from devious jr ewing of dallas sleeping off 
a night on the town before heading for southfork to family ties 
character alex keaton volunteering to drive friends home from an 
evening jaunt 
the message has been written into 32 television programs since 
the season began last fall including an entire episode of abcs 
highly rated growing pains to be broadcast tonight winsten 
said 
you dont change social norms overnight but were off to a 
good start he said 
the harvard alcohol project begun in late 1987 is trying to 
harness the influence of hollywood and madison avenue in making 
drinking and driving as socially passe as smoking cigarettes 
last year harvard researchers made a lowkey appeal to 
television executives to write in occasional references to 
designated drivers the proposal was endorsed by the board of the 
writers guild of americawest 
having characters casually refer to picking a designated driver 
someone who stays sober to drive the drinkers home reinforces what 
is already becoming accepted partying behavior winsten said 
our role really is as a catalyst he said producers like 
the public theyre primed and ready to respond to this issue 
the message was broadcast in various ways this season 
on one episode of cbs dallas a bedraggled jr ewing 
explains to his young son that he couldnt drive home the night 
before because hed been drinking of course jr isnt telling 
the whole truth about his nocturnal adventures but the message is 
clear 
on nbcs family ties alex keaton the character played by 
michael j fox visits a restaurant with a tank of live fish when 
a member of the group is soaked in a mishap in the tank fox is 
asked to take her home he responds by saying he is the designated 
driver but had expected to drive home someone who drank like a 
fish not someone who was hit by a fish 
the growing pains episode revolves around carol seaver 
tracey gold and her boyfriend sandy who is seriously injured in 
an auto accident after drinking at a college hangout 
what we hope to achieve is i guess just an increased 
awareness of the dangers involved and try to puncture the myth of 
invulnerability that most teenagers have said steve marshall a 
growing pains producer 
many campaigns have focused on discouraging drunken driving a 
leading cause of death among young adults but the harvard project 
originates from a public school of health that traditionally 
focuses on training epidemiologists and other health professionals

seven children and two women who died in a 
house fire apparently had little warning because a firstfloor 
smoke detector in an empty apartment didnt work authorities said 
the victims were sleeping on the second floor said gregory 
joos peorias fire administration manager 
by the time they were aware their home was on fire he said 
the fire had gotten a very good start and their means of getting 
out of the structure had already been cut off due to the heat and 
smoke 
fire swept through the rented twostory dwelling about 2 am 
tuesday killing nine people and injuring two adults and one child 
three families lived in the house in a workingclass section of 
peoria population 130000 
i came home and i saw the lights and awakened my husband 
said neighbor maria diaz we came running out and by the time we 
came out the house was already engulfed in flames 
later tuesday police arrested joe pickens 34 and charged him 
with criminal trespass for living in the first floor of the 
building without permission said fire chief g john parker 
pickens was at the building monday night and left at 1130 
pm parker said pickens who was not charged in the fire was 
apparently homeless and sometimes stayed at the house the fire 
chief said 
pickens was being held at the peoria county jail 
smoke detectors were found in the building but the firstfloor 
detector was powered by electricity which had been cut on the 
first floor april 4 because bills went unpaid said central 
illinois light co spokesman tom flanagan 
electricity worked on the buildings second floor flanagan 
said officials were unsure whether the secondfloor detector had 
sounded 
joos said local and state codes require smoke detectors in 
apartments and homes 
landlord and tenant both share the responsibility of making 
sure that not only the smoke detector exists but making sure that 
they work and are functioning correctly he said 
the fire started on the first floor near the door and 
investigators were examining a gas heater said parker at this 
point we still dont have any indication that this is a suspicious 
or an arson fire he said 
parker said as many as 15 firefighters will undergo 
psychological counseling to help them cope with stress linked to 
the deaths 
were going to try to talk to all the guys and see if theres 
any problem he said if we find out theyre suffering we 
wont have them back yet 
the cause of the deaths appeared to be smoke inhalation said 
assistant fire chief sam sisk the children ranged in age from 2 
months to 10 years 
at franciscan medical center in rock island joyce barnes 30 
and eric davis 14 were in fair condition today said nursing

the citys first black school chief hung on to his 
job by one vote but opponents of laval s wilson vowed to continue 
working to oust him 
bitterness from the 76 vote tuesday night by the boston school 
committee spilled over to the announcement that wilsons contract 
would be renewed 
as committee president tom oreilly tried to move on to other 
agenda items after the announcement committee member robert 
cappucci suddenly took command of the microphone 
were going to do everything in our power to see to it that we 
get a new superintendent cappucci said 
wilson said he was delighted with the renewal but acknowledged 
there had been problems during his tenure 
i dont think anyone was expecting a real endorsement the 
53yearold chicago native said after the announcement the issue 
was whether or not we could continue the progress weve made 
wilsons arrival in boston four years ago to operate the 
countrys oldest public school system was heralded as the healing 
of racial wounds that had festered since the first days of 
federally ordered desegregation in the mid1970s 
but the honeymoon has come to an end in recent months with 
critics increasingly denouncing what they call wilsons 
autocratic style 
committee member john nucci who supports wilson said it was 
everyones duty to try to make the uneasy union work 
i hope they realize that personal vendetta have to be put 
aside in the interest of the school system he said we have to 
think of the kids first 
but cappucci said he and other dissenters would show their 
displeasure by voting down wilsons program proposals and making an 
intense effort to lobby the swing vote necessary to oust the 
superintendent 
theres going to be some troublemaking said peggy 
davismullen a committee member and one of wilsons fiercest 
detractors 
the committee which announced its decision after deliberating 
about two hours behind closed doors offered wilson a contract 
without an increase to his 95000 salary and with performance 
reviews every six months 
its not a working situation cappucci said i dont see 
how dr wilson thinks hell be able to get anything done 
if i were him id see the handwriting on the wall and bow 
out he said he is not the man for the boston job 
mrs mullen said some people who oppose wilson are afraid 
theyre going to be attacked for being racist but black leaders 
have come out against this man its his approach hes not a 
communicator not a motivator 
the system has become increasingly black since the early 1970s 
when white students began moving in droves from public to private 
schools there are 59000 students 24 percent of them white 
enrolled in bostons public schools today as compared with 96000 
in 1972 when 60 percent of students were white 
supporters have said wilson is a tireless worker who regularly 
puts in 12hour days and deserves a fair shot at turning the 
troubled system around but detractors claim he hasnt dealt 
effectively with high dropout rates and low test scores

mayor tom bradley fended off an upstart 
challenger to win an unprecedented fifth term in a squeaker 
election that almost had him facing a runoff 
never take anything for granted the 71yearold bradley 
told supporters today after his narrow victory 
bradley the citys first black mayor an excop and son of a 
sharecropper needed at least 50 percent of the vote to avoid a 
june 6 runoff 
early today he held more than 52 percent of the vote with 984 
percent of the citys precincts reporting at one point he had 
dropped to 50 percent of tuesdays nonpartisan vote in which 
turnout was less than 20 percent 
bradleys nearest finisher among the 10 candidates freshman 
councilman nate holden conceded after midnight 
a little more time and more money there could have been a 
difference said holden who gathered only 150000 for his 
campaign funds versus bradleys 2 million 
bradley who remained out of sight most of tuesday night 
declared victory early today 
i am grateful for the people who gave us this victory he 
told supporters at the biltmore hotel 
bradley quickly pledged to renew the battle against drugs and 
gangs that plague the nations second largest city 
with 984 percent of the 2353 precincts reporting bradley had 
152373 of the vote or 5213 percent holden had 81747 votes or 
28 percent and former county supervisor and television commentator 
baxter ward drew 44186 votes or 15 percent 
only 165 percent or 384000 of the citys 19 million 
registered voters went to the polls to elect the officials to lead 
los angeles during the next four years 
a poll taken recently by the los angeles times showed 78 percent 
of hispanics 70 percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a 
favorable impression of the democratic mayor 
thats led bradley to be dubbed the teflon mayor because 
hes apparently not being blamed for the citys mounting urban 
problems 
other candidates included a socialist oil field worker and a 
singerdancer who used to cavort in a green bikini across the 
street from city hall every day 
the victory by bradley who has been mayor 16 years puts him in 
a position to oversee los angeles into the early 1990s as the 
population swells past 3 million people with more than 70 
different languages spoken 
bradley had been expected to win another fouryear term despite 
a city attorneys office announcement of an ethics investigation of 
him after learning he had performed consulting work with far east 
national bank which did business with the city bradley has 
returned the 18000 in fees he was paid by the bank and called the 
charges politically motivated at election time 
pollsters and wouldbe opponents such as city councilman zev 
yaroslavsky agreed that bradleys lowkey image kept him from being 
linked in voters minds with los angeles growing problems 
including criminal gangs illegal drug trade traffic congestion 
and a failing sewage system 
bradley the son of a texas sharecropper and the grandson of 
slaves was first elected mayor in 1973

handguns are now banned in this affluent 
chicago suburb where the quiet was shattered 11 months ago when a 
deranged woman went on a shooting rampage in an elementary school 
after only minutes of debate village council voted 60 tuesday 
night to adopt an ordinance banning the private ownership of 
handguns 
i hope this will make winnetka a better place and we will 
leave a better heritage for all of you village president clarine 
hall told a group of young children who gave flowers to council 
members after the vote 
the children their parents and others pushed for passage of the 
ban 
on may 20 1988 laurie dann walked into a winnetka elementary 
school classroom killed an 8yearold boy and wounded several 
other children she later wounded a young man at his home then 
killed herself 
she carried three handguns she bought in neighboring glenview 
it is almost a year and i am satisfied that this has had 
thoughtful consideration said ms hall referring to the ban 
oliver ralli 9 a fourthgrader said he was mad that laurie 
dann wounded kids and killed one in school i just wanted to ban 
handguns 
board member sandra levin said she would rather see state and 
national laws banning handguns but i dont foresee this in the 
near future 
thats why we have to start on the local level ms levin 
said 
the vote came a week after winnetka residents in a nonbinding 
referendum voted 2125 to 1407 in favor of banning handguns in 
the town north of chicago on lake michigan schoolchildren made 
posters and signs urging people to vote for the ban 
the new ordinance bans the sale and possession of handguns it 
excludes police officers gun collectors and security guards 
violators face a fine of 300 to 500 for a first offense 
the measure which takes effect immediately calls for the 
voluntary surrender of nonexempt guns to the police department 
within three months 
winnetka has few crimes last year the village of 13000 had no 
reported robberies or rapes police havent fired a gun for at 
least a year and before the dann incident the last homicide was 
in 1957 
james zangrilli a resident of oak park and a national board 
member of the national rifle association said that such a ban was 
unconstitutional and would turn ordinary citizens into lawbreakers 
five other chicago suburbs have handgun bans including morton 
grove which in 1981 became the first us community to prohibit 
the weapons evanston and oak park followed suit while ms danns 
shooting rampage provided the impetus for two northern suburbs 
wilmette and highland park to prohibit handguns 
state lawmakers recently introduced legislation that calls for a 
mandatory waiting period before all handgun sales

president augusto pinochet the army 
commander and leader of chile since 1973 says the military will 
intervene again if order is not maintained by the next 
government 
chiles military is preparing to surrender power after 16 years 
of authoritarian rule 
in october voters rejected a military proposal to extend 
pinochets term until 1997 an open presidential election now is 
scheduled for dec 14 with the winner to take office on march 11 
the 73yearold pinochet speaking monday night in southern 
chile said the armed forces must guard the constitutional 
order 
that obliges us to make sure without hesitation that the 
sons of this land will not see the efforts of these years 
destroyed he said we will continue to work to ensure that 
those seeking political power are authentic democrats who defend 
the model of a free society 
army gen alejandro medina commander of the military academy 
delivered a stronger message monday to hundreds of noncommissioned 
officers 
if the institutional order is broken the armed forces have 
the duty to restore it using all the necessary means he 
said 
medina said civilians must understand the role of the armed 
forces and that role is not one of a policeman watching the 
country but to support the reign of law and the institutional 
order 
opposition leaders have denounced what the military calls the 
institutional order which is based on a 1980 constitution approved 
in a referendum 
opponents have centered their criticism on two issues a 
constitutional article that allows pinochet and the heads of the 
other military branches to remain as commanders until 1998 and the 
creation of a militarydominated national security council to 
represent its views on crucial matters 
no significant progress has been reported in negotiations 
between the government and opposition on possible constitutional 
changes 
pinochet authorized the negotiations but said he would not allow 
changes in key articles

wild bill hickok was shot in the head 
during a poker game in deadwood more than a century ago but the 
citys voters have bet that restoring gambling will give a shot in 
the arm to the goldrush towns economy 
residents voted 690230 tuesday to allow poker blackjack and 
slot machines with the citys cut of the proceeds to be used to 
restore and preserve buildings in the historic black hills 
community of 2000 
an amendment to the south dakota constitution last year provided 
that gambling limited to 5 bets would be permitted in deadwood if 
60 percent of the citys voters approved it 
south dakota is the third state to allow casino gambling 
joining new jersey and nevada 
melodee nelson head of the deadwood you bet committee said 
legalized gambling should boost the economy increase tourism 
create jobs and help hold down property taxes 
but lets all remember its first and foremost a funding 
mechanism for historic preservation she said thats what it 
started out as thats what its always been 
supporters hope the games can begin this summer said bill 
walsh owner of the 85yearold franklin hotel he said the 
restoration of gambling is about as important as the arrival of the 
first train in 1890 
its here and we want to all jump on the train and ride this 
thing for the betterment of the city of deadwood and the state of 
south dakota he said 
about 50 supporters of the measure gathered tuesday night in the 
hotel lobby which is guarded by a bust of hickok 
but their celebration was subdued by the outcome of the mayoral 
election mayor tom blair a gambling supporter ran into trouble 
in his reelection bid blair finished second in a threeway race 
and now will face firstplace finisher bruce oberlander in a runoff 
in two weeks 
some residents quietly opposed a return to gambling on moral 
grounds and argued that the games wouldnt provide that much of an 
economic boost 
i dont know that im as disappointed as much as im hurt by 
this when people arent looking at moral issues here said the 
rev don hadrick of the united methodist church in deadwood 
supporters think gambling will help make the area a final 
destination for tourists instead of just a stop on the way to 
yellowstone national park the rocky mountains or mount rushmore 
national monument which is about 50 miles away 
they have predicted gambling could attract at least 200000 
additional tourists a year it also could provide 500000 annually 
to further promote tourism by restoring an old west look to the 
city founded when miners flooded the area afer the 1876 discovery 
of gold in deadwood gulch 
before gambling begins a south dakota gaming commission will be 
appointed to write regulations 
deadwood owes much of its tourism reputation to hickok the us 
marshal and frontiersman who was shot in the back of the head in 
1876 during a poker game in a saloon called no 10 legend has it 
he was holding a pair each of aces and eights known since as the 
dead mans hand 
gambling has been illegal in south dakota for about 100 years 
but illegal games flourished openly in deadwood saloons as recently 
as the 1930s and 40s 
a law passed by the legislature this year gave the state 40 
percent of any gambling taxes and other revenues with lawrence 
county to get a 10 percent cut the city of deadwood was left with 
all the tax and fee revenue remaining after the expenses of 
regulating the games are paid

residents of this border city said 
today they hope they can ward off a stigma that could be attached 
to their community after the cult mutilations of at least 12 people 
it is not fair if people in the united states try to judge all 
of us just because a few people committed these atrocities 
ignacio garcia a supervisor at pancho villas restaurant said 
this morning those people may not even be from matamoros 
we dont really know what the reaction of the american people 
will be but we are very concerned and we will tell the tourists 
that 999 percent of the people here are good and that it only 
takes one or two to give the others the bad name 
five men have been arrested in connection with the slayings 
mexican authorities said authorities on tuesday announced the 
arrests after discovering several graves at the santa elena ranch 
outside of matamoros 
the graves contained remains of 12 bodies including that of 
mark kilroy a 21yearold university of texas premedical student 
who disappeared from the streets of matamoros during spring break 
on march 14 
authorities said the victims most of them still unidentified 
were sacrificed in a voodoo ritual intended to ward off harm to the 
suspects during drugsmuggling activities 
the streets of matamoros were quiet early this morning a day 
after the revelations hit the newspapers and television airwaves 
resident beatrice cistkovit said many residents worried about 
kilroy after his parents james and helen kilroy offered a 15000 
reward seeking information about his disappearance 
we put ourselves in the parents position we really felt for 
them she said they should give those guys the death penalty 
because its horrible what they did they should hang they dont 
deserve to live 
however she worried that publicity about the case could cast a 
dark shadow on the city 
with a month before summer vacationers begin their annual summer 
descent on matamoros some residents said the revelations will not 
greatly affect tourism 
this town is a tranquil place there are some fights every 
once in a while and there are some faith healers here too but 
nothing like this has ever happened and its new to us said 
manuel sandoval a restaurant manager this may take a little 
time to pass but we think it wont hurt us too much

for mayor tom bradley called the teflon 
mayor because the blame for the citys problems hasnt stuck to 
him in the past the timing for a reelection bid couldnt have 
been much worse 
gangrelated murders are on the rise traffic congestion is 
horrendous the sewage system is failing and theres problems with 
smog housing and homelessness 
the 71yearold bradley los angeles first black mayor won 
election to an unprecedented fifth term tuesday but by a far less 
of a margin than published polls had predicted 
early today he held more than 52 percent of the vote with 984 
percent of the citys precincts reporting he needed at least 50 
percent to avoid a june 6 runoff his nine rivals were not well 
known and voter turnout was less than 20 percent 
a recent poll by the los angeles times showed 78 percent of 
hispanics 70 percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a 
favorable impression of the democratic mayor 
pollsters had said that bradleys lowkey image helped him 
bradley mayor for 16 years a city councilman and a policeman 
before that may be one of the most private public persons in 
america 
theres a mystery about him that i dont know if anyone will 
ever crack former press deputy tom sullivan once saidive 
spent more time with him than anyone including his wife during 
the campaigns i still dont understand him 
his political powers as mayor include an ability to heal his 
wounds almost overnight and a quick recovery when he slips 
hes slipped twice in runs for governor in his first try he 
lost to george deukmejian in 1982 by just 12 percent 
some said voter racism shaved the ballots bradley needed to win 
but he refused to blame prejudice for losing the campaign except 
in oblique references years later 
with a monotonal speech delivery and a decided dislike for 
public feuding bradley is a far cry from such contemporaries as 
new yorks edward koch 
but at 6foot4 and still bearing an athletic trim in his eighth 
decade bradley can afford to dispense with histrionics and 
armwaving to get things done 
his political power observers say lies in his attention to 
detail he takes notes on potholes while riding through the city 
and his refusal to delegate authoity to staffers their role is to 
do his bidding and do it quickly 
wanda moore bradleys executive assistant has said bradley 
sees 999 percent of the paperwork that passes through his office 
down to gripe letters from constituents 
his 1987 appointment calendar opened to the los angeles times 
shows him in unrelenting motion working 16 to 18 hours a day 
seven days a week 
he went to 512 social engagements that year including birthday 
parties bar mitzvahs weddings pancake breakfasts and the opening 
of a fastfood chicken restaurant 
those appearances are another key for bradley his ability in a 
city of more than 3 million to appear to be everywhere at once he 
doesnt even have to be in some spots to have his presence felt 
busts of bradley stare at visitors at the los angeles 
international airports tom bradley terminal the los angeles 
convention center and the los angeles produce mart all tributes to 
the revitalization and building of the city for which bradley has 
taken credit without the usual hoopla 
he also brought the profitable 1984 summer olympics to the city 
and has encouraged los angeles role as an important center of 
pacific rim trading

a us military team arrived in vietnam 
today for the fifth joint field investigation to account for 
american servicemen missing from the vietnam war a us spokesman 
said 
the 10 specialists flew from bangkok to vietnams capital of 
hanoi for the 18day mission which is expected to be the longest 
of its type since the war ended said ross petzing the spokesman 
of the us embassy in bangkok 
previous investigations were limited to about 10 days each 
the us investigators including forensic scientists are from 
the us joint casualty resolution center and the army central 
identification laboratory both based in honolulu they will work 
with officials of vietnams office for seeking missing personnel 
us defense department officials said earlier that most of the 
investigative work this month would focus on the area of danang a 
major port 400 miles southeast of hanoi 
danang is in what was south vietnam which the united states 
supported in the war the against communist north the marines who 
splashed ashore there in march 1965 were the first american combat 
troops to set foot on the asian mainland since the end of the 
korean conflict 
us forces withdrew in 1973 and south vietnam fell to communist 
forces in april 1975 
in the joint field missions american and vietnamese 
investigators interview villagers and inspect us warplane crash 
sites to try to resolve discrepancy cases that the us 
considers top priority 
these are cases that us officials say vietnamese authorities 
should have information on including cases of airmen who survived 
crashes but failed to emerge from prisoner of war camps 
the us defense department previously announced that vietnam on 
april 27 would return 21 sets of remains that may be those of 
missing americans 
vietnam has returned large numbers of remains since august 1987 
when it agreed to accelerate cooperation on the issue in return for 
washingtons help in encouraging private humanitarian aid to 
vietnam 
more than 1700 americans are listed as missing in action in 
vietnam and others are unaccounted for in laos cambodia and china 
the provietnamese government in cambodia claims to have found 
the remains of some of the 83 us servicemen missing there but a 
senior cambodian official last week there was no progress in 
arranging their repatriation 
uch kiman director of the foreign ministrys political 
department repeated his governments demand that the us 
government receive the remains directly and not through 
intermediaries 
washington has refused to do that and instead has requested 
assistance from an international organization because it does not 
recognize the government which vietnam installed after invading 
the country in late 1978 
there should be negotiations between governments not between 
this government and private groups uch kiman said in an 
interview in phnom penh with two western journalists 
we dont seem to have a positive signal from the american 
government regarding the return of the remains of the mias 
he said 
in february cambodias prime minister hun sen told a former 
american aid official that about 10 percent of the 83 americans 
listed as mia have been found

more sailors might have survived the sinking of a 
soviet submarine off norway if they had realized sooner that the 
vessel could not be saved the soviet northern fleet commander said 
in an interview published today 
people didnt think about retreat they were sure they would 
be able to save the ship and so part of the submarines crew 
didnt get a chance to use the lifesaving equipment on board 
adm felix n gromov told the defense ministry newspaper red star 
the nuclearpowered submarine carrying two nucleartipped 
missiles caught fire and sank friday killing 42 of its crew of 69 
the soviet navy plans to raise the ship from its resting place 
4950 feet deep to determine the exact cause of the disaster 
soviet television reported gromov was quoted as telling the 
newspaper that the ships logbook has been recovered along with 
many other documents 
he said it was clear the construction of certain lifesaving 
devices on board must be improved but final conclusions about 
what caused the accident and its high death toll will be made by a 
government commission 
soviet officials say there is no danger of radiation leakage 
from the submarine because the crew shut down its reactors and 
neither of its torpedoes was armed for combat 
the submarines captain yevgeny vanin pulled a sailor through 
a smokefilled hatch and then died as he struggled to reach his 
crew according to soviet media reports 
some survivors waited for rescue in freezing waters for an hour 
and a half only 19 of the 42 bodies have been recovered 
the government newspaper izvestia said a short circuit probably 
caused the fire as the submarine was heading to port after a long 
voyage

a judge has overturned the firing of a 
police officer who failed to break into an apartment where a girl 
was being raped 
judge thomas rakowski ruled tuesday that patrolman james horka 
who waited nearly 30 minutes to go inside during the 1987 attack 
could reasonably have made the judgment call to not crash the 
door based on the information he had 
we dont want policemen to believe that they have to take a 
position of dont wait draw your guns and crash the door or 
your jobs on the line the judge said 
police chief steven rhoads said horka 40 will be back on the 
job monday 
though the 12yearold victims mother begged police to go 
inside horka and two other officers waited nearly a half hour 
before rescuing the girl 
horka the senior officer at the scene said he waited for the 
landlord to arrive with a key because he feared the girl and her 
10yearold brother might be killed if police forced their way in 
i couldnt have lived with that horka said no matter 
what judgment call you make the department can say you were wrong 
they werent there and i have to live with it 
a fourth officer later arrived entered the apartment through an 
unlocked back door and arrested a suspect who is awaiting trial 
horka was dismissed a year ago by the city fire and police 
commission the two other officers were suspended for up to three 
weeks 
i think the judge is going to get a lot of heat and rightly 
so said edward t stein a lawyer for the girls family the 
message that is very dangerous for the public is who do you 
call when you cant call the police 
the girls family declined comment the family is suing horka 
and three other officers 
the judge upheld one charge against horka late filing of a 
report but noted that the officer could not be fired for such an 
infraction he sent the case back to the commission for 
consideration of a lesser penalty

a plane loaded with medical supplies 
and toys took off for the dominican republic today in a charity 
drive that began with an appeal for spoons 
it started with 100 spoons and now were well over 130 
boxes john tomaszewski said tuesday 
the coast guard c130 cargo plane left patrick henry 
international airport with almost 3000 pounds of supplies for the 
childrens colony hospital in santiago 
tomaszewskis wife chris visited the caribbean nation in 
december to return a 3yearold boy the couple had housed while he 
was in the united states for surgery the tomaszewskis are foster 
parents for heal the children an organization based in spokane 
wash that arranges for third world children to receive medical 
care in this country 
during her visit mrs tomaszewski went to the childrens 
hospital which was so illequipped that patients with severe cuts 
had to bring their own thread for stitches 
instead of my eyes just filling with tears my heart filled 
with i have to do something mrs tomaszewski said when you 
see children hurting or hungry or so sad its a human instinct 
a nun at the hospital said the children needed metal spoons that 
could be sterilized so they wouldnt get sick from eating with 
their hands 
mrs tomaszewski went home with pictures of the hospital and 
started asking for help individuals and community groups 
responded and the couples home quickly began filling up with 
spoons baby cribs linens an examination table a microscope 
bandages stethoscopes toys clothes and vitamins 
everybody was more than eager to help with the spoons i think 
we ended up with 500 spoons along with medical supplies ms 
tomaszewski said 
the supplies eventually were moved to a warehouse at the coast 
guard reserve training center at yorktown where tomaszewski works 
as a quartermaster 
the tomaszewskis will travel with the supplies and return a 
10yearold burn victim who has been getting treatment in the 
united states mrs tomaszewski said she has sent a message about 
the shipment to the nun who had been pessimistic that any supplies 
would reach the hospital 
weve arranged for the chamber of commerce over there to bring 
her to the airport mrs tomaszewski said i know that her eyes 
are going to fall out of her head

rep bill alexander dark charged today 
that house minority whip newt gingrich improperly used a book 
promotional fund to further his ambition for a house gop leadership 
position 
alexander who filed a formal complaint against gingrich with 
the house ethics committee tuesday made the accusation against the 
georgia republican during an appearance on cbs this morning 
mr gingrich has cooked up a book scheme that has collected 
him 105000 that he has used to travel around the country to 
campaign for republican leader alexander said he has not 
reported it as either a contribution or a gift 
gingrich said his 1984 book and the limited partnership set up 
to promote it were legitimite enterprises unlike house speaker 
jim wrights book reflections of a public man which is the 
subject of an ethics committee investigation initiated by gingrich 
we had a real book with a real publisher bought by real 
people gingrich said he had a phony book with a phony 
publisher bought by lobbyists 
alexander in announcing the filing of his ethics complaint 
tuesday characterized gingrich as a congressional jimmy swaggart 
who condemns sin while committing hypocrisy 
the complaint which lists 10 alleged violations of house rules 
was filed as the ethics committee neared the conclusion of its 
deliberations on whether to bring charges against wright dtexas 
if you have a picnic flies come to the watermelon gingrich 
said when asked about the timing of alexanders complaint were 
in the middle of an exciting period and mr alexander decided this 
was the right moment for him to do something 
under house rules the filing of the complaint will force the 
ethics panel known formally as the committee on standards of 
official conduct to vote on whether to launch a preliminary 
investigation of gingrich the chairman and ranking republican must 
place the complaint before the panel within 30 days or it comes up 
automatically at the next meeting 
the complaint centers on a limited partnership created to 
promote the book window of opportunity a conservative view of 
the future written by gingrich his wife marianne gingrich and 
david drake 
the partnership had 21 investors who put up 5000 each to 
promote the book in exchange for a promise of half of the profits 
that normally would have gone to the publisher the publisher 
however lost money on the book and the investors got a tax 
writeoff 
gingrich who has denied any wrongdoing with the book deal said 
tuesday the partnership was his wifes responsibility and i dont 
have any control over that 
but he said he is preparing detailed answers to 40 written 
questions about the book deal that have been submitted to his 
office by democratic congressmen and reporters since the existence 
of the partnership was disclosed in news reports last month he did 
not say when those answers would be ready 
gingrich said his wife who has acknowledged receiving less than 
10000 from the partnership for setting up the deal and 
coordinating the promotional effort resents the implication in 
alexanders complaint that she was used to funnel money to him in 
violation of house rules 
he said she has contacted an attorney to determine if she has 
grounds for legal action 
in addition to the promotional deal gingrich said the book 
involved a standard royalty contract in which he and his wife each 
received 3 percent royalties and drake 2 percent 
alexander said the payments gingrich characterizes as royalties 
do not fit the definition in house rules because of the unique 
promotional deal associated with the book consequently he argued 
those payments are not exempt from the house rule limiting outside 
earned income as royalties are 
alexander also alleged that the promotional deal amounted to 
four apparent violations of house limitations on gifts one 
instance of possible conversion of campaign funds to personal use 
two possible instances of conversion of government resources to 
personal use one apparent violation of house financial disclosure 
rules and one apparent violation of the campaign finance law

a jury considering the bribery case 
against three california executives charged in the pentagon 
corruption case resumed deliberations today after failing to reach 
a verdict in two days 
the four women and eight men informed us district judge 
richard williams late tuesday that they had not come to a decision 
after a total of 20 hours of deliberations 
williams said he would give the jury new instructions today if 
they were having problems with the charges 
dale schnittjer eugene sullivan and george kaub three former 
vice presidents of teledyne electronics of newbury park calif 
are charged with bribery conspiracy and wire fraud in the first 
case brought to trial since the government ill wind 
investigation into fraud and kickbacks at the pentagon began nearly 
three years ago 
kaub is also charged with two counts of filing false statements 
the case involves what prosecutors say was a conspiracy to bribe 
a navy official for information about a 24 million contract that 
teledyne obtained in july 1987 to build handheld radar test sets 
the government claims the defendants knew that william parkin a 
private consultant hired by teledyne electronics was paying bribes 
to stuart berlin the navy official 
both parkin and berlin as well as teledyne industries the 
parent of teledyne electronics have pleaded guilty in the case and 
are cooperating with government 
but the defendants said they didnt know parkin had done 
anything illegal 
kaub schnittjer and sullivan testified parkin was hired for 
10000 for his expertise in november 1985 
he was promised 150000 if teledyne won the radar contract 
which it did parkin was paid about 18000 before the payments 
stopped when the ill wind case was made public

city authorities today suspended the 
director of the hospital department where four assistant nurses 
have confessed to killing at least 49 patients in the past six 
years 
the suspension followed mounting criticism of the chief doctors 
conduct during a police investigation last year at viennas lainz 
hospital where elderly patients reportedly were killed by 
overdoses of medicine or by forcing water into their lungs senior 
police investigator max edelbacher said monday that police met a 
wall of silence at the hospital during the probe 
a police report says the department head dr franz pesendorfer 
had declined to give police the name of a second doctor who 
alerted pesendorfer to suspicions about the killings after talking 
with a chileanborn nurses assistant 
the four assistant nurses claim they engaged in mercy 
killings but police said the methods they used made that motive 
unlikely 
the neue kronen zeitung austrias largest circulation tabloid 
said today that if pesendorfer and the second doctor had not kept 
quiet it would fairly certainly have been possible to stop the 
series of murders a year ago 
as it was however the sadistic nurses could kill another 22 
people the newspaper added police have not confirmed media 
reports that 22 of the 49 people killed were slain in the last year 
alone 
mayor helmut zilk said he was suspending pesendorfer head of 
the first medical department at lainz hospital on the grounds of 
the results to date of the police investigations he declined 
further comment 
alois stacher chief of the citys health department said 
pesendorfer was suspended because of lingering lack of clarity 
over the investigation 
pesendorfer consistently has defended his role in the 
investigation and the conduct of officials in his department at the 
lainz hospital viennas fourth largest since the first word of 
the killings on friday 
the doctor and other hospital officials declined comment today 
the chileanborn nurses assistant dorah eugenie 
ferradaavendano was questioned by police tuesday and arrested 
after she admitted to witnessing one of the killings edelbacher 
said but he told the associated press he would try to free the 
woman because she has really helped the police 
ms ferradaavendano knew of killings at the hospital two or 
three years before she told the unidentified doctor of her 
suspicions last year edelbacher said on television tuesday 
he described her as a single parent who as a foreigner was 
afraid of losing her job if she went to police a former patient at 
the hospital who knows the woman now an austrian citizen told the 
associated press she feared political persecution if forced to 
return to chile 
assistant nurses maria gruber 25 irene leidorf 27 and 
waltraud wagner 30 have been in custody since friday stephanie 
mayer was detained sunday none of the women has been charged 
police said the four women confessed they killed at least 49 
patients and that ms wagner admitted killing 39 of them 
pesendorfer is the first doctor or official suspended because of 
the mass killings

a namibian guerrilla leader today 
rejected south africas plan to interrogate insurgents who report 
to un peacekeepers to be escorted back to bases in angola 
by midday today territorial police said no guerrillas of the 
southwest africa peoples organization had shown up at any of nine 
checkpoints established tuesday by the un force monitoring 
namibias transition to independence 
it is not the business of south africa to interrogate or check 
swapo cadres it the business of untag and untag alone guerrilla 
official kapuka nauyala said today of the un transition 
assistance group 
sam nujoma swapos exiled president has called on his fighters 
to withdraw as part of an agreement to get the un independence 
plan back on track after heavy fighting last week 
south africa says about 1900 guerrillas infiltrated into 
northern namibia starting april 1 the day a ceasefire was to take 
hold un investigators agree the guerrillas violated a peace 
accord requiring they stay in angolan bases at least until may 15 
territorial officials said tuesday the united nations had agreed 
that police supervised by un peacekeepers could interrogate 
guerrillas who report to the checkpoints about the whereabouts of 
other insurgents and possible arms caches 
but a un official speaking on condition of anonymity no such 
agreement was reached 
nauyala swapos chief representative in zimbabwe said any 
questioning by security forces would be unacceptable 
untag will commit a monumental sin if it allows itself to be 
coopted into south africas campaign aimed at discrediting and 
humiliating swapo and its military cadres nauyala told the 
zimbabwe interafrican news agency 
black african nations last week denounced the special un envoy 
to namibia martti ahtisaari who outraged them by allowing south 
africaled security forces out of bases to fight the guerrilla 
incursion 
white security force officers and namibian civilians who support 
swapo predict few guerrillas will report to the checkpoints they 
cite the deployment of security force personnel at the points the 
proximity of military bases and poor communication between 
guerrilla commanders and their forces 
police said some guerrillas might try to cross into angola 
without reporting to checkpoints and others might hide their 
weapons don civilian clothes and try to stay in namibia 
police chief inspector derrick brune said groups of insurgents 
were seen today moving south away from the angola border 
no major skirmishes have been reported since last weekend south 
africa says 263 guerrillas and 27 security force members were 
killed in fighting that erupted april 1 swapo says 38 of its 
fighters and 54 civilians were killed another 15 guerrillas were 
captured 
south africa has ruled the mineralrich territory north of its 
border since world war i and in defiance of un demands it 
withdraw 
in december pretoria agreed to give namibia independence in 
exchange for cuba withdrawing its 50000 troops from angola where 
they supported the marxist governments forces in a civil war 
against rebels backed by south africa 
swapo has been fighting south african rule since 1966

mountains today and police said the barrage killed four people and 
wounded 17

boulevard near fish restaurants in moslem west beiruts raouche 
district 
french ambassador paul blanc told reporters a shell hit the 
french embassy compound in the christian hazmiyeh suburb causing 
damage but no injuries 
christian and moslem forces accused each other of ordering 
gunners to target residential districts of beirut 
counting todays casualties 184 people have died and 636 have 
been wounded since the latest round of fighting in the civil war 
began march 8 between gen michel aouns mostly christian army and 
an alliance of syrian and druse forces 
also today a lebanese christian security guard at the us 
embassy was found dead from a shot to the head police reported

sixmember arab league panel the politicians led by phalange 
party leader george saadeh discussed ways of ending lebanons 
14yearold civil war the panel formed in january already has 
met with lebanese moslem and religious leaders 
the christian voice of lebanon radio said syrian gunners 
provoked todays artillery barrage by shelling several areas in the 
310squaremile christian enclave northeast of beirut 
the moslemrun voice of the nation blamed the escalation on 
christian gunners and said they were targeting the raouche district 
civilians rushed back in to bunkers and underground bomb 
shelters shopkeepers lowered their shutters and employees ran out 
of their offices as the thud of exploding shells rocked the city 
last week syrian rockets set fire to a depot containing nearly 
twothirds of lebanons fuel reserves the resulting fuel shortage 
has reduced power supplies in some areas to one hour a day 
the worst fighting in four years started after aoun who also 
heads the christian military cabinet in lebanons divided 
government ordered a blockade of ports run by moslem militias he 
said the illegally operated ports were costing the state treasury 
100 million in lost import dues 
in retaliation druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive 
socialist party militia shelled beirut port and the christian 
enclave 
later syrian gunners joined in the shelling and supported a 
land blockade of the christian heartland by moslem troops of maj 
gen sami khatib 
the rival christian and moslem governments emerged sept 22 
when outgoing president amin gemayel appointed aoun a maronite 
catholic like him to head an interim military cabinet pending 
parliaments election of a new head of state 
prosyrian moslems rejected aouns appointment which violated a 
45yearold tradition that gave the premiership to the sunni 
moslems the house speakership to the shiite moslems and the 
presidency to the maronites 
the division threatens lebanon with permanent sectarian 
partition

the chairman of the democratic party 
emphatically rejected today the prospect of a fresh revision of the 
partys rules governing its presidential nominating process 
i have absolutely no intention to appoint empower or create 
any kind of rules commission said ronald h brown 
the party chairman made the statement during a news conference 
at which he announced appointment of party senior staff 
several party activists including robert beckel who was walter 
mondales campaign manager in his 1984 presidential try have 
proposed taking a new look at party rules 
while rejecting such suggestions brown said he would support 
one change to restore the status of democratic national committee 
members as socalled super delegates at the next convention super 
delegates are party and elected officials who go to the convention 
uncommitted to any presidential candidate and have the potential 
for breaking any deadlock 
at the 1988 convention the dnc members lost their automatic 
super delegate status to meet a demand from jesse jackson 
named senior adviser to the democratic national committee was 
jack martin a texan who ran sen lloyd bentsens last two 
reelection campaigns 
the new political director of the dnc will be paul tully who 
has close ties to sen edward m kennedy dmass and who also 
worked on the presidential campaigns of walter f mondale gary 
hart and michael dukakis 
named director of finance was melissa moss who has been 
principal fund raiser for the democratic leadership council a 
group of elected officials who banded together in 1985 to counter 
what they believed was the leftward drift of the national party 
continuing as communications director will be michael mccurry 
in rejecting the idea of another revision of the partys rules 
brown said we dont win or lose election because of rules i 
frankly think if would be foolhardy for this party to spend the 
next two years in a bloody and divisive fight over the rules 
after presidential election defeats in 1968 1972 and 1980 the 
democrats engaged in sweeping revisions of the party rules adfter 
the 1984 defeat the party went through a more modest change

hope turned to horror in a small texas 
town where residents had been raising money to help a family find 
their missing 21yearold son 
news of the discovery of the body of mark kilroy with at least 
11 others slain in apparent satanic rituals on a ranch in mexico 
quickly spread through the town about 30 miles south of houston 
kilroy disappeared a month ago 
its like a nightmare said mary delahoussaye a close 
friend of kilroys mother helen i really cant believe it 
helen and i said it over and over that we just want to wake up and 
not believe that its true 
doris williams a clerk at a convenience store said even 
though it had been almost a month everyone was really hoping hed 
still be alive everybodys heart is going out to that family 
cheryl gautier who was dining tuesday at the busy bee cafe 
said most people felt that when they found him hed be dead 
but i didnt want to discourage anyone from thinking otherwise i 
thought hed be dead probably shot but the manner in which he was 
killed is unreal 
santa fe residents have been donating their time and money to 
help mrs kilroy and her husband james search for their son 
last weekend proceeds from a citywide garage sale and carwash 
went toward a fund set up for the kilroys 
a yellow ribbon ceremony had been scheduled for today to draw 
attention to kilroys disappearance the ceremony was being turned 
into a memorial service 
this little town is real supportive were like a big 
family joe nichols state prison guard said of the community of 
5400 they may not know you but they support you 
its nice to see santa fe help each other to get money for 
his parents to go down there and try to find him its nice said 
victor lapoint a cashier at the busy bee cafe 
since kilroys disappearance during a spring break excursion 
the family had distributed about 20000 fliers in brownsville and 
matamoros as well as appealing to state lawmakers to help with the 
search 
law officers on both sides of the border had been stumped by the 
disappearance with no clues despite an intensive search the 
questioning of nearly 100 people and a 15000 reward 
kilroys disappearance also was reenacted for a segment on the 
fox television networks americas most wanted program 
the mother of bill huddleston one of the students with kilroy 
the night he vanished took the kilroys from their santa fe home to 
the airport tuesday for the trip to brownsville near the mexican 
town where the bodies were found 
helen kilroy of course is very upset after finding out the 
news that it really was mark down there gwen huddleston said 
they went down there in hopes that it wouldnt be but it didnt 
turn out that way

beaches near the polluted port town of valdez alaska smell 
like gas stations residents there report 
oil along the shoreline is so thick in some areas that cleanup 
workers often slip and fall they wear hard hats to protect 
themselves 
the more that americans find out about the largest oil spill in 
us history the more outrageous the tragedy becomes 
the spill will not and should not fade quickly into the 
nations memory regulatory changes are in order 
national and state governments must make the cost of damaging 
the environment high enough to force the oil and shipping 
industries to act more responsibly promises are not enough

the news tribune woodbridge nj on banning atlantic ocean 
oil drilling 
us rep jim courter rnj has authored a bill which calls 
for a 10year moratorium on exploratory drilling in the atlantic 
ocean in the wake of the exxon valdez oil spill off alaska our 
support of his bill is stronger than ever 
the mind boggles over the possible effect of a major spill off 
the heavily populated east coast 
the oil industry can counter with a strong argument if we kiss 
the domestic exploration goodbye then its only a matter of time 
before the domestic supply dries up and reliance on foreign 
suppliers grows 
we are going to have to continue drilling as long as we rely 
heavily on fossil fuels for energy and remain a nation of energy 
gluttons 
what the exxon valdez disaster must do is increase our 
determination to seek alternative sources such as solar grain 
alcohols and nuclear and we must pursue that dream of all dreams 
fusion

the news and courier charleston sc on the teamsters union 
there is good news and bad news in the justice departments 
recent settlement of a lawsuit against the international 
brotherhood of teamsters it will not guarantee that the worlds 
largest labor union will be corruptionfree but it does promise a 
longoverdue cleanup 
the 16 millionmember teamsters union has agreed to some 
fundamental reforms to avoid a federal racketeering trial that 
could have led to a government takeover it has also agreed that 
rankandfile union members would for the first time be allowed 
to vote in elections of topranking union leaders 
members will nominate and elect union officials who heretofore 
have been handpicked by the executive council and a 
courtappointed administrator armed with special authority should 
give a modicum of credibility to a new teamster era 
the deal however is not without serious shortcomings the 
unions old guard which has become synonomous with organized 
crime remains in place 
its a new and long journey toward democracy the teamsters have 
embarked upon and the outofcourt settlement with the justice 
department is only the first tentative step

the duluth minn newstribune on president bushs education 
proposals 
president bushs proposals for education might be considered 
too modest by his political opponents and too varied by those who 
can only see education dollars in terms of teacher salaries but 
the program he outlined last week represents a solid progressive 
start in improving american education 
it is positively radical compared with his predecessors 
inclinations for federal education programs 
bush wants to spend 423 million on such things as grants for 
successful schools scholarships for students who excel in math and 
science and funding of magnet schools to expand parental choice 
other efforts would put more nonteachers in classrooms set up 
antidrug programs reward excellent teachers and help black 
colleges build up endowments 
nothing is settled at this point the funding will no doubt 
undergo changes as congress deliberates these and other measures 
but given the constraints imposed by deficits there is every 
reason to be optimistic about bushs plans for education

the charleston wva gazette on the alaska oil spill 
exxons alaska oil spill shows dramatically that giant 
corporations with highpriced executives and stateoftheart 
equipment can perform at the moron level 
the captain of the exxon valdez boarded his craft drunk and 
allowed an unqualified unlicensed third mate to pilot the vessel 
the mate bungled the simple task of steering a straight path 
through a placid channel 10 miles wide hitting first one rock 
then proceeding to hit another 
the hull ruptured releasing 11 million gallons of oil that 
would not have been a problem on many carriers they have a second 
hull to catch or limit a spill but the exxon valdez didnt have 
such a protective inner shell 
exxon leaders at first denied any major responsiblity exxon 
leaders finally apologized 10 days later by that time the spill 
had spread to an area larger than rhode island and had fouled more 
than 800 miles of beaches 
there is plenty of blame to go around guilty parties however 
are unlikely ever to be prosecuted to the extent they have fouled 
polluted and upset natures balance in a unique region of america

blame it on the heat blame it on spring fever blame it on 
ufos blame it on well take your pick 
how else to explain the zany plan that calls for dressing up 
texas national guardsmen as cacti so that they could sneak up on 
drug smugglers under the cover of darkness and a mantle of thorns 
to gather intelligence for federal authorities waiting to swoop 
down on the evildoers 
the proposal according to texas national guard lt col ed 
komandosky envisions cactusattired troops working areas of 
suspected drug smuggling along the usmexico border 
it is a cockamamie idea in the first place the guard 
should not be enlisted in the war on drugs guardsmen are not 
trained as policemen 
secondly it casts guardsmen in the role of standup comedians 
or cartoon characters 
finally it would not work does the brain trust responsible for 
this silly idea really think that drug runners are so easily 
fooled 
alerted to the guards trickery by the advance publicity 
smugglers scarcely would wait for the cactusclad guardsmen to make 
the first move instead the drug runners would plug every cactus

the westerly ri sun on financing congressional election 
campaigns 
theres nothing new about indignant cries that the method of 
financing congressional election campaigns has to be improved 
the latest compilation of data by common cause provides fresh 
reason to demand reform even more urgently 
william proxmire who recently retired after serving for a long 
time as a senator from wisconsin acted as a kind of 
selfappointed watchdog over public spending and long opposed 
reliance on the political action committee for major campaign 
funding 
in the last election candidates for a seat in the house of 
representatives accepted a record 996 million from pacs the 
bulk of it went to incumbents seeking reelection there were 408 
of them and they got 822 million from the pacs the 328 
challengers in contrast received only 9 million 
when a pac contributes heavily to a candidates war chest there 
is at very least an unspoken quid pro quo we must change the 
system to minimize that influencebuying factor

hold down spending but that cant justify the level of spending 
president bush has recommended on the nations debt to

congress and former president reagan agreed that 500 million 
should be appropriated this next fiscal year to begin paying 
reparations to these citizens who were forced from their homes 
during the war bush has proposed a 20 million appropriation 
thats both tragic and ridiculous its tragic because the 
survivors of these camps are dying now at the rate of about 200 a

would take 60 years to complete the reparation payments

los angeles times on the prochoice abortion rally 
at least 300000 people marched in washington sunday to leave a 
message for the us supreme court 
whether the court reads such messages is a matter of debate 
among legal scholars but the crowd of men mothers and daughters 
celebrities and ordinary believers in the cause could not have made 
a more coherent statement one with which we absolutely agree 
government has no right to pry into a decision as deeply personal 
private and agonizing as the one that every year leads 16 million 
women to have abortions 
the march the largest ever seen in the capital was timed to 
catch the courts attention as it near the april 26 date for 
argument in a missouri abortion case the court is being asked by 
antiabortion forces to use the missouri case as a vehicle to 
reverse the 1973 decision in the case of roe vs wade that made 
abortion legal under federal law 
the march also was intended as a reminder that abortion is a 
powerful symbol of the rights of women even the many who oppose 
abortion because it involves decisions they are determined to make 
for themselves about their health and the life they will lead 
the court must look beyond legal principles to tenable social 
policy and good sense and both dictate that the right of a woman 
to choose to terminate a pregnancy meets both of those tests

the patriot harrisburg pa on the soviet elections 
the recent voting for members to the congress of the peoples 
deputies was the first relatively open election held in the soviet 
union in 70 years 
and remarkable as it may seem given our far greater experience 
at democracy the soviet election may have something instructive to 
offer the american political system 
whether the elected peoples deputies get to exercise any degree 
of power remains to be seen nevertheless the stunning number of 
high and mighty who were defeated dealt what the new york times 
headlined was a mortifying blow to party officials 
the magnitude of the revolt was made extraordinary by the 
substantial number of candidates who were defeated even though they 
ran without opposition voters were able to cross out the name of 
unopposed candidates and thus register a no vote 
if americans could vote none of the above or against an 
unopposed candidate we suspect many more would go to the polls 
the question is would our politicians dare to give the people 
the option of voting for none of the above

lenin spin his tomb 
poland has announced that the government and the outlawed 
labor union solidarity have reached an accord that will make free 
elections possible again poles have not voted in democratic 
elections since 1945 
the first ballot this year is guaranteed to give the communist 
party almost a twothirds majority but the agreement throws the 
electoral process wide open in subsequent elections 
few people besides the democrats in poland like solidarity 
leader lech walesa thought this day would come 
but its also true that few people at least in the west 
thought they ever would see russians able to vote for anything that 
resembles a democratic ballot soviets some of them within sight 
of lenins tomb in moscow voted in open elections three weeks ago 
the west led by the united states cant be a pollyana in the 
face of rapid changes but neither can any peaceloving western 
nation overlook opportunities to defuse world tensions and make 
additional democratic reforms attractive to the east

of the sea 
an asian fleet of 1000 to 1500 vessels deploys as many as 
30000 miles of drift net each day floating 30 feet down from the 
ocean surface the finemeshed nylon nets catch not only fish and 
squid but everything else they encounter dolphins whales birds 
and sea lions 
perhaps even worse the nets are inefficient wasting about half 
the catch that is killed but then lost overboard 
under the drift net impact monitoring assessment and control act 
of 1987 the united states has been negotiating with japan south 
korea and taiwan to place observers on their ships to determine 
just how damaging driftnet fishing is 
the immediate task facing the united states is to get its 
observers onto the asian driftnet vessels us negotiators 
must make it clear to the asian governments that this country is

a concorde jet with 100 americans 
aboard lost a ninefoot piece of its tail today while attempting 
the aircrafts first supersonic circumnavigation of the globe but 
it landed safely in sydney 
it wasnt till we got out of the plane and saw the firetrucks 
and all the pressthat we knew something was wrong said 
american journalist william buckley jr who helped organize the 
trip which cost each passenger 39000 
part of the rudder disintegrated while the british airways 
supersonic jet was flying at 40000 feet at about 1500 mph 
nearly twice the speed of sound from christchurch new zealand 
said peter stanton an airline spokesman 
it experienced a shudder while over the tasman sea that was 
thought to have been air turbulence said stanton 
he said the pilot was unaware of any problem until he was 
alerted by the control tower at sydneys kingsfordsmith 
international airport 
but another passenger on the 1000mile flight which lasted one 
hour and 25 minutes said the plane shuddered and the passengers 
were tense 
buckley said there is a possibility they british airways 
will find a defect that will result in the grounding of other 
concordes but obviously theyre hoping that wont be so that this 
is simply an eccentric fluke 
it was a normal landing there was no emergency stanton 
said the pilot capt david leney was told by the control tower 
that a piece of the tail was missing there were no injuries 
among the 100 passengers all americans on the 38343mile journey 
that started april 1 in london 
pat boody a british airways airport service manager said the 
cause of the tail problem was being investigated and that the plane 
would not be allowed to fly unless it is absolutely safe 
australian associated press said the concorde was about 15 years 
old and apparently had never experienced any problems 
im glad that it was a plane that could manage without that 
much superfluous tail said buckley 
if we had nosedivedinto the tasmanian sea there would have 
been a considerable reaction but one simply assumes that nothing 
fatal has happened if indeed there is no confirmation nor any 
visible invalidation of the ships performance he said 
in london a british airways spokeswoman said the airline was 
sending out spare parts to australia to repair the plane which 
would go on to perth australia on friday as scheduled and then to 
africa before returning to london another spokesman said the tail 
sections of other concordes were being checked 
the concorde had been trying to break the speed record on all 
stops making about 12 in all the planned threeweek journey 
includes stops in exotic locations like colombo sri lanka and 
mombassa kenya 
during the trip buckley planned to broadcast his television 
show firing line from cape town south africa and sydney 
passenger sheila cole nilva a freelance journalist telephoned 
the associated press with the following account 
about 25 minutes after takeoff from new zealand there was a 
large thump it was like a vibration nothing was said about the 
thump but everybody looked at everybody else and lunch was served 
the stewardesses looked terrified 
the pilot came on and said there was nothing to worry about 
and that there was a piece loose on the airplane she said we 
descended very quickly there was no conversation and then the 
shuddering stopped 
concordes built by a frenchbritish consortium have been 
involved in several minor incidents but there have been no major 
accidents 
in february british airways gave its fleet of concorde jets a 
clean bill of health after safety checks following the discovery of 
small cracks in the roof structure of one plane the airline made 
what it called precautionary checks on five concordes that had made 
more than 3500 landings

president roh taewoo said wednesday 
that labor unrest has cost south korea 600 million in exports this 
year and threatens to destroy the nations economic achievements 
our economy now stands at the crossroads roh told a meeting 
of top economic officials and business leaders in addition to the 
lost exports labor problems have resulted in a drop in the 
countrys production of 24 billion he said 
there have been 395 labor disputes in south korea this year up 
27 percent from a year ago and 282 cases have been settled 
according to the labor ministry 
in the past south korean workers rights were curbed by 
authoritarian rule but a prodemocracy movement in the past two 
years has encouraged workers to demand more 
roh said exports have been sluggish after years of high growth 
and that investment has been shrinking because of labor disputes 
coupled with the rising value of the korean won a strong won makes 
korean exports to the us more expensive 
korea also is under us pressure to open wider its market to 
american products and services 
last month south korea suffered its first trade deficit in 19 
months 
roh urged labor and management to refrain from confrontation in 
seeking to settle their disputes 
the federation of korean industries and five other national 
economic organizations in a joint statement said labor disputes 
should be settled through dialogue and reconciliation 
on march 30 about 14000 police stormed the hyundai shipyard in 
the southeastern city of ulsan to break a 109day strike by 
thousands of workers allegedly supported by outsiders who had

chinas premier li peng arrived wednesday on the 
first visit to japan by a chinese head of state in seven years and 
japanese officials said he played down his countrys growing ties 
with the soviet union 
in talks with prime minister noboru takeshita li also expressed 
support for japans position in a long territorial dispute with 
moscow and welcomed increased japanese investment in china a 
foreign ministry official said 
the ministry official who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity quoted takeshita as telling li that close ties with 
china were an important pillar of japanese foreign policy 
we hope the improved relations between china and the soviet 
union wont have an adverse effect on good chinajapanese 
relations takeshita was quoted as saying we hope the 
improvements will be carried out in such a way that they will 
promote peace in all of asia 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is scheduled to visit 
beijing in may for the first sovietchinese summit in 30 years the 
communist countries split in 1960 over bitter ideological and 
strategic differences 
the official quoted li as saying beijing and moscow had made 
some progress but no major progress toward closer relations in 
the areas of economics technology and science 
but china will continue to follow a foreign policy of 
independence and selfreliance the official quoted him as saying 
li said china supported japans demand that moscow return a 
group of islands off northern japan that it seized at the end of 
world war ii the official added the dispute over the kuril 
islands has been a major obstacle to the improvement of 
sovietjapanese relations 
the official said li expressed pleasure over increased 
japanesechinese trade which totaled a record 193 billion last 
year according to japanese figures 
although japan provides 80 percent of chinas credit and serves 
as its secondlargest trading partner after hong kong it accounts 
for only 8 percent of chinas total foreign investment 
japanese reluctance to invest in chinese industries apparently 
has grown in recent months due to a chinese austerity program aimed 
at reducing inflation some factories have been cut off from credit 
and raw materials 
shortly before lis arrival japans parliament approved an 
investment protection agreement signed during a visit by takeshita 
to china last summer and already ratified by beijing the pact 
guarantees japanese investors in china will receive equal treatment 
with chinese businesses 
lis visit is the first to japan by a chinese premier since zhao 
ziyang now communist party head visited in may 1982

about 100 newspaper editors sat down after 
breakfast wednesday about the time millions of their readers were 
turning to the comic pages to discuss whether cathy should be 
political and what to do when the kids grow up in for better or 
worse 
serious issues these so there wasnt a single outburst of 
laughter when members of the american society of newspaper editors 
attended a convention workshop on what funnies they print 
how serious 
well the people who draw the comics are referred to as 
artists among those who review their works for the syndicates 
that sell them to newspapers are lawyers who have a field day with 
doonesbury and editors who sometimes must negotiate with an 
artist to tone down a characters offcolor language 
and newspaper editors who decide that a strip has gone too far 
and yank it from the paper for a day or two had better brace some 
readers are sure to hurl the ugly term censor 
pulling a strip draws so much attention to it and to you as a 
censor that youre reluctant to do it reported marty claus 
managing editor for features and business at the detroit free press 
in any event she said readers are more worldly than editors 
might think they often dont care to be protected 
people will see that toledo ran it and detroit didnt and 
theyll say let me be the judge of whats off base ms 
claus said 
she plugged for more blacks and other minorities in the comics 
reporting that a monthlong census of all the characters on her 
papers funny pages revealed that fewer than 1 percent were 
nonwhite 
lynn johnston who draws for better or worse the story of a 
family much like hers said she worries about how far to go in 
injecting her opinion into her comic strip she has strong opinions 
on abortion for example and might want to express them in her 
strip but shies away and thinks can i handle it shes 
thinskinned she said and hates hate mail 
on the other hand she said i dont want to be a 
marshmallow 
another problem for ms johnston was whether to let the kids in 
her strip grow old shes decided to its more natural but 
frets im going to grow right out of a job 
she gets heartwarming mail from loyal readers who write 
weve been with you since lizzie was a baby 
ray billingsley the black artist behind curtis a comic 
strip about a black kid said the comics should deal with social 
issues he is itching to do a story line on crack the cocaine 
derivative he said but thinks hed better let curtis who was 
created last october get better established first 
let these strips be bold billingsley advised the editors 
the public is more accepting than many editors think 
editors sensitivities are an old story to lee salem editorial 
director of universal press syndicate who recalled what happened 
last fall when a character in cathy endorsed michael dukakis 
for president 
thirty papers pulled the strip for the twoweek duration of its 
political wallowing and three cancelled it outright but two of 
them quickly came back salem said 
he favors giving artists their freedom after theyve earned it 
artists want to deal with aids animal rights drugs and 
shoplifting and theyre bound to do it he said 
ms claus said they should have as much freedom as columnists 
after all she said their names are on their strips just like a 
columnists byline 
on one point what constitutes a good panel there was full 
agreement a comic strip bats 1000 when it gets clipped out and 
mailed to mom or posted on the refrigerator

democratic party chairman ronald brown saying 
he wanted to avoid a bloody and divisive fight slammed the 
door wednesday on any sweeping reexamination of party rules but 
said he would support restoring automatic delegate status to party 
officials 
browns backing for giving super delegate status to 
democratic national committee members could raise a new conflict 
with jesse jackson 
however brown already was getting caught between jackson and 
party activists who want to eliminate a rule that provides for 
allocating national convention delegates to presidential candidates 
on the basis of the proportion of votes they received in primaries 
or caucuses 
robert beckel manager of walter f mondales 1984 presidential 
campaign is leading an effort to restore rules that would require 
candidates to get a certain percentage of the vote to qualify for 
receiving any delegates 
we have to get closure on this process as early as possible 
said beckel 
told of browns comments beckel said the last thing i want 
to do is get into a fight with ron brown over the rules if 
brown goes to the wall on this thing it would be very difficult to 
do 
beckel said he was not advocating formation of a new rules 
commission he said he hoped the dnc would adopt his proposed 
changes at a meeting next fall 
at the 1988 democratic national convention with brown serving 
as jacksons convention manager new party rules stripped 
democratic national committee members of the automatic delegate 
status for future conventions and instituted proportional 
representation as the basis for selecting delegates 
still jackson contended that minimumvote requirements resulted 
in denying him a proportion of delegates equal to the popular vote 
he received he also viewed the party and elected officials sent to 
the convention as uncommitted super delegates as a force largely 
opposed to his candidacy only a handful of elected officials 
backed jacksons bid for the presidential nomination 
i have absolutely no intention to appoint empower or create 
any kind of rules commission said brown at a news conference at 
which he announced the appointments of senior dnc staff 
we dont win or lose elections because of rules i frankly 
think it would be foolhardy for this party to spend the next two 
years in a bloody and divisive fight over the rules he said 
after presidential election defeats in 1968 1972 and 1980 the 
democrats engaged in sweeping revisions of the party rules after 
the 1984 defeat the party went through a more modest change 
brown also said recent democratic election victories in contests 
to fill vacant house seats were of tremendous national 
significance 
democrat jill long was an upset victor in the contest to fill 
the house seat in indiana once held by vice president dan quayle 
the democrats also held a democratic seat in alabama and are given 
a good chance of capturing the wyoming house seat formerly held by 
dick cheney who resigned to become secretary of defense

the government reported wednesday that 
american businesses plan to boost their plant and equipment 
spending this year by a solid 63 percent which analysts said 
could help forestall a recession 
the commerce department said a survey completed in march found 
companies planning to spend an inflationadjusted 45039 billion 
this year for expansion and modernization which would surpass the 
record 42377 billion spent in 1988 
the pace of growth in 1989 would be slower than the 101 percent 
increase recorded last year but analysts said the anticipated gain 
in capital spending still is healthy and indicates that businesses 
remain optimistic about the economys performance 
continued strength in capital spending and the resulting 
increase in productivity could help extend the life of the economic 
expansion and ease inflationary pressures that have mounted as 
factories in some industries operate at rates near full capacity 
these analysts said 
we think the economy will slow down but we expect that 
because of continued strong capital spending and continued strong 
exports we should be able to avert an outright recession said 
david wyss of data resources inc in lexington mass 
the new estimate for capital spending in 1989 represents an 
increase from an earlier survey released in december when 
businesses said they planned to boost spending by 59 percent this 
year 
the upward revision based on a survey conducted from january 
through march came even as most analysts are predicting the 
economy will cool this year analysts said businesses are likely to 
scale back their spending plans as evidence of a slowdown builds 
the year got off to a good start but what happens from here 
is going to depend on what happens to their markets said robert 
g dederick chief economist for northern trust co in chicago 
the question is are they in fact going to carry out their 
intentions or are they going to be dragged down by developments 
elsewhere 
the federal reserve board has been pushing up interest rates for 
a year in an effort to cool the economy and restrain inflation the 
bush administration and some analysts however have expressed 
concern that the antiinflation campaign could prove too potent and 
unintentionally push the country into a recession 
should the surveys spending estimates be realized that would 
be consistent with what the fed has been desiring a less vigorous 
economy but one which is being led by capital spending dederick 
said 
the 101 percent gain in capital spending last year was the 
biggest percentage increase since a 166 percent rise in 1984 when 
businesses still were recovering from the 198182 recession 
spending had climbed just 23 percent in 1987 and dropped 39 
percent in 1986 
the growth in capital spending last year which came as 
companies rushed to expand production to meet rising export demand 
was credited with helping power strong economic growth in 1988 
however many analysts are worried that last years export boom has 
stalled 
the smaller anticipated increase in capital spending for this 
year includes a 41 percent planned rise for manufacturing 
companies to 17144 billion compared with a 129 percent jump in 
1988 
the projected manufacturing increase includes a 3 percent gain 
in spending at plants that make durable goods items expected to 
last three or more years and a 51 percent increase by companies 
producing nondurable goods 
companies engaged in mining transportation and other 
nonmanufacturing ventures are expected to increase spending by 77 
percent to 27894 billion 
before adjusting for inflation capital spending for 1989 is 
expected to rise by 91 percent to 46878 billion after increasing 
103 percent in 1988

first lady barbara bush underwent radioactive 
treatment today to destroy her thyroid gland because it is 
producing excess levels of hormones a condition that has irritated 
her eyes and caused her to lose 18 pounds in recent months 
shes just fine piece of cake never broke her stride mrs 
bushs press secretary anna perez said after the presidents wife 
returned to the white house following a twohour stay at walter 
reed army medical center 
the radiation was administered in an iodine solution sipped 
through a straw mrs bush said it was a colorless liquid that 
tasted like water ms perez reported 
doctors told mrs bush 63 that the only side effect she may 
suffer is a slight pain in the neck for several days she cracked 
jokes about that all day ms perez said 
moreover just as a precaution she shouldnt hug her puppies 
for a couple of days and she shouldnt kiss her grandchildren 
the spokeswoman said 
she explained that puppies and children have a heightened 
sensitivity to the radiation in mrs bushs body the first lady 
has 11 grandchildren and her dog millie recently produced six 
puppies 
mrs bush expressed surprise that her treatment attracted so 
much news media attention and was wondering why her visit to 
walter reed gets so much coverage when child help a nonprofit 
organization for youngsters doesnt her press secretary said 
a white house statement said the procedure has no significant 
side effects and has been a standard treatment for 40 years for 
people suffering with mrs bushs condition known as graves 
disease 
once her thyroid gland has stopped operating probably in two to 
three months mrs bush will have to take daily medication to 
maintain adequate hormone levels ms perez said 
president bush was asked about his wife at a white house 
ceremony for the college basketball champions while mrs bush was 
still at the hospital he replied fine when asked how she was 
doing 
mrs bush consulted doctors last month because of swelling and 
irritation in her eyes causing them to tear and the sudden weight 
loss 
for several weeks mrs bush has been treated with methimazole 
a drug that blocks production of excess hormones in the thyroid a 
butterflyshaped gland in the neck 
ms perez said the use of drugs was an interim therapy and that 
the destruction of the thyroid through radiation was a more 
permanent treatment 
left untreated graves disease can be lifethreatening but it 
generally responds quickly to therapy 
it is caused when antibodies attack the thyroid gland and cause 
it to secrete too much hormone 
the disease is more apt to occur in older women 
mrs bushs treatment with methimazole was discontinued sunday 
in preparation for todays procedure it will be restarted three 
days after the treatment and then continue until her level of 
thyroid hormones falls below normal 
mrs bush is under the care of white house physicians burton j 
lee iii and lawrence c mohr in consultation with dr kenneth 
burman a thyroid specialist at walter reed

administration decides to end its suspension of such imports 
gun importers have applications to bring in 965000 of the 
weapons pending at the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
according to spokesman dick pedersen 
the import suspension was imposed march 14 after public and 
police outcries over the increased use of the weapons such as 
semiautomatic versions of ak47s and uzi carbines in drugrelated 
violence and the january slayings of five schoolchildren in 
stockton calif 
the suspension covered some 400000 weapons including about 
300000 for which import permits already had been approved last 
week the administration expanded the suspension to cover 240000 
separate weapons 
we noticed the increase in these showing up in crimes an 
increase in demand and we reacted to it pedersen said the 
main thing is that we might be nipping the semiautomatic 
assaulttype rifle in the bud rather than have millions of them 
flooding in here 
nevertheless gun importers are continuing to submit 
applications he said tuesday 
it appears there have been a lot more applications that came 
in after the ban pedersen said 
the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms is required by law 
to permit imports only of weapons suitable or adaptable to 
sporting purposes and it is studying the use of the 
semiautomatic rifles to determine how they are being used the 
review should take two to three months more months 
despite the uproar over such weapons fbi crime statistics 
reveal that most murders by firearms are still committed by people 
wielding handguns of the 17859 murders committed nationwide in 
1987 10556 were committed with firearms of which 7807 were 
handguns according to the fbi 
drug enforcement administration spokesman con dougherty says 
that increasing numbers of powerful and sophisticated handguns such 
as the 9mm semiautomatic particularly guns such as the uzi pistol 
are being confiscated during arrests 
nevertheless pedersen said it is extremely unlikely that the 
current import suspension on rifles will be expanded to any 
handguns 
handguns are used in sport in target shooting extensively 
pedersen said thats negligible as far as assault weapons are 
concerned 
many local and federal police agencies have recently begun to 
arm themselves with foreignmade 9mm semiautomatic handguns he 
said 
it would be up to congress to make any changes in the 
availability of such guns he said 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio has introduced a bill that would 
place some of the same restrictions on both semiautomatic 
machinestyle pistols and assaultstyle rifles that are now imposed 
on automatic weapons including fbi background checks on purchasers 
and fingerprinting but not the 200 fee charged to owners of 
machine guns according to the senators spokeswoman nancy coffey 
among the semiautomatic handguns that would be restricted if 
metzenbaums bill passes are the uzi pistol the ingram mac 10 and 
mac 11 and the tec 9 and tec 22 she said 
about 231000 foreign handguns including semiautomatic weapons 
were imported in 1986 the last year for which pedersen had data 
there was no breakdown for the number of semiautomatic handguns he 
said 
the number of hanguns being imported has been decreasing over 
the years while more than 1 million handguns have been produced 
domestically each year he said 
in 1982 some 332000 handguns were imported followed by 
411000 in 1983 341000 in 1984 and 229000 in 1985 
greg risch of handgun control inc said police are finding 
assaultstyle handguns that have clips that hold 30 40 
sometimes 50 rounds of ammunition but yet are still fairly 
concealable as opposed to an assault rifle that is more 
concealable than a hunting rifle but still a large size

shell western eampp inc has cleared the 
last major hurdle in its quest to become the first company to 
explore for oil in the remote chukchi sea known for extreme ice 
and weather 
the state has signed off on the project between northwest alaska 
and soviet territorial water clearing the way for the federal 
government to issue shell a permit to drill 80 miles northwest of 
alaskas icy cape 
the states ruling that shells plan was consistent with the 
alaska coastal zone management plan came the day before the exxon 
valdez ran aground fouling prince william sound with more than 10 
million gallons of oil in the nations worst spill 
bob grogan director of the alaska division of governmental 
coordination said any proposed development in the chukchi sea 
north of the bering strait likely would be scrutinized carefully 
by the state and federal governments 
virtually anything right now dealing with oil and gas has to 
be taken in context of the valdez disaster grogan said 
theres a tremendous amount of clamor in the lower 48 and 
coastal states for the president to call for a reassessment of the 
outer continental shelf grogan said alaska also is being 
asked to be involved in these discussions the state no doubt 
will be doing its own rethinking 
the us minerals management service already has approved 
shells exploration plan which calls for up to 60 wells on 11 
federal leases over the next four years 
although we have not completed our review we dont anticipate 
any real problem with it said rodney smith the federal agencys 
supervisor of field operations shell should get its permit within 
30 days he said 
shell wants to drill its first well more than 15000 feet deep 
in 140 feet of water this summer it plans to drill from a floating 
rig being refitted in victoria bc 
the state encouraged shell to work with the state department of 
environmental conservation to ensure that its plan contains a 
valid prediction of discharge movement and spreading of an oil 
spill 
the state approval requires shell to employ safeguards to 
protect fish and wildlife particularly walruses that inhabit the 
area

oliver north testified today he thought an 
order to alter documents was designed to hide knowledge by 
president reagan of secret national security council assistance to 
the contras 
north said thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane told 
him to change the documents amid congressional inquiries into the 
nsc staffs assistance to the contras during a ban on military aid 
to the nicaraguan rebels 
norths testimony contradicts mcfarlane who said it was north 
who proposed making changes to the documents in late summer 1985 
the gist of what he wanted removed from the documents was 
language that would indicate his knowledge or the presidents 
knowledge about my activities in this time frame north testified 
on his fifth day on the witness stand 
north said the changes werent done to protect me there 
were people above me 
i didnt think it was unlawful to make changes said north 
because the order came from mr mcfarlane a cabinet officer 100 
steps from the president of the united states i had been led to 
believe that everything i was doing was done at the direction of 
the president 
altering documents asked prosecutor john keker 
yes responded north 
you had been told by the president of the united states to 
destroy documents explain how you had come to that conclusion 
asked keker 
because everything i had done that was described on this list 
i had been told was at the direction of the president said north 
north said he didnt make the alterations in 1985 when mcfarlane 
originally asked him to because he was busy i just didnt get it 
done he said 
also it didnt make sense said north he added that many 
other nsc documents that he was not being asked to change showed 
secret contra assistance 
but north made the changes when mcfarlane nearly a year after 
leaving the government asked him again to do so as the irancontra 
affair unraveled in november 1986 
even though north was acquiescing to a request from someone who 
was no longer in the government you were still a pawn in a chess 
game being played by giants prosecutor john keker asked 
sarcastically 
north made the comment about being a pawn last week in 
testifying about being told by his superiors to attend a meeting 
with the house intelligence committee he is charged with 
obstructing the committees work by making false statements denying 
he was assisting the contras 
you dont need to belittle the comment answered north the 
former nsc aide said he had been referring to the political 
struggle between the executive branch and the congress 
among the alterations in the memos from north to mcfarlane 
deleting references to compensating guatemala for supplying phony 
enduser certificates in connection with arms shipments to the 
contras omitting a reference to approaching donors for contra 
contributions taking out a reference to sustaining the delivery of 
lethal supplies to the rebels 
earlier today north blamed mcfarlane for sending a letter to 
congress that falsely denied the nsc staff was assisting the contra 
rebels in nicaragua 
keker read aloud a section of a proposed response to thenrep 
michael barnes saying none of us has solicited funds or 
coordinated the military efforts of the resistance 
that statement is untrue and i did not put it in there 
north said of the draft letter to barnes dmd he said mcfarlane 
then his boss had written his own letter on sept 12 1985 
what did you do to straighten it out keker asked 
i am quite certain i didnt do much at all north 
replied he said mcfarlane had already put this kind of language 
in his letter on sept 5 1985 to rep lee hamilton dind then 
the chairman of the house intelligence committee 
i wrote a number of other letters that were inconsistent 
with the facts i just simply do not believe i wrote this 
letter said north those words are written in mr 
mcfarlanes handwriting 
keker interjected and apparently sent to you for editing 
and that is a point i would contest because i dont believe it 
was sent to me for editing north said 
among 12 criminal counts north is accused of making a false 
statement to congress in connection with the letters to barnes and 
hamilton no charges have been filed against him in connection with 
letters he says he wrote on contra support to at least one other 
congressman and two senators

assailants hurled firebombs 
inside the frankfurt stock exchange and an electronics firm 
wednesday and police blamed both attacks on supporters of jailed 
terrorists staging a hunger strike 
two employees were slightly injured in the stock exchange attack 
when at least six masked youths entered the main hall before 
opening time and threw firebombs at computer terminals 
security officials seized three attackers but the others 
escaped said frankfurt police spokesman oswald neumann he said 
those held were two women ages 24 and 27 and a 28yearold man 
authorities said the attack destroyed or damaged several 
computers and delayed the opening time by a few minutes 
earlier in the northern city of muenster unidentified 
assailants set off a firebomb inside the offices of the aeg 
electronics firm a subsidiary of the daimlerbenz automotive and 
hightechnology conglomerate 
authorities said the 330 am attack caused millions of dollars 
worth of damage but no injuries 
those attackers got away the federal prosecution spokesman in 
karlsruhe alexander prechtel said supporters of jailed red army 
faction members on a hunger strike claimed responsibility in a 
letter left near the scene 
at least 34 imprisoned terrorists have been fasting to demand a 
special cell block for jailed members of the radical organization 
which seeks to undermine west german capitalism with 
assassinations bank robberies and other attacks 
police said they believe group sympathizers carried out the 
stock exchange attack as well 
we are going on the supposition that this the stock exchange 
attack is in connection with the ongoing hunger strike and demands 
for red army faction inmates to be placed together said neumann 
two of the fasting prisoners christa eckers and karlheinz 
dellwo claim to have subsisted only on vitamins and water for 71 
days they are reported to be in serious condition 
the message left near the electronics firm demanded that the 
hunger strikers be housed together in one or two large groups 
prechtel said 
prechtel said the federal protection office is worried the 
attacks could be a prelude to more violence by sympathizers 
we fear that this is going to continue we can only hope that 
people dont become victims of the attacks prechtel said

will take the national symphony orchestra on a concert tour of the 
soviet union next february 
rostropovich will lead the 103member orchestra in two concerts 
in moscow and two in leningrad he told a news conference at the 
kennedy center which is the orchestras home 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin hinted to reporters that the tour 
could be the next step in restoring soviet citizenship which was 
stripped from rostropovich in 1978 dubinin and the conductor 
embraced with tears in their eyes after the news conference 
lets hope the time will come when all juridical decisions 
will be taken according to the wishes of maestro rostropovich 
dubinin said 
rostropovich said that for artistic freedom there has been 
enormous change in his homeland under soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev he said he was very excited and very nervous about 
making his first official visit to the soviet union since he was 
exiled 15 years ago 
the internationally acclaimed cellist and music director has 
said privately that he and his wife soprano galina vishnevskaya 
would return to their homeland if their citizenship were restored 
and their reputations cleared but he has often said he wants to 
take the orchestra to the soviet union and show them how to play 
russian music 
the soviet media have recently carried several articles urging 
that the couples citizenship which was stripped in 1978 be 
returned the soviet government had accused them of unpatriotic 
activity and acts harmful to the soviet union 
those acts included taking novelist alexander solzhenitsyn into 
their home after he had been driven out of the writers union and

the united states has decided to release 230 
million in economic aid to egypt that had been held up while the 
arab government undertook bureaucratic reforms the state 
department said wednesday 
formal notification to congress is expected by the end of the 
week congress can delay the resumption of aid but legally cannot 
block it besides a us official said there is no serious 
opposition to ending the onemonth suspension 
the 230 million covers cash payments to egypt for this year and 
for 1988 overall egypt is due to receive 163 billion in us 
economic assistance for the two years plus surplus food making it 
the largest us aid recipient except for israel 
congress conditioned delivery of the 230 million in cash 
payments on unspecified reforms in the way egypt administers the 
aid a decision to resume was taken coincide with the visit here 
last week of president hosni mubarak 
in response to a reporters question the state department press 
office issued a statement quoting president bush as saying mubarak 
enjoys our full support as he implements courageous reform 
measures to strengthen egypts economy for future generations 
the statement added our cash transfer assistance will be part 
of that support we will be consulting with congress and working 
out the details of the release of the money in cooperation with the 
egyptian government 
aid to israel and to egypt was boosted after the two countries 
signed a peace treaty in 1979 since then the united states has 
been liberal in assisting the two countries as its most reliable 
friends in the middle east the aid also is a subtle way of 
encouraging israel and egypt to support us foreign policy in the 
region 
at the moment the bush administration is backing a proposal by 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir to hold elections among the 
14 million palestinian arabs who live on the west bank and in gaza 
mubarak has called instead for an international peace conference 
and said the palestine liberation organization should participate 
but mubarak has not rejected the proposal categorically 
the arab league of which egypt is a member and the plo both 
rejected the proposal this week on tuesday the state department 
asked all critics to withhold judgment until the proposal is 
developed 
the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said no 
direct appeal was made to the plo with which the united states 
opened talks last december over israels objections the official 
said another meeting with the plo will be held but not for several 
days at least 
egypt has one of the most cumbersome bureaucracies in the world 
as well as a booming birth rate an estimated 1 million people are 
added to egypts population every 10 months there is widespread 
poverty and housing is at a premium 
mubarak during his visit told american businessmen his 
government was making progress in cutting red tape and in curbing 
population growth but he said the effort was partly offset by a 
decline in the death rate

a consumer advocate said wednesday that the 
us wheat outlook is so shaky that the united states should 
suspend further export subsidies until the situation improves 
rodney e leonard executive director of the private nonprofit 
community nutrition institute said he wrote agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter on april 3 to repeat a similar request made last 
fall when the situation was less precarious and steps could 
have been taken to safeguard supplies 
the target of leonards complaint is the export enhancement 
program which subsidizes the sale of wheat and other commodities 
to selected foreign countries huge sales of wheat to china and the 
soviet union have been made under the program since the arrangement 
was authorized by congress in the 1985 farm law 
yeutter said this week the program had helped significantly in 
getting agricultural trade discussions moving under the current 
uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
but yeutter also said in an interview with a group of reporters 
on monday that the subsidy program would be reviewed to see how 
effective it has been and whether too much or too little is 
being spent on it 
leonard said that the condition of the winter wheat crop is 
deteriorating and that experts in the agriculture department and in 
the major production areas point to a harvest this year of about 
16 billion bushels a spring wheat output of 600 million bushels 
would make a total us wheat harvest of about 22 billion bushels 
if wheat use in the 198990 marketing year which will begin 
june 1 totals in the range of 24 billion to 25 billion bushels 
this years harvest would fall short of meeting demand 
in that case leonard said in his letter to yeutter at least 
200 million bushels of wheat will have to be drawn from existing 
stocks which are estimated by the agriculture department to be 
drawn down to 549 million bushels by june 1 
thus he said the us wheat stockpile by june 1 1990 could 
well be down to around 300 million bushels according to department 
records that would be the the smallest us wheat reserve at the 
end of a marketing year since 1952 when it was 256 million bushels 
this is hardly adequate as a domestic reserve and will leave 
the us unable to intervene if famine conditions develop anywhere 
in the world leonard said the united nations food and 
agriculture organization a month ago said that world grain 
stocks will be drawn down again in 198990 for the third year in a 
row 
leonard added in effect fao does not expect food grain 
production to increase significantly in any of the major 
foodproducing areas outside the us 
the departments first official estimate of 1989 winter wheat 
production which usually accounts for threefourths of the us 
total will be released may 11 
meanwhile department analysts have used unofficial projections 
showing that the 1989 wheat harvest could be as low as 23 billion 
bushels or slightly more than leonards benchmark 
the biggest problem is in major areas of the great plains 
particularly in kansas the no 1 wheat producer where soils have 
been parched since the crop was planted last fall 
yeutter is scheduled to tour some of the kansas wheat area on 
friday his office said there has been congressional pressure on 
the department to extend 1988 drought relief to the stricken winter 
wheat farmers

a leading lawyer called wednesday for the supreme 
court to review a new law on subversion saying it may conflict 
with president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
the decree appears to be aimed in part at stopping nationalist 
unrest like that in the republic of georgia it bans premeditated 
acts aimed at inciting nationalist or racial animosity and actions 
aimed at undermining the soviet political and economic systems 
many dissidents have said the decree restricts freedom of speech 
and other human rights but the criticism by alexander m yakovlev 
was the first made publicly by a soviet lawyer 
yakovlev a department head at the institute of state and law 
made the remarks at a news conference and in an article published 
wednesday in the weekly newspaper moscow news 
he said that in general the decree was an improvement over 
earlier regulations banning antisoviet agitation and 
propaganda and antisoviet slander those rules have been 
used to jail dissidents 
however the lawyer said a section in the new rules on 
discrediting government bodies should be clarified 
the clause says publicly insulting or discrediting 
government or state bodies or officials can be punishable by up to 
three years in prison or a fine of up to 3200 
yakovlev said his institute part of the soviet academy of 
sciences had drafted the decree however he said it was surprised 
by the clause 
the regulation on insulting and discrediting was just as much 
news for us as for you he told reporters 
the lawyer said he did not know who inserted it into the decree 
which was approved saturday by the presidium or executive council 
of the supreme soviet the decree took effect monday and will be 
reviewed later by the full legislature which can make changes 
yakovlev said 
yakovlev suggested the discrediting rule might conflict with 
glasnost gorbachevs policy of openness because people should 
have the right to criticize their government 
yakovlev called for urgent authoritative clarification of 
the clause by the supreme court the court can overturn the decree 
and send it back for revision if it is deemed unconstitutional 
if an organ is discredited by true information that is 
revealed and objectively a loss of faith occurs as a result of 
unconstitutional illegal or criminal actions in that sense there 
can be no moral or criminal reproach yakovlev said 
another lawyer at the news conference felix m reshetnikov of 
the allunion research institute on soviet legislation said the 
decree should have banned only false accusations

the dropout rate for public school students has 
leveled off over the past few years according to statistics 
released wednesday 
figures from the board of education for the 198788 school year 
show the fouryear dropout rate for high school students was 268 
percent and the systemwide percentage was 297 
these are up slightly from the year before when the high school 
rate was 263 percent and the systemwide figure was 292 percent 
a separate study that followed individuals for their four years 
of high school ending in 1988 said 208 percent of the students had 
dropped out in 1987 this study said 224 percent of students quit 
schools chancellor richard green said more funding is needed for 
dropout prevention programs 
the studies use separate methodologies to determine the dropout 
rate the cohort report follows students for four years after they 
enter ninth grade and the annual dropout report analyzes the 
students who dropped out during 198788 
the annual dropout report also offers a racial and ethnic 
breakdown and showed that the dropout rate among hispanic students 
was significantly higher than the average

the united states has no compelling need for a 
commercially developed space platform proposed for use before a 
larger planned space station is put into orbit the national 
research council has concluded 
a report by the council released tuesday was based on a study 
by a panel of scientists and engineers 
its recommendations were counter to the proposal by the reagan 
administration for heavy federal support for the commercial space 
platform the national aeronautics and space administration had 
opposed the proposed venture as a possible competitor with its own 
space station to be put in orbit by 1996 
the report said there was no compelling need for a separate 
commercially developed facility for the conduct of research at low 
or zero gravity before then 
it said use of the space shuttle flights will accommodate the 
vast majority of anticipated experiments planned by nasa in the 
interim 
it said after the space station is built however construction 
of another facility for longterm microgravity experiments may 
well have merit if there are advances in microgravity research 
and space automation 
the report said the committee found no evidence to suggest 
that microgravity research would lead to significant spacebased 
manufacturing in the next five to 10 years 
the committee considers that microgravity science is at an 
immature stage due to lack of understanding of the fundamental 
processes involved in this area of space research the report 
said 
the reagan administrations 1988 space policy recommended 
support for an orbiting spacecraft for microgravity research which 
would be owned and operated by private business rather than nasa 
the federal government would be its main user however and would 
lease as much as 70 percent of the facility at a cost estimated at 
more than 700 million over five years 
the proposal for the private platform was developed by space 
industries inc of houston run by former nasa engineers and 
astronauts it said its space platform could be launched as early 
as 1992 
nasa requested the council study the scientific and commercial 
benefits of the proposal the council is an arm of the national 
academy of sciences

a document introduced at oliver norths 
irancontra trial strengthens the suggestion that thenvice 
president george bush knew honduras was being rewarded for its 
support of the nicaraguan rebels with additional us aid 
a national security council draft memo bears the handwritten 
notation we want vp to also discuss this matter with honduran 
president roberto suazo 
the handwriting in the margin of the feb 20 1985 document is 
next to a typewritten section of the memo detailing the quid pro 
quo arrangement 
bush had earlier warned against the possibility of such 
arrangements according to another document released earlier in 
norths trial the minutes of a june 25 1985 meeting of the 
national security planning group 
bush had said there could be a problem if the administration 
used us aid to entice third countries to aid the contras 
the congressional irancontra investigating committees looked 
into the possibility the administration had engaged in such 
arrangements but were unable to prove they existed 
asked about the new documents coming to light at norths trial 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said today that all 
the documents had been made available to the independent counsel 
prosecuting north for his review in the past 
it is up to the counsel to decide whether to turn them over to 
the investigating committees fitzwater said he said the white 
house was not investigating any of the matters 
a 42page summary of the reagan administrations quid pro quo 
arrangements with other countries on contra support was released 
last week 
it said bush met with suazo and told him about enhanced us aid 
shortly after the quid pro quo arrangement with honduras was made 
but the summary did not say whether bush knew the enhanced aid was 
in exchange for the central american countrys support of the 
contras

a house subcommittee on wednesday approved a 
bill to reorganize the consumer product safety commission and 
require studies reports and decisions affecting a variety of 
products ranging from cigarette lighters to reclining chairs 
the bill was sent to the energy and commerce committee by the on 
commerce consumer protection and competitiveness subcommittee on a 
voice vote after rejecting an amendment that would have renewed the 
commissions basic laws without change 
congress has been unable to agree on such a renewal since 1983 
and the commission has operated under automatic yeartoyear 
renewals granted by appropriations bills last year the parent 
committee approved a bill almost identical to the one passed by the 
subcommittee wednesday but it was too late in the session for the 
house to act 
among major changes that would be made by the bill is the 
designation of two members as a quorum when there are only three 
members although the commission is authorized to have five 
members congress in recent years has appropriated money for only 
three salaries and a current vacancy means the commission cannot 
act at all because the quorum requirement is now three 
the bill would require among other things 
a study of flammability standards for pajamas and nightgowns 
used by the elderly 
a study of age requirements for operating amusement park rides 
a survey of reclining chairs for compliance with existing 
standards 
a report to congress on what the commission is doing about 
indoor air pollution 
the adoption of a standard for lighters to protect children 
the bill would also give state attorneys general the same power 
as the commission has to bring suits in federal courts and would 
permit consumers to petition for safety rules with a 120day 
deadline for action on such petitions 
the bill is backed by major consumer organizations but opposed 
by major business groups 
the author of the defeated amendment for a straightforward 
renewal rep howard c nielson rutah said i dont think 
there is any evidence the commission is not doing its job and i am 
particularly alarmed at the budget increase the bill would 
authorize 
the bill would set a ceiling on appropriations of 39 million 
next year and 40 million the year after nielsons amendment would 
have set ceilings of 34 million and 35 million the bush 
administration has recommended an appropriation of 335 million 
down from 345 million this year 
deaths caused by products under the commissions jurisdiction 
have fallen from about 26000 in 1975 to 22000 in 1984 and the 
per capita decline has been more dramatic because the population 
has grown nielson said 
i dont think its fair to the commission to put so many 
things in it the bill they cant handle he said

president bush calling for definitive 
ethical standards in government today proposed tightening 
conflictofinterest rules through such restrictions as bans on 
honoraria for judges and on personal use of congressional campaign 
funds 
in a wideranging package covering activities by executive 
branch employees as well as judges and congress bush proposed 
changes in the campaign finance laws 
he said current law that allows lawmakers to convert campaign 
funds to personal use should be abandoned because leftover 
political donations should not become a kind of individual 
retirement account for members of congress 
the law now allows anyone who held office before 1980 to use 
leftover campaign contributions for any lawful purpose including 
personal use 
the president also called for elimination of campaign 
contributions by specialinterest political action committees 
weve allowed our parties to become weakened and overshadowed 
by special interests and i believe we should eliminate 
contributions to candidates by pacs he said 
his announcement today was an attempt to fulfill his pledge to 
bring higher ethical standards to government 
youre never going to legislate away impropriety bush said 
in a speech to the american society of newspaper editors convention 
where he announced the proposals but these values in ethics can 
be encouraged respected 
in a question session with the asne members bush said he still 
considers oliver north the former national security council aide 
a national hero because anybody that gets a purple heart sheds 
his blood fighting for his couuntry deserves to be called an 
american hero 
but he said the last thing i want to do is intervene in the 
ongoing case in which north is standing trial on charges he lied to 
congress and destroyed government documents in the irancontra case 
bush also said in answer to a question that the reason he is 
friendly and social with reporters is not to seduce them into 
favorable coverage 
were treating them as human beings i want to treat the 
press with the dignity to which it is entitled 
in a message to congress accompanying his ethics package the 
president said the proposals represent an effort to communicate 
definitive ethical standards to federal employees throughout our 
government 
bushs package included an executive order to cover executive 
branch employees and a legislative proposal to give judges a 25 
percent pay raise coupled with the honoraria ban for judges 
an honoraria ban already applies to executive branch officials 
and in his speech the president said he wants to extend it to 
congress however he did not include such a package in the 
largislative package saying he wanted to take it up at a future 
time in connection with a congressional pay raise 
bushs decision not to propose a congressional honoraria ban 
prompted criticism that he is letting congress off easy by not 
seeking to bar the speaking fees that enrich lawmakers 89500 
annual salaries 
fred wertheimer president of the civic action group common 
cause said bush caved in to pressure by members of congress who 
want to keep this corrupt system going he knows better and it 
appears the president doesnt have the courage of his convictions 
common cause supports a pay raise for congress and opposes all 
honoraria on the ground they promote excessive influence by the 
special interest groups that pay members of congress for speeches 
bushs commission on federal ethics law reform in its report 
march 10 endorsed a ban on honoraria for all three branches of 
government 
the president backed a 51 percent pay raise previously but 
congress itself voted against giving its members a raise this year 
while turning down the congressional honoraria recommendation 
bush is accepted a commission recommendation to bar members of 
congress members and senior personnel in the judicial and 
congressional branches who leave the government from lobbying their 
former offices for one year executive branch employees already are 
subject to such a ban 
the commission was created by bush to recommend changes in 
government ethics rules it reviewed matters such as outside 
income conflicts of interest financial disclosure and 
postemployment lobbying 
in the order covering the executive branch bush barred senior 
government officials from serving on the boards of profitmaking 
enterprises he proposed that the ban be extended to congressional 
and judicial officials as well 
the executive order also would give elevated rank to a 
designated ethics officer in each department and would do away 
with compartmentalization of the various agencies of the 
executive branch for purpose of lobbying after working for the 
government 
that means that executive branch workers currently barred for a 
year from lobbying their former office once they leave the 
government would be under the same restriction regarding all the 
departments of the executive branch 
fulltime presidential appointees white house employees and 
office of policy development employees also would be barred from 
receiving any outside income

the defense department has increased to more 
than 8100 the number of militarybase sites being surveyed for 
hazardous substances and pollution according to a report send to 
congress on wednesday 
actual cleanup work is going much more slowly however by the 
end of the past fiscal year the pentagon had projects under way at 
more than 1260 polluted sites 
the report covering the year ending last sept 30 cites the 
jump in sites undergoing preliminary surveys as a development that 
demonstrates a pentagon commitment to restoring polluted areas 
under military control 
the department of defense made significant progress during 
fiscal 1988 the report says 
it covers the efforts of pentagon agencies and the military 
services to comply with a section of the superfund law of 1986 that 
expanded the defense environmental restoration program 
that program received 404 million in fiscal 1988 
according to the report 8139 sites at 897 military 
installations had been identified for surveys by the end of the 
fiscal year to determine if a cleanup was needed the totals at the 
end of the previous year had been 5165 sites at 739 installations 
the pentagon attributed the jump to a desire to check 
primarily smaller installations such as national guard and 
reserve properties after it had completed reviews of large known 
problem areas around the country 
the report further discloses that more than 4400 sites have 
been moved into the next phase of the program in which a more 
indepth investigation is conducted and cleanup alternatives 
considered that work has been completed only at about 1500 of the 
sites however 
the third and final phase of the program actual cleanups is 
still moving at a relatively slow pace the report indicates as of 
the end of the fiscal year actual cleanup work and remedial 
actions had been completed at 216 polluted sites a net gain of 
90 compared to fiscal 1987 
cleanup work is under way at 1266 other sites the report 
states

a barge carrying the mammoth reactor 
vessel from the nations first commercial nuclear plant completed 
an 8000mile trip today to washington state where it will be 
buried at the hanford nuclear complex 
protesters hurled paint canisters and unfurled banners as the 
reactor vessel from the dismantled shippingport pa nuclear plant 
made its way up the columbia river in sixweek journey that took it 
through the panama canal 
the barge arrived at a dock on the edge of richland the reactor 
vessel will be trucked 25 miles to the burial trench where it will 
be entombed friday 
hanford the government nuclear weapons complex already is the 
final resting place for three nuclear submarine reactor cores 
the 1000ton reactor vessel 45 feet high and 18 feet across 
once held the uranium fuel that powered the nations first 
commercial nuclear plant which shut down in 1982 
the vessel was packed with concrete for the journey and 
officials said it poses no threat of radiation 
as the barge made its way up the columbia river gorge on 
tuesday 50 to 70 protesters on a bridge waved banners and signs 
and hurled canisters of lime green paint 
at least three small containers of paint were hurled from the 
bridge one struck the gray cover of the reactor vessel and two 
others hit the barge 
were trying to show that the local community in the gorge is 
not thrilled to be a nuclear highway said cyndi debruler of 
bingen an organizer of the demonstration 
earlier tuesday a fire broke out in the engine room of the 
tugboat pushing the barge causing a sevenhour delay but no 
injuries said wendy anderson of the company that owns the tug 
at no time was there any danger of the reactor vessel going 
aground she said 
but ms debruler said the fire showed the potential for danger 
if there were 60 mph winds and it was powerless it could lead 
to an accident she said 
the protesters said their main concern with the vessel is 
leakage into the river after it is buried

the white house declined to comment wednesday 
on a published report that japan has agreed to allow 40 percent of 
the work on a new coproduced jet fighter to be done in the united 
states 
the new york times citing an unidentified bush administration 
official said wednesday that japan has also eased its reluctance 
to share technology from the fsx fighter venture 
the newspaper said the concessions signaled that the deal would 
shortly be sent to congress where critics have said the project 
could amount to a us giveaway of muchneeded aircraft technology 
to japans aircraft industry 
asked about the status of the fsx negotiations with japan white 
house spokesman bill harlow said 
i dont have anything new on it as far as i know its still 
under discussion nothing is resolved at this point 
another us official who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified said he found the times story a little bit premature 
things are close but not quite there yet 
shingo yamagami press counselor at the japanese embassy also 
declined to comment on the times story he said us and japanese 
officials are still continuing their discussions about 
clarifications we havent reached any final conclusion yet 
the united states and japan reached an agreement in principle 
late last year under which st louisbased general dynamics would 
join with japans mitsubishi heavy industries to codevelop and 
coproduce a nextgeneration fighter for deployment by japan in 
the late 1990s 
the project to build the fsx which would be an advanced version 
of the f16 fighter has been stalled due to the bush 
administrations decision to obtain clarifications from the 
japanese 
proponents argue that the agreement represents the best the 
united states could negotiate in view of japanese opposition to 
buying americanmade f16s and will promote beneficial technology 
transfer in both directions while providing income and jobs for 
us companies 
critics however contend that the deal amounts to a giveaway of 
7 billion worth of technology that japan likely will use to help 
propel its aircraft industry into headtohead competition with the 
united states they say japan should instead purchase american 
planes to help offset the 50 billion us trade deficit with japan

librarians had no complaints four 100 bills fluttered out more 
than enough to pay the fine 
the books a bit shabby but its back home again librarian 
arden perkins said tuesday 
the book titled the folk song abecedary by james f leisy 
arrived at the library in a plain brown wrapper last week 
folded inside was a note from the anonymous borrower 
this book was removed from your library several years ago i 
am returning it with overdue fines and apologies the note said 
ms perkins said that based on the 5centperday fine the 
library levies for overdue books this one must have been checked 
out 22 years ago shortly after it was put on the shelves 
circulation records are not kept that long so the only clues to 
the whereabouts of the borrower is the postmark from de kalb ill 
and the book being wrapped in the de kalb chronicle 
ms perkins said the library only would have required the 
borrower to pay the value of a book plus 3 but will treat the 
400 as a gift

here is a transcript of president bushs 
remarks wednesday to the american society of newspaper editors 
bush thank you all very much applause 
john thank you 
please 
well im delighted to be here and look forward to taking a few 
questions 
ive been getting such a ribbing about my highly stylized prose 
i thought it only appropriate for me to share a few recent 
headlines with you laughter 
im sure nobody here would write things like this but 
scattered laughter dentist receives plaque that was one 
but laughs no laughter 
actor sent to jail for not finishing sentence laughter 
and the rest of the year may not follow january laughter 
im tempted to gloat 
if thats the standard im not doing too bad laughter 
adlai stevenson said an editor is a person who separates the 
wheat from the chaff and prints the chaff laughter 
so i know im probably responsible for providing my fair share 
of chaff but after all i am the guy that said during the 
campaign a kitchen in every pot laughter and also that 
americas freedom i was reminded by some of these back here 
americas freedom is the example by which the world expires 
so laughter let no one miss the message as editors you 
uphold a certain ethical standard in your newsrooms and youve got 
to do that because a newspaper is only as good as its word 
and i think this is no less true than government 
high ethical standards are central to this administration and 
were going to enforce them strictly comprehensively fairly and 
to the letter and spirit of the law 
and weve got to work together to reform a public code of 
conduct that at times appears to be in disarray 
and its not logical or fair code its both too harsh and too 
lenient and it elevates detail over substance precept over 
principle 
and so today i want to talk to you about some proposals of our 
administration because such a system as now constituted 
ultimately breeds cynicism and contempt for the law 
to truly reform it we must remember that standards of trust and 
honesty are not dictated from regulations written in washington 
dc 
ethics in public service derive from the natural integrity of 
the american people 
they are to be found in the everyday conduct of working men and 
women in the postman who checks out the checking up on the 
elderly resident at home or and the cashier who runs after the 
customer thats been overcharged 
the millions of americans who meet their obligations honestly 
and teach their kids to do it the same way see nothing 
extraordinary about asking the same of their government 
the american people are troubled when they hear of officials in 
every branch of government at whatever level of government who 
show a brazen contempt for the letter or spirit of the law 
and the american people do not understand why certain behavior 
is considered criminal when committed by an executive branch 
official or perfectly legal when committed by someone in another 
branch of government 
is not a crime a crime 
should there not be an underlying standard of integrity for all 
and as presidentelect i heard about talented men and women 
who though perfectly honest declined to declined to come to 
serve in government out of fear fear of the sheer complexity of 
federal ethics laws fear that a simple honest mistake could lead 
to a public nightmare 
and these concerns led me to issue an executive order creating 
the presidents commission on federal ethics law reform 
and i asked its members to recommend steps to foster full 
confidence in the integrity of all federal public officials and 
employees

congressional budget negotiators expressed 
confidence wednesday that agreement with the white house was near 
on a 28 billion deficit reduction plan for next year 
the parameters are there the outline of an agreement is 
there said sen jim sasser dtenn chairman of the senate 
budget committee 
the negotiating group which includes treasury secretary 
nicholas brady white house budget director richard darman and the 
senior members of the house and senate budget committees was 
checking its own ideas with people who would have to approve them 
when you do a budget there are a whole lot of numbers and 
agreements to put together in which you have to gain the complete 
cooperation of a lot of people in congress other than the 
negotiators so you have to run around and talk to all your 
friends on various committees said rep bill frenzel rminn 
senior republican on the house budget committee 
we have not hit anything that could be called a snag said 
rep thomas foley dwash the house majority leader 
in more than a month of talks the group has been searching for 
a compromise that would reduce the fiscal 1990 federal deficit by 
about 28 billion to comply with the grammrudman laws goal of 
limiting red ink to 100 billion 
about half of the savings would come from holding spending 
growth below inflation for military and many domestic programs and 
the other half from new revenues user fees sales of government 
assets and about 5 billion in new taxes 
president bushs budget included about the same amount of new 
revenues but mostly from his proposal to cut the tax rate on 
capital gains a lower tax rate on capital gains would actually 
yield additional revenue of 48 billion next year according to 
the administration 
congressional democrats oppose the capital gains plan as a break 
for the wealthy but the negotiators have agreed to include the 
overall tax figure in their plan in hopes that congress and the 
president can agree later on something that wont violate bushs 
no new taxes pledge 
the house republican study committee a group of conservative 
lawmakers on wednesday approved a resolution opposing any new 
taxes in the pact

cable television executives faced a buzz saw 
wednesday from congressional broadcast and consumer critics who 
said cable companies are reaping billions of dollars in profits at 
the publics expense 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio led the attack at a 
congressional hearing saying cable rates have risen an average of 
32 percent nationally since congress lifted virtually all 
regulations on cable operators in 1984 
the government reports that the price consumers pay for cable 
service increased at a greater rate than any other commodity or 
service in the entire united states said metzenbaum chairman of 
the senate judiciary subcommittee on antitrust monopolies and 
business rights 
metzenbaum said what little authority the federal communications 
commission has to regulate cable is a joke he introduced two 
bills that would allow city governments to regulate cable tv rates 
require that cable programmers make their shows available to 
competing services such as satellitedelivery and wireless 
cable and prohibit any one cable company from serving more than 
25 percent of cable subscribers nationwide 
edward o fritts president of the national association of 
broadcasters said the cable companies now dominate the local tv 
marketplace 
in 1984 when congress passed the cable act cable 
characterized itself as a struggling infant industry fritts 
said 
that act which in essence removed all regulatory oversight 
has become the communications equivalent of anabolic steroids 
today cable television operators enjoy an unregulated monopoly 
amazingly only 32 of more than 8000 cable systems have any direct 
competition 
fritts said cable tv now is a 14 billion industry that is 
available to nearly 80 million us homes 
gene kimmelman executive director of the consumer federation of 
america testified that competition in the cable marketplace could 
drive down prices by as much as 50 percent with a savings to 
consumers of 6 billion 
but gerald m levin vice chairman of time inc which owns home 
box office and cinemax strongly denied the monopoly label and 
said cable was providing more and better programming by owning 
both the program suppliers and cable systems 
levin also said cities reap billions of dollars in franchise 
fees from cable operators and municipalities are free to give 
those franchises to other companies if they dont like the existing 
cable serivce 
james mooney president of the national cable television 
association said pre1984 cable rates had been held artificially 
low by municipal regulation the industry incurred huge 
construction costs in the 1980s while the number of channels 
increased greatly 
the subcommittee is studying the cable industry and the 
antitrust implications of the proposed merger of time inc and 
warner communications the justice department last week gave the 
merger its blessing

after 20 days of arduous work and 
uncounted millions of dollars the worst effects of the nations 
biggest oil spill appear to be waning 
yet for all the work done by 1000 people on the water and 
shoreline and other thousands of support personnel much of the 
result is being attributed to the muscular forces of nature 
the natural processes have far outweighed ours jim hayden 
the states cleanup coordinator said earlier this week 
hayden and other officials acknowledge much of the easing 
situation must be credited to nature 
an estimated 30 to 40 percent of the 101 million gallons of 
oil that poured from the tanker exxon valdez has been dissipated by 
natural evaporation of the more volatile components of the crude 
oil by thursday less than 20000 barrels under 10 percent of the 
spill will have been recovered by human effort 
favorable weather through most of the 20 days since the spill 
pushed vast amounts of the oil out of prince william sound and into 
the gulf of alaska where several days of high wind and heavy seas 
churned and broke up the slick 
aerial observations this week indicated that some blackened 
beaches on the islands and inlets of the sound are being cleansed 
by the heavy wave action 
the spills disastrous effects are far from over it is feared 
the toll of wildlife will continue and even grow as migrating birds 
return to the oiled beaches 
it will be years before scientists know the impact on the vast 
ecosystem in prince william sound 
yet scientists are warning that nature must be given a big share 
of the cleanup work that remains they say too much human labor and 
technology applied to oiled areas could do more harm than good 
weve seen from other spills that if we hit an area too hard 
with things like high pressure water or heavy equipment we wind up 
killing everything said john robinson chief of the hazardous 
material response branch of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
robinson said much of the shoreline hit by the oil is of a rock 
and gravel mix if efforts to clean the beaches are too vigorous 
he said it could force the oil deep into the ground where it can 
affect microscopic life valuable to the areas ecosystem 
robinson said the publics anxiety to clean the remaining mess 
as quickly as possible must be balanced with the realization that 
some areas would be better left to a slower cleanup job by nature 
im optimistic that the officials here understand that he 
said i would hope that the public doesnt get frustrated with 
what might seem like a slow process and not press us into doing it 
too fast

rulla abdo dihu sat on the steps of the 
prison exercise yard wednesday and said with chilling conviction 
that she would take up arms again if she were freed 
i didnt kill for myself im not a criminal im a political 
prisoner what i did i did for my people the palestinian 
christian told a reporter during a tour of the security wing of tel 
monde prison in central israel 
ms dihu 20 from the west bank town of ramallah was sentenced 
in january 1988 to 25 years jail for getting a gun that another 
palestinian used to kill an israeli soldier 
asked if she regretted her act ms dihu responded in a voice 
choked with emotion why should i be we are fighting for our 
justice we are at war alls fair in love and war 
i would love to go back to fighting with my people in the 
intefadeh she said using the arabic word for the uprising 
against israeli rule in the occupied territories 
she is one of 24 palestinian women transferred to a segregated 
wing here after the rebellion spilled over to the central womens 
prison at neve tirza 
the tensions resulted in hairpulling battles between israeli 
criminals and arab political detainees 
they beat up one of the palestinian women and shouted curses 
against the plo and our leaders said terry boulatta 22 of 
jerusalem who awaits trial on charges of organizing antiisraeli 
demonstrations march 8 
the political activism of arab women is a change in traditional 
lifestyle that has grown out of the uprising as thousands of 
palestinian men have been arrested or wounded women and children 
have taken their places at the forefront of street protests 
israeli officials refuse to say how many women are behind bars 
during the tour palestinian women complained of rodent 
excrement in food mosquitoes in cells and lack of medical 
attention 
they live two to a cell in a twostory wing with a central 
courtyard open to the sky childrens paintings of an arab village 
and a field of flowers remain from the facilitys days as a 
juvenile center 
ms boulatta who has been jailed four times for political 
activism complained she receives no medical help for a liver 
dysfunction diagnosed by arab doctors 
she said a doctor visits the prisons for a half hour three times 
a week they only look at me and say youre okay and go back to 
your room 
prison physician dr victor romanov said an israeli specialist 
examined and tested ms boulatta but found nothing wrong 
some complaints about food and conditions seemed exaggerated 
prison commissioner levy shaul rejected them 
he called tel monde a model prison but conceded overcrowding and 
poor standards plague other facilities where antiisraeli activists 
are held 
overcrowding is such that in some facilities prisoners have to 
stand in line for a bathroom he said 
shaul noted women in tel monde are allowed family visits and 
have access to radio television newspapers and some nonpolitical 
books 
israeli authorities have refused requests from reporters to 
visit other prisons especially the ketziot detention center in the 
negev desert where several thousand arab activists are living in 
tents exposed to searing desert winds and heat most are held 
without trial for up to six months

a federal appeals court refused wednesday 
to reinstate a businessmans 250000 libel award against the 
soviet newspaper izvestia saying a foreign government publication 
cannot be sued for libel 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals also overturned 163165 
in breachofcontract damages for raphael gregorian of palo alto 
against soviet trade organizations despite initially refusing to 
appear in court on the advice of their government the 
organizations should have a chance to contest gregorians claims 
the court said 
gregorians california international trade corp had sold 
medical and laboratory products to the soviet union since 1970 
gregorian said the government and two trading organizations 
medexport and licensintorg accepted and used hospital equipment in 
1984 but failed to pay for it 
in november 1984 the soviet ministry of foreign trade withdrew 
the companys license to maintain a business office in the soviet 
union the following week an article in izvestia accused gregorian 
of smuggling bribery and unethical business practices and implied 
he had been spying for the united states the court said 
gregorians lawsuit contended the newspaper article and the loss 
of his license were attempts to avoid payment for the hospital 
equipment 
when soviet officials refused to respond to the lawsuit us 
district judge david kenyon found them in default and awarded 
damages gregorian then seized a typewriter belonging to a us 
correspondent for izvestia and got an order allowing him to 
confiscate money in a us bank account held by a soviet agency 
kenyon later overturned the libel judgment wednesdays 30 
ruling upheld that decision and ordered him to reconsider the 
contract claim

a retired australian sheep shearer who 
inherited the title of earl of lincoln toured his namesake city 
wednesday but even the prospect of sitting in the house of lords 
wasnt enough to make him stay 
its a splendid place but we will be going back to 
australia edward fiennesclinton 75 said after he and his wife 
linda the new countess of lincoln visited lincolns castle 
cathedral and prosperous shopping malls 
fiennesclinton who also worked as a gold miner and milk 
deliveryman said they decided to return home thursday after 
discovering there is no ancestral home to go with the title only 
a seat in the hereditary house of lords 
this wont change our lives we are still the same people and 
i hope its not going to change me at all said the earl who 
calls his wife mum 
he was telephoned in january at his retirement village in 
bunbury near perth australia and asked to call the college of 
arms in london 
i had no idea what it was all about but i spoke to a man who 
said he would be the first to congratulate me said the 18th earl 
of lincoln 
i knew the title was in the family but there are so many 
different branches it never occurred to me that i might inherit it 
it is an old and honorable title and i would like to carry it on in 
the few years left to me fiennesclinton inherited the 
16thcentury title on christmas day upon the death in england of a 
remote kinsman the 10th duke of newcastle and earl of lincoln the 
family had fallen on hard times and the duke was chiefly known as 
a collector of butterflies and moths 
the old family seat clumber in nottinghamshire was pulled down 
as long ago as 1938 and its 3800acre park is now owned by the 
national trust which cares for historic homes 
as the duke was unmarried the dukedom became extinct but the 
lesser title of the lincoln earldom passed to the australian whose 
forebears had emigrated 
the earl said he gave up fulltime work 13 years ago and does 
not have the resources or desire to move to england the only cash 
benefit available to him would be a maximum payment of 57 pounds 
97 daily if he attended the house of lords and had to stay in 
london overnight 
we had some very nice letters from the city council assuring 
us of a warm welcome if we ever visited lincoln so we came over to 
see it and to look into this title business the earl said 
the earls only previous visit to britain was in 1977 for the 
silver jubilee to mark queen elizabeth iis 25 years on the throne 
he never thought of visiting lincoln at that time 
i grew up in the depression in australia and there was no dole 
welfare my first job was as a butcher earning 10 shillings 2 
a week we used to kill out in the paddock and hang up the carcass 
in a tree the earl said 
he said he never found a crock of gold in his prospecting but 
before he retired he was running the water supply for a large part 
of the country 
the earl said i was a widower when we were married and mum 
was a widow i have been lucky both times he said he would like 
to take up his house of lords seat but there was little prospect 
of it 
the college of arms said it could be five or six months before 
the necessary research was completed the cost of confirming the 
title to make it legal and securing recognition by the queen could 
be 8500 
mum and i are registered in the house of lords but it is not 
all legal until the research has been done the earl said

and on march 9 as you may remember this commission filed its 
report and its recommendation 
it was chaired by ambassador wilkey judge wilkey cochaired by 
former attorney general griffin bell 
in fact the legislation now resulting from their 
recommendations and other ideas that i have legislation is being 
sent to the congress today 
and just this morning i issued an executive order announcing 
ethical principles for the conduct of executive branch employees 
both actions seek a common end to raise ethical standards to 
avoid conflicts of interest and to ensure that the law is 
respected in fact and in appearance 
there are those of course who say that public ethics and values 
cannot be legislated 
but they can and im inclined to agree youre never going to 
legislate away impropriety or through legislation guarantee that 
everybody everybody lives beyond the you know perception of 
criticism 
but these values and ethics can be encouraged respected and 
adhered to in government 
public service must reflect the best values of america and let 
me add that most public servants in my view do that and i have 
served in the congress and i have served in the executive branch as 
well 
jefferson said the whole art of government consists in being 
honest 
and yet too often simple honesty is not enough 
government rules have worked at cross purposes 
our regulations have been complicated and unequally applied 
our laws have been contradictory and unclear and weve spent 
more time trying to understand federal ethics laws than we have 
trying to live by them 
my ethics program seeks to remedy these defects 
how 
by setting four objectives 
first to establish clear ethical principles 
second to ensure uniform standards among all three branches of 
government 
third to insist that these standards be fair and reasonable 
and fourth to ensure that these standards attract not drive 
out talented men and women to government 
my ethics program first insists that ethical standards must be 
exacting enough to ensure that officials act with the utmost 
integrity for the publics confidence is not ours to inherit 
we must earn that confidence and it must be constantly renewed 
with this in mind i have placed a ban on outside income for 
noncareer presidential appointees in the executive branch 
including all employees in the immediate white house office 
i am proposing expanded financial disclosure for all three 
branches of government and i have instructed my staff to perform a 
comprehensive review of federal campaign finance laws 
regarding the last and i have already reached one 
determination congress should extend for all members the 
prohibition against the conversion of political contributions for 
personal or office use 
political donations should not become a sort of individual 
retirement account for members of the united states congress and i 
call on congress to close this loophole and to close it this year 
modern democratic government works best when organized by strong 
political parties and yet we have allowed our parties to become 
weakened and overshadowed by special interests and we can best 
restore the role of the parties by limiting political action 
committees 
pacs weaken the parties restrain competition and deaden the 
political debate 
and i believe we should eliminate contributions to candidates by 
political action committees and ill be consulting with the 
congress about that and i also oppose federal funding of 
congressional campaigns

morton downey jr got outshouted and didnt 
smoke a single cigarette geraldo rivera went nosetonose 
unbloodied this time and phil donahue who once wore a dress for a 
show on transvestites didnt skirt the issue 
and larry king who doesnt like the kinky stuff defended 
them all 
the occasion was a raucous oftenhilarious 90minute program 
wednesday pitting the four talkshow hosts and other television 
luminaries against leaders in the print media over what constitutes 
news good taste and responsible journalism nobody not even 
downey a selfadmitted yeller seemed to have the last word 
king took a stab at it its a big pie said the usa today 
columnist and mutal radio and cnn television talkshow host 
geraldos producers may decide they want to do a lot of sex on 
their programs or they want to do things that may be kinky 
suppose they do that so what 
i dont have to watch king said we each set out to do 
our programs same with newspapers theres the new york daily news 
and the new york times and the new york post and the wichita paper 
and usa today and all the americans have is choice 
the program produced by columbia university at the opening 
session of the american society of newspaper editors annual 
convention was videotaped and will be aired wednesday night and on 
subsequent dates by public television stations it was moderated by 
former cbs news chief fred w friendly now with columbias 
graduate school of journalism 
friendly started the fireworks by showing an excerpt from a 
program rivera did on sex surrogates and telling his former 
student it seems to me that what youre concentrating on is that 
kinky business 
rivera i do lots of different programs you are talking 
about 10 percent of what i do 
friendly mr rivera i looked at a hundred of your programs 
i could have run a hundred of them and made the same point 
what are you mr rivera friendly persisted 
im a compassionate man a television talkshow host a 
reporter a journalist a writer said rivera 
q who are your role models 
a theres a lot of walter winchell in what i do theres 
also edward r murrow and merv griffin 
friendly thats a combination winchell griffin and murrow 
jack nelson washington bureau chief of the los angeles times 
snapped that rivera and the others are more show biz than you are 
journalists 
rivera shot back this is arrogant this is hypocrisy 
he demanded to know how much of the criticism of socalled trash 
television is based on pure parochialism how much of it is based 
on the fact that i am your competition 
nelson i dont think youre a journalist 
donohue explain the difference 
nelson well i go out and i try to find out what i can that i 
think is important for society to know for society to act on 
downey youre a snob 
tom shales television critic for the washington post said 
were not talking about whats journalism and whats not 
journalism were talking about whats good taste and whats bad 
taste whats good manners and whats bad manners and i think 
television now is overrun with bad taste and bad manners 
the audience was shown another excerpt from downeys program 
in which a young member of the audience challenged the hosts views 
on prison furloughs by noting that one of the central tenets of 
christianity is foregiveness 
downey was shown retorting 
let me tell you something more people have been killed in the 
name of jesus theyve all been killed by guys like you 
downey and the young man wound up screaming murderer at one 
another 10 times over downey concluded the segment by raising his 
arm and inviting the youth to suck my armpit 
friendly did you really give that young man a chance to be 
heard 
downey absolutely what am i supposed to do write bland 
headlines on the 17th page of a newspaper 
downey said he is an advocate not a host i was raised in 
the generation of rock n roll and we heard the lyrics over the 
music the older folks here dont seem to be able to hear the 
lyrics 
nelson said the most reprehensible thing i see on any of these 
programs is mort downey smoking his cigarette on television 
downey who couldnt smoke during the asne appearance because of 
rules governing the hall replied thats the mentality of the 
superliberal 
king if morton downey wishes to commit suicide that is his 
prerogative 
downey to nelson youd love for me to drop dead because it 
would be sensational for your newspaper 
the capacity audience of about 500 newspaper publishers and 
executives also viewed the donahue segment in which he donned a 
dress for a show on transvestites 
friendly taunted him about that noting he once admired donahue 
for the way he handled shows people have come to see you as a 
role model and now youre making a fool of yourself said 
friendly 
donahue replied that i do not apologize for wanting to draw a 
crowd im as interested in ratings as the people in the room are 
interested in circulation 
besides said donahue i think its a pretty good epitaph for 
somebody occasionally he went too far 
toward the end virtually all the panelists were trying to be 
heard over each other i find it extremely distasteful said 
downey to listen to shouting 
friendly in a notsoveiled reference to a geraldo episode 
said i cant break peoples noses to stop them

a british professor on wednesday presented 
more details of an experiment he said produced nuclear fusion but 
many scientists at an international conference said they were 
skeptical 
the scientists said that even if fusion had been achieved there 
were no guarantees it would provide a revolutionary new energy 
source 
im warning people dont sell your oil well yet said 
physicist steven jones of brigham young university in utah 
about 100 scientists from around the world gathered wednesday at 
the ettore majorana center for scientific culture in sicily to 
listen to british professor martin fleischmann and to jones who 
says he also achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature using 
ordinary laboratory equipment 
fleishchmann of the university of southampton said when an 
electrical current was used to herd hydrogen atoms into metal 
electrodes in a glass beaker the atoms apparently fused 
generating four watts of energy for every watt used 
in london nature magazine announced wednesday it will publish 
at least one of two research papers by scientists who claim to have 
independently generated nuclear fusion publication date was set 
for april 27 according to laura garwin an editor 
for decades scientists have spent millions of dollars searching 
for a practical way to achieve nuclear fusion because of its 
potential as an inexpensive relatively clean and virtually 
inexhaustible source of energy 
if scientists could harness fusion power an ounce of heavy 
hydrogen could generate the energy equivalent of 70000 gallons of 
gasoline jones said 
in the three weeks since fleischmann and fellow researcher b 
stanley pons of the university of utah made their fusion 
announcement hundreds of scientists have rushed to duplicate the 
experiments several us universities reported partial results 
im somewhat disappointed and worried that in the past two 
weeks no one has solidly confirmed it said matthijs broer a 
physicist at american telephone and telegraph co bell laboratories 
in murray hill nj 
jones and the team of fleischmann and pons detailed their 
experiments wednesday as scientists from the united states europe 
the soviet union and china peppered them with highly technical 
questions 
several scientists qestioned fleischmanns and pons claim that 
their fusion process produced four times as much energy as it used 
i dont think the heat they see is due to fusion said 
jones who announced last month he had independently created cold 
nuclear fusion but produced only a miniscule energy release 
physicists said the fleischmannpons experiment might have been 
simply a chemical reaction and therefore not significant as an 
energy source 
fleischmann however said that only nuclear activity could 
account for the amount of energy released 
scientists also questioned whether fleischmann and pons checked 
all the variables in their experiment fleischmann refused to 
answer several questions 
fleischmann acknowledged that more experiments were needed but 
said he was not concerned that his work had not been matched i 
dont see how people can expect to duplicate the results in a short 
time he said 
nonetheless physicists said they were taking the experiments 
seriously because of their potentially farreaching impact and 
because of the scientists solid reputations 
fusion is the process by which tremendous amounts of energy are 
released when the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse 
in contrast nuclear power plants get energy from fission or 
the splitting of atoms 
standard fusion experiments have used extremely high 
temperatures and machines the size of twostory homes to force the 
hydrogen atoms to fuse 
steven koonin a theoretical nuclear physicist from california 
said if the discoveries were true they could bring bad as well as 
good developments 
if you can do nuclear physics in your kitchen you have a 
severe proliferation problem he said

a congressional commission on wednesday 
recommended a permanent office in the federal health department to 
coordinate fights against socalled orphan diseases that afflict an 
estimated 20 million americans 
orphan diseases are relatively rare ailments that by 
definition affect no more than 200000 people 
but because there are so many separate diseases the total 
number of people suffering from them is larger than from many 
betterknown ailments 
some diseases that qualify for orphan status are fairly 
wellknown themselves such as autism multiple schlerosis and 
taysachs diseases 
some such as cholera are common in the third world but rare 
in the united states 
still others are obscure such as wilsons disease a hereditary 
illness that causes liver and brain damage 
the final report of the national commission on orphan diseases 
established by congress in 1985 called for creation of a central 
office of orphan and rare diseases to be known as coord within 
the department of health and human services 
it would work to 
increase financing for biomedical research training 
fellowships and clinical research centers 
provide access to affordable health care for all american and 
eliminate health insurance restrictions on preexisting conditions 
speed the government approval process for medications designed 
to help sufferers of rare diseases 
create a centralized information datebase on rare diseases 
research is critical and we must make it clear to doctors and 
investigators that the tratment of rare diseases is a national 
priority said dr jess g thoene chairman of the commission 
he was joined at a news conference by sen orrin hatch rutah 
and rep henry a waxman dcalif main backers of the legislation 
that created the commission 
both also were instrumental in passage of th orphan drug act a 
companion law that provides tax breaks for drug companies who make 
research investments to develop drugs for such a small patient base 
there is not a large enough market to justify the effort otherwise 
hatch said the success of the act has been staggering and 
has accomplished mroe than congress ever expected it to 
waxman said more than 260 drugs have been developed for rare 
diseases since the orphan drug act took effect compared to less 
than a dozen prior to the legislation

the new england states are likely this summer 
to face a repeat of last years temporary electricity shortages 
and the squeeze may be a prelude to more widespread brownouts 
in the 1990s energy analysts said wednesday 
what happens in the northeast will be a harbinger for the rest 
of the country said leonard j kujawa an arthur andersen amp co 
analyst who helped direct a study on electric power trends in the 
united states 
although electricity supplies for the peak use periods of summer 
are tightest in new england the power outlook for the nation as a 
whole is growing more uncertain said daniel yergin president of 
cambridge energy research associates and a partner in the study 
the central problem is that us electricity demand has grown 
more rapidly than expected since 1985 while utilities have chosen 
not to add to their generating capacity kujawa and yergin told a 
news conference on the results of their study 
the key question they said is who will build the generating 
capacity that will be needed in the 1990s the answer is uncertain 
because utilities are wary of the financial risks involved in major 
new additions to plant capacity while smaller power producers face 
an array of regulatory and other obstacles they said 
in the northeast utilities in recent years have been forced to 
import power from the midatlantic last summer the problem was 
compounded by record heat in the boston area several thousand 
customers lost power for a weekend because of overheated 
transmission cables and in new york city about 10000 customers 
lost power for a day 
other parts of the country have excess generating capacity but 
if demand for electricity continues growing at the pace of recent 
years constraints on supply could be felt in many areas the 
analysts said 
environmental and regulatory issues also may compound the 
problem they said 
what is missing is an overall framework for balancing needs 
for new generating capacity with environmental concerns and the 
questions about who will pay said yergin

sovietborn conductor mstislav rostropovich 
tearfully hailing a new era of artistic freedom in his homeland 
announced wednesday he will return to the soviet union for a 
concert tour with the national symphony orchestra next february 
it will be his first visit to the soviet union except for a 
brief unnoticed stopover in the moscow airport a few years ago 
since he fled into exile with his wife soprano galina 
vishnevskaya in 1974 they were stripped of their soviet 
citizenship four years later 
rostropovich 62 a worldrenowned cellist who has been music 
director of the national symphony since 1977 told reporters at the 
kennedy center he was very excited and very nervous about 
visiting the homeland where he formerly was reviled and harassed by 
soviet authorities 
he and soviet ambassador yuri dubinin tears streaming down 
their faces embraced after the news conference dubinin hinted 
broadly that if rostropovich gave a signal the kremlin would be 
willing to initiate the process of restoring his soviet citizenship 
but rostropovich carefully avoided giving any indication of his 
future intentions choosing instead to lavish praise on soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reform policies 
the soviet people have so much more freedom so much more 
glasnost than before mr gorbachev he said for artistic 
freedom there has been enormous change 
rostropovich acknowledged that he had once vowed never to return 
to his homeland until there were major changes in the soviet 
system but he said wednesday that gorbachevs farreaching reforms 
give me the moral right to go there 
after the national symphony completes a twoweek tour of japan 
in late january and early february rostropovich and the 103member 
orchestra will fly to the soviet union for two concerts in moscow 
and two in leningrad in about a week 
although the concert programs for the soviet tour were 
undecided rostropovich said his first choices were antonin 
dvoraks double concerto for cello and orchestra with himself at 
the cello and dmitri shostakovichs fifth symphony a powerful 
musical denunciation of the political and human rights abuses of 
the stalin era 
it was unclear wednesday whether rostropovichs wife would join 
the soviet tour 
dubinin said the tour will be a very very important page for 
his biography for development of cultural exchanges and for 
deep changes in our society and our relations with the united 
states 
the ambassador said the issue of restoring rostropovichs 
citizenship was a special question which depends now on the 
will of maestro rostropovich whether to begin the procedure 
dubinin added lets hope the time will come when all the 
legal decisions will be taken according to the wishes of maestro 
rostropovich 
stephen klein the orchestras executive director said it was 
only on monday that he received the formal invitation from 
gosconcert the soviet performing arts agency for the national 
symphony to make the tour 
although such a trip had been rumored for months the orchestra 
players were not given the official news until rostropovich mounted 
the podium in the kennedy center concert hall for their regular 
wednesday morning rehearsal 
klein said he considered it highly unlikely that rostropovich 
would seek to regain his soviet citizenship and to return home 
permanently leaving his lucrative job at the national symphony 
his concert recitals and recording commitments 
in an emotional speech to orchestra members klein said 
rostropovich noted that many of his soviet contemporaries 
including shostakovich pianist emil gilels and violinist david 
oistrakh had died he told his musicians that you have become 
my family 
rostropovichs troubles with soviet authorities began when and 
his wife took soviet author alexander solzhenitsyn into their home 
after the 1970 nobel prize winner was kicked out of the soviet 
writers union and deprived of his apartment 
the couples concerts and foreign tours were canceled all 
recording sessions were halted and they suffered a total blackout 
in the soviet press after sen edward m kennedy dmass 
intervened with soviet leader leonid brezhnev the couple obtained 
exit visas fled to the west in 1974 and decided to stay 
rostropovichs rehabilitation began in 1987 when soviet 
authorities allowed his sister veronika to fly to washington to 
attend festivities marking the conductors 60th birthday 
in january the government newspaper izvestia urged restoration 
of the couples citizenship and a senior member of the soviet 
foreign ministry said in february that authorities would review the 
cases of people stripped of their citizenship last month a 
favorable documentary on rostropovich and his wife was broadcast on 
soviet television

my legislative proposal also strengthens the rules against 
abusing the revolving door for private gain at the expense of 
public trust 
these rules must not make government service a bar to productive 
work in the private sector but they must prohibit the appearance 
of profiting from government service and this must include the 
legislative branch as well 
i am proposing a 25 percent pay raise for federal judges while 
restricting their acceptance of honoraria 
i also believe that honoraria for members of congress should be 
banned 
and i believe congress should have a pay increase 
and i will not make a formal proposal on congress until after i 
consult with the leaders of congress on the issue of congressional 
pay 
there is no point absolutely no point in putting congress 
through another traumatic bashing like the one just completed 
and i will include in those consultations the question of a 
pay increase for certain executive branch positions including 
specialized jobs like those out there at the national institutes of 
health 
and i will strongly support pay increases for these jobs which 
are so important to this country 
my ethics programs second goal recognizes that ethical 
consistency demands equitable standards across all three branches 
of government 
and under our constitution every branch of government is equal 
and none warrants preferential treatment 
the same standard that applies to a staff person at hud 
department of housing and urban development should also apply to 
housing subcommittee staff on capitol hill 
and a practice is either ethical or it is not 
and if washington is to be a level playing field then every 
player should be treated the same 
and therefore i am proposing that we must extend the independent 
counsel statute to cover the congress 
i am also proposing that the federal statute that prohibits 
employees from taking actions that enhance their own financial 
interest be extended to cover legislative and judicial branch 
employees 
there should also be an independent ethics office for congress 
to be headed by a clearly nonpartisan official confirmed by both 
houses 
and i ask that the existing oneyear postemployment cooling 
off period for the senior executive branch employees also apply 
to the legislative and the judicial branch 
and then theres the third objective of this ethics program 
it insists that standards be reasonable and reflect good 
oldfashioned common sense 
some financial interests for example are too minor to create 
any meaningful conflict of interest at all 
so i want the office of government ethics to have the authority 
to issue regulations authorizing waivers from these conflict of 
interest statutes 
but at the same time were urging tougher penalties when 
intentional violations of criminal conflict of interest laws occur 
were asking officials from all three branches to simplify the 
forms that must be completed by prospective appointees and im 
also requiring mandatory annual briefings on ethics for 
presidential appointees

a roman catholic newspaper wednesday 
criticized jewish demands to relocate a carmelite convent away from 
the former auschwitz concentration camp 
the roman catholic hierarchy has agreed to move the convent but 
its failure to meet a promised feb 22 deadline has provoked an 
outcry from jewish organizations 
the newspaper slowo powszechne published an open letter from 
1375 people from oswiecim protesting the pressure on the nuns to 
leave the building they occupy oswiecim is the polish name for 
the city the germans called auschwitz 
the newspaper does not represent the catholic church it is 
owned by a catholic progovernment organization called pax 
jews want the convent moved because auschwitz now a museum 
holds special significance for them about 28 million of the 6 
million jews killed in the nazi holocaust died at auschwitz 
factorylike gas chambers and crematoria and those of birkenau a 
larger death camp a mile away that shared the same nazi 
administration victims came from throughout europe 
ernst ludwig ehrlich european director of bnai brith said 
jewish relations with the catholic church will remain frozen 
until the convent is moved 
in a telephone interview from his home in geneva ehrlich cited 
resistance by the catholic rank and file and others in all of 
poland 
he said he doubts polish assurances that a start will be made 
soon to build a new home for the convents 14 nuns 
slowo powszechne questioned any decision to move the convent in 
a former theater used as a warehouse by the nazis and located a few 
yards outside the camps barbed wire fence 
in the auschwitz camp it was mainly nonjews who were 
murdered above all polish and pows of other nationalities and the 
extermination of jews was being conducted in birkenau the paper 
said in a march 31 article 
therefore it is hard to understand why people of a different 
nationality and citizenship declare themselves so fiercely against 
a handful of nuns living in a polish city on polish soil next to 
one of the biggest sites of martyrdom of poles the article said 
more than 4 million people were put to death at the 
auschwitzbirkenau complex

the european economic community continues to 
push grain exports aggressively with shipments expected to be at a 
record level this year the agriculture department said wednesday 
an analysis by the departments foreign agricultural service 
said eec exports of wheat and coarse grains such as barley and corn 
are expected to total 333 million metric tons in 198889 up 39 
percent from 239 million tons last year 
international trade years begin on july 1 for wheat and oct 1 
for coarse grains a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal 
to 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans or 395 bushels of corn 
wheat exports by the eec are at a record 21 million tons up 
from 153 million in 198788 
but the coarse grains mostly barley also have grown and are 
forecast at 123 million tons against only 86 million tons last 
year 
over the past seven years subsidized barley exports by the 
eec have jumped by 150 percent the report said while eec 
barley exports comprised less than 30 percent of world barley trade 
as recently as the early 1980s their share is now almost 60 
percent a growth in exports that has come at least partially at 
the expense of us coarse grain market share 
the united states the worlds leading grain exporter was 
forecast to have total wheat and coarse grain shipments of 1034 
million tons in the current trade year up from 969 million tons 
in 198788 a 7 percent increase 
part of the growth reflects recent large corn sales to the 
soviet union and subsidized wheat sales to china 
the soviet union is expected to import 375 million tons of 
wheat and coarse grains from all sources this year up 2 million 
tons from the march forecast and 16 percent more than the 322 
million tons imported in 198788 it also would be the most wheat 
and coarse grains imported by the soviets since 554 million tons 
were bought in 198485 
according to other usda figures the soviets have bought about 
17 million tons of us wheat and corn for delivery in the year 
that began oct 1 all but 4 million tons of it corn 
china has bought about 85 million tons of us wheat for 
delivery this year about half of the 165 million tons china is 
expected to import from all sources in 198889

my programs fourth objective is to attract and keep the best 
people in government by keeping federal ethics laws fair and 
balanced 
an ethics law is not a weapon a blunt instrument with which to 
pound a public servant 
its not a gag with which to silence the outspoken 
its a tool to ensure a government as honest as the american 
people 
we must not allow overly restrictive requirements to be abused 
or to keep talented people from entering public service 
and that is why we have carefully crafted new postemployment 
restrictions and thats why we want to allow persons who are 
required to divest assets to defer their tax liability 
my ethics program shows exactly where we are going and why we 
seek to attract and keep the best and brightest in government 
and by helping others by building a better america honorably 
ethically we seek to show how public service is not the sum of our 
perks or possessions but a measure of how we conduct ourselves and 
what we achieve 
come to think of it this is a good code for all occupations 
from high school to the highest callings in journalism and 
government 
i am delighted to have the opportunity to present to you the 
principles of this ethics package 
and obviously i dont want to see this powerful crowd escape 
without a pitch 
id like to have your editorial support for the objectives that 
ive outlined here today 
thank you all very much and id be glad to take your questions 
applause 
john seigenthaler the standard is that members of the society 
only are permitted to ask questions those who are asking questions 
will identify themselves by name and their news agency ben johnson 
q ben johnson columbia missourian columbia mo mr 
president my daughter thanks you for the autograph you gave us 
last week and im asking this question on her behalf she is a 
12yearold sixthgrader and im a little nervous here 12year 
old sixthgrader at shepard elementary school and she asked me 
after i left the white house daddy will i ever be president 
would i have a chance to be president like mr bush shes black 
and also female do you envision sir a time when this country 
might be prepared to elect a black andor female as president 
bush yes i do 
id say to her if i can make it she can make it 
but nevertheless laughter no but seriously ben of course 
were in changing times here 
and the great thing is that she might by her question aspire 
to be president 
and i hope that i can keep alive for at least the time im in 
the white house the concept the honor of public service the 
obligation to put something back into the system and also the fact 
that if you get into the arena you get a very different perspective 
than when youre sitting outside 
i always loved what sam rayburn said and this is a little off 
your question for your daughter but he was listening to some 
debate with a bunch of staffers i think it was up on the hill 
he said well the problem is i never ran for sheriff 
and it makes a difference 
so i hope that the question means she is interested and i hope 
that the progress that this country has made and will make in the 
future will guarantee that a black teenager today female might 
well be president of the united states

a mysterious disease is striking infant pigs 
on some indiana farms and in some cases 100 percent of the 
infected weakened litters have died 
eight hog operations in wabash county have been hit by the 
disease said farmer dean haupert whose farm was stricken 
we probably lost 30 litters haupert said were spending 
a couple of thousand dollars a week on medication 
purdue university scientists said other isolated cases have been 
recorded across the state 
at this stage no one knows exactly what the disease is said 
kenneth b meyer professor of veterinary adult education at purdue 
the illness strikes sows with a loss of appetite during the 
latter part of their 113day gestation period some farrows or 
litters are stillborn the survivors have weakened heart membranes 
and cardiac muscles and a short life expectancy 
in some hog operations 100 percent of the weakened litters have 
died 
farmers and veterinarians first identified the disease about 
seven weeks ago haupert said 
purdue researchers are studying victims of the disease hoping 
to find links to similar illnesses that damaged hog populations in 
north carolina and minnesota last year 
minnesota people called it the plague of 88 said kerry 
keffaber a veterinarian with the swine health center in roann 
keffaber says infected herds in wabash county have 150 to 600 
sows each producing 3000 to 12000 piglets each year 
it isnt killing big hogs said lewis j runnels veterinary 
diagnostician for swine diseases at purdue 
the disease is similar to other illnesses that infect swine 
herds such as aujeskys disease more commonly known as 
pseudorabies 
the disease should not affect entire herds 
its not going to be a wipeout disease meyer said 
medication has done little to help his infected sows and 
piglets haupert said 
meyer suggested that hog producers with healthy swine near 
infected herds should isolate their animals pets should not be 
allowed to roam near an area where the disease has been prevalent 
and then return to a healthy herd

mayor tom bradley said wednesday he couldnt 
explain the narrow margin by which he won an unprecedented fifth 
term of the nations secondlargest city 
you can speculate ive won some close ones and lost some 
close ones winning is better i am satisfied with the election 
he said at a news conference 
pollsters had predicted the 71yearold excop and son of a 
sharecropper would coast to victory instead bradley found himself 
at one point tuesday night barely maintaining the 50 percent needed 
to avoid a runoff in june 
well my friends ive learned something in this election 
never take anything for granted he told supporters in his 1 am 
victory speech 
i made a mistake during the campaign i didnt make the kind 
of vigorous allout effort i could have or should have bradley 
said during the next four years i will be a vigorous allout 
mayor 
a lackluster campaign and apparent voter apathy kept the turnout 
at 17 percent the lowest in decades according to the city clerks 
office just 328194 of the citys 19 million registered voters 
cast ballots 
unofficial results showed bradley with 156724 votes or 52 
percent to freshman councilman nate holdens 84376 votes or 
2799 percent former county supervisor baxter ward had 44816 
votes or 15 percent they were among 10 candidates 
a little more time and more money there could have been a 
difference said holden who gathered only 150000 for his 
campaign war chest compared to bradleys 2 million 
holden told reporters wednesday he would continue his campaign 
to battle crime drugs traffic congestion and overdevelopment 
the people are saying they are dissatisfied with the way this 
city has been managed he said 
he said the outcome of the election conveyed two statements from 
voters the statement was that they are unhappy with the status 
quo and that they want change and another statement was that only 
20 percent of the people felt enough confidence in this election 
and their government to go on and continue to support it 
the people are turned off with the process and i know that 
more now than ever and that is why they stayed at home 
bradley earned the nickname teflon mayor during the campaign 
because political polls showed the citys 3 million residents held 
him blameless for such things as rising crime gang violence 
pollution and traffic congestion holden said his upstart campaign 
showed that bradley wasnt as invincible as he thought 
the mayor drew his fiercest criticism in years just before the 
election when the city attorneys office announced an ethics 
investigation of him after learning the mayor performed consulting 
work with far east national bank which did business with the city 
bradley returned the 18000 he was paid by the bank and called the 
charges politically motivated 
in the los angeles police department bradley rose to the rank 
of lieutenant before leaving police work for politics and election 
to the city council 
bradley mayor since 1973 lost his first bid for the job in 
1969 to incumbent sam yorty he has twice run unsuccessfully for 
governor losing to republican george deukmejian in 1982 and 1986 
other mayoral candidates included raul reyes who got 12 
percent of the vote the other candidates all received less than 1 
percent

some employees of american embassies and 
consulates live too well at taxpayer expense rep john kasich 
rohio said wednesday after convincing the house to limit luxury 
overseas accomodations 
on a voice vote the house added to a state department budget 
bill kasichs proposal to provide betterthanaverage rental houses 
to fewer foreign service workers 
a 1987 report by the state departments inspector general 
indicated the perk of plush housing had been extended beyond its 
intended purpose of giving highranking officials appropriate homes 
in which to entertain official guests 
according to kasichs office the inspector general report and a 
subsequent general accounting office inquiry discovered examples of 
apparent abuse of the housing perk

the killings linked to an alleged voodoo cult 
of drug smugglers appear to be part of mixture of rites with 
african and european elements an anthropologist said wednesday 
although human sacrifices were performed regularly in 
precolumbian times human ritual slayings are unheard of in 
modern mexico said fernando winfield capitaine director of the 
veracruz museum of anthropology in xalapa 
animal sacrifices are very common however as part of the 
widespread superstition and witchcraft that exists in mexico 
nowadays winfield said in a telephone interview 
police in matamoros just across the border from brownsville 
texas have uncovered more than a dozen human bodies apparently 
used by drug smugglers practicing voodoo rites popularly known as 
santeria 
the smugglers apparently tried to offer the souls of others 
human and animal to protect themselves from arrest and harm 
police had arrested several people and were looking on wednesday 
for the alleged ringleader a cuban in his late 40s named adolfo de 
jesus constanzo 
us officials say constanzo apparently introduced elements of 
santeria a caribbean hispanic version of voodoo influenced by 
roman catholicism to the area 
police said the victims bodies were mutilated and that they 
found candles and kettles full of body parts and animal bones in 
the ranch 
ill have to have more information and maybe look for myself 
before i can analyze this further but from what i saw on 
television last night this doesnt seem to be any mexican occult 
ritual said winfield who specializes in prehispanic cultures 
and their religious influence in modern times 
they seem to be a russian salad of rites from various satanic 
cults which the people indulged in probably crazed by drugs he 
said 
winfield said lamps found at the ranch were actually small 
shot glasses blackened with soot and filled with wax with a wick 
stuck in the middle 
these are quite common in mexican witchcraft and are typical 
of the europeanroman catholic black magic rites inherited from 
europe he said but other elements like the kettles seem part 
of the haitianafrican rituals practiced in many places including 
cuba 
winfield said the african rituals were brought by slaves from 
africa and adapted locally to the catholic religion in brazil its 
known as macumbe and in the hispanic caribbean its called 
santeria 
they vary from place to place but the main elements are 
almost all the same winfield said 
santeria is wellknown in floridas latin community especially 
since 125000 cubans immigrated from the cuban port of mariel in 
1980 animal rights activists there have complained that 
practitioners torture animals and may steal and slaughter pets 
santeria priests say animal sacrifice is legal under florida law 
if done humanely priests say they kill only chickens pigs or 
goats never cats or dogs and dispose of remains in a sanitary 
manner 
southern florida has dozens of santeria shops called 
botanicas that sell statues of gods books of incantations 
colored beads and scents 
in mexican marketplaces herbs and other items are sold for 
witchcraft and the work of witch doctors who are powerful figures 
in rural areas where indians still live much the way they did 
before the spanish came 
during the aztec indian empire and other earlier cultures 
priests sacrificed slaves or prisoners of war to the gods by 
cutting their hearts out or flaying or skinning them alive 
usually this involved a ceremony usually a fertility rite 
winfield said 
in modern mexico witchcraft is very common and there are two 
types black magic which mainly tries to cause harm to an enemy 
and white magic which seeks to do good like curing a disease he 
said 
and yes it is common to sacrifice animals like black 
roosters winfield said

president bush reported that he earned 
155662 last year from business holdings kept in a blind trust a 
sum well above his 115000 vice presidential salary 
in the federal tax form that bush filed jointly with his wife 
barbara the pair reported an adjusted gross income of 287171 
that was based on bushs 155662 in interestanddividend 
earnings through partnerships and other interests masked by the 
blind trust and his government salary also included was 7147 in 
other interest along with 12362 in income from other sources 
primarily profits that bush made from his partnership in a firm 
that leased a liquefied natural gas transportation barge in 
louisiana 
the bushes paid taxes equivalent to 216 percent of their total 
income which was nearly 30000 below the 308396 income of 1987 
the government withheld 29480 from bushs income last year 
and he made 65404 in quarterly payments based on assuming what 
his tax liability would be 
when his 1988 federal tax liability of 62106 was deducted from 
the 94884 total in money withheld or prepaid bush had overpaid 
by 32778 white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said he 
applied 15000 to next years tax liability and pocketed 17778 
meanwhile the office of vice president dan quayle released the 
tax forms filed jointly by quayle and his wife marilyn 
the quayles who records show hold assets worth more than 14 
million reported an adjusted gross income of 156546 last year 
the bulk of that coming from quayles 89500 senate salary 
but the form also showed that quayle while a us senator from 
indiana earned 52797 in speaking honoraria last year 16997 
above the maximum senators may accept 
quayle listed charitable contributions totaling 17304 or just 
a little above the 16997 in speaking fees that he could not keep 
for himself 
the vice presidents press secretary dave beckwith said quayle 
had written off the excess speakers fees in an appropriate fashion 
he earned more in honoraria than hes allowed to keep so he 
gave all the excess to charity beckwith said 
the spokesman said quayle gained no tax advantage by writing off 
the extra speaking fees as charitable contributions saying you 
have approximately 17000 more in income and 17000 more in 
deductions to report so its a wash 
quayle earned all his speaking fees before august when the 
republican party nominated him to be bushs vice presidential 
running mate 
the balance of his 156546 income came from interest dividends 
and capital gains relating to his familys central newspapers inc 
quayle also made 2000 as a director of central newspapers a 
position he would have to relinquish under ethics legislation that 
bush proposed to congress thursday 
estimates on bushs net worth have varied substantially 
although records show that the president who made the bulk of his 
money as an oil entrepreneur in texas has assets worth well over 
2 million 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said i would 
say however that reports of his wealth are vastly overestimated 
most of his net worth is in the kennebunkport maine estate 
in his tax return bush reported a net capital gains loss 
through his blind trust transactions of 3480 the nature of the 
loss was not divulged 
after availing himself of the standard 3000 deduction allowed 
by law for such losses bush had a 458 loss which was carried over 
to next years capital gains losses a procedure permitted by the 
us tax code 
bush paid only 3328 in state and local income taxes with most 
of that going to louisiana in payment of taxes based on the income 
generated by his partnership in the bargeleasing leasing 
enterprise the presidents legal home address is in houston and 
texas has no state income tax he did pay some taxes to other 
states fitzwater said but that too is sheltered from disclosure 
by the blind trust 
bush also paid 19034 in real estate taxes with the bulk of 
that involving the walkers point estate at kennebunkport and the 
remainder involving taxes paid on a vacant lot he owns in houston 
and he paid 277 in miscellaneous personal property fees on a 
pickup truck a bronco vehicle and a boat he has in maine 
the bushes donated 12468 to charity including contributions 
to a host of church and civic organizations and donations to 
foundations established in the memory of edward byrne a new york 
city policeman killed in the line of duty and in honor of the late 
margaret fitzgerald grogan the wife of presidential aide gregg 
petersmeyer who died of cancer 
bush also reported 9998 in businessrelated expenses of which 
9712 was reimbursed by the government the vice president is 
given a 10000 allowance for such expenses but 286 of bushs 
claimed expenses were disallowed and so he was therefore able to 
deduct this from his tax liability 
fitzwater said he did know what bush expense submissions were 
rejected

two urns holding soil from the katyn 
graves of 4500 polish officers were displayed at the army museum 
wednesday indicating official poland has come to terms with the 
crime widely attributed to the soviets 
a trickle of mourners some in tears others carrying flowers 
visited the two small black containers which poles say have come 
to symbolize soviet crimes against their country 
it is important historically that these facts are revealed 
said a widow who stood before the memorial with her daughter 
the officers the cream of polish society called up from the 
reserves in world war ii were shot in the back of head and dumped 
in mass graves in katyn near the soviet city of smolensk 
for years polands communist government stuck by the soviet 
accounting of events whereby the nazis committed the murders in 
1941 after invading the soviet union 
but most historians believe the soviet secret police carried out 
the massacre in 1940 when the soviet union and nazi germany were 
still allied and in recent months the official polish position 
has changed 
in 1987 polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski and soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev agreed to appoint a joint commission to 
study blank spots in the two countries histories 
polish members of the commission issued tentative conclusions 
based on what officials called circumstantial evidence pointing to 
soviet responsiblity soviet members reportedly are still studying 
the case 
the government press has written about katyn a subject that had 
been forbidden but not forgotten by poles 
the urns were brought from katyn on april 5 by a delegation of 
victims families they were placed first at a garrison church in 
warsaw where a mass was celebrated by army chaplains 
on wednesday the urns were moved to the army museum where they 
were placed on a pedestal bearing the words soil from the katyn 
graves and draped with a long banner in polands red and white 
colors 
overhead are hung embroidered flags from army units mustered in 
precommunist poland before world war ii officers stand at 
attention on either side 
in ceremonies scheduled for tuesday one urn will be placed on 
the tomb of the unknown soldier and another on a monument to the 
katyn victims at warsaws powazki cemetery 
the wording on the monument which previously blamed hitlerite 
fascists is being changed but the government has not said what 
the new phrasing will be

seigenthaler mr president there are three microphones i see 
george chaplin from honolulu here 
q george chaplin the honolulu advertiser how do you square 
that excellent program youve just outlined to us sir with the 
tower nomination and your support right to the end 
bush i see no contradiction whatsoever 
as you know i dont want to relive the tower question but i 
believe that judgments should be made on on reality not on 
perception 
i didnt like what happened and i dont think that its any 
conflict at all with any of the four points i have made here today 
so id simply and nothing convinced me from the hearings of 
that because i dont think that there was anything that was 
pointed out too definitively that conflicts with what weve talked 
about here 
so i just would respectfully disagree with the conclusion that 
the united states senate reached and im going to work with them 
were going forward now and they promptly confirmed dick 
cheney but i just dont see any conflict there at all 
seigenthaler i cant see who it is at the far microphone but 
if youll identify yourself 
q michael pakenhan from the new york daily news mr president 
this week the house committee reported out a bill which most of 
the people in this room think would severely limit and hamper the 
first amendment it would pass into law the socalled fairness 
doctrine the headcounters say that it will probably go through 
both chambers quite comfortably will you stand with your 
predecessor in vetoing that bill should it come to you 
bush well i dont want to indicate that a veto will be 
necessary but i will stand with the previous position that i was a 
part of in the last administration yes sir applause 
q name inaudible with the washington times mr president 
since youve taken office youve greatly increased the access to 
the presidency on the part of the press and you have taken such 
initiatives as hosting small dinners in your private residence with 
reporters and editors this has sparked some debate and if i can 
frame it if youll permit me to frame it in the spirit of our 
morning session with morton downey and geraldo rivera and others 
is he trying to woo us and may he succeed in seducing us mr 
president if you would explain your philosophy to press coverage 
of the presidency and the relationship with your administration i 
realize that some of the debate is probably our ability to 
complain no matter what kind of access we get but id like to 
hear your views of your relationship to the media 
bush well in the first place when barbara and i invite a 
reporter and her spouse or a reporter and his spouse to the white 
house for an upstairs dinner were not were doing that not to 
seduce the press light laughter 
were treating them as human beings 
and one of the reasons youve asked my press policy 
one of the reasons i dont take questions over the sound of the 
helicopter blades out there is i want to treat the press with the 
dignity to which it is entitled 
and if you have to get your question answered by screaming at me 
when i dont want to answer it you dont look very good and i 
dont think its very good for the white house

two consumer groups on wednesday urged 
motorists to boycott exxon gasoline in response to the companys 
alaskan oil spill and subsequent gas price increases 
the citizenlabor energy coalition and citizen action urged 
holders of exxon corp credit cards to cut up their cards and send 
half of each to the make exxon pay boycott office in washington 
the organizations said they would deliver the card pieces to 
exxon at the companys annual meeting may 18 in new jersey 
we are asking consumers to boycott exxon not just because of 
its environmental irresponsibility and recklessness but also 
because the company has raised its gasoline prices to make 
consumers help pay for the cleanup of the march 24 oil spill in 
prince william sound said edwin s rothschild spokesman for the 
groups 
rothschild said exxon wholesale gasoline prices had risen more 
than 11 cents per gallon since the accident giving exxon 25 
million in additional revenue he acknowledged that other oil 
companies gasoline prices also had risen in recent weeks but said 
this does not in any way diminish the need to teach exxon a 
lesson 
the rise in gas prices following the disruption of alaskan crude 
oil deliveries to west coast refineries also has stirred concern on 
capitol hill sen howard metzenbaum dohio has said his energy 
regulation and conservation subcommittee is investigating whether 
the price increases were justified 
in response to the consumer groups boycott call exxons new 
york headquarters issued a statement reiterating its regret about 
the oil spill 
all of our customers are very valuable to us and we hope that 
our effort in alaska will convince them that we continue to be a 
responsible company and one people like to do business with the

city authorities on wednesday suspended 
the head of a hospital department where four nursing aides 
confessed to at least 49 mercy killings and they ordered the 
exhumation of bodies of several presumed victims 
dr franz pesendorfers suspension follows mounting criticism of 
his reported refusal to cooperate with police during an 
investigation last year to find evidence of mass killings at 
viennas lainz hospital 
four assistant nurses arrested since friday have confessed to 
killing at least 49 elderly patients with overdoses of medicine or 
by forcing water into their lungs most victims were in their 80s 
newspaper reports say the lives of 22 of the 49 victims could 
have been saved if pesendorfer had cooperated last year when 
senior investigator max edelbacher said police met a wall of 
silence at the hospital 
pesendorfer defended his conduct on a national television 
discussion wednesday evening 
pesendorfer said he was told last april by a female doctor that 
another doctor dr waschnig learned in a wine bar of rumors that 
patients were being put to rest by assistant nurses 
pesendorfer said he alerted doctors and senior nurses to the 
rumor and ordered an immediate blood test on an 84yearold woman 
who died unexpectedly days later 
the blood test results prompted him to advise city medical 
officials and the hospital director and police were called 
pesendorfer said 
a later forensic test on the 84yearold woman turned up nothing 
suspicious officials have said 
pesendorfer said dr waschnigs name was mentioned in the 
presence of police although he was not identified as the source of 
the rumor a police report says pesendorfer refused to give 
investigators the name of the doctor who alerted him to the 
possible killings 
austrias largest daily newspaper neue kronen zeitung asserted 
that if pesendorfer and the second doctor had not kept quiet it 
would fairly certainly have been possible to stop the series of 
murders a year ago 
as it was however the sadistic nurses could kill another 22 
people the newspaper said 
police have not confirmed media reports that 22 people were 
killed in the past year 
the killings reportedly began in 1983 at lainz hospitals 
pavilion five dubbed the death pavilion by neue kronen zeitung 
on wednesday patients sat in stairwells smoking cigarettes and 
whispering about pesendorfers suspension but they refused to talk 
to reporters so did pesendorfer and hospital officials 
the hospital refused to describe the function of the first 
medical department which pesendorfer ran however it appears to 
practice general medicine on people suffering ailments related to 
old age 
mayor helmut zilk said he suspended pesendorfer on the grounds 
of the results to date of the police investigations he declined 
further comment 
in a statement read on the television discussion program zilk 
added the suspension was intended not as a judgement of pesendorfer 
but to facilitate further inquiries and encourage his staff to 
speak out 
alois stacher chief of the citys health department said the 
suspension was linked to lingering lack of clarity over the 
investigation 
pesendorfer consistently has defended his role and the conduct 
of officials in his department at lainz viennas fourthlargest 
hospital since first word of the killings on friday 
assistant nurses maria gruber 25 irene leidorf 37 and 
waltraud wagner 30 were detained friday another assistant nurse 
stephanie mayer 50 was detained sunday after ms ferradaavendano 
went to police she too was arrested after she admitted witnessing 
one of the killings edelbacher said 
three other witnesses have come forward edelbacher said two say 
they witnessed killings as patients in the hospital while another 
the daughter of a patient who has since died reported her 
mother told her about killings at the hospital 
the nursing aides have not been charged but police say ms 
wagner alone has confessed to killing 39 patients 
her lawyer wilhelm philipp hinted it may be difficult for 
police to get any murder charges to stick 
he was quoted by austria press agency as speaking of socalled 
confessions to police and noting state prosecutors will have to 
prove the murder really did happen because of his clients 
actions 
in an apparent attempt to get more evidence city authorities 
late wednesday ordered the exhumation of the bodies of several 
presumed victims officials declined to identify the bodies or say 
how many will be exhumed 
pesendorfer is the first doctor or official suspended because of 
the killings

national drug policy director william j 
bennett asked congress on wednesday for a 12 million budget in 
1990 an 85 million increase over the current budget and freedom 
to allocate the money as he sees fit 
why this amount why this growth given the fact that the 1989 
appropriation of 35 million was intended to cover our operations 
for only a portion of the year and given the substantial tasks 
facing this office i believe it will become apparent that the 12 
million proposed for 1990 is a very reasonable request bennett 
told the house appropriations subcommittee on treasury postal 
service and general government 
whats more i believe it is vital to the advancement of this 
nations drug control efforts he said adding that it would be 
spent to provide for 64 jobs 24 more positions than appeared in 
the budget proposed by thenpresident reagan in january 
in addition bennett requested a change in the appropriation 
language to remove the earmarking of 7 million for staff and 5 
million for research to give him greater flexibility in how the 
money is spent 
it is not clear to me yet what the size of this office should 
be what the strategy should be he told the panel adding 
however i intend to keep this office lean and mean i do not 
intend to build a bureaucracy 
asked why he wanted to merge the funds bennett said theres 
a lot of research going on in the 30odd agencies involved in these 
areas its possible he said that his office would not need to 
spend money for research but could use that money instead for 
personnel 
although he was pressed repeatedly by panel members for specific 
plans for various agencies and budgets such as the customs service 
and the drug enforcement administration bennett declined to 
provide details 
im essentially listening now to what people tell me 
im getting peoples perspectives on how to structure the 
national drug control strategy which by law he must provide 180 
days from his swearing in march 13 
bennett said the strategy which will include priorities and 
financing requests will be completed by sept 5 
meanwhile district of columbia mayor marion barry jr said he 
has a cordial relationship with bennett even though one of 
barrys top aides and not the mayor himself is handling the 
districts involvement with bennetts office 
in releasing a multimillion dollar federal plan designed to 
help the city curb its record murder rate bennett lashed out 
monday at barrys government and accused the city of letting the 
drug problem grow out of control 
i dont want us to get sidetracked by any personalities or 
debates barry said wednesday after a meeting with other 
washingtonarea local government officials the issue isnt 
william bennett and marion barry of the city government the issue 
is the international trafficking of drugs

the number of americans who know their 
cholesterol level has nearly doubled in a year and more than four 
in 10 say they have changed their eating habits to cut their 
cholesterol a poll said tuesday 
among 1016 people age 18 or over polled by the gallup 
organization in january 31 percent said they knew their 
cholesterol level a year before when gallup asked the same 
question just 17 percent knew 
that increase clearly indicates that people are getting the 
message that cholesterol can contribute to heart disease said 
dr dewitt s goodman the head of an advisory board on cholesterol 
for voluntary hospitals of america inc which commissioned the 
survey 
the survey conducted jan 922 and released by the organization 
tuesday found that about twothirds of respondents said they had 
taken a blood test to check their cholesterol level and four in 10

the federal aviation administration said 
wednesday it plans enforcement action against more than 1000 
pilots who failed to report required information about alcohol or 
drugrelated convictions 
the faa said the pilots could have their medical certificates 
revoked and their airman certificates suspended or revoked 
depending on the seriousness of the violations 
the faa said more than 6000 names were obtained through 
computer matches of faa medical records and fbi criminal history 
records and florida state motor vehicle records 
the search the faa said in a written statement turned up a 
significant number of airmen who appear to have falsified their 
applications for airmen medical certification with regard to drug 
convictions and drug or alcoholrelated traffic convictions 
the faa said that because of the large number of cases the faa 
plans to focus its enforcement effort only on cases involving 
convictions since feb 17 1984 although it may take action in 
severe older cases 
the agency said it would also take action where necessary in 
cases involving drug convictions but no falsification of 
applications for faa certificates 
in a separate matter the faa proposed a new safety rule that 
would increase the number of flight attendants that must be present 
to supervise passenger boarding operations when an airliner is on 
the ground 
the proposal would mainly affect midsize airline aircraft with 
101 to 150 seats and in many cases would require two attendants to 
remain on board instead of one 
the faa said it was publishing the proposed rule in the federal 
register this week and soliciting comment

and so what ive tried to do is have enough availability in 
fact im going to cross this one up as a press conference for the 
record one more notch laughter so i can go to those 
doubters and say look we want to be accessible 
but i would separate out you know i i dont know what well 
do at christmas 
but what barbara and i try to do at our house is say hey you 
and joan and jean or whoever it is come on to the christmas 
party and not have to have it all categorized and so afraid that 
somebody thinks im trying to seduce some reporter that you have to 
be treated as something so different than anybody else 
and so availability dont get mad when they ask stuff you 
dont like and treat people as you would whatever walk of life 
or whatever occupation they come from 
and if its misinterpreted fine you dont have to come 
and so i understand i remember back a few years ago when one 
of the great news organizations said ok were no longer going 
to be used we dont want any backgrounders or offtherecord 
lasted about 30 seconds laughter and those reporters came 
trooping back in 
and but i respected that if thats the way they want to do it 
but please believe me that when we do it this way its what we 
feel is appropriate and if its not ill sure you know i think 
well take a hit but im unpersuaded by the gentle logic of 
morton downey and whoever that other guy was that was here 
laughter 
seigenthaler mr president i believe 
bush on that question 
seigenthaler sir 
q mr president jack tinsley fort worth startelegram since 
youve announced this ethics program for the executive branch id 
like to ask your comments about another situation involving ethics 
bush whoops scattered laughter 
q that is the longrunning 
bush nice try jack laughs 
go ahead 
q that is the longrunning ethics committee investigation of 
house speaker jim wright the washington times reported this 
morning that the findings of this committee would be turned over to 
the justice department for investigation of possible federal law 
violations and also there is a belief by some in texas that since 
the rejection of john tower as your first nominee for secretary of 
defense that there might be an attempt by the republican party to 
retaliate against speaker wright would you comment on that please 
bush well let me comment on the last part first and i know 
of no such retaliatory action 
i think it would be impossible to do anyway and it would be 
wrong 
and certainly i would condemn anyone in our administration that 
had any hand in anything of that nature 
secondly there is nothing in this ethics package when i call 
for an even playing field congress executive branch and judicial 
branch to have the same standards that should in any way 
directly or indirectly be interpreted as intervening in the matter 
now before the house ethics committee

researchers at moscow university have achieved 
nuclear fusion at room temperature in tests similar to experiments 
carried out in the united states the official tass news agency 
said wednesday 
under the guidance of professor runar kuzmin researchers at 
the solid matter laboratory of the physics department of moscow 
university have confirmed the experiments of us colleagues to 
obtain nuclear fusion at room temperature tass said 
two weeks ago scientists at the university of utah and at the 
university of southhampton in britain said they had achieved fusion 
using ordinary laboratory equipment at room temperature 
their experiments used a rod of palladium and a coil of platinum 
immersed in a beaker of deuterium an isotope of hydrogen commonly 
found in seawater officials at the universities said 
however many experts reamined unconvinced that fusion actually 
took place in those experiments and some suggested the phenomenon 
may be something new to science 
tass indicated similarities between the experiments at moscow 
university and the campuses in britain and the united states 
kuzmin told tass that researchers inserted electrodes an anode 
and a cathode into a beaker of deuterium the electrodes were 
manufactured from titanium and palladium he said 
the researchers then applied electric current to the electrodes 
until the water reached a boiling point and registered the 
release of fast neutrons with the help of a detector the news 
agency said 
it is precisely judging by the release of neutrons that one 
can assert with confidence that the nuclear fusion reaction 
actually takes place kuzmin said 
he said the researchers made no attempt to calculate the ratio 
of energy applied to the energy released 
according to evaluations of us scientists this reaction 
probably releases four times more energy than is expended to 
stimulate nuclear fusion he said 
anatoly logunov a rector of moscow university told tass that a 
program of fundamental research into the new type of fusion will 
begin in the near future 
at this stage logunov said it is difficult to say whether 
the reaction would be economically profitable for obtaining energy 
on an industrial scale

oliver north testified wednesday he thought he 
was protecting president reagan when he altered six irancontra 
problem memos before investigators from the attorney general 
could get a look at them 
appearing pale and on edge in his fifth day on the witness 
stand north hotly denied he had been working in a den of 
thieves at the national security council and he said the 
documents he destroyed were only the tip of the iceberg 
compared to those in the hands of prosecutors 
north said he was present as the irancontra affair was about 
to burst into public view when national security adviser john 
poindexter tore up a december 1985 presidential finding 
retroactively authorizing a shipment of missiles to iran in a 
failed effort to win the release of american hostages in lebanon 
poindexters testimony on destroying the document making no 
mention of norths presence was one of the more startling 
revelations during the congressional irancontra hearings in 1987 
where is the finding now prosecutor john keker asked north 
a i dont know 
q what happened to it 
a im told it was destroyed 
q by whom 
a admiral poindexter 
q when 
a nov 212223 1986 
q when did you learn admiral poindexter destroyed the finding 
a i was there i saw him tear it in two 
north said high administration officials did not want the 
finding exposed it would have been an embarrassment north said 
because it looked like an armsforhostages swap reagan had 
said often he would not negotiate with kidnappers 
keker asked whether north knew it was the only version in 
existence the only paper in the entire world with reagans 
authorization north said he didnt know 
during the congressional hearings poindexter said of the 
finding i thought it was politically embarrassing so i decided 
to tear it up tore it up and put it in a burn bag behind my 
desk 
that same day north said nov 21 his former boss robert 
mcfarlane reminded him to sanitize six notes which indicated 
reagans or mcfarlanes knowledge of what north had done for the 
nicaraguan contras 
north testified he had orders of a years standing from 
mcfarlane to alter the memos 
a list of the documents all memos he had sent to mcfarlane on 
the internal nsc computer network had been taped to his computer 
terminal that whole year north said 
the gist of what he wanted removed from the documents was 
language that would indicate his knowledge or the presidents 
knowledge about my activities in this time frame north testified 
north had been coordinating efforts to sell arms to iran and to 
help the nicaraguan rebels at a time when the united states had 
ordered an embargo on weapons to iran and congress had banned 
official aid to the contras reagan has said he authorized selling 
arms to iran but didnt know of the diversion of some profits to 
the rebels 
on nov 21 1986 as the secret irancontra dealings were 
beginning to unravel in public north told his secretary fawn 
hall to make the changes in the memos this was a day before aides 
to attorney general edwin meese iii searched norths office 
mr mcfarlane asked me if certain things had been taken care 
of north said he asked me point blank whether it had been 
done and i said no not yet that i would get around to it 
mcfarlane had left the national security council the previous 
december but north said he felt he had to carry out the order 
i had been led to believe that everything i was doing was done 
at the direction of the president he said 
you had been told by the president of the united states to 
destroy documents explain how you had come to that conclusion 
keker asked 
because everything i had done that was described in the 
documents on this list i had been told was at the direction of the 
president north replied 
norths testimony contradicts mcfarlane who said it was north 
who proposed making changes to the documents in late summer 1985 
meanwhile president bush said he still considers north a 
decorated vietnam veteran a national hero because anybody that 
gets a purple heart sheds his blood fighting for his country 
deserves to be called an american hero 
bush has refused to answer questions about trial documents 
concerning his own involvement in the irancontra affair saying he 
doesnt want to prejudice norths trial he said again wednesday 
the last thing i want to do is intervene in that matter that is 
now before the courts 
a document introduced at norths criminal trial this week 
seemingly supported the idea that bush then vice president knew 
in 1985 that honduras was being rewarded for its support of the 
contras with additional us aid 
the document a feb 20 1985 national security council draft 
memo bears the handwritten notation we want vp to also discuss 
this matter with honduran president roberto suazo next to a 
typewritten section detailing the tradeoff 
a 42page summary of reagan administration irancontra dealing 
with other countries was introduced at the trial last week it said 
bush met with suazo and told him about enhanced us aid shortly 
after the arrangement was made for honduras to help the contras 
but it did not say whether bush knew of the connection 
three of the 12 charges on which north is being tried concern 
the altering of documents keker like north a former marine who 
had served in vietnam hammered away on wednesday at the 
circumstances of the changed memos 
earlier wednesday north blamed mcfarlane for sending a letter 
to congress that falsely denied the nsc staff was assisting the 
contra rebels in nicaragua 
i wrote a number of other letters that were inconsistent 
with the facts i just simply do not believe i wrote this 
letter

a reporter for the columbia sc state was in 
tbilisi georgia with a group of high school exchange students when 
a weekend street protest turned into a deadly melee that made 
headlines worldwide she filed this report for the associated 
press 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at 5 am alex raley stepped onto the 
balcony of his fourthfloor hotel room in tbilisi and looked down 
onto a street filled with protesters soviet soldiers and armored 
personal carriers 
as raley an educator from south carolina and his wife watched 
in the glow of streetlights what began as a demonstration for 
independence for soviet georgia turned into a bloody clash that 
left at least 19 people dead 
at first we werent concerned when we heard the loud 
noises raley said but then we saw soviet soldiers with metal 
shields and night sticks 10 to 15 soldiers deep filling the 
entire street 
they were literally pushing hundreds of students who at that 
time started throwing stones 
raley said the soldiers were followed by tanks he said students 
who were beaten during the fighting ducked into alleyways and shops 
along tbilisis main thoroughfare rustaveli street for medical 
care he said 15 ambulances came to help the injured after the 
tanks ran through the street 
raley was accompanying 15 high school exchange students from 
columbia sc who had been staying with georgian families they 
were flown out of tbilisi on tuesday at the request of the soviet 
government and now are staying in moscow until arrangements can be 
made for the students to finish their exchange in another city 
all the american students slept through the sunday morning 
conflict in the safety of their hosts homes 
clare coggeshall 16 said however she woke after hearing a 
woman wailing for hours 
i remember thinking that i wished she would shut up she 
said 
the next morning ms coggeshall discovered the woman was the 
mother of one of the demonstrators killed 
the scene was far different from the almostfestive atmosphere 
the young south carolinians had found on wedneday april 5 when 
they first arrived in this city 900 miles south of moscow 
on sunday black banners hung from balconies broken glass 
littered the strets along with torn official soviet georgian flags 
red with a blue strip running across the top a mural near the 
center of town reading brotherhood throughout the ussr 
was charred at the bottom from being set on fire 
the streets were deserted and red army soldiers broke up any 
gatherings of more than a few people 
some of the american students fearing their parents would be 
worried had gathered at one of the homes to try to call home to 
america they had no luck 
their teacher sherry beasley waited by her phone hoping to 
hear from the us embassy or the usussr partnership the 
organization that arranged the trip neither she later learned 
after reaching moscow could get through on the jammed telephone 
lines 
raley his wife and a crew of four from south carolina 
educational television who were along to film the student 
exchange were trapped in the hotel tbilisi barricaded on both 
sides by tanks none of the americans had their passports or soviet 
visas with them the documents had been taken two days earlier to 
register them for a trip to the mountains 
it was one of the many sightseeing trips the students never got 
to take because of the demonstrations 
when the teenagers first arrived their georgian hosts told 
them with a touch of embarrassment that students in tbilisi had 
been protesting for three days making travel a little difficult 
their attitude about the protests was so casual however that a 
few jokes were cracked about its being an attempt by the university 
students to get out of going to class 
as the young americans drove into the city they passed 
thousands of georgians jamming rustaveli street holding hands 
singing and carrying traditional homemade georgian flags of 
maroon black and white 
many of the protesters were part of a hunger strike and they 
sat wrapped in blankets on the steps of the local television 
station others crowding the narrow backstreets had set up pup 
tents in church backyards 
speeches were given through bullhorns every day at the 
government palace hub of the demonstrations 
by friday the state museum and tbilisi school no 1 both near 
the palace were shut down because of crowds clogging the street 
on saturday afternoon electricity was cut off to many parts of the 
georgian capital rumor had it that power was turned off to silence 
loudspeakers at a rally set for 5 pm 
several georgian families quietly made preparations to move the 
american teenagers to the nearby mountains or in with relatives on 
the outskirts of town 
students growing a bit homesick found they could not contact 
america or even moscow by telephone their isolation did not end 
until they were whisked out of tbilisi on tuesday morning passing 
through army barricades on the way to the airport 
the students clung to their georgian families before leaving 
saying they felt safe and did not want to go to moscow 
were just so worried for them said melissa milling 16 
we had gotten so close to them we dont want to leave them 
behind 
twelve georgian students had stayed with the american students 
in february in south carolina and the exchange was supposed to 
last for three more weeks in tbilisi

army officials said wednesday the arrest of 
four alleged leaders of the palestinian uprising was a major blow 
to the 16monthold revolt but palestinians said the captures 
would not end their struggle 
also wednesday police charged a jewish settler leader rabbi 
moshe levinger with manslaughter in the death last year of an arab 
shopkeeper in the west bank town of hebron 
in clashes in the occupied gaza strip troops shot and wounded 
15 palestinians including a 7yearold boy arab hospital 
officials said the army confirmed five casualties 
at least 423 palestinians and 18 israelis have died in the 
violence which began in december 1987 
the palestinians whose arrests were announced tuesday are 
accused of belonging to the unified national leadership of the 
uprising an umbrella group of plo and moslem fundamentalist 
factions 
the unified leadership coordinates the uprising by issuing broad 
strategy directives through underground leaflets daily activities 
are usually planned by local popular committees 
its clearly a blow to the uprising these were organizers 
these were experienced leaders at the executive level col 
ranaan gissin an army spokesman said of the march 5 arrests 
but palestinians said the leaders would be replaced quickly 
it is an uprising of the people not of a few individuals 
said radwan abu ayyash head of the arab journalists association 
two of the detainees saman khouri 41 and adnan shalalda 35 
were remanded into custody wednesday by a military court 
khouri allegedly belongs to the democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine a radical prosyrian plo faction 
the charge sheet said he was instrumental in channeling 15 
million from the plo overseas to plo factions in the occupied lands 
and that he helped write two underground leaflets 
khouri denied the charges i did not do any of the things im 
charged with he said wednesday 
shalalda was accused of being a member of the popular front for 
the liberation of palestine a marxist prosyrian plo faction he 
has also pleaded innocent 
the two others journalists taher shaludi 35 and hassan abed 
rabbo 28 have not been formally charged 
shaludi allegedly is a member of the palestinian communist 
party and abed rabbo is accused of belonging to fatah 
these are the leaders of the four major terror organizations 
operating in the occupied territories said an army official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
levinger meanwhile was charged with manslaughter causing 
bodily harm in aggravated circumstances and intentionally damaging 
property 
the charges stem from a sept 30 1988 incident in which 
levinger allegedly opened fire on stone throwers in hebron after 
they smashed his car windows 
levinger 54 left the car and fired in the air from his 
pistol the charges said he then shot and killed kayed hassan 
salah 42 a shoe store owner who was standing outside his shop 
one of salahs customers was also wounded the charges said 
the jerusalemborn rabbi said he was not officially informed of 
the charges 
levinger is at the forefront of the jewish settlement movement 
in the occupied territories a year after israel captured the lands 
in the 1967 middle east war levinger founded the jewish settlement 
of kiryat arba outside hebron 
about 70000 jews live among 17 million palestinians in 130 
settlements in the occupied lands

moslem and christian forces turned their 
howitzers on residential areas of beirut on wednesday killing 12 
people in a withering attack on the eve of the civil wars 14th 
anniversary 
the leader of the christian army said the fighting had reduced 
lebanon to a cadaver in a coffin and urged the superpowers to 
help end the fighting 
the shelling duel was the fiercest since the arab league called 
a ceasefire in lebanon a week ago it began a few minutes after a 
group of rightwing christian politicians left beirut for more 
peace talks in kuwait 
the barrage which shattered an overnight lull took civilians 
by surprise and forced them to rush back to bunkers and underground 
bomb shelters 
shopkeepers lowered their shutters employees ran out of their 
offices and pedestrians ran in all directions seeking shelter 
the whooshing sound of outgoing rockets and the thuds of shell 
explosions rocked beiruts moslem and christian sectors 
black smoke billowed from west beiruts corniche mazraa 
commercial thoroughfare and the lowincome cola district fire 
engines raced to battle the blaze police said 
motorists sped away after a shell slammed into the seaside 
boulevard near fish restaurants in moslem west beiruts raouche 
district 
french ambassador paul blanc told reporters a shell scored a 
direct hit on the french embassy compound in the christian suburb 
of hazmiyeh it inflicted damage but no casualties blanc said 
a lebanese christian security guard at the us embassy was 
found shot to death near the embassy compound in a suburb north of 
beirut thursday police reported elias haddad 24 was shot in the 
head and his body was dumped in a building entrance about a mile 
from the compound in aukar they said 
police said 12 people were killed and 38 wounded in the daylong 
bombardment of moslem and christian residential districts in the 
capital 
in all 192 people have been killed and 657 wounded in the most 
recent round of fighting which began march 8 between army 
commander gen michel aouns mainly christian troops and an 
alliance of syrian and druse forces 
aoun called a news conference to renew his demand for a syrian 
withdrawal the syrian occupation is as ruthless and barbarian as 
the israeli occupation of a strip of southern lebanon aoun said 
asked what has been achieved since he declared a war of 
liberation three weeks ago to drive the syrians out aoun said 
lebanon has been a cadaver in a coffin we were carrying for 
burial in a funeral procession spanning 14 years now the cadaver 
bolted straight up from the coffin to declare its very much alive 
but the syrians unleashed their bombing wrath to finish it off 
anew 
he called on the united states and the soviet union to stop 
looking the other way otherwise you will both be haunted by the 
lebanon curse forever 
both sides blamed each other for starting wednesdays artillery 
duel 
the latest round of fighting began after aoun who also heads 
the christian military cabinet in lebanons divided government 
ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by moslem militias the 
militias led by druse warlord walid jumblatt responded by 
shelling beirut port and the christian enclave 
later syrian gunners joined in the shelling and supported a 
land blockade of the christian heartland by moslem troops 
lebanons civil war enters its 15th year thursday and the 
fighting and the divided government threaten the nation with 
permanent sectarian partition 
the war started after christians became alarmed at the surge in 
palestinian guerrilla power in lebanon and moslems demanded an 
equal share of power with the christians who dominated lebanon 
since independence from france in 1943 
at that time christians were in the majority but now moslems 
have become the majority making up an estimated 55 percent of the 
4 million population the christians have refused to surrender 
their longheld privileges 
since 1975 lebanon has become the battleground for regional 
powers such as syria and israel the civil war has degenerated into 
a web of overlapping conflicts between rival factions that has 
defied all peace efforts including the illfated intervention of 
the usled multinational force in 1982 
us secretary of state james baker recently said the americans 
plan no new initiative in lebanon the united states is still 
haunted by the deaths of more than 240 marines killed by a shiite 
moslem suicide bomber on oct 23 1983 
concern for the fate of 15 foreign hostages including nine 
americans held in lebanon by proiranian extremists also 
contributes to the reluctance of us officials to become involved

and thirdly jack youll have to and i know theres this 
interest particularly in your area and in my state and i think 
its wider than that now in the matters that are going forward 
there but the last thing i want to do is involve myself in any 
way 
and please believe me there is no on my view i answered the 
first question as frankly as i could about the john tower matter 
but in terms of getting even or something of that nature by 
unfairly intervening into a process that is now being handled by 
the ethics committee in the house i simply wouldnt condone that 
at all and i would condemn it 
so i want to separate out whats happening there from this 
package and certainly in response to your question from any 
politics of retaliation because of my view that the tower matter 
was not handled the way i would like to have seen it handled 
seigenthaler mr president if we could go the far if you 
pardon the expression the far right its really their far left 
scattered laughter 
q mr president dan martin the heralddispatch huntington 
wva at this point in time would you call ollie north a real 
american hero 
bush anybody that gets a purple heart and sheds his blood 
fighting for his country deserves to be called an american hero 
and it was in that context that i made those claims and it is 
that context that i will repeat them 
and the last thing i want to do is intervene in that matter that 
is now before the courts 
but thats how i feel about those who risk their lives to save 
this country 
seigenthaler i cant tell who this is 
q mr president don james of the times recordnews in wichita 
falls texas in view of the fact that theres a program on the 
table to put a space establishment in houston and the super 
collider is going to be built in jacks backyard or has been 
selected to be built in jacks backyard and two or three of the 
top administrative officials are from texas is there a real 
backlash developing because of that we saw the georgia mafia we 
saw the california mafia talked about by the press is this going 
to happen and is it going to hurt your program 
bush no scattered laughter 
no weve made appointments that are excellent in my view men 
and women outstanding and the fact that some of them come from my 
home state hey whats wrong with that 
and the super collider decision was made by president reagan 
its a good decision 
i want to support it 
the space center was made by i guess when president johnson 
was in office or maybe under president kennedy im not sure 
and it should have strong support 
but i dont see any risk of backlash at all provided that you 
get people that measure up and thats what im trying to do

president bush urged a ban on campaign 
contributions by political action committees and said he opposed 
federal financing of congressional races wednesday as he unveiled 
proposals to tighten ethical rules for congress judges and the 
executive branch 
weve got to work together to reform a public code of conduct 
that at times appears to be in disarray bush said and its 
not logical or fair its both too harsh and too lenient and it 
elevates detail over substance precept over principle 
bush announced his program in a speech to the annual convention 
of the american society of newspaper editors most of his proposals 
were embraced in a legislative proposal he sent to congress or an 
executive order he signed during the day 
suggesting a major change in the way congressional campaigns are 
financed bush called for a halt to campaign contributions from 
political action committees which pumped nearly 156 million 
directly into congressional races last year 
we have allowed our parties to become weakened and 
overshadowed by special interests and we can best restore the role 
of the parties by limiting political action committees bush said 
pacs weaken the parties restrain competition and deaden the 
political debate the president added 
aside from the 156 million in direct contributions pacs spent 
68 million to help specific congressional candidates but the 
money went for such expenses as television commercials and mailings 
with nothing going directly into the candidates campaign 
treasuries according to records at the federal election commission 
bushs presidential campaign received 862950 in direct 
contributions from pacs last year and benefitted from million of 
dollars the pacs spent independently on its behalf one pac alone 
the national security political action committee spent 81 
million to help bush according to fec records 
stopping short of offering a formal proposal bush said he would 
consult with congress on pac funds brushing aside a plan espoused 
chiefly by democrats bush added i also oppose federal funding 
of congressional campaigns 
if adopted the net result of bushs recommendations would be 
for congressional races to be financed by private contributions 
already limited by law to 1000 per candidate per election 
bush urged congress to eliminate a provision of law allowing 
legislators to convet leftover campaign funds to personal use as 
is permitted for anyone who held office before 1980 
political donations should not become a sort of individual 
retirement account for members of the united states congress the 
president said 
in a question and answer session with the editors bush said 
he has given a full accounting of his role in the reagan 
administrations secret program to supply the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
referring to reports about his role emanating from the trial of 
former white house aide oliver north bush said i dont like 
reading charges that i happen to feel are untrue but i have to 
stand on that and that just goes with the territory 
he said he still considers north a hero based on his decorated 
service in the vietnam war 
said the federal government had moved much more quickly and 
more boldly than it gets credit for in the cleanup of alaskas 
oil spill nevertheless he said maybe i should accept some 
criticism on whether i should have sent in federal troops a week 
earlier than he did 
he would not commit himself to veto the fairness doctrine if it 
is reinstated by congressional action thenpresident reagan vetoed 
a renewal of the regulation last year and bush said i will stand 
with the previous position of the reagan administration 
his offtherecord social contacts with reporters were not 
intended to seduce the press were treating them as human 
beings 
among the main points of his ethics proposals bush called for a 
25 percent pay increase for federal judges coupled with a ban on 
members of the judiciary accepting speaking fees and other 
honoraria 
bush said he supported higher pay for congress as well as a ban 
on honoraria for lawmakers but would not make a specific proposal 
until he consulted with legislative leaders 
there is no point absolutely no point in putting congress 
through another traumatic bashing like the one just completed he 
said after a public uprising congress killed a 51 percent pay 
increase for itself earlier this year 
bush proposed that members of congress and senior personnel in 
the judicial and congressional branches who leave the government be 
barred from lobbying their former colleagues for one year 
executive branch employees already subject to such a ban would 
be prohibited from contact with any executive branch agency 
bush also said that members of congress should be covered by the 
same independent counsel law that has been used in authorizing 
investigations of alleged improprieties by members of the executive 
branch 
the president said that a practice is either ethical or it is 
not and if washington is to be a level playing field then every 
player should be treated the same 
in his executive order bush barred senior government officials 
from serving on the boards of profitmaking enterprises he 
proposed that the ban be extended to congressional and judicial 
officials as well 
the executive order also would give elevated rank to a 
designated ethics officer in each department 
fulltime presidential appointees white house employees and 
office of policy development employees also would be barred from 
receiving any outside earned income

the warsaw pact on wednesday unveiled a detailed 
proposal to nato for starting negotiations to eliminate shortrange 
nuclear weapons in europe in a move that could widen differences 
within the western alliance 
the north atlantic treaty organization already has rejected 
previous soviet pressure to begin talks aimed at reducing or 
eliminating the tactical nuclear weapons which have a range of 
less than 310 miles 
but a growing number of people in west germany a key nato 
country have expressed doubt the shortrange weapons are still 
needed because of a perceived reduction of the east bloc threat 
warsaw pact foreign ministers ending a twoday meeting in east 
berlin issued a communique proposing separate negotiations in 
the near future on tactical nuclear weapons in europe 
the communique said preparations for the proposed 
negotiations its mandate and who should participate can be 
discussed in special consultations which it said the warsaw pact 
countries are ready to begin immediately 
most of natos shortrange nuclear weapons are based in west 
germany 
the warsaw pact also said both sides should agree not to 
modernize their shortrange nuclear weapons the warsaw pact has 
previously denounced natos modernization plans which also are 
opposed by a growing number of west germans 
the member states of the warsaw pact are of the opinion that a 
decision not to modernize tactical atomic weapons would create a 
favorable atmosphere for such negotiations the communique said

president bush said wednesday he still 
believes the federal government should not have taken over the 
alaskan oil spill cleanup effort although he conceded it could 
have gotten involved earlier 
fielding questions after a speech to a convention of the 
american society of newspaper editors bush maintained the 
administration moved more quickly and more boldly than it gets 
credit for 
but at the same time he said maybe i should accept some 
criticism that he should have moved earlier than april 7 to step 
up federal involvement in the environmental disaster off the coast 
of alaska 
bush said that he now believes the federal government is 
properly involved in that effort and said we should not have 
done what some are urging upon us federalizing that whole 
cleanup 
last friday bush put transportation secretary samuel skinner in 
charge of coordinating actions by federal agencies in connection 
with cleaning up the spill from the exxon valdez in prince william 
sound he also ordered the defense department to make military 
troops and equipment available to assist in the effort 
bush said that while he was pleased the federal government has 
stepped up its involvement in the cleanup i would also like to 
see more volunteers involved the president said he believes 
liability laws should be eased to that volunteer groups wont be 
kept from helping out because of fears by the government of 
potentially outrageous liability claims 
we have moved forward on the cleanup he said the first 
was containment and now its mainly in the cleanup phase although 
there still are some containment problems 
on other matters bush said 
he often invites reporters to private white house social 
events although he is not doing it to get friendlier coverage from 
the white house press corps 
bush said he and first lady barbara extend such invitations 
not to defuse the press treating them as human beings 
he knows of no retaliatory action taken by his 
administration because of the senate defeat of former sen john 
tower as a nominee to be secretary of defense 
bush was asked if there any plans by the republican party to 
retaliate against house speaker jim wright dtexas who is under 
investigation by a house panel for alleged ethics violations 
i think it would be impossible to do anyway bush said 
and it would be wrong and certainly i would condemn anyone in 
our administration that had any hand in anything of that nature

seigenthaler mr president i apologize i neglected the far 
left some would say it was out of character with me but 
laughter 
bush note that he said that not i 
go ahead 
q lou ureneck portland pressherald mr president i live and 
work in a state with a 2500 mile coast line a coast line that 
includes an oil terminal as well as the village of kennebunkport 
im wondering why it took so long for the government to move on the 
alaskan oil spill why didnt the government the federal 
government move more boldly more quickly to clean up the spill 
bush i think the federal government moved much more quickly and 
more boldly than it gets credit for 
i consider the united states coast guard a part of the united 
states government 
and the coast guard moved very rapidly 
what we did not want to do and i am convinced now even in 
retrospect that this decision is correct was to relieve the exxon 
corporation of its liability by federalizing 
and when i promptly sent our able epa administrator and our 
head of the coast guard admiral yost and sam skinner the 
secretary of transportation up there they came back with the 
unanimous recommendation that federalizing wasnt appropriate 
the federal assets we have moved forward now on the cleanup 
the first was containment and now its mainly in the cleanup 
phase although there still are some containment problems 
subsequently and maybe i should accept some criticism on 
whether i should have done this a week before we did or something 
of that nature of giving you the reasons 
but i think that the federal government is properly involved but 
should not we should not have done what some are urging upon us 
federalize that whole cleanup 
and you know its a tough one 
i do know the corner of the maine coast youre talking about and 
something about the pristine nature of prince william sound 
and i do have a great concern about the environment 
i want to do better 
i want to do better and set higher standards in the environment 
but i also happen to believe that the national security needs of 
this country are served by having production offshore and by 
producing oil from the north slope 
and it is awful hard to guarantee against a contingency in a 
10mile where in a 10milewide channel after thousands and 
thousands and thousands put it millions barrels have gone 
through there safely and now apparently what human error seems 
to have caused this aberration 
its hard to have a contingency plan against that 
and the other day they asked me about that and said well 
you know because there were some saying well you ought to shut 
down the oil coming out of prince william sound coming through 
you know around the port of valdez 
and i said well to guarantee against what happened should 
we shut down all the production off of louisiana and texas 
im not sure i understand the difference 
and i think we have got to do everything we can to learn from 
this 
weve got to do everything we can to have a plan that is based 
not on a third of the spill but on the totality of this spill in 
terms of in terms of recovery 
but i simply do not want this disaster to this isnt on your 
question but projecting a little to weaken the national security 
interests by making us further and further dependent on foreign oil 
were about up to 50 percent now and that is not a good enough 
standard

the secretary general of the north atlantic 
treaty organization challenged warsaw pact nations wednesday to 
begin reducing their shortrange nuclear weapon strength if they 
are interested in talks with the west on the subject 
manfred woerner made the comment after meeting with president 
bush and advisers at the white house concerning nato strategy 
eastwest relations and preparations for the nato summit may 2930 
in brussels belgium which bush will attend 
warsaw pact ministers meeting in east berlin on tuesday called 
for negotiations with nato on tactical shortrange nuclear weapons 
this is no news they have repeatedly stated such 
intentions woerner told reporters 
i would call to your attention that they have 14 times more 
shortrange weapons than we have he said it would be a good 
idea if they are interested to reduce and start to build down 
their shortrange nuclear weapons 
a white house statement said bush and woerner met for half an 
hour it said they discussed nato summit preparations the 
continuing validity of nato strategy and developments in the soviet 
union and eastern europe 
the president emphasized the success of the alliance in 
keeping the peace and promoting prosperity for 40 years and his 
desire that their may summit project a broad vision of the 
alliances future the statement said 
secretary of state james a baker iii national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and white house chief of staff john sununu attended 
the meeting 
the suggestion in east berlin came in a speech by polish foreign 
minister tadeusz olechowski who said the warsaw pact ministers had 
agreed that progress in the vienna conventional arms talks last 
month should be broadened to include the start of negotiations on 
tactical nuclear weapons 
woerner said he and bush discussed a broad range of 
disarmament questions including conventional arms 
the first part of course is to get the soviets to agree to 
our proposal reduce come down to lower levels and equal ceilings 
and then of course the president as much as nato is interested to 
consider further steps but first let us come and make a success 
out of our proposal he said

secretary of state james a baker iii asked 
congress on wednesday to quickly approve a 497 million bipartisan 
aid plan for the contra rebels to set up an acid test of the 
willingness of nicaraguas sandinista government and its soviet 
allies to support the peace process 
the house appropriations committee voted 3210 to recommend the 
compromise plan be adopted the senate appropriations panel 
approved it 184 
the proposal which could reach the house floor by thursday is 
likely to be approved by both chambers putting at least a 
temporary end to years of controversy and divisiveness over former 
president reagans policy of arming the contras 
baker said the new arrangement to maintain the contras with 
clothing food medical suplies and other nonmilitary aid will 
put the united states back in the ballgame in central america 
up to now we have been out of the ballgame because we had the 
legislature going in one direction and the executive going in 
another direction and we couldnt function baker told the senate 
appropriations foreign operations subcommittee 
today for the first time we have an opportunity to speak 
with one voice to the people of central america 
baker said the plan will focus international attention on the 
sendinistas and make clear whether or not they will keep the 
promises made when nicaraguas daniel ortega and the other central 
american presidents signed the esquipulas accord in august 1987 
between now and february 1990 when elections are scheduled in 
nicaragua the whole world will know the answer to this question 
do the sandinistas keep their word baker said 
he said that question will be answered by whether or not the 
sandinistas negotiate fair election rules permit the return of the 
contras with safety under democratic conditions and stop supporting 
marxist guerrillas in el salvador 
their record is abysmal they have not kept any of their 
promises baker said of the sandinistas but we do have an 
opportunity now to focus world opinion on their willingness to keep 
their promises 
baker noted the soviets have said they support the esquipulas 
agreement 
now we will have an opportunity to see if they really do he 
said we will see if there is any meat on the bones of new 
thinking as far as their goals in central america are concerned 
baker said the soviet union uses nicaragua as a dumping 
ground for 515 million in military aid a year and noted that the 
last us arms aid to the contras expired in the spring of 1988 
there was some grumbling by republicans that the terms of the 
agreement permit the democraticcontrolled house and senate to cut 
off the flow of aid to the contras after seven months if congress 
sees fit 
baker said the agreement represents the best opportunity to 
forge a unified us policy he said nothing in it bars the bush 
administration from seeking renewed military aid for the contras if 
that seems justified by events 
but sen patrick leahy dvt said that for all practical 
purposes the bipartisan agreement cancels the policy of using the 
contras as surrogate fighters for the united state in central 
america 
i think this is a historic moment leahy said i think 
both sides now realize that the contra war is at an end

so lets learn from this 
lets do better in protecting the environment 
let if theres a lesson here that one agency or another might 
have moved faster i will be the first to learn from that 
but weve got to keep a certain perspective 
and i am very pleased that the federal government is as 
involved as it should be now 
i also would like to see more volunteers involved 
and therein i would make a pitch for strong support for 
revision of our liability laws 
some i am told volunteers are and volunteer groups are kept 
from from helping out maybe not on this one but in many other 
areas because of the fear of outrageous liability claims 
so this is a good we can maybe learn this from that much 
from this this disaster up there 
but i dont i think maybe we should take some blame but not 
i think i think weve had prudent action and i hope its been 
timely 
seigenthaler theres time for only one more question in order 
to grant equity well give it to the gentlemen whove been on 
their feet the longest 
q mr president inaudible southern california when the 
north trial is over will you tell the american people if you were 
the socalled discreet emissary sent to honduras during the 
irancontra affair and if you were give a full accounting of what 
you did there 
bush i think ive given a full accounting 
i would refer you sir to what incidentally in todays 
paper to what was said by ambassador negroponte and also tony 
motley who sat in on that meeting 
and having said that every attorney that advises the president 
has advised me not to do something that inadvertently would cause a 
mistrial or would disturb the process that is under way 
and so i i dont like reading charges that i happen to feel 
are untrue but i have to stand on that and that just goes with 
the territory 
and i am confident that the process that has gone on and the 
process that undoubtedly will go on after this trial is over will 
will say that anything i have heretofore said is correct 
but i do not want to be pushed into doing something for 
selfaggrandizement that would be would be ruled by some judge to 
to have aborted a trial that is under way 
well thank you all very much applause 
seigenthaler mr president mr president i applause 
mr president im sure applause mr president im sure you 
know that there is overwhelming support for those ethics proposals 
you put forward today i would only hope first of all thank you 
for your generous time i hope you will treat this forum the 
american society of newspaper editors as an annual place where you 
can come and provide us with additional proposals throughout your 
administration we are in your debt the president and his party 
will leave will the members of the society please remain in their 
seats applause

attorneys for impeached judge alcee l 
hastings pleaded wednesday for up to 950000 from the government 
to finance his fight to stay on the bench but they encountered a 
cool reception from senators 
youre making an unprecedented request for compensation which 
just speaking for myself i dont think youre going to have 
available sen arlen spector rpa told hastings attorney 
terence j anderson 
the house on aug 3 approved 4133 articles of impeachment 
accusing the 52yearold district court judge of conspiring to 
obtain a bribe in 1981 and lying about it in 1983 before a jury 
that eventually acquitted him 
one impeachment article also accuses hastings the first black 
federal judge in florida history of improperly disclosing secret 
wiretap information and as a result torpedoing a federal 
investigation 
hastings says he knew nothing of any plot he claims it stemmed 
from an idle boast by a friend and onetime classmate washington 
attorney william borders that he could influence the judges 
actions 
borders described in a house committee report as politically 
influential in the late 1970s was convicted of conspiracy and 
imprisoned after accepting a garment bag stuffed with 125000 in 
cash from an fbi undercover agent 
a 12member senate panel is preparing to hear evidence based on 
its report the full senate will then vote on whether to remove 
hastings from the bench and halt payment of his 89500 salary 
anderson said he is unsure if he will call on borders who has 
grounds to fear that he will be murdered if he testifies 
anderson said he based that statement on talks with borders 
attorney and others the cast of the case is spiced with shady 
characters including florida mob boss santo trafficante and a 
miami antique dealer who kept the fbi informed borders plans in 
return for lenient treatment on a narcotics charge 
anderson asked the senate panel for 200000 in expenses as well 
as unspecified fees which he said at a fair rate of compensation 
could add up to 750000 he said that even though hastings is 
well paid as a judge he is indigent for purposes of the 
impeachment trial because his salary is not enough to pay the high 
costs 
anderson said that as a law professor at miami university he 
could afford to take the summer off and work on the hastings case 
but he said that without government funding cocounsel patricia 
williams would be committing economic suicide to devote full 
time to the trial to the neglect of her law practice 
after presenting his case to the lawmakers however anderson 
was not overly optimistic i felt an awful lot like the train is 
continuing to run down the track he told reporters afterward 
the attorney also asked for a 180day delay in the start of 
hearing evidence saying he needs time to question potential 
witnesses the list includes former us chief justice warren 
burger and current chief justice william rehnquist 
in addition anderson asked the senators to force the house to 
provide him with an array of documents ranging from working papers 
produced by the prosecution to justice department and fbi 
investigative files 
the lawmakers went into closed session to deliberate following 
the hearing and the chairman sen jeff bingaman dnm said it 
might have decisions to announce later in the week 
prosecutors from the house of representatives urged the senators 
to turn down the request for more documents rep john bryant 
dtexas said the house already had provided the defense with 
numerous documents and offered to work with anderson to duplicate 
others 
he said however that it was unreasonable for anderson to 
request every single document that we ever reviewed even if 
the house complied he said it would be of little benefit to the 
defense 
he knows very well that we have no documents that exonerate 
the defendant bryant said if we did why on earth would we be 
here we have had no desire to spend the last three years working 
on this matter 
bryant urged the senators not to delay the start of hearing 
evidence and instead begin around june 1 he said the house would 
take no position on whether to provide government money to wage 
hastings legal battle 
rep george w gekas rpa however did express concern about 
defense plans to question burger rehnquist and a wide array of 
other witnesses if granted the delay it seeks 
we find that all of this evidence that none of it is relevant 
to the facts that must be presented to this committee gekas said

a cold front brought relief wednesday from dense 
smoke that had choked south florida when wildfires spread through 
about 32000 acres of dry sawgrass 
smoke from the brushfires which had enveloped metropolitan 
miami cleared considerably and forecasters said the haze wasnt 
expected to return 
meanwhile increased humidity and lighter winds helped 
firefighters control the blazes according to seb farina spokesman 
for the state division of forestry 
two major fires in dade county were contained overnight with 
only hot spots and some flareups being battled officials said 
in all 27000 acres have burned in dade and another 5000 acres 
in palm beach county 
there had been particular concern about one fire that appeared 
headed toward the everglades national park but spokeswoman pat 
tolle said the closest the 18000acre fire got was about 45 miles 
from the park boundary 
on tuesday smoke from the fires made it difficult for some 
workers in downtown miami to see biscayne bay a few blocks away it 
also forced the evacuation of nearly 750 immigrants from a 
detention facility that was overwhelmed by the choking haze 
the detained aliens were bused back to the krome avenue 
detention center on wednesday according to perry rivkind district 
director of the us immigration and naturalization service 
we expected it to clear mostly overnight and it practically 
has said wayne colin a forecaster for the national weather 
service we had a cold front come through and wind directions 
changed 
some of the lingering smoke blew further south producing hazy 
conditions and acrid air down to key west but dr jose bofill of 
the monroe county health unit described it as a very very mild 
situation we have some smoke and you can smell it

americans considering a trek across the 
united statesmexico border should not be dissuaded by the gruesome 
discovery of 12 people slaughtered in satanic rituals officials 
said wednesday 
we do not believe there is any danger to people traveling to 
matamoros said texas attorney general jim mattox 
members of a voodoo cult of drug smugglers arrested in at least 
12 ritual slayings including a us college student said 
wednesday they sacrificed their victims for demonic protection from 
police 
the us state department was monitoring the situation 
officials said 
we do not issue travel advisories in connection with isolated 
criminal acts said frances jones spokeswoman for consular 
affairs at the state department in washington 
last year more than 118 million people crossed the united 
statesmexico border according to charles conroy public affairs 
officer for the us customs service 
of those about 45 million were american pedestrians crossing 
from brownsville texas into matamoros where authorities 
discovered the mutilated body on tuesday 
thousands of americans come over for food shopping or drinking 
excursions restaurants bars and curio shops dot obregon street 
along the first mile into the city 
authorities wednesday were quick to say the mass killing should 
not alarm potential tourists 
arturo moreno supervisor at the brownsville station of the us 
border patrol said it could not be determined whether the killings 
indicate tourists are in danger 
we always tell people to travel with caution and stay in the 
tourists area moreno said 
residents of matamoros said they hope they can ward off a stigma 
that could be attached to their city because of the slayings 
we are very concerned and we will tell the tourists that 999 
percent of the people here are good and that it only takes one or 
two to give the others the bad name said ignacio garcia a shift 
supervisor at pancho villas restaurant on wednesday 
it was the second drugrelated mass killing discovered near the

a state department official said wednesday 
that angolan rebels had committed human rights abuses but told 
congress the united states would continue to back them 
no doubt hey abuses are taking place they are on both 
sides e gibson lanpher the departments director of southern 
african affairs responded under sharp questioning by democrats 
howard wolpe and stephen solarz 
but he added that continued us support for unita and 
national reconciliation inside angola are essential to ensure an 
end to the countrys 14year civil war 
the rebel union for the total independence of angola unita has 
proposed talks with the angolan government on a peace accord and 
powersharing he said and the government also is coming to 
realize such a need 
lanphers comments came at a hearing convened by the house 
ssubcommittee on africa to debate us policy in angola in the wake 
of the cuban troop pullout that began earlier this year 
in a related development the house adopted an amendment that 
would withhold the us contribution to un peacekeeping activity 
in angola unless all cuban troops are withdrawn from that country 
according to the stipulations of a usmediated agreement signed 
last december 
rep gerald solomon a new york republican who introduced the 
measure said it would require the president to report to congress 
periodically on the progress of the withdrawal of an estimated 
40000 cuban troops 
solomons amendment reflects the distrust felt by many 
republicans in congress about the intentions of cuba and its ally 
the angolan government 
representative dan burton ranking minority member of the africa 
subcommittee accused the angolan government of using chemical 
weapons against rebels he said allegations against unita of gross 
human rights abuses are part of an angolan campaign to discredit 
the organization and stop the us covert support begun in 1985 
us aid is estimated at 15 million to 40 million 
human rights watch an american monitoring group recommended to 
congress that us aid to unita be stopped in light of evidence 
showing a practice of gross abuses of human rights 
a justreleased report by the organization blames both unita and 
the angolan government for systematic and indiscriminate attacks on 
civilians and charges unita with forcible conscription of 
civilians taking hundreds of foreigners hostage and using food as 
a starvation weapon 
lanpher said the united states does not have any evidence to 
substantiate accusations leveled in recent months by former unita 
members that their families have been burned to death because they 
practiced witchcraft 
solarz a member of the house intelligence committee which 
monitors the covert aid to angola urged lanpher to investigate the 
allegations i cant imagine the american people want to 
subsidize a movement that burns witches at the stake he said 
we got over that several hundred years ago at salem

a supersonic concorde jet carrying 100 
americans dropped a chunk of its tail over the south pacific 
wednesday during an attempt to set a speed record but it landed 
safely and passengers were reported eager to try again 
the 9foot tail section of the british airways plane ripped off 
about 25 minutes after the plane left christchurch new zealand 
for sydney 1000 miles away passengers said the plane shuddered 
but the craft landed in sydney about an hour later no one was 
injured 
the plane is attempting to set speed records for each of 12 
parts of a threeweek journey around the world the passengers who 
included commentator william f buckley jr each paid 39000 for 
the trip which began in london on april 1 
peter stanton an airline spokesman said part of the rudder 
disintegrated while the jet was flying at 40000 feet at about 
1500 mph nearly twice the speed of sound 
it experienced a shudder while over the tasman sea that was 
thought to have been air turbulence said stanton but it was a 
normal landing there was no emergency 
he said the control tower told the pilot capt david leney 
that a piece of the tail was missing 
it wasnt until we got out of the plane and saw the firetrucks 
and all the press that we knew something was wrong buckley 
later told abcs good morning america 
about 25 minutes after takeoff from new zealand there was a 
large thump freelance journalist sheila colenilva told the 
associated press everybody looked at everybody else and lunch 
was served the stewardesses looked terrified 
the pilot came on and said there was nothing to worry about 
and that there was a piece loose on the airplane 
investigators began analyzing the concordes flight data 
recorder to find out why the tail section broke off british 
airways airport service manager pat boody said the crew noticed 
unusual vibrations during the flight 
buckley who helped organize the trip planned to broadcast his 
television show firing line during stops in cape town south 
africa and sydney other stops on the itinerary include acapulco 
mexico colombo sri lanka and mombassa kenya the trip was 
scheduled to end april 23 in london

the trip and that none had asked to leave the tour 
ms colenilva said they cant wait to get back on board

said the trip would cover 38343 miles its the first ever 
supersonic circumnavigation of the earth she said 
a prototype of the anglofrench concorde first flew 20 years 
ago it has been in commercial service since 1976 but mainly on 
transatlantic routes 
an airline spokesman in london said a spare part was being sent 
but it was not known if the plane could be repaired in time to make 
its scheduled flight friday to perth in western australia the 
airline gave no details on how much of the tail needed to be 
replaced

air france concordes 
concordes have been involved in a number of minor incidents but 
there have been no fatal accidents

attorney general dick thornburgh on wednesday 
revoked a regulation promulgated by his predecessor that required 
the justice department to appoint independent counsels to 
investigate members of congress 
thornburgh who had previously expressed doubt about the order 
issued last summer as a parting shot by outgoing attorney general 
edwin meese iii rescinded the regulation after president bush 
proposed legislation to place lawmakers under the jurisdiction of 
the special prosecutor law 
thornburghs action returns to the justice department at least 
while congress studies the legislation its traditional role in 
investigating allegations of criminal wrongdoing by members of 
congress 
the congress has been asked to review the role of the 
independent counsel thornburgh said in a statement 
until that review is completed the previously established 
system for handling allegations of wrongdoing by members of 
congress which has worked well for many years will be followed 
the order was issued hours after bush proposed in his ethics 
package to extend to members of congress the law providing for 
court appointment of independent counsels to investigate high 
government officials 
the law currently applies only to highranking executive branch 
officials based on the presumption the justice department would 
have a conflictofinterest when called upon to investigate 
allegations against administration officials 
critics of the law which included former white house officials 
prosecuted under it contend it should also apply to members of 
congress 
meese himself the target of two independent counsel 
investigations that yielded no charges promulgated the regulation 
requiring that the attorney general appoint special prosecutors to 
investigate wrongdoing by member of congress 
thornburghs order means the public integrity section will have 
complete jurisdiction to investigate payroll padding allegations 
against walter fauntroy the nonvoting delegate from the district 
of columbia 
the justice department noted that since the public integrity 
section of the criminal division was established in 1976 20 
members of congress have been convicted of federal crimes 
the department is investigating allegations that fauntroy 
employed the son of rep gus savage dill on his house payroll 
while the younger savage was actually living in chicago 
it would also mean that pending any action by congress on 
bushs proposal the department would have jurisdiction to 
investigate any allegations of wrongdoing against house speaker jim 
wright dtexas 
justice department spokesman loye miller said the public 
integrity section is awaiting the results of the house ethics 
committee it will review the panels report to determine if a 
further investigation is warranted

senators began amending president bushs 
savings and loan bailout plan wednesday with an aim of finishing 
their changes in one day but like their house colleagues quickly 
fell into disagreement over how soon sampl owners should be made to 
put up more of their own money to stay in business 
the senate banking committee was expected to divide along party 
lines with the 12 democrats outvoting their nine republican 
colleagues to reject bushs proposal to not include in the federal 
budget the immediate 50 billion taxpayer cost of the bailout 
treasury secretary nicholas brady in a letter wednesday to the 
panels chairman sen donald riegle dmich did not repeat his 
earlier threat to recommend that bush veto the package if the 50 
billion bailout cost is included in the fiscal 1989 budget 
but in commmending as on balance meritorious proposed 
senate changes in the new tougher regulations and capital 
requirements that bush would impose on the industry brady said the 
administration still opposes riegles plan to reflect the cost of 
the bailout now rather than over 30 years 
rep charles schumer dny the chief advocate in the house of 
such a plan said he is holding off on proposing it after receiving 
a letter wednesday from white house budget director richard darman 
who said he would refuse to count all of the spending in 1989 
if darman carried out the threat it would wreak havoc on 
efforts to meet the grammrudman budget deficit targets in 1990 and 
1991 schumer said darman has the sole power to make that decision 
but said he was still looking for a way to circumvent him 
riege said his plan would avoid the accounting and budget 
gimmickry of bushs proposal by reducing the interest costs of 
financing the bailout through direct treasury borrowing at a 
savings of 45 billion to taxpayers over the next three decades 
utah sen jake garn the committees ranking republican said he 
still has a fundamental disagreement over allowing the bailout 
costs to swell the federal deficit in apparent violation of a 
congressionally mandated reduction target that already has been 
exceeded 
all three versions bushs the senate panels and one being 
put together in the house banking committees financial 
institutions subcommitee would use the 50 billion over the next 
three years to pay for the bailouts of some 200 insolvent sampls in 
1988 plus 350 more that are insolvent or nearly so 
they also provide for an additional 33 billion 300 million a 
year of it coming from the industry to take care of thrift 
insolvencies expected in the 1990s especially if interest rates 
continue to rise or the nation falls into a recession 
the president asked us to move quickly and thats what weve 
done riegle said weve given him a strong bill with many 
streamlined reforms and changes that can prevent in the future a 
repeat of whats happened in the past 
unlike changes made by the house subcommittee the senate 
panels version retains bushs proposal to double by june 1991 the 
required capital that sampl operators must have to qualify for 
federal deposit insurance 
bush would not shut down institutions that fail to meet that 
standard then but he would prevent them from growing both senate 
and house versions would allow undercapitalized thrifts to continue 
growing but would restrict that growth primarily to home mortgages 
and consumer loans 
the house panel which finished its third full day of drafting 
the bill rejected bushs measure to make sampls have the same 
minimum capital requirements as banks 6 for every 100 of 
outstanding loans voting 2423 tuesday to keep the current floor 
3 for every 100 in loans but requiring for the first time 
that half that amount be in real money 
both panels however have voted to phase out many of what 
critics call smoke and mirrors accounting fictions 
those accounting practices have allowed sampls to escape putting 
up their own cash or retained earnings by counting as capital such 
items as investments in nonthrift subsidiaries good will 
their own borrowings and even losses on bad loans 
bush would immediatly end many such bookkeeping practices 
by a 2716 vote wednesday the house subcommittee voted to 
continue allowing sampls to funnel depositors fund into subsidiaries 
to invest in risky areas such as commercial real estate 
development fast food franchises and junk bonds 
the senate panels version would phase out such practices over 
five years but there were disagreements among senators over whether 
to do it in equal yearly installments or all at once 
the house panel also approved wednesday a measure by its 
chairman rep frank annunzio dnj requiring sampls to 
concentrate 80 percent of their lending on residential mortgages 
compared with the 60 percent now required 
but the measure also broadly defines housing to include 
consumer education and small business loans and no sampl would be 
penalized if the mix of its current loan portfolio does not meet 
the requirement 
the subcommittee also approved 3412 a measure sponsored by 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the full committee 
which would require the government to offer some of the repossessed 
property from failed sampls for housing poor people it authorizes 
spending 574 million to subsidize rents on the properties or offer 
discounts or lowinterest loans to purchasers 
it adopted another measure by voice vote imposing government 
oversight on the agency in charge of selling repossessed real 
estate and establishing procedures designed to guard against the 
dumping of the property at firesale prices

the judicial branch 
his proposed bill also would abolish compartmentalization of 
the various agencies of the executive branch for purposes of 
lobbying that means that executive branch workers currently 
barred for a year from lobbying their former office once they leave

the departments of the executive branch

<TEXT>
the independent counsel statute that has been invoked to 
authorize investigations of members of the executive branch would 
be extended to cover the congress 
</TEXT>

a judicial commission investigating 
toplevel corruption linked five cabinet ministers to a 
blackmarket car racket according to a report published thursday 
one minister quit hours earlier 
the report said that of six ministers quizzed in a twomonth 
inquiry headed by judge wilson sandura only foreign minister 
nathan shamuyarira was cleared of wrongdoing 
senior cabinet minister maurice nyagumbo a staunch ally of 
president robert mugabe resigned his post on wednesday hours 
before the report was made public 
two of mugabes top aides defense minister enos nkala and 
political affairs minister frederick shava quit the government and 
the ruling zimbabwe african national union patriotic front party 
after lying to the commission 
but sanduras threemember commission said higher education 
minister dzingai mutumbuka should be prosecuted industry and 
technology minister callistus ndlovu evidently lied in his 
testimony and doubts exist about nyagumbos evidence 
the commission also recommended that matabeleland north gov 
jacob muzenda be prosecuted but it exonerated army commander gen 
tapfumaneyi mujuru 
the commission sent its report to mugabe two weeks ago after 
interrogating 60 witnesses it is zimbabwes biggest political 
scandal in nine years of independence 
mugabe ordered the probe after a provincial newspaper exposed 
the racket in december he promised the full report would be made 
public 
while identifying abuses of power position and privileges in 
the leadership the inquiry also won mugabe praise for ordering 
some of his closest aides to face the embarrassment of being 
quizzed under the public spotlight 
nyagumbo 64 is a staunch ally of mugabe a veteran nationalist 
and a founder of the government party the nations only legal 
party in which he holds the thirdhighest position 
zimbabwe tv gave no explanation in announcing nyagumbos 
resignation but aides speaking on condition of anonymity linked 
it to the corruption scandal and said mugabe is expected to make an 
announcement this week about changes in government 
the probe that shook africas youngest nation was into purchases 
of cars and trucks from willowvale car assembly plant by ministers 
and their friends at low fixed prices 
highranking officials allegedly used their influence to jump 
waiting lines for vehicles and then resell them illegally on the 
black market for up to five times what they paid 
zimbabwe has suffered a severe shortage of cars because it lacks 
hard currency wouldbe buyers may wait up to 10 years for a new 
vehicle 
nyagumbo admitted helping 38 friends buy cars but insisted he 
took no money in return 
the report said it was difficult to believe he received no 
benefits at all 
the commission disputed the testimony of four other ministers 
who testified they bought cars but sold them at the statutory price 
charges being considered range from price control violations and 
sales tax evasion which usually involve nominal fines to perjury 
which carries a maximum prison sentence of five years 
the commission praised geoff nyarota the crusading editor who 
spotlighted what became known as willowgate

president mikhail s gorbachev appealed wednesday 
for calm in soviet georgia but rejected the demands of local 
nationalists and blamed them for igniting lethal strife he said had 
damaged his drive for reform 
the interests of the working people have nothing in common 
with attempts to sever the existing ties of friendship and 
cooperation among our peoples to dismantle the socialist system 
in the republic and push it into the slough of ethnic enmity 
gorbachev said 
they were the soviet leaders first direct public remarks on the 
unrest since at least 19 people were killed sunday in a clash 
between proindependence activists and security forces 
the official tass news agency carried excerpts of gorbachevs 
remarks it said his appeal was published in tbilisi the georgian 
capital and the site of sundays clash 
the summary of gorbachevs remarks blamed actions by 
irresponsible persons for the loss of life apparently 
exonerating soldiers and police from any official blame 
in the city of 12 million 900 miles south of moscow strikes 
continued and funeral services were planned for those killed the 
georgian communist party chief tendered his resignation a soviet 
spokesman said 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze an ethnic georgian met 
with almost 200 georgian nationalists human rights activists and 
strike organizers in tbilisi trying to establish concord but the 
wednesday meeting ended after nearly three hours when many 
participants walked out moscow activist alexander podrabinek 
reported 
podrabinek said two speakers demanded a special session of 
georgias parliament to consider secession from the soviet union 
he identified them as karlo bardavelidze from the opposition 
national democratic party and irakli shengelaya from the union of 
national justice a group of georgian writers and other 
intellectuals 
shevardnadze only repeated commonplaces about perestroika 
gorbachevs program for national restructuring podrabinek said 
he said student strike organizers and national democratic party 
organizers were among many to quit the meeting at the filmworkers 
union building viewing it as fruitless 
zurav zhankarashvili a tbilisi resident and member of the 
georgian human rights watchdog organization helsinki watch called 
gorbachevs appeal very dry and expressed doubts it would be 
enough to ease tensions 
gorbachev also made a personal appeal for calm in february 1988 
after ethnic strife occurred in armenia and azerbaijan his call 
only momentarily stemmed bloodshed in those republics where more 
than 90 people were killed last year 
demonstrations in georgia began april 4 
the trouble started when protesters criticized calls from 
members of the republics ethnic abkhazian minority to break away 
because of alleged discrimination by georgians 
other protesters demanded georgia secede from the soviet union 
because of alleged interference from the central government and 
russians in the republics political economic and cultural affairs 
gorbachev appeared to reject both breakaway demands saying 
reshaping ethnic relations is not recarving borders and not 
breaking the countrys nationalstate structure 
led by gorbachev the supreme soviet presidium the nations top 
executive body also refused armenian demands last year to annex a 
mostly armenian region of azerbaijan it was that issue that led to 
bloodshed between those republics 
gorbachev said the disturbances in tbilisi had damaged the 
interests of perestroika democratization and renewal in the 
country 
foreign reporters have been barred from traveling to georgia 
but residents of tbilisi reached by telephone said the protesters 
were killed when soldiers charged an unarmed proindependence crowd 
that massed near the government house before dawn sunday 
the foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told 
reporters in moscow on wednesday that a girl injured in the melee 
had died which he said brought the total number of civilian deaths 
to 19 
however the evening government newspaper izvestia put the death 
toll at 20 earlier reports said 75 soldiers and police were hurt 
but pravda said wednesday 91 police and soldiers were injured no 
reason for the change was given 
gerasimov said the first funerals will be held thursday tuesday 
was declared an official day of mourning for georgias dead 
gerasimov also said georgian party chief dzhumber patiashvili 
asked to be relieved of his duties at a meeting of georgian 
party leaders tuesday night but will keep his post until the party 
decides his fate 
gerasimov said patiashvili offered to resign after widespread 
criticism from other georgian leaders he did not specify what 
prompted those complaints signs posted at tbilisi state university 
on sunday blamed patiashvili for the protesters deaths and called 
him a killer residents reported

four guerrillas reported on wednesday 
to a checkpoint established under a un plan to stop fierce 
fighting with south africanled forces police said other 
insurgents moved deeper into the territory 
nine un assembly points were set up tuesday in an effort to 
move guerrillas who had infiltrated into namibia back to 
neighboring angola they had used bases in angola while trying to 
oust south africa from the territory the latest fighting broke out 
april 1 the first day of a yearlong process to make namibia 
independent 
at un headquarters in new york the guerrillas on wednesday 
attacked south africa with words accusing it and the united states 
of hiding advance knowledge of the infiltration in a bid to justify 
an attack on the insurgents 
this was a premeditated and orchestrated ambush for south 
africa to find the pretext to jump out of the commitment to 
cooperate with the un independence plan said theoben gurirab 
foreign secretary of the south west africa peoples organization 
known as swapo 
gurirab said south africa had advance knowledge of the 
infiltration through us aerial reconnaissance photographs he 
said the south africans contrived the situation to persuade british 
prime minister margaret thatcher who was visiting namibia on april 
1 that swapo had broken the ceasefire agreement 
us and south african officials had no immediate response 
gurirab said swapo leader sam nujoma had ordered the guerrillas 
into namibia to surrender to un officials and move into camps 
however no un military observers were in northern namibia at the 
time 
south africa says about 1900 guerrillas infiltrated into 
northern namibia starting april 1 un investigators agree the 
guerrillas violated a peace accord requiring they stay in angolan 
bases at least until may 15 when they could enter the country as 
unarmed refugees 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i last december 
it agreed to begin a transition to independence in exchange for 
cuba withdrawing its estimated 50000 troops from angola 
no major skirmishes have been reported in namibia also known as 
southwest africa since the weekend police say 263 guerrillas and 
27 security force members were killed during the recent fighting 
the four guerrillas arrived wednesday at a un checkpoint at a 
lutheran church in the northern town of oniipa according to an 
associated press photographer at the scene two had arm wounds 
un personnel were called in and took the men to a un camp 38 
miles away at oshikango border un soldiers helped the wounded 
guerrillas from the truck at oshikango and placed them in a tent 
while plans were made to send them across the border to their bases 
in angola 
nujoma last weekend called on his guerrillas to withdraw from 
namibia and the united nations and the security forces agreed to 
arrange assembly points and provide safe passage to angola 
officials in the security forces said they saw tracks of some 
swapo guerrillas heading into angola but there were no reports of 
guerrillas arriving at the un checkpoints until the four on 
wednesday 
security force members and swapo supporters have predicted that 
few guerrillas will report to the un checkpoints because of the 
deployment of security forces there the proximity of military 
bases and poor communication between guerrilla commanders and 
their forces 
police said some guerrillas might try to cross back into angola 
without reporting to the checkpoints and others might hide their 
weapons don civilian clothes and try to stay in namibia 
a police spokesman chief inspector derrick brune said some 
groups of insurgents were seen wednesday moving south away from the 
angola border 
so far only 1721 of 4650 un peacekeepers have reached the 
territory

ap photographer greg english was at a lutheran 
church mission station in northern namibia when word came that four 
swapo guerrillas wanted to turn themselves in to un forces and be 
transported back to angola 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
three pakistani un monitors transported 
four swapo guerrillas in a un vehicle to the angolan border 
wednesday passing through three roadblocks manned by saluting 
south african soldiers unaware of who the passengers were 
the four were picked up by a lutheran missionary from finland 
olle ericsson given medical treatment by an australian medic and 
then carried 38 miles north to oshikango where australian 
engineers raised a un flag tuesday to mark one of the border 
points where the guerrillas could have safe passage into angola 
a un peace plan designed to lead to elections in november and 
to independence for this south africanruled territory was 
endangered april 1 when south africa said hundreds of southwest 
african peoples organization guerrillas had crossed the border 
from angola into northern namibia in a week of fighting 263 swapo 
men and 27 policemen and south african soldiers died 
swapo president sam nujoma asked his men to return to angola 
and the united nations put up blue and white flags at nine assembly 
points in the territory to attract the guerrillas churches were 
made safe havens under an agreement among south africa cuba and 
angola 
however no ceasefire was in effect and south african soldiers 
continued to search vehicles on the road while policemen kept watch 
on churches 
because the unmanned assembly points were set up near south 
african military camps doubts arose as to whether swapo guerrillas 
would venture near them but about 200 churches and mission 
stations exist in northern namibia and they were considered the 
most likely places for the guerrillas to go 
this morning you were all skeptical and said it wouldnt work 
now ive proved you wrong and this is just the beginning a 
jubilant pakistani un military observer said to journalists 
the reporters gathered at the end of the journey at oshikango to 
see the four guerrillas placed in tents and given medical aid by 
australian soldiers 
the pakistani officers identified only as lt col farooq 
capt nadir zeb and capt afafizab indicated the guerrillas would 
not be questioned by the south africans as was suggested wednesday 
by a spokesman for namibias administratorgeneral louis pienaar 
the south africans want to find out from the guerrillas how many 
are leaving 
one swapo guerrilla wounded by shrapnel under his left arm 
arrived at the mission station in the morning and told ericsson he 
had three comrades who wanted to come in ericcson notified un 
monitors at the ondangwa airbase three miles northwest and then 
headed into the bush in a landrover 
he promised the associated press and newsweek photographers at 
the scene he would return 
an hour later he came back with two healthy swapo fighters and 
one with a bullet imbedded under his left arm and scarcely able to 
stand all wore civilian clothes and had ditched their weapons 
local residents gathered around to shake the fighters hands 
one unwounded said he was 38 years old and had lived in exile for 
14 years 
he said he crossed the border on march 31 and fought the next 
day he said he saw one south african soldier or policeman go down 
in battle but when his rifle jammed he threw it away and left 
before he saw what happened to his comrades 
after first aid treatment the pakistani observers loaded the 
guerrillas into a whitepainted un landrover as they traveled 
the road with south african armored personnel carriers driving 
past and brownunifomred soldiers posted at sandbags across the 
highway a pakistani officer said the guerrillas were scared oh 
yes very scared 
by the time they reached oshikango the south african soldiers 
at the military camp there knew who was in the vehicle but did 
nothing as it drove through sand and bushes into the un base 200 
yards away the un soldiers helped the wounded guerrillas from 
the truck and placed them in a tent while plans were made to send 
them across the border to their bases in angola 
if the un plan goes according to schedule a few weeks from 
now they may come back without weapons to settle in namibia and 
vote in unsupervised elections

the senate banking committee on wednesday 
unanimously approved president bushs 90 billion plan for bailing 
out the savings and loan industry after rejecting an effort by the 
panels chairman to dump the 50 billion immediate taxpayer portion 
of the cost onto the 1989 federal budget 
the 21member panel voted 1110 to establish a quasigovernment 
corporation for issuing 30year bonds to finance the governments 
share as bush wanted instead of the onbudget alternative 
advocated by banking committee chairman don riegle dmich 
democratic sens alan cranston of california alan dixon of 
illinois and jim sasser of tennessee sided with all but one of the 
committees nine republicans in favoring bushs plan over riegles 
but riegle himself admitted he had lost enthusiasm for the 
proposal after treasury secretary nicholas brady repeatedly told 
senate democrats throughout wednesday he would recommend that bush 
veto the legislation if it swelled the budget deficit 
sasser who met with brady throughout the day said the 
administrations opposition would have made the effort to solve the 
sampl crisis drag on for months 
the secretary of treasury was absolutely adamant there would 
be a presidentia veto and we would be back to square one sasser 
said 
earlier brady wrote a letter to senators in which he didnt 
repeat the bush veto threat but did say the administration opposed 
riegles plan 
rep charles schumer dny the chief advocate in the house of 
such a plan said he is holding off on proposing it after receiving 
a letter wednesday from white house budget director richard darman 
who said he would refuse to count all of the spending in 1989 
if darman carried out the threat it would wreak havoc on 
efforts to meet the grammrudman budget deficit targets in 1990 and 
1991 schumer said darman has the sole power to make that decision 
but said he was still looking for a way to circumvent him 
riege said his plan would avoid the accounting and budget 
gimmickry of bushs proposal by reducing the interest costs of 
financing the bailout through direct treasury borrowing at a 
savings of 45 billion to taxpayers over the next three decades 
utah sen jake garn the committees ranking republican said he 
still has a fundamental disagreement over allowing the bailout 
costs to swell the federal deficit in apparent violation of a 
congressionally mandated reduction target that already has been 
exceeded 
all three versions bushs the senate panels and one being 
put together in the house banking committees financial 
institutions subcommitee would use the 50 billion over the next 
three years to pay for the bailouts of some 200 insolvent sampls in 
1988 plus 350 more that are insolvent or nearly so 
they also provide for an additional 33 billion 300 million a 
year of it coming from the industry to take care of thrift 
insolvencies expected in the 1990s especially if interest rates 
continue to rise or the nation falls into a recession 
the president asked us to move quickly and thats what weve 
done riegle said weve given him a strong bill with many 
streamlined reforms and changes that can prevent in the future a 
repeat of whats happened in the past 
unlike changes made by the house subcommittee the senate 
panels version retains bushs proposal to double by june 1991 the 
required capital that sampl operators must have to qualify for 
federal deposit insurance 
bush would not shut down institutions that fail to meet that 
standard then but he would prevent them from growing both senate 
and house versions would allow undercapitalized thrifts to continue 
growing but would restrict that growth primarily to home mortgages 
and consumer loans 
the house panel which finished its third full day of drafting 
the bill rejected bushs measure to make sampls have the same 
minimum capital requirements as banks 6 for every 100 of 
outstanding loans voting 2423 tuesday to keep the current floor 
3 for every 100 in loans but requiring for the first time 
that half that amount be in real money 
both panels however have voted to phase out many of what 
critics call smoke and mirrors accounting fictions 
those accounting practices have allowed sampls to escape putting 
up their own cash or retained earnings by counting as capital such 
items as investments in nonthrift subsidiaries good will 
their own borrowings and even losses on bad loans 
bush would immediatly end many such bookkeeping practices 
by a 2716 vote wednesday the house subcommittee voted to 
continue allowing sampls to funnel depositors fund into subsidiaries 
to invest in risky areas such as commercial real estate 
development fast food franchises and junk bonds 
the senate panels version would phase out such practices over 
five years but there were disagreements among senators over whether 
to do it in equal yearly installments or all at once 
the house panel also approved wednesday a measure by its 
chairman rep frank annunzio dnj requiring sampls to 
concentrate 80 percent of their lending on residential mortgages 
compared with the 60 percent now required 
but the measure also broadly defines housing to include 
consumer education and small business loans and no sampl would be 
penalized if the mix of its current loan portfolio does not meet 
the requirement 
the subcommittee also approved 3412 a measure sponsored by 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the full committee 
which would require the government to offer some of the repossessed 
property from failed sampls for housing poor people it authorizes 
spending 574 million to subsidize rents on the properties or offer 
discounts or lowinterest loans to purchasers 
it adopted another measure by voice vote imposing government 
oversight on the agency in charge of selling repossessed real 
estate and establishing procedures designed to guard against the 
dumping of the property at firesale prices

members of a voodoo cult of drug 
smugglers arrested in at least 12 ritual slayings including a 
us college student said wednesday they sacrificed their victims 
to gain demonic protection from police 
police on wednesday night suspended digging at the ranch where 
they found 12 mutilated bodies and said their priority was to find 
a cuban godfather they believe led the bloody cult 
we killed them for protection elio hernandez rivera 22 of 
matamoros told reporters he said at a news conference that he 
shot and killed one victim and decapitated another 
asked if he regretted the slayings he said yes but its too 
late 
very clearly they believed the human sacrifices and the animal 
sacrifices put a magical shield around them that protected them 
from evil or harm even up to bullets said texas attorney 
general jim mattox 
in addition to the university of texas premedical student the 
victims included a matamoros policeman a mexican federal police 
volunteer and a 16yearold mexican and us officials said at 
least one victim was kidnapped in brownsville texas in the last 
month and as many as three of the dead may be american officials 
said 
contrary to officials assertions tuesday oran neck us 
customs chief agent in brownsville just across the rio grande from 
matamoras said wednesday there was no evidence of cannibalism 
felipe flores spokesman for the mexican attorney generals 
office also said he knew nothing about reports of cannibalism 
although he added that victims brains were cut out and put on a 
fire mixed with blood herbs rooster feet goat heads and turtles 
cameron county sheriff alex perez said cult members removed some 
victims vertebrae to use them for necklaces 
suspects in mexican custody told police of 14 human sacrifices 
but no more bodies were found by wednesday night and digging was 
suspended said juan benitez ayala head of the mexican federal 
judicial police 
mexican officials said five men were arrested in the case 
mexican police took four of the men to a news conference 
wednesday and the four said they killed on the command of a cult 
godfather identified by police as adolfo de jesus constanzo a 
cuban national in his late 40s police on both sides of the border 
were seeking him and police said he may have fled to the united 
states with a female cult member 
constanzo killed one of the victims university of texas student 
mark kilroy said another of the arrested men serafin hernandez 
garcia 22 of brownsville 
garcia rivera and the three other men all matamoros residents 
were being detained pending the filing of formal charges of murder 
kidnapping possession of weapons and crimes against the state 
said jose silva arroyo narcotics supervisor for the mexican 
federal judicial police in matamoros 
constanzo apparently introduced a sort of voodoo or black magic 
to the area neck said 
the ritual has overtones of a religious cult that has been 
exported out of cuba and haiti as santeria neck said based on 
feathers and other evidence of rituals found at the ranch and the 
matamoros home of a woman also sought by police 
the mexican attorney generals office said costanzo is believed 
to have fled into the united states mattox said investigators 
believe the cult had 10 members 
the 12 bodies were found tuesday in graves in a field about 20 
miles west of matamoros by mexican officials on a routine drug 
search 
some victims were shot in the head and others appeared to have 
been slain with machetes or sledgehammers neck said authorities 
said they also found candles and kettles full of body parts and 
animal bones 
cult members were importing about 1000 pounds of marijuana a 
month into the united states mattox said 
kilroy a university of texas student vanished march 14 in 
matamoros while on spring break sheriffs lt george gavito said 
kilroy 21 lived for about 12 hours after his abduction and 
was slain with a machete neck said kilroy apparently was chosen 
at random after the cult members were told to pick one anglo male 
that particular night gavito said 
one of the suspects hernandez garcia said kilroy was 
approached by several men 
he was walking and we went up to him and said hey you need 
a ride he said yes he got into the truck and after we got out 
to go to the restroom he started running and then the other guys 
caught up to him hernandez garcia said 
authorities said kilroy was recaptured and taken to the ranch 
and later killed i didnt kill him but the others who killed 
him hit him with a machete hernandez garcia said 
perez said suspects confessed to removing kilroys brain and 
spine and chopping off his legs in some forms of witchcraft 
removal of the brain signifies a sacrifice of the victims soul 
i think they must be possessed by the devil that would be the 
only explanation for what they did kilroys mother helen said 
at a news conference i will pray for them so they will realize 
how wrong all this is 
mark never had any involvement whatsoever in narcotics said 
his father james he never even tried it he was afraid of 
narcotics but yet it was narcotics that killed mark 
when people stand there next to you and try to tell you that 
marijuana cigarettes doesnt hurt theyre wrong marijuana is what 
killed mark these guys were marijuana smugglers he said 
in santa fe texas kilroys hometown a yellow ribbon ceremony 
had been scheduled wednesday to draw attention to kilroys 
disappearance after tuesdays discovery the ceremony was 
designated a memorial service 
it was the third drugrelated mass killing discovered along the 
usmexican border within three weeks 
on march 29 mexican authorities found the bodies of three women 
and six men all tortured and mutilated on an abandoned ranch near 
agua prieta just across the border from douglas ariz mexican and 
us investigators said those slayings were drugrelated 
on march 27 two people from arizona and three from the mexican 
state of sonora were found bound and stabbed in a shed in tucson 
ariz those deaths were also called drugrelated

history made rosetta one of egypts 
bestknown places first as a major seaport for the ottoman empire 
then as the city that gave its name to the rosetta stone which 
yielded the key to ancient hieroglyphics 
but the rosetta of today hardly does justice to its rich past 
few pay any attention to its history and the sardines that once 
gave it wealth vanished 20 years ago victims of the aswan high 
dam 750 miles south 
the town also languishes in worry about a destructive 
mediterranean sea which took away its beach three years ago 
swallowing up summer cabins and now threatening precious 
agricultural land 
rosettas history lingers in 22 ottomanstyle threestory 
houses tucked among new buildings long neglected the houses 
overlook narrow streets shared by horsedrawn carts and 1956 
chevrolets 
this collection of islamic antiquities from the ottoman empire 
is second only to cairos said mohammed elmallah curator of 
the alamasyali house now restored and open as a museum of 
rosettan life in the early 19th century in fact there are more 
old houses here than in cairo 
founded in the ninth century rosetta flourished and faded then 
flourished again by the 17th century it had become one of the most 
important ports between europe and africa 
gypsum figures in a small recently restored military museum 
depict rosettan townfolk pitched bravely in handtohand combat 
against napoleon is troops from his french campaign in the late 
18th century and against british soldiers in 1807 
napoleons soldiers found the rosetta stone in 1799 twenty 
years later jeanfrancois champollion the worlds first 
egyptologist solved the puzzle of ancient heiroglyphic writing 
through texts from the rosetta stone a basalt tablet now housed in 
the british museum in london 
rosettas importance began to diminish after that and by 1819 
it was no longer a major port because a new canal south of rosetta 
diverted nile trade to alexandria 40 miles to the west 
rosetta its treasures and its 80000 people are on hardly any 
tourists itinerary these days 
maybe its because it has no presentable hotels or restaurants 
or because of the disrepair into which most of the onceelegant 
houses have fallen their intricately designed wooden ceilings 
marble baths and harem areas for women left dark and dusty 
the egyptian government however envisions a new future for 
rosetta and it is in tourism 
an anchor of the tourism plan is an oddlooking honeycomb of 
anvilshaped concrete pieces going up along the coast forming a 
seawall to protect the shoreline 
the wall is well along now workers are restoring many of the 
old houses and mosques and plans are in place for hotels and 
restaurants 
theres a lot to see in rosetta said yehia ibrahim 
mohammed a parttime museum employee we have some foreigners 
visiting but theyre mostly architects and islamic art experts 
officials say that only after completion of the seawall will 
they be able to build a summer resort and a modest hotel and 
restaurant 
that might bring the tourists 
local people however hope the wall in stopping sea erosion 
will bring back the sardines 
the aswan high dam had blocked sea erosionresisting silt far 
upstream in the nile and by the 1970s the mediterranean was 
washing away 580 feet of rosettas shoreline every year the lack 
of silt which contained nutrients that attracted the sardines 
already had finished off the fishing industry 
by 1986 at least 70 cabins and a hotel had been inundated at 
rosettas beach 
an alarmed national government contracted with a company owned 
by the nationalist chinese government on taiwan to build the 
31million seawall 
part of the seawall juts into the mediterranean and experts at 
egypts irrigation ministry expect it to act as a baiting ground 
for sardines 
rosetta was famous for its cafes they were built and spread 
around with the sardine wealth said helmy zayed head of the 
rosetta city council people caught sardines during the season 
then spent their money on businesses weddings pilgrimage and 
coffee houses 
we used to have heaps of sardines so many you would lift them 
with spades every single person in our society has been affected 
by the lack of sardines from the fisherman to the truck driver to 
the tradesman 
and so rosetta is waiting for the sardines

in the bland bureaucratic shorthand of the 
government memorandum it sounds routine just another white house 
meeting and by the way the president of the united states chatted 
with his senior advisers about risking impeachment 
that may sound like richard m nixon and the watergate white 
house but it wasnt it was ronald reagan in 1984 on his way to a 
49state reelection landslide the question was whether the 
administration should be secretly soliciting aid for the nicaraguan 
contras from other countries after congress barred us aid 
the story has been spread on the court record at the irancontra 
trial of oliver north with the government attesting to its 
accuracy there is no evidence in that record that any of the 
senior officials on hand found it remarkable that a top aide to the 
president had told him he might be flirting with impeachment 
it does not seem to have alarmed the reagan high command it 
certainly didnt get in the way of the search for aid 
since impeachment is the ultimate political punishment the word 
would seem to be one that would get any presidents attention 
nixon resigned rather than face an impeachment trial in the senate 
this is not to suggest that reagan policy on aid to the contras 
bears comparison with the watergate and coverup scandals that 
drove nixon from office 
but it is striking that the risk of committing an impeachable 
offense was cited by one of the official family at a meeting 
attended by at least 10 other top administration officials 
including george bush and the matter apparently was treated as 
ordinary business 
bush then vice president is quoted in minutes of the meeting 
as having observed that the outside aid would be a problem only if 
the united states were to promise third countries something in 
exchange for their assistance to the contras 
less than a year later bush told the president of honduras that 
us aid to that country was being expedited the court document 
says the speededup aid was in exchange for honduras continuing 
support of the contras but is silent on whether bush made that 
point in his meeting with the foreign leader 
president bush has refused to discuss those disclosures saying 
any comment from him would interfere with the north trial 
it was james a baker iii then the white house chief of staff 
later reagans secretary of the treasury now bushs secretary of 
state who raised the specter of impeachment 
bakers concern seems to have raised no alarm at the meeting on 
june 25 1984 no suggestion that even coming close to impeachable 
conduct might not be a very good idea the consensus was that baker 
was wrong 
so they decided to get a second legal opinion 
according to the governments admission of facts at the north 
trial director of central intelligence william casey told deputies 
at the cia and the state department in midjuly it was time to get 
moving on contra aid from other countries since attorney general 
william french smith had recently concluded that raising the 
funds in this manner would not be an impeachable offense as had 
been suggested at the national security planning group meeting on 
june 25 1984 
minutes of the june 25 meeting were read into the north trial 
record on march 10 when former national security adviser robert 
macfarlane testified that bakers warning had been discussed and 
disputed and that most of those present disagreed with it 
whatever the merits of bakers legal advice the minutes 
indicate that reagan recognized the political peril of promoting 
aid to the contras by other governments in the face of the 
congressional ban on us military aid he was quoted as saying 
that if word of the effort got out well all be hanging by our 
thumbs in front of the white house 
all of that happened during the rose garden phase of 
reagans campaign for a second term the public record of reagans 
day that june 25 shows a meeting with members of his staff a 
meeting with members of his campaign advisory committee and two 
white house speeches 
at one of them on the south lawn the president complained 
about critics of his economic policies every time i hear them 
he said i remember robert frost saying the brain is a 
wonderful organ it starts working the moment you get up in the 
morning and doesnt stop until you get to the office

for more than three years the vatican has been 
seeking to set firmer rules to keep catholic colleges and 
universities toeing the church line sometimes to their chagrin 
that issue comes to a head when a delegation of their presidents 
18 of them confer next week with vatican officials and pope 
john paul ii about the matter 
were hoping to work through some of the ambiguities that need 
to be resolved said the rev joseph a ohare president of new 
yorks fordham university 
its among 232 catholic institutions of higher learning in the 
united states many established by religious orders but now mostly 
governed by independent boards of trustees 
they insist that they uphold their catholic identities in a 
broad sense but that specifying ecclesiastical restraints would 
cloud academic standing and integrity 
church officials have every right to criticize academic 
teaching but to try to apply sanctions in a university is not 
appropriate ohare said in an interview it wouldnt work 
the vaticans congregation for catholic education in 1985 first 
circulated its working paper of suggestions for bishops to 
require adherence of catholic colleges and universities to various 
church criteria 
this stirred wide protests catholic educators said such control 
would undermine standards of academic freedom jeopardize 
accreditation block government aid and destroy many colleges 
both their faculties and student bodies are widely 
interreligious but they maintain they carry on catholic ideals in 
an ecumenical atmosphere of open inquiry into all truth 
responding to their protests the vatican last november issued a 
revised working paper the document that will be under 
consideration at the april 1825 meeting between university 
presidents and vatican officials 
its a much better document with a lot of positive things 
about it says brother raymond l fitz president of the 
university of dayton the nations ninth largest catholic 
university 
however he added in a telephone interview the whole thing 
still needs work to define more clearly the autonomy of a catholic 
university and its academic freedom 
to endanger those qualities would be absolute disaster he 
said adding 
were going to have to make the point that weve been able to 
maintain strong institutional catholic identity and at the same 
time do so in an atmosphere of academic and institutional autonomy 
i think whats going to be persusasive is that weve done so 
well in maintaining both those dimensions were beginning to get 
the message across that we can be catholic and also be real 
universities that have moved into the forefront of american 
intellectual life 
development of the vatican document on higher education is seen 
as part of the popes policies to tighten adherence to church 
positions in the face of secularized cultures 
the new draft provides that no university may have the word 
catholic in its official title without consent of 
ecclesiastical authority which is to insure catholic doctrinal 
teaching and observance at the university and may intervene for 
grave reasons to declare it no longer catholic 
in ways consistent with the different academic disciplines 
teachers will be faithful to catholic doctrine in their research 
and teaching the document says those who teach theological 
subjects as regular teachers must have a mandate from the competent 
ecclesiastical authority 
at the same time the document often qualifies its requirements 
by saying they should be worked out on a consultative basis and 
may vary according to regulations of the institutions and accepted 
academic practices 
the provisions enable universities to dialogue with american 
bishops about the goals said sister alice gallin secretary of 
the association of catholic colleges and universities based in 
washington 
its a more decentralized way of implementation 
she said the first part of the document in setting the general 
goals of catholic universities is something we can live with 
without too much trouble but the second part is potentially 
more troubling 
it lays down socalled norms for catholic institutions a 
word she said can be interpreted as laws she said the 
educators also dont like the document saying bishops could 
intervene in universities 
the problem is sometimes a question of the words used she 
said we all agree that the purpose of a good strong catholic 
university is to remain catholic in purpose 
but weve done very well over the last 200 years and ought to 
be allowed to continue 
ohare in his 1988 presidents report on the catholic 
identity of fordham says it rejects any notion that its 
catholic identity demands a religious test for either faculty or 
students 
he says the churchs influence is present within the 
university even if the university as an institution is outside 
of the jurisdiction of canon law and ecclesiastical authority

mike farrell knew when he took on the role of 
paul gianelli the attorney who defended a new york teenager 
accused of arranging her fathers murder that he wanted to put 
some of himself into the character 
i saw some video tape of him being interviewed said 
farrell best remembered for his mash role as bj hunnicut 
i decided i wasnt going to do an imitation of him i was going 
to create my own character he was very real within the script 
in the abc movie a deadly silence on sunday as in actual 
events on long island ny gianelli defends teenager cheryl 
pierson on a charge that she hired a schoolmate to kill her father 
she contended that she had him killed to stop his sexual abuse 
i met the reporter who wrote the book he said referring to 
dena kleiman of the new york times she was a terrific source of 
information gianelli was a straightforward lawyer whose practice 
was mostly domestic but he had done some corporate work 
the thing that interested me was that on a human level he 
really connected with this girl and became very committed to her 
welfare the more he found about what her life had been like the 
more passionate he became about her case 
kleimans book related cheryls story of her yearslong 
entrapment in an incestuous relationship with her father james 
pierson it probes deeper however to reveal a conspiracy of 
silence by friends and relatives 
pierson was shot to death on feb 5 1986 at his home in 
selden cheryl then 16 was accused of paying a classmate 1000 
to kill him she served 3 months of her 6month sentence 
a deadly silence also stars charles haid as james pierson a 
robust electrician who clung to such trappings of youth as fast 
cars and motorcycles sally struthers as social worker marilyn 
adams bruce weitz as detective james mccready and heather 
fairfield as cheryl john patterson directed from a screenplay by 
jennifer miller for executive producer robert greenwald 
because of the circumstances of cheryls case farrell said 
some people felt she should not serve any time at all but should 
be put on some form of probation she was a person who was trying 
to extricate herself albeit violently from a terrible situation 
she hired a classmate to kill her father her class had 
discussed a story about an abused wife who had hired someone to 
kill her husband she said who would do a thing like that and 
her classmate said he would 
farrell has not been in a series since mash left the air 
in 1983 he had been a journeyman actor before that appearing in 
two other series but it was mash that gave him star power 
he has starred in several unsuccessful pilots however including 
the 1985 moviepilot private sessions in which he played a

television movies and appears in some tv films his production 
partner is marvin minoff they produced the feature film dominick 
and eugene and farrell also directed the tv movie run till you 
fall he starred in memorial day and choices of the heart 
if many of farrells films seem to have messages its no 
accident he is passionately committed to causes 
one is fighting pollution and his next movie the smell of 
money deals with toxic waste he cowrote the story with david 
reiss and albert rubin wrote the screenplay farrell will produce 
and star in the movie for turner network television 
the movies about a man against the system said farrell 
his daughter becomes ill and dies from what he learns is toxic 
waste dumped into a stream by a factory its a onefactory town 
and when he takes on the factory everyone turns on him rather than 
the polluter well shoot it on location in utah 
since 1984 farrell has been married to actress shelley fabares 
who is currently costarring in the abc series coach 
id just come back from el salvador in 1982 and cbs asked me 
to go to their affiliates meeting in san francisco he said

when they shop for home mortgage loans these 
days most borrowers find themselves comparing not only interest 
rates but points 
a point simply defined is 1 percent of the amount of a 
mortgage paid by the borrower to the lender at the time a loan is 
made 
in an era of high interest rates banks and other financial 
institutions have increasingly relied on points as a way of 
maintaining the return they get on their lending activities without 
having to raise their rates to forbidding levels 
for example one new york bank recently offered a oneyear 
adjustable rate mortgage with no points at a starting interest rate 
of 1025 percent 
a competitor meanwhile was touting a oneyear adjustable loan 
with 2 points at 9625 percent 
assuming you could qualify for either which one should you 
choose with adjustable mortgages in particular there are other 
important variables to consider for example caps on interest 
rate increases from year to year and over the life of the loan 
but all other things being equal the choice of a deal with or 
without points would depend on your circumstances as well as its 
mathematical merits 
the higherrate loan for example might appeal to people whose 
assets are stretched to the limit making a minimum down payment on 
a home but who are confident their future earnings will cover 
higher monthly mortgage payments 
conversely someone who is mainly worried about keeping monthly 
costs down might opt for paying points up front to get the lower 
rate 
the burden of paying points historically has been lightened by a 
tax deduction borrowers simply included the amount of any points 
they paid in the mortgageinterest deduction on their tax returns 
but with recent changes in the tax laws the situation is no 
longer quite so simple 
points still qualify for a lumpsump deduction in the year you 
pay them if the charge was incurred as part of the purchase or 
improvement of your primary residence 
otherwise they must be spread out for tax purposes over the 
life of the loan as though they were interest payments made at 
periodic intervals 
and to put them out in plain sight the internal revenue 
services forms now require that deductions for points paid be 
reported on a separate line from mortgage interest 
this poses a problem for people who refinance their houses the 
irss position supported by a recent court ruling is that points 
paid on refinancing dont qualify for a lumpsum deduction unless 
the money is clearly used for home improvements 
the new restrictions can also trip up unwary borrowers at the 
time of purchase if they dont actually pay the points in cash 
unfortunately says william brennan a tax expert at the 
accounting firm of ernst amp whinney many mortgage departments are 
not familiar enough with this rule and automatically suggest adding 
the points to the amount of the loan thus killing the taxpayers 
chance to qualify for current deductibility 
the solution of course is to pay the points from some source 
other than the lending bank brennan observes 
if you do not have the money available you can borrow from 
another bank so as to satisfy the test that you have paid the 
points from your own funds

many companies rushed into it throwing robots at everything but 
lets face it if you automate a mess you still have a mess 
in his view based on experience in modernizing large 
manufacturing facilities to tinker with technology cant possibly 
help what is required he says is the guts to step back and ask 
how would i reinvent this business 
he is serious and concerned which is the reason for speaking 
out weve been losing one market after another to foreign 
competition he says and it would be a lot worse if the weak 
dollar werent helping us abroad 
in washington as well as in many public and private study 
groups the answers being offered are almost always the same 
that we must provide more icnentive to invest in technology 
technology is equated with competitiveness 
it isnt so says leach ive seen production flows so 
complicated they remind you of the flight of the bumble bee 
quality and lead time he says are undercut by excessive movement 
of products through the factory 
instead of changing business from the inside out says leach we 
must start with the marketplace and work back providing added 
value that cannot come from outdated techniques value he says is 
not just price it is quality ease of use availability and 
service to name just some of its elements 
after making the decision to add value he says you must look 
at every element from raw material sourcing through production and 
distribution that is you must think outsidein rather than the 
traditional insideout 
working back from the marketplace you must ask a basic 
question does this activity add value to the endproduct if the 
answer is no you eliminate it the goal he explains is to 
create a smooth logistical pipeline 
that type of thinking at a lockheeds aeronautical systems group 
resulted in a radical simplification of an entire sheet metal 
fabrication process 
results parts that once traveled 2500 feet in the course of 
processing now travel only 150 feet lead time to produce a part 
was cut to two days from 52 quality rose fewer inspections were 
needed inventories were cut 
lockheed did it without a lot of robots or automated guided 
vehicles said leach he conceded that more technology was added 
but only as a set of tools to support simplification 
it isnt easy he says but it is necessary if american 
manufacturers are to become truly competitive so far he isnt 
convinced that they are 
if a manager wants to break with tradition he has to link all 
the corporate fiefdoms that have evolved over the years he 
states the walls between these islands of confusion must be 
broken down we have to get people talking with each other at the 
earliest stages of product development 
in a traditional company he continues designers work on their 
own then throw a design over the walls to engineering 
manufacturing and marketing they in turn throw it back eating up 
precious development time 
in contrast at a competitive company teams of designers 
engineers and manufacturers focus on one common overriding goal 
from day one how to get better products in half the time 
you dont do that by simply stepping on the gas leach 
concludes you rethink the business then you integrate all the 
elements you get everyone speaking the same language and sharing 
the same information 
technology might be a part of the rethinking but only as a tool

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
finished this day and i hope its good john 
steinbeck wrote in his journal in 1938 
the book he had just completed was the grapes of wrath a 
novel that would awaken the social conscience of americans in a way 
that uncle toms cabin the jungle and few other works of 
fiction have 
viking press which published the grapes of wrath on april 
14 1939 is marking the 50th anniversary of the book with a 
commemorative edition containing an introduction by studs terkel 
it is also publishing working days journals steinbeck kept 
during the research and writing of what critics consider his 
greatest work 
when he sat down to write his saga of the joads a dust bowl 
family migrating to california for a new life steinbeck 36 had 
already attained celebrity with tortilla flat of mice and 
men which had been made into a longrunning broadway play and 
four other novels 
he wrote what he called his big book in a fivemonth 
marathon scribbling a prodigious 2000 words a day steinbeck 
scholar robert demott who edited the journals for publication 
notes that the manuscripts strikingly show little revision 
but the author had already laid much groundwork having studied 
the migrant farmers from oklahoma texas kansas and arkansas 
derisively dubbed okies for a series of articles that 
appeared in the san francisco news he had bought an old bakery 
truck and equipped it with blankets food and camping equipment and 
spent time in a migrant resettling camp contrary to popular myth 
he never made the trek from oklahoma to california as did his 
fictional joads 
steinbeck had also written a 70000word precursor to the 
grapes of wrath that he destroyed saying the novel was too 
vicious and smartalec too much of a political tract but it 
rid him of some of the venom he felt against the associated farmers 
inc and others he felt responsible for the workers plight and 
allowed him to write what he thought was a more rounded novel 
indeed the question most frequently debated about the grapes 
of wrath which won a pulitzer prize is whether it is art or 
firebrand propaganda

sure cried the tenant farmers but its our land we were 
born on it and got killed on it and we died on it even if its 
no good its still ours thats what makes it ours that makes 
ownership not a paper with numbers on it 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
immediately after its release newspaper editorials legislators 
and farmers decried the novel as a distorted portrait of migrant 
life the book was burned in several cities including salinas 
calif steinbecks hometown and was banned in many libraries and 
schools 
eleanor roosevelt defended the book in her weekly column and in 
1940 a congressional committee held hearings in oklahoma to find 
out whether the squalid conditions and brutal treatment of the 
workers recounted in the novel were accurate the committees 
findings vindicated the author 
upon steinbecks death in 1968 the new york times wrote the 
following about the book the timorous and savagely reactionary 
among us were fretfully afraid that steinbeck had gone too far in 
his novels portrayal of the desperately distressed in america 
bless their hearts they were dead right he was out to rouse not 
to soothe us into asking human beings to starve quietly and 
inconspiculously during those years of depression and despair 
terkel said he finds modernday critics who call the grapes of 
wrath propaganda pretty tiresome 
you can can say moby dick is propaganda the author and 
radio raconteur said in a telephone interview from his chicago 
office 
terkel who toured the midwest in 1987 when family farms were 
foreclosing one after another and who witnessed the drought of 
1988 played out on the six oclock news finds steinbecks words 
startlingly relevant today 
its as though we never experienced the depression and hadnt 
learned anything from it said terkel who planned to mark the 
anniversary by reading from the novel on his radio show 
interspersed with selections from dustbowl ballads by woody 
guthrie 
it should be noted that while critics hashed out the literary 
merits of the book the public snapped it up in droves it was the 
bestselling book of 1939 and one of the top 10 bestsellers in 
1940 it also produced a successful movie adaptation starring henry 
fonda that won director john ford an academy award 
the grapes of wrath remains one of vikings alltime 
bestsellers today and has sold some 14 million copies worldwide 
said viking spokesman paul slovak

in awarding steinbeck the nobel prize for literature in 1962 
the swedish academy cited the towering standard the author set 
in the grapes of wrath more than two decades earlier although 
he had produced more than a dozen novels and plays since that work 
demott founder of the steinbeck quarterly and an english 
professor at ohio university in athens ohio says in the preface 
of working days that steinbecks legacy was his willingness 
to risk everything to write the best he could with what what gifts 
he had and in doing so to reveal unblinking the enduring human 
spirit among the ruthless shapes of paradise

change comes slowly down the twolane 
highway that winds through forests dairy farms and cattle barns 
into greensburg 
its taken four decades for desegregation to reach the seat of 
st helena parish and even now a visitor looking for john halls 
house behind the masonic lodge is asked you talking about the 
white masonic hall or the black one 
this parish hasnt changed since 1907 education has been 
what kept it like it is said hall a construction worker who has 
spent 37 of his 70 years fighting to give black students 
including his 14 children a chance 
hall filed suit in 1952 after being told that the school 
district didnt have money to furnish a black school ironically 
segregation ended because the district couldnt afford to keep it 
going this semester is the first in st helena parish with all 
black and white students under the same roof 
under a plan approved in december by us district judge john 
parker in baton rouge classes were consolidated into three 
buildings including one that hall and other black residents built 
in the early 1950s 
im not trying to take credit for anything hall said i 
wanted my children to get an education and thats what they got 
st helena parish has one of louisianas poorest school 
districts about 95 percent of the parishs annual 65 million 
budget comes from the state until jan 6 its 2040 students 70 
percent of them black attended seven schools 
there is no question the st helena parish school board has 
been operated in violation of the us constitution parker said 
in december adding that consolidation means desegregation will 
be accomplished 
he said some of the schools are not fit for a dog house 
superintendent perry p spears said all seven were substandard 
spears who is black and went to school here plans to do away with 
a fifth school and is working to float a 75 million bond issue 
this fall to improve the remaining two 
i enjoyed my elementary and high school career in st helena 
but at the same time i knew that we were not being supported 
equally he said 
the point was driven home for spears when he became 
superintendent three years ago and saw that white schools had 
equipment like washing machines and dryers for the athletic 
programs the black schools did not 
back in the early 1950s black students often sat on soft drink 
cases boxes and pieces of logs to listen to a teacher who didnt 
have enough supplies or even a chair to sit down on hall said 
these schools were as bad as anything youve ever seen i dont 
know why theyd send children up here to get an education at a 
place like that id rather put them under a tree 
in 1952 he asked the board for a new black school officials 
told him there wasnt enough money but they made a deal build 
the school yourself and the parish will furnish it the black 
community pitched in their meager assets and their elbow grease to 
build a new school hall returned to complete the deal and was 
told there was no money for furnishings 
i told him right then that im going to take my children up 
there to go to school with the white folks he said he took 
him a good laugh he and his crew had a big funmaking deal about 
it i understand 
hall didnt laugh he his father and two other black residents 
who still want to remain anonymous went to ap tureaud an 
attorney for the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
they said youre going to have some mad white folks here 
hall said i said i was already mad despite the warning he 
said the black residents faced nothing more than talk all kinds 
of threats and talk 
although the supreme court outlawed segregated schools in 1954 
halls suit and scores of other desegregation cases floated in the 
courts for years 
in the 1960s st helena parish built a modern black high 
school a few blacks started going to white greensburg high school 
and a few whites attended classes in the black schools it was 
all token desegregation hall said 
segregation hurt both black and white students he said you 
cant hold back one race without holding the other back 
over the years running seven schools used up the parishs 
allotment of statesupported teacher salaries and resulted in 
duplication of basic classes as a result few advanced classes 
were offered and the students suffered 
we have not been able to offer a comprehensive curriculum 
spears said i feel that was the biggest disadvantage we had over 
the years 
under consolidation elementary school students eat lunch in a 
makeshift cafeteria set up in an old gymnasium and some attend 
class in trailers head start pupils still go to the cramped 
building that black residents built 
most opposition came from parents spears said they have 
caused a problem by letting their kids see how much they oppose 
consolidation i dont think our kids generally oppose 
consolidation 
in fact students give consolidation a mixed review 
its going on pretty well now said pamecia foskey a black 
senior its all coming together were thinking of it as one 
school 
itll probably be better next year but i wont be around to 
find out said kelly smith a white sophomore who is going to 
private school in mississippi next fall 
its gone better than everybody thought said deann fugler 
a white sophomore who also plans to go to private school its 
too crowded right now if the facility gets better i might come 
back its hard to tell 
about 150 students mostly white have enrolled in private 
schools or are illegally attending public schools in other 
parishes spears said 
he is enthusiastic about the future especially if the bond 
issue passes 
i think that the community is going to have more pride in its 
schools we wont have that competition between schools the 
competition is because we had allwhite and allblack schools 
a recent high school basketball game was an example of what 
spears hopes will become the rule it was obvious that these were 
kids that had never been brought together before the support was 
like we hadnt had before its now oneandone i feel good about 
it its going to be a family relationship 
hall who thought his lawsuit would be settled in four or five 
years isnt so sure it will be slow slow the chance for 
change will have to come with the new generation not with none of 
the ones who are here now

deep within the florida panhandles 
aromatic piney woods is a small place where some of the nations 
bestknown and wealthiest men come to spend time 
occasionally the locals say the swells arrive in fancy cars 
driven by uniformed chauffeurs recent visitors included the head 
of a famous fashion house a federal judge and a former congressman 
even top sports figures such as lamarr hoyt the cy young 
awardwinning pitcher sometimes show up 
while in residence these big shots may try their hand at 
italian lawn bowling or they can indulge themselves on the tennis 
courts play a game of racquetball or take a turn on a walking 
trail that winds through landscaped grounds past a lake 
afterwards they can catch a movie on cable tv or if they have 
the money visit the commissary for a cup of cappuccino and some 
haagendazs macadamia brittle one of several flavors 
there are drawbacks 
there is no swimming pool and since this exclusive little 
facility is a federal prison camp everyone must sleep in 
dormitories and work eight hours a day at a beginning pay rate of 
11 cents an hour 
welcome to club fed as the eglin federal prison camp is 
sometimes called it is one the 27 federal work camps where the 
us bureau of prisons houses its least dangerous felons 
sometimes derisively dubbed a country club prison eglin 
houses a population thats 66 percent white 12 percent black and 
22 percent hispanic highersecurity federal prisons house about 
equal numbers of blacks and whites 
twothirds of the eglin inmates have never been to prison before 
these are nonviolent people from a variety of backgrounds 
not all of them are big shots by any means said willie scott 
superintendent of the 28acre compound most of them are serving 
short sentences and since they arent dangerous and we are 
located on a military base we dont even need to have a fence 
around the place 
asked if he was running a prison for rich white inmates scott 
said definitely not he explained the whiteblack ratio by 
saying that blacks tend to live in more economically depressed 
areas where theres a greater likelihood of violent crime while 
whites have more opportunity for socalled whitecollar criminal 
acts 
even without a fence escapes are relatively rare among the 830 
whitecollar tax cheats embezzlers medicaidchiseling doctors 
shyster lawyers crooked politicians and lowlevel drug dealers who 
make up the camp population 
we have about a halfdozen walkaways each year scott said 
but anybody who walks knows he wont be coming back here hell 
be going to a highersecurity prison where the inmates are more 
violent and theres less freedom 
inmates say the camp is more hell than heaven 
this is no country club at a country club you get to go home 
when you want to said stephen gray a californian who is serving 
time for bank fraud 
the only thing this place is good for is to cause divorces and 
put children on the street without a father 
gray called the prison a waste of taxpayers money if were 
not dangerous what are we doing here he said 
it costs the government almost 11000 a year to keep each of 
the nearly 12000 inmates currently incarcerated in prison camps 
thats 132 million annually said greg bogdan a spokesman for the 
us bureau of prisons 
eleven thousand a year is a lot of money but its still 
relatively cheap when you think that it costs about 18000 a year 
to keep a man behind a fence said scott a 17year veteran of 
the federal penal system who came to eglin from the maximum 
security prison at marion ill 
he disagrees with critics who say the prison camps are little 
more than whitecollar gulags if the idea is to deter crime 
theres no deterrent like incarceration scott said 
some prisons have been called schools for crime but scott said 
eglin is the opposite contact with the educated professionals 
among the inmates can benefit other prisoners 
some recent bigname inmates include 81yearold aldo gucci 
head of the fashion empire he served a oneyear term for tax 
evasion 
us district judge walter nixon jr a convicted perjurer and 
former congressman richard kelly snared in the fbis abscam sting 
served time at eglin 
inmate greg bell remembers gucci as a man of immense presence 
i was working in food services when he was here recalled 
bell a melbourne fla contractor whos doing 37 months for a 
drug deal i used to really get a kick out of serving him 
breakfast id say and how would you like your eggs today mr 
gucci 
gucci worked in the prisons tailor shop doing alterations 
while some inmates deride the camps educational and industrial 
training programs bell said he learned a great deal from a stock 
option course taught by an inmate who used to be a commodities 
broker 
inmates at other prisons who qualify for eglin because of good 
behavior are on a waiting list 
were already doubled up here scott said theres no more 
room at this time the federal prison system is 154 percent 
overcrowded and will become even more so what with the new 
sentencing guidelines that mandate stiffer sentences and more time 
served 
faced with this expanding prison population the government has 
built five new labor camps within 18 months four of them on 
military bases its just much cheaper to use existing facilities 
than building new camps bogdan said 
john oury the associate superintendent at eglin added our 
mission here isnt to make things easy for criminals it is to 
provide support for the military base 
as a taxpayer id much rather see our uniformed personnel 
spending their time protecting the country than picking up trash 
let the prisoners pick up the trash and maintain the base it makes 
good sense and saves money

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says the 
european economic community shouldnt think it has forced the 
united states to turn tail on the issue of disruptive farm 
subsidies 
quite the contrary he says us negotiators are holding to a 
hard line that calls for the elimination of tradedistorting 
subsidies over the long haul 
the united states will continue to aggressively seek 
elimination of tradedistorting measures he said the 
longterm component of the negotiations will indeed be an arduous 
exercise but it i is long overdue 
some may have thought the eec won a victory of sorts when it 
blocked some of the wording initially offered in the us proposal 
seeking the eventual elimination s an effort thatof tradedistorting 
subsidies 
even after the united states changed the wording to seek a 
ratcheting down of the subsidies in future years the 12nation 
trading bloc remained unmovable 
finally in geneva talks the week of april 28 more than 100 
countries reached agreement on an agricultural framework to be used 
in further trade negotiations in the months ahead it calls for a 
substantial progressive reduction of disruptive farm subsidies 
no mentionon that the committment 
must be consistent with existing legislation 
the report added our assessment is that this will not require 
us to do anything differently from what we are now doing for 1990 
our 1985 farm legislation requires cuts in some support prices 
in other words the report said the shortterm agreement is a 
political commitment to prevent worsening of policies that distort 
agricultural trade while longterm reform is being negotiated 
here are further observations from the yeutter background report 
on the shortterm agreement reached in geneva and how the accord 
may affect us programs 
the operation of the sugar program including import quotas 
will not be restricted 
no commitment was made on the operation of the acreage 
reduction programs that cover major crops such as wheat and feed 
grains other countries were convinced that it would be unwise to 
bind our hands when us and global stockpiles are low 
spending under the export enhancement program eep and 
other export programs will not be frozen there was no specific 
commitment on the level of expenditure for any single program 
although export subsidization is included as part of a broad 
commitment not to exceed current levels of domestic and export 
support and protection 
under eep targeted countries can buy us commodities at 
subsidized prices the program is aimed at keeping us products 
competitive with other countries notably the eec which subsidize 
exports 
trade retaliation will not be prohibited under socalled 
section 301 procedures the united states said since the beginning 
of the uruguay round that we would not suspend our right to 
defend ourselves against unfair trade practices during the course 
of the negotiations 
there is no plan to initiate section 301 action against japan 
because of its restriction on imports of rice the united states 
said japanese rice is a subject for the uruguay round and as 
long as japan continues to be cooperative in the negotiations we 
will stick to that approach

ask george burns to say something funny and 
hell come back with two words charlie chaplin 
to lucille ball chaplin was pure genius and jack lemmon 
calls him the definitive artist of this century 
few characters in film history ever touched as many lives as 
chaplins tramp the little fellow as he called him was the 
epitome of the fighting underdog down but never out hopelessly 
romantic despite endless disappointment determined to retain his 
dignity in the face of despair and humiliation 
chaplin moved beyond the piethrowing and wild chases of 
slapstick to make audiences understand the tramps feelings about 
himself and the world around him he was as the film critic james 
agee once said the first man to give the silent language a 
soul 
april 16 marks the 100th anniversary of chaplins birth and his 
centennial is being celebrated with tributes throughout the world 
his admirers included kings and queens soldiers and prisoners 
children chased him in the street writers and poets sought his 
company from london to japan crowds would swarm around him 
generations of performers looked to chaplin as they sculpted 
their own brands of humor 
bill cosby realized the extent of chaplins influence after 
seeing his 1931 classic city lights in which the tramp 
befriends a millionaire and falls in love with a blind girl 
while watching the feature i was getting very angry at 
charlie chaplin because i was noticing he was doing a lot of funny 
things that id seen other comedians in other features do cosby 
said it was only later that all those things i saw him doing 
were things he created and that the other talents had copied him 
the famous assemblyline sequence from an i love lucy 
episode in which lucy and ethel try to keep up with the chocolates 
is derived from a similar scene in chaplins 1936 modern times 
in which an assemblyline worker goes crazy 
the silent chase scene in woody allens bananas is another 
chaplininspired bit the filmmaker once said in an interview that 
he admired the way chaplin used thin plots on which to hang funny 
scenes 
chaplin could take the simplest human predicament and expand it 
into a lifetime a scene in the old tv series the 
honeymooners finds ralph and ed locked up in ralphs freezing 
apartment on a rent strike theyre running out of food and must 
eat celery for dinner ed art carney pretends the celery is a 
fullcourse steak dinner and eats with great flourish chaplin did 
a similar bit when he devoured his boot in the gold rush 
chaplin who died in 1977 following a stroke was born in 
lambeth a ghetto in the south of london the son of music hall 
performers his early years were difficult his parents charles 
and hannah were separated by 1892 his father rarely made child 
support payments forcing charlie and his older brother sydney to 
spend time in a local orphanage charlie was close to his mother 
but she was mentally unstable and drifted in and out of nursing 
homes 
i dont think he ever lost that thing about poverty 
recalled jerry epstein a longtime friend whose book remembering 
charlie has recently been released that haunts you one day 
you wake up and its all gone thats a living nightmare he once 
said to me what would have happened to me if i never left 
england 
chaplin showed talent as a mime and acrobat and first appeared 
on stage when he was 4 singing at a nearby music hall for a wildly 
appreciative audience of soldiers who threw money at the young 
performer by 1899 he had become one of the eight lancashire lads 
a traveling group of dancers and comedians 
in 1908 he became a comic with the celebrated fred karno 
company impressing and at times alienating peers with his 
singleminded devotion to his craft chaplin would later punctuate 
a creative dispute by insisting this is my work 
on a tour of the united states late in 1912 he was spotted by a 
talent agent the following year he signed a oneyear contract for 
150 a week with mack sennetts keystone films known for slapstick 
movies that concluded with spectacular chases 
chaplins first motion picture making a living was 
released in 1914 to generally favorable reviews although his 
character bore no resemblance to the tramp chaplin wearing a top 
hat monacle and droopy mustache portrayed a slicker who tries to 
scoop a reporter 
in his third picture mabels strange predictament he 
unveiled the tramp drawing on english music hall costumes he 
contrasted oversized pants and extra long shoes with a shrunken 
jacket and battered bowler hat adding a tiny mustache and walking 
cane to give the impression of a man aspiring for status but not 
succeeding 
he said the cane was the key to the whole characterization 
epstein recalled the minute he found that cane he knew he had 
the character he could attack people with it he could act like 
the gentleman with it 
chaplin gave the tramp a shuffling splayfooted walk that 
he picked up by imitating an old man called rummy banks who 
used to hold horses for coachmen outside a neighborhood pub 
audiences instantly responded a chicago reporter interviewed 
chaplin and commented you cant keep your eyes off his feet 
those big shoes are buttoned with 50 million eyes 
charlie chaplin cartoons began appearing in newspapers songs 
came out those charlie chaplin feet charlie chaplin the 
funniest of them all and the moon shines bright on charlie 
chaplin 
by 1916 chaplin was with the mutual film corporation making a 
staggering annual salary of 670000 and critics were starting to 
regard his films as more than just entertainment an article in 
harpers weekly the art of charles chaplin praised the star 
in ways comedians never were it compared the vulgarity of his 
films to the works of aristophanes and shakespeare 
in 1919 chaplin mary pickford douglas fairbanks and dw 
griffith formed united artists as a way of independently producing 
and financing their own films 
initially it was great said william everson a professor of 
cinema studies at new york university none of these people were 
getting the full results of their labor on paper it seemed ideal 
but financially it wasnt feasible

chaplin began fleshing out his films mostly onereelers with 
social commentary relating the hardship faced by europeans coming 
to america in the immigrant and stressing the bonds shared by 
warring soldiers in shoulder arms 
his sentimental side emerged even more strongly in his feature 
films starting in 1921 with the kid which depicted the 
tramps friendship with an abandoned boy jackie coogan 
the film chaplins first fulllength feature grossed 2 
million made an instant star out of young coogan and gave full 
display to chaplins dramatic range his next feature the gold 
rush came out in 1925 and is regarded by chaplin and many 
others as his finest work 
inspired by stories of the 1898 gold rush the movie starred 
chaplin as the lone prospector and contained one of the most 
famous sequences in film history the dance of the rolls 
chaplin invites an attractive singer and her friends to dinner 
on new years eve and enthusiastically prepares the meal but his 
company never shows up and chaplin falls asleep he dreams about 
entertaining the guests by sticking forks in two dinner rolls and 
acting out a puppetlike dance on the table 
in another immortal segment hes stranded without food in a 
freezing cabin and boils his own boot consuming the dinner with 
considerable relish even twirling the laces like spaghetti 
chaplin often referred to an early love affair that would 
forever leave him with the desire to reach out for beauty a 
yearning he employed to heartbreaking effect in the gold rush 
and the circus in which the tramp falls in love with a circus 
girl 
in vain the tramp would pursue beautiful unreachable women 
never more movingly than in city lights in which he befriends 
a pretty blind flower girl and convinces her that he is a man of 
wealth and distinction 
as agee wrote the tramp is eventually brought down to painful 
reality when he raises the money necessary for the blind girl to 
regain her sight 
at the end of city lights she sees him for the first 
time she has imagined and anticipated him as princely to say the 
least and it had never seriously occurred to him that he is 
inadequate she recognizes who he must be by his shy confident 
shining joy as he comes silently toward her and he recognizes 
himself through the terrible changes in her face 
the camera just exchanges a few quiet closeups of the 
emotions which shift and intensify in each face it is enough to 
shrivel the heart to see and it is the greatest piece of acting 
and the highest moment in movies 
chaplins peers praised him in similar terms the great buster 
keaton repeatedly deferred to his rival as being in a class by 
himself writing that nobody ever made so many people laugh as 
did charlie with his little tramp 
although the onset of talking films in the late 20s ruined the 
careers of many stars notably john gilbert chaplin was reluctant 
to use sound complaining that dialogue to my way of thinking 
always slows action because action must wait upon words 
motion pictures need dialogue as much as beethoven symphonies 
need lyrics he once said 
city lights was chaplins last silent movie in 1936 he 
released modern times which had some crude sound effects and 
made a star out of paulette goddard the third of his four wives 
both movies were boxoffice hits as was 1940s the great 
dictator a stinging attack against hitler who bore an uncanny 
resemblance to the comic in 1941 his artistic dreams played 
second to his personal life he met and had a brief relationship 
with a young actress joan barry she later accused chaplin of 
fathering her child although blood tests backed up his claims that 
the baby wasnt his a california jury said he was causing 
considerable damage to his reputation and paving the way for 
rightwing branding of communism 
with mccarthyism in full and furious throttle chaplin an 
outspoken liberal and supporter of the wartime alliance with the 
soviet union came under harsh attack he had lived in california 
but had never become a us citizen considering himself a 
citizen of the world 
when he went to england in the early 50s to film limelight 
his entry permit was revoked the man who had embodied the american 
dream working his way from music hall performer to international 
celebrity lived his final years in vevey switzerland 
i never saw him depressed jerry epstein said he loved 
america he would say after all thats where i met oona 
oona oneill daughter of the playwright eugene oneill was 18 
when they married chaplin was 54 
she devoted her whole life to him epstein said she knew 
how to handle an artist oona is completely reserved 
selfeffacing never wanted the career never wanted the limelight 
she was in love with him her whole life 
she always said when i was young he looked after me now 
that hes an old man its my turn to look after him 
their eight children carved their own fame geraldine the 
oldest became an actress who soared to fame in david leans 1965 
epic dr zhivago josephine portrayed hemingways wife in a tv 
miniseries about the writer michael played one of the leads in 
king in new york when he was 9 all three children had walkons 
in limelight 
victoria runs a french circus called le cirque imaginaire

producer of the superman movies annette recently appeared in a 
stage production of sam shepards buried child in france 
christopher 25 the youngest appeared in notes from the 
underground in london 
chaplin also had two children from his second wife lita grey 
sydney won a tony playing opposite judy holliday in bells are 
ringing and costarred with barbra streisand in funny girl 
on broadway charlie jr died about 20 years ago 
after monsieur verdoux flopped in 1947 chaplin never again 
regained his commercial appeal limelight released in 1952 
contained a memorable musical sequence with chaplin and buster 
keaton but had only moderate success he made just two more 
movies both poorly received a king in new york and a 
countess from hong kong a 1967 comedy starring marlon brando and 
sophia loren 
chaplin spent the last 10 years of his life collecting honors 
composing new scores for his movies and working on a project the 
freak it was never completed 
he returned briefly to the united states in 1972 to receive an 
honorary oscar from the academy of motion picture arts amp 
sciences the cannes film festival had paid tribute to him the year 
before and the venice film festival gave him a special golden lion 
award he received knighthood from queen elizabeth ii in march 1975 
a fan of the underdog to the end chaplin expressed admiration 
for sylvester stallones rocky murmuring excellent 
excellent as he watched the movie 
he just took life as it came epstein said he never spoke 
about death he never spoke about old age he felt he was still 
young he never lost his sense of curiosity

corsiersurvevey switzerland ap the plain wooden cross 
that marked the burial site before the sensational theft of the 
body was replaced long ago 
now theres a white marble tombstone with the simple 
inscription charles chaplin 18891977 dropping the sir 
to which the worldfamous comedian was entitled after being 
knighted by queen elizabeth ii in 1975 
under a bright spring sun the forgetmenots and the white and 
rose hyacinths seemed freshly planted other graves in the swiss 
cemetery were equally well kept bearing names more familiar in the 
village where the reclusive actor never really struck roots 
i am sure their gardner will prepare some special floral 
decoration for the anniversary said etienne buenzod a communal 
employee who takes care of the cemetery of corsier a winegrowing 
village overlooking lake geneva where chaplin spent the last 25 
years of his life 
i saw some of his films but i saw him in person only once 
during these 25 years he was a very discreet man 
so seems his widow lady oona who still resides in the 
chaplins manoir de ban an 18thcentury manor just above corsier 
but who is rarely seen in the village 
corsier was preparing for weeks of festivities marking the 100th 
anniversary of chaplins birth he was the villages most famous 
resident and posthumously put its name on front pages worldwide 
when two wouldbe extortionists snatched his body 
buenzod discovered the theft on march 2 1978 more than two 
months after chaplin died on christmas day following a stroke the 
300pound oakandsilver coffin with the body inside was recovered 
10 weeks later buried in a cornfield about 10 miles from here 
news of the bizarre theft spread throughout the world the 
soviet news agency tass denounced it as typical for the 
atmopshere of crime in the inhuman western world 
but a swiss court took a more lenient view of the two 
perpetrators political refugees from poland and bulgaria 
i wanted to get money without harming anyone testified 
roman wardas the thefts bungling polish mastermind who was 
arrested when he ran out of coins at a public phone during ransom 
negotiations with the chaplins family lawyer 
the two also had to dig up the coffin for a second time because 
they had forgotten to take photographs to prove they were holding 
it lady oona according to the lawyer categorically rejected 
ransom demands lowered gradually from 600000 to 100000 saying 
her husband was in heaven and in my heart 
wardas was sentenced to 4 years in prison but freed after 
three years because of good conduct

karen kocharian a darkhaired doeeyed boy who 
suffered a crushed hand when last decembers earthquake in armenia 
collapsed his school has spent the last two months in 
philadelphia undergoing reconstructive surgery as he awaits two 
more operations to give him operable fingers he absorbs american 
culture this is the third report in an intermittent series 
tracking karens progress the story is by associated press 
reporter bruce rule with laserphotos by photographer amy sancetta 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when karen kocharian arrived here two months 
ago for treatment of injuries suffered in decembers armenian 
earthquake he was a 9yearod in a gray suit who talked about 
soccer and chess now its blue jeans and sneakers video games and 
pee wee herman 
karen now 10 is one of 37 armenian children to be treated at 
10 american hospitals under a program sponsored by project hope 
four of the children including karen are being treated at 
childrens hospital of philadelphia 
karen lost his right eye and the fingers on his right hand when 
his grade school collapsed in the dec 7 quake which left 
thousands of his countrymen dead injured or homeless soviet 
doctors gave him a glass eye before he left for the united states 
although overwhelmed with curiosity when he first arrived he 
waited to ask questions until he was alone with annadid ohanian 
whose family is host to karen and karens father sarkis and he 
kept his bandaged maimed hand in his suit pocket 
finally fascination with that most american of love objects 
the automobile pulled karen out of his shell 
within days of arriving in february he had seen camaros 
porsches and cadillacs with a toy camera from the ohanians he 
shot two rolls of film photographing the ohanian family cars a 
corvette two fieros and a trans am from every angle 
when we go back he told his father firmly i dont want 
to ride in our afto mekana a nondescript russianmade car 
i will build my own car he said planning to work as an 
auto mechanic like his father 
his father sarkis also has changed 
at first quiet and reserved he is quicker to chat with 
americanarmenians who visit how do you do he says in english 
to other visitors 
sarkis a stocky 34yearold with specks of gray in his hair 
also has become more vocal about what he sees as shortcomings in 
the soviet system 
when the ohanians first brought sarkis to their small variety 
store in west philadelphia he was amazed at the number of 
available items 
he asked why cant we have this back home george ohanian 
said 
recently a tass reporter called from new york city 
sarkis answered questions with questions smiling and winking at 
the other armenians present 
who is going to pay for all this he was asked 
dont you know he replied adding not your country 
project hope will and my countrymen will 
later sarkis said he was angry because the soviets have placed 
severe restrictions on what he and karen can bring back to armenia 
project hope has been giving the childrens guardians 10 a day 
toward living expenses sarkis has spent most of the money on 
karen he has bought himself only a white jogging suit 
now he said he is afraid he will not be able to bring back any 
of the clothes or toys karen has received as presents since 
arriving here 
ohanian said the soviets have an official list of what may be 
brought into the country it specifies only one of each item one 
pair of pants one shirt one toy and so on 
sarkis has not yet told karen who continues to play with the 
matchbox cars and other toys hes received from wellwishers in 
places from northborough mass to tustin calif 
last month two of karens toes were transplanted to his right 
hand so he would have fingers the operation was not wholly 
successful and circulation problems developed so doctors sewed 
karens new fingers into a skin flap on his stomach to help with 
the healing 
the doctors say karen needs two more operations to build the 
toes into complete fingers 
naturally righthanded the boy takes therapy to strengthen his 
lefthanded abilities he plays magnetized pickup sticks bounces 
basketballs and writes letters for his physical therapist dore 
diberardino 
most days are spent at the ohanians store karen answers the 
telephone with a bright greeting armenian touch 
for lunch everyday he orders his favorite american sandwich 
corned beef on rye hold the cheese when he talks english words 
pop into his conversation 
at the ohanians suburban west chester home karen steers a 
riding mower around the backyard with his left hand wrenching the 
wheel back and forth 
recently he and his father were watching an armenianlanguage 
video baghdassar akhbar karen laughed occasionally at the 
family comedy but his eyes brightened when sarkis switched to 
pee wee hermans big adventure on cable television 
karen laughed at every visual gag hugging his stomach when pee 
wees motorcycle hit a billboard the boy screamed in english 
oh my god and fell back laughing 
for himself sarkis admits to enjoying sylvester stallones 
rambo and rocky movies 
they are much different now said ohanian an armenian 
immigrant who is housing the kocharians because he wanted to help 
the children who are armenians future 
they have come here to get medical treatment he said 
tousling karens hair but were sending them back american 
rebels

some of the most interesting films of 1988 stemmed from novels 
dangerous liaisons the accidental tourist little 
dorrit the last temptation of christ the unbearable 
lightness of being pelle the conqueror 
while original screenplays remain the most prevalent source of 
films it is heartening to see the comeback of novels 
why so because from the birth of a nation to gone with 
the wind to terms of endearment novels have lent film 
entertainment a substance that is often lacking on a diet of 
scripts originated by screenwriters and homogenized by countless 
rewrites 
winter people is the latest evidence adapted by carol 
sobieski from john ehles novel the film has faults and excesses 
but it also offers a certain majesty and an accurate sense of time 
and place the blue ridge mountains in the depression 1930s 
wayland jackson kurt russell is a watchmaker who is driving 
his motherless daughter amelia burnette to philadelphia to start 
a new life when their pickup truck is wrecked in a mountain 
stream they take refuge with a mysterious woman kelly mcgillis 
who lives in a remote cabin with her fatherless baby boy 
the mystery unravels mcgillis has been ostracized by her 
family the wrights who are the leading citizens of a nearby 
village the father of her child is the unruly son jeffrey meek 
of the lawless campbell clan longtime enemies of the wrights 
russell wins the young mothers confidence and love and the 
respect of her family after proving his manhood on a bear hunt 
when the father of mcgillis son dies mysteriously the 
longsmoldering feud between the wrights and the campbells erupts 
in violence 
director ted kotcheff manages to keep the complicated plot 
running smoothly though at times the mountain dialect is hard to 
comprehend kelly mcgillis gives understated strength to her role 
and kurt russell has his strongest characterization to date though 
the transition from milquetoast to macho man is less than smooth 
lloyd nolan and mitchell ryan are powerful as patriarchs of the 
two families as the violent campbell jeffrey meek is terrifying 
the mountain scenery have been stunningly photographed by francois 
protat 
winter people was produced by robert h solo for columbia 
pictures scariness and sexual tension give it a pg13 rating 
running time 115 minutes

laws 
jefferies also supplied information for the governments stock 
manipulation case against gaf corp which ended in a second

time inc intends to become a major player in 
basic cable television programming says the media giants 
chairman who also took a few jabs at broadcasters who have tried 
to belittle the medium 
in a speech tuesday to cable executives and advertisers 
chairman j richard munro also defended times planned 15 billion 
merger with warner communications inc against criticism from those 
he called the lords of leverage and domestic rivals that he 
said were suffering merger envy 
the deal is subject to review by federal regulators and approval 
by the shareholders of both companies the justice department 
recently announced it will not oppose the merger 
time is only indirectly involved in basic cable programming 
those channels cable subscribers automatically receive through 
investments in companies such as turner broadcasting system inc 
which operates the cable news network and other basic cable 
services 
times home box office inc subsidiary owns two premium cable tv 
services hbo and cinemax for which cable subscribers pay an 
additional fee over their monthly charge there have been published 
reports that hbo is considering launching a comedy cable network 
while munro did not specifically address those reports in his 
talk to the cabletelevsion advertising bureaus annual conference 
he said our goal in basic cable is to develop a highquality 
welldefined differentiated service with the audience appeal of 
hbo and the channel identification of cnn 
he noted that some critics have described the basic cable 
audience as underpaid overaged out of touch 
but munro said cable has changed television from a passive 
medium with three main viewing choices into a responsive medium 
able to appeal to a far broader range of tastes and interests 
than before 
he said some broadcasting executives have responded by refusing 
to acknowledge the changes that have occurred in viewing habits 
time recognizes the networks dilemma munro said because it 
faced the same situation in magazines in the late 1970s when 
regional and specialized magazines began attracting bigger 
increases in ad spending than times mass market magazines were 
seeing 
munro said time faced up to market realities and built itself 
into the nations largest regional publisher 
i dont want to sound like im making a blanket attack on 
broadcast im not he said he said there are a lot of smart 
people at the networks who know the value and potential of cable 
and are trying to get in on it 
the national broadcasting co for instance launches a business 
network on basic cable next week 
regarding the merger plan with warner munro repeated the 
dealmakers assertions that the pact would guarantee an american 
company will be among the few global giants expected to dominate 
the communications business by the mid1990s 
he said some of times and warners domestic competitors dont 
like the deal munro called it a chronic case of merger envy 
my advice to them is to save their energy to invest in finding 
the kind of match that will help keep them competitive in global 
markets he said 
munro also chided the lords of leverage who he said hate 
the deal because it builds a new company instead of breaking up two 
existing ones 
to put it politely i think their expressed concern that 
shareholders are being shortchanged by this deal resembles nothing 
so much as the cat worrying about the good health of the canary 
he said

devaluations of the mexican peso as has been called for in

endorsement of the economic strategy of mexico aspe said the

wendys international inc is putting its 
money where its mouth is by offering customers a refund if they 
dont think theyve tasted the best hamburger in the business 
the promise is part of a sixweek advertising campaign in which 
wendys one of the nations largest fastfood chains proclaims 
itself the winner in a taste contest with industry leader 
mcdonalds corp the ad campaign started monday and ends in midmay 
charles w rath executive vice president of marketing said the 
suburban dublinbased company favors the tastetest over a campaign 
emphasizing discounts 
the problem i have with discounts is that if you lower the 
price then it must have only been worth that much in the first 
place rath said in an interview tuesday weve got a product 
that we have a lot of confidence in its worth and its value to the 
consumer nobodys done this before 
the moneyback guarantee is in addition to the companys policy 
of refunding money to dissatisfied customers under the special 
offer the company will refund the price of the hamburger to 
customers who do not agree that the one they just ate was the best 
in the burger business 
rath said the company did not estimate how much the special 
refunds would cost the company 
we dont think were going to lose any more than we would on a 
legitimate complaint of a product that doesnt meet our 
standards he said 
industry analyst malcolm knapp of the newyork based marketing 
research company malcolm knapp inc called the promotion a great 
proposition he said wendys came out no 1 in a taste test this 
year in restaurant and institutions magazine 
knapp said the strategy will cost the company less money than 
such promotions as couponing or discounts 
couponing always gives away products for sure and if you do 
discounting youre giving away money he said 
knapp also said the campaign will bring more people into wendys 
restaurants wendys is virtually tied for third with hardees food 
systems inc in size among national fastfood chains burger king 
a division of pillsbury co is second 
wendys spokesman denny lynch said the refund strategy was 
tested in eight markets last year it was never a problem he 
said 
he said customers trying to abuse the offer likely will be 
discovered because patrons tend to return to the same restaurant 
he also said only a few people would try to get refunds by going to 
several restaurants 
is it worth it to do that for 139 i dont think so lynch 
said 
the advertising campaign includes a claim of taste superiority 
over mcdonalds 
wendys contends customers surveyed at random in 1987 and 1988 
preferred wendys hamburgers by a 21 ratio over those offered by 
mcdonalds rath said the company hired cj research of chicago to 
conduct the surveys about 1500 consumers were interviewed 
quarterly 
mcdonalds spokesman john onoda was not available for comment 
tuesday and did not return a call seeking comment 
wendys with about 3750 restaurants nationwide has annual 
sales of nearly 3 billion it earned 285 million last year 
continuing to rebound from 1986 when it lost 49 million the 
company made 45 million in 1987

the status of peter v ueberroths deal to buy 
strikebound eastern airlines from texas air corp remained in doubt 
when a tuesday midnight deadline passed without a final agreement 
ueberroth met with texas air chairman frank lorenzo at us 
bankruptcy court tuesday evening at 915 pm the meeting broke 
up and the two hastily walked out of the courthouse ueberroth said 
he did not know what would happen next 
lawyers for easterns unions remained until 1130 pm when 
judge burton r lifland told them to return to his chambers for a 
conference at 830 am wednesday ueberroths agreement to buy 
eastern from lorenzo expired at 1201 am under an agreement 
between the two sides 
asked about the midnight deadline lifland said its not my 
deadline there was an earlier deadline for certain things that i 
said and it was met he declined further comment 
the machinist union members pilots and flight attendants 
reached fiveyear contracts with ueberroth on monday but the the 
agreements are contingent on a trustee operating the airline until 
it comes out of bankruptcy the negotiators said 
eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on march 9 five days 
after the strike by machinist union members began the pilots and 
flight attendants honored the machinist picket lines crippling the 
airline jack bavis head of the eastern pilots said the unions 
would not go back to work with lorenzo in interim control 
theyre not going to do it for the guy they hate the most 
he said theyll do it for peter if hes there were there 
several lawyers involved said they expected that if a trustee is 
named it would be former defense secretary frank carlucci who was 
present for the meeting on monday carlucci declined to identify 
his role then and was not present tuesday 
lorenzo according to several sources refused to go along with 
appointing a trustee throwing the whole deal into doubt 
they went ballistic a source said tuesday describing 
lorenzos lawyers reaction 
by the end of the night no one was knew what would happen next 
i dont think any one person has the whole picture said 
james l linsey a lawyer for the pilots 
the day began with the parties meeting at a manahattan hotel and 
as the day wore on the lawyers and principals return to court the 
site of mondays talks 
ueberroth and his partner j thomas talbot arrived in late 
afternoon lorenzo in the early evening 
dozen of lawyers filled the marble hallways of the 
turnofthecentury courthouse as a series of meeting again 
unfolded tension built and at several times shouting could be 
overheard in the halls 
the climactic meeting ended at 915 pm ueberroth talbot 
lorenzo and eastern president phil bakes were together in a room 
across from liflands chambers when they emerged they put on 
their coats to leave but lifland summoned them 
lorenzo entered the judges chambers but ueberroth did not and 
when an aide of the judge asked ueberroth to join the former 
baseball commissioner said im not going in and waved his hand 
through the air in resignation 
lorenzo and his lawyers then walked out ueberroth held a 
private discussion with talbot and their lawyers and then 
ueberrroths side walked out 
im not optimistic ueberroth said in an elevator as he left 
the participants described the meetings as a fourway game 
between ueberroth lorzeno the unions and easterns creditors for 
the deal to work all four sides had to be in agreement 
unless you have all of these constituencies you dont have a 
plan said david boies an eastern lawyer 
under their fiveyear deals with ueberroth the three eastern 
unions get 30 percent ownership of the airline in exchange for 
about 210 million in concessions 
but the creditors committee is concerned with the deal joel 
zweibel an lawyer for the committee representing the unsecured 
creditors said the group wanted its financial advisers to review 
it 
we have some very serious reservations no one has made an 
effort to make a showing that eastern will be viable after this 
transaction is consummated zweibel said 
one condition of the proposed buyout that has raised concern is 
the transfer of 79 million in eastern assets to texas air 
without equivalent value to eastern from texas air the 
committee said in a resoltuion passed tuesday and given to the 
parties 
the committee also said it was concerned whether there was an 
economically viable business plan for the reorganized eastern and 
over the financial structure of the buyout in which texas air 
would receive 200 million for its eastern stock and eastern would 
incur 100 million in new debt 
zweibel said the creditors had not received a response from 
lifland to their statement 
when asked whether the creditors were open to renegotiating the 
tentative agreement between ueberroth and texas air he said 
anything can be renegotiated 
meanwhile a federal judge in miami said late tuesday he would 
make public his opinion wednesday at 855 am est whether 
easterns pilots are striking illegally 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals last month asked us 
district judge edward b davis to issue an opinion on whether 
easterns pilots walked off the job in support of striking 
machinists or whether the pilots were actually striking to further 
their own contract aims 
if davis finds the pilots in violation of the railway labor act 
the appeals court could order the pilots back to work such a 
ruling could have a major influence on whether texas air agrees to 
sell eastern 
also martin shugrue a former president of texas airs 
continental airlines has been hired as a consultant by ueberroth 
said a participant in the discussions the source said shugrue may 
play a major role in running eastern should ueberroth succeed with 
his bid 
under ueberroths agreement with the unions the machinists 
union would give up about 150 million in wage and benefit cuts a 
union source said tuesday the figures are smaller for other unions 
because after lorenzo bought eastern three years ago the pilots 
and flight attendants accepted pay cuts but the machinists did not

of the worlds largest drug and healthcareproducts companies 
according to a published report

the philadelphia inquirer reported in wednesday editions quoting 
unidentified sources familiar with the negotiations 
smithkline spokesman bob holland would not comment on the report 
early wednesday morning 
directors of smithkline agreed to the merger tuesday night 
after beechams directors had approved it earlier in the day the 
newspaper said 
the merger is subject to approval by shareholders and government 
regulators 
beecham and smithkline have been discussing a merger for months 
but did not disclose the talks publicly until april 2 in a joint 
statement then the companies said that if they agreed on a merger 
the new company would be governed by directors drawn equally from 
the boards of smithkline and beecham and would be run by managers 
from both firms 
the agreement stipulates that philadelphiabased smithkline 
would oversee three of the new companys five operating businesses 
pharmaceuticals clinical laboratories and animalhealth care said 
a source quoted by the inquirer on condition of anonymity

operation it would be run by john f chappell president of 
smithklines drug division smith kline amp french laboratories 
beecham would run the new companys two other operations 
overthecounter medications and personalcare products

p bauman an american who is beechams executive chairman 
smithklines chairman and chief executive officer henry wendt

rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the 
house ways and means committee has introduced a bill to simplify 
the corporate minimum tax 
committee aides said no estimate of how the bill would affect 
tax collections has been produced nor is it clear which 
industries if any would be hurt by the change 
in a speech to the house rostenkowski said tuesday he is open 
to suggestons for changes in the bill however he added i will 
oppose any attempt to extend the arbitrary bookincome preference 
beyond its scheduled expiration at the end of this year 
the corporate minimum tax is designed to ensure that any firm 
with a profit pays some tax no matter how many deductions are 
claimed a company calculates is liability under the regular 
corporate tax figures the minimum tax and pays the larger figure 
the 1986 tax overhaul amended the minimum levy to base the tax 
in 1987 through 1989 on the concept of book income a term normally 
used in reporting profits to stockholders but not to the irs for 
years starting in 1990 the law drops the bookincome concept and 
substitutes one known as adjusted current earnings 
rostenkowskis bill would eliminate adusted current earnings as 
a separate tax preference instead individual items of earnings 
would be treated as separate preferences eliminating one 
complicated set of calculations

six people have been indicted on 40 counts of 
racketeering conspiracy bank fraud and other charges in 
connection with the failure of an orange county savings and loan 
institution 
the indictment announced tuesday by us attorney robert 
bonner charged that the chief defendant janet faye mckinzie 39 
engineered a scheme that diverted more than 16 million from north 
american savings and loan of santa ana 
the alleged fraud cost taxpayers 120 million which bonner said 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp spent to cover insured 
deposits 
the government alleged that ms mckinzie along with her boss 
the late duayne d christensen devised the massive fraud which 
involved creating phony escrow accounts as well as false billings 
for construction expenses 
others charged in the indictment were members of construction 
firms who cooperated in the scheme as well as officers of related 
corporations and a man from arkansas who allegedly participated in 
the phony escrow scheme 
assistant us attorney nancy wieben stock who is prosecuting 
the case said christensen was a former dentist who had no prior 
experience in finance when he launched north america savings and 
loan in 1983 
the thrift was in trouble almost from the outset she said it 
became the subject of a federal investigation in early 1987 
on jan 16 1987 the day that federal regulators were due to 
arrive and examine the sampls books christensen 57 died in a 
traffic accident his jaguar plowed into a stone wall on a freeway 
near newport beach ms stock said 
bonner noted that a 10 million life insurance policy had been 
taken out on christensen with mckinzie named as the beneficiary 
ms stock said that a lengthy investigation by the insurer found 
no evidence of suicide and the 10 million was paid into an 
account established to cover some federal losses if ms mckinzie is 
convicted

a 750 million settlement in the washington 
public power supply system default case was the best deal that 
could be struck attorneys for a group of bondholders said 
that appraisal was made tuesday to us district judge william 
d browning at a hearing on how to distribute money from 
settlements reached late last year in the 225 billion wppss 
litigation 
representatives of a separate classaction suit for some 
bondholders argued that no settlement should be approved until 
browning decides individual bondholders and attorneys shares in 
the settlement 
they also said the state of washington should bear more 
responsibility for its role in the biggest municipal bond default 
in the united states 
after listening to about two dozen attorneys and other parties 
in the case browning said he would try to issue a written decision 
promptly 
defendants in the case which combined dozens of suits filed 
since february 1983 included wppss all 88 utilities that 
contracted with the consortium to build two reactors engineering 
firms wall street bond underwriters utility and wppss directors 
and blyth eastman an advisory firm 
in 1983 wppss defaulted on bonds it sold to finance 
construction of a nuclear power plant at the hanford nuclear 
reservation and another at satsop west of olympia 
the default was triggered by a washington state supreme court 
ruling that the participating utilities lacked the legal power to 
sign contracts with wppss guaranteeing payment even if no 
electricity was generated 
that ruling left bondholders no option but a fraud suit paul 
bernstein one of the attorneys for bondholders told browning 
melvyn weiss another plaintiffs attorney said any fraud case 
is difficult enough to prove to a jury let alone one with the 
dozens of contending parties 
weiss said he and other attorneys for bondholders felt the most 
they could achieve if they won the case was a 14 billion 
settlement 
the 750 million settlement was much more likely and it could 
well be much less he added 
bernstein estimated a settlement now rather than after years of 
litigation would add about 250 million to the value received 
al malanca attorney for the washington public utility group 
one of the defendants said he believed defendants stood an 
excellent chance of winning at trial 
he said that before the series of settlements were struck there 
was absolutely no movement toward agreement and these were the 
maximum dollars that could have been gotten out of anyone 
camden hall an attorney for seattle which at 50 million would 
pay the largest amount of any defendant also said he felt there 
had been an excellent chance of winning possibly through summary 
judgment 
hall said city officials wanted to settle to avoid millions of 
dollars in future legal expenses and escape the shadow cast by the 
wppss default over future bond issues 
seattle could afford to settle because the city had insurance 
unlike many defendants especially tiny public utility districts 
which had no money to pay for an adverse ruling 
bondholder arthur hoffer has led a classaction suit against the 
state on behalf of bondholders who believed the state would get off 
too cheaply the state agreed to add 10 million to the settlement 
in return for an end to liability 
richard lehman an adviser to the wppss bond investors 
association argued that nearly all of the 600 bondholders who 
responded to a questionnaire he sent were opposed to settlements 
with the state bonneville power administration and wppss and were 
willing to pursue court action to get a better deal 
browning told lehmann many bondholders referred to the 
questionnaire in their letters some apparently believing browning 
could do something to change the settlement so they would get the 
full face value 
it is not fair to leave that impression and let them think 
that the court system has somehow let them down the judge said 
bpa wasnt named in the original suit but agreed to pay 35 
million to get chemical bank the bondholders trustee and 
bondholders to abandon efforts to petition congress to allow a suit 
against the federal powermarketing agency 
wppss paid no money in its settlement in exchange for 
cooperation from its employees at the trial plaintiffs attorneys 
said there wasnt enough money left in wppss to pursue 
of five reactors being built by wppss in the late 1970s only 
one was completed

sun microsystems inc the upstart company 
that helped launch the desktop computer industry trend toward 
highpowered workstations was unveiling an entire overhaul of its 
product line today 
some of the new machines priced from 5995 to 73900 boast 
sophisticated new graphics and digital sound technologies higher 
speeds and a circuit board that allows fullmotion video on a 
computer screen 
scott mcnealy suns president said in a prepared statement the 
revamped line is another step toward bringing more powerful desktop 
computers into everyday business and personal use 
tomorrow people will be talking to gesturing at and even 
arguing with these machines he predicted saying his new 
products reflect easeofuse features found before now only in 
personal computers 
workstations outperform personal computers by offering greater 
speed more memory and better monitors for enhanced graphics 
capabilities 
the star of suns new product line is the sparcstation 1 the 
most powerful fullfunction computer for under 9000 mcnealy 
claimed the price does not include disk drives 
the machines speed of 125 million instructions per second 
mips is about four times the speed of similarly priced highend 
macintosh from apple computer and more than twice as fast as the 
most powerful ibmcompatible personal computers previously the 
suns fastest risc machine had a speed of 7 mips for 22000 
the new machine and the revamped older models are designed to 
capture markets other than the traditional technical ones that for 
years have relied on machines from sun and rival apollo computer 
the companies control about 50 percent of the workstation market 
this machine is the beginning of sun getting into the volume 
market said richard shaffer editor of techologic computer 
letter 
anil gadre suns director of marketing for graphics predicted 
the new products will help the company for the first time sell more 
than 100000 workstations in a single year 
but kathleen hurley an analyst at the research firm of 
dataquest inc said the power and prices of some of the new 
products are comparable to others available on the commercial 
market 
sun is using the sparc technology its version of socalled risc 
reduced instruction set computing in an effort to capture a 
significant share of the burgeoning 4 billion workstation market 
by the mid 1990s the market for the machines is expected to be 
about 20 billion annually 
sun also plans to unveil during a twoday conference at the san 
francisco civil auditorium a library of 500 software packages than 
can be run on the new systems 
other new products to be announced today include a revamp of the 
original sun3 workstation line with the addition of motorolas 
fast 68030 microprocessor chip threemips machines that will start 
at 5995 a 16mips workstation based on risc chips starting at 
29900 and an equally fast sparc system starting at 40900 that 
is designed to operate as a server to interact with many 
computers on a network

chicagos wealthy pritzker family apparently is 
abandoning a plan to buy ramada inc and choosing instead to enjoy 
the profits flowing from the arizonabased hoteliers restructuring 
efforts 
hcc corp a chicago company headed by jay a pritzker has 
reduced its stake in ramada to 48 percent from the 72 percent it 
held when it offered last september to buy the company for 10 a 
share or about 368 million 
ramada rejected the proposal and embarked on a corporate 
restructuring that includes the sale of its hotel and restaurant 
businesses and will leave the company with three casinos in nevada 
and one in atlantic city nj 
pritzker would not comment tuesday on the reasons for the stock 
sale which was revealed in an april 5 filing with the securities 
and exchange commission 
john uphoff a stock analyst who follows ramada for raymond 
james amp associates in st petersburg fla speculated that the 
pritzkers simply saw the restructuring as a better deal 
i think that when it became clear that the restructuring 
would be completed at a price to shareholders 20 percent higher 
than the pritzkers had offered for the company the pritzkers 
decided they would be better served by taking their profits and 
letting management restructure the company uphoff said 
he said hcc probably began buying ramada stock at 4 to 6 a 
share the stocks price has risen from about 9 a share to nearly 
12 since the company announced its restructuring plan 
ramada closed tuesday at 1175 a share unchanged from mondays 
close 
hcc said in its sec filing that it had sold 959100 shares of 
ramada stock from march 16 through april 5 at an average price of 
1129 a share 
the sale leaves the pritzkers owners of the hyatt hotel chain 
and the industrial conglomerate marmon group inc with just under 
19 million shares of ramada according to the sec filing 
ramadas restructuring involves the sale of its 825 hotels and 
marie callenders pie shops inc which it acquired in 1986 
ramada has already agreed to sell the restaurant business to the 
wilshire restaurant group inc a group of private investors from 
new york and expects to announce the sale of its hotel group by 
midyear said spokesman joe cole from company headquarters in 
phoenix ariz 
we havent heard from the pritzkers since last october so i 
dont think we have any comment on what theyve just done cole 
said 
ramada will retain its hotelcasino operations the tropicana 
resortcasino in las vegas nev the newly remodeled tropworld 
resortcasino in atlantic city nj the ramada express 
hotelcasino in laughlin nev and eddies fabulous 50s casino in 
reno nev 
ramada reported a net loss of 51 million for 1988 on revenue 
of 4766 million the hotel and restaurant operations showed a net 
loss of 39 million for the year

ncnb corp has vowed to keep alive its 24 
billion bid for citizens amp southern corp even though the atlanta 
banking company has rejected the offer and steadfastly refused to 
negotiate 
ncnb will proceed with its merger proposal ncnb chairman 
hugh l mccoll jr said in a statement tuesday it is time for 
camps to stop posturing the camps board should promptly begin 
negotiations with us 
citizens board of directors last week rejected as inadequate 
the stockswap propsal by charlotte ncbased ncnb and said it 
had no plans to discuss the offer further 
citizens repeated its concerns about the bid in a lengthy 
statement issued tuesday it speculated the deal would face 
numerous legal and regulatory obstacles primarily because of 
ncnbs holdings in texas 
ncnb took over the management of the banks of the first 
republicbank corp of dallas last year as part of a government 
bailout that bank is now called ncnb texas national bank 
on monday georgia banking commissioner jack dunn said the 
regulatory issues involved in the deal could stretch the review 
process up to 18 months 
ncnb must now recognize the severe disruption and enormous 
cost to both institutions that could accompany a continuation of 
the ncnb bid citizens said 
industry analysts took note of the aggressive tone of both ncnb 
and citizens this week 
they citizens took the gloves off said thomas k brown 
an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york the 
only mistake they could make is to not be aggressive enough and 
look bad and regret it later 
but brown added i dont expect ncnb will just walk away from 
it theyll bring out their lawyers opinions to show where they 
believe camps is wrong 
ncnb is offering 1075 of its shares for each of citizens 
stock or around 40 a share the company has hinted it might be 
willing to raise its bid by around 5 a share if citizens agrees to 
negotiations 
the combination of the two would result in a bank with assets of 
around 75 billion placing it firmly in the top 10 among the 
nations bank holding companies

northwest airlines has asked a federal judge 
to prevent los angeles billionaire marvin davis from meddling with 
its unions while davis who is seeking to buy the nations 
fourthlargest airline filed a separate lawsuit seeking to 
invalidate the companys poison pill takeover defense 
davis who has offered to buy northwests parent nwa inc for 
262 billion or 90 a share said the airlines litigation is 
without merit and infringes on workers rights to to satisfy 
themselves as to the plans and intentions of a new owner 
davis an oilman with interests in real estate and 
entertainment also said he planned a shareholder proxy fight to 
win control of the airlines board at the companys may 15 
shareholders meeting 
no hearing date was immediately set on davis suit filed 
tuesday in delaware court of chancery nwa is based eagan minn 
and incorporated in delaware 
meanwhile us district judge harry maclauglin in st paul set 
a hearing for thursday to consider northwests request for an 
injunction against davis to prevent him from negotiating with the 
carriers pilots and other union workers 
northwests suit also filed tuesday contended davis and his 
partnership were illegally interfering with the companies 
relations with northwest labor unions 
the suit claimed davis is trying to block completion of a 
collective bargaining agreement being negotiated between northwest 
and its 5000member pilots union 
the suit said davis contacted the air line pilots association on 
april 4 the day after he announced his takeover bid in a letter to 
the board of directors of nwa 
davis also has talked to the leader of the international 
association of machinists district lodge 143 which recently agreed 
to recommend adoption of a proposed new contract for 10500 
clerical workers at northwest the lawsuit said 
in addition davis had talked with the leader of the teamsters 
union which represents northwests 6500 flight attendents 
the northwest suit says davis and nwa co the partnership he 
controls are seeking to have the unions negotiate with them to 
usurp northwests contractual and statutory role and thereby to 
interfere with and disrupt northwests prospective and existing 
contractual and labor relations with its principal unions 
last friday nwas board of directors rejected davis offer 
calling it inadequate the board also reaffirmed its intention to 
maintain the nations fourthlargest airline as an independent 
entity 
kevin whalen a spokesman for northwest said tuesday the 
airline would not comment on davis suit at least until we study 
the complaint 
davis meanwhile called the northwest action entirely without 
merit 
northwests board approved the poison pill march 27 saying it 
wanted to make the company less attractive to a hostile suitor 
intending to break up the company 
the plan would take effect when a person or group acquires 15 
percent of nwas common stock or announces a tender offer that 
would result in ownership of 15 percent or more of the voting power 
of nwa stock 
the plan would allow the company to double the number of 
existing shares and offer them to shareholders other than the 
acquirer at half the market price said northwest spokesman bob 
gibbons 
the effect would be to require a hostile bidder to buy twice as 
many shares to gain control of the company making the bid twice as 
expensive 
davis complained in his suit that the plan would improperly 
interfere with the solicitation of proxies he expected to conduct 
in advance of the may 15 shareholders meeting 
he is seeking an order to temporarily restrain nwa from 
distributing special stockbuying rights to shareholders under the 
pill 
davis owns 3 percent of nwas stock shortly before he made his 
offer northwest announced that a separate group of investors was 
interested in buying nwa the identity of that group which owns 
49 percent of the stock has not been disclosed

a house banking panel today amended president 
bushs savings and loan plan to encourage institutions to 
concentrate on housing lending but even supporters of the change 
acknowledged it was worded in a way that could allow sampls greater 
freedom 
the amendment sponsored by rep frank annunzio dill the 
chairman of the house banking subcommittee on financial 
institutions requires sampls to concentrate 80 percent of their 
lending on housing up from the current requirement of 60 percent 
but it very broadly defines the types of lending that would be 
used to meet the 80 percent standard to include consumer small 
businesses and education loans it also would not penalize any 
institution for its existing mix of investments even if that did 
not meet the requirement 
one can have the advantage of wanting to sound prohousing and 
still know that one supports greater latitude said rep john 
lafalce dny who supported the amendment 
annunzio said his measure will build homes and help revitalize 
our inner cities 
the 2618 vote approving it came as the subcommittee began its 
third day of drafting sampl legislation and the senate banking 
committee opened its billwriting session 
tresury secretary nicholas brady in a letter today to chairman 
don riegle dmich called the senate committees recommended 
changes on regulating the industry on balance meritorious but 
said the administration still objects to his plan to put 50 
billion of taxpayer cost in the bailout on the federal budget 
meanwhile the house lawmakers are rejecting bushs effort to 
make the savings and loan industry meet the same capital 
requirements as banks in return for bailing out the thrift industry 
by a 2716 vote the panel adopted changes advocated by rep 
stan parris rva that would make it easier for sampls through 
subsidiaries to invest in such risky areas as commercial real 
estate development and junk bonds 
rep jim leach riowa in opposing the amendment said its 
all about whether we want to support risk takers with government 
guarantees 
on tuesday the subcommittee rebuffed 2423 bushs insistence 
on doubling the required capital base of sampls from 3 percen to 6 
percent the same level that commercial banks have to meet 
but then in several votes against annunzio it endorsed 
elimination of several smoke and mirror accounting practices 
that allow sampl owners to meet the present capital standards with 
little or no investment of their own 
the senate committee before todays session had reached a 
bipartisan consensus behind closed doors on nearly all issues 
according to its chairman sen don riegle dmich 
one senate committee member speaking on the condition of 
anonymity predicted its version will be much tougher than whatever 
emerges from the house in regulating sampls in the future 
but riegle conceded in a letter to treasury secretary nicholas 
brady that financing the taxpayer portion of the bailout remains 
unresolved and committee sources speaking on the condition of 
anonymity predicted a partyline fight on the issue 
bush wants to raise the 50 billion immediate taxpayer share of 
the bailout through 30year bonds to be issued by a new 
quasigovernmental corporation as a way to prevent the costs from 
showing up on the federal deficit this year and next 
riegle with support from congressional auditors and 
acquiescence of senate budget chairman james sasser dtenn 
wants to put the bulk of the costs in the fiscal 1989 budget 
saying it would save taxpayers 45 billion in lower interest costs 
over three decades 
in his letter dated monday to brady riegle said he was aware of 
the treasury secretarys threat earlier this month that bush would 
veto the bill if the bailout costs are included in the 1989 or 1990 
budget deficits 
we have made substantial movement toward the administrations 
direction on the regulatory and structural aspects but have yet to 
see any flexibility from you on the funding dimension he 
complained 
in the house rep charles schumer dny has drafted an 
amendment similar to riegles financing scheme but schumer said he 
is waiting for the appropriate time to introduce it presumably 
after the senate committee has a showdown vote on the issue 
seven republicans on the house panel joined 17 democrats in the 
2423 vote tuesday rejecting bushs proposal to make sampl owners 
have 6 instead of 3 in capital for every 100 they lend out 
eleven democrats sided with 12 republicans in a failed effort to 
reject the adopted alternative scheme introduced by annunzio and 
parris 
the annunzioparris measure maintains the current 3 percent 
capital floor but for the first time requires that half that amount 
150 on every 100 in loans be real cash investment by sampl 
owners that can be recovered if the thrift fails 
annunzio cited federal home loan bank board estimates that 1100 
sampls would falter under bushs capital standards and claimed his 
measure is tougher in some ways because it requires owners to put 
their own money at risk

roughly 1000 the amount of outside income social security 
recipients are allowed to earn before facing benefit cutbacks

consideration today before a final vote on the minimumwage bill

final vote back until thursday 
passage of the amendment offered by sen william l armstrong 
rcolo also brought the senate bill far out of line with a 
housepassed bill meaning that after final senate passage a 
conference committee would be needed to draft a compromise 
the current outside earnings limit is 8880 for social security 
recipients 65 years of age or older after crossing that limit 
recipients lose 1 of benefits for every 2 in earned income 
the amendment would increase the limit for most of those 
affected to 9960 it would apply to social security recipients 
between the ages of 65 and 70 the earnings limit expires after age 
70 
most of the senators who spoke against the amendment said they 
supported its goal but questioned the appropriateness of adding it 
to the minimumwage bill they also said that benefits to thousands 
of social security recipients likely would have to be cut to pay 
for the proposal 
the amendment is not related to the mininum wage but senate 
rules do not prohibit tacking on other proposals to legislation 
being considered by the full body 
an impasse between president bush and the democratic 
congressional leadership that threatens prospects for a higher 
minimum wage has both sides trying to convince the public the other 
side is to blame 
bush has said he will veto the democratic plan a development 
that could lead to a ninth consecutive year without an increase in 
the minimum wage despite the first white house support this decade 
for some boost 
polls have shown the public overwhelmingly supports an increase 
a fact not lost during the partisan wrangling 
this legislation will be a test of whether we indeed are 
seeking a kinder gentler nation senate majority leader george 
mitchell said tuesday criticizing bush for refusing to budge from 
his proposal which would raise the minimum wage from 335 an hour 
to 425 an hour by january 1992 
mitchell said bushs kinder gentler campaign rhetoric is at 
odds with his opposition to the democratic bill particularly when 
the president is backing expanded tax breaks for capital gains 
enjoyed largely by the nations wealthy 
how can anyone justify wanting to give 30000ayear tax cuts 
to the richest americans and at the same time oppose 30 cents an 
hour more for the poorest americans said mitchell dmaine 
thats not right its wrong its unfair 
mitchell spoke just before the senate rejected bushs proposal 
5841 largely along party lines and instead amended a bill by 
sen edward m kennedy dmass to bring it more in line with the 
house bill that revision was approved 6139 
the administration fired back quickly with labor secretary 
elizabeth dole raising the prospect that the partisan squabbling 
would result in no increase in the minimum wage this year 
democrats have no one to blame but themselves mrs dole 
said the democrats decided theyd rather fight than win 
unfortunately the people who really lose are the ones who can 
least afford it 
in addition to favoring a smaller increase in the general 
minimum wage bush has insisted on letting employers pay new 
workers a subminimum training wage democrats who long 
opposed a subminimum agreed this year to include one in their 
proposal in hopes of making it more acceptable to the 
administration 
the kennedy bill as amended contains a provision allowing 
employers to pay new workers a subminimum wage for up to 60 days 
bush has insisted on a sixmonth training wage 
republicans however are confident a veto can be upheld and are 
in no mood for a compromise on the overall dispute 
there isnt going to be a compromise said senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas its going to be 425 an hour and a 
sixmonth training wage period

will buy apollo computer inc a pioneer in the engineering 
workstation market for 476 million in cash 
the purchase of apollo by hewlettpackard a manufacturer of 
computers and scientific equipment continues its push into the 
38 billion workstation market 
under the agreement hewlettpackard will offer 1325 per share 
for apollos estimated 36 million shares of common stock 
outstanding and will begin its tender offer within five business 
days 
the companies board of directors unanimously approved the 
definitive agreement that will merge two players in the engineering 
workstation market the fastestgrowing area of the computer 
industry 
workstations are singleuser computers that resemble personal 
computers but are usually faster and have larger screens with 
better graphics they were originally used mostly by scientists and 
engineers 
but the use of workstations which range in price from 5000 to 
100000 has spread to other professions such as financial 
analysis 
apollo a fortune 500 company founded in 1980 and based in 
chelmsford mass pioneered engineering workstations but fell 
behind sun microsystems inc in the rapidly growing market the 
company squeezed out a profit of 21 million last year on sales of 
654 million although it lost money in its second and third 
quarters 
after the secondquarter loss which surprised analysts roland 
d pampel resigned as president to become president of bull hn 
information systems inc 
apollos stock had risen earlier this year on speculation that 
it might be taken over possibly by bull hn information but the 
stock drifted back as the speculation faded apollo closed 
unchanged at 812 a share tuesday in overthecounter trading 
palo altobased hewlettpackard entered its 50th year of 
business in 1989 following a financially rosy 1988 when it reported 
a 27 percent jump in net income a 34 percent rise in earnings per 
share and revenue of 98 billion 
hp and apollo together represent an ideal blending of product 
strengths and business strategies said john a young 
hewlettpackard president and chief executive officer both 
companies are recognized for technical innovation and highquality 
computer products and for a commitment to the industrys move 
toward cooperativecomputing environments based on open industry 
standards 
the acquisition is agreement is subject to regulatory approval 
and the expiration of waiting periods 
apollo is extremely pleased to join forces with one of the

the loewenbraeu company of munich 
one of west germanys bestknown beermakers with origins that date 
to the 14th century is considering direct exports to the united 
states after watching falling sales of its licensed brew in america 
but loewenbraeu general manager and director peter wiedemann 
emphasizes direct export is just one option under consideration 
and praises the cooperation with licensing partner miller brewing 
co of milwaukee 
we have an excellent business and personal relationship with 
miller wiedemann emphasized in an interview with the associated 
press but he said that in an effort to raise flagging sales 
among the various options that we have there could also possibly 
be the resumption of direct exports 
he confirmed published reports that annual sales of the licensed 
loewenbraeu on the american market which began under a pact made 
in the early 1970s has dropped by nearly a third since then 
fritz kuhn a loewenbraeu spokesman said the licensed product 
is brewed in millerrun us breweries direct exports means 
loewenbraeu would ship its beer made in west germany to the united 
states 
the remarks by wiedemann and kuhn appeared to surprise officials 
at miller a leading american brewer which has a contract with 
loewenbraeu that runs through 1992 
quite frankly im really puzzled by what they said said 
beverly jurkowski a miller spokeswoman reached by telephone the 
very nature of that contract would prevent some of those other 
options from taking place 
she said miller and loewenbraeu officials conferred in february 
a meeting she said the west german company found highly encouraging 
the lowenbraeu general manager suggested that in the future 
both companies might collaborate on direct exports of loewenbraeu 
to the united states he declined to be more specific 
loewenbraeu already has formed a company in boston loewenbraeu 
marketing corp to study the possibility of direct exports and to 
look into other possibilities in the united states wiedemann said 
because our sales in the united states are down we must 
undertake decisive strategy changes the loewenbraeu executive 
said 
he acknowledged that the higher price for export beer is one 
consideration weighed by officials of the 606yearold brewery 
the general manager noted loewenbraeu is considering the 
purchase of a brewing facility on west germanys northern coast 
near seaports and much closer to the united states than the current 
facilities deep in southern bavaria 
that way we dont just have north america as a possible 
market we also have a substantial export business in the whole 
world wiedemann said 
he added the beer we would brew there if in fact we buy a 
brewery would be made according to the same recipe as we have here 
in munich 
the northern facility also could figure into loewenbraeus plans 
to become a dominant brand within this country of 613 million 
people 
among the approximately 1150 breweries now in germany there 
is none with a market share of more than 5 percent there are so 
many suppliers and there is no truly national brand he said 
end adv for weekend editions april 1516

most grain and soybean futures prices closed 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade amid rumors of new 
soviet buying interest in the wheat market 
but oat futures retreated reflecting the abundance of foreign 
oats available on the us market 
crop futures were buoyed early in the session by an agriculture 
department report indicating the nations grain stockpiles were 
declining more rapidly than most analysts had believed 
rumors surfaced at midday that the soviet union was eyeing new 
purchases of us wheat which would be a significant development 
because the soviets have already purchased all the us wheat 
earmarked for sale to them this year at subsidized prices 
the moderate decline in oat futures was overdue said jay homan 
an independent oat trader in chicago 
weve needed to divorce ourselves from the strength of the 
other grain markets he said theres a scarcity of american 
oats but an abundance of foreign oats 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 7 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 403 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
to 3 cents higher with may at 267 a bushel oats were 1 cents 
to 4 cents lower with may at 179 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents 
to 6 cents higher with may at 727 a bushel

bank holding company on wednesday reported a 36 percent drop in 
its first quarter profit over a year ago

for the three months ended march 30 compared with earnings of 280 
million or 152 per share in the 1988 period 
the first quarter of 1988 included a gain of 43 million related 
to a federal tax refund

most effected was net interest income which tumbled to 299 
million in the first quarter from 438 million a year ago 
total noninterest income also declined to 394 million from 
435 million while noninterest expenses eased to 436 million 
from 511 million

million against 50 million a year ago it said total allowances

smithkline beckman corp and britains 
beecham group plc announced wednesday they would merge and form the 
worlds secondlargest pharmaceutical company but a wall street 
analyst warned that either firm could find itself a takeover target 
before the transaction is completed 
smithkline and beecham who confirmed earlier this month they 
were negotiating on a merger said they would exchange stock and 
establish a pharmaceutical and health care giant with estimated 
sales of 67 billion 
the new company to be named smithkline beecham would rank 
second in worldwide pharmaceutical sales behind merck amp co second 
in overthecounter medicines behind american home products corp 
and fourth in animal health 
the firm will have a research and development budget of more 
than 500 million per year smithkline chairman henry wendt said at 
a news conference 
we will have one of the best and largest research and 
development organizations in the world drawing on the scientific 
skills and traditions of the united states and britain he said 
under the merger agreement smithkline shareholders would 
receive five b shares of stock in the new company for each of 
their old shares and beecham shareholders would receive slightly 
less than one a share for each of their old shares 
the new shares would have equal voting rights in the affairs of 
smithkline beecham but dividends paid to each a share would be 
about five times the dividends paid to each b share 
smithkline currently has some 133 million shares outstanding and 
beecham has about 768 million shares outstanding 
two smithkline subsidiaries allergan an eye and skincare 
business and 84 percent of beckman instruments which makes 
diagnostic and laboratory equipment would be spun off to 
smithkline shareholders the companies said in a joint statement 
smithkline last fall sold 16 percent of beckman through a public 
stock offering 
beecham plans to sell off its cosmetics and fragrance divisions 
plus other nonpharmaceutical businesses officials said 
smithkline shareholders would receive a onetime cash dividend 
of 550 per share they also would get about half a share of 
allergan and about 018 shares of smithkline stock for each 
smithkline share according to a news release 
the merger would be subject to governmental approval and a vote 
by shareholders of both companies 
smithkline stock fell 2 in new york stock exchange composite 
trading wednesday closing at 6275 a share 
a financial analyst specializing in pharmaceutical companies 
said the merger announcement could draw new bids for either company 
before stockholders vote four months from now 
to quote yogi berra it isnt over till its over said 
ron nordmann of painewebber group inc in new york i think 
thats why they attempted to announce this deal in all due haste 
other companies mentioned as possible suitors for smithkline are 
hoffmanla roche amp co nestle sa imperial chemical industries and 
du pont co 
wendt said smithkline had received no other offers 
there have been no feelers no nudges no cloakroom 
conversations he said when pressed on the question 
but normann said the announcement could change the situation 
think how short the concept of this merger has been in the 
public domain he said and its such a large deal 11 to 13 
billion depending on what you think about the pieces 
now x y z who ever that might be knows exactly what the 
terms are that they have to top 
wendt 55 chairman and chief executive officer of smithkline 
would become chairman of smithkline beecham and robert bauman 
chairman of beecham would become chief executive officer of the 
new company 
the two companies executed agreements wednesday to copromote 
several products including smithklines popular ulcer drug 
tagamet beecham was granted a license to sell the drug under its 
own brand name 
beecham which makes tums antacid pills is particulary 
interested in developing an overthecounter version of tagamet 
bauman said 
building on the tums franchise an overthecounter 
formulation of tagamet has the potential to become a global 
brand he said in a statement released by smithkline 
smithkline reported total sales of 47 billion in 1988 while 
beechams sales exceeded 4 billion 
the new company would be based in london with offices in 
philadelphia

palladium futures prices surged to their highest level in nearly 
5 years wednesday on new yorks mercantile exchange amid optimism 
that recent nuclear fusion experiments could spur demand for the 
metal as an ingredient in the power plants of tomorrow 
other preciousmetal futures prices also advanced 
on other markets cocoa futures plunged gasoline prices rose 
but other energy futures were mixed grains and soybeans were 
mostly higher and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
palladium settled 440 to 515 higher with the contract for 
delivery in june at 17365 a troy ounce the move marked 
palladiums first foray above 170 since december 1983 when the 
metal reached nearly 180 a troy ounce 
palladium prices have risen in 10 of the 13 trading sessions 
since march 23 when two chemists announced they had achieved 
nuclear fusion at room temperature using palladium as a catalyst in 
an experiment at the university of utah 
fusion is the joining together of hydrogen atoms to produce 
enormous amounts of energy it is the process that powers the sun 
and stars and scientists seeking a cheap energy source have long 
sought to harness it 
last week palladium for june delivery went as high as 169 an 
ounce only to collapse on friday amid skepticism about the utah 
findings 
but on monday researchers at texas aampm and georgia tech 
announced they had replicated at least part of the university of 
utah results bringing new buyers into the usually quiet palladium 
market 
some of the buying interest in palladium spilled over into the 
platinum market wednesday 
the rally in palladium created a psychological environment 
which was conducive to rallies in the other precious metals said 
george anagnos an analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc in 
new york 
but analysts said the moderate rise in gold and silver futures 
was more likely a response to inflation jitters and signs that the 
dollars recent strength has peaked 
platinum settled 330 to 380 higher on the new york merc with 
may at 53180 a troy ounce on new yorks commodity exchange gold 
settled 220 to 240 higher with june at 39210 a troy ounce 
silver was 32 cents to 42 cents higher with may at 5895 a troy 
ounce 
cocoa futures plummeted on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange on rumors that the ivory coast the worlds largest cocoa 
producer had sold an unknown quantity of cocoa through the swiss 
trade house intercafco which denied any such deal 
cocoa settled 30 to 56 lower with may at 1272 per metric ton 
unleaded gasoline futures rose sharply for the fourth straight 
day on supply concerns the crude and heatingoil market were 
quiet 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 6 cents 
higher with may at 2064 a barrel heating oil was unchanged to 5 
cents lower with may at 5320 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
20 cent lower to 111 cents higher with may at 7011 cents a 
gallon 
most grain and soybean futures prices rose on the chicago board 
of trade amid rumors of new soviet buying interest in the wheat 
market 
but oat futures retreated reflecting the abundance of foreign 
oats available on the us market 
wheat settled 2 cents to 6 cents higher with may at 403 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with may at 267 a 
bushel oats were 1 cents to 4 cents lower with may at 179 a 
bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 7 cents higher with may at 727 
a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange weak cash markets and 
profittaking weighed on the cattle futures while pork futures 
advanced on ideas that farmers soon will be busy with spring 
planting and will be marketing fewer hogs 
live cattle settled 87 cent lower to 60 cent higher with april 
at 7645 cents a pound feeder cattle were 12 cent to 93 cent 
lower with april at 7640 cents a pound live hogs were 12 cent to

mexicos latest 365 billion loan from the 
international monetary fund will likely improve its standing in 
upcoming debt restructuring talks with commercial bank creditors 
bank executives said wednesday 
negotiations between the country and a 13member bank committee 
are set to begin april 19 in new york 
at that time mexico will formally propose a reduction in the 
value of its foreign debt a cut in servicing and additional 
lending over several years according to mexican treasury secretary 
pedro aspe 
he said mexico will offer banks the option of exchanging old 
debt for mexican bonds that discount debt principal and reduce 
interest rates 
mexico struggling to overcome the burden of payments to 
commercial banks and governments on its 107 billion foreign debt 
is the developing worlds secondlargest debtor behind brazil 
which owes 121 billion 
the threeyear agreement reached with the imf on tuesday is the 
first from the international lending community since treasury 
secretary nicholas brady outlined a debtreduction plan last month 
that he hoped would help ease payment terms on the developing 
worlds 132 trillion foreign debt 
william r rhodes a citicorp vice president said the imf pact 
is a positive signal as it forms an important part of mexicos 
economic program 
it will help facilitate negotiations with the bank advisory 
group next week he said in a statement 
the 365 billion imf loan will be used to bolster the countrys 
foreign exchange reserves and spur economic development 
aspe said the agreement is a fundamental change from the 
past since the imf recognizes mexicos need to set its growth 
priorities first and schedule debt servicing accordingly 
many bankers agreed that the pact amounted to an endorsement of 
mexicos economic policies which included tough inflationfighting 
programs 
mexico is a country that has made significant progress it 
deserves whatever kind of special treatment might be meted out 
said lloyd atkinson chief economist for the bank of montreal and 
an advisor to the bank creditors committee

the justice department announced wednesday 
that it settled allegations that citibank new york discriminated 
against foreignborn job applicants 
the issue was raised by the center for immigrants rights which 
brought the charges on behalf of a job applicant who wished to 
remain anonymous said lawrence siskind of the departments office 
of special counsel 
the center alleged that citibank was requiring that foreignborn 
applicants for bank tellers show green cards known formally as 
alien registration cards even though they already had provided 
adequate documentation to satisfy the requirements of the 
immigration reform and control act of 1986 
that act among other things required employers to ensure that 
they did not hire illegal aliens and threatened them with fines if 
they failed to do so 
in the case of citibank it was discriminating against 
foreignborn employees by forcing them to produce documents that it 
wasnt forcing its other employees to produce siskind said 
the ins deems drivers licenses school identity cards with 
photographs voter registration cards and draft cards among other 
documents as sufficient to establish identity 
although the allegation against citibank focused on just one 
individual siskind said we did learn that they had been doing 
it as a policy they had instructed their personnel people to do 
that but as soon as we began our investigation and informed them 
of the law they agreed to stop the policy 
the investigation began jan 27 and was settled monday he said 
in the settlement citibank agreed to accept any and all 
documents allowed by the ins to satisfy the requirement that the 
person is eligible for employment and agreed to treat all 
applicants and employees the same it will not pay any fine to the 
government or any back pay to the affected individual who was 
subsequently hired siskind said

ivan f boesky asked a federal judge to end his 
threeyear prison term but prosecutors wednesday refused to take a 
stand on releasing the former speculator at the center of wall 
streets insider trading scandals 
boesky who has already served one year in prison claimed that 
his help led to a record plea bargain deal by drexel burnham 
lambert inc and the subsequent indictment of its junk bond 
financier michael milken and others on racketeering and securities 
fraud charges 
boeskys lawyers on tuesday asked us district judge morris e 
lasker to reduce his sentence to time already served which would 
allow his speedy release 
the true fruits of ivan boeskys unsurpassed cooperation with 
the government are now for the first time dramatically fully 
and publicly known the court papers said 
the papers claimed boesky was to a significant extent a 
follower in a larger criminal conspiracy organized and operated 
by drexel and its highyield bond department headed by milken 
the 98count indictment of milken handed up march 29 alleged 
that the drexel bondsman illegally schemed with boesky to defraud 
clients and the investing public by manipulating stock prices and 
skirting federal securities laws during attempted takeovers 
in a letter to lasker who sentenced boesky in december 1987 
the manhattan us attorneys office said the government takes no 
position on boeskys move but acknowledged his cooperation in 
the almost threeyear probe into wall street corruption 
assistant us attorney jess fardella writing on behalf of us 
attorney benito romano noted that the fruits of his cooperation 
are now more vividly apparent to the public 
fardella described the milken indictment and the 650 million 
tentative settlement of criminal charges drexel reached with the 
government as the centerpiece of boeskys cooperation 
the letter continued boeskys disclosures were the essential 
catalyst for all that has been and remains to be revealed in those 
cases other investigations arising directly from boeskys 
disclosures have also matured since boeskys sentencing 
but it added that the government nevertheless articulated the 
value of that cooperation in unqualified terms when boesky was 
sentenced 
boesky attorney leon silverman said i will have no comment 
while its under consideration by the court 
once one of the leading speculators on the stock of potential 
takeover targets boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count as part 
of his plea bargain boesky 52 also agreed to pay a thenrecord 
100 million to settle civil insider trading charges brought by the 
securities and exchange commission 
on april 15 1988 boesky filed papers seeking a sentence 
reduction but asked lasker to defer action attorneys again 
deferred the request in october and said last week they planned to 
seek his release following milkens longawaited indictment 
the lawyers tuesday said that public blood lust at the 
time of sentencing couldnt be countered 
as the court recognized at sentencing it was impossible for 
the public or the press to understand the incalculable value of mr 
boeskys cooperation because the secrecy of the grand jury process 
precluded any public recitation of the value of the information 
that he had provided to the government it said 
boesky was eligible for parole march 21 two days before his 
oneyear anniversary inside the minimum security prison camp in 
lompoc calif where the onetime corporate titan is working as an 
orderly he has not yet sought parole 
boesky has supplied information used toward civil or criminal 
charges in more than a dozen case in the united states and britain 
in exchange boesky was allowed to plead guilty to one count of 
conspiracy to lie to the sec his earliest nonparole release date 
based on good behavior is april 4 1990 
at the time of sentencing prosecutors said boeskys threeyear 
term was an appropriate sentence in light of all the competing 
factors 
they also said that while boesky provided a window on the 
rampant criminal conduct in the securities industry he also 
engaged in serious and widespread criminal conduct

arthur andersen amp cos new chief executive 
announced the heads of the accounting giants restructured 
operations wednesday and said he was eager to pursue more business 
after a tumultuous year 
lawrence a weinbach confirmed last week to head the firm said 
the restructuring has created a consulting unit that will operate 
independently and on an equal basis with its accounting audit and 
tax business unit 
the consulting practice will be headed by george t shaheen 44 
who had headed its north american consulting business he had 
previously been the southeast regional managing partner 
the accounting audit and tax practice will be headed by richard 
l measelle 50 who had previously been managing partner for 
worldwide accounting and audit practice he has worked in 
andersens offices in detroit and spain 
both will report to weinbach 
the good news is that we have completed our restructuring 
successfully gaining consensus among our partners worldwide and we 
are moving aggressively forward weinbach said 
he said 89 percent of the partners voting on the restructuring 
approved it 
weinbach 49 a 28year veteran of firm who worked his way up 
through the accounting side was nominated last month and approved 
last week to succeed duane a kullberg as managing partner and 
chief executive of arthur andersen a privatelyheld firm based in 
chicago 
kullberg announced in january he was stepping down after nine 
years as head of andersen to help give the firm a new start as it 
embarked on a restructuring designed partly to end a rift between 
its accounting division and its more rapidlygrowing management 
information consulting division 
the consulting business accounted for roughly 40 percent of the 
firms 28 billion in revenue last year weinbach said revenue 
from from consulting rose more than 30 percent last year while its 
revenue from its tax practice was up 20 percent and audit and 
accounting revenue rose 14 percent 
this organization is back to work weinbach said adding the 
firm could once again focus full attention on competing in the 
marketplace 
under questioning he said the firm has lost no clients but said 
it may not have capitalized on marketplace opportunities 
during the past year andersen has been rocked by the defections 
of six consulting partners who have set up their own consulting 
business with assistance from the londonbased advertising giant 
saatchi amp saatchi plc 
andersen and information consulting group inc the firm formed 
by andersens former partners are suing each other each claiming 
business interference

the new and revamped products from the company which last year 
had a 283 percent share of the 4 billion annual workstation 
market are intended to capture a major share of the burgeoning 
commercial market for workstations by the mid 1990s the total 
annual workstation market is expected to be 20 billion for most 
of the last decade workstations were used primarily by scientists 
and engineers 
the companys success for its new line is pinned on its 
comparatively vast library of software available for it 
competitors so far have fewer few software packages for their 
machines 
the companys sparcstation 1 the socalled star of the new 
line will have the ability for an additional 500 to emulate the 
msdos operating system of microsoft corp that will allow the 
sparcstation to run popular programs written for ibm personal 
computers although at a lower speed 
sparcstation 1s 8995 pricetag does not include a disk drive 
its speed of 125 million instructions per second or mips is 
about four times the speed of the similarly priced highend 
macintosh from apple computer and more than twice as fast as the 
most powerful ibmcompatible personal computers 
previously suns fastest machine using socalled reduced 
instruction computing set technology or risc had a speed of 7 
mips and was priced at 22000 suns version of risc is called 
sparc 
the sparcstation 1 offers builtin digital audio capability 
eight megabytes of internal memory three expansion slots a 
blackandwhite screen and a size that is less than half the height 
of a traditional pc console a colormonitor version is available 
for 15500 
other new products announced included a revamp of the original 
sun3 workstation line with the addition of motorolas fast 68030 
microprocessor chip threemips machines that will start at 5995 
a 16mips workstation based on risc chips starting at 29900 and 
an equallyfast sparc system starting at 40900 that is designed 
to operate as a server to interact with many computers on a 
network 
prime computer inc announced wednesday that it plans to 
incorporate sparc technology in future engineering workstations 
with this strategy sun hopes to turn its sparcbased systems into 
an industry standard 
other manufacturers offer machines that compare with suns new 
models dec offers an eight megabyte internal memory workstation 
without disks with a speed of 14 mips for 11900 but no 
expansion slots data general offers one with 17 mips for 7450 
but with only four megabytes of internal memory and no expansion 
slots 
next incs machine at 9995 will offer five mips with three 
expanson slots and 256megabytes of optical disk storage capacity 
and eight megabytes of internal memory

the senate banking committee on wednesday 
unanimously approved president bushs 90 billion plan for bailing 
out the savings and loan industry after rejecting an effort by the 
panels chairman to dump the 50 billion immediate taxpayer portion 
of the cost onto the 1989 federal budget 
the 21member panel voted 1110 to establish a quasigovernment 
corporation for issuing 30year bonds to finance the governments 
share as bush wanted instead of the onbudget alternative 
advocated by banking committee chairman don riegle dmich 
democratic sens alan cranston of california alan dixon of 
illinois and jim sasser of tennessee sided with all but one of the 
committees nine republicans in favoring bushs plan over riegles 
but riegle himself admitted he had lost enthusiasm for the 
proposal after treasury secretary nicholas brady repeatedly told 
senate democrats throughout wednesday he would recommend that bush 
veto the legislation if it swelled the budget deficit 
sasser who met with brady throughout the day said the 
administrations opposition would have made the effort to solve the 
sampl crisis drag on for months 
the secretary of treasury was absolutely adamant there would 
be a presidentia veto and we would be back to square one sasser 
said 
earlier brady wrote a letter to senators in which he didnt 
repeat the bush veto threat but did say the administration opposed 
riegles plan 
rep charles schumer dny the chief advocate in the house of 
such a plan said he is holding off on proposing it after receiving 
a letter wednesday from white house budget director richard darman 
who said he would refuse to count all of the spending in 1989 
if darman carried out the threat it would wreak havoc on 
efforts to meet the grammrudman budget deficit targets in 1990 and 
1991 schumer said darman has the sole power to make that decision 
but said he was still looking for a way to circumvent him 
riege said his plan would avoid the accounting and budget 
gimmickry of bushs proposal by reducing the interest costs of 
financing the bailout through direct treasury borrowing at a 
savings of 45 billion to taxpayers over the next three decades 
utah sen jake garn the committees ranking republican said he 
still has a fundamental disagreement over allowing the bailout 
costs to swell the federal deficit in apparent violation of a 
congressionally mandated reduction target that already has been 
exceeded 
all three versions bushs the senate panels and one being 
put together in the house banking committees financial 
institutions subcommitee would use the 50 billion over the next 
three years to pay for the bailouts of some 200 insolvent sampls in 
1988 plus 350 more that are insolvent or nearly so 
they also provide for an additional 33 billion 300 million a 
year of it coming from the industry to take care of thrift 
insolvencies expected in the 1990s especially if interest rates 
continue to rise or the nation falls into a recession 
the president asked us to move quickly and thats what weve 
done riegle said weve given him a strong bill with many 
streamlined reforms and changes that can prevent in the future a 
repeat of whats happened in the past 
unlike changes made by the house subcommittee the senate 
panels version retains bushs proposal to double by june 1991 the 
required capital that sampl operators must have to qualify for 
federal deposit insurance 
bush would not shut down institutions that fail to meet that 
standard then but he would prevent them from growing both senate 
and house versions would allow undercapitalized thrifts to continue 
growing but would restrict that growth primarily to home mortgages 
and consumer loans 
the house panel which finished its third full day of drafting 
the bill rejected bushs measure to make sampls have the same 
minimum capital requirements as banks 6 for every 100 of 
outstanding loans voting 2423 tuesday to keep the current floor 
3 for every 100 in loans but requiring for the first time 
that half that amount be in real money 
both panels however have voted to phase out many of what 
critics call smoke and mirrors accounting fictions 
those accounting practices have allowed sampls to escape putting 
up their own cash or retained earnings by counting as capital such 
items as investments in nonthrift subsidiaries good will 
their own borrowings and even losses on bad loans 
bush would immediatly end many such bookkeeping practices 
by a 2716 vote wednesday the house subcommittee voted to 
continue allowing sampls to funnel depositors fund into subsidiaries 
to invest in risky areas such as commercial real estate 
development fast food franchises and junk bonds 
the senate panels version would phase out such practices over 
five years but there were disagreements among senators over whether 
to do it in equal yearly installments or all at once 
the house panel also approved wednesday a measure by its 
chairman rep frank annunzio dnj requiring sampls to 
concentrate 80 percent of their lending on residential mortgages 
compared with the 60 percent now required 
but the measure also broadly defines housing to include 
consumer education and small business loans and no sampl would be 
penalized if the mix of its current loan portfolio does not meet 
the requirement 
the subcommittee also approved 3412 a measure sponsored by 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the full committee 
which would require the government to offer some of the repossessed 
property from failed sampls for housing poor people it authorizes 
spending 574 million to subsidize rents on the properties or offer 
discounts or lowinterest loans to purchasers 
it adopted another measure by voice vote imposing government 
oversight on the agency in charge of selling repossessed real 
estate and establishing procedures designed to guard against the 
dumping of the property at firesale prices

peter v ueberroths proposed 464 million 
purchase of strikebound eastern airlines collapsed wednesday but a 
federal bankruptcy judge immediately moved to attract new buyers 
for the carrier 
the former baseball commissioner told a news conference his deal 
fell through following an impasse tuesday night with easterns 
unions and its parent texas air corp 
we are extremely disappointed this transaction collapsed last 
night and is done ueberroth told a news conference our 
agreement with texas air is terminated its finished its over 
his announcement squelched a stunning but shortlived effort to 
buy one of the nations most unprofitable and striferidden 
airlines which has been mired in an emotional strike and 
bankruptcy proceedings for more than a month 
eastern president phil bakes said the miamibased airlines 
strategy now was to reorganize as a smaller carrier serving roughly 
50 percent to 60 percent of its prestrike schedule of 1040 
flights a day and employing some 15000 to 18000 people compared 
with 31000 before the strike 
bakes refused to answer whether the airline would consider new 
buyout offers he denied that a competing offer had been made by 
trans world airlines chairman carl icahn who nevertheless has 
indicated he remained interested 
but shortly after the announcement us bankruptcy judge burton 
r lifland ordered the parties involved in the sale to show why he 
should not throw the airline open to all bidders and include with 
it certain assets texas air has bought or transferred from eastern 
since acquiring it in 1986 
the order is based on a petition by an eastern creditor atlanta 
attorney moreton rolleston jr that seeks to block the sale of 
easterns northeast shuttle for 365 million to developer donald 
trump 
the petition also seeks to require that any purchase of eastern 
be for 615 million the amount texas air paid for it in 1986 
include all of its system one computerized reservation system 
which it sold to texas air and include aircraft it has transferred 
to sister carrier continental airlines 
lifland scheduled a hearing monday on the matter for all parties 
involved in easterns bankruptcy case and ueberroths attorneys 
the key issue blocking the sale to ueberroth was who would run 
the airline in an interim period between the completion of a deal 
and the airlines emergence from bankruptcy 
we were not able to bridge this hurdle although both of us i 
think tried to do that ueberroth said 
according to a participant in the talks who asked not to be 
identified courtappointed examiner david i shapiro recommended 
monday that us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland name former 
defense secretary frank carlucci trustee 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo objected to the appointment of 
any trustee and lifland refused to name one without explaining why 
the source said 
easterns unions have accused lorenzo of gross mismanagement and 
of stripping eastern of vital assets since texas air bought the 
airline in 1986 and have refused to return to work while he was in 
charge the pilots and machinists already have petitioned lifland 
to appoint a trustee 
henry duffy president of the air line pilots association 
issued a statement from washington saying the union was 
disappointed and noting the problems that caused the strike 
remained unresolved 
this is but one act in a multiact play and the bankruptcy 
judge still is running the proceedings duffy stated 
im disappointed to say the least said wally haber a 
machininsts union general chairman in miami i can tell you right 
now mr lorenzo would have walked away in this deal with a lot 
more money than he put into eastern airlines obviously theyve got 
some plans to milk some more out of eastern 
at eastern corporate headquarters management employees gathered 
around television sets and expressed relief 
it looks like we move on to another phase veteran spokesman 
james ashlock said i do think there is a certain release of 
anxiety here at the base where a great many people particularly 
the noncontract people were increasingly concerned at the way the 
situation had been building 
lifland met earlier wednesday with attorneys for eastern its 
unions and the ueberroth group to try to save the deal saying it 
represented a historic opportunity to salvage one of the nations 
biggest airlines 
any deal would have required full agreement from ueberroth 
lorenzo easterns three unions and easterns creditors 
eastern has been flying only a fraction of its schedule since 
its machinists union began a strike march 4 that has been supported 
by its flight attendants and pilots unions 
in a related development wednesday a federal judge in miami 
upheld the easterns pilots participation in the machinists strike 
the ruling by us district judge edward davis seriously hurt the 
companys effort to get the airline flying again 
davis said he saw no evidence that alpa would have gone on 
strike if the machinists hadnt 
the company said it would ask the federal appeals court to 
reject davis opinion but pilots union attorneys said appellate 
courts historically accept such findings of fact by lower court 
judges 
eastern sought bankruptcy protection march 9 because of a cash 
crisis stemming from the walkout and pressure from creditors 
lorenzo has been trying to peddle the airline since then and has 
indicated there have been other overtures 
icahn who has been approached previously by easterns 
machinists about making an offer issued a statement wednesday 
saying he remained interested in eastern however he stated 
although i might be willing to risk my capital in eastern i 
would not be willing to pay it over to texas air 
icahn was not available to elaborate on the statement his 
secretary said 
texas air also has indicated it received a conditional offer 
from jay pritzker head of the hyatt hotel chain after initially 
getting ueberroths bid 
meanwhile a manhattan diamond dealer said he has formed a 
partnership with an unidentified foreign airline that he said could 
raise more than 250 million by the end of the week for a bid 
willy censor 62 said he had met with officials from eastern 
and us bankruptcy court to discuss his proposal for buying the 
strikebound carrier eastern attorney david boies confirmed he met 
with censor but declined to say whether the airline was taking the 
bid seriously 
ueberroth emerged as the buyer earlier this month and a deal 
appeared virtually assured especially after his group reached 
labor agreements with easterns striking unions following 
negotiations this past weekend 
but negotiations with texas air began to deteriorate tuesday 
amid sometimesheated discussions with shapiro lorenzo and 
ueberroth walked out of discussions at bankruptcy court that 
evening hours before their selfimposed midnight deadline for 
reaching agreement 
under fiveyear deals reached with ueberroth on monday the 
three unions the machinists alpa and the flight attendants union 
would have received 30 percent ownership of the airline in 
exchange for about 210 million in concessions

hewlettpackard co moved to seize 
leadership in the 4 billion computer workstation market wednesday 
announcing an agreement to buy apollo computer inc for 476 
million in cash 
hewlettpackards surprise announcement stole some thunder from 
rival sun microsystems inc which had chosen wednesday to announce 
what it called the most significant new products in its history 
apollo and hewlettpackard together would have 304 percent of 
the burgeoning workstation market capturing the lead from sun 
which has 283 percent according to dataquest inc a san 
josebased research firm 
the workstation market is expected to grow at a 30 percent clip 
through 1993 according to alea fairchild an analyst with 
dataquest 
workstations are singleuser computers that resemble personal 
computers but are usually quicker bigger and with larger screens 
and better graphics they were originally used mostly by scientists 
and engineers but are being increasingly targeted to everyday 
personal and business use 
it signals a real major commitment on our part to the 
workstation portion of our business said richard watts director 
of marketing in hewlettpackards computer products sector 
hewlettpackard will offer 1312 per share for apollos 
estimated 36 million shares of common stock outstanding and will 
begin its tender offer within five business days 
apollo shot up 462 to 1275 a gain of more than 50 percent 
in heavy overthecounter trading of 10 million shares 
hewlettpackard fell 75 cents to 5350 in consolidated new york 
stock exchange trading 
the deal requires regulatory approval and the tender of at least 
51 percent of apollo stock by shareholders 
apollo a fortune 500 company founded in 1980 and based in 
chelmsford mass was the pioneer of computer workstations but 
has suffered setbacks in the race with sun and lost money in two 
consecutive quarters last year it squeezed out a profit of 21 
million for the year as a whole on sales of 654 million 
apollo will likely operate as a division within 
hewlettpackards workstation group once the acquisition is 
completed which should be in 90 days said watts 
apollo chairman and ceo thomas a vanderslice termed the 
transaction a winwin situation for both companies he said he 
did not foresee major layoffs resulting from the purchase 
hewlettpackard said it will benefit from apollos strength in 
computer networking and its large customer base and motivated 
workforce 
hewlettpackard will bring its strength in the graphics area to 
apollo which could use the help as well as financial resources 
that includes 98 billion in revenues last year 
the hewlettapollo thing was pretty astonishing said 
michael murphy a senior analyst and editor of san franciscobased 
california technology stock letter what hewlett i think is doing 
here is building a lot of customer relationships that they are then 
going to migrate over into the unix world 
workstations run on unix an operating system that excels in 
communications and the ability to carry out multiple tasks 
simultaneously 
the announcement came as sun microsystems rolled out a line of 
sparcstation computers that boast sophisticated new graphics and 
digital sound plus higher speeds and a circuit board that allows 
fullmotion video on a computer screen it also launched a family 
of sun3 workstations 
i think that maybe is purely coincidental but it is 
interesting timing said barry f bosak an analyst with new 
yorkbased smith barney harris upham amp co 
i think it buys hewlett more visibility in an interesting 
market they certainly have the money to do it and apollo did need 
financial help said bosak who called the 476 million a fair 
price 
hewlettpackard had 169 percent of the 198788 market share and 
apollo had 135 percent dataquest said

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo said 
wednesday he turned down peter v ueberroths proposed purchase of 
eastern airlines because a takeover by a trustee was bad for the 
airlines shareholders 
lorenzo gave his reasons for the purchase collapse to columbia 
university graduate students at a lecture that was closed to the 
media 
ueberroth offered 464 million for the strikebound airline and 
the deal for a time seemed likely until talks broke down for good 
over the issue of who would control the airline as it emerged from 
bankruptcy 
easterns unions demanded that the courts appoint a trustee but 
lorenzo refused 
he blamed it the collapse on the unions said michael 
danitz 27 he felt he should have been running the airline in 
the interim he felt he was better qualified being in the airline 
business than somebody whos a trustee of the court 
steve mazzari 27 another student said lorenzo gave the 
audience a historical perspective on the eastern troubles and then 
explained why the uebberoth deal did not fly 
lorenzo told the students he wanted to run the company until 
we can pay our shareholders he said he said he was looking 
for the best deal in the interest of the shareholders he thought 
hiring a trustee was not in their best interest 
another student who asked not to be identified said lorenzo told 
them he planned to sell some of easterns assets and that will be 
better for the shareholders 
about 100 protesters marched outside uris hall where lorenzo 
spoke for 20 minutes about the airline industry since deregulation 
and then answered students questions for another 40 minutes 
one protester carried a sign that read frankie smooth talk 
59 some things never change lorenzo was graduated from 
columbia in 1959 
the executive avoided the protesters by going through an 
underground entrance to address the lecture which had been 
scheduled since november as part of the universitys distinguished 
lecture series 
marieodile taillard chairwoman of the series said lorenzo had 
asked that reporters not be among the 250 to 300 graduate business 
students who warmly applauded him at the conclusion of his lecture 
but not all the students were impressed 
i went in there with a pretty bad impression of him and it 
didnt change said one student who asked not to be identified 
he felt he was a scapegoat he blamed everybody else for the 
situation he seemed very unemotional the student said 
outside striking eastern pilot harry maclaughlin 58 marched 
with other protesters as four security officers checked student 
identification cards at the buildings front entrance 
hes a brilliant person a financial wizard maclaughlin 
said of lorenzo but he treats his employees in a demeaning 
manner 
danitz said one student asked lorenzo what the students should 
do if they someday find themselves embroiled in a difficult labor 
situation 
if its a nonunion place dont let them in danitz quoted 
lorenzo as saying 
he said if management is doing a good job theres no reason 
for unions to come in danitz said
