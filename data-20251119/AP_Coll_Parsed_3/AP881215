president reagan on thursday defended opening a 
dialogue with the plo calling it just another step in the 
middle east peace process and saying israel shouldnt worry about 
americas commitment to its security 
but reagan also said he would not hesitate to break off 
communications if yasser arafats palestine liberation 
organization reneged on its acceptance of israels sovereignty or 
its renunciation of terrorism as an instrument to achieve policy 
objectives 
during separate oval office picturetaking sessions with turkish 
prime minister turgut ozal and italian prime minister ciriaco de 
mita the president said he decided to reverse his longstanding 
opposition to contacts with the plo on the basis of statements that 
arafat made in geneva on wednesday 
when asked if he thought that israel was justified in being upset 
with his administrations move reagan replied well i dont 
think so in the sense that we have made it very plain that we have 
not retreated one inch from our position of guaranteeing the safety 
of israel 
acting on the instructions of secretary of state george p 
shultz the us ambassador to tunisia robert h pelletreau jr 
called the director general of the political section at the plos 
tunis headquarters to try to make arrangements for the talks us 
officials said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that at 
this point there has been no substantive response in terms of time 
place or location 
state department officials later said that talks with the plo 
probably would begin in tunis on friday afternoon 
on capitol hill leading members of congress gave the new opening 
a wary welcome and they joined reagan in seeking to reassure israel 
that us officials will be alert to any plo tricks 
this is good news and the right path to follow said sen 
claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee i think we would best be very careful that the plo 
continue to show real seriousness and be wary of any decepion 
sen george mitchell dmaine the newly elected senate majority 
leader welcomed the us move and called it a significant step 
toward advancing the peace process 
reagan said the administration agreed to open a substantive 
dialogue with the plo after it became satisfied that arafat had 
complied with the us conditions for such direct contacts 
asked to explain the policy reversal the president said well 
because the words have been spoken and the words were the words 
that we have been stating were necessary but he said of 
course the words must be matched by performance and if theyre 
not why were back where we started 
questioned about what he would do if the plo failed to live up to 
its commitments reagan said well wed certainly break off 
communications he stressed that the ultimate solution in the 
middle east does not depend on outsiders or us 
peace must be brought about by the involved nations meeting 
with each other and settling their differences he said 
asked why the united states does not recognize a palestinian 
state reagan said because there is no such thing as of now 
there isnt a palestinian state and if you recognize someone as 
that it would be us declaring who was in charge there 
reagan said commencing exploratory talks with the plo was just 
another step in what weve been trying for eight years to bring 
about peace in the middle east 
presidentelect bush told reporters he supported reagans 
decision 
i havent spelled out any hopes about it he added arafat 
met the conditions of the united states and we will go forward with 
a dialogue not negotiations but a dialogue lets see how 
things evolve 
as for the discussions bush said theres no game plan 
theres no fivepoint program 
asked if he would prefer that the talks wait until his 
administration starts next month bush replied i am vice 
president of the united states i become president on jan 20 on 
jan 21 ill tell you what i want to do 
the us announcement late wednesday left israel in diplomatic 
isolation and came just a few hours after bush had taken a tough 
line against the plo declaring it failed to meet the us 
conditions 
but reagan and shultz said that arafat in statements made in 
geneva about the same time that bush was speaking had met the us 
conditions for a substantive dialogue a form of diplomatic 
acceptance long sought by the palestinian group 
only a day earlier the state department had said arafat failed 
to meet the us conditions and less than three weeks ago shultz 
had accused the plo of terrorism said arafat was an accessory to 
such terrorism and denied the plo leader an entry visa to address 
the un general assembly in new york 
the united states long has insisted that the plo accept un 
resolutions adopted in 1967 and 1973 affirming the right of all 
states in the middle east to live in peace israel is not 
specifically mentioned the united states also has demanded that 
arafats organization renounce terrorism and accept israels right 
to exist 
white house spokesman fitzwater said us officials would move 
cautiously into the dialogue with plo representatives and that 
the talks would establish a foundation for the organization to 
prove that they have changed their ways 
its too early to speculate on how these things might take 
place he said this is a first step and how the followon 
steps will evolve we really dont want to draw parameters at this 
point 
we did have strong feelings about the plo and we still have 
strong feelings fitzwater said but he said the administration 
decided to permit contacts because there has been evidence of 
change

theres a moment in clint eastwoods movie 
bird when the great jazzman charlie parker stands on a 
blackened paris stage after finishing a concert consuming massive 
doses of applause and sniffing a longstemmed red rose 
he was something of a god to jazz zealots but perhaps the 
tortured musical genius never really got a chance to wake up and 
smell the roses he mutilated his life with drugs and alcohol and 
died at the age of 34 in 1955 
eastwood who has loved jazz since his childhood and who always 
wanted to film a portrait of parker attempts to harness the birds 
creative spirit and all the creative juices of that time a time 
when bebop came to the fore and brought jazz into the modern age at 
the same time it pokes into the underbelly of the jazz world with 
its stark portrayal of drugs alcohol debauchery 
his life was obviously filled with many excesses sort of a 
dichotomy eastwood says how a person who can be so brilliant 
and who spent hours and hours to become as great as he did and have 
that kind of discipline could not in any other part of his life 
that was always a wonder to me 
but i wanted a movie where you root for him i just wanted 
to explore the fact that he was brilliant and innovative and the 
other just became a part of his life 
eastwood even films bird in a dark brownish hue 
most of the jazz world is nocturnal he says tv 
unfortunately has shown a whole generation that flat light is the 
only way i dont like flat light i like the feel of the movie i 
like to look into a film instead of having it look out at you i 
approached the color of it in terms of black and white 
forest whitaker good morning vietnam platoon is 
gentle yet fierce playful yet obsessed in his role as parker for 
which he was awarded the best actor prize at the cannes film 
festival it was well deserved for a stunning performance that even 
captures the hunched body stances once assumed by the musician as he 
performed as chan parker diane venora ironweed fx 
finds the right balance between free spirit and strong loving wife 
who battles her husbands philandering and personal demons and at 
the same time champions his work and wellbeing 
bird followed the success of last years round midnight 
the story of an expatriate sax player in paris tenor saxophone 
great dexter gordon who once worked with parker received an 
academy award nomination for his role as the tragic dale turner 
though based loosely on the late jazz musician bud powell bertrand 
taverniers movie is a universal story of jazz artists who fled 
bigotry and rough times in america for the allure of paris and 
amsterdam during the 1940s 50s and 60s 
paris blues martin ritts 1961 jazz movie starring paul 
newman and sidney poitier takes a more romantic hollywood 
approach the late duke ellington received an oscar nomination for 
his score 
in bird lenny niehaus did the score which isolates parkers 
original playing of laura april in paris ornithology 
parkers mood and other jazz tunes and remixes his recorded 
solos with contemporary musicians including bassist ron carter 
trumpeter john faddis pianists walter davis jr and barry harris 
jazz purists have been rankled by the soundtrack which they say is 
technically excellent but misses the interplay between parker and 
his sidemen 
but eastwood defends his decision if youre going to do a film 
and have stereophonic sound you need to record well charlie never 
had the opportunity to do stereophonic sound 
charlie parker was born in kansas city and took up first 
baritone and then alto sax while still in high school which he left 
at the age of 14 so he could study such greats as lester young and 
count basie in the local clubs he soon found himself in new york 
where a young trumpet player named dizzy gillespie was all the rage 
with thelonious monk and bud powell on piano kenny clarke on 
drums and later a young miles davis on trumpet parker and gillespie 
helped define and create a new musical venture in jazz bebop 
parker whose nickname was yardbird and shortened to bird 
stumbled into the lost world of night life but even with the 
debiliation of drugs and alcohol he never failed to solve musical 
problems and invent new directions 
there have been no great harmonic changes in jazz since charlie 
and dizzy eastwood says 
and then he muses what musical levels would parker have reached 
today had he lived it would be interesting the actorfilmmaker 
says

the rage of hong kong these days is easy to 
spot just look for the tiny antennas the telltale sign of the 
portable telephones so many people are carrying wherever they go 
despite price tags of 2000 or more the handheld telephones 
have become a huge hit in this british colony where doing business 
is a 24hour preoccupation and new status symbols are always in 
demand 
downtown streets are filled with professionals ready for business 
with the cellular phones tucked under their arms or stuffed 
antennaup into briefcases 
away from the financial district people can be seen barking into 
the phones while eating in restaurants riding public buses and 
ferries or sitting in darkened movie theaters everyone from 
executives to proprietors of produce stalls can be seen chatting 
away 
the hong kong standard newspaper spotted a telephone in a recent 
100kilometer 62mile charity walk along a rural trail 
in driving rain and a lashing wind a young man was spotted 
eagerly and conspicuously talking into his mobile telephone it 
said 
in a more normal society one would expect him to hand the 
phone over to one of his seconds before starting the race but a 
few kilometers down the track the young man was spotted merrily 
informing the financial markets at large of his continued 
existence 
the government estimates about 60000 portable cellular 
telephones roughly six times earlier projections will be in use 
by the end of the year in this territory of 57 million people said 
deputy postmaster general henry wise whose department is in charge 
of telecommunications 
while most cellular telephones sold in other countries are for 
use in cars roughly threefourths of the units sold in hong kong 
since the market opened three years ago have been the more expensive 
handheld models 
we were amazed when the whole thing really took off in a great 
way wise said 
hutchison telephone co which has sold about 26000 cellular 
telephones recently stopped sales for six weeks because demand was 
outpacing the companys capacity to handle all the calls 
the market just caught everybody by surprise said peter 
grant president of china telephone co ltd a rival firm were 
all frantically rebuilding networks 
harry hui a psychology lecturer at the university of hong kong 
attributed the popularity of the telephones here in part to the 
importance of face its a status symbol 
wise believes the hong kong work ethic of doing business whenever 
and wherever possible is largely responsible for the tremendous 
sales 
virtually the whole day is part of the working day he said 
although industry officials see no end in sight to demand for the 
telephones their indiscriminate use in public places already is 
viewed as an irritation by some 
people are becoming aware of the annoyance factor 
acknowledged grant 
several exclusive clubs demand that their patrons and guests 
check their telephones at the door

pub conversations in dublin where people 
are fond of their drink and free with their opinions are likely to 
be spiced with some regret these days 
irelands whiskey industry the worlds original is now owned by 
the french 
losing its treasures to outsiders principally the conquering 
vikings and english is no new experience for this small island 
nation 
today with liquor industries around the world tending to 
consolidate and with ireland a member of the european economic 
community losing a major industry to an eec partner is perhaps 
inevitable 
but it hurts all the same 
irish distillers group plc which makes all the worlds irish 
whiskey and calls itself the spirit of ireland was won on nov 
24 by the french liquor company pernod ricard sa after a sixmonth 
battle with a hostile bidder the grand metropolitan plc liquor 
company of britain 
the news is by no means all bad analysts say a fair price is 
being paid for irish distillers shares its 1100 employees jobs 
are assured and the future looks brighter for its brands which 
include jameson paddy and bushmills 
but over a neat measure of irish whiskey or a pint of dark 
frothy guinness at odonoghues arguably dublins most famous pub 
its the losses not the gains that come to mind 
i would obviously be disappointed when a company based in 
ireland becomes owned by someone other than irish people said 
mary mcevoy echoing the sentiments of several customers shouted 
over lively irish music 
ms mcevoy a mental health worker is reticent about her age 
but not about her preferred whiskey bushmills 
irish whiskey is one of the most traditional products that this 
country exports said frank fell chief executive of the licensed 
vintners association we were anxious to maintain the integrity 
of irish spirits the main problem we were concerned with was that 
the company would be broken up 
the issue was important enough for the government to step in and 
ensure that pernod ricard did not alter the irish whiskey industry 
which is a monopoly or sell off brands without official approval 
irish distillers sought out pernod ricard as a friendly bidder to 
fend off grand met which offered 499 million pernod ricards 
offer was lower at 442 million but it promised to safeguard jobs 
and develop brands while grand met said it intended to dispose of 
at least one brand 
grand met threw in the towel after several regulatory and court 
rulings in pernod ricards favor but retains a stake in irish 
distillers limited by the government to 30 percent 
the battle for irish distillers has been a headlinemaking event 
and very stressful for the companys workers 
certainly everybody had views about it but the overwhelming 
feeling we got was of support said irish distillers managing 
director richard burrows 
so is irish whiskey still irish 
i dont think people will feel any different burrows said 
with pernod ricards support well be able to go on with the 
development of our brands i think its a good thing for the irish 
industry 
but burrows in an interview at the companys dublin 
headquarters conceded i do have a twinge of regret that irish 
distillers is not remaining an independent irish company there is a 
lot of heredity and tradition 
the secret of perfume distillation reached ireland in the 6th 
century and monks soon figured out how to use it for making whiskey 
irish distillers origins date to 1608 when old bushmills which 
claims to be the worlds oldest distillery was licensed in northern 
county antrim 
in 1966 john power and son merged with john jameson and cork 
distillers bushmills joined the group in the 1970s creating the 
monopoly 
irish distillers suffered in the 1980s from the abstinence trend 
and profits have been hurt by attempts to expand sales abroad 
but sales now are growing here and overseas burrows said in the 
six months ended march 31 the company produced a 40 percent 
yeartoyear gain in net profit to 98 million or 15 cents a 
share on an 8 percent gain in revenue to 197 million 
with 1635 million standard cases in the year ended sept 30 
1987 irish whiskey captured 36 percent of the spirits market in 
ireland and imported whiskeys accounted for 12 percent irish 
whiskey sales outside ireland came to nearly 1 million cases 
the scotch whisky industry shipped 75 million cases in 1987 
regrets aside the overwhelming emotion at the company is relief 
that the suspense is over and that the friendly bidder prevailed 
i just feel the best people won said rachel odonnell 25 a 
receptionist at irish distillers largest bottling plant in 
clondalkin outside dublin 
said burrows there will be continuity but certainly there 
will be certain changes 
in the meantime nothing is going to interfere with irishman 
willie doyles plans 
ill still have my paddy doyle said as he stepped off to his 
favorite pub yes odonoghues and yes his eyes were smiling

the city was hit with a 60 million lawsuit 
wednesday alleging negligence on the part of fire department 
paramedics who did not treat a 9yearold boy who eventually died 
from an asthma attack 
fire department spokesmen claim the ambulance was pelted with 
eggs and rocks and paramedics were forced to retreat when they 
arrived at a housing project monday 
all the evidence we have says there was nothing being thrown at 
the paramedics attorney michael bledsoe said they just flatly 
refused to go up to the apartment 
bledsoe filed a lawsuit on behalf of sharon jarnagin whose son 
carl died the lawsuit asks for 10 million in actual damages and 
50 million in punitive damages 
a city attorney michael lyons said he was aware of the lawsuit 
but had no comment 
the paramedics summoned by an emergency call at 416 pm 
monday were not aware of the seriousness of the asthma attack when 
they first arrived at the housing project the fire department says 
they left the scene and returned 24 minutes later when police 
arrived according to the fire department 
police officers said they found the boy in a bedroom in the 
familys fifthfloor apartment he was taken to a hospital where he 
was pronounced dead 
fire department employees tuesday washed the ambulance used by 
the paramedics removing any trace of egg that may have been on it 
bledsoe said 
when we heard about it we got a protective order barring anyone 
from doing anything to the ambulance until we could inspect it he 
said 
the order was issued wednesday by cook county judge lester 
foreman 
fire department spokesman tom sheppard said tapes of 
communications between the paramedics and dispatchers show proof 
that the ambulance was hit by flying objects 
at all times paramedics and emergency medical technicians 
should avoid placing themselves in danger sheppard said reading 
a city policy 
the boys mother and neighbors insist there was no danger to the 
paramedics

amateur astronomers using home computers and 
highpowered binoculars were able to track the us space shuttle 
atlantis as it deployed a secret spy satellite 
if we could figure it out you could bet that the russians 
figured it out too says ted molczan a selfdescribed space 
enthusiast who helped organize the tracking 
although he said the information gathered had little practical 
use the project showed secrecy is a rare commodity in the sky 
in washington david garrett of the national aeronautics and 
space administration said we dont comment on secret satellite 
launches 
molczan 35 said in a recent interview that the satellite 
watchers are hobbyists who work together informally trading 
information through telephone calls letters and electronic mail 
the secrecy of the atlantis early december mission made their 
research challenging and intriguing detective work molczan said 
as space enthusiasts for us to see the space shuttle is a very 
exciting thing he said adding that he was thrilled by the rare 
prospect the shuttle would be visible over canadian skies 
shuttle orbits generally are farther south 
molczan is an engineering technologist who specializes in energy 
conservation his interest in space is visible in his sparsely 
furnished 23rd floor apartment a computer and charts lie on his 
desk books on the subject cram a bookcase and highpower binoculars 
sit on a stand near the door 
the binoculars said molczan are more useful than telescopes for 
satellite watching because they are easier to point and have a wider 
field of view 
molczan had been in contact with about 150 other satellite 
watchers from as far away as australia about the atlantis probable 
orbit he circulated information including a test yourself page 
to make sure all participants could handle the necessary 
calculations 
the toronto skies were cloudy on dec 2 the day of the atlantis 
launch and molczan was unable to see it passing over others did 
and the calls started coming in while the craft was on its sixth 
orbit in the late afternoon 
there were two sightings from the toronto region and one from 
ashtabula ohio 
to get three confirmations like that in the space of half an 
hour was very exciting molczan said we had more than a dozen 
people in this area looking for it 
knowing the times of the sightings allowed him to calculate the 
height of the orbit and with the computer he quickly was able to 
determine where the shuttle could be seen for the rest of the 
mission 
molczan said the watchers sighted only the atlantis on the sixth 
revolution and the satellite was sighted by the seventh revolution 
three miles ahead of it continued sightings showed that for two 
days the shuttle stayed close to the satellite which was observed 
to have a reddish color 
he said it was very satisfying to determine that the satellite 
known as lacrosse was deployed on the shuttles first day in orbit 
the news media was speculating that it would be released on the 
second day 
the mission went the way we hypothesized it would molczan 
said 
the industry magazine aviation week and space technology reported 
last week citing defense department sources that the 500 million

the last five italian warships have left 
the persian gulf in the latest and largest cutback of foreign naval 
forces following the iraniraq ceasefire italian officials say 
the frigate euro flagship of the italian flotilla and the 
minehunters castagno and loto sailed through the strait of hormuz at 
the mouth of the gulf last week the defense ministry in rome said 
wednesday 
they were bound for home 
the frigate sagittario and the supply tanker stromboli left nov 
24 and reached their home port at the taranto naval base in italy on 
monday the ministry said 
italian officials announced the withdrawal in early november 
saying the aug 20 ceasefire which halted fighting in the 
8yearold war had brought a consolidation of stability to the 
strategic waterway 
italy deployed warships in the gulf after the italian container 
ship jolly rubino was attacked by iranian gunboats while sailing to 
kuwait on sept 2 1987 italy kept up to eight ships in the gulf at 
once 
the jolly rubino was the only italianflag vessel among more than 
500 ships attacked by both sides during the fouryear tanker 
war iran regularly intercepted ships suspected of carrying 
warrelated cargoes for iraq during the war 
the italian departure reduced the number of foreign warships in 
or near the gulf to about 50 with half belonging to the united 
states at its peak late last year the foreign naval force 
comprised more than 70 ships from seven countries

two derailed railroad cars leaking highly 
explosive liquid propane wednesday forced the evacuation of about 
100 residents and closed an interstate highway and rail routes in 
northern arizona 
a total of 26 cars derailed early wednesday about 10 miles east 
of flagstaff after 84 santa fe railroad co cars somehow became 
uncoupled during a stop said a company official 
residents near the derailment were told at about 11 am to plan 
to spend at least 24 hours away from their homes while authorities 
tried to defuse the cars leaking liquid propane 
this has the potential to become a very dangerous situation 
said coconino county sheriff joe richards 
he said hazardousmaterials teams from the santa fe railroad co 
and the state department of public safety hoped to siphon off the 
propane through a makeshift rigging of pipes and valves and ignite 
it in a controlled burn 
they cant offload it because that would be too dangerous 
richards said its too dangerous to move heavy equipment in there 
because of the potential for an explosion 
but later in the day santa fe spokesman mike martin said that 
hazardous materials experts were considering an alternate strategy 
an intricate process of pumping the propane out of the leaking 
propane cars with special equipment 
the process would take up to 36 hours he said if it is used 
the propane would be taken by truck and would be reloaded on 
different tank cars later martin said the experts hoped to decide 
on a stragegy by early thursday he said 
the residents evacuated earlier wednesday would not be allowed to 
return to their homes until the propane was completely removed 
authorities sealed off both the railroad rightofway and 
interstate 40 over the 58mile stretch between flagstaff and 
winslow by late evening wednesday the road and railroad remained 
closed 
state police helicopters also closed off the airspace over the 
wreckage chasing away aircraft carrying photographers 
an amtrak spokesman said the derailment held up two trains 
two other cars carrying propane one with a hazardouscargo 
label and 21 others derailed but they were not leaking the car 
with the hazardouscargo label was believed to be carrying an 
industrial solvent and was not considered explosive officials said 
santa fe spokesman mike martin said the train was parked at the 
ralston purina petfood plant in east flagstaff to drop off one car 
when the cars became uncoupled and began rolling east down a slight 
grade 
the runaway reached an estimated 40 mph before the cars derailed 
on a curve no one was injured he said 
investigators began a probe to determine why the train sections 
became separated but the cause was not immediately determined 
martin said the westbound train originated in kansas city mo

a congressional study places the largest 
government estimate yet on the price of bailing out the nations 
failing savings and loans and says the cost could soar even higher 
unless action is taken quickly 
the general accounting office says the government should spend 
112 billion to close failed institutions and abandon its current 
strategy of trying to keep the institutions alive through assisted 
mergers 
gao said the federal savings and loan insurance corp or fslic 
will need 85 billion over and above the 27 billion it expects to 
collect in fees from sampls through 1998 
however the congressional auditing and investigative agency 
warned that the pricetag will be even higher if interest rates rise 
most economists expect rates to climb through the middle of next 
year but offer no firm predictions beyond that 
the investigative agency in a draft of a report to the house 
banking committee sharply criticized the federal home loan bank 
board regulator of the nations 3000 sampls for attempting to 
rescue failed sampls by providing money to private merger partners 
the report noted that the insurance fund spends on mergers about 
90 percent of what it would cost to simply close insolvent 
institutions and pay off depositors however mergers do not always 
resolve the problem and counting tax losses to the government may 
well be more costly it said 
regulators and congress have resisted massive closings of 
insolvent savings and loans in the hope that the fortunes of these 
institutions would reverse themselves it said this hope has 
proven both futile and costly 
it noted that industry losses totaled 94 billion in the first 
nine months of this year 
the gao said failed sampls should be placed into receivership in 
the next year and most of the 112 billion should be spent in the 
next three years 
the bank board has avoided that approach arguing that massive 
closings could leave some areas of the nation without service from 
an sampl and that a flood of repossessed real estate from failed 
institutions could deepen the regional recession in the southwest 
breaking down the 112 billion the gao said 77 billion will be 
required to close insolvent but still open sampls which numbered 
434 at the end of september previously gao and the bank board had 
estimated that closing insolvent sampls would require about 50 
billion 
the new report also cites additional expenses including 10 
billion needed to finance borrowing by the fslic which guarantees 
sampl deposits up to 100000 and 5 billion likely to be required 
for losses that have occurred but havent been discovered yet an 
additional 20 billion should be set aside as a reserve against 
future losses gao said 
the thrift industry can contribute 5 billion to 10 billion but 
the rest may have to come from the federal government unless 
others such as commercial banks and depositors are required to 
share the cost the gao said 
the report did not specifically recommend a taxpayer bailout 
saying only that congress must make difficult choices however 
it warned that continuing an extra fee charged sampls for deposit 
insurance over and above what competing commercial banks pay 
could weaken healthy thrifts and thereby prove selfdefeating 
separately the treasury department is working on its own 
recommendation to the incoming bush administration and congress 
reagan administration sources have said the treasury is considering 
a plan to borrow the money through a newly created agency keeping 
most of the spending out of the federal budget deficit 
the gao recommended at this time against merging fslic with 
the federal deposit insurance corp which backs deposits in 
commercial banks 
gao strongly advises against further weakening the deposit 
insurance system through a merger in which fdics reserves and 
premium income both of which are needed for bank problems are 
simply diverted to cover some of fslics losses it said 
however the report said healthy sampls that want to change 
themselves to commercial banks and join the fdic should be allowed 
provided they pay the appropriate fees to the fslic 
the gao is circulating its draft report for comments and hopes to 
issue the final version in january or february 
charles j koch chairman of the national council of savings 
institutions an industry trade group called the gao 
recommendations provocative and refreshing his group 
represents many savings institutions which are already members of 
the fdic and others which would be healthy enough to transfer

aerospace employment declined by 21000 jobs in 
1988 as the industry recorded its first annual sales drop in 17 
years according to the aerospace industries association 
the reason is a substantial decrease in sales to the department 
of defense hardly a surprise in view of the zerotonegativegrowth 
defense budgets of the last four fiscal years the associations 
president don fuqua said wednesday 
overall sales volume was projected to reach 111 billion for 
1988 a reduction of slightly more than 1 billion from last year 
an analysis of orders on hand indicates a defense sales rebound 
in 1989 but we look for further substantial declines as we move into 
the early years of the 1990s fuqua said the sales projection for 
next year is for 129 billion but our real inflationadjusted 
sales curve for the next few years will be relatively flat 
according to fuqua 
statistics released by the association said the number of jobs in 
the aerospace industry will drop to 1307000 for the year and that 
there will be 14000 fewer jobs still in 1989 
we did not set a new record for sales for the first time in 
17 years fuqua said 
still industry profits were expected to improve to 51 billion 
and the backlog of unfilled orders to reach an alltime high of 
1703 billion the association said 
an increase in civil aerospace business fuqua said will offset 
the military decline 
we must face this fact fuqua said at the joint aia and 
aviationspace writers association luncheon the bush 
administration and the new congress must continue to accord top 
priority to further reduction in the national budget deficit 
so barring an unexpected change in the international climate 
we must realistically anticipate lower levels of defense 
appropriations and therefore reduced industry sales of defense 
equipment 
fuqua said american industry is severely handicapped in 
international competition by trade restrictions imposed by its own 
government he called the governments role purely administrative 
and often obstructive when it should be an active supporter of 
us exports 
he announced creation of a foundation to be called the national 
center for advanced technology which will pull together everything 
being done in technology and create a data base for companies and 
agencies taking part

ptl founder jim bakker expressed concern 
wednesday that his former evangelistic empire would vanish but 
officials of ptls successor group continued negotiating with their 
new landlord to salvage some part of the ministry 
the fate of the television ministry and church at fort mill 
sc was left up in the air tuesday when stephen mernick a 
34yearold orthodox jew purchased the ptl assets for 65 million 
since last year the facilities have been leased to heritage 
ministries a nonprofit religious group created by the bankruptcy 
court 
in a statement wednesday bakker accused in a federal indictment 
with misusing millions of dollars of his followers money said he 
was concerned that mernick would ignore the rights of ptls 
socalled lifetime partners who contributed 1000 or more to the 
ministry in exchange for free lodging at heritage usa ptls lavish 
religious theme park at fort mill 
our hearts are broken over the fighting over heritage usa that 
was built to bring people together in gods love bakker said 
tammy and i still have as our goal to restore heritage usa and all 
lifetime benefits to the partners who built it 
but heritage ministries president sam johnson who has met with 
mernick three times since monday said wednesday that he expects no 
immediate changes 
he mernick was very conciliatory in his tone said johnson 
who also is pastor of the church 
the ministry is the heart and soul of heritage usa he said 
when you take out the heart all you have is a cadaver 
heritage ministries officials told viewers of wednesdays 
broadcast of heritage today the successor to the ptl club 
they would continue in their effort to buy all the assets of ptl 
we want to be prepared in any event said johnson explaining 
that a number of developments could occur before the deal was final 
some assets he mernick may not be interested in 
meanwhile wednesday an attorney for one of the unsuccessful 
bidders for ptl charlotte broadcasting executive cy bahakel said 
his client will fight the sale in court 
we are going to contest irregularities in these proceedings 
and we are very firm in our intention to do that said the lawyer 
faison barnes 
tuesday in bankruptcy court in columbia mernick raised his 
offer to 65 million after being the high bidder at 3625 million 
at an auction the previous day reynolds then accepted the offer 
when bahakel who showed up about 25 minutes late asked to be 
allowed to bid 70 million reynolds turned him down bahakels 
lawyer said wednesday that mernick should not have been allowed to 
raise his bid 
johnson indicated that the money the group raised in an 
unsuccessful telethon effort to buy ptl reportedly about 5 
million may be used to buy the assets it needs to maintain the 
ministry 
mernick would not answer questions tuesday about the future of 
heritage ministries but said he would unveil plans in the next two 
weeks for ptls assets which include the satellite network carried 
on 800 cable systems 1700 acres of undeveloped land a 500room 
hotel a water park and the 2000seat church 
when he entered the ptl bidding in october mernick said he was 
interested in the assets purely as a real estate deal 
the charlotte observer quoting sources close to mernick said he 
intends to hold onto the undeveloped land for 10 years as its value 
rises 
johnson said mernick told officials of heritage ministries he is 
interested in maintaining the retreats atmosphere 
hes extremely sensitive to the people who have invested 
johnson said 
meanwhile bakker faces a bond hearing thursday on the indictment 
issued last week 
jim toms one of the ptl founders attorneys said he does not 
expect his client to enter a plea until next month toms has said 
previously that bakker would plead innocent to all charges 
a federal grand jury on dec 5 indicted bakker and his former top 
deputy at ptl richard dortch on 24 counts of wire and mail fraud 
and conspiracy the panel has accused bakker and dortch of diverting 
more than 4 million in ptl money to support their own lavish and 
extravagant lifestyles 
two other former aides brothers david and james taggart each 
were indicted on six tax charges 
bakker 48 resigned as ptl president in march 1987 after it was 
revealed he had a sexual tryst in 1980 with new york church 
secretary jessica hahn and paid her to keep quiet about it

presidentelect bush who ran for the white 
house as a washington insider is staffing his administration with 
just what youd expect washington insiders 
bushs announcement wednesday that he is tapping reagan 
administration trade representative clayton yeutter to be his 
secretary of agriculture is just the latest example 
he is retaining richard thornburgh as attorney general nicholas 
f brady as secretary of the treasury lauro cavazos as secretary of 
education william webster as cia director and marlin fitzwater as 
the white house spokesman 
james a baker iii a longtime bush associate who served reagan 
as white house chief of staff and secretary of the treasury will be 
secretary of state in the new administration 
richard darman an aide to baker at both the white house and the 
treasury department will head the office of management and budget 
the national security adviser will be brent scowcroft who had 
the same job in the ford administration 
it is not unheard of for newly elected presidents to pick people 
with washington experience to do washington jobs 
but no administration in recent memory has had so many retreads 
as the one now shaping up 
i think they are his kind of people said austin ranney 
chairman of the department of political science at the university of 
california george bush is an old washington hand and these are 
the people he feels comfortable with 
bushs whole argument this fall was im the insider i 
understand how government works i can handle things said david 
caputo professor of political science and dean of humanities at 
purdue university 
that campaign contrasted sharply with those of his two 
predecessors 
ronald reagan ran as the ultimate washington outsider often 
telling audiences that government far from being the solution to 
their problems was part of the problem 
even reagan picked some veterans of the washington scene his 
first secretary of defense for instance was fellow californian 
caspar weinberger who had been budget director and secretary of 
health education and welfare in the nixon administration most of 
his initial choices however were people like donald t regan 
picked to be treasury secretary after a career on wall street and 
william clark who jumped from a seat on the california supreme 
court to the no 2 job in the state department 
jimmy carter the former georgia governor and peanut farmer also 
took pride in his status as a stranger to the washington scene 
carter aide hamilton jordan said before the election 
if after the inauguration you find a cy vance as secretary of 
state and zbigniew brzezinski as head of national security then i 
would say we failed and id quit but thats not going to happen 
it did happen and he didnt quit 
but vance a former secretary of the army and deputy secretary of 
defense and brzezinski an academic with strong ties to the 
washington foreign policy establishment were also exceptions 
more typical of carters choices was bert lance the georgia 
banker he chose to head the office of management and budget 
regan clark and lance all had their troubles in washington 
regan the former wall street executive was fired as reagans 
chief of staff after a presidential board blamed him for many of the 
white houses troubles in the irancontra affair 
clark the former california judge was ridiculed after he was 
unable in his senate confirmation hearings to name the prime 
minister of south africa or express a view on nuclear 
nonproliferation foreign aid or us relations with third world 
countries he was confirmed anyway and satisfied reagan well enough 
that the president later made him national security adviser and then 
secretary of the interior 
lance left the carter administration under a cloud of alleged 
past banking irregularities then was acquitted of those charges by 
a federal grand jury 
clark and lance were past associates in state government of the 
former governors who appointed them people they knew and trusted 
bushs background for the past 20 years has been in the 
washington orbit as a member of congress ambassador to the united 
nations republican national chairman us representative in 
peking director of the central intelligence agency and vice 
president 
he too however apparently wants some familiar faces around him 
many of the people he knows well personally and he probably 
implicitly trusts them said political scientist caputo 
he doesnt want high risk

the sudden us decision to deal with the 
palestine liberation organization raises tough political problems 
for israel and suggests disarray within the reagan administration in 
its final weeks 
even while secretary of state george p shultz and other senior 
officials were making preparations at the white house for 
wednesdays historic announcement presidentelect george bush was 
criticizing the plo for failing to meet us conditions for a 
dialogue 
speaking at the executive office building just across the street 
bush vowed to continue the reagan administrations tough stand 
against yasser arafats organization he demanded a clear and 
unambiguous statement explicitly recognizing israel renouncing 
terrorism and accepting two major un security council resolutions 
on the right of all states to live within secure boundaries 
before we have a dialogue with the plo the signals have to be 
clear unmistakable unambiguous bush said biting off each word 
with decisive crispness 
simultaneously however arafat was giving a news conference in 
geneva that shultz seized on as evidence that the plo chairman had 
come around to accepting the us conditions 
the result was announcements by president reagan and by shultz 
that there would be a substantive dialogue with the plo in tunis 
leaving bush looking like the odd man out 
shultz meanwhile did not explain later at a state department 
news conference how what arafat said on wednesday had differed from 
what the plo leader had said a day earlier the dayearlier comments 
had been declared unacceptable 
having denied arafat a visa less than three weeks earlier shultz 
suddenly was approving direct dealings with a man he had denounced 
as an accessory in acts of terrorism against israelis and 
americans 
asked what was different about arafats most recent statement 
shultz said cryptically it was clear it was not encumbered 
the decision was in a long state department tradition of policy 
shifts that always are defended as not policy shifts at all 
it clearly backs israel into a corner now standing alone in 
shunning the plo shultz said he would not presume to advise another 
country what it ought to do 
its totally for israel to make its own decisions about what it 
wants to do and theres nothing to be inferred judgmentally about 
what they should do he said 
the choice israel faces is to watch the united states its 
closest friend make arrangements for mideast negotiations with the 
plo and not participate or to agree to attend a peace conference 
with the participation of the palestine liberation organization now 
a virtual certainty 
the plo could come under pressure too from the united states 
to make good on arafats declaration renouncing terrorism in all 
forms 
bush undoubtedly will be asked by reporters in the next few 
days why he seemed so out of step with what was brewing within the 
white house in a way though he may benefit from the decision 
taken by the outgoing reagan administration 
any political storm caused by embracing the plo will not fall on 
him its a decision that may have been inevitable and one he now 
will not have to make 
but he may have to make one just as tough whether to support a 
palestinian state 
shultz said he was not endorsing statehood for the palestinians 
by approving the dialogue and yet the plos demand for a state 
carved out of israeliheld territory will be bolstered by its entry 
into americas diplomatic community

the actor has been filming a detective series for abctv called

filming near the police station or any other government building and 
restrict filming to streets wider than 30 feet 
some residents had asked the council for a complete ban 
robert grace who served on the council from 197084 said 
filming in palm beach might encourage some kook or criminal to 
come over here and do some dastardly act 
i dont think this town should be a movie set for burt reynolds

attract the kind of people we dont want here people who are not 
going to spend any money here because number one they probably

here is the text of the statement by secretary 
of state george p shultz on wednesday in which he announced the 
united states will establish a dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization 
shultz the palestinian liberation organization today issued a 
statement in which it accepted un security council resolutions 242 
and 338 recognized israels right to exist in peace and security 
and renounced terrorism as a result the united states is prepared 
for a substantive dialogue with plo representatives i am 
designating our ambassador to tunisia as the only authorized channel 
for that dialogue the objective of the united states remains as 
always a comprehensive peace in the middle east in that light i 
view this development as one more step toward the beginning of 
direct negotiations between the parties which alone can lead to 
such a peace 
nothing here may be taken to imply an acceptance or recognition 
by the united states of an independent palestinian state the 
position of the us is that the status of the west bank and gaza 
cannot be determined by unilateral acts of either side but only 
through a process of negotiations the united states does not 
recognize the declaration of an independent palestinian state it is 
also important to emphasize that the united states commitment to 
the security of israel remains unflinching 
q mr secretary what was it today that changed your mind 
shultz i didnt change my mind they changed their they made 
their statement clear so that it doesnt have the ambiguities in it 
that earlier statements had which tended to allow various people to 
give different interpretations of what was meant 
q well what was different what was different about it today 
shultz it was clear it was not encumbered 
q mr secretary what about the plos record which only two 
weeks ago you described as a terrorism record you called arafat an 
accomplice or an accessory to terrorism you denied him a visa are 
you expunging the plo record and saying let bygones be bygone 
shultz no when we have our dialogue you can be sure that the 
first item of business on our agenda in that dialogue will be the 
subject of terrorism and well make it clear that our position 
about the importance of the renunciation of terrorism is central 
q but what can a dialogue do about people who are already dead 
and what does your statement have how does your statement bear on 
the promise kissinger made the israelis 
shultz the promise that kissinger made the israelis which had 
to do with 242 and 338 and with the recognition of israels right 
to exist since that time we have added our insistence on a 
renunciation of terrorism those conditions have been us conditions 
for a dialogue with the plo going back to 1975 our position has not 
changed we have stayed with that position consistently and now 
today we have an acceptance of those conditions in a clearcut way 
q mr secretary have you told the state of israel of your 
intentions and can you tell us what their response was 
shultz everybody has been put on notice repeatedly for since 
1975 in effect that if the plo meets our conditions then were 
prepared for a substantive dialogue that is wellknown 
of course we have had communications with israel as we have with 
other states and we have been engaged in the last hour or so of 
trying to call people to tell them explicitly what we are prepared 
to do now that there is this statement but i dont want to try to 
speak for others im only speaking for the united states 
q do you have any reason to believe that the israelis would be 
willing to sit down with the plo 
shultz no i dont have any reason to believe that but all im 
telling you is what the us policies are and this policy has been 
in place for since 1975 and it has been consistently adhered to 
and now that we see a change in the posture of the plo all were 
doing is following through on that policy our policy remains 
unchanged

q mr secretary do you see this as a single meeting or as the 
beginning of a process in which there will be a series of meetings 
and aimed at what result if it is going to be a series of meetings 
where do you want it to go 
shultz the meetings are not an end in themselves our object is 
a comprehensive peace and so our object in any dialogue that we have 
with the plo will emphasize our desire for that and our views of 
what it takes to get there i made a speech last september on behalf 
of the united states and set our views as a supplement to the views 
contained in the initiative that we worked on earlier this year 
so our object is not a dialogue our object is peace and we will 
be talking to the plo as to others in an effort to move things along 
toward that objective 
q mr secretary kissinger was at the white house this morning 
was that why he was there to 
shultz no it wasnt 
q mr secretary 
shultz however i did talk to secretary kissinger since we got 
word of this development 
q mr secretary your statement at the american colony was 
addressed specifically to palestinian residents in the west bank and 
gaza and not specifically not to the plo does this dialogue with 
the plo now mean that the united states is prepared to address that 
sort of statement to the plo leadership as well as to other 
palestinians 
shultz that was a statement to palestinians that i made in 
jerusalem last spring as i remember do you have the date of it in 
mind i forget its been a while ago anyway i sought a meeting 
with palestinians and i went to their turf so to speak and they 
would not meet and of course the word we got was that they were 
afraid to meet because they were afraid to meet because they were 
afraid they would be killed if they did so i went and i made a 
statement that you referred to saying here is what i would have 
told you if you had come and we issued that statement as a 
statement of our efforts toward peace and of our recognition which 
has been consistent and its obviously so that if youre going to 
get to a peaceful settlement in the middle east you have to include 
palestinians in the process from the beginning and at the end that 
is clear enough and that was basically what i said 
q as a result of this mr secretary are you going to be 
willing to talk with mr arafat before you leave office 
shultz what i am doing is authorizing our ambassador in tunisia 
to make himself available for a direct dialogue and we are making 
it clear that this is the only authorized channel of communication 
so anybody else who is representing themselves as a channel is not a 
channel this is the authoritative channel representing the united 
states government 
now what may evolve from this remains to be seen but i think 
that when it comes to any genuine substantive discussion we are in 
a transition phase and it is basically for the next administration 
to decide what they do 
q when will the first meeting be held 
shultz i dont we have seen this plo statement im making 
this response on behalf of the president i might say the 
president the vice president agree with this and im authorizing 
now the ambassador in tunis to undertake this dialogue but when 
there will be a meeting i dont know 
q off mike the united states has recognized the plo as the 
legitimate partner for negotiations do you feel that theres any 
reason for israel not to negotiate with the plo 
shultz what we are doing as a result of the plos meeting our 
conditions is establishing a substantive dialogue with them we 
hope that that dialogue may help bring about direct negotiations 
that will lead to peace how those negotiations are structured who 
is there to speak on behalf of the palestinians is a subject thats 
a difficult one weve worked on it a long time 
and i imagine itll continue to be difficult but at any rate 
well have a dialogue with the plo and that dialogue will be 
designed to find the answers to those questions 
q now that the plo has recognized israels right to exist and 
the un resolutions and renounced terrorism do you feel theres any 
reason that israel should not now talk to the plo 
shultz i israel has its own views and own policies and israel 
has always made it clear that these conditions that are us 
conditions are not necessarily theirs so i am not in any way 
speaking for israel its totally for israel to make its own 
decisions about what it wants to do and theres nothing to be 
inferred judgmentally about what they should do im only saying 
that for the period since 1975 the us has had a position in 
effect that if the plo meets these conditions we will have a 
substantive dialogue and since they have met the conditions we are 
carrying through on our policy and thats the sum and substance of 
it 
q have you conferred with the incoming administration since you 
have insisted that you are in a transitional state and would you be 
able to tell us whats their stand on it 
shultz the president and the vice president both have followed 
these developments very closely and they have reviewed each of them 
this most recent development and they both agree that under these 
circumstances the conditions for a substantive dialogue which we 
have had in place since 1975 have been met and so we should state 
that we are ready to undertake that dialogue now as far as what 
will be the efforts of the administration of presidentelect that 
is for them to determine and that remains to be seen 
q thank you 
q sir is this a condition of the plo 
shultz i have been dismissed 
mr redman charles redman state department spokesman thank 
you all

the international wheat council is forecasting 
that world wheat production could rise to a record level in the 
198990 season and start a modest rebuilding of depleted grain 
stockpiles 
but an official of the us national association of wheat growers 
says the councils assertion is premature and that is too early to 
make such projections 
the council said wednesday that wheat production could reach a 
record 550 million metric tons in the 198990 season that would be 
5 million tons more than is expected to be consumed and would allow 
world stocks to rebuild said the council 
a decline in stocks after the estimated fall of 37 million tons 
this season would leave an uncomfortably narrow margin of security 
between world supply and demand the council said 
if the council is correct about 198990 wheat production 
exceeding use once again and starting another buildup in surpluses 
it could mean downward pressure on wheat prices 
the agriculture department has not made any such projections yet 
our tendency over time is to have more faith in the usda 
projections said carl schwensen the associations executive vice 
president here the wheat council projections have a constituency 
of developing countries that they inform through their various 
forecasts 
schwensen added in a telephone interview whether it exceeds 
consumption or not i think its heroic to make any predictions 
about that at this point 
stockpiles built up during the wheat glut of the mid1980s are 
being depleted this season because of the sharp drop in 198889 
wheat production caused by droughts in the united states and canada 
world wheat production for 198889 now is forecast by the council 
at 500 million tons 13 million tons below the previous seasons 
figure and 37 million down on the 198687 record 
tighter supplies this season have led to higher world prices 
which are encouraging growers to increase plantings for 198990 the 
council said 
the usda has forecast global wheat production this season at 
5025 million tons about in line with the councils estimate for 
198889 but usda has not yet projected world wheat output for 
198990 
but department officials have been saying that the recent higher 
prices and drawdown of wheat stocks are expected to boost plantings 
for next season

an agriculture department report says that even 
if depleted soil moisture is replenished the effects of the 1988 
drought will continue to be very much in evidence next year 
because of the disruptions is has caused 
net cash income the difference between cash expenses and cash 
gross receipts is expected to be down somewhat from this years 
nearrecord 57 billion to between 48 billion and 52 billion 
but the departments economic research service said that would 
still put 1989 net cash income at the fourthhighest level on record 
economists say net cash income was high in 1988 despite the 
drought because so many farmers sold off commodities harvested in 
earlier years and because of large federal payments 
total crop and livestock receipts in 1989 are expected to rise 
slightly from this years record level the report said 
as a result of the drought and the draining of stored 
inventories farmers may boost crop plantings by as much as 30 
million acres but that will increase production costs government 
payments are expected to decline 20 percent to 25 percent

here is the text of president reagans 
statement on the palestine liberation organization as issued 
wednesday by the white house 
the palestine liberation organization today issued a statement in 
which it accepted united nations security council resolutions 242 
and 338 recognized israels right to exist and renounced terrorism 
these have long been our conditions for a substantive dialogue 
they have been met therefore i have authorized the state 
department to enter into a substantive dialogue with plo 
representatives 
the palestine liberation organization must live up to its 
statements in particular it must demonstrate that its renunciation 
of terrorism is pervasive and permanent 
the initiation of a dialogue between the united states and the 
plo representatives is an important step in the peace process the 
more so because it represents the serious evolution of palestinian 
thinking toward realistic and pragmatic positions on key issues 
but the objective of the united states remains as always a 
comprehensive peace in the middle east in that light we view this 
development as one more step toward the beginning of direct 
negotiations between the two parties which alone can lead to such a 
peace 
the united states special commitment to israels security and 
well being remains unshakeable indeed a major reason for our entry 
into this dialogue is to help israel achieve the recognition and 
security it deserves

the transportation department says it has no 
plans to investigate further the financial fitness of eastern 
airlines denying a request from the airlines unions who claim the 
company is being stripped of its assets 
the department said wednesday that eastern has demonstrated 
that it has the financial strength to operate safely and without due 
risk to consumers and no formal fitness investigation is needed 
the dot also chastised the unions representing eastern pilots and 
machinists for bringing the petition it accused the unions of 
engaging in a transparent attempt to put pressure on management 
by raising false safety concerns 
based on our earlier preliminary investigation of eastern and 
our review of publicly available current information we believe 
that eastern remains fit to operate said the department 
there was no immediate comment from the unions 
eastern spokesman robin matell said in miami that the dot 
decision was recognition that the pilots claims are absolute 
nonsense and reaffirms what was decided conclusively months 
ago in another federal investigation of eastern and its parent 
company texas air corp 
the dot earlier this year conducted an indepth look at the 
fitness of texas air corp including an examination of various 
financial transactions involving eastern that had been put into 
question by the unions last june the department said it found texas 
air corp to be fit to operate although it raised concerns about 
the ongoing labor disputes at eastern 
on wednesday the department in a sharply worded order denying 
the unions petition said the only cause for concern with respect 
to safety issues has been created by the irresponsible conduct of 
the pilot and machinist unions in withdrawing from a joint 
labormanagement safety committee that the two sides had established 
last july 
after eastern announced in october that it planned to sell its 
northeast shuttle operation to billionaire donald trump for 365 
million easterns unions withdrew from the safety committees the 
department said 
on dec 7 the air line pilots association which represents 
eastern pilots filed its petition requesting that the department 
reopen its investigation of easterns fitness because of the 
proposed sale of the shuttle the only profitable part of the 
airline 
the pilots union later was joined by the machinists union in 
making the request 
the petition argued that the proposed sale of the eastern shuttle 
to trump amounts to downsizing eastern and undermining the 
airlines financial condition to the point that it may not 
survive

the trial of a roman catholic priests claim 
that catholic university violated his academic freedom will provide 
an unusual look at the churchs inner workings 
the suit was brought by the rev charles e curran after the 
university revoked his right to teach theology on grounds that his 
writings were at odds with the faith 
the suit pits currans claims of academic freedom against the 
churchs contention it has the power to discipline clergy who stray 
from the orthodox teachings of the faith 
cardinal james a hickey archbishop of washington and chancellor 
of the university was the first witness as the trial got under way 
wednesday in superior court 
cardinal joseph bernardin archbishop of chicago who chaired the 
universitys board of trustees when action was first taken against 
curran is also set to testify 
hickey defended the universitys decision to revoke currans 
canonical mission to teach roman catholic theology after vatican 
authorities determined his writings were at odds with the faith 
curran 54 refused an offer to teach ethics outside the 
universitys religious department 
the university contends that it was merely enforcing the highest 
authority of the vatican which had revoked currans right to teach 
roman catholic theology 
as an ordained priest the university contends curran has an 
obligation to obey the revocation of his mission to teach catholic 
theology 
curran contends he was never conferred such authority and his 
contract to teach was no different than any other university 
professor with tenure 
hickey defended the decision to discipline curran saying the 
case of father curran had become a widely known matter it has 
caused in my opinion a great deal of harm to the church 
the church has the power to declare that a theologian no longer 
speaks for the faith when it believes a theologian has seriously 
departed from the catholic teaching hickey said 
an investigation of currans writings which among other things 
disputed the churchs stance on birth control and homosexuality 
determined he was unfaithful to the role as professor of 
theology hickey said 
because of the cases notoriety it was important that he be 
removed from the theology particularly because of the universitys 
unique relationship both with the holy see and the catholic church 
in this country hickey said 
founded in 1885 by pope leo xiii catholic university functions 
as one of few pontifical universities in the country that is 
governed directly by the church 
the action was taken because it seemed inconceivable to the 
board of trustees of the university that we could simply join in 
defiance on the part of father curran hickey testified 
currans attorney paul saunders said the decision to remove 
curran from the ecclesiastical faculty violated academic freedoms 
specifically conferred on the faculty following a strike over the 
issue in 1967 
moreover saunders said currans dissenting views summarized in 
his work faithful dissent were well known to the church long 
before his dismissal earlier this year 
the actions that have been taken against him are not because of 
some brandnew heretical position saunders said 
if the notion of academic freedom in the specific context of 
the present case means anything it means the university guaranteed 
a freedom in the face of public dissent from certain church 
teachings saunders said in pretrial arguments 
but kevin t baine who represents the university said the court 
had no right to question the churchs application of canon law 
which governed the relationship between curran and the university 
father curran thinks he hasnt an obligation to his church to 
abide by this declaration bain said 
curran was trying to change the university into something that he 
wants it to be baine argued 
judge frederick h weisberg agreed that the court has no power to 
secondguess application of church law but ruled that the issue in 
the case is whether these canons formed the basis of currans 
contract 
hickey said that curran was implicitly conferred a canonical 
mission when he was hired 
following his suspension from catholic university in 1987 curran 
was a visiting professor at cornell he currently has a oneyear 
appointment at the university of southern california

yes virginia there really is a santa 
claus a judge decided after hearing from a jolly old man who 
bellowed the familiar ho ho ho 
in a grave tone municipal judge george t choppelas said he was 
drawing partly on legal precedent set in the movie miracle on 
34th street in which a new york court found for the defendant 
santa claus 
as long as there is love and generosity and giftgiving this 
court is going to find that there really really is a santa claus 
choppelas said wednesday in the citys court of historical review 
and appeals a justforfun tradition with a real judge and lawyers 
choppelas made his ruling after a rollicking 90minute trial 
to consider the question 
after rounds of argument the event came to a standstill with the 
appearance of a large man in a red suit and white beard who laughed 
a hearty ho ho ho as he entered the courtroom toting a sack 
with toys and a golf club 
anticlaus lawyer frank winston attacked him but got nowhere 
an irate claus reminded winston that i got a letter from you 
when you were 6 years old testimony from 5yearold dave wharton 
helped the santa cause despite browbeating by winston who escorted 
the child off the stand 
shame on you admonished the judge before he made his ruling

it was 44 years ago but to those who were 
there the horrible but largely unknown atrocity at palawan in the 
philippines remains a vivid memory 
today we speak for those who endured the unendurable said 
dan crowley 67 of simsbury conn who organized a memorial 
service wednesday in honor of 140 american prisoners of war 
massacred by japanese forces on dec 14 1944 its a cleansing 
process that these men possibly will be remembered by their fellow 
americans 
glenn mcdole 67 a deputy sheriff in polk county iowa was one 
of 11 men to escape the palawan massacre during which japanese 
troops lured the americans into air raid holes doused them with 
gasoline and burned them to death 
mcdole was among the first of the pows to arrive at the 
slivershaped island in the philippines japanese forces used the 
prisoners to carve an air strip out of the jungle 
prisoners were beaten daily captured escapees were beheaded 
tiny rations of rice left them emaciated many weighing less than 
100 pounds their beards grew down to their exposed ribs 
i remember every bit of it said mcdole who underwent an 
appendectomy without any anesthesia during his captivity 
the morning of the 14th mcdole remembers overhearing japanese 
soldiers talking he said the japanese believed an american convoy 
was headed toward palawan after two years of hell the pows spirits 
were finally lifted 
get to your air raid trenches the americans are coming 
mcdole recalled his captors ordering without a doubt we thought 
we were going to be liberated he said 
the air raid siren was sounded the men crammed into the trenches 
the next thing mcdole recalled seeing was a platoon of japanese 
troops entering the camp compound some carrying buckets others 
torches 
i couldnt believe what was going to happen they threw 
gasoline in the trenches then the torches came in and it was just 
an explosion he said 
my god theyre killing everybody the prisoners shouted as 
mcdole watched some of his comrades knowing they were about to die 
run out of the trenches and grab on to japanese soldiers to take 
them to death 
some of the americans had dug a tunnel thinking they could 
escape if us troops bombed the island 
mcdole and about a handful of others made it out of the trenches 
rolled down a 60foot bank and tried to run to the channel to swim 
away many were shot down mcdole pinned down by machine gun fire 
crawled under a garbage pile and stayed there through the night 
the next day he made it to a nearby cave and stayed there until 
nightfall when he swam five miles to another island the next day 
trying to swim across an inlet he became entangled in a fish trap 
eventually saved by a passing boat 
crowley mcdole and others lament the fact that the massacre of 
palawan is known by few americans but they said the simple memorial 
service will help heal the wounds of the living and remember the 
victims 
we didnt come here with hatred in our hearts crowley told 
about 40 people who attended the service in the shadow of the 
washington monument we want to remember those who paid the 
ultimate price

friends say clayton yeutter the designated 
agriculture secretary in the bush administration is an able and 
tough negotiator adversaries put the emphasis on tough but 
acknowledge his ability to strike a bargain 
yeutter has been the nations no 1 negotiator on agricultural 
and other international trade issues for the past 3 years he is 
widely respected at home and abroad for his aggressive push to make 
foreign markets more open to us products and for his ability to 
soften harsh protectionist legislation in congress 
a man who needs very little sleep runs on a treadmill three 
times a week and always appears affable and reasonable yeutter has 
been an effective ambassador for us producers and manufacturers 
cajoling and threatening he managed to talk the japanese into 
opening their market to american beef exporters and he persuaded 
the europeans to import more us citrus fruits he also spearheaded 
a us drive to stop japan from dumping semiconductors or selling 
them abroad at prices below the cost of production 
in naming him to his new post bush said yeutter is so widely 
respected that he would have a running start on plans to open 
foreign markets even further to us farm produce 
yeutter will have a chance to see through a contentious fight 
with the european economic community over us demands for the 
elimination of agricultural subsidies the next meeting on that is 
scheduled for april in geneva 
his main opponent in that fight chief eec negotiator willy de 
clercq is also a fan he is very good very skillful also very 
stubborn de clercq said last week as he confronted yeutter at 
international trade talks in montreal 
another participant at that meeting sen bob packwood rore 
had profuse praise for the 58yearold yeutter hes dynamite 
was the evaluation of the ranking minority member of the finance 
committee hes the guy you want to have backtoback with you in 
a knife fight 
yeutter was considered for the top agriculture department job in 
1980 by presidentelect reagan but was passed over because of 
objections from some members of congress 
in the nixon and ford administrations he served as assistant 
secretary of agriculture running regulatory programs such as meat 
inspection and animal health and overseeing a dramatic increase in 
farm exports 
the push for further increasing farm exports has been paramount 
on his agenda as trade representative critics say he focused on 
this to the detriment of other important trade issues 
his main emphasis has been on attempts to get an international 
commitment to eliminate farm subsidies which the us government 
contends distort world trade and work to the detriment of american 
farmers and exporters of farm products 
agriculture is too important to nibble at the edges of 
reform he repeatedly argued during the montreal trade meeting 
earlier this month it must be changed radically 
yeutter agreed to take the top agriculture post despite an often 
stated desire to return to the private sector in his last private 
sector job he headed the chicago mercantile exchange the worlds 
second largest futures market 
yeutter who has four children grew up on a nebraska farm and 
still manages a 2500 property in the town of cozad

a survey on home equity loans found most 
borrowers aware they could face foreclosure if the money isnt 
repaid but a consumer group said many people still dont know what 
theyre getting into when they borrow against their homes 
the survey research center at the university of michigan reported 
wednesday that 58 percent of homeowners had a first mortgage and 11 
percent had other loans secured by their equity or the value of the 
home beyond what is owed on it 
the julynovember survey of 2510 households found that 
traditional second mortgages loans for a fixed amount to be repaid 
on a fixed schedule were held by 5 percent of the homeowners the 
newer home equity lines of credit which allow people to borrow 
money at their discretion up to an approved credit limit were held 
by 6 percent 
eightyfour percent of the homeowners with loans secured by their 
equity listed foreclosure as a risk should they be unable to repay 
the money and another 6 percent to 7 percent mentioned other legal 
actions as a possibility said richard t curtin director of the 
universitys surveys of consumers 
their caution in using their home equity line of credit 
comes out of this understanding of the consequences of missing 
payments he said 
among families with approved lines of credit 31 percent had not 
borrowed any money either because the planned need for the money 
had not arisen or because the credit line was meant to serve as a 
cash reserve in case of emergency according to the survey 
among those who had borrowed against their lines of credit the 
median outstanding debt was just 10 percent of net home equity 
although the median amount the families had authorization to borrow 
was 32 percent of net equity 
theyre well aware that theyre betting their home and theyre 
very cautious about it curtin said 
some consumer groups have criticized banks for advertising low 
rates on home equity loans that are available only for a short 
period and for failing to disclose important information about 
conditions and fees on the loans 
michelle meier of the private consumers union said the 
suggestion that consumers generally know the risks they are assuming 
is not justified by the surveys findings 
we think there are a lot of problems she said even 
consumers who are aware of the risk of foreclosure may be surprised 
by changing repayment plans rising interest rates and other 
conditions that could make it more difficult to repay their loans 
she said 
the university of michigan survey was supported by 35 
corporations financial institutions and trade associations with an 
interest in home equity loans curtin discussed the results at a 
news conference sponsored by the american financial services 
association and the us league of savings institutions two of the 
groups that helped finance the survey

the us decision to start a dialogue with 
yasser arafats plo could increase political divisions in israel at 
a time when sensitive talks are under way to form a new government 
it could also put israel on a collision course with its main 
benefactor for the first time since the lebanon war in 1982 
initial reactions indicated both major political parties prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc and foreign minister shimon 
peres labor party opposed the us move and would stand together 
in rejecting the palestine liberation organization as a partner for 
negotiations 
but if the usplo talks go well it will put pressure on israel 
to join the process this could deepen the laborlikud split on the 
peace issue and thwart talks on a powersharing coalition 
shamir has said arafats new moderation was a mirage and 
israel would never accept the plo as a negotiating partner he has 
argued the plos true aim remains the destruction of israel 
moshe arens a candidate for foreign minister in the next 
government and a close ally of shamir said the only possibility for 
a change in israels view was if the plo made good on its pledge to 
abstain from terror 
lets say that if a year or two goes by and there are no acts 
of terrorism maybe some people in israel will look at him in a 
different light arens said on the nbctv today show 
peres criticized the plo for failing to renounce the violence 
associated with the palestinian uprising such as throwing firebombs 
at israeli vehicles but he praised arafat for having learned to 
say peace the yearloing uprising has claimed the lives of at 
least 323 palestinians and 13 israelis 
peres favors an international peace conference proposed by the 
arabs and is willing to trade some occupied land for a peace 
agreement 
both ideas are vehemently opposed by shamir who says a 
unsponsored forum would be biased against israel and that israel 
would become weak and vulnerable if it gave up the west bank and 
gaza strip home to about 17 million palestinians and 70000 jewish 
settlers 
peres is under pressure from dovish labor members and liberals 
allied with the party to encourage the peace process even with the 
plo if he does so he will come into conflict with shamir and the 
possibility of another coalition government may evaporate 
if the government stands by its position opposing talks with 
the plo i believe the palestinian uprising and the prospects for 
war will both grow warned ran cohen a parliament member of the 
liberal citizens rights movement which was allied with labor in the 
nov 1 parliament elections 
we are at a crossroads between war and peace the government 
must decide now said cohen 
yossi beilin a leading labor party dove and former peres aide 
said it was too early to say if the us move would have an 
impact on coalition talks that had appeared to be making headway 
after six weeks of onagain offagain negotiations likud won 40 
seats and labor 39 in 120member parliament 
shamir who has until dec 26 to present a new government to 
president chaim herzog has said he could form a government without 
labor it would be made up of small religious and rightwing 
factions that favor annexation of the occupied territories and more 
jewish settlements 
but such a government would be weak and isolated internationally 
especially if the new us administration exerts pressure on israel 
to join the dialogue 
the united states has been israels main military economic and 
political supporter israel receives 3 billion a year in us aid 
more than any other country and the us veto in the un security 
council has staved off economic sanctions and other antiisraeli 
measures 
us administrations have rarely brought pressure on israel but 
in 1982 president reagan temporarily halted delivery of f16 fighter 
planes during israels 1982 invasion of lebanon which the us 
opposed 
the united states also held out the possibility of increased aid 
as an inducement to israel and egypt during peace negotiations that 
resulted in israels only peace treaty with an arab state in 1979 
to withstand such pressure likud parliament member benny begin 
the son of former prime minister menachem begin said labor and 
likud should present a united front 
this development highlights the necessity of establishing a 
national unity government that would withstand this very grave 
threat he said

president reagans decision to open direct 
talks with the palestine liberation organization capped a month of 
intense debate over recent plo overtures a period in which the 
united states stood virtually alone in the court of world opinion 
the historic decision announced wednesday came 18 days after 
secretary of state george p shultz refused to allow plo chairman 
yasser arafat to enter the united states to address the un general 
assembly shultz said arafat was kept out because his organization 
engaged in terrorism against americans and others 
shultz made clear wednesday that he was not forgiving the plo for 
its past but said arafats statements earlier in the day recognizing 
the existence of israel and renouncing terrorism had met standards 
set in 1975 for us dialogue with the plo 
many nations attacked shultzs nov 26 decision not to allow 
arafat to come to new york shultz made the decision just 11 days 
after the palestine national council the plos governing body had 
accepted un resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for peace talks 
and world leaders were eager for arafat to elaborate 
the criticism of shultz came from all quarters and included 
assertions the united states was violating the agreement under which 
new york serves as the organizations headquarters even pope john 
paul ii without specifically referring to the decision said 
every obstacle to the peace process should be removed 
un delegates passed a resolution denouncing the decision and 
only the united states and israel voted against it britain 
abstained president reagan and presidentelect bush stood by shultz 
the un then took the unprecedented step of moving its debate to 
geneva where on tuesday arafat made his longawaited speech and 
declared come let us make peace he recognized israels right 
to exist condemned terrorism and said peace negotiations should be 
based on resolutions 242 and 338 the three us conditions for 
opening a dialogue with the plo 
shultz had received advance word arafat might meet the standards 
and had according to sources informed israel that he was prepared 
to announce that the united states was ready to talk to the plo 
but after a close examination of the speech the state 
department said arafats language was ambiguous and did not meet 
our conditions 
arafat then called a wednesday news conference in geneva and 
carefully choosing his words as advisers whispered to him read a 
statement that called for a palestinian state to coexist alongside 
israel said resolutions 242 and 338 should serve as the framework 
for peace talks and that we totally and absolutely renounce all 
forms of terrorism including individual terrorism group and state 
terrorism 
at virtually the same time arafat spoke bush was applauding the 
plo leaders tuesday speech but repeating the standard reagan 
administration line that it had not gone far enough 
i want it clear i want it unambiguous i want is so nobody can 
argue with whats been said said the presidentelect apparently 
unaware of the clearer statements just made by arafat 
but at the white house and the state department where again 
advance word had been received that arafat was ready to meet the 
us conditions the day was spent determining whether he had 
at 930 am reagan was briefed by lt gen colin powell his 
national security adviser and told arafat planned a news conference 
at which he might use the right language 
four hours later reagan met with shultz powell and white house 
chief of staff kenneth duberstein and reaffirmed that he was ready 
to authorize dialogue provided arafat met the conditions according 
to white house aides 
at 4 pm shultz and powell spoke again shultz had a copy of 
arafats statement and indicated arafat had met the conditions 
less than a halfhour passed when powell briefed bush and gave 
him a copy of arafats statement 
at 512 pm according to the white house powell and duberstein 
called reagan and told him they believed arafat had met the 
conditions reagan immediately authorized the dialogue the 
administration notified israel and others of the decision 
even before shultz made the formal announcement israel issued a 
statement saying it regretted the move 
shultz made it official just after 630 pm 
i didnt change my mind he said in response to the 
inevitable question they made their statements clear

chefs at an orphanage are cooking up visions 
of dancing sugarplums after learning they will get two tons of sugar 
seized in a federal moonshine raid 
well go through this sugar rather quickly said bobby cobbs 
of virginia baptist childrens home and family services adding that 
orphanage workers planned to pick up the 4400 pounds of dixie 
crystal sugar today 
weve been doing a lot of dreaming figuring out what we can do 
with it 
the sugar along with moonshining apparatus that included 576 
plastic onegallon jugs was seized in september when agents broke 
up an alleged franklin county moonshine operation 
assistant us attorney karen peters filed a motion in federal 
court monday asking that the government give the sugar to the 
orphanage in salem 
judge james c turk agreed in an order filed wednesday the order 
also allows the government to use the sugar as evidence when 
defendants william gray stanley ricky lee dent and michael keith 
crook stand trial jan 18 on charges they ran a still and possessed 
mash and untaxed liquor 
the sugar would have gone to waste had it been stored as the case 
worked its way through the courts said jim silvey a bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms agent 
what weve done in the past is dispose of it in the federal 
penitentiaries but the closest one is in west virginia silvey 
said we figured if the moonshine was in virginia we could use it 
here 
moonshining has been a problem in franklin county for years and 
federal and state agents hoped that by monitoring large sugar sales 
they would be able to take a larger dent out of the illegal industry 
cobbs said the orphanage which receives funds from baptist 
churches other private sources and the government has 72 children 
about 10 or 20 of the children ranging from ages 5 to 18 will stay 
at the center during the christmas holidays while others visit 
relatives once school is out 
orphanage chefs will use the sugar to make extra holiday sweets 
for the kids with plenty of sugar left over for daytoday use 
cobbs said the sugar is valued at about 1500 and will bolster to 
the orphanages annual food budget of 106000 he said

many police once thought all the motivation people 
needed to report crime was a sense of civic duty and a few words 
from officer mcgruff the cartoon bloodhound who barked take a 
bite out of crime 
not anymore police are increasingly turning to cash rewards and 
morbid crime reenactments on television to lure john q public to 
the phone 
the policesponsored crime stoppers genre most familiar as 
60second spots on local tv took a giant leap toward hollywood last 
week with broadcasts of manhunt a chance to end the nightmare 
with help from an independent film company seattle police 
investigators created two hours of televised murder mayhem and 
mystery in a plea for clues to the countrys worst unsolved serial 
murder case the green river slayings of at least 40 women in 
the northwest 
the syndicated program distributed to 137 stations nationwide 
included a reenacted murder attempt real footage of police 
unearthing a victim and interviews with grieving relatives viewers 
were urged to turn in a crook and maybe collect a 100000 reward 
the show was designed to push an emotional button in the 
viewer said producer beth broday 
it apparently did the program broadcast dec 7 and repeated 
during the past week drew more than 7600 calls to a tollfree 
hotline 
investigators rejoiced at the flood of fresh tips and praised the 
marriage of sleuthing and the media 
its the most effective tool in law enforcement declared 
detective myrle l carner director of seattles crime stoppers 
program 
the popularity of such programs reflects a get tough on crime 
revival said art lurigio assistant professor of psychology at 
northwestern university and coauthor of a 1986 study on the 
programs for the us justice department 
people are looking to have some impact on crime alleviate 
their fears and regain some control said lurigio although he 
cautioned there may be some negative consequences 
offering large cash rewards and anonymity may encourage false 
accusations and the nightly reenactments could unnecessarily 
increase fear of crime lurigio said 
crime stoppers began 12 years ago in albuquerque nm when 
police and civic leaders decided they needed a new weapon to fight 
increasing crime the premise grab attention with a televised 
crime of the week reenactment then promise cash rewards and 
anonymity to anyone reporting any serious crime 
the concept took off more than 600 us communities now have 
crime stoppers programs said tim kline a retired albuquerque 
police officer and president of crime stoppers international which 
helps set up local programs 
crime stoppers tips have helped solve more than 210000 felonies 
and led to the recovery of 13 billion in narcotics and stolen 
property kline said 
in the last two tv seasons networks and syndicates have created 
dramatic variations on the crime stoppers theme not only are the 
programs popular with viewers they also are successful of 115 
fugitives portrayed on fox broadcasting cos americas most 
wanted 55 are in jail fox says nbc says its unsolved 
mysteries has broadcast 50 stories and helped solve 11 cases 
on wednesday authorities in nevada arrested a man suspected of 
bilking investors of up to 35 million after they were tipped off 
by a maid who found a note in his motel room saying the unsolved 
mysteries program was a bombshell the show had featured his case 
nov 30 
the police behind last weeks manhunt program hope the 
success rubs off on the maddening green river case 
more than 15 million has been spent hunting for the killer 
whose first victims were dragged from the green river south of 
seattle in 1982 the murderer now is officially blamed for the 
deaths of 40 women most linked to prostitution and street life 
the killings stopped in 1984 but investigators say the murderer 
may have moved on theyre studying whether he might be responsible 
for at least some of the slayings of more than 30 transients and 
prostitutes since 1985 in san diego and the discovery of six female 
bodies near new bedford mass since july some of them believed to 
have been prostitutes prompted police speculation that the killer 
had crossed the country 
during manhunt viewers were urged to report clues not only 
to the green river case but to any serious crime in the country 
calls came in from every state at least two people said they 
were the green river killer several others said the killer had 
confessed to them 
some calls were pranks and many offered information too dated or 
general to be helpful investigators said it will take weeks to sort 
through the 3000 tips that seem initiallly promising 
one tip already has produced results albeit unrelated to the 
green river case police said two murder suspects were arrested 
saturday in seattle and taken to jail 
surprisingly thats where many tipsters are too 
we get a lot of calls from jails said carner the old 
saying that theres no honor among thieves is true they love to rat 
on each other

colorcoded registration stickers soon will 
determine which day of the week private vehicles will be allowed to 
circulate in this smogplagued metropolis 
the plan to issue stickers in five different colors was one of 
several anticontamination measures announced late wednesday by the 
federal government 
officials also said holiday school vacations that began wednesday 
would be extended until february in the city in a bid to cut down 
childrens exposure to healththreatening winter smog 
in addition to the restrictions on private vehicles mexico city 
also will try to battle its critical air pollution problem by 
increasing vehicle inspections prohibiting the burning of tires 
plastics and other contaminating wastes in open areas and setting 
hours for cargo loading and unloading in the city during the smog 
season 
the announcement did not mention sanctions against violators of 
the new regulations generally enforcement of most regulations in 
mexico is lax 
it said that from jan 9 to march 21 vehicles observed to be 
contaminating the air will be taken out of circulation 
beginning jan 16 smog checks will be obligatory for cargo 
vehicles whether they have gas or diesel engines the antiburning 
regulation will be in effect from dec 15 to march 21

he said schoolchildren would make up the lost month of classes 
next summer there are about 23 million students in mexico city 
public schools according to federal government statistics 
we have agreed to protect the children of mexico city and part 
of that is to change the school hours manjarrez said we all 
know that the thermal inversion layer levels will be worse during 
the winter and that we have to take measures 
last winter authorities delayed the start of public school 
classes by two hours to limit exposure children often found 
themselves outdoors on the street in the early morning waiting for 
buses while traffic was at its worst and smog at its strongest 
homer aridjis president of the group of 100 a leading 
environmental organization said the schedule change would do little 
to restrict smog exposure schoolage children breathe foul mexico 
city air whether theyre at school or at home he said 
the solution is not to change the school calendar aridjis 
said it is not going to change the pollution situation more 
drastic measures such as less traffic are necessary 
mexico citys smog regularly worsens during winter when a layer 
of warm air traps cold air bearing tons of pollutants near ground 
level the phenomenon is known as a thermal inversion the condition 
can last for hours sometimes days 
the mountains that ring the valley of mexico where mexico city 
lies prevent the dispersal of smog by winds rains are scarce in 
winter permitting winds to lift tons of dust bearing particle 
pollution and dried fecal matter off the dry lake texcoco lakebed 
about 18 million people live in the mexico city metropolitan area

yasser arafat has come a long way from a 
guerrilla commando force leader to a statesman 
he is the symbol of palestinians desire for a homeland never 
wavering in his dream of creating a palestinian state 
for nearly three decades the 59yearold arafat has been both 
revolutionary chieftain and politician ricocheting between touching 
the dream and losing control of the movement to rivals backed by 
other arab governments 
each setback of the plo chased from jordan in 1970 and from 
lebanon in 1982 was trumpeted as the final demise of arafat each 
time he returned 
and this month he piloted the plo through making the concessions 
demanded by the united states before it would open a dialogue 
israel has denounced him for years as the archterrorist 
masterminding attempts to destroy the jewish state washington just 
last month denied him a visa to address the united nations citing 
his links to terrorism 
but the base of his success has been widespread support among the 
worlds 55 million palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip his pictures sprout among demonstrators in the yearold 
uprising against israels 21year occupation 
arafat seems consumed by his mission for a homeland he does not 
smoke or drink and is notorious for latenight meetings 
arafat without wife children or fixed address says he married 
the cause when he formed an underground palestinian movement fatah 
in october 1959 
his date and place of birth have never been confirmed though the 
plo does not dispute the version that he was born aug 29 1929 in 
jerusalems old city 
born mohammed abed arouf arafat his father came from a 
prosperous merchant clan on his mothers side he can trace his 
ancestry back to fatima daughter of the moslem prophet mohammed 
arafat says he smuggled arms to arab forces during the 1948 
arabisraeli war then went to egypt to enroll in cairo university 
in 1952 he was elected president of the palestinian student union 
in egypt 
arafat left egypt in 1957 after taking part in the suez war as a 
reserve officer in the egyptian army he worked in kuwait as a 
government engineer before forming his own successful contracting 
firm 
the plo was created in 1964 and arafat brought fatah above 
ground on jan 1 1965 with its first military commando operation 
against israel 
arafat led commando operations against israel before the 1967 
arabisraeli war later he traveled clandestinely through the west 
bank to organize fatah military units he was elected plo chairman 
in 1969 
in 1970 he faced his first serious challenge from an arab 
government jordans king hussein threatened by the growing power 
of the palestinians within his kingdom moved his army against them 
arafat escaped one of two acknowledged assassination attempts 
that year the second came in october 1971 on an inspection tour in 
syria he says he never sleeps in the same place for two nights 
running 
in 1974 the united nations granted the plo observer status an 
enduring image of arafat is when he addressed the general assembly 
offering an olive branch of peace but wearing an empty holster 
in the late 1970s his guerrillas became embroiled in lebanons 
civil war their strength in southern lebanon led israel to invade 
in 1982 palestinian guerrillas were scattered from tunisia to syria 
after world governments intervened to lift an israeli siege of the 
plo in beirut 
guerrilla leaders disgusted with arafats loyalty to commanders 
who did not stand and fight the israelis got syrian backing to try 
to unseat him arafat was expelled from damascus in june 1983 
proarafat forces were evacuated from tripoli lebanon that 
december 
but arafat moved plo headquarters to tunis and gradually rebuilt 
a consensus among palestinian groups that consensus glued 
together with the uprising in the occupied territories led to this 
months announced change in the palestinian position and the 
projected dialogue with the united states 
arafat and the plo made a political drive in the last month to 
convince the world they are peaceful moderate and worthy of 
representing palestinians in the middle east peace process

a postal employee pulled a shotgun out at the 
main post office wednesday night wounded three people and holed up 
in the building with at least one hostage authorities said 
the gunman eluded police for about five hours before agents found 
him in a room used for coffe breaks during a roomtoroom search of 
the blockwide building said fbi spokesman volney hayes 
the gunman who hayes said was holding at least one hostage 
fired two shots at agents who then backed off 
he was barricaded behind a door as the agents approached he 
fired said cesta ayers a post office spokesman 
negotiations with the gunman were being conducted by telephone 
ayers said early thursday 
earlier hayes said the gunman got into an argument with a 
coworker and pulled a weapon out of a bag 
authorities identified the gunman as warren murphy about 40 a 
sixyear postal worker one of the people shot was the person murphy 
argued with hayes said he did not identify the victim or elaborate 
i was going to mail this box of stuff i have and the security 
guard came down he was real excited said a witness pat 
wingerter of new orleans the guard was screaming theres a guy 
with a gun 
four hours after the incident began at 830 pm authorities 
said an undetermined number of postal employees were apparently 
still inside the building but it was not known if they were being 
held hostage 
about midnight a dozen postal employees who had been laying low 
on the vast second floor escaped through a back door hayes said 
leaving about 20 to 30 or the 500 workers on the night shift 
unaccounted for 
we still think hes in there he said some postal 
inspectors have evacuated they werent really hostages 
hayes said the workers who escaped had seen murphy but hadnt had 
any contact with him the employees were hustled away by fbi after 
they came out of the building 
ayers said murphy may have had marital problems the 
information we have at this time is that his wife did leave him 
and left the city we have not talked to him but that is the rumor 
we have at this time ayers said 
two patients were at tulane medical center where they were in 
stable condition a tulane spokesman said one person was hit in the 
thigh and one in the arm a third person was wounded in the eye and 
was undergoing surgery late wednesday at charity hospital a 
hospital spokeswoman said 
i dont think anybody is hurt real bad at the present time 
said dr norman mcswain police surgeon i know nobody has any 
lifethreatening injuries 
ayers said unidentified relatives were at the scene to assist 
with negotiations there was no word if murphy was demanding 
anything said hayes whose agency was in charge of the situation 
because the post office is federal property 
jerry vale a postal worker who was working on the ground floor 
said i just saw some people come running from upstairs saying 
there was a man loose with a shotgun 
a security guard told police that the gunman might be hiding on 
the second floor where lettersorting machines and other large 
equipment is located 
theres plenty of places to hide up there vale said 
special police teams dressed in flak jackets surrounded the post 
office on loyola avenue on the edge of the central business district 
wingerter said the security guard ran to the door to make sure 
the half dozen or so postal workers and customers in the immediate 
area escaped out the front safely 
i heard one shot and then the people started coming out he 
said even after the shot there were people driving up mailing 
letters for about five minutes it was crazy 
adding to the confusion holiday shoppers poured out the adjacent 
macys department store to see what was going on 
on aug 20 1986 parttime mailman patrick henry sherrill walked 
into the post office in edmond okla with guns and ammunition 
hidden in his mail bag and began shooting 
he fatally wounded 14 postal workers and injured six others 
before killing himself police thinking sherrill was holding 
workers hostage waited outside for an hour before entering the 
building to aid the wounded and to free employees who had hidden 
from the gunman witnesses said the final shots were heard about 40 
minutes before police entered the building

major us jewish groups warily supported the reagan 
administrations historic decision to sit down with the palestine 
liberation organization while arabamericans said the policy 
reversal rekindled hope for middle east peace 
several american jewish leaders said they trusted president 
reagan and secretary of state george p shultz in their decision to 
open a substantive dialogue with the plo but called on plo 
chairman yasser arafat to back his words of peace with action 
we understand that the united states having set standards for 
speaking with the plo and the plo having met those minimum 
standards that it is appropriate for us to live up to its 
commitment said abraham h foxman national director of the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith in new york 
it is a first step now we must watch to see if the plo will 
match words with deeds 
james zogby executive director of the arabamerican institute in 
washington called the governments decision to end its longtime 
rejection of the plo as a party to middle east peace efforts an 
important step forward 
the dialogue should throw into sharp relief the failure of 
israel to say yes to the very issues that the plo has now acceded 
to zogby said our hope is that the dialogue is productive and 
that peace is now possible 
in washington legislators from both parties cautiously endorsed 
the move 
it may be a blind alley but an alley worth treading with eyes 
open said sen richard lugar rind this dialogue in no way 
mitigates our steadfast support of israel but i hope israel will at 
least be willing to informally acknowledge this process as a worthy 
attempt 
in the interest of peace and security for israel and all 
parties in the region the us has no sensible choice but to begin 
a dialogue said us rep david obey dwis chairman of the 
house foreign operations appropriations subcommittee 
but he added the proof will still lie in deeds and not 
words 
atlanta mayor andrew young who nearly a decade ago was forced by 
thenpresident carter to resign as the us ambassador to the united 
nations for meeting with a plo representative applauded the 
decision saying people were not ready for this before now 
reagan said wednesday he authorized the state department to enter 
into a substantive dialogue with the palestinian group after 
arafat said he was renouncing all forms of terrorism 
shultz who only two weeks ago barred arafat from entering the 
united states and called him an accessory to terrorism said the 
plo issued a statement in which it met all three us conditions for 
a dialogue the conditions were acceptance of un security council 
resolutions affirming the right of all states to live in peace 
recognition of israel and renunciation of terrorism 
while the israeli government swiftly criticized the move many 
us jewish groups were reluctant to do so reflecting the 
dissension that has marred relations between israel and many 
american jews over israels hardline policies on the west bank and 
gaza strip 
morris b abram chairman of the conference of presidents of 
major american jewish organizations in new york said in a 
statement we neither approve nor disapprove we accept it we 
trust the united states 
the first action the us should take in its conversations with 
the plo should be to demand that the plo repeal the palestine 
national covenant which calls for the destruction of the state of 
israel he said 
unless and until the plo translates its words into the deed of 
repealing that covenant there can be no progress toward peace in 
the middle east 
however the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles dedicated to 
the study of the holocaust and promoting israel in world affairs 
said it was disappointed with the decision 
while both president reagan and secretary of state george 
shultz have proven themselves to be the staunchest friends of the 
state of israel the road they have chosen to embark is fraught with 
danger said the statement read by a spokesman rabbi abraham 
cooper 
the response from arabamerican organizations while generally 
favorable was in some cases tinged with bitterness mt mehdi 
president of the american arab relations committee in new york said 
his organization was not impressed 
the state department should talk to israel and urge it not to 
shoot at the palestinian youth nor to use american airplanes to 
attack palestinian camps in lebanon he said

a snowstorm forced rescuers to leave two 
men stranded on a glacier in southeast alaska for a second day after 
their small plane made an emergency landing on the remote river of 
ice 
once visibility improved today coast guard officials planned to 
send a helicopter to pick up the men who messaged by radio that 
they were unhurt and wearing survival gear said coast guard lt 
rick ehret 
they gave every indication that theyre still in very good 
shape are nice and warm have plenty of food and can stand another 
night on the glacier ehret said wednesday 
the 1940svintage grumman widgeon amphibious plane landed about 
100 miles northwest of juneau on grand pacific glacier on tuesday 
afternoon ehret said the plane was not damaged and the men were 
waiting inside it 
the men contacted passing commercial and military jets by radio 
late tuesday and their distress calls were relayed to the coast 
guard in juneau ehret said 
pilot mike mills 38 and passenger charles buddy ferguson 
31 of gustavus were flying from cordova to gustavus when they were 
forced to land about 45 miles from their destination for an unknown 
reason ehret said 
mills wife connie said both men were professional pilots who 
had recently restored the plane 
the coast guard dispatched an h3 helicopter wednesday morning to 
rescue the men but the craft ran into a snowstorm and poor 
visibility forced it to land at gustavus 50 miles northwest of 
juneau 
later attempts by two helicopters to reach the glacier were also 
unsuccessful ehret said 
they were making good headway and then they got up to that 
cross sound area and the weather got real bad ehret said 
a coast guard c130 transport plane made several passes over the 
glacier to communicate with the men the last communication came 
late wednesday as the plane passed over the area on its way back to 
kodiak to refuel ehret said 
ehret said the cause of the two mens emergency landing probably 
was not due to the weather which was clear in the area tuesday

prosecutors sorry attempts to prove their 
divorcefixing conspiracy charges involving bess myerson would have 
gotten them hauled off the gong show said a lawyer for the 
former miss americas lover 
in a summation filled with sarcasm and punctuated by oneliners 
that drew laughter from the judge jurors and spectators attorney 
jay goldberg ridiculed the governments case wednesday calling many 
of its 34 witnesses biased disgruntled disturbed people 
never have so many days so much time energy and taxpayers 
money been spent on such trivial pursuits such diversionary issues 
while bringing to you so little truth to support the governments 
case goldberg told the jury 
the defense was expected to continue that tack today as closing 
arguments resumed in the us district court trial 
miss myerson miss america 1945 and once the citys cultural 
affairs commissioner is accused of trying to influence a judges 
rulings in her lovers divorce by giving a city job to the judges 
daughter 
miss myerson 64 her lover carl andy capasso 43 and 
former state supreme court justice hortense gabel 75 who made 
interim rulings in capassos bitter divorce are charged with 
conspiracy fraud and briberelated charges 
mrs gabels lawyer michael feldberg said in his summation that 
the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 
any conspiracy existed there is no direct evidence of the secret 
agreement at the heart of this case he said 
the prosecution which summed up its case tuesday claims that 
mrs gabel cut capassos weekly payments to his estranged wife 
nancy by more than half in exchange for the 19000ayear city job 
miss myerson gave to the judges daughter sukhreet gabel 
feldberg who was to conclude his statement today and be followed 
by miss myersons lawyer said mrs gabel acted in the capasso 
case as a judge is supposed to act she crafted a decision which in 
her mind was fair and reasonable 
the defense maintains that capassos payments were cut because 
they were too high to begin with and that when child support 
mortgage payments and other expenses were added on the cut was 
minuscule 
leading off for the defense goldberg representing capasso 
ridiculed the governments case saying prosecution witnesses should 
have been hauled off stage in midstory like contestants on the 
gong show 
making faces pacing flailing his hands and jabbing his fingers 
in the air he described sukhreet gabel who testified for the 
prosecution as sick and disturbed and said the government put 
her up to taping her own parents 
theres got to be a level of decency below which even an 
advocate will not sink in a quest to make a case he said adding 
that prosecutors stooped so low that they scuffed their knuckles 
on the pavement 
ms gabel 39 admitted that she has undergone electroshock 
treatment for clinical depression and that she took documents from 
her mothers home to prosecutors and taped two phone conversations 
with her mother 
talking about the divorce that spawned the trial goldberg 
quipped that was a perfect case for judge wapner for peoples 
court 
goldberg scoffed at the credibility of capassos former 
britishborn housekeeper shirley harrod and likened her gossipy 
testimony to the public television series upstairs downstairs 
about a wealthy british family and its servants 
how important was it that you learn bess myerson didnt want 
people to know she was sleeping this is the 80s now that she 
was sleeping with andy capasso goldberg asked rhetorically 
he maintained that capassos exwife had instigated the case 
because she was dissatisfied with the divorce settlement 
what a tragedy that were here because nancy capasso has sold 
the government a bill of goods that wont hold up said goldberg

government is best that governs least according to 
henry david thoreau but a state order for a full environmental 
review of a proposed project near his beloved walden pond may keep 
development of the area at bay 
we are walden ponds caretakers said john devillars the 
states newly named secretary of the environmental affairs agency 
which called for the lengthy review on wednesday 
our responsibility is to ensure that we take every reasonable 
measure to avoid or minimize damage to this historic area nothing 
short of a full review will fulfill that responsibility devillars 
said 
at issue is a proposed concord office park by the developer 
boston properties which wants to build a 148000squarefoot office 
building and a 518car parking area 
the land is near where thoreau worked on his masterpiece 
walden while living there in solitude beginning in 1845 for two 
years in a hut on land owned by ralph waldo emerson in the book 
thoreau writes about the importance being close to nature 
the land later was donated to middlesex county and eventually to 
the state which maintains the heavily used recreation area around 
the pond 
some preservation groups have urged the state to buy the land and 
add it to the walden state reservation surrounding the pristine 
historic site in concord but despite passage of a record 500 
million bond for land purchases state officials say they cannot 
afford to buy it 
edward linde president of boston properties said the states 
11thhour decision had no basis in law or logic 
the record proves that boston properties has complied fully 
with every applicable state and local environmental and zoning law 
and regulation linde said we will review the states request 
carefully 
the site proposed for the development was cleared 25 years ago 
and is now zoned for commercial development by concord whose 
officials are eager to add the development to the towns tax base 
in august boston properties voluntarily agreed to an initial 
evaluation of the project under the massachusetts environmental 
policy act mepa after the company filed a report the state 
decided to order a full mepa review an often lengthy and expensive 
process based on the developers information staff analysis and 
public comment 
the key issue cited by the state in ordering the review was 
concern over traffic surrounding the area 
walden pond is a 62acre body of water in a 333acre stateowned 
reservation on the edge of concord an affluent town of 12500 about 
20 miles northwest of boston

terrorism in all its forms including state terrorism an apparent 
reference to israeli actions in the occupied west bank and gaza

which called for ending terrorism outside israel and the occupied 
territories but not inside

occupation of the west bank and gaza strip he added the uprising

the us decision to talk to the plo is a 
major political triumph for yasser arafat that could breathe new 
life into the comatose middle east peace process or touch off a 
violent backlash by palestinian radicals 
there is also the possibility that factions outside the plo such 
as the one led by terrorist mastermind abu nidal may simply unleash 
a new wave of terror to wreck the plo chairmans diplomatic 
initiative 
if the breakthrough fails to produce solid political gains 
particularly us pressure on israel to negotiate it could trigger 
attacks by radicals within the plo who fear arafat has made too many 
concessions in the palestinians 40yearold struggle for a homeland 
the marxist popular front for liberation of palestine which 
reconciled with arafat last year after a fouryear split has 
already accused him of capitulation by renouncing terrorism and 
recognizing israels right to exist 
col saeed mousa who leads the syrianbased breakaway 
fatahuprising faction on wednesday branded arafat a traitor 
for his surrenderist concessions to the united states and the 
israeli enemy 
mousa known by his nom de guerre of abu mousa split from the 
plo in 1983 with other dissident factions in a syrianbacked mutiny 
launched to protest arafats moves toward moderation 
after fierce fighting arafat and his loyalists already forced 
out of beirut and south lebanon by israels 1982 invasion were 
driven out of their last lebanese stronghold 
capt ahmed jibril commander of the extremist syrianbacked 
popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command 
declared angrily in damascus wednesday night arafat has 
recognized and offered fourfifths of the palestinian land to 
israel 
the plo leadership has accepted that israel is there to stay and 
seeks a palestinian homeland only in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip abandoning the dream of regaining all of pre1948 palestine 
by renouncing violence and terrorism arafat is condemning 
anyone who uses the gun against the israeli occupier jibril said 
arafat has offered israel what he doesnt have the land of 
palestine is not the property of any organization or any 
individual 
west german authorities six weeks ago arrested 13 suspected 
pflpgc members who they said were planning terrorist attacks they 
also seized explosives 
arafat and his top lieutenants would be targets along with 
israelis and american if the radicals go on the warpath again 
for 15 years since he first showed signs of moderation arafat 
has had to battle not only the israelis but palestinian extremists 
and hardline arab states led by syria whose president hafez assad 
has long sought to wrestle control of the palestinian cause from 
arafat 
gunmen led by the renegade abu nidal wanted by a dozen 
countries have assassinated a score of key arafat aides over the 
years in a campaign to silence the moderates 
others have been killed by israels secret service mossad the 
israelis latest victim was arafats righthand man khalil 
alwazir who was slain in tunis on april 16 
the reagan administration agreed wednesday to open direct talks 
with arafat after he told a special un general assembly session in 
geneva that the plo renounces all forms of terrorism and said it 
explicitly recognizes israels right to exist 
that was an abrupt turnaround by washington which only the day 
before had said arafat had not gone far enough to meet us 
conditions for a dialogue 
last month arafat steered the palestine national council the 
plos parliamentinexile and highest decisionmaking body to 
implicitly recognize israels right to exist by accepting un 
security council resolutions 242 and 338 it also declared an 
independent palestinian state in the west bank and gaza where 
palestinians have been in revolt for a year 
radical plo factions disagreed with arafats moderate strategy 
which was primarily aimed at persuading the americans to deal 
directly with the plo and put pressure on israel to negotiate 
george habashs popular front for the liberation of palestine 
the prime mover behind the wave of airliner hijackings of the 1960s 
and 1970s and the marxist democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine nonethless reluctantly went along with the pnc declaration 
in the interest of unity 
but habash warned arafat last month were backing your efforts 
because this is what the majority wants but we dont believe 
moderation will pay 
we cant wait forever if you fail you have to come back to 
this council to say so and we can then decide the future course

medical schools have done a good job of recruiting 
women to their faculties but still rarely promote them to be deans 
department heads and tenured professors a study published today 
concludes 
the report found that even though their numbers have grown 
dramatically women still hold only a small share of the best jobs 
at medical schools a decade ago 8 percent of women faculty were 
full professors now 9 percent are by comparison 32 percent of men 
faculty are professors 
this means there are few women role models for young doctors 
indeed the report in the new england journal of medicine 
concludes there are few departments in any school in which a 
student can readily find a woman physician in a senior position who 
is happy with both her professional life and available to give the 
student pointers and support 
however just why women doctors dont make it to the top is still 
unclear 
we dont know if the women are choosing not to be on the tenure 
track or whether its a whole series of smaller decisions that are 
made for them because there isnt a flexible schedule for taking 
care of small children said janet bickel who directed the study 
and is head of womens programs at the association of american 
medical colleges in washington 
among the findings 
even though women make up 19 percent of medical school 
faculties they hold 7 percent of the full professorships 
during the past 10 years the number of women on medical school 
faculties has grown from 6249 to 10840 
two of the nations 127 medical schools are headed by women 
compared with none a decade ago the number of medical school 
departments led by women has increased from 56 to 70 
onethird of medical school students are female up from 
onequarter 10 years ago 
the work is a followup to a study coauthored seven years ago by 
dr marilyn heins of the university of arizona college of medicine 
the numbers look better heins said there are more women 
students and residents but in terms of women in top positions 
really nothing much has changed 
in an interview bickel said she doubts that women fail to reach 
the top in academic medicine because of frank discrimination 
something tells me people would have found their way to my 
telephone if there was outright discrimination based on gender 
she said i think we have gotten to the point in the faculty 
review process where people seriously try to be fair 
typically junior faculty members are given seven or eight years 
to earn tenure if they fail to get it they leave or take 
nontenure track jobs but they rarely are given a second chance to 
earn tenure which is a crucial step toward highlevel positions in 
medical schools 
whether or not young doctors get tenure rests largely on how many 
research papers they have published bickel said other studies have 
shown that women faculty members do less research than men 
bickel said its possible that a woman doctor with small children 
gives up her research interests because she is already working 60 
hours a week teaching and taking care of patients the research and 
publishing that are necessary to present oneself for tenure are 
lost 
she said medical schools could make tenure easier for women by 
providing more flexible schedules parenting leaves and 
opportunities to work toward tenure later in their careers

the aids drug azt can improve memory and attention 
and ease other mental problems that are frequent symptoms of aids a 
study published today shows 
hiv the aids virus attacks the brain as well as the bodys 
immune system mental lapses can be the first signs of the disease 
the latest study published in the new england journal of 
medicine confirms earlier reports showing that azt can relieve 
these mental symptoms at least in their first stages 
the drug also known as zidovudine and retrovir is the only 
medicine approved for aids treatment while it does not cure aids 
azt relieves victims physical symptoms and prolongs their lives 
the latest work directed by dr frederick a schmitt of the 
university of kentucky medical center was part of a larger study of 
the drugs overall safety and effectiveness 
of 262 patients who participated nearly half were found to have 
some neurologic impairment when the study started sixty of these 
people were randomly chosen to take azt while 69 got placebos 
two months after treatment started those who got azt scored 
significantly better on tests of attention memory motor skills and 
general mental speed 
people with fullblown aids improved more than those who had the 
preaids disease called aidsrelated complex or arc 
these data are also important because they show that the 
neurologic dysfunction caused by hiv infection may be reversible to 
some extent the researchers wrote

lengthy testing in rats and mice to predict 
whether a chemical poses a cancer hazard in humans usually fails to 
provide enough information to justify its cost researchers asserted 
today 
most chemicals should be classified instead on the basis of 
shortterm lab tests says a costbenefit analysis in the british 
journal nature 
concerns over rodent testing have been raised before centering 
on the uncertainty over how relevant they are for predicting how a 
chemical will affect people 
the researchers said 30 percent of chemicals tested for 
cancercausing potential in one program behaved differently in rats 
than in mice rodent tests are probably no more predictive for 
humans and could be much less since people are more biologically 
different from rodents than rats are from mice researchers said 
before deciding on whether to use a longterm rodent test 
regulators should consider results of shortterm testing and the 
costs to society of misclassifying a chemical researchers said for 
most chemicals proceeding to the rodent tests would not be worth 
the cost they said 
social costs of misclassifying a chemical include additional 
cancers if a dangerous chemical is wrongly labeled safe if a safe 
chemical is erroneously labeled cancercausing society loses access 
to a potentially valuable compound or pays for needless precautions 
the researchers are from carnegiemellon university in 
pittsburgh case western reserve university in cleveland and the 
university of washington in seattle

an unemployed truck driver is accused 
of raping two women in separate assaults along the same densely 
wooded stretch of highway where the bodies of six women have been 
discovered since july officials said 
neil anderson 35 of new bedford pleaded innocent wednesday to 
charges he abducted and raped a woman at knifepoint in august 1987 
he was held at the bristol county jail on 20000 bond 
afterward a second woman who identified anderson in a composite 
photograph accused him of raping her in july said bristol county 
district attorney ronald a pina 
the two rape cases have come out as a legitimate result of this 
investigation into the highway serial killings said pina 
although he declined to confirm news reports that anderson is a 
suspect in the slayings 
theres a good list of suspects we have theyre all being 
checked out pina said at a news conference wednesday i think 
we are definitely closing in the circle is becoming smaller and 
smaller 
the partially clad skeletons of six women have been found since 
july in a six to eightmile radius along interstate 195 and route 
140 in dartmouth and freetown 
thomas gibney a spokesman for pina declined to say whether 
anderson a divorced father of two who lives with his mother and 
grandmother had been among those questioned in the slayings 
pina has said he believes the six killings were likely the 
victims of the same killer or killers and that the victims all had 
ties to new bedfords weld square neighborhood known for 
prostitution and drugs 
douglas ubelaker a forensic pathologist with the smithsonian 
institution called in to examine the victims remains said all six 
women apparently died in a similar manner but he declined to detail 
his findings 
anderson who has also worked as a welder and lives about 10 
blocks from the weld square area was arrested at home tuesday he 
was charged with aggravated rape kidnapping and assault and 
battery with a dangerous weapon 
james m quinn the public defender representing anderson said 
his client has been charged with only one crime i think that to 
try to link that to any other events is very unfair 
gibney said an arraignment on the second rape charge would not be 
held unless anderson posted bail at that time we would slap the 
other warrant on him but barring that hes just going to sit there 
in jail until he goes before the grand jury on the other 
charges he said 
judge john a markey scheduled a pretrial hearing on dec 21 in 
new bedford district court anderson also will appear at that time 
on charges of assault and battery with a deadly weapon in an 
unrelated fight quinn said

amnesty international said today that torture cases 
in the philippines have increased as the government has escalated 
its fight against communist insurgents 
military intelligence agents are reported to have subjected 
detainees to severe beatings electric shocks stabbings near 
suffocation with plastic bags or water and sexual abuse said the 
report by the londonbased group 
similar abuses in police stations have been reported soldiers 
on patrol have been accused of rape and other abuses in villages 
suspected of sympathizing with rebel forces it said 
this pattern of torture has reemerged even though president 
corazon aquinos government enacted constitutional and legal 
measures to outlaw brutality amnesty international said in the 
report 
amnesty international believes that immediate action is still 
needed to enforce legal safeguards against incommunicado detention 
to investigate fully all allegations of torture and to bring those 
responsible to justice the report said 
in manila mrs aquino said today i am in touch with the 
progress of these cases the final reports are not yet in as not all 
witnesses have been heard she urged human rights organizations to 
submit reports of violations to a new committee she created this 
week to investigate alleged abuses 
last saturday mrs aquino acknowledged violations were 
continuing but blamed most of them on the communist rebel new 
peoples army she said human rights abuse was not a policy of her 
administration and that it was unfair to blame the problem 
exclusively on the military 
they have to give us a chance said mary concepcion bautista 
chairwoman of the commission on human rights in manila we have to 
investigate we cannot be amnesty international which just 
publishes reports they are being unfair 
amnesty said it knew of no instance of a military or police 
officer being convicted of a serious human rights offense since mrs 
aquino came to power in february 1986 in the militarycivilian 
uprising that ousted president ferdinand marcos 
alleged members of the banned communist party of the philippines 
and its military wing the new peoples army are among those who 
have said they were tortured the report said 
amnesty said it is aware the rebel army has killed captives it 
said it condemns such abuses by opposition groups but stresses 
they can never justify human rights violations by government 
forces 
the organization which won the nobel peace prize in 1977 said 
it had received no official response from the philippines to its 
march report detailing allegations of murder by military and 
paramilitary forces and instances of disappearances 
the organization did note that mrs aquino has dissolved the 
national intelligence and security agency marcos intelligence 
agency which was accused of torture 
the philippines commission on human rights issued guides on the 
rights of prisoners in may the report said and those guides were 
affirmed by leaders of the military and the national police force 
several consistent and apparently reliable reports of torture 
show that extensive legal safeguards against incommunicado 
detention illtreatment and torture are being ignored todays 
amnesty report said 
the report detailed allegations by 28 people including randolfo 
corteza 30 an alleged communist party leader arrested in february 
who said he was beaten and given electric shocks to his genitals 
he was released on bail in august 
elisa lubi 45 an alleged party finance officer claimed she was 
sexually molested while being questioned in june at the philippine 
constabularys capital region command in bicutan

maj gen robert urquhart the british commander at 
the heroic but illfated battle of arnhem who tried to capture a 
bridge over the rhine river has died his family reported today he 
was 87 
urquhart died tuesday at his home at port of menteith near 
stirling in his native scotland no cause of death was stated 
as commander of the first airborne division urquhart was at the 
forefront of the battle in september 1944 to capture a bridge over 
the rhine at arnhem the netherlands 
he survived many narrow escapes and was portrayed by sean 
connery in the 1977 movie a bridge too far which was based on 
the battle 
the battle was the climax of a usbritish operation to exploit 
german disorganization following their retreat from normandy 
france after the allied invasion of nazioccupied europe in the 
dday landings three months earlier 
the plan aimed at ending the war in europe before the end of 
1944 thereby avoiding the allies long conventional offensive with 
which the war eventually ended in 1945 
the plan was to capture five river and canal bridges in the 
netherlands to open a way for an armored advance into the north 
german plain before the onset of winter 
it required the american 101st and 82nd airborne divisions to 
capture bridges at eindhoven and nijmegen and the british first 
airborne division to capture the one at arnhem 
simultaneously with the parachute and glider landings a ground 
advance of 64 miles was planned by the british 30th corps from the 
meuseescaut canal along the same axis 
the american operations succeeded but the british whose air 
drops had to be staggered because of lack of sufficient aircraft 
encountered german forces and were able only to capture the north 
end of the arnhem bridge 
the germans who had found plans of the entire operation on the 
body of an american soldier shot down in a glider heavily 
outgunned urquharts 10000 troops 
bad weather and german assaults on the 30th corps advancing 
armored column meanwhile denied relief for urquharts troops and 
their airhead was steadily reduced 
urquhart and his men fought with heroic courage for nine days 
but with their ammunition and food virtually at an end their 
casualties rising rapidly and no hope of relief reaching them in 
time urquhart ordered a breakout 
there was no british surrender a total of 2163 of the 10000 
troops who landed at arnhem fought their way to safety in the 
american area which the 30th corps had consolidated another 1350 
were killed in the battle the rest were taken prisoner 
the failure to capture the arnhem bridge was reported as a 
bridge too short to bring victory 
urquhart narrowly escaped death when a german shell destroyed a 
jeep he was about to use on another occasion while he was in a 
house a german soldier appeared at a window before the german 
could fire urquhart shot him dead 
later while making a personal reconnaissance urquhart was cut 
off from his own headquarters he made his way back through enemy 
fire so dense that at one stage he was given up for dead 
a total of five victoria crosses britains highest decoration 
for bravery were awarded after the battle among urquharts men 
after the war urquhart became director general of the 
territorial army the british armys parttime reserve during its 
reconstruction he was later appointed commander of british forces 
in britishruled malaya which later became part of malaysia and 
from 1952 until his retirement in 1955 was the commander of british 
troops in austria 
he is survived by a wife three daughters and a son their names 
were not immediately available

eric pezzuti was dreaming of riches 
when he tried to redeem 47 stolen state lottery tickets last june 
he found out the tickets were worth 15 years in prison 
in tears the 18yearold high school dropout with 32 juvenile 
convictions was led from court after palm beach county circuit judge 
thomas sholts balked at pleas for leniency and imposed the harshest 
sentence possible 
hes graduated to the major leagues sholts said 
pezzuti scheduled for a february trial on other charges of 
dealing in stolen goods was convicted last month of trying to 
receive a free ticket for each of the tickets stolen from a juno 
beach beauty salon 
pezzutis father jim pezzuti said his son planned to appeal the 
sentence 
its sort of obvious the state attorneys are out to get him 
he said hes not really a hardened criminal 
assistant state attorney jacqui charbonneau recommended the 
sentence based on pezzutis prior juvenile record 
the elder pezzuti said his son has been in jail since his 
conviction and that probably did more to straighten him up than 
anything he did in the juvenile system 
pezzuti went through the juvenile system without being punished 
much for his crimes mostly burglaries and automobile thefts say 
family members 
he thought im never going to get in trouble theyre just 
playing with me said his sister debbie

four businessman face up to 17 years in prison 
if convicted on charges they tried to illegally aid sen alan 
cranstons campaign by funneling money to an opponent of his chief 
rival 
the fivecount federal indictment handed up wednesday contends 
that 120000 was used for an advertising campaign in support of 
american independent party candidate ed vallen who ran against 
cranston dcalif and republican rep ed zschau in 1986 
we were not involved in any way even indirectly cranston 
spokesman murray flanders said in a telephone interview from 
washington 
according to acting us attorney gary feess the defendants 
solicited some 55 contributors to write checks to green stripe 
media which produced a tv ad for vallen 
feess told a news conference that the people who wrote checks 
were reimbursed for amounts running from 1000 to 4000 he 
declined to say whether the check writers knew they were violating 
election laws 
the individuals were told different things by different 
people feess said 
feess stressed that cranston knew nothing about the plan and had 
no role in approving it there was also no evidence that anyone on 
cranstons staff was involved 
we have absolutely no evidence that senator cranston knew or 
approved of this action he said adding there is no indication 
that it had any influence on the outcome of the election cranston 
narrowly defeated zschau 
feess indicated that michael r goland 41 of beverly hills was 
the moving force in the alleged scheme 
goland was charged with conspiring with sandore habalow 45 of 
los angeles and lyle r weisman 31 of beverly hills michael b 
altman 42 of los angeles was charged with aiding and abetting the 
alleged contributions by acting as a conduit through which funds 
were passed to the media company 
if convicted goland could get up to 17 years in prison and fines 
totaling 1 million weisman and habalow each face up to 16 years 
and 875000 in fines if convicted altman could get a year and be 
fined 125000 
according to the federal election commission goland poured more 
than 1 million into a campaign against former sen charles percy 
rill in 1984 percy who lost to democrat paul simon said goland 
wanted him defeated because the businessman didnt think he was 
ardent enough in his support of israel 
goland has one issue he is rabid on percy said after his 
1984 defeat he thinks i am not enough proisrael 
during the 1986 campaign zschaus credentials on support for 
israel were questioned like percy zschau counted himself a 
supporter of israel

stuart symington might have become the nations 
36th president as successor to the slain john f kennedy said a 
longtime confidant of the late missouri senator 
symington died wednesday at his home in new canaan conn he was 
87 
symington who was the nations first secretary of the air force 
and later built a reputation as a principled politician died of 
heart disease said james symington one of his two sons 
longtime confidant clark a clifford recalled the 1969 democratic 
convention and events that could have made symington vice president 
i was carrying messages back and forth clifford said from 
washington the day before the nominating decision was to be 
made senator kennedy said im now offering the no 2 position to 
senator symington take it to him and get back to me 
clifford recalled that elements of the party pressing for a 
southerner on the ticket eventually persuaded kennedy to select 
lyndon b johnson for the vice presidency 
i took that message back to senator symington clifford 
said he seemed very relaxed about it he didnt seem to be 
hungering for it the nomination anyway 
symington was praised by both democrats and republicans 
he exuded integrity said us district judge william l 
hungate who served as a house democrat from missouri from 1964 to 
1977 there was no question of any improprieties no shadows ever 
fell on stuart symington 
he was one of those tall trees whose falling will leave a great 
vacant spot said former state treasurer james spainhower a 
democrat 
symington made his mark not only as a senator from 1952 to 1976 
but as the secretary of the air force and before that as a 
troubleshooting industrialist summoned to st louis from baltimore 
in 1937 to bring strikeplagued emerson electric co back to 
financial prosperity 
as air force secretary symington set down broad principles and 
courses of action and the decisions he made in those early days had 
substantial impact on the manner in which the air force later 
developed said clifford a former defense secretary 
sen john c danforth rmo ran against symington in 1970 and 
lost then won the seat after symington decided not to seek 
reelection in 1976 
despite the fact they were from different parties symington 
resigned from office before the term ended so danforth would have 
the most seniority of the new senators elected that year 
to consider that he did this for someone who had run against 
him for someone of the other party says a lot about this man 
about the bigness of the man and about his concern for our state 
danforth said 
although he was best known as a champion of military air in his 
more than 30 years of public service symingtons popularity at home 
was largely based on his battles for local projects 
symington was born in amherst mass in 1901 he graduated from 
yale university in 1923 and entered business 
in 1978 symington married ann nancy hemingway watson and 
moved to new caanan a wealthy connecticut community just north of 
new york city symingtons first wife evelyn wadsworth symington 
died in 1972 
in addition to his son james symington is survived by a second 
son stuart symington jr six grandchildren and six 
greatgrandchildren

a plainclothes policeman who became the fifth 
dallas officer killed this year may have been shot during an 
undercover cocaine transaction for the fun of it an 
investigator says 
lawrence r cadena who left his police desk job three years ago 
to work undercover on drug raids was killed during a shootout that 
also left a suspected drug dealer dead and two others wounded 
authorities said 
sgt james chandler described the departments mood as somber in 
what has become the deadliest year ever for the police force four 
was unbelievable he said five was just i dont know you 
dont know what to say 
police said wednesday that cadenas killer apparently didnt know 
the 17year veteran was an officer when he delivered bogus drugs to 
cadena cadenas assailant threw the fake drugs inside the car in 
which the officer was sitting then shot him at close range with a 
semiautomatic rifle tuesday 
the drug was bunk said narcotics division capt eddie walt 
said essentially they killed him for the fun of it 
cadena 43 was shot in the chest abdomen and both arms he was 
pronounced dead at baylor university medical center in dallas about 
30 minutes later 
the drug suspect hector rodriguez jocimino 36 of dallas was 
shot in the chest and back by a backup police officer authorities 
said he died later at parkland memorial hospital said an emergency 
room supervisor 
javier suarez medina 20 was in serious condition at parkland 
with wounds to the chest and abdomen while fernando fernandez 17 
was in serious condition with wounds to both legs hospital 
officials said 
police said both medina and fernandez have been charged with 
capital murder fernandez also was charged with unlawful delivery of 
a controlled substance 
police chief mack vines who called cadena a model officer 
said that all of the officers apparently followed the correct 
procedure during the undercover operation and that the presence of 
additional backup officers probably would not have prevented the 
shooting 
dallas police have been under fire from some city council members 
and community minority leaders who have accused police of being too 
triggerhappy 
a memorial service was planned for cadena today at st patricks 
catholic church in dallas

the waist down when she fell on a concrete floor while attempting a 
difficult stunt will receive 21 million from the school district 
a teacher and former principal

assumed the risk and and knew the dangers and plus she signed 
waiver of liability in case of injury

robert h pelletreau jr the us ambassador to 
tunisia assigned to open talks with the palestine liberation 
organization is one of the most experienced and knowledgable 
american diplomats on arab affairs 
colleagues say he enjoys telling about the time he was held 
hostage by palestinian terrorists for several hours in 1970 as a 
junior political officer in amman jordan and walking away from 
his captors 
he loves to recount this story a us diplomat stationed in 
europe told the associated press speaking on condition of 
anonymity he was standing there as the press conference was going 
on and he just walked away he bears them no illwill it was a 
great adventure 
pelletreau 53 of patchogue ny is fluent in arabic and 
french has served in us embassies in algeria morocco 
mauritania lebanon jordan and syria and is a former ambassador to 
bahrain 
he was named wednesday by secretary of state george p shultz as 
the only authorized channel for what shultz said would be a 
substantive dialogue with plo representatives 
the plo political headquarters is in tunis the capital of the 
north african arab nation of tunisia 
pelletreaus office referred calls today to the embassy press 
office information officer adnan siddiqi said the ambassador made a 
brief telephone call to plo headquarters to make the first contact 
he said he did not know when the first direct meeting would take 
place 
plo chairman yasser arafat met east german officials in berlin 
today and it was not known when he planned to return to tunis 
between foreign postings pelletreau served in washington as 
director of arabian peninsula affairs in the state department and as 
deputy assistant secretary of state for middle east and south asian 
affairs 
from 1985 until his assignment to tunis in march 1987 pelletreau 
shifted over to the pentagon to serve as deputy assistant secretary 
of defense for middle east and south asian affairs 
the anecdotal highlight of his career came in september 1970 
when guerrillas of george habashs popular front for the liberation 
of palestine a radical faction of the plo diverted three 
airliners to amman and took the passengers and crews hostage 
as pelletreau has told the story to colleagues he was kidnapped 
on the streets of amman by popular front guerrillas and taken with 
other hostages to a large news conference at a downtown hotel 
noting his captorss attention was diverted pelletreau edged in 
among the journalists then slipped out and walked away the 
american diplomat said 
when his absence was noticed the guerrillas sent teams out 
looking for him including one that passed him on the street but 
he made it to safety in the us embassy 
those were in the innocent days the diplomat recalled 
its almost hard to remember the days when you just didnt kill 
diplomats

the surprise us decision to open talks with 
the palestine liberation organization produced shock today in 
official israeli circles and celebrations in arab neighborhoods 
a slogan sprayed on a wall in the west bank city of ramallah 
read the american position is a victory for the uprising and 
palestinian diplomacy 
foreign minister shimon peres said the american turnabout 
represented a sad day for all of us and one firebomb in the 
occupied territories would put to shame arafats commitment to 
end terrorism 
but peres also said israel should launch a new peace initiative 
to counter the plos latest diplomatic achievements he proposed 
letting palestinians in the occupied territories elect alternative 
leaders to negotiate peace with israel 
we are facing a new situation peres told a news conference 
i hope israel will say to the palestinians stop shooting and go 
voting give up your bullets and go to your ballots 
the us announcement sparked rejoicing among residents of the 
occupied territories 
thanks to the uprising the plo and the united states are now 
working together said hanna siniora a plo supporter and editor 
of the al fajr newspaper published in arab east jerusalem 
in ramallah dozens of palestinians celebrating the us decision 
marched through the streets chanting proplo slogans and carrying 
banners reading yes to the plo and yes to the palestinian 
state 
for the first time i feel the americans are starting to listen 
to the palestinian voice and the voice of peace said a mosque 
preacher in the west bank city of nablus 
siniora and others credited palestinians yearlong revolt 
against israels 21yearoccupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
with moderating plo positions and paving the way for talks with 
washington 
the uprising pressured the palestinian leadership to take such 
positions said saed kanaan a plo supporter and businessman in 
nablus 
israel army radio called the decision a historic turning 
point 
israelis woke up today to a whole new political reality in the 
middle east said army radio correspondent oz frankel 
avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said in 
a telephone interview we believe that the united states will 
realize very soon what the true policies of the plo are and will 
then realize that its latest step has not furthered the cause of 
peace in the middle east 
the us move could further divide israels two major political 
camps and upset sensitive negotiations to bring peress labor party 
and shamirs likud bloc together in a unity government 
one sign of new friction was peres renewed an attack on likud 
for thwarting his exploratory contacts with jordan last year which 
he said would have prevented the plo initiative on july 31 king 
hussein of jordan cut all administrative ties to the west bank 
allowing the plo to fill the vacuum 
in the 1967 middle east war israeli seized the west bank from 
jordan and gaza from egypt 
peres also warned shamir indirectly today that he would not join 
a new government that failed to actively pursue peace 
likud politicians angrily denounced the us move 
benjamin netanyahu a former un ambassador and close associate 
of shamir said the united states has breached its policy of not 
talking to the plo and the credibility of the united states has 
been compromised 
the american government has been either duped or they are 
deceiving themselves the american government will regret what they 
have done once they realize who they are dealing with he said in 
a telephone interview 
the us decision was welcomed however by a leading member of 
the liberal citizens rights movement which was allied with the 
labor party in the nov 1 parliament elections 
its a great victory for american policy said ran cohen a 
parliament member of the small party with this new success we 
are at the beginning of the peace process

some foreign rescue teams have given up 
hope of finding more survivors in the rubble left by the armenian 
earthquake and they are heading home the top us disaster relief 
official said today 
however soviet officials said the rescue effort would continue 
and denied reports that stricken cities would be bulldozed to 
prevent an epidemic 
voices and other signs of life in the ruins dropped sharply after 
monday night when temperatures plummeted to below freezing said 
julia taft director of the us foreign disaster assistance office 
at a news briefing in moscow 
the hope of finding any more survivors is ended she said 
the official news agency tass reported that rescuers were still 
searching on wednesday soviet health minister yevgeny chazov vowed 
to continue the effort because 60 survivors had been found in the 
previous 24 hours 
soviet media reported looting of fur coats from the rubble tents 
from relief supplies at the yerevan airport and even jewelry from 
corpses tass said cargo is now being shipped from the airport under 
guard 
soviet officials say the dec 7 quake killed 55000 people in 
northwestern armenia and left about 500000 of the areas 700000 
people homeless 
tass said wednesday that 48 villages had been destroyed in 
addition to the city of spitak the larger cities of leninakan and 
kirovakan suffered major damage and ms taft said another 52 
villages also were damaged tass reported wednesday that 21755 
bodies have been counted and identified so far 
rescue teams with search dogs from italy and west germany told 
jeff sallot of the globe and mail of toronto that soviet authorities 
had ordered them home saying they were ready to blast the ruins of 
buildings in spitak and bulldoze the rubble to prevent decomposing 
bodies from starting an epidemic 
the soviet embassy in france denied similar reports from french 
media on wednesday tass reported 
some foreign rescue workers said they planned to keep combing the 
crumbled buildings for life despite fog and rain that was turning 
to snow 
we continue to look for people especially with dogs said 
dr georges dallemagne of the relief organization doctors without 
borders we think there are chances for about another week to find 
a few people 
however ms taft said the dogs sense of smell becomes 
overwhelmed with the stench of death after several days and they 
can no longer find survivors 
michael tamillow of virginia said his team found two survivors 
tuesday but none on wednesday tass reported but the house where 
we dug tuesday also seemed hopeless so we do not have the right to 
leave tamillow said 
snarled supply lines also have hampered the relief effort and 
pravda quoted gen lt vc dubinyak today as saying some of the 
medicine and other cargo pouring in from around the world was being 
stolen from zvarnots airport in yerevan the armenian capital 
authorities have recovered more than 400000 worth of stolen goods 
he said 
sergei movsisyan a yerevan volunteer for the international red 
cross said today that 20000 tents should have been delivered to 
leninakan but no one knows what happened to them 
police caught one man with four foreign tents and three boxes of 
bulgarian canned meat stolen from the airport tass reported today 
quoting victor eren deputy interior minister of armenia 
tass quoted eren saying a man from the village of abobyan was 
caught stealing watches jewelry and medicine from bodies in 
kirovakan 
the international red cross warning of the worsening weather 
appealed wednesday for heavyduty tents blankets and stoves for at 
least 20000 armenian families left homeless 
it is freezing at night and it is much colder in the 
villages dallemagne said there are very few tents in 
villages and there is no heat 
snowfall and hazardous road conditions in the mountainous region 
also have hampered the relief efforts and the next few days are 
expected to bring more snow and strong winds of up to 45 mph 
fog delayed the arrival of flights from moscow and relief 
workers arriving by plane couldnt find enough buses to take them to 
their destinations the airport in yerevan is a total mess 
dallemagne said there are planes and people all over the place 
and nobody can find anybody else

the original war of the worlds radio script 
including ultimately failed efforts by cbs censors to tone down the 
realism fetched 143000 at auction 
the script sold at sothebys auction house on wednesday had sat 
in writer howard kochs file cabinet for years after the 1938 orson 
welles production panicked millions of listeners convinced the world 
was being invaded by mars 
i had a private offer of 60000 they advised me to take the 
gamble i guess it was the right gamble koch said in a telephone 
interview from california koch adapted the script from hg wells 
book for the mercury theater 
the 46page script contains welles handwritten changes as well 
as deletions and alterations by the censors welles made numerous 
changes before air time to smooth the transitions between the music 
and news flashes 
i thought it was a pretty good price for six days of work 
koch said after an anonymous buyer snapped up the broadcasting 
relic of course i was making 75 a week then for weekly radio 
shows 
the broadcast boosted kochs career he went to hollywood where 
his screenwriting credits included casablanca with humphrey 
bogart for which he won an oscar 
it was resting in my file he said when friends came to 
visit he said they wanted to see the oscar they never asked me 
about this 
koch didnt know at first what a stir his realistic script had 
caused tired from aroundtheclock work he went home to sleep 
during the broadcast the next morning he heard people on the 
street talking about invasion and war 
i rushed into a barber shop and said are we at war the 
barber held up the newspaper headline about the panic it was very 
strange he said afterward they raised me to the magnificent 
sum of 125 a week

former heavyweight boxing champion muhammad ali 
suddenly has taken responsibility for a flurry of recent phone calls 
to politicians and journalists following reports that an ali 
telephone impostor had made the calls 
ive been making the calls ali told a news conference on the 
steps of the capitol on wednesday 
the atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution had reported 
last week that ali told sports columnist david kindred he was not 
responsible for the phone calls which the newspaper said were aimed 
at promoting projects for personal gain 
at his washington news conference ali acknowledged that he had 
told the atlanta newspaper he did not make the phone calls but he 
said he made the denial in order to escape questioning by kindred 
who kept following me around 
i told him i didnt make the calls just to get him off my 
back ali said 
the atlanta newspaper reported that an ali voice this year 
had called at least six us senators two administrative 
assistants 10 press secretaries nine journalists 14 senatorial 
aides thenattorney general edwin meese iii and arthur b 
culvahouse jr counsel to president reagan 
glenn mccutchen managing editor of the atlanta journal and the 
atlanta constitution said we absolutely believe that everything 
we published was dead on the money and nothing mr ali has said 
today changes my mind about that 
muhammad ali on more than one occasion has said he did not make 
the phone calls to politicians mccutchen said he has said that 
to david kindred he has said that to at least two other friends of 
alis on one occasion other than today he has told us he did not 
make the calls 
the newspapers report suggested that many of the calls may have 
been made by alis attorney richard m hirschfeld of 
charlottesville va who according to associates quoted by the 
newspaper does a convincing impersonation of the former champ 
at his news conference ali said hirschfeld told him that the 
newspaper story was crazy 
how can somebody use my voice ali said 
ali told reporters that hirschfeld had set up meetings last 
spring with several politicians including sens orrin g hatch 
rutah edward m kennedy dmass strom thurmond rsc and john 
warner rva as well as with meese 
i did this because i had things i wanted to say he said in a 
handwritten statement 
now that i am not boxing i want to fight poverty world hunger 
and etc the statement said i also campaign for people i trust 
and believe in like george bush steven saltzburg who became an 
assistant attorney general and others 
my life is full of controversy he said so dont be 
surprised because i will be making more phone calls 
asked how the original story had come about ali said kindred 
kept following me around asking me did i make phone calls to 
senators he followed me so much i just said no i havent made 
no calls so he wasnt writing and didnt have no pen i looked up 
and a week or two later and read in the paper that ali didnt make 
the calls im here to tell you it was me i did make the calls 
ali denied that hirschfeld had impersonated him he described the 
attorney as the best friend a man can have

the justice department says employers whose 
workers are killed or injured on the job can be prosecuted for 
murder manslaughter or assault under state laws and cannot seek 
refuge under federal workplace safety laws 
the department in an opinion released wednesday in response to a 
request from a congressional committee said criminal penalties in 
the 1970 occupational safety and health act do not preempt state 
and local criminal laws 
we see nothing in the act or its legislative history which 
indicates that congress intended for the relatively limited criminal 
penalties provided by the act to deprive employees of the protection 
provided by state criminal laws of general applicability the 
department said 
the opinion flies in the face of several recent state court 
rulings throwing out criminal convictions against employers whose 
workers were injured through violations of federal job safety 
standards

today the us decision was a reasonable action going in the right 
direction

vietnam today gave a us military team 
38 sets of suspected remains of missing american servicemen in the 
largest such repatriation since the vietnam war ended a us 
spokesman said 
a us military honor guard loaded the remains each in metal 
caskets topped with us flags onto an air force plane during a 
solemn 50minute ceremony at hanoi airport said lt col thomas j 
boyd of the us pacific command 
he said the plane took off for honolulu where the army central 
identification laboratory will determine if the remains belong to 
any of the 1747 americans listed as missing in action or mia in 
vietnam 
they presented possible names associated with some of the 
remains boyd said the remains are all associated with 
incidents in the northern provinces they said they were found in 
lots of different circumstances and some of the remains were found 
by local villagers 
boyd said the vietnamese also turned over information on 12 other 
missing americans 
xinhua the official chinese news agency quoted unidentified 
vietnamese sources as saying vietnam will step up the search for 
american mias and has agreed to accept more us teams to conduct 
searches 
the previous largest turnover of suspected mia remains involved 
27 sets handed over april 6 
boyd said a fourmember team of us forensic experts examined 45 
boxes of other remains in hanoi and found some they recommended be 
analysed in the united states earlier reports had said 80 sets of 
remains were examined 
the other three teams searched binh tri thien and nghe tinh 
provinces in northcentral vietnam looking at us warplane crash 
sites and interviewing villagers who witnessed the crashes boyd 
said their 10day project ended today 
investigators focus on 70 discrepancy cases where the united 
states says vietnamese authorities should have information

fighting in the conflict which claimed the lives of about 58000 
americans and ended in the communist victory over the usbacked 
south vietnamese government in april 1975 
bitter political bickering between hanoi and washington has often 
blocked accounting for the us missing the us government says it 
will not consider normalizing relations with vietnam until hanoi 
withdraws all its troops from cambodia and resolves the mia issue

china said today that a dutch woman broke the law 
by being at the scene of a tibetan demonstration during which 
chinese police shot her in the arm 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said christa meindersma of 
amsterdam violated a law that forbids foreigners to mingle with 
tibetans during riots she was among at least 13 people injured 
during the protest saturday in lhasa the tibetan capital in which 
chinese officials said a tibetan buddhist monk was killed 
western witnesses said they saw two bodies including that of a 
small child and that tibetans told them seven people were killed 
li said ms meindersma also violated customs regulations by 
bringing into lhasa a book by the dalai lama tibets exiled former 
leader the book my land and my people is banned in china 
because it advocates tibets independence from china 
ms meindersma told the associated press in a telephone interview 
from lhasa that she was reading the book to learn tibetan she said 
police confiscated the book and her passport 
earlier this week authorities barred ms meindersma from leaving 
lhasa but gave her permission to leave wednesday at the request of 
the dutch government 
ms meindersma schwartz and other western witnesses said 
saturdays protest began when about 30 tibetans walked silently into 
lhasas central market square behind a monk carrying the banned flag 
of precommunist tibet 
the witnesses said police opened fire on the crowd without 
warning chinas official media maintains the police gave a warning 
first and then fired in the air 
ms meindersma told the ap she stood not among the demonstrators 
but with a large crowd of curious onlookers she said police 
continued firing at her and others even as they ran from the scene 
in panic 
li refused to say if any formal charges had been brought against 
ms meindersma but willem de bruin adminstrative and consular 
attache at the dutch embassy said today that authorities told him 
no charges would be filed 
li did not acknowledge that ms meindersma was shot by police 
and only spoke of her being slightly injured she said a bullet 
entered her left arm and exited through her shoulder 
tibetan activists seeking the return of the dalai lama and an end 
to 38 years of chinese communist rule have demonstrated repeatedly 
over the past 14 months saturdays confrontation was the third 
protest to end in bloodshed 
according to western travelers at least 38 people were killed in 
violent clashes with police on oct 1 1987 and march 5 
the dalai lama headed tibets civil administration before 
communist chinese troops entered in 1950 he fled to india in 1959 
during an abortive antichinese uprising

former us sen stuart symington a champion 
and watchdog of the nations military who died at age 87 was 
offered then denied the no 2 spot on the 1960 presidential 
ticket with john f kennedy a friend says 
the former missouri senator who died wednesday at his home in 
new canaan conn was the nations first air force secretary and 
built a reputation as a principled politician he died of heart 
disease said son james symington 
he was at first a champion of military air power and big military 
outlays but opposed the vietnam war became increasingly critical 
of defense spending and excessive secrecy and was an opponent of 
the f14 fighter 
washington lawyer and former defense secretary clark a clifford 
recalled the 1960 democratic convention and events that could have 
made symington vice president 
the day before the decision was to be made senator kennedy 
said im now offering the no 2 position to senator symington 
take it to him and get back to me he said 
clifford said symington accepted but kennedy backed out under 
strong pressure to select a southerner and went with lyndon b 
johnson of texas 
i took that back to senator symington clifford said he 
seemed very relaxed about it he didnt seem to be hungering for it 
the nomination anyway 
symington served as a senator from 1953 until his retirement in 
1977 and held various posts in the truman administration including 
air force secretary in 194750 and assistant secretary of war for 
air in 194647 
he was a favoriteson candidate for the democatic presidential 
nomination in 1956 and 1960 
before that he was a troubleshooting industrialist summoned to 
st louis to bring strikeplagued emerson electric co back to 
financial prosperity in 1937 
he exuded integrity said us district judge william l 
hungate who served as a house democrat from missouri from 1964 to 
1977 there was no question of any improprieties no shadows ever 
fell on stuart symington 
he was one of those tall trees whose falling will leave a great 
vacant spot said former state treasurer james spainhower a 
democrat 
sen john c danforth rmo won symingtons seat after he 
decided not to seek reelection in 1976 symington resigned before 
his term ended so danforth would have the most seniority of the new 
senators elected that year 
to consider that he did this for someone who had run against 
him for someone of the other party says a lot about this man 
about the bigness of the man and about his concern for our state 
danforth said 
symington was born in amherst mass in 1901 he graduated from 
yale university in 1923 and entered business 
in 1978 symington married ann nancy hemingway watson and 
moved to new caanan a wealthy connecticut community just north of 
new york city symingtons first wife evelyn wadsworth symington 
died in 1972 
in addition to his wife and son symington is survived by another 
son stuart symington jr six grandchildren and six 
greatgrandchildren

a 41yearold swede was remanded in 
custody today on suspicion of killing prime minister olof palme 
raising hopes for a solution to the mystery which has traumatized 
sweden for nearly three years 
chief prosecutor anders helin filed the remand order in stockholm 
district court a day after the arrest of the man whose name was 
withheld by authorities prosecutors said he denied killing palme 
the move means that authorities feel they have enough evidence to 
make a case against the suspect and may hold him indefinitely for 
further interrogation 
he was arrested wednesday and after a full day of questioning 
was booked on suspicion of having committed the murder deputy 
prosecutorgeneral axel morath told reporters 
palme was shot as he walked home with his wife from a latenight 
movie feb 28 1986 
there is reason to believe it will be a difficult case said 
arne liljefors the lawyer assigned to defend the suspect 
he is the first person arrested on suspicion of being the 
mysterious gunman dubbed the grand man who followed palme for 
several hundred feet after he left the grand theater and then shot 
him 
the national news agency tt said witnesses identified the suspect 
in a lineup as the grand man apparently a key factor in the 
decision to arrest him formally 
investigators have been sharply criticized by several government 
inquiry commissions for mishandling the manhunt and squabbling among 
themselves the chief detective in the case has been replaced twice 
the polices inability to find the murderer has created a 
national trauma in our country and undermined the citizens 
faith in the legal system the aftonbladet daily said today 
if the murder of olof palme isnt cleared up it will remain 
like a sickness in swedish society thats why a lot of people 
hope the suspect arrested wednesday really is the killer it said 
in an editorial 
palme was a fourterm prime minister of this neutral nation and a 
leader of the world disarmament movement 
investigators refused to officially release information on the 
suspect but swedish police reporters were given access to his 
record reports said he has 63 convictions and has spent the last 22 
years in and out of prisons or psychiatric wards for dangerous 
criminals 
the man was convicted of stabbing an alleged drug addict to death 
with a bayonet in 1970 just a few yards from where palme was shot 16 
years later 
police offered no possible motive but news reports said the 
suspect has spoken in a hostile and threatening manner about palme 
in the past 
the initial inquiry focused on a political motive ousted iranian 
president abolhassan banisadr claimed ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
ordered palmes slaying when the prime minister discovered and 
stopped a swedish companys illegal arms shipments to tehran

lifting a 1000ton reactor vessel from 
its underground site at the nations first commercial nuclear plant 
was the hard part but officials still have to take the 41foot 
vessel 7800 miles to the dump 
the reactor pressure vessel and neutronshield tank packed with 
concrete were lifted from the ground wednesday at the shippingport 
nuclear plant and placed on a specially made transporter to be taken 
to a storage site to until spring 
the vessel then will be put on a barge and shipped 7800 miles 
via several rivers and two oceans to a military dump in washington 
state 
the plant is the largest nuclear unit and only commercial reactor 
in the world to be dismantled several nuclear plants have been 
mothballed or entombed 
the raising of the reactor pressure vessel is the most dramatic 
stage of the fiveyear dismantling of the plant dedicated by 
president eisenhower in 1957 and retired in 1982 after generating 
about 65 billion kilowatts 
everything worked just like we expected it to its been very 
successful said karen wheeless spokeswoman for the energy 
department which owns the plant 
representatives of the two companies responsible for the 5 
million operation expressed satisfaction about the job 
this is not the biggest lift ever made but its one of the 
most complicated said don nolan jr of williams crane amp rigging 
inc of richmond va it took about six months just to get ready 
for this 
wednesdays big move was also the federal governments attempt to 
prove that reactors can be dismantled safely and affordably 
providing a model for utilities when their reactors have outlived 
their usefulness 
youve got to take reactors from the cradle to the grave if 
you cant handle the burial theres some question of whether you 
should be handling a reactor at all wheeless said 
even success for the shippingport operation will not solve the 
problem facing the commercial nuclear power industry of where to 
dispose of highlevel commercial waste 
while waste from shippingport is going to military dumps in idaho 
and at hanford wash a national repository for spent fuel that was 
to open in 1998 probably wont be open until the next century 
wheeless said 
the energy department estimates 15 us nuclear plants will reach 
the end of their 30 to 40year useful lives by the year 2000 
almost all of the 12000 metric tons of spent uranium from private 
reactors is being stored in holding ponds 
lowlevel radiation is left in the shippingport reactor but 
unless you attach it to your body and wear it as an undergarment 
there is no danger wheeless said 
federal officials intend to remove all radioactive material so 
the site 30 miles northwest of pittsburgh can be returned to 
unrestricted use the decommissioning is expected to be completed by 
1990 at a cost of 98 million 
the cylindrical reactor will be rolled to the ohio river and 
placed on a 200foot barge in the spring and shipped via the ohio 
and mississippi rivers the gulf of mexico panama canal pacific 
ocean and columbia river to hanford

a roman catholic order said today it had expelled an 
activist priest in haiti it accused of instigating violence and 
exalting class warfare the priest was the apparent target of a 
september attack that killed 13 people 
the rev jean bertrand aristide had been at odds with superiors 
of his salesian order in rome for some time he had been ordered to 
leave his homeland and go to canada by oct 17 
but aristide 35 defied the order and a spokesman for the 
salesian order the rev giuseppe costa said he is still on the 
island 
a communique by the salesian society of st john bosco said 
aristide has rebuffed repeated attempts to correct his behavior 
which they described as in contrast with his salesian and priestly 
vocation 
the type of political commitment he has assumed is in serious 
contrast with the clear will of the founder of the order in 
addition the incitement to hate and violence the exaltation of 
class struggle go directly against that fidelity to the teaching 
of the church that forms a living part of the salesian spirit 
it called him a destabilizing element for haitian roman 
catholics 
aristide has led calls for an uprooting of the vestiges of the 
former regime of jeanclaude duvalier who was overthrown in 1986 
in september aristide was the apparent object of a bloody attack 
on his church in the haitian capital of portauprince during a 
sunday mass by thugs linked to the ousted regime 
thirteen people were killed and more than 70 were wounded 
aristide escaped 
the massacre provoked another military coup in which 
rankandfile soldiers ousted lt gen henri namphy and replaced him 
with lt gen prosper avril 
the statement said the action by the order was painful but 
that there was no way aristide could remain a salesian without 
changing his ways 
the salesians continue to pray for jean b aristide still 
nourishing the hope of a sincere fraternal embrace as soon as he 
wants it the statement said 
the orders spokesman said the decree which was ratified by the 
vatican last week did not change aristides status as a priest

federal health officials today announced a 
new aids study that will focus on heterosexual men and women at high 
risk of contracting the fatal disease because of multiple sex 
partners or other factors 
the sexual transmission and progression of aids among 
heterosexuals is virtually unexplored territory said dr stanley 
h weiss one of the nations leading aids researchers who will head 
the study in newark 
in effect we will be helping to write the book on this 
subject said weiss head of the department of preventive medicine 
at the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey 
the national instituteof allergy and infectious diseases in 
washington said the study is to be conducted among 2000 
heterosexuals in newark nj and brooklyn ny over a fiveyear 
period 
dr anthony s fauci director of the institute said the purpose 
of the study is to develop more effective strategies for the 
prevention and treatment of aids or acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome in a population that is not homosexual or using 
intravenous drugs 
only about 4 percent of the adult aids cases can be traced to 
heterosexual contact but such sexual conduct accounts for 30 
percent of all aids cases among women the niaid said 
the study will concentrate on heterosexuals with a history of 
what is considered to be highrisk behavior for contracting aids 
the factors include 
an average of 10 or more sex partners a year 
a history of sexually transmitted disease within the last five 
years 
sexual contact with persons such as homosexuals or intravenous 
drug users who are considered to be at high risk for aids 
those infected or exposed to fungal viral retroviral 
bacterial or parasitic infections that are thought to increase the 
risk of acquiring aids 
intravenous drug users a group with one of the highest rates of 
aids infection are excluded from the study 
newark and brooklyn were selected for the study the niaid said 
because they are located in innercity areas populated by large 
numbers of hivinfected drug users a potential reservoir of 
infectivity for heterosexuals 
hiv or human immunodeficiency virus is the organism that causes 
aids 
a thousand heterosexual men and women will be recruited for the 
new jersey portion of the study they will come from counseling and 
test sites set up by the state in three health facilities in 
northern new jersey and from a newark hospital 
the new york study will concentrate on recruiting heterosexual 
women but a select group of men who are sexual partners of female 
members of the study group also will be sought the new york study 
also will seek steady male sexual partners of women who test 
positive for aids after first testing negative the new york cohort 
will be recruited from clinics in the brooklyn area and from the 
sex partners of the aids population in the area 
drs sheldon h landesman and jack a dehovitz of the state 
university of new yorkhealth science center at brooklyn will head 
the second study a data collection and coordination center in ann 
arbor mich will be headed by richard cornell of the university of 
michigan school of public health 
strict patient confidentiality is to be observed in both study 
areas the niaid said 
the niaid said the goal of the studies is to determine the 
natural history of aids infection among heterosexual men and women 
who have no history of intravenous drug use to examine sexual 
behaviors associated with spread of hiv in such a group and any 
biological or environmental cofactors that affect the spread and 
severity of the disease 
the institute is awarding fiveyear contracts to conduct the 
research the cost for the first year is about 4 million the 
agency said 
niaid is one of the national institutes of health and is the 
agency primarily responsible for directing the federal governments 
scientific study of aids 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering the victim incapable of resisting other diseases 
and infections the virus most often is spread through close contact 
with blood blood products or semen from infected persons it also 
is spread from an infected mother to an infant during or just after 
birth 
as of dec 5 1988 aids had been diagnosed in 79823 americans 
of whom more than half or 44826 have died since june 1 1981 
according to federal statistics no one is known to have recovered 
from aids

the un general assembly today voted 
overwhelmingly for the convening of an international middle east 
peace conference and for temporarily placing the israelioccupied 
territories under un supervision 
the united states and israel voted against the action 
the vote on the resolution came after the new us willingness to 
talk to the plo drew a widely positive response 
the final tally was 1382 with two abstentions canada and costa 
rica iran did not participate in the vote and libya and syria 
voted yes with reservations saying they did not recognize israel 
which was mentioned in the resolution 
the vote closed out a threeday debate on palestine which was 
held in geneva after the united states refused to grant plo chairman 
yasser arafat a visa to speak at the united nations in new york 
the main resolution passed by the general assembly calls for the 
convening of an international conference under un auspices with 
the participation of all parties to the conflict including the 
palestine liberation organization on an equal footing 
it requests the un security council to establish a preparatory 
committee for convening the conference 
the resolution affirms principles for achieving comprehensive 
peace including the withdrawal of israel from the palestinian 
territory occupied since 1967 including jerusalem and the other 
occupied arab territories 
the resolution also notes the expressed desire and endeavors to 
place the palestinian territory occupied since 1967 including 
jerusalem under the supervision of the united nations for a limited 
period as part of the peace process 
a separate resolution acknowledges the proclamation of the 
state of palestine by the palestine national council on nov 15 
it says that effective dec 15 the designation palestine 
will replace palestine liberation organization in the un 
system but the move did not amount to un recognition of a 
palestinian state 
that resolution passed 1042 with the united states and israel 
again opposed thirtysix countries abstained 
us ambassador to geneva joseph petrone in a statement 
explaining his countrys negative votes on the resolutions said 
they are unhelpful and inconsistent with the search for peace 
referring to the call for un supervision in the occupied 
territories petrone said the proposal was impractical and 
unrealistic adding we cannot support such a concept 
petrone reiterated the announcement wednesday by secretary of 
state george shultz that the plo had met the three conditions the 
us had set for direct usplo contacts explicitly announcing its 
acceptance of security council resolutions 242 and 338 calling for 
israeli withdrawal from land it occupied in 1967 and recognizing 
safe and secure borders for all middle east states recognizing 
israels right to exist and renouncing terrorism 
at least 323 palestinians and 13 israelis have died in a yearlong 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip

michigan state democratic chairman richard 
wieners campaign to become national party chairman suffered a blow 
at the hands of his own governor just as the battle for the top 
party job widened 
wiener has been regarded as one of the leading contenders to 
succeed retiring democratic national chairman paul kirk but 
michigan gov james blanchards remark wednesday that he lacks the 
stature required for the post was widely viewed as damaging his 
prospects 
i like rick he did a great job here in michigan and is a dear 
friend blanchard told the detroit news but there is obviously 
a strong feeling that the chairman ought to be a presidential type 
of candidate a party spokesman who can be on television responding 
to george bush a person of existing national stature 
blanchard in an interview with the associated press later said 
he did not intend his remarks as criticism of wiener and regarded 
him as a good choice if were looking for a nutsandbolts guy 
blanchard said he was not yet endorsing any of the candidates 
because as chairman of the democratic governors association he wants 
to consult with the other governors 
the race for the democratic chairmanship widened as two more 
candidates former reps james r jones of oklahoma and michael 
barnes of maryland formally announced 
a third candidate former top jesse jackson aide ronald h brown 
rounded up the endorsement of former presidential candidate bruce 
babbitt in his attempt to establish broader credentials in the party 
wiener sought to put the best face on blanchards comment saying 
it was candid and positive 
what i have done throughout my professional career is put 
together campaigns and later a state party that has elected a lot of 
people wiener said 
jones a longtime party insider said he hoped to avoid a 
divisive freeforall that some are predicting would pit the jackson 
wing of the party against southerners conservatives and moderates 
i think there is a myth that this is a bloodbath type of 
election jones said 
the nearly 400 voting members of the democratic national 
committee will select a new chairman to replace kirk when they meet 
in washington on feb 9 and 10 
babbitt endorsed brown in a letter to committee members he said 
brown would not be a stalking horse for jesse jackson but an 
effective party builder 
jones former chairman of the house budget committee is a 
moderatetoconservative democrat who said he would draw on a base 
of support among democrats in the south and west 
my southern and western roots place me at the center of our 
partys beliefs and ideals he said in a statement 
also a factor however is a move by alabama party chairman john 
baker and others to have a current member of congress such as sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas serve as chairman but that would require a 
change of the partys charter to permit a parttime chairman a 
difficult maneuver needing a twothirds vote of the committee 
jones said he believed he had more than 100 votes among the 
committee members so far but acknowledged some were not firm 
commitments the race is expected to be expensive and jones said he 
is prepared to spend as much as brown perhaps 150000

as they discussed the longawaited development with reporters 
plo spokesman ahmed abdel rahman said the us decision meant a 
historic change in the struggle in the middle east 
the white houses reversal came after arafat told a news 
conference in geneva on wednesday that he renounced all forms of 
terrorism and recognized israels right to live in peace and 
security 
hours later president reagan said the united states would begin 
a dialogue with the plo secretary of state george p shultz said 
the plo had finally met us criteria for negotiations 
indeed the envoy authorized with initiating contact with the plo 
made a brief phone call today to plo headquarters in tunisia a 
spokesman for the ambassador robert h pelletreau jr had no 
further details 
no date has been set for the talks but a state department 
official in washington speaking on condition of anonymity said 
were sure the plo will try to have them take place as soon as 
possible 
arafat was in east berlin today for what the staterun adn news 
agency said was a working visit and met with east german communist 
leader erich honecker he later left for bucharest romania the 
agency said 
adn quoted arafat as telling honecker the plo is striving for a 
comprehensive settlement of the middle east conflict that would 
guarantee to all those involved a life in dignity freedom and 
peace 
israeli officials were shocked 
they said arafats remarks were insufficient because the plo did 
not rule out violence associated with the palestinian uprising 
which began dec 8 1987 in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
and has claimed the lives of 323 palestinians and 13 israelis 
on tuesday arafat told the un general assembly in geneva that 
the plo accepts the right of all parties concerned in the middle 
east conflict to exist in peace and security and as i have 
mentioned including the state of palestine israel and other 
neighbors 
he also said the plo accepted un resolutions 242 and 338 which 
recognize the right of all middle east nations to safe and secure 
borders 
that acceptance was one of three conditions set by us law for 
dialogue with the plo the others were a clear recognition of israel 
and renunciation of terrorism by the plo 
in jerusalem foreign minister shimon peres said his country 
should launch a peace initiative of its own to counter the plos 
latest diplomatic achievements he proposed letting palestinians in 
the occupied lands elect alternative leaders to negotiate peace with 
israel 
shultz said wednesday night that the united states does not 
recognize the declaration of an independent palestinian state 
made by the plo in algeria last month but that it would be a 
subject of discussion 
in a speech before the world body on wednesday us ambassador 
vernon walters had said the world should tell israelis and arabs it 
is tired of their long conflict 
walters urged israel to face up to the need for withdrawal from 
occupied territories which it seized in the 1967 middle east war 
the lands are home to 17 million palestinians and 70000 jewish 
settlers

koreas national airline to send commercial jets through soviet 
airspace and make refueling stops in moscow a newspaper reported 
thursday 
the newspaper hankook ilbo said cho chungkun president of 
korean air will visit moscow later this month to work out details 
of the agreement 
kal neither confirmed nor denied the report

korea temporarily allowed kal planes to fly over its territory to 
transport european and african athletes to the 1988 summer olympics 
in seoul this fall

to extend the decision but the soviet union which is closely 
allied with seouls archrival north korea has been reluctant to

the state treasurer has asked the 
federal government to investigate an unexplained 200 million loss 
in west virginias investment fund for local governments 
the loss has sparked a run on the fund by the local governments 
which have withdrawn more than 100 million in the past three days 
three annual reports show that investments in the consolidated 
investment funds pool 100 totaled 7733 million in 1986 that 
figure dropped to 5741 million a year later a decrease of 1992 
million 
no one can say whether the loss represents reduced interest 
money the state thought it would earn but didnt or an actual loss 
in funds invested 
the fund was earning a high rate of interest up to 13 percent 
or more during the period when the loss occurred according to two 
annual reports for the state board of investments and one from the 
state treasurers office 
state county and municipal governments put their money into the 
pool which the state then invests for them 
treasurer a james manchin on tuesday urged a federal 
investigation into why the fund which his office manages suffered 
the loss 
us attorney michael carey said he has passed on to the fbi 
manchins request that officials determine whether an investigation 
is warranted the fbi has not said whether it will investigate 
manchin said he does not believe any criminal wrongdoing is 
involved just bad investments 
other probes including one by the accounting firm of touche ross 
amp co are under way 
over the past three days local governments have withdrawn 1089 
million including 413 million wednesday in reaction to reports 
of the loss 
several key people involved in the 200 million loss refuse to 
discuss it 
associate treasurer arnold t margolin who was in charge of 
investments has said he alerted manchin to the problem and is 
awaiting the results of the touche ross probe 
manchin oversees all state investments but accused margolin of 
not handling the investments properly he said staff members of the 
investments office warned margolin in 1987 that there was a problem 
but he said margolin who has resigned to become an administrative 
aide to govelect gaston caperton ignored them 
manchin has refused to accept margolins resignation until the 
loss is cleared up 
former assistant treasurer kathy lester who actually made the 
investments for margolin disappeared after quitting the treasurers 
office in late 1987 
gov arch moore chairman of the board of investments has 
declined to comment

japanese and american tourists and businessmen can 
travel to each others countries without a visa beginning thursday 
under a pilot program that could boost the flow of freespending 
japanese to america 
travel industry spokesmen were unanimous in welcoming the change 
for if nothing else ending the hassle of spending time or money to 
get a visa 
the change will result in a bit more more paperwork for the 
airlines and a lot less for the us embassy in tokyo expectations 
on both sides are that japanese travel to the united states will 
increase 
spending an average 1000 each aside from airline tickets 22 
million japanese travelers went to the united states in 1987 the 
most from any country the projection for 1988 is 26 million 
usbound travelers said fritz m schmitz regional director of 
the us travel and tourism administration an arm of the us 
commerce department 
only 430000 american tourists and businessmen visited japan in 
1987 making tourism one of the few sectors where the united states 
has a trade surplus with japan about 1 billion last year 
schmitz said it wasnt clear how much effect the visawaiver 
program would have but that some estimates predicted a 10 percent 
increase in usbound travel from japan 
those of us in tourism promotion have been pushing for it for 
years schmitz said in a telephone interview freedom to travel 
is an important part of better international relations 
he acknowledged that the united states still a magnet for 
immigration was more difficult for tourists to enter than some 
other countries americans can enter most european countries without 
a visa but europeans have to obtain visas to travel to america 
in 1986 the us congress passed a law authorizing negotiations 
with other countries to waive certain visa requirements the first 
agreement with britain went into effect in july and japan is the 
second to embark on a pilot program that will be reassessed in 1991 
robyn bishop chief of the visa branch at the us embassy 
cautioned that the waiver was voluntary and some travelers probably 
still would want a visa stamped in their passports the waiver 
doesnt apply to people intending longer stays such as students 
journalists researchers exchange visitors or people about to marry 
and move to the united states ms bishop said 
travelers without visas will have to convince immigration 
officers at us entry points that they are a bona fide tourist or 
businessman by producing a return ticket or one for another 
destination and there can be no extensions of the 90day limit or 
appeals if a traveler is turned back she said 
we think the japanese are the right kind of traveler to take 
advantage of the visa program she said they take short 
vacations often in tour groups on fixed itineraries 
ms bishop expected the new rule would shorten the lines outside 
the tokyo embassy which peaked at 1665 one day in february a time 
when many young japanese travel after the school year ends and 
before they start jobs in april 
she said about 95 percent of the 930000 visas issued in tokyo 
last year were for tourism and business visitors 
at the japan travel bureau which sent almost 400000 people to 
the united states in 1987 spokesman keiichi tsujino said the change 
would ease inconvenience and stimulate more travel 
for example if a client thinks of going to the united states 
he can go instantly tsujino said this is a welcome change

just before dawn friday a few 
dozen bearded men in leather clothes will take cover behind oxdrawn 
wagons and fight an imaginary battle against a longago defeated 
zulu army 
the pageant by members of rightwing afrikaner cultural and 
political groups will celebrate the battle of blood river and the 
150th anniversary of the great trek that brought the dutchdescended 
pioneers out of the britishruled cape colony into the african 
wilderness 
it wont matter that the makebelieve battle wont be seen by 
very many people or that it is being staged 20 miles from the 
governments main celebration at the pioneer monument overlooking 
pretoria 
most of the events and celebrations are symbolic and in south 
africa there are many ways of interpreting them 
depending on the interpretation the 1838 departure of the 
pioneer families was undertaken to avoid britains abolition of 
slavery to set up a free republic in an unpopulated land to bring 
christianity and civilization to african tribes or to steal the 
land of blacks and force them into subjugation 
stories about life on the trek battles and religious faith have 
taken on mythical proportions in the folklore of afrikaners the 
descendants of the pioneers who now dominate the government 
the 100th anniversary commemoration in 1938 united afrikaners 
gave impetus to their cultural and political organizations and 
propelled them to power in the nationalist party parliamentary 
victory 10 years later 
the rightwingers regard the gradual and limited reforms of 
apartheid now being made by todays nationalist government as a 
betrayal of white rights they hope this years celebration will be 
a catalyst leading to the ouster of the nationalists and victory for 
the conservative party and its allies 
a speech by president pw botha to crowds of picnickers at the 
pioneer monument will be broadcast live on national television 
the celebrations are the culmination of a fourmonth reenactment 
of the great trek by wagons and oxen that converged on pretoria this 
week 
twenty miles away in donkerhoek the opposition conservative 
party its supporters and rightwing groups such as the nazistyle 
afrikaner reform movement will be carrying on a more traditional 
celebration 
the rightwingers will dress in 19thcentury clothes listen to 
poetry and history readings and hold squaredances and singalongs 
the day of the vow dec 16 is considered a sacred national 
holiday 
it commemorates the 1838 battle at blood river in zululand when 
one of the pioneer groups vowed to keep the day forever holy if they 
won the battle against the zulu king dingaan the next morning they 
did 
most of south africas black majority of 26 million who have no 
vote in national affairs do not celebrate the holiday although 
they dont work on the day because the country virtually closes down 
a few blacks have participated in the governmentsponsored 
reenactment as oxen drivers but the rightwingers have no blacks 
in their festivities 
a coalition of antiapartheid groups said it would celebrate the 
day from the view of the losing side in the battle blacks 
celebrating what they call heroes day will meet in the tribal 
homeland of kangwane to pay homage to the chiefs who fought the 
whites in the 18th and 19th centuries

levetico diwa a 51yearold 
grandfather crawled through the brush with his rifle training to 
fight communists because he believes they routinely kill old and 
unproductive people 
diwa is one of 150000 volunteers the military hopes to recruit 
into a new militia it describes as essential to defeat communist 
rebels critics fear a new paramilitary will increase human rights 
abuses against civilians 
military plans call for the citizens armed forces geographical 
unit to consolidate under one banner hundreds of paramilitary and 
anticommunist vigilante groups to protect villages against the 
communist new peoples army this will help extend government 
control and curb rights abuses officials say 
in a report today the londonbased group amnesty international 
said legal safeguards are being ignored and that it has documented 
evidence of torture and illegal detentions by police soldiers and 
paramilitary forces 
human rights groups in the philippines and political commentators 
also question the wisdom of arming thousands more civilians 
the trend toward militarization makes people think the only way 
to contend with our problems is through a military solution said 
one prominent human rights activist mariss diokno we did not 
expect that the vigilante groups would be dismantled and be replaced 
by another group 
but officers training diwa and more than 80 other volunteers on 
the bataan peninsula 30 miles west of manila claim the new unit is 
different 
diwa and the other recruits are lectured on the human rights that 
are guaranteed by the constitution regular and noncommissioned 
officers will command the new units to ensure they follow 
regulations officials said 
like diwa most of the volunteers at the makeshift camp in liang 
were peasant farmers aged 18 to 55 diwa said in an interview that 
he joined because he believes that under communism if you are old 
and unproductive then they will kill you he said this notion has 
been reinforced by military officers lectures on the evils of 
communism 
at the camp trainees undergo a fiveweek crash course including 
weapons training basic infantry tactics selfdefense and first aid 
after graduating paramilitary troops move to villages where they 
live with the people defend them and gather information on rebels 
for the army they get 90 cents a day plus clothing medical care 
housing and firearms 
the army does not have sufficient manpower to ensure the 
security of every village col ramsey ocampo constabulary 
commander for bataan said in a recent interview regular troops 
will clear areas of rebels and the paramilitary will follow to 
maintain government control he said 
the government says rebels virtually control 7800 of the 
countrys 40832 villages it just depends on who gets there 
first said a communist political officer who spoke on condition 
of anonymity he said the paramilitary would be most effective in 
areas that have not been infiltrated 
fears about the new unit stem from the civilian home defense 
force a paramilitary force that was established by former president 
ferdinand marcos and that became notorious for rights abuses 
president corazon aquino who replaced marcos after a 
militarycivilian uprising promised to disband that force during 
her 1986 election campaign and now says it will be phased out as the 
new paramilitary unit is deployed 
but military officers admit privately that they often turn to 
paramilitary veterans to find enough recruits for the new unit 
abelardo torno a trainee in pampanga province said he has 
belonged to anticommunist militias since the 1960s including 17 
years in the home defense force all they did was change the 
name said an officer who stood nearby

dan quayle was so bored in the house of 
representatives that he missed committee meetings to play golf or 
work out earning the nickname of wet head because he was always 
coming out of the gym according to a new book on the vice 
presidentelect 
however the book by political scientist richard f fenno jr 
says quayle quickly matured when he moved to the senate in 1980 and 
risked alienating the republican administration to engineer passage 
of an important bipartisan job training bill 
the freshman republican senator was so irritated at roadblocks to 
the bill thrown up by labor department officials and thensecretary 
raymond donovan that he referred to them as the bastards the 
book says 
the making of a senator dan quayle is a sixyear study by 
fenno of quayles political career and his chief legislative 
accomplishment the job training partnership act of 1982 it is 
published by congressional quarterly 
quayles office said wednesday there would be no comment on the 
book 
the senator told the author he was very bored in the house 
where he served from 1976 to 1980 he missed meetings and votes and 
would sneak off to play golf or work out one unidentified 
associate is quoted as saying 
people called him wet head because he was always coming out 
of the house gym the associate said 
its an awful job especially being a republican there you 
cant get anything done quayle said 
but when he was elected to the senate in 1980 as republicans 
captured the majority there quayle was able to get a labor and 
human resources subcommittee chairmanship and drew the task of 
drafting legislation to replace the comprehensive employment and 
training act 
his work on the bill with edward kennedy of massachusetts the 
ranking democrat on the committee angered the administration which 
wanted to frame its own proposal although the quaylekennedy bill 
eventually prevailed tension between quayle and the labor 
department was such that the senator told the author they ought 
to be hung the bastards 
contrary to custom no members of congress were invited to the 
billsigning ceremony and when quayle later asked to have his 
picture taken with the president and to have his wife and children 
accompany him he was told that the senator could come to the white 
house unannounced through the side gate and with no family members

president reagan said today he would not 
hesitate to break off communications with the palestine 
liberation organization if it reneged on its declarations to 
renounce terrorism and accept israels right to exist 
reagan defended his decision to permit a dialogue between us 
officials and yasser arafats plo reversing a 12year us 
government policy telling reporters that words have been spoken 
that spelled out the plos acceptance of us conditions for direct 
talks 
the president also said that he didnt think israel had any 
reason to be upset by the us decision because we have made it 
very plain that we have not retreated one inch from our position of 
guaranteeing the safety of the jewish state 
the president talked to reporters twice during picturetaking 
sessions in the oval office with turkish prime minister turgut ozal 
and later with italian prime minister ciriaco de mita he spoke 
after us officials quickly followed through on the reversal of the 
longstanding policy against talks with the plo seeking an early 
meeting 
a senior state department official said he hoped that would lead 
to direct arabisraeli peace talks 
presidentelect george bush said today he supported the 
presidents decision he added 
i havent spelled out any hopes about it arafat met the 
conditions of the united states and we will go forward with a 
dialogue not negotiations but a dialogue lets see how things 
evolve 
as for the discussions he said theres no game plan theres 
no fivepoint program 
asked if he would prefer that the talks wait until his 
administration starts next month bush replied i am vice 
president of the united states i become president on jan 20 on 
jan 21 ill tell you what i want to do 
reagan said the administration made its move after it became 
satisfied that plo chairman yasser arafat in a news conference in 
geneva wednesday had complied with the american conditions for a 
dialogue with his organization 
asked today to explain the policy reversal reagan replied 
well because the words have been spoken and the words were the 
words that we have been stating were necessary 
but he quickly added that of course the words must be 
matched by performance and if theyre not why were back where we 
started asked a short time later what he would do if the plo 
failed to live up to its statements the president replied well 
wed certainly break off communications 
asked if such direct usplo contacts could achieve anything in 
view of opposition by the israeli government he said the ultimate 
solution does not depend on outsiders or us peace must be brought 
about by the involved nations meeting with each other and settling 
their differences 
asked why the united states does not recognize a palestinian 
state reagan said well because there is no such thing as of 
now there isnt a palestinian state and if you recognize someone 
as that it would be us declaring who was in charge there 
reagan said the move was just another step in what weve been 
trying for eight years to bring about peace in the middle east 
the us ambassador to tunisia robert h pelletreau jr who was 
assigned to open the historic substantive dialogue with the plo 
called the director general of the political section at the plos 
tunis headquarters to try to make arrangements for the talks a us 
official said 
while no date was set were sure the plo will try hard to have 
them take place as soon as possible said the official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
but right now the time the place and the level have not been 
set he said 
another us official said the session could be held as early as 
tomorrow and certainly within the next few days 
he said tunis was the logical site and he doubted that a senior 
plo official would participate at this stage 
so far as the topics the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said we have our agenda of things to talk to the plo 
about first among them is the issue of terrorism and how you get 
to peace negotiations 
on capitol hill 
sen george mitchell the newly elected senate majority leader 
welcomed the us move as a significant step toward advancing the 
peace process 
the maine senator said that arafats acceptance of israels right 
to exist and renouncement of terrorism were important statements 
but that in light of the plos record must be viewed with 
caution 
the current majority leader robert byrd dwva praised the 
decision to open a dialogue with the plo calling the organizations 
new position an opportunity that must be pushed forward despite 
the risks 
our commitment to israel is firm and unswerving he said in a 
written statement but it must be tempered by the realization that 
there are times when we must take those first tenuous steps toward 
peace 
house foreign affairs committee chairman dante fascell dfla 
sought to reassure israel saying that continued aid to israel the 
top recipient of us assistance is necessary both to calm israeli 
fears and as a clear signal to the plo and other parties that the 
united states is committed firmly to the independence of israel 
within secure borders 
the announcement wednesday night left israel in diplomatic 
isolation and came just a few hours after bush had taken a tough 
line against the plo declaring that it had not met us conditions 
for direct dealings 
but reagan and secretary of state george p shultz said that 
arafat in statements made in geneva about the same time that bush 
was speaking had met the us conditions for a substantive 
dialogue a form of diplomatic acceptance long sought by the 
palestinian group 
only a day earlier the state department had said arafat failed 
to meet the us conditions and less than three weeks ago shultz 
had accused the plo of terrorism and said arafat was an accessory 
to such terrorism 
shultz asked wednesday if he had changed his mind on that 
subject said the plo had issued a statement wednesday that was 
clear it was not encumbered 
he said arafats group had accepted un security council 
resolutions 242 and 338 recognized israels right to exist in peace 
and security and renounced terrorism 
as a result shultz said the united states is prepared for 
a substantive dialogue with plo representatives 
bush just a few hours earlier had demanded that the plo satisfy 
us demands 
i want a clear statement on renunciation of terror bush 
said i want a very clear unambiguous statement on the right of 
israel to exist as a state and i want a clear endorsement of 
security council resolution 242 
the un resolutions adopted in 1967 and 1973 affirm the right 
of all states in the middle east to live in peace israel is not 
specifically mentioned

lyndon larouches fraud conspiracy trial 
went to the jury today for a verdict on whether he schemed to cheat 
tax collectors and lenders who supported his controversial causes 
after final closing arguments by defense lawyers and a rebuttal 
by government prosecutors chief us district judge albert v bryan 
jr sent the case to the jury of eight women and four men who heard 
testimony during the 15day trial 
bryan said the jurors will deliberate saturday if necessary to 
reach a verdict 
larouche the 66yearold political maverick and perennial 
minorparty presidential candidate did not testify in his own 
defense 
defense lawyer michael reilly said larouche fundraisers 
solicited loans with good faith assurances that they would be 
repaid but assistant us attorney kent robinson said all the 
defendants knew the terms of the loans could not be honored 
robinson told the jurors in the governments rebuttal that 
supporters who loaned money to the larouche movement werent the 
lifeblood of this organization these supporters were bled dry 
the organization treated these people with cynicism and 
disregard because everyone knew that the larouche organization was 
a bankruptcy waiting to happen he said 
the result robinson said was an enormous crime a 30 
million crime 
bryan cautioned the jurors in his instructions that larouches 
political goals were irrelevant to the case and robinson insisted 
that the government was not trying to get at lyndon larouche or 
quiet a political movement 
larouches political movement embraces a number of unorthodox 
positions and relies heavily on conspiracy theories to explain world 
events it has alleged that figures such as henry kissinger and 
queen elizabeth participate in those conspiracies larouche backers 
also have advocated a quarantine for aids victims 
a halfdozen defense attorneys heaped abuse on the governments 
case against larouche and six associates as garbage and a 
rotting carcass during closing arguments tuesday 
but prosecutors said they had proved that the defendants had 
conspired to defraud larouche supporters by raising more than 30 
million in loans without any intention of repaying them 
in addition larouche is charged with conspiring to defraud the 
internal revenue service by having all his personal expenses paid by 
various corporations he controls and pretending he had no taxable 
income 
if convicted on all 13 counts against him larouche faces a 
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling 325 
million larouche and his aides deny any wrongdoing 
prosecutor john markham said the governments case had nothing to 
do with larouches political beliefs but focused on allegedly 
deceptive fundraising practices 
the ends however noble they may be do not justify lying to 
people to get their money markham declared 
he said larouches lenders were burned by a group of people who 
think they are better and can use the money better than anyone 
else 
but larouche attorney odin anderson of boston said the 
governments case was based on voodoo conspiracy charges that 
were vague and unfounded 
they dont want you to decide straightforward facts anderson 
told the jurors they want you to decide garbage 
anderson said the bad smell that sometimes wafted through the 
courtroom came from the rotting carcass of the governments case 
at one point the judge admonished defense lawyer brian gettings 
for shouting at the jury during an especially impassioned closing 
argument 
hunched over his arms flailing and his fingers waggling 
gettings branded as liars two crucial government witnesses 
both former employees of the larouche organization who he said 
were openly vehemently hostile to every defendant in this case 
gettings said the defendants had simply borrowed too much money 
and were unable to repay loans because of government harassment and 
media attacks that shrank their revenues 
larouche and his fundraisers werent trying to line their 
pockets like classic fraud defendants gettings said if you dont 
find greed its impossible to find fraud he said 
defense lawyer james clark said the larouche case wasnt about 
money but about a political movement with dedicated followers who 
want it to succeed and powerful enemies who want it to fail 
anderson claimed the fbi actually wrote the letter that an 
elderly connecticut woman sent to larouche demanding the return of 
her loan money anderson said the letter was an fbi entrapment 
attempt against larouche

supports president reagans decision to begin talks with the 
palestine liberation organization but he cautioned lets see how 
things evolve theres no game plan 
bush said wednesday that plo leader yasser arafat had made some 
movement in a speech tuesday but not enough to warrant direct 
dealings with the plo by the united states later however after 
administration officials went over new arafat comments on israel and 
the middle east reagan said the united states would enter into a 
substantive dialogue with the plo 
the conditions that the american government set out have been 
consistent steadfast and now mr arafat says that those conditions 
are met bush said today so we will observe we will watch and 
our ambassador in tunisia will begin a dialogue theres no game 
plan theres no fivepoint program 
asked if he preferred that the talks wait until he takes office 
next month bush replied i am vice president of the united 
states i become president on jan 20 on jan 21 ill tell you what 
i want to do 
i support the presidents decision lets see how things 
evolve my position remains the same i want to see direct talks 
between for example between king hussein of jordan and the 
israelis bush said 
one day earlier bush took another step in forming his new 
administration naming his choice for agriculture secretary he also 
said john tower could be an outstanding secretary of defense and he 
doubted that an fbi check had turned up anything to disqualify the 
former texas senator 
bush said he has not yet decided who will run the pentagon 
although sources said tower remained the leading candidate 
with eight more appointments to go bush hopes to complete naming 
his cabinet before christmas 
bush tapped clayton yeutter on wednesday as the sixth member of 
his cabinet yeutter the us trade representative for president 
reagan will be secretary of agriculture 
after three years in government yeutter had wanted to return to 
private business standing alongside bush at a news conference 
yeutter said there were only a few people in the world who could 
convince me to carry forward in another stint in government but 
youre one of those few 
bush also said he would name a black to his cabinet he has been 
urged by some black supporters to name louis w sullivan a black 
who is president of morehouse school of medicine as secretary of 
health and human services 
in addition the washington post reported in todays editions 
that another black julius w becton jr a retired threestar army 
general who heads the federal emergency management agency is the 
top contender to head the veterans administration and that a 
hispanic member of the federal communications commission patricia 
diaz dennis is a candidate to head the labor department 
also an aide to sen lowell p weicker jr who lost his 
reelection bid last month confirmed that the senator has met with 
bush about possibly taking over the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
covering a wide range of topics at the news conference bush also 
hinted his administration will seek a delay in februarys 
resumption of arms control talks with the soviet union there is 
no way that we are going to have by feb 15 or 16 a detailed 
pointbypoint program on arms talks bush said 
said vice presidentelect dan quayles role would be very much 
like the reaganbush relationship he said quayle would be a key 
player in national security affairs if he wants to be and that 
there may be specific assignments in other areas 
said he would not seek substantial cuts in existing farm 
programs but didnt say what he meant by substantial i do not 
believe we will balance the budget eventually on the backs of 
farmers he said 
yeutter 58 a onetime nebraska farmer was the fifth veteran of 
the reagan administration to join bushs incoming cabinet 
asked how yeutters selection squared with his promise to bring a 
new team of people to washington bush said well his face is 
familiar but the job is very different than being trade 
representative 
he promised anew to bring in some unfamiliar faces 
however tower is a familiar figure a onetime senator from texas 
who was an arms negotiator in geneva for reagan even before the end 
of the presidential campaign tower was at the top of bushs list to 
run the pentagon but his appointment has been delayed by an 
extensive background check of his dealings with defense contractors 
and aspects of his personal life

the supreme court today ruled against a quebec law 
forbidding languages other than french on commercial signs 
the courts unanimous 50 ruling allows quebec to order french on 
signs but cannot prevent other languages from being used as well 
quebecs premier robert bourassa is expected to announce his 
decision sunday on how the provincial government will comply with 
the ruling 
the language law was passed in 1977 when the separatist parti 
quebecois held power bourassas liberal party platform has 
supported multilingual signs 
the court found that the law requiring commercial signs only in 
french violated the guarantees of freedom of expression provided in 
the quebec charter 
constitutional lawyers interpreted the ruling as meaning that 
bourassa should be able to find some kind of compromise on the issue 
the judgment makes it consistent with civil liberties lawyer 
julius grey said in a live interview with the canadian broadcasting 
corp 
a majority of quebec residents speak french as a first language 
two separate cases by englishspeaking residents challenged the law

a black alderman dropped out of the race for mayor 
thursday warning of a return to machine politics unless blacks 
can agree upon a candidate to oppose the son of the late mayor 
richard j daley 
in announcing his withdrawal alderman danny davis predicted cook 
county states attorney richard m daley son of the legendary 
political boss would without a doubt win the april 4 mayors 
race unless either alderman timothy evans or mayor eugene sawyer 
both of whom are black drop out of the race 
davis gave his support to evans who was the leading black 
candidate in a recent newspaper poll 
daley is considered the frontrunner based on recent polls 
sawyer evans and daley square off in a feb 28 democratic primary 
a daley administration according to davis would be a 
reinstitution of what we call plantation politics in many areas of 
chicago feudal system politics where clout becomes the passport 
to city services clout becomes the passport to jobs clout becomes 
the passport to benefits 
david wilhelm daleys campaign manager called davis comments 
unfortunate and said theyre talking about the past our 
campaign is focused on the future 
sawyer elected mayor by the city council after the death last 
november of harold washington has raised more than 2 million for 
his campaign but davis said he never considered endorsing sawyer 
the evans support comes from the progressive the activist base 
group of the coalition that generated and sustained the washington 
era davis said so i would have a much greater feeling that 
machine influence would not play nearly as much of a role in an 
evans administration as it would in a sawyer administration 
a chicago tribune poll taken dec 25 of 1038 registered voters 
indicated that of 12 declared or potential candidates daley was the 
choice of 29 percent evans had 17 percent sawyer had 10 percent 
and jesse jackson who is not a candidate had 10 percent 
in that poll which had an error range of 3 percentage points 
davis received 3 percent of the votes 
winning the democratic primary generally has been tantamount to 
winning the general election in chicagos recent history that 
changed somewhat in 1983 when republican bernard epton made a strong 
showing in a losing effort against washington

police found the naked body of a 4yearold girl in 
a campground near tokyo on thursday the first confirmed death in a 
series of crimes against children that have traumatized the citys 
suburbs 
a 7yearold girl and another 4yearold remain missing in 
saitama prefecture west of tokyo in a series of disappearances that 
began in august 
six times since october children at play have been stabbed by 
strangers in saitama and in chiba prefecture east of the capital 
none of the stabbing victims ranging in age from 2 to 4 was 
fatally injured 
police said they are treating the incidents as cases of sexual 
perversion 
the stabbings and abductions of toddlers by unidentified stalkers 
have caused panic in the normally placid suburbs in a country that 
prides itself on a low crime rate the crimes also have attracted 
the nations attention 
i never thought a thing like this could happen here a 
housewife told the japan broadcasting corp the night before erika 
nambas naked body was found in a campground 20 miles from her home 
we moved here because we thought this would be a good place to 
raise children 
police searched the campground after officials there reported 
finding articles of clothing with erikas name on them 
in the middleclass developments where the missing girls lived 
hundreds of office workers and high school students have joined 
police in fruitless searches of playgrounds and nearby scrubland 
housewives have posted fliers bearing likenesses of the girls 
all of whom disappeared in the bustling neighborhoods in the 
afternoon hours after school let out and before darkness fell 
police helicopters and patrol cars have broadcast warnings urging 
children to get home before dark and school principals have 
admonished pupils to avoid strangers and see each other home 
but despite a combined turnout of almost 6000 police officers in 
chiba and a similar number in saitama police report no arrests and 
few leads 
on wednesday they released a drawing based on another childs 
description of a man seen with erika shortly before she 
disappeared it showed a face covered by sunglasses and a gauze mask 
little children dont have large vocabularies said koji 
tateishi an assistant inspector with the chiba prefectural police 
in the stabbings what happens to them happens in a flash they 
cant really tell us about it 
were treating these as cases of sexual perversion he said 
since erika was reported missing on friday and 3yearold sachiyo 
abe was stabbed in the stomach on a quiet street in chiba a day 
later coverage on nightly news programs and in nationwide 
newspapers has intensified to a level unseen since the kidnapmurder 
of a small boy in september 1987 
the country followed nightly news reports on the ordeal of 
5yearold yoshiaki ogiwara the reports described his abduction 
near his home anonymous calls demanding a 20 million yen ransom 
then 140000 from his fireman father and the discovery of the 
boys body in a ravine two days later 
outraged media commentators then spoke of the unraveling of 
japanese society and waning confidence in a formidable police force 
that boasted a 1987 record of arrests in 626 percent of all 
reported nontraffic crimes compared with 207 percent in the 
united states 
despite a perceived increase in crimes against children overall 
crime in japan actually declined 02 percent in 1987 
but in the chiba section where sachiyo abe was stabbed fear has 
curtailed lateafternoon activity at the neighborhood park 
housewife chisato shiba said 
she continues to take her 15monthold son outside to play but 
even more than before i make it a point to watch him very 
closely she said the thing is theres really no way to 
prevent these things

a man convicted of murdering his wife 33 
years ago will not get a pardon hearing even though another man 
confessed to the slaying before his death last summer the nebraska 
board of pardons ruled today 
attorney general robert spire one of three members of the board 
said darrel parker can explore other avenues but he declined to 
elaborate the ruling was unanimous 
spire said the board can consider parkers request for a pardon 
only if there is a clear miscarriage of justice the board 
spire said is not a court not a super appeals board 
parker 57 former parks supervisor in moline ill served 13 
years in prison for the 1955 murder of his wife nancy an appeals 
court overturned his conviction on the ground that police had 
coerced a confession but prosecutors did not retry him and he was 
paroled in 1969 
another convicted murderer wesley peery had meanwhile told his 
lawyers that he killed mrs parker giving them intimate details of 
the killing but made them promise not to reveal his confession 
until after his death 
the lawyers stanley cohen and toney redman came forward after 
peery 63 died of a heart attack on death row in july 
parkers lawyer richard bruckner said parker told him all he 
wanted is a piece of paper a complete pardon finally clearing my 
name bruckner did not attend todays board hearing and had no 
immediate comment on the ruling 
secretary of state allen beermann another member of the pardon 
board said parker could seek a new trial 
the pardon board which also includes gov kay orr was given a 
sealed transcript of peerys admission and considered parkers 
request for a pardon hearing a day after the 33rd anniversary of 
mrs parkers death 
peerys confession was among two years of taped and written 
interviews he gave to cohen and redman in the hope a book would be 
written about his exploits he boasted of killing 12 people over 
four decades

the government does not need evidence of drug 
abuse to justify random tests of federal officials with access to 
classified information the justice department told an appeals court 
thursday 
deterrence of drug use among officials in a position to 
compromise secrets is justification enough to randomly test them 
assistant attorney general john h bolton said 
the united states is permitted as an employer to make 
reasonable steps to prevent something from becoming a problem 
bolton said challenging a lower courts ban on random testing of 
4700 justice department officials 
there are enormous national security interests at stake here 
bolton told a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of 
appeals the lower courts ruling stopped the drugtesting program 
from being implemented last summer 
this is a case about protecting the integrity of those who 
represent the united states in court bolton said its a case 
about protecting national security safeguarding grand jury secrecy 
and preserving the efficacy of criminal prosecution 
the context is a fitnessforduty test by a public employer 
bolton said of the program that is being challenged by employees who 
obtained a permanent injunction barring the tests from us district 
judge george revercomb 
former maryland attorney general stephen h sachs urged the panel 
to uphold revercombs finding that testing without any suspicion of 
drug use by the individual is an unconstitutional invasion of 
privacy 
sachs said the appeals court was mandated to weigh and to 
balance the governments interest in testing with the individual 
employees constitutional rights to privacy 
in doing so the court must ask is there a demonstrable 
existence of a problem he said 
the justice department has failed to provide some kind of data 
that supports the reasonableness of the search and that is the 
core command of the fourth amendment said sachs who was once 
us attorney in baltimore 
the employees dont dispute the need to preserve the departments 
integrity or protect secrets sachs said the question is how may 
the department go about enforcing and imposing those accepted 
requirements 
the department has plenty of ways observation of supervisors 
background checks all the less intrusive ways to check up on its 
employees sachs said 
but bolton argued that the issue was not evidence of drug use but 
the types of secrets the employees handled 
justice department employees have access to some of the nations 
most closely held secrets such as information about 
counterintelligence and defense programs such as the stealth 
bomber 
stealth technology is something that the kgb would crawl over 
hot coals to get its hands on bolton said 
but his argument seemed to trouble chief judge patricia wald who 
questioned when those national security concerns would justify an 
intrusive search 
the strongest part of your case is the governments interest 
wald told bolton its the other side of the equation what can 
trigger this type of testing that bothers me the most 
theres no question we are living in a highrisk society the 
question is how far can we go in deterring large risks in terms 
of our constitutional rights wald said 
bolton argued that justice department employees already waived 
privacy rights when they submitted to extensive fbi background 
checks and medical examinations 
circuit judge laurence silberman taking up an argument advanced 
by bolton suggested that requiring evidence of drug use would mean 
the government would have to stop testing once it had successfully 
deterred narcotics abuse among a group of employees 
the implications of that argument are awful sachs said 
the government could suspend the constitution if deterrence 
were allowed to be the sole justification for drug testing he said 
both sides urged the court to decide the case without waiting for 
a ruling by the supreme court on two other cases involving drug 
testing the high court is reviewing testing of us customs service 
agents seeking promotion and railway crews involved in accidents 
circuit judge spottswood robinson iii also sat on the panel 
which gave no indication when it would rule

the judge in joel steinbergs murder trial will 
probably tell the jury that his livein lover was an accomplice in 
the death of the girl they raised a move that could undermine her 
testimony according to a source 
hedda nussbaums testimony is central to the case against 
steinberg who is accused in the 1987 fatal beating of 6yearold 
lisa steinberg 
the source who is involved in the case and spoke on the 
condition of anonymity said wednesday that state supreme court 
justice harold rothwax probably will tell the jury to consider ms 
nussbaum an accomplice 
depending on how the judge phrases the instruction it could mean 
the jury will not be permitted to use her testimony to convict 
steinberg unless there is corroborating evidence 
todays session was delayed however when rothwax was hit by a 
car and suffered two broken wrists as he rode his bike to court 
police said 
if rothwax tells the six men and six women to consider her an 
accomplice as a matter of fact he lets them decide whether her 
actions or inaction contributed to the childs death if the jurors 
decide she contributed to the death then her testimony must be 
supported by other evidence 
if the judge instructs them that ms nussbaum was an accomplice 
as a matter of law then the panel has no choice and is obliged 
to use ms nussbaums testimony only if it is supported by other 
evidence or testimony 
steinberg 47 is a disbarred lawyer charged in the death of the 
girl he illegally obtained at birth from an unwed teenager the 
girl was removed from his greenwich village apartment and died in a 
hospital three days later of a head injury 
steinberg has denied hitting the girl but ms nussbaum said 
steinberg told her the night lisa was fatally injured that he had 
knocked lisa down and she didnt want to get up 
ms nussbaum testified that steinberg then went to dinner with a 
friend she said that during the three hours that he was out she 
did nothing to help the child 
medical experts testified that lisa could probably have been 
saved if help had been summoned earlier 
ms nussbaum originally was charged with murder prosecutors 
dropped charges on the ground that she had been so beaten down 
physically and mentally by steinberg that she was unable to act ms 
nussbaum agreed to testify against steinberg 
ms nussbaum 46 a former editor of childrens books spent 
seven days on the witness stand recalling 12 brutal and bizarre 
years with steinberg

the chairman of the house committee on 
narcotics abuse and control said thursday that after a lengthy 
conversation with cuban president fidel castro he is convinced the 
possibility exists to establish a new era of cooperation in 
narcotics control 
rep charles rangel dny said his 3hour meeting with castro 
in havana on tuesday evening was extremely promising 
there is now the possibility of discussions towards 
establishing direct cubaus cooperation in narcotics 
interdiction as well as extending cooperation into other areas 
such as eemergency search and rescue operations rangel said 
it is time to depoliticize narcotics efforts with cuba 
rangel said he said the meeting with castro signals the possibility 
of opening a new era of cooperation in narcotics control 
rangel commented in a statement issued by his office here he and 
others in a 12member congressional delegation are touring latin 
america with visits scheduled to the dominican republic guyana 
trinidad and tobago 
rangel said castro told the delegation that cuba wants to work 
with the united states and latin american countries and that 
cooperation with the united states will naturally flow from this 
involvement 
castro said he recognizes that the problem is shared by the 
region and it needs to be addressed regionally rangel said 
currently there is no cooperation officially or unofficially 
between marxist cuba and the united states on narcotics matters 
rangel said he had been told by state department and drug 
enforcement administration officials that cuban and us law 
enforcement agencies do not even share information on suspected 
upcoming drug shipments 
this kind of nutsandbolts joint interdiction cooperation is 
an example of what can be started right away he said

the american decision to talk with the plo 
is the biggest step toward middle east peace in a decade but 
radical palestinians called yasser arafat a traitor thursday and 
said the bloodshed will continue 
arafats renunciation of terrorism and recognition of israels 
right to exist coupled with the us response after years of 
shunning the palestine liberation organization is the most dramatic 
development since egypt signed a peace treaty with israel in 1979 
his move could be the turning point in the 40 years of 
arabisraeli conflict but it also is the plo chairmans greatest 
gamble and could explode in his face 
such radical palestinian factions as the abu nidal group may 
launch a new wave of terrorism intended to wreck the initiative 
militants within the plo have stayed their hands for the moment but 
many feel arafat made too many concessions 
the popular front for liberation of palestine a marxist group 
that reconciled with arafat last year after a fouryear 
estrangement accused him of capitulation 
its leader george habash said in a statement sent to the 
associated press in nicosia from damascus syria that it welcomed 
the us decision but felt washington acted only to end the 
diplomatic isolation that followed its refusal to grant chairman 
yasser arafat a visa to go to new york 
therefore we urge our masses to keep up the struggle to force 
israel and the united states to recognize the state of palestine and 
all legitimate palestinin rights he said 
after the united states refused arafat a visa to address the un 
general assembly in new york the assembly moved its session to 
geneva 
saeed mousa who leads a syrianbased breakaway faction called 
fatahuprising said arafat was a traitor for his surrenderist 
concessions to the united states and the israeli enemy 
a mousa spokesman accused the plo chairman later of paying an 
exhorbitant price the recognition of israel for this american 
decision and declared arafat is not able to fulfill his 
commitments especially his commitment to give up the armed struggle 
against israel 
mousa and other dissidents left the plo in 1983 in a 
syriansupported mutiny 
ahmed jibril of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command also backed by syria said in damascus 
arafat has recognized israel and offered fourfifths of the 
palestinian land to the jewish state 
by renouncing violence and terrorism arafat is condemning 
anyone who uses the gun against the israeli occupier jibril said 
arafat has offered israel what he doesnt have the land of 
palestine is not the property of any organization or any 
individual 
six weeks ago west german authorities arrested 13 people 
suspected of belonging to jibrils group who said they were planning 
terrorist attacks 
the extremist saiqa faction whose name in arabic means 
lightning said in damascus we shall see to it that the plo 
gets back on its original revolutionary course of struggle 
arafat and his lieutenants would be targets of the radicals 
along with israelis and americans 
since his first hints at moderation 15 years ago arafat has had 
to fight not only the israelis but palestinian extremists and 
hardline arab nations led by syria hafez assad president of 
syria has sought for years to gain control of the plo 
gunmen working for abu nidal have killed a score of arafat aides 
and the israeli secret service has assassinated others the last 
victim of israel was khalil alwazir the plo chairmans righthand 
man shot to death april 16 at his home in tunis according to 
israeli security sources 
last month arafat steered the plo legislature to implicitly 
recognizing israel by accepting un security council resolutions 
242 and 338 as the basis of an international middle east peace 
conference 
the palestine national council also declared an independent 
state presumably to be located in the west bank and gaza strip 
where palestinians have been in revolt against israeli occupation 
for a year 
habashs guerrilla group and others went along with the 
compromise at the algiers meeting for the sake of unity but habash 
said to arafat 
were backing your efforts because this is what the majority 
wants but we dont believe moderation will pay we cant wait 
forever if you fail you have to come back to this council to say 
so and we can then decide the future course

the city council has unanimously approved an 
ordinance banning beepers in all public and private schools a move 
educators hope will put a dent in drug sales and prostitution 
we know their mothers are not beeping them alderman robert 
shaw said earlier at a committee meeting 
school officials say students are often beeped in classrooms to 
make drug deals or to engage in prostitution 
weve got girls 11 years old they get a call and theyre out 
of school to turn a trick public schools security chief george 
sims said 
the beeper ban was part of an omnibus ordinance approved by 
aldermen wednesday 
school superintendent manford byrd issued an executive order in 
september banning the beepers but sims said the result was irate 
parents who didnt like being called down to school because of the 
infraction 
the ordinance takes the issue out of the hands of school 
administrators and gives it to the police violators are subject to 
fines of 200 to 500

a city ordinance requiring handgun purchasers 
to wait 15 days before picking up their weapons goes into effect 
friday 
the law requires the wait between sale and receipt of a handgun 
to allow police time to check whether the prospective buyer has a 
criminal record or is mentally incompetent 
until now guns could be picked up immediately and police had to 
track the buyers down if there were reasons to prevent them from 
buying guns cincinnatis ordinance is based on an ohio law that 
allows cities to enact local gun control measures 
the national rifle association which lobbied against the 
ordinance said cincinnatis law goes farther than measures in other 
cities because it applies to individuals who sell guns as well as 
to commercial gun dealers 
the law requires anyone selling renting leasing or transferring 
ownership or possession of a handgun to notify police of the 
transaction and fill out an application form forms are available at 
police district stations and the city safety department offices 
the ordinance does not cover rifles or shotguns 
violation is a firstdegree misdemeanor with a maximum 1000 
fine and six months in jail 
three stores in cincinnati now sell handguns retailers say it is 
too soon to tell what impact the ordinance will have on sales

fifteen of chicagos best and brightest high 
school seniors are being enticed into the teaching profession in a 
corporatesponsored scholarship program 
the 15 students introduced wednesday as academy of educators 
scholars will receive a free fouryear education if they graduate 
from college and teach for at least five years and if they land a 
classroom job in chicago the students will receive a 12000 bonus 
all my friends are aspiring lawyers and aspiring physicians 
and all of them want to make a lot of money said afrika turner 
17 i never wanted to be a nurse or a firewoman i always wanted 
to be a teacher 
the program offered by the foundation for excellence in teaching 
is being financed by kraft inc arthur andersen amp co gatx corp 
and a number of individuals 
martin koldyke who helped start the foundation said the program 
is an investment in the citys youth 
in the venture capital business you have to project for the 
future and this is the future said koldyke general partner 
of frontenac co a venture capital firm 
the program and others like it have the support of the 
680000member american federation of teachers which has lobbied 
congress for a similar federal program said spokesman scott 
treibitz in washington 
having goverment do it is really the norm i think what is a 
little out of the ordinary is having the corporation underwrite this 
and i think you will see more and more of that down the line 
treibitz said 
he added corporations are begining to realize that they have a 
lot at stake and they need to improve the schools 
koldyke said 30 teachers who were winners of the foundations 
golden apple awards evaluated the files of 190 promising seniors 
nominated by the citys public and private high schools 
the 15 winners can attend one of four schools northwestern 
university depaul university university of illinoischicago or the 
national college of education 
marvin lynn 17 said he jumped at the chance for a scholarship 
i want to be a music educator teach high school students to 
sing classical music and some gospel lynn said i think i might 
have afforded college without this but i would have been in debt 
for a long time 
for koldyke who taught for a year in chicago in 1965 supplying 
gifted teachers to the city schools has an element of personal 
satisfaction 
i wasnt a very good teacher he said and i came to 
realize that it was an extremely tough profession

the governors mansion shake the chief executives hand and sip 
warm cider 
gov steve cowper and his wife michael played host at the 
christmas open house wednesday night for the third consecutive year 
in the colonial mansion overlooking the state capital 
except for two years during world war ii the open house has been 
an annual event since the imposing threestory home was built for 
territorial gov walter clark in 1912 
ive been to about 38 of them out of the 40 years ive been 
here said 92yearold ethel m montgomery this is my house and 
i love it 
the feeling that the house is a state treasure that belongs to 
all alaskans brings them out in every shape age and occupation 
you wouldnt be able to get away with it in a place with more 
population said koren bosworth one of juneaus 30000 residents 
its nice it gives people a feeling theyre part of it 
guests mingled about the main floor of the 15room mansion 
carrying plates of food and cups of cider or punch while the 
cowpers and lt gov stephen mcalpine and his wife greeted people 
the upstairs living quarters and the basement were off limits 
in the living room guests were entertained by violinists and a 
chorus while children lined up to talk to santa and mrs claus 
sandy fiscus who was sampling the refreshments with her

a mail handler shot three coworkers in the 
main new orleans post office then holed up inside for 13 hours with 
his girlfriend as a hostage firing birdshot at random from under a 
door today authorities said 
warren murphy threw out his shotgun and surrendered this morning 
after allnight telephone negotiations with fbi and police 
including a cousin who is a police officer his girlfriend appeared 
unhurt said fbi spokeswoman nancy fisher 
the rampage was prompted by murphys concern for the welfare of 
his two children in his wifes custody in washington said police 
superintendent warren woodfork who got him to surrender i just 
tried to appeal to him as a father woodfork said 
none of the three coworkers hit by birdshot from murphys gun 
suffered lifethreatening wounds hospital officials said one 
person was shot in the eye 
murphy who is about 40 was a sixyear mail handler who had 
recently been promoted but whose wife had left him post office 
spokesman cesta ayers said 
he feels like he doesnt like the conditions which they his 
children are living under and i assured him that i would look into 
that woodfork said and if his kids are being neglected i 
would do all i could to try to get some intervention to maybe get 
the kids back here in the custody of their grandmother 
woodfork said murphy wasnt angry at his girlfriend and 
coworker carol smith 29 after the shooting started he just 
grabbed her the police superintendent said 
murphy made only one demand during the siege telling negotiators 
he didnt want to see any reporters police moved all reporters and 
photographers off the sidewalk to a parking garage across the street 
murphy came to work wednesday night and got into some sort of 
argument with a coworker and pulled a weapon out of a bag he had 
secured in the area said volney hayes spokesman for the fbi in 
an adjacent building 
the 830 pm shootings chased about 400 workers from the 
building which takes up most of a city block across the street from 
the superdome about 100 workers took cover and hid in the building 
for four hours before being escorted out by officers making a 
roombyroom search for the gunman 
murphy chased off fbi agents with gunfire when they cornered him 
in a room used for coffee breaks hayes said during the night 
murphy apparently became frustrated and fired about 10 more shots 
hayes said no one was hurt 
they were just random shots hayes said they havent been 
at anyone just stick the barrel under the door and fire 
gunfire hit the telephone officers and relatives had used to try 
to talk murphy into surrendering another phone was tossed to him 
hayes said he thought murphys shotgun had been brought in 
earlier but he gave no further details except to say two shots were 
fired and one of the wounded was the person murphy argued with he 
did not identify the victims 
two people one hit in a thigh and the other in an arm were in 
stable condition at area hospitals officials said a third person 
was wounded in the eye and underwent surgery at charity hospital 
when the shooting began pat wingerter of new orleans was 
standing in line with his christmas cards 
i was going to mail this box of stuff i have and the security 
guard came down he was real excited wingerter said the guard 
was screaming theres a guy with a gun 
wingerter said the security guard ran to the door to make sure 
the half dozen or so postal workers and customers escaped 
i heard one shot and then the people started coming out he 
said even after the shot there were people driving up mailing 
letters for about five minutes it was crazy 
the new orleans post office was the scene of another shooting in 
1980 when postal worker curtis collins burst in and killed his 
35yearold supervisor with a 30caliber carbine 
on aug 20 1986 parttime mailman patrick henry sherrill walked

the plo once a ragtag army of militants 
pursuing the quixotic aim of crushing israel has evolved into a 
palestinian governmentinwaiting embracing a wide range of 
ideologies 
but the unity is fragile 
the nine guerrilla factions and other political groups which 
constitute the 23yearold movement are held together by their 
palestinian nationalism they are prey to the divisive and violent 
currents of arab politics 
they range from the marxist guerrillas of george habashs popular 
front for the liberation of palestine which endorsed arafats 
strategy of moderation with some reluctance to islamic 
fundamentalists 
the outcome of the talks will be crucial for arafats strategy of 
moderation 
that depends to a large degree on him holding the radical 
elements of his disparate organization in check long enough to 
attain solid political gains not just from the united states but 
from israel 
the plo represents a widely divergent constituency in the 55 
million strong palestinian diaspora from poor peasants eking a 
living on the scrubland of the israelioccupied west bank to 
intellectuals in western capitals 
some like habash are greek orthodox christians most like plo 
chairman yasser arafat are moslems 
the plo is more than just a military organization dedicated to 
regaining the palestinian homeland lost in 1948 arafat 59 has 
built it into an institution that provides social educational and 
medical services that are more effective than those run by some arab 
governments 
naseer aruri professor of political science at southeastern 
massachussetts university noted recently that this infrastructure 
was the real target of israels 1982 invasion of lebanon which 
was aimed at crushing the plo 
the plo guerrilla factions retain considerable autonomy and are 
often backed by different arab countries such as syria libya 
algeria and iraq who have frequently sought to manipulate the plo 
since arafat became chairman 19 years ago the plo has often been 
wracked by schisms to hold the movement together he has had to 
constantly compromise often when a decisive move could have meant a 
breakthrough in his efforts to make political gains 
his success in steering the palestine national council the plos 
parliamentinexile and its highest decisionmaking body to endorse 
recognition of israel and renounce terrorism was largely due the 
yearold palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza 
the uprising gave the palestinian struggle a crucial political 
dimension the revolt arose from frustration at the plos failure to 
achieve political advances and was the catalyst that helped swing 
things arafats way 
the plo has not announced who will talk with us officials but 
the palestinian negotiators will be the pointmen for arafat habash 
62 a charismatic physician and nayef hawatmeh 57 leader of the 
democratic front for the liberation of palestine 
these three often meet behind closed doors before convening the 
plos ruling 15man executive committee to formulate policy 
another key figure will be farouk kadoumi head of the plos 
political department and its de facto foreign minister since 
1973 
khaled hassan and his younger brother hani have been close 
arafat advisers for years both are members of arafats fatah 
faction the largest group in the plo and often act as his 
emissaries to arab and european governments 
bassam abu sharif is another important figure who will be closely 
involved behind the scenes with a us team led by robert h 
pelletreau jr americas ambassador to tunisia

foreign relief workers said thursday they 
were giving up hope of finding more survivors of the armenian 
earthquake and crews prepared to evacuate the last residents of 
this hardhit town and raze it 
nouradian norig kritkorianizh the first secretary of spitaks 
communist party said in an interview that crews would take measures 
to prevent infectious diseases and begin razing the city on sunday 
about 15000 of spitaks 25000 people died in the dec 7 quake 
that destroyed most of city he said 
altogether the quake killed 55000 people in soviet armenia and 
left 500000 of the areas 700000 people homeless 
foreign relief experts and soviet officials said hope was fading 
to find more survivors and the tass news agency said searchers had 
found only one person alive in the past 24 hours that person was 
found in spitak it said 
voices and other signs of life in the ruins of destroyed cities 
dropped off sharply after monday night when temperatures plummeted 
to below freezing julia taft director of the us foreign disaster 
assistance office said at a moscow news conference 
the hope of finding any more survivors is ended she said 
green military vans with mounted speakers toured the muddy 
streets asking people to leave most women and children already were 
gone 
we believe the evacuation will take about three days 
kritkorianizh said about 5000 men needed to begin rebuilding the 
city in early spring will be given temporary housing about one mile 
from spitak he said 
trucks were distributing milk bread sausages meat and oranges 
to the survivors in spitak where it remained cold and damp 
some people had set up what was left of their household 
belongings upholstered chairs mattresses and even an occassional 
brass bed around crackling bonfires where it was warmer than 
inside tents 
a large group of people were pressing against the gates of what 
was once the citys central market where soldiers were distributing 
warm coats 
soviet officials vowed to continue the search until there is no 
more hope of bringing people out alive but said no more doctors or 
fire brigades are needed 
yesterday wednesday health minister yevgenvy chazov said the 
search was to continue but that with the lapse of time hopes grow 
smaller and smaller they are still looking for people in the 
ruins foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said at a 
news briefing 
teams from france and britain have already returned home willie 
mcmartin head of the 14member international rescue corps from 
britain said he doubted anybody was still alive if i thought 
there was someone still alive i would not be sitting here 
mcmartin told reporters at londons heathrow airport 
mcmartin said his group was physically exhausted and that the 
soviets were beginning to employ bulldozers making it difficult for 
them to use their high technology equipment to find victims 
rows of bulldozers were seen parked a few blocks from the main 
square in leninakan armenias secondlargest city located to the 
west of spitak 
george reid spokesman for the league of red cross and red 
crescent societies said the soviets had decided to call off the 
search and rescue on dec 20 and that some of the foreign relief 
teams were leaving 
it is a terrible dilemna for authorities caught between the 
need for proper sanitation and the need to respect relatives who are 
still hanging on he told the associated press 
he said that 25000 bodies had been counted based on figures 
provided to the red cross by the soviet council of ministers tass 
reported wednesday that 21755 bodies had been identified and 
counted so far 
thousands of corpses remained buried in rubble 
there is a danger of typhoid cholera and dysentery from the 
poor sanitation in the disaster area which has likely led to 
contamination of the water supply by insects and rodents dr jan 
borg of the netherlands red cross said in an interview in yerevan 
reporters visitng leninakan on thursday saw hundreds of sacks of 
lime piled at a hospital apparently in preparation for spreading on 
corpses 
while the relief teams were pulling out looters were moving in 
police have detained 179 people accused of stealing foreign 
relief packages and looting in the last 24 hours tass said 
monstrous as it sounds there are also others better 
described as shadows rather than as human beings they roam 
around the ruins not looking anybody in the face they roam around 
the ruins not to save but to steal armenias deputy interior 
minister viktor erin told tass

the un general assembly passed a resolution 
thursday with only the united states and israel opposed calling 
for an international middle east peace conference and un 
supervision of israelioccupied arab lands 
it acted at the end of a threeday debate on palestinian 
questions which was moved from new york to geneva after the united 
states denied plo chairman yasser arafat a visa the vote was 1382 
with canada and costa rica abstaining and iran not participating 
libya and syria voted yes with reservations declaring they did 
not recognize israel which was mentioned in the resolution 
an international conference should be convened under un 
auspices with the participation of all parties to the conflict 
including the palestine liberation organization on an equal 
footing the resolution said and the security council should 
establish a preparatory committee 
ambassador vernon a walters had said in the debate wednesday 
that the united states would oppose such a resolution 
an international conference may be useful insofar as it helps 
to launch and support direct negotiations but a conference must not 
preempt or substitute for the direct negotiations between israel 
and the palestinians and arab nations walters said 
the resolution affirms that one principle for achieving peace 
is the withdrawal of israel from the palestinian territory 
occupied since 1967 including jerusalem and the other occupied 
arab territories 
it notes the expressed desire and endeavors to place the 
palestinian territory occupied since 1967 including jerusalem 
under the supervision of the united nations for a limited period as 
part of the peace process 
an uprising against israeli rule began dec 8 1987 among the 
15 million palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
thirteen israelis and more than 320 palestinians have been killed 
a separate resolution passed thursday acknowledges the 
proclamation of the state of palestine by the palestine national 
council which acts as the plo legislature nov 15 in algiers 
it says the designation palestine liberation organization 
will be changed to palestine in the un system but the change 
would not constitute un recognition of a palestinian state the 
plo has observer status at the united nations and is invited to 
participate in middle east debates 
israel and the united states also opposed the second resolution 
which passed 1042 with 36 abstentions 
joseph petrone us ambassador to the united nations in geneva 
told the assembly the resolutions are unhelpful and inconsistent 
with the search for peace in a statement explaining the us 
vote petrone described un supervision in the occupied territories 
as impractical and unrealistic 
he said changing the un reference from plo to palestine is 
vague and could be susceptible to various interpretations we cannot 
support attempts to lend even a degree of purported legitimacy to 
the selfproclaimed palestinian state 
petrone repeated the statement washington made wednesday that the 
plo had met us conditions for direct contacts explicit acceptance 
of security council resolutions 242 and 338 calling for israeli 
withdrawal from occupied land and secure borders for all middle east 
states recognizing israels right to exist and renouncing 
terrorism 
we view this as another step forward toward the direct 
negotiations between the parties concerned that are essential to 
achieving a comprehensive settlement he said 
javier perez de cuellar un secretarygeneral said the us 
policy change was excellent news and created much more 
favorable conditions for an international peace conference 
including the plo 
vladimir petrovsky the soviet deputy foreign minister said it 
was a reasonable action going in the right direction but added 
it is not enough today to maintain just dialogue for the sake of 
dialogue 
un spokesman francois giuliani said perez de cuellar would 
return to new york on friday for consultations intended to speed the 
peace process 
these nations abstained on the second resolution antigua and

the mail fraud conspiracy trial of political 
maverick lyndon larouche and six associates went to a federal jury 
thursday with defense lawyers proclaiming their innocence and 
government prosecutors charging they had committed an enormous 
crime a 30 million crime 
after explaining the legal complexities for nearly an hour chief 
us district judge albert v bryan jr sent the case to the jury of 
eight women and four men at midday as christmas carols chimed from 
a church tower outside the courtroom 
bryan had said the jurors would deliberate through saturday if 
necessary to reach a verdict in the case involving larouche 66 
head of a controversial political movement and a perennial 
independent presidential candidate 
larouche did not testify in his own defense during the 15day 
trial but bryan cautioned jurors not to let that influence their 
decision 
the judge also said larouches political views were irrelevant to 
the case and assistant us attorney kent robinson denied defense 
lawyers suggestions that the government was trying to get at mr 
larouche or quiet a political movement 
larouche and six of his fundraisers and other aides are charged 
with mail fraud and conspiracy in an alleged scheme to raise more 
than 30 million in loans from supporters without any intention of 
repaying them 
in addition larouche is accused of conspiring to defraud the 
internal revenue service by having all his personal expenses 
housing meals clothing travel and even haircuts paid by various 
corporations he controls and claiming he had no taxable income 
larouche has not filed federal income tax returns for any year 
since 1978 government prosecutors said his lawyers contended he 
had received nontaxable compensation as an employee of his 
organization 
if convicted of all 13 counts against him larouche faces a 
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling 325 
million 
in the final closing defense argument attorney michael reilly 
said his client fundraiser paul greenberg and his colleagues 
solicited loans with goodfaith assurances that they would be repaid 
as promised 
waving his arm at each of the seven defendants reilly told the 
jurors they are not guilty and i ask you to say so 
in his rebuttal robinson said larouche and his associates knew 
their organization was in such dire financial straits that it was 
a bankruptcy waiting to happen but that they never warned 
prospective lenders they probably wouldnt get their money back 
defense lawyers asked the jurors to question why larouche 
fundraisers would cut off their life blood by defrauding loyal 
supporters to this robinson responded that they werent the life 
blood of this organization these supporters were being bled dry 
robinson accused the larouche people of treating their lenders 
with cynicism and disregard an attitude he said resulted in 
an enormous crime a 30 million crime 
he said there was only one issue to decide did the defendants 
tell the truth when they tried to borrow money from people did 
they tell the truth or did they lie 
bryan reminded the jurors that membership in a political 
organization even one with honest albeit controversial views 
is lawful under the constitution and is not evidence of any criminal 
activity 
larouches political movement embraces a number of unorthodox 
positions and relies heavily on conspiracy theories to explain 
world events it has alleged that prominent figures suchy as former 
secretary of state henry kissinger and britains queen elizabeth 
participate in those conspiracies 
some larouche supporters also have advocated a quarantine for 
aids victims and have been accused of harboring antisemitic views

portauprince haiti ap several soldiers who joined a 
rankandfile rebellion that brought lt gen prosper avril to power 
three months ago have been discharged for insubordination an army 
official said thursday 
we cannot let anarchy reign over the armed forces of haiti 
col joseph l florestant secretary general of the military staff 
told the associated press in a telephone interview 
in another development the salesian roman catholic order said in 
rome that it has expelled a haitian activist priest it accused of 
instigating violence and exalting class warfare the rev jean 
bertrand aristide was the apparent target of a september attack on a 
church that killed 13 people 
independent radio haiti inter said thursday that over the weekend 
several soldiers were discharged in the southern town of les cayes 
nine each from garrisons in the northern towns of st marc and 
gonaives and four in the southwestern town of aquin 
the station said all the ousted soldiers supported the sept 17 
coup against former leader lt gen henri namphy and the nationwide 
purge of unpopular officers that followed it 
florestant said the soldiers were not discharged because of their 
support for the september mutiny but because of their 
insubordination after the coup 
we cannot accept that orders come from the bottom of the 
hierarchy florestant said if an enlisted man had been stirred 
up and no longer wants to obey orders thinking he has become a 
political figure he may be sanctioned in conformity with the 
regulations of the army 
florestant who was himself appointed to his post after the coup 
said the discharge orders were issued by regional commanders and not 
the army high command in portauprince 
soldiers said they ousted namphy because they were disgusted by 
statesponsored violence they ousted nearly 60 officers accused of 
being repressive and linked to the former duvalier family 
dictatorship 
their demands included a return to democratic rule respect for 
human rights and better living conditions for haitis 7000man army 
namphy came to power after former president jeanclaude duvalier 
fled to exile in france in february 1986 ending 29 years of famly 
dictatorship 
aristide 35 has led calls for uprooting the vestiges of the 
duvalier regime in september he was escaped during a bloody attack 
on his church in portauprince during a sunday mass by thugs linked 
to the ousted regime thirteen people were killed and more than 70 
were wounded 
a communique issued in rome by the salesian society of st john 
bosco said aristide had rebuffed repeated attempts to correct his 
behavior which they described as in contrast with his salesian 
and priestly vocation 
the type of political commitment he has assumed is in serious 
contrast with the clear will of the founder of the order the 
statement said 
in addition the incitement to hate and violence the 
exaltation of class struggle go directly against that fidelity to 
the teaching of the church that forms a living part of the 
salesian spirit 
aristide has been at odds with superiors of his salesian order in 
rome for some time he was ordered to leave his homeland and go to 
canada by oct 17 but he defied the order and remains in haiti 
the orders spokesman the rev giuseppe costa said the decree 
ratified by the vatican last week did not change aristides status 
as a priest

film censors in their first open meeting ever 
approved a controversial movie about a young man who cannot cope 
with chinas new competition and commits suicide an official paper 
said thursday 
the censors decided that the movie tentatively titled 
transmigration can be released uncut to chinese theaters the 
guangming daily said 
the movie is directed by huang jianxin and produced by the xian 
film studio which in recent years has produced chinas most 
technically innovative and politically daring films 
huangs first feature movie the black cannon incident in 
1985 was cut by censors but still caused an uproar with its attack 
on mindless bureaucracy it told the story of a telegraphed message 
about a missing chess piece that was misinterpreted by officials as 
a message about a real cannon 
the guangming daily said censors in the ministry of radio film 
and television discussed huangs new movie in a twohour session 
that was open to journalists for the first time it did not say if 
the censors plan to make all their meetings open 
few chinese films have dealt with the impact on ordinary lives of 
the economic reforms of the past decade in which central planning 
and social welfare guarantees have been reduced in favor of the free 
market 
although the incomes of most chinese have risen dramatically 
some have actually slid and many people are unable or unwilling to 
obtain jobs or promotions based on merit 
by showing the underside of the new competition in which some 
cant keep up huangs movie could be seen as an indirect attack on 
government policy but he said in an interview earlier this year 
that this was not his intent 
the 34yearold director said his goal was not to provoke 
controversy but to make films that reflect social problems so 
they can be corrected 
the guangming daily said the censors decided that the movie is 
an authentic and honest attempt to portray the reactions of young 
people to the reform era in china and has artistic appeal 
for decades censors met privately and without objective 
guidelines to rule on the acceptability of movies and other 
entertainment the ministry of culture is drafting a law that would 
establish rules for what is permissible 
although this would reduce the power of individual censors some 
artists have expressed fears the law will halt the current process 
of gradual experimentation and liberalization

cbs inc new owner of wcixtv wants the federal 
communications commission to take a high school radio station off 
the air saying the stations signal interferes with the television 
stations audio transmission 
in papers filed tuesday with the agency cbs asked that wkpx 
piper high schools 3000watt progressive rock station be denied a 
permanent license 
wkpx has operated under a construction permit since it went on 
the air in february 1983 wcix filed a protest shortly afterward 
steve salo a student in pipers evening radio class said those 
involved in the station see this as the big guy coming down on the 
little guy 
and the little guy in this case is providing education to 
kids promoting the arts promoting local groups salo said 
but allen shacklan vice president for programming for cbs 
television stations said wkpx shouldnt have been allowed to 
broadcast on its frequency in the first place 
it looks like the fcc made a terrible mistake in ever granting 
that permit he said 
at that time shacklan said the fcc was in the midst of a 
proceeding that would prohibit radio stations at the low end of the 
fm band in areas where they conflict with television audio 
transmissions 
he said cbs has offered a proposal to wkpx that would allow it to 
stay on the air but would not discuss details wkpx officials 
wouldnt talk about it either but said it was unacceptable 
cbs takes control of wcix on jan 3 no date has been set for an 
fcc decision

in a decision that could revive tensions between 
french and english speakers in quebec the supreme court of canada 
ruled thursday against a provincial law requiring commercial signs 
to be written in french 
the courts 50 ruling says quebec can order french on signs but 
cannot prevent other languages being used as well 
quebec premier robert bourassa was expected to announce sunday 
how the provincial government will comply with the ruling 
the language law known as bill 101 was passed in 1977 when the 
separatist parti quebecois held power bourassas liberal party 
platform has supported multilingual signs 
the ottawa court ruling found section 58 of the law requiring 
commercial signs to be written only in french violated guarantees of 
freedom of expression provided in the quebec charter but it said 
the quebec governments goal of providing a french linguistic 
face for the province is valid 
constitutional lawyers interpreted the ruling as meaning bourassa 
should be able to find a compromise 
the judgment makes it consistent with civil liberties lawyer 
julius grey said in a television interview with canadian 
broadcasting corp 
power in quebec shifted from the english minority to the 81 
percent french majority during the 1970s a tumultuous decade of 
separatist sentiment that subsided when voters rejected a 
sovereignty referendum in 1980 
since then quebecers have focused on improved living standards 
and competitiveness 
the province boasted 5 percent real growth last year and produced 
40 percent of canadas business administration students it was a 
support base for the free trade agreement with the united states 
signed by prime minister brian mulroney and president reagan last 
january 
the court rulings stemmed from two separate cases one involving 
five companies that used bilingual signs and the other from allan 
singer a montreal stationer who insisted he had the right to use 
signs written only in english 
its not a good decision for us singer told reporters in 
montreal we wanted the english language in quebec and in canada 
and weve been denied it 
morton brownstein whose chain of shoe stores is one of five 
businesses in the other case told cbc television that all depends 
on what steps the provincial government takes i think everybodys 
looking for a compatible solution to this dilemma he said 
the most ardent supporters of frenchonly legislation want 
bourassa to invoke a clause that could override the supreme court 
ruling yet englishspeaking ministers in his government are 
expected to resign unless he acts to comply with it

anabolic steroids the substances taken to help 
build muscle are manmade versions of a male sex hormone called 
testosterone 
in children and teenagers steroids can make bones stop growing 
prematurely and prevent a child from reaching normal height the 
us food and drug administration warned last year 
health authorities also say steroids can cause breast enlargement 
in men along with testicle shrinkage impotence and enlarged 
prostate in women steroids have been linked to deepened voice 
beard growth baldness and breast diminution 
steroid users of either gender may also show liver disorders and 
roid rage which is increased aggression and antisocial 
behavior a study of steroidtaking athletes published earlier this 
year found mental problems ranging from deep depression to impulsive 
buying sprees and outbursts of violent rage 
anabolic steroids are different from antiinflammatory steroids 
which are commonly used in medicine anabolic steroids also have 
some medically approved uses such as treating certain types of

once again the agriculture department is going 
to let processors keep on making oldfashioned country hams until 
paperwork on a new food safety requirment is completed 
the deadline for ham producers to comply with new federal 
regulations was supposed to be dec 31 1988 but then the previous 
deadline was supposed to be last dec 31 and the one before that 
was dec 31 1986 there also was one on aug 6 1985 
now the departments food safety and inspection service said 
thursday the new deadline will be dec 31 1989 or whenever the 
agency finally approves the new rules spokeswoman irene goins said 
the lengthy rulemaking procedure involves those hams often seen 
on grocery shelves in cloth bags or hanging from rafters in country 
stores they must be scrubbed to remove mold and then soaked or 
boiled a couple of times to reduce the salt content 
theyre the kind of hams for which someone had to invent redeye 
gravy and in some parts of the country grits 
as the usda defines them theyre uncooked cured dried 
smoked or unsmoked pork products made from solid meat 
typically country or drycured hams are treated with salt and 
then put in a smokehouse to cure and age a total process that can 
take months or even years 
most hams sold in supermarkets are wetcured quickly in brine 
solutions and cooked before sale to consumers 
in march 1983 the usda proposed rules intended to help prevent 
trichinosis a disease caused by microscopic parasitic worms or 
trichinae that can occur in improperly cooked pork the proposed 
rules were directed at readytoeat pork products and drycured 
country hams 
shortly after the original proposal was adopted on feb 6 1985 
the agency learned that some federally inspected ham producers were 
using oldfashioned methods that didnt meet the new usda 
requirements and were ordered to show by aug 6 1985 that their 
curing procedures were safe 
the country ham industry protested so the usda allowed more 
time one compelling reason for the extensions of time for 
compliance was that no trichina problems had been associated with 
the drycured hams 
these traditional processing methods have been permitted 
because they are decadesold methods believed to be effective in 
destroying trichinae says ronald j prucha acting administrator 
of the usda agency 
we are researching the safety of traditional trichina control 
methods and developing a proposed rule for issuance in early 1989 
he said after we receive public comments on that proposal we 
will develop new regulations 
but just in case the usdas rulemaking machine is slower than 
officials hope the compliance deadline was extended another full 
year

the us agreement to talk with the palestine 
liberation organization spares presidentelect bush one politically 
difficult decision but gives him another arduous task overseeing 
that dialogue 
the decision by the reagan adminstration guarantees that the 
middle easts explosive problems will face bush as soon as he enters 
the oval office on jan 20 even though the vice president said 
thursday theres no game plan theres no fivepoint program 
although initial contacts with the plo are to begin in tunis 
tunisia later this week there is little doubt that the turnabout 
decision clears the way for the bush administration to try to bring 
israel and the palestinians into direct negotiations 
with tensions high on both sides of the 40yearold dispute such 
a task could be monumental 
bush not only will have to deal with plo chairman yasser arafat 
whom just a week before the reagan adminstration had branded a 
terrorist but hell have to do it in a way that avoids souring 
relations with israel 
bush stressed thursday that the initiative which he fully 
supported was a dialogue not negotations 
lets see how things evolve my position remains the same i 
want to see direct talks between for example between king hussein 
of jordan and the israelis he told reporters 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater denied that 
president reagan made the tough decision so bush wouldnt have to do 
it but he conceded the action could be helpful to the next 
administration 
this is one step further down the road in the pace process and 
should provide for new options fitzwater said 
he said reagan had conferred with bush before making the final 
decision although had not given bush veto power over it 
secretary of state george shultzs announcement wednesday that 
the united states would initiate a substantive dialogue with the 
plo saved bush from having to expend his own political capital in 
sorting out the issue 
less than a month after he denied arafat a visa and barred him 
speaking at the united nations in new york on grounds he was a 
terrorist shultz said the plo leader had met three conditions long 
insisted on by the administration 
bush said he fully supported the decision to open talks with the 
plo in light of arafats assertion that he had met the three us 
conditions recognition of israels right to exist a renunciation 
of terrorism and acceptance of two un peace resolutions 
although us officials have stressed that this country remains 
committed to the security of israel and still opposes an independent 
palestinian state the decision reversed a longstanding us refusal 
to deal with the plo 
israel has shown no indications it is willing to follow suit its 
government still refuses to deal with what it views as a terrorist 
organization devoted to its destruction 
major disputes continue to divide israel and the palestinians 
including the status of jerusalem 
while bush has had more experience in foreign affairs than any 
president since richard nixon his choice for secretary of state 
james a baker iii has relatively little background in that area 
however bakers reputation as a nonideological problem solver 
honed in exchangerate and trade negotiations with us economic 
allies in his 2 years as treasury secretary could help make up for 
this lack of experience 
bushs campaign record provides few clues to the kind of 
positions he might take as talks progress on the palestinian issue 
for the most part the vice president dodged most specific 
questions concerning the middle east as did democratic rival 
michael dukakis 
bush did speak forcefully during the campaign of his dedication 
to usisraeli strategic cooperation and he said he would not deal 
with the plo or back an independent palestinian state echoing 
administration positions of the day 
it remains to be seen whether reagan and shultzs legacy to bush 
and baker will be a blessing or a curse 
asked thursday if he would prefer that the talks wait until his 
administration starts next month bush replied i become president 
on jan 20 on jan 21 ill tell you what i want to do

sten andersson smiled at the television in his 
hotel suite when it carried the news that ended months of secret 
meetings and lastminute quibbles over words in two languages not 
his own 
the swedish foreign minister guided the diplomacy culminating in 
the us agreement to talk to the plo which secretary of state 
george p shultz announced wednesday night 
swedens effort to bring the united states and the palestine 
liberation organization together began on a trip andersson made to 
the middle east in march during that visit he saw the palestinian 
uprising now a year old against israeli rule in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
i met with about 100 boys shot by israeli soldiers some of 
them paralyzed for life he told reporters thursday 
the 64yearold swedish diplomat went to jordan after israel and 
talks with two plo leaders convinced him they wanted a separate 
palestinian state rather than the destruction of israel palestinians 
had preached for decades 
egyptians saudi arabians and envoys from several european 
nations were involved in negotiations that followed andersson said 
he met with vernon a walters washingtons ambassador to the united 
nations and hinted to the journalists of contacts with shultz 
he said sweden acted as a postman delivering messages but 
added i confess we have written some of the letters too 
eugene makhlouf plo delegate to stockholm said the swedes did 
most of the diplomatic maneuvering they worked very hard until we 
achieved this result he said just after the shultz announcement 
andersson described his role to a few reporters early thursday 
morning and at a crowded news conference later he told the news 
conference he approached american jews not israelis because he did 
not want the israeli government to know about his activities in 
advance 
the most crucial event was the meeting with the jewish 
personalities from the united states attended by khalid elhassan 
of the plo a fortnight before plo chairman yasser arafat came 
to stockholm andersson said 
rita hauser a prominent member of the republican party led the 
american jewish delegation at the secret meeting elhassan is a 
leading figure in the plo and a confidant of arafat 
after the meeting the foreign minister said he wrote a document 
expressing the agreements reached and both sides agreed to sign it 
the document was not made public until last week when arafat 
visited stockholm to meet with ms hauser and other american jews 
most of the meeting with arafat dealt with strategy for 
persuading the us government to deal with the plo 
anderssons last maneuvers were performed wednesday afternoon 
when he settled arguments over which words in english and arabic the 
united states would accept in arafats announcement that he 
renounced terrorism and accepted israels right to exist 
on tuesday us officials had said a speech by arafat to the 
un general assembly in geneva did not meet american conditions for 
contacts with the plo 
that speech and his statement wednesday seemed much the same but 
andersson said arafats remarks at the news conference in english 
cleared up questions of language that had disturbed the americans 
he said all the ideas expressed wednesday were in arafats speech 
in arabic a day earlier but were split up and in different 
words 
arabs have a different way of making speeches than americans the 
swedish diplomat observed they use a lot of words a lot of words 
always cause confusion misunderstanding if he arafat changes 
the words the americans say whats going on here 
arafat said in the speech for instance that he condemned 
terrorism and at the news conference that he renounced it 
makhlouf said one word covers for both concepts in arabic the 
plo representative added that another element contributed to the 
delay in a favorable response from washington they didnt believe 
their ears yesterday tuesday they needed to hear it again 
andersson whose diplomatic involvement with the arabisraeli 
conflict covers 25 years said he felt the us decision was an 
important step in breaking the middle east stalemate 
the beginning of peace is always dialogue but it has a long 
way to go he said

the government needs to funnel more money to 
the nations colleges and universities and to the students who wish 
to attend them a group of educators told a congressional panel on 
thursday 
witnesses appearing before the joint economic committees 
education and health subcommittee said that diverting more resources 
to postsecondary education would pay off in the long run with a 
higherskilled work force 
what we have done up to the present time in order to create a 
work force as motivated skilled and dedicated as those we confront 
in japan west germany and other industrialized nations has 
obviously not been adequate and can even be called tragically 
inadequate said stephen joel trachtenberg president of george 
washington university 
the subcommittee released a report on wednesday the first day of 
the twoday hearing that recommended ways to better american 
schools including lengthening the school year improving vocational 
education and other programs and increasing the emphasis on basic 
skills such as reading and studying 
but on thursday the panels chairman rep james scheuer 
dny emphasized what he said was a need to consider making 
postsecondary education available to all qualified students 
kindergarten through grade 12 education which was adequate for 
the work force of a predominantly agricultural nation adapting to 
industrialization is simply obsolete in todays complex and 
sophisticated hightech environment scheuer said 
the educators who addressed the committee agreed and argued that 
federal aid to colleges and universities has eroded in recent years 
robert h atwell president of the american council on education 
said the inflationadjusted value of the maximum pell grant award 
for colleges costs has declined by 13 percent during the 1980s 
atwell also noted that the numbers of minority students are 
projected to increase from onefifth of all american children under 
age 17 to onethird by the year 2000 in addition by the turn of 
the century more than one in seven workers will be nonwhite he 
said 
the federal government the states and institutions must 
develop a partnership in providing the financial resources and 
educational programs that will enable all our citizens to develop to 
their full potential he said

a scientific advisory panel has urged the 
department of energy to bolster the resistance to earthquakes of a 
weapons production reactor at the troubleplagued savannah river 
plant 
the panel also has concluded that to avoid confusion during a 
crisis fewer personnel should be regularly assigned to the control 
room of the k reactor at the facility near aiken sc the reactor 
currently is shut down because of maintenance and safety concerns 
the recommendations came in a letter released thursday to 
energy secretary john s herrington from the departments advisory 
committee on nuclear facility safety which doe established earlier 
this year to assess safety programs at the nuclear plant 
the three reactors at savannah river are the nations only source 
for tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen vital to boosting the 
explosive power of modern nuclear warheads because tritium decays 
at a rate of 55 percent a year it needs to be replenished 
regularly 
the advisory committee chaired by john f ahearne a former 
chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission declined to endorse a 
detailed doe report presenting the departments strategy for 
restarting the k reactor 
the justcompleted doe report outlined more than 160 separate 
tasks calling for a complete overhaul of training safety 
management operating and inspection procedures 
in the advisory panels 11page letter to herrington ahearne 
said that in our opinion the restart strategy document 
represents only an initial step in does efforts to develop sound 
operations at srp the savannah river plant 
he added that we have broad concerns regarding safety 
philosophy the overall criteria for restart and management 
a doe spokesman douglas elmets said in response to the letter 
secretary herrington has received this very constructive document 
we believe that this an important part of the process and we will 
respond in due course secretary herrington takes very seriously the 
recommendations of the advisory committee 
regarding earthquakes ahearne wrote the seismic resistance 
issue in the restart strategy appears to be narrowly focused does 
not indicate what must be completed before restart and tends to 
weaken the defenseindepth philosophy 
the seismic resistance criterion requires the capability to 
shut down cool and monitor core status for a design basis 
earthquake 02 g but it is not stated whether or not this needs 
to be completed before startup he said 
the g figure represents the strength of shaking that a 
structure undergoes during an earthquake a level of 02 g would be 
approximately equivalent to the force exerted by a nearby quake with 
a magnitude of 6 on the richter scale 
ahearne noted in the letter that seismic criteria for the 
confinement system and the ecs emergency core cooling system were 
not included because neither is considered to be a primary safety 
system crucial instruments are to be seismically qualified but 
the instrumentation system wiring sensors etc is neglected 
we recommend that the ecs and confinement systems be 
seismically upgraded prior to restart he said 
overall ahearne wrote a rationale should be developed for 
deciding which upgrades are of immediate concern which can be 
delayed until after restart and for how long 
on the control room issue the letter to herrington said current 
plans call for at least 12 people being in the k reactor control 
room when the reactor is restarted 
they include five reactor operators a technical support 
engineer a shift adviser a doe savannah river office onsite 
engineer an environmental safety and health inspector a doe 
headquarters observer a contractor oversight representative and a 
contract operations manager 
this number is clearly excessive ahearne wrote indeed it 
is difficult to see how such a large group could communicate 
effectively to provide prompt attention to any crisis situation the 
list of people required for plant control room duties should be 
reviewed carefully and access limited to essential personnel

identification laboratory will determine if the remains belong to 
any of the 1747 americans listed as missing in action or mia in 
vietnam 
the remains are all associated with incidents in the northern 
provinces they said they were found in lots of different 
circumstances and some of the remains were found by local 
villagers boyd said 
he said the vietnamese presented possible names associated with 
some of the remains boyd said the vietnamese also turned over 
information on 12 other missing americans 
xinhua the official chinese news agency quoted unidentified 
vietnamese sources as saying vietnam will step up the search for 
american mias and has agreed to accept more us teams to conduct 
searches 
the previous largest turnover of suspected mia remains involved 
27 sets handed over april 6 
boyd said a fourmember team of us forensic experts examined 45 
boxes of other remains in hanoi and found some that they recommended 
for analysis in the united states earlier reports had said 80 sets 
of remains were examined 
the other three teams searched binh tri thien and nghe tinh 
provinces in northcentral vietnam looking at us warplane crash 
sites and interviewing villagers who witnessed the crashes boyd 
said their 10day project ended thursday 
investigators focused on 70 discrepancy cases where the 
united states says vietnamese authorities should have information 
including cases of captured airmen who were never returned 
boyd said vietnamese and us technical experts would meet in 
hanoi on monday to wednesday to review work decide on possible 
repatriations and discuss future projects 
since the war ended vietnam has returned remains of 172 
americans which have been identified by the army laboratory 
currently 2383 americans are listed as mia 1747 in vietnam 
547 in laos 83 in cambodia and six in china 
the repatriation thursday was the seventh since retired gen john 
w vessey acting as a special us envoy reached agreement in 
august 1987 with vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach to end 
months of deadlock on the mia issue 
the first american combat troops landed in thensouth vietnam in 
march 1965 the paris peace accords in january 1973 halted us 
fighting in the conflict which claimed the lives of about 58000 
americans and ended in the communist victory over the usbacked 
south vietnamese government in april 1975 
bitter political bickering between hanoi and washington has often 
blocked accounting for the us missing the us government says it 
will not consider normalizing relations with vietnam until hanoi 
withdraws all its troops from cambodia and resolves the mia issue 
in laos us and laotian officials were continuing a joint 
excavation thursday in southern savannakhet province to try to 
determine the fate of a pilot shot down in 1968 the excavation to

the judge in the irancontra case on thursday 
scheduled a hearing for dec 21 to begin making final preparations 
for the trial of former white house aide oliver l north 
us district judge gerhard a gesell who has previously 
indicated the trial could begin as early as late january said in an 
order that he wanted to discuss procedures for screening potential 
jurors and other pretrial housekeeping matters 
the scheduling order provided yet another indication that gesell 
is determined to take the case to a speedy trial 
on monday he strictly limited the number of classified documents 
that north can introduce into evidence and set a jan 3 deadline for 
listing those secrets he would propose to disclose at the trial 
gesells rulings on secret documents earlier this week greatly 
increased the likelihood that all the charges against the former 
national security council aide will go to trial despite reagan 
administration refusal to release secret documents the defense wants 
to publicly disclose 
under the classified information procedures act gesell could 
still dismiss the central conspiracy charge against north if he 
determines that the withheld documents are needed to ensure that 
north gets a fair trial 
but the judge made clear that he would not allow north to 
introduce documents that were not relevant to his defense simply to 
scuttle his prosecution 
north is accused of conspiring to illegally divert usiran 
armssale profits to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
he faces a total of 14 felony counts including charges he lied 
to congress destroyed documents pocketed travelers checks intended 
for the contra leaders and illegally used a taxexempt foundation to 
raise money to arm the rebels 
three codefendants are set to be tried separately after north 
at next weeks hearing the judge said he wanted to consider the 
type of questionnaire that would be sent to prospective jurors 
gesell said he also wanted to set a deadline for independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh to provide norths lawyers with the grand 
jury testimony of the prosecution witnesses the defense is entitled 
to examine that testimony to prepare cross examination 
questionnaires are usually sent to jurors for lengthy or 
highprofile criminal cases such as the perjury trial of former 
white house aide michael k deaver 
the questions are designed to screen out jurors who would be 
unable to serve for a variety of reasons including their inability 
to render a fair verdict or to understand complicated evidence 
the completed questionnaires would be used as a basis to conduct 
jury selection in court 
the north trial which could last several months may require the 
court to order as many as 1000 questionnaires to screen out people 
who are unable to serve for the duration of the proceeding 
the questionnaire would likely also ask prospective jurors 
whether they could judge the evidence in the case free of any 
influence from the extensive publicity that has surrounded the 
irancontra affair

the agency regulating nationally chartered 
banks ordered its examiners on thursday to look for banks that have 
taken too big a chunk of the risky but lucrative business of 
financing leveraged buyouts 
the office of the comptroller of the currency which regulates 
about 4400 of the nations 14000 commercial banks issued a set of 
guidelines for banks and government examiners to determine whether a 
banks safety is endangered by involvement in the buyouts or lbos 
comptroller robert l clarke in a memo to all national banks 
said lbos are considerably more complex and characterized by 
higher levels of risk than more traditional forms of commercial bank 
lending 
but he acknowledged that lbos have become an important source of 
income for banks as their traditional source of income 
straightforward loans to corporations becomes more scarce 
lbos are a legitimate business activity as long as a banks 
board of directoers and management follow prudent banking principles 
and guard against unnecessary credit and legal risks clarke said 
in an lbo such as kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos 25 billion 
purchase of rjr nabisco inc an investment group borrows heavily in 
order to buy out stockholders and take over the company 
the companys new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of 
the company to pay back the loans critics of the practice fear the 
high debt levels in an economic downturn would endanger both the 
company and the group or bank that lends the money 
in guidelines issued to bank examiners the comptroller stressed 
diversification he said a bank should have policies in place 
ensuring it is not overly involved in lbos does not lend too much 
to a single borrower and does not concentrate its lending to a 
single industry 
banks also should have policies curbing potential conflicts of 
interest in lbos to guard against getting sued by the losing 
parties in takeover battles 
these are fundamental elements of any sound credit process but 
they are especially important in view of the risk characteristics of 
many lbos the guidelines said 
the cautions apply equally to banks that originate the loans and 
those that buy into the deals by participating through other 
larger banks they said 
the comptroller began working on the lbo guidelines after 
surveying the practices of 11 large money center banks and five 
regional banks in late spring and early summer 
according to loan pricing corp a new york company that monitors 
large banks loans to corporations banks have lent 70 billion in 
highly leveraged transactions since mid1987 
earlier this week the federal deposit insurance corp which 
insures bank deposits up to 100000 said a substantial but 
undetermined amount of bank profits this year are coming from lbos 
banks through the first nine months of this year reported record 
profits of 164 billion and likely will have earned more than 23 
billion by the end of the year the fdic said

a dutch court on thursday denied 
visitation rights to a sperm donor who sued for permission to visit 
his biological child a court spokesman said 
in the case which has gained widespread national attention a 
man who donated his sperm to a woman in a lesbian relationship 
sought the right to periodically meet the 15monthold daughter born 
as a result of the artificial insemination 
the donor claimed that an emotional attachment to the child 
developed over visits to the lesbian couple before and after the 
birth 
a month ago the utrecht court ruled that the father was entitled 
in principle to sue for his rights but dutch family law does 
not contain specific provisions outlining the rights of sperm donors 
the identities of both the plaintiff and the defendants in the 
lawsuit were not disclosed for reasons of privacy and court 
hearings six weeks ago took place behind closed doors 
in its ruling thursday the court said that in this particular 
case the tensions caused by periodical visits would be very 
serious and that is not in the interest of the child 
the ruling also said that in cases such as this visitation 
rights should only be granted in extraordinary circumstances it 
did not elaborate 
during the hearings the lesbian couple claimed that the 
friendship with the donor had ended and that serious personal 
conflicts had developed according to their lawyer arnoud willems 
he added that the couple had rejected the idea of an anonymous 
donor so that the father could be identified if the child later 
would ask for his name 
artificial insemination by donated sperm is a widespread practice 
in the netherlands but the strict confidentiality that prevents 
identification of the parties involved usually precludes such legal 
battles

quotas the agriculture department announced thursday 
deputy secretary peter c myers said the 1989 fluecured quota 
will be 8905 million pounds up 18 percent from this years 755 
million pounds the national acreage allotment will be increased to 
426485 acres from 379588 acres in 1988

per pound an increase of 26 cents from 1988 
the basic quota was increased on the 1988 fluecured tobacco crop 
for the first time since 1975 according to usda analysts 
reflecting a drawdown on stockpiles and brisk demand 
myers said fluecured tobacco farmers will vote in a mail 
referendum to be held jan 912 on whether to continue federal 
marketing quotas for the following three years 1990 1991 and 1992 
a twothirds majority will be required for the controls to continue

a leading advocate for americas children on 
thursday urged presidentelect bush to make good on his campaign 
promises to offer more government help to disadvantaged youth 
saying that eventually would save tax money as well as lives 
marian wright edelman president of the private childrens 
defense fund said the 1988 elections brought childrens needs into 
the national spotlight and that the debate over the next four to 
eight years will be on the form level and timetable of programs 
to help youngsters and improve child care 
in a speech to the national press club ms edelman said bushs 
campaign proposal for a 22 billion childrens tax credit is a 
welcome supplement to the child care bill that was considered 
but not enacted by the outgoing congress 
she noted bush also called during the campaign for support of the 
federal nutrition program for pregnant women and children increased 
head start education efforts expanded medicaid health coverage for 
lowincome families and new education initiatives 
i have confidence that he will keep his word ms edelman 
said i look forward on many occasions beginning in the 
state of the union address to his fulfilling it 
she said that failing to meet childrens needs early in life 
results in more costly problems later at a time of massive 
deficits america cannot afford to waste resources by failing to 
prevent and curb the deficits which cripple our children and cost 
billions in later remedial and custodial dollars she said 
ms edelmans remarks were excerpted from her organizations 
upcoming report a childrens defense budget a vision for 
americas children to be released in january 1989 
she recited a litany of troubling statistics about the levels of 
children living in poverty infant mortality gaps in prenatal care 
low birthweight babies children infected with the aids virus 
broken families and homelessness 
but she added this is for all its shadows not a gloom and 
doom speech it is a getoffournationalduff and saveourfuture 
speech 
ms edelman said her organizations most immediate goals include 
health insurance for poor families expanding the federal nutrition 
program to cover all pregnant women infants and children making 
head start available to all needy children ensuring that all 
children are fully immunized making quality child care available to 
all families and increasing the minimum wage 
we believe these goals are doable in four or five years and 
should be pursued as fast as the delivery systems of these 
successful programs can effectively serve more children she said 
the longer we wait the more children we will lose

when ivan boesky returns to his mansion 
after serving time for insider trading there wont be a 
jeffersonian dome to greet him 
the north castle zoning board of appeals voted 32 wednesday 
night to deny a request from boeskys wife seema to cap her 
17room georgian home in mount kisco with a dome similar to the one 
that tops thomas jeffersons monticello home in charlottesville va 
mrs boeskys plans were opposed by 11 neighbors 
she needed special permission from the board because her plans 
would have added a third floor to the house which is at the center 
of a 76acre estate called northview 
north castle zoning law limits buildings to 2 stories 
those voting against the proposal said approval would have set an 
undesirable precedent those supporting the dome said it would have 
had little impact 
boesky paid a record 100 million fine in 1986 to settle federal 
securities and exchange commission charges of insider stock trading 
and is serving a threeyear prison term after pleading guilty in 
april 1987 to a federal conspiracy charge boesky will be eligible

leading members of congress gave the new 
opening between the united states and the palestine liberation 
organization a wary welcome thursday and sought to reassure israel 
that us officials will be alert to any plo tricks 
this is good news and the right path to follow said sen 
claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee i think we would best be very careful that the plo 
continue to show real seriousness and be wary of any deception 
sen george mitchell the newly elected senate majority leader 
welcomed the us move and called it a significant step toward 
advancing the peace process 
it is consistent with what has been bipartisan american policy 
for over a decade mitchell dmaine said in a statement under 
that policy the us seeks to encourage direct negotiations between 
the parties without preconditions intended to achieve a stable and 
lasting peace 
mitchell said plo chairman yasser arafats acceptance of israels 
right to exist and renunciation of terrorism were important 
statements but in light of the plos record must be viewed 
with caution 
he added that the us action in no way represents or implies 
recognition of an independent palestinian state and reaffirmed 
strong and unwavering support for israels security 
the current senate majority leader robert byrd dwva called 
the opening a diplomatic turn of events that should not go 
unrecognized it is an opportunity that must be pushed forward 
despite the risks 
byrd added as israels real friends it is time to recognize 
the shift in posture by the plo our commitment to israel is firm 
and unswerving but it must be tempered by the realization that 
there are times when we must take those first tenuous steps toward 
peace 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign affairs 
committee also sought to reassure israel saying the us dialogue 
with the plo does not mean any lessening of us economic and 
military support to its ally 
it will take more than words to convince israel fascell 
said only the israelis can determine what is best for their own 
security so it should also be made very clear that there will be no 
attempt to impose a settlement on israel 
continued aid to israel the top recipient of us assistance is 
necessary both to calm israeli fears and as a clear signal to the 
plo and other parties that the united states is committed firmly to 
the independence of israel within secure borders he said 
another staunch israel supporter and foreign affairs committee 
member rep howard berman dcalif said he believed secretary of 
state george shultz was sincere in believing the opening would 
advance the cause of middle east peace 
i remain highly distrustful of the plo and of mr arafat 
berman said in an interview a carefully worded and hedged 
statement in geneva has to be put into the light of 20 years of 
terrorism and commitment to the destruction of israel i remain 
highly skeptical about the plos intentions 
but berman added i think we should put those intentions to a 
test moves to call off the palestinian uprising in the west bank 
and gaza and a rewriting of the plo charter to eliminate a pledge 
to destroy israel would help prove the organizations good faith he 
said 
its a risky move i hope what weve done here contributes to 
negotiations towards peace he said you cannot simply operate 
on the basis that the status quo can go on in perpetuity 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said the change in us policy 
may well be a historic step on the road to lasting peace in the 
middle east only time will tell whether the plo is genuinely 
prepared to live up the farreaching conditions they have now 
accepted 
its a very positive thing said sen john chafee rri 
there are two parties to the conflict out there the israelis and 
the palestinians to not talk to one of the groups is to ignore 
reality

palestinians elated by the us decision to talk 
to the plo celebrated in the streets thursday and credited their 
yearold uprising against israeli rule for the change in us policy 
but moslem fundamentalists rejected the decision as an american 
deception threatening to deepen divisions among palestinians in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip america is israel and israel 
is america said gaza city prayer leader ahmed yassin 
washingtons move failed to stop antiisraeli protests in the 
occupied lands sixteen palestinians were wounded in clashes with 
israeli troops including an 11yearold shot with a plastic bullet 
in the right eye arab hospital officials said 
the wounded also included a 23yearold palestinian who suffered 
a serious gunshot wound to the liver in the gaza strip town of rafah 
the army confirmed two of the wounded and said it was checking 
further 
dozens of palestinians marched through the streets of the west 
bank city of ramallah chanting proplo slogans and carrying banners 
reading yes to the plo and yes to the palestinian state 
a slogan sprayed on a wall in ramallah read the american 
position is a victory for the uprising and palestinian diplomacy 
residents of gaza city also expressed elation finally the 
americans are realizing that there is a palestinian people said a 
35yearold man who refused to give his name 
the sentiments were echoed by palestinian leaders 
the uprising has succeeded beyond our expectations by changing 
the political climate said hanna siniora a plo supporter and 
editor of the daily al fajr newspaper in arab east jerusalem 
siniora said palestinians in the occupied lands had put the plo 
leadership under great pressure to translate the uprising into 
political gains and this pressure led to recent plo statements of 
moderation 
all of a sudden we were able to say publicly what we had been 
saying privately before lets recognize israel siniora told 
the associated press 
clear recognition of israel was one of three conditions set by 
washington for talks with the plo the others were renunciation of 
terror and acceptance of un resolutions recognizing the right of 
all nations in the region to live within secure borders 
siniora acknowledged that palestinians were deeply divided over 
the next steps the road to peace is full of obstacles such as 
the opposition of hardliners on both sides he said 
moslem fundamentalists and hardline plo factions refuse to 
recognize israel they say all of israel should be returned to 
palestinian control 
yassin a prominent moslem fundamentalist said plo chief yasser 
arafat made too many concessions to win washingtons approval 
arafat gave everything to israel and he got nothing in return but 
promises the wheelchairbound prayer leader said in an interview 
he also expressed skepticism over the new us policy to all 
appearances there is a change in american policy but deep inside 
there is nothing new he said 
but other palestinians said the us decision marked a 
breakthrough in the stalled middle east peace process and they 
urged israel to end its refusal to talk with the plo 
i think the americans will pressure israel and the world 
cannot live with prime minister yitzhak shamirs stubbornness 
said saeed kanaan a plo supporter and businessman in nablus no 
doubt israel is going to be isolated

by the seller sothebys said 
washingtons letter was sent in 1795 to a group of officials 
protesting a treaty john jay negotiated to settle differences

terms under which american jews could visit that the russian 
government said they could visit only on business

patrick ryan boasts of his skill in electronics 
carpentry mechanics and welding and he made a mark in the roman 
catholic church by raising money for african missions 
those were the talents according to the british government that 
the roman catholic priest brought to the deadly work of the irish 
republican army 
ryan it is alleged in extradition warrants rejected by belgium 
and then by ireland conspired to commit murder and cause explosions 
in britain between 1975 and 1988 
according to press reports attributed to british government 
sources ryan supplied the timers for scores of bombs and solicited 
cash and gold from libyas moammar gadhafi 
a lean cleanshaven man with a receding hairline the 
58yearold ryan is said by his brother joe to able to speak nine 
languages and fly airplanes and run six miles a day 
i am a member generally of the catholic church ryan said 
recently i have been a member of the pioneer total abstinence 
association since the age of 12 and i am still a teetotaler 
after that i belong to no other organization either overt or 
covert 
so do i belong to the ira i did not never have am not and 
have no intention he told the tipperary star on nov 28 his only 
interview since his arrest 
ryan is the focus of a diplomatic impasse across the irish sea 
prime minister margaret thatcher wants to put him on trial but 
irelands attorney general john murray concluded that the priest 
could not get a fair trial in britain 
ryan vowed that he will never stand before a british court and 
staged a 22day hunger strike in belgium after the british sought 
his extradition 
ryan was born june 26 1930 in rossmore county tipperary one of 
six children in a farming family 
he attended the christian brothers school and the pallottine 
college in nearby thurles and was ordained june 6 1954 
while he was with us we could see a man who was zealous 
hardworking and very orthodox said the rev donal mccarthy 
rector of the students house of the pallottine fathers of thurles 
in many ways he could have been an idealist 
the young priest was assigned to mission work in the diocese of 
mbulu in tanzania where he was involved in welldigging projects 
his colleagues according to the sunday times recalled him as a 
pastor who cared both for the spiritual and economic needs of his 
flock 
in 1967 ryan was assigned as a curate in an east london church 
in 1970 he returned to ireland to promote african missions 
at that time ryan reportedly became preoccupied with the 
struggles in northern ireland where the mainly catholic ira has 
waged an armed campaign against british rule 
in 1973 ryan rejected a transfer to a church in england 
he told me at that time that he felt in conscience bound to 
work for the dependents of prisoners and those who had died in 
northern ireland said the rev william hanly the pallottine 
provincial in dublin 
ryan said in the star interview that i would travel through 
the airports principally of paris and rome to various parts of the 
world collecting a few pence more than a few pence a lot of 
money 
but i found that i would be just stopped at a frontier and 
i would be given no reason other than you cant pass so i decided 
if i couldnt pass one way i was going to pass another way thus 
he said he traveled on a forged passport 
according to british authorities one of ryans contributions to 
the ira was discovering a gadget called memopark a timer intended 
to remind a motorist when the parking meter expired 
ryan allegedly bought every memopark some 400 of them in stock 
at a novelty shop in zurich switzerland in 1975 subsequently 
british sources have said remains of the timers were found at the 
scene of 185 bombings in northern ireland and three in london 
ryan was arrested in geneva in 1976 and timers were found in his 
possession 
ryan also went free when scotland yard was unable to develop 
evidence that he had committed any offense on swiss soil 
he was arrested and freed again in france in december 1976 in 
italy in february 1977 and in luxembourg the next month 
ryans last arrest was on june 30 in brussels belgian police 
said they found found timers circuitry and manuals about bombs in 
his possession 
in my living room they found all kinds of books ryan told 
the star i am an excellent mechanic very good with electronics 
a good plumber carpenter welder i have a variety of books on all 
these subjects i have also books on music as i play the mandolin 
and banjo

religious professional and social 
leaders urged the government on thursday to postpone presidential 
elections until a wave of ethnic violence that killed 109 people 
this week subsides 
at the same time rival sinhalese and tamil guerrillas called for 
boycott of mondays election sinhalese extremists said the 
government was incapable of conducting fair balloting and 
separatist tamils blamed the two main candidates for violence that 
has wracked this indian ocean island for five years 
a military spokesman said sinhalese radicals shot and stabbed to

directors of a charitable foundation were accused 
thursday of siphoning off nearly 7 million to support their own 
lavish habits including chauffeured limousines nights at the opera 
and trips to florida and israel 
in a lawsuit filed in state supreme court in manhattan state 
attorney general robert abrams said officials of the nate b and 
frances spingold foundation systematically looted the organizations 
coffers from 1983 to 1988 depleting its assets by almost 50 percent 
in particular abrams said james r halperin the foundations 
chief administrative officer took more than 5 million in salary to 
perform simple administrative duties 
abrams said halperin and not the charities he was supposed to 
support was the chief beneficiary of the foundation 
halperin a manhattan lawyer allegedly billed the foundation at 
a rate of 275 to 350 an hour for his services his hours 
increased according to the attorney generals office from an 
average of 29 per week in 1984 to an average of 77 per week in 1986 
and 1987 
in its lawsuit the attorney generals office demanded the 
removal of halperin and melvyn levitan as directors of the 
foundation and demanded repayment of losses resulting from their 
alleged misconduct 
at abrams request state supreme court justice carmen bauchamp 
ciparick issued a temporary restraining order barring halperin and 
four other defendants from using any more of the foundations funds 
calls to the foundation for comment were referred to halperins 
lawyer gerald shargel who was in court and could not immediately 
be reached 
according abrams office the spingold foundation was established 
in 1955 by nate b and frances spingold to make contributions to 
charitable educational and religious organizations 
the foundations assets have decreased from 125 million in 1983 
to 64 million this year his office said no figures were 
available on how much the foundation gave to organizations during 
that period 
nate spingold died in 1958 his wife and her son herbert 
levitan supervised the foundation until both of them died of 
natural causes in 1976 
halperin has served as director and chief administrative officer 
of the foundation since 1975 while melvyn levitan mrs spingolds 
grandson has been a director since 1977 and president of the 
foundation since july 1987 
the others named in the suit are nedda strasbourger frimi 
mendlowitz and adrienne halperin 
according to an affidavit filed by abrams office the 
defendants alleged excesses included dinners a trip by halperin 
and his wife to florida the purchase of an unneeded luxury office 
for the foundation and a trip to israel 
in addition the affidavit charged that halperin leased 
automobiles including a mercedes and a cadillac at foundation 
expense and that he and other directors allegedly hired chauffeured 
limousines to take them to the theater opera and ballet and to 
department stores for shopping gala benefits and airports

the life expectancy for blacks has dropped for 
two consecutive years for the first time since 1970 when mortality 
data was first broken down by race according to a federal report 
while the white population experienced an increase in life 
expectancy to a record high of 754 years from 1985 to 1986 the 
black rate declined to 694 years the same level as in 1982 
despite that most recent twoyear decline the report notes that 
the largest gain in life expectancy between 1970 and 1986 was for 
both black males and females 52 years followed by white males 4 
years and white females 32 years 
the annual figures released recently by the national center for 
health statistics are derived from comparing us bureau of the 
census data with death certificates filed in the 50 states and 
district of columbia 
the 55page report which contains dozens of tables breaking down 
death rates in a variety of ways such as age and sex in addition to 
race makes no attempt at explaining any of the trends shown by the 
figures 
however the tables show there was a 15 percent increase in 
homicides among blacks between 1985 and 1986 compared to a 5 
percent increase among whites 
homicide was the fifth leading cause of death among black males 
and the ninth leading cause of death among black females in 1986 
homicide was not among the top 10 causes of death for either white 
males or females 
accidents the fourth leading cause of death overall increased 8 
percent among blacks and 4 percent among whites 
death rates among blacks were lower in 1986 than the previous 
year for heart disease cerebrovascular diseases chronic liver 
disease and cirrhosis atherosclerosis nephritis nephrotic 
syndrome and nephrosis and congenital anomalities 
overall the death rate for blacks was 15 times that of whites 
in 1986 with wide fluctuations among the 15 causes of death for 
example blacks were half as likely to commit suicide as whites and 
58 times more likely to die from homicide 
blacks were 12 times more likely to die accidentally than 
whites but slightly less likely to die in an automobile accident 
the only other category where the 1986 death rate was lower among 
blacks than whites was pulmonary disease and associated conditions

rep bill young had a busy speaking schedule in 
the first weeks of 1987 jetting to places like atlanta los 
angeles dallas and seattle as part of the multimilliondollar 
congressional honoraria circuit 
between jan 5 and feb 6 the florida republican made 18 
speeches all of them to major defense contractors who have more 
than passing interest in hearing from a member of a house 
appropriations subcommittee that has a major role in pentagon 
spending 
the whirlwind schedule was not without its reward 29000 in 
speaking fees from the likes of rockwell lockheed and boeing an 
amount that the census bureau says is just 1853 below what the 
median us household collected in income for all of 1987 
young didnt keep all of his earnings his financial disclosure 
statement says he gave 3200 to charity which brought his 
speechmaking net to 25800 or 84 less than house rules allowed 
him to keep he made no more forpay speeches after feb 6 
harry glenn youngs press secretary said thursday the 
lawmakers honoraria appearances were lumped together because he 
only schedules them during times when congress either is not in 
session or has a light schedule as generally occurs in january he 
said young generally works a 7 am10 pm day while on these 
visits meeting with company officials and touring plants not just 
speaking for a fee he learned something from these trips glenn 
said 
young is not unique among the 390 representatives and 87 senators 
who in 1987 pulled in 98 million on the honoraria circuit a 
controversial perk being targeted for oblivion by reformers a 
federal pay commission and influential lawmakers like house speaker 
jim wright dtexas 
the commission said that public faith in the integrity of 
congress is threatened by the steady growth in honoraria which rose 
30 percent from 1986 to 1987 
the only principled argument that can be made for the practice 
of accepting honoraria is that official salaries are far too low and 
must be supplemented for a public official to meet his family 
obligations the panel said 
its recommendation to the white house and congress ban honoraria 
and raise congressional pay from 89500 a year to 135000 
the champion honoraria earner for 1987 was rep dan rostenkowski 
dill the chairman of the ways and means committee the panel that 
originates most tax legislation in congress 
rostenkowski is so much in demand by a broad segment of 
businesses industries and trade associations that his 22 paid 
appearances in january 1987 brought in 76500 in honoraria 
even though the powerful chief taxwriter of the house had taken 
in more than nearly three times the 25884 that house rules allowed 
him to keep rostenkowski didnt withdraw from the 1987 honoraria 
circuit 
he kept talking and by years end his voice had brought in 
245000 25844 for dan rostenkowski 219156 for the laverne 
and dan rostenkowski charity fund 
a spokesman says the funds money was distributed about 5050 
among chicago and nonchicago health ethnic religious and 
educational groups with bona fide charity status rostenkowski 
doesnt release their names 
weve been running a robin hood program taking from the tax 
lawyers and giving to the poor says the spokesman who declined 
to be quoted by name 
in 1987 225 million of the 98 million in congressional 
honoraria ended up going to charities and nonprofit institutions 
an income source that could dry up if the white house and congress 
accept the pay commissions plan 
rostenkowskis spokesman says the chairman will continue his 
philanthropy even if congress votes to abolish speaking fees which 
are frequently paid by groups with a financial stake in a particular 
lawmakers committee and floor votes 
the spokesman says rostenkowski will help his favorite charities 
raise money by volunteering to be a drawing card at their 
fundraising events 
rostenkowski was one of three lawmakers who went into six digits 
on the 1987 honoraria circuit in second place with 118588 was 
budget committee chairman bill gray dpa who gave 94938 to 
charity third was senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
106050 with 80000 to charity both gray and dole kept less for 
themselves than capitol hill rules permit 
the house lets members keep honoraria earnings up to 30 percent 
of official salary or 26850 in the senate the factor is 40 
percent or 35800 in 1987 44 senators took in less than this 
amount twentysix of them listed no charitable contributions on 
their disclosure forms 
the new senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine was 
above average in honoraria earnings and below average in giving to 
charity he took in 42225 about 6000 above the norm and gave 
away 7350 about 2000 below the average senators giving 
one senator who will be able to watch next years payhonoraria 
debate with detachment is dan quayle rind who as vice president 
will fall under the existing ban on paid speechmaking by the 
executive branch and the judiciary 
in 1987 quayle was more active on the honoraria circuit than the 
average senator he collected 49255 kept 34953 and gave 14302 
to charity

helps to work toward the solution of a delicate problem

a dozen children and teenagers seemed 
to be enjoying themselves thursday rummaging through boxes of 
clothes and toys but the laughter and the smiles vanished as they 
remembered they didnt have a home or parents to return to 
eight days after an earthquake in northwestern armenia sundered 
homes and families officials can only guess at the number of 
children killed or left orphans 
many survivors are having nightmares and the soviet childrens 
fund a charity sent a team of 11 child psychologists to armenia to 
help 
who has trouble sleeping psychologist valeria mukhina asked 
the group of children whose parents are dead or missing 
nearly all raised their hands and yelled i do i do 
the therapy session had begun 
the youngsters from seven to 15 years old were sitting in a 
recital hall of yerevans music conservatory the building was 
converted into a childrens relief center and the hall was filled 
with donated toys and clothes 
sit back and close your eyes the pscychologist told the 
children frightening pictures may come to you but forget about 
everything force yourself to see the best the sky birds the 
children broke in with their own suggestions flowers a warm sun 
their eyes still closed children were told to imagine themselves 
in a forest and told to care for dolls they had just received 
mukhina seemed to be trying to establish the dolls as a symbol of 
security to replace that which was lost with the disappearance of 
their parents 
hold the doll which loves you she said pushing the new 
toys into the childrens embrace take care of the dolls lead 
them into the world keep everything frightening away from your 
doll 
then she concluded when i count to three you will say goodbye 
to your forest and tonight you will rejoin it and sleep peacefully 
the suggestion worked so well that 12yearold lena chudliny 
didnt open her eyes again when the count ended but when she woke 
up the shock of the quake returned and she began to cry 
albert likhanov head of the childrens fund was watching and 
went over to embrace lena and comfort her 
lenas 15yearold brother ruslan told in a matteroffact way 
what he could not get out of his mind 
we had an english class we sat writing the teacher said 
tomorrow there will be a quiz then everything started to shake 
ruslan said recalling when the quake struck his hometown of 
leninakan at 1141 am 
lets get out we shouted ruslan said 
a classmate of ruslans who identified himself as saak 
described how the class managed to get outside and saw one entire 
class crushed as they tumbled from the third floor to the ground 
soldiers later pulled up in a tank and took the students away 
ruslan said he doesnt know what happened to his parents 
in an interview mukhina explained that she tries to help the 
children cope with the tragedy by replacing negative emotions with 
good thoughts but she said the process is likely to take years 
in the meantime the children are staying in a yerevan school 
playing with their new toys and going to movies and concerts 
authorities are arranging longer term care in sanitariums throughout 
the soviet union said simon alexanyants an armenian doctor 
specializing in child health care 
some armenians say the children should be kept in the small 
southern republic of armenia rather than being sent out to other 
parts of the soviet union but alexanyants said all eventually will 
return

inspection plan for the cleveland area or face a cutoff of 20 
million in federal highway funds 
unless the state legislature complies with the federal clean air 
act by ordering tailpipe inspections in populous cuyahoga county 
which includes cleveland federal highway money to the county will 
be blocked 60 days after the order is published in the federal 
register 
in addition carbon monoxidespewing smokestack industries will 
be denied new construction permits and air pollution control grants 
to ohio will be reduced by 64000 under the sanctions given final 
epa approval 
if those penalties dont prod state lawmakers into enacting a 
tailpipe inspection bill the epa is ready to wield yet another 
club the loss of sewage construction grant money perhaps 20 
million worth 
spokeswomen for gov richard celeste and the state environmental 
protection agency said avoiding the sanctions has become a top 
priority for the new year 
we are working with the governors office on draft legislation 
which we hope to introduce as early as possible in january ohio 
epa spokeswoman jennifer lane maier said i would give the federal 
government what theyve asked for 
press secretary debra phillips said the governor believes there 
is time to beat the 60day deadline 
state sen lee fisher a cleveland democrat agreed he predicted 
the penalties would force the legislature to enact a tailpipe 
testing bill though with a lot of kicking and screaming 
ohio will come into compliance he said we cant afford to 
lose those funds 
cuyahoga county was singled out because of violations of federal 
air pollution standards specifically levels of carbon monoxide 
in high concentrations the poisonous gas can cause dizziness 
nausea blurred vision headaches and delayed reaction times 
tailpipe inspections are considered an effective antidote for 
high carbon monoxide levels because 85 percent of the gas comes from 
the exhaust fumes of cars and trucks 
though no other us city currently is suffering the loss of 
highway construction money there are about 10 other areas under 
construction bans including cincinnatis kentucky suburbs chicago 
and some of its suburbs albuquerque nm and st cloud minn 
epa spokesman chris rice said 
highway funding sanctions were lifted recently against 
albuquerque after a year and a half four areas in california were 
under the same restrictions for nearly two years but those also 
have been lifted he said 
even with the sanctions many highway projects will continue to 
get their full federal funding because the government doesnt 
withhold money for safety improvements and projects that have a 
beneficial effect on air quality

the opposition labor party on thursday derided mi5 
britains counterintelligence agency as one of the worst secret 
services in the west and said it has a long history of recruiting 
and promoting soviet agents 
it has made itself ridiculous because it believes it is above 
scrutiny said labor deputy leader roy hattersley 
hattersley spoke during a parliamentary debate on a bill proposed 
by the conservative government of prime minister margaret thatcher 
to license bugging and breakins by the agency 
the security services bill will give a basis in law for the first 
time to the 79yearold agency whose existence successive 
governments long refused even to acknowledge 
hattersleys attack reflected complaints by the opposition and 
civil liberties groups that the bill fails to provide any 
parliamentary control over mi5 its chiefs will continue to report 
secretly to the prime minister and the home secretary 
the agency became the focus of renewed public attention during a 
threeyear court battle which the government finally lost this 
year to suppress the memoirs of exagent peter wright his book 
spycatcher includes charges that mi5 tried to destabilize a 
labor government 
several soviet agents from the british upper classes kim 
philby guy burgess donald maclean and anthony blunt were 
recruited at cambridge university in the 1930s to work for the 
british secret services mi5 and mi6 its sister 
intelligencegathering agency have been dogged by subsequent spy 
scandals 
the european court of human rights is hearing complaints arising 
from charges in 1985 that mi5 agents tapped the telephones of 
antinuclear campaigners and labor union leaders on the instructions 
of cabinet ministers 
home secretary douglas hurd on thursday denied that mi5 is 
locked in some time warp of the 1950s forever fighting shadows 
that have long since disappeared 
but he refused to comment on whether agents have tapped labor 
leaders telephones i am not going to comment on past 
operations he said 
under the bill agents will require a warrant now unnecessary 
from hurd to bug or break into property and an independent 
commissioner will monitor the granting of warrants 
the bill also provides for a tribunal of lawyers to hear 
complaints from people who suspect they are targets of improper 
surveillance but critics charge official secrecy laws ban revealing 
the activities of the secret services

solidaritys lech walesa said thursday that 
he sees increasing prospects for agreement with the communist 
government perhaps through longawaited round table talks that 
would include his banned union movement and the church 
there is a chance now i dont know if it is honest or just a 
fake but i cannot destroy it there are many new elements which we 
must notice walesa said at his first news conference since 
returning from france on monday 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski meanwhile told a communist 
party audience we are looking for roads of still wider national 
reconciliation 
there is still only one criterion a feeling of responsiblity 
for the country and the good of poland jaruzelski said in a 
speech thursday marking the partys 40th anniversary 
parts of walesas news conference were broadcast thursday night 
on statecontrolled television the first time his weekly meeting 
with reporters was treated by the tv as a normal news event 
walesa said solidarity the independent union movement in the 
soviet bloc remains ready for serious talks which would assure 
pluralism 
now at the end of the year there are buds of hope to obtain 
solutions accepted by both sides the round table is a chance which 
could give life to these hopes which were born out of seven years 
of mutual brawling 
plans to hold the talks broke down in november when authorities 
refused to guarantee their willingness to relegalize the labor 
federation crushed in the martial law crackdown seven years ago 
this week 
but walesas appearance in a nationwide tv debate on nov 30 and 
the increasing attention given his views in the statecontrolled 
media this month indicated a growing acceptance of the solidarity 
leader by officials 
walesas being allowed to go to france also underlined his 
improved standing with officials 
government spokesman jerzy urban on tuesday praised walesas 
statements during his trip and said the talks could discuss the 
future of trade union pluralism 
asked about urbans comments walesa said it is very close to 
dotting the i but the dot is still missing 
opposition sources said walesa will meet this weekend with a 
council of 60 independent intellectuals and worker activists that he 
consults on major policy issues 
in another development the party leadership announced a central 
committee meeting for tuesday and wednesday to discuss political 
reforms and the role of the party urban has said the plenum could 
bring new impetus to national agreement 
walesa said solidarity has been maintaining contacts with 
authorities through a roman catholic church intermediary the rev 
alojzy orszulik 
he said the talks would cover unions economic problems and ways 
to cooperate to improve living conditions 
walesa the 1983 nobel peace laureate agreed this year to end a 
wave of strikes demanding relegalization of solidarity after the 
government agreed to the talks

presidentelect george bush will 
continue diplomatic and economic sanctions imposed in an effort to 
force out gen manuel antonio noriega the de facto ruler of panama 
the us ambassador says 
bush will not be disposed to abandon the pressure for change 
and democracy in panama no matter what noriega might want 
ambassador arthur davis told a dinner wedneday night of the american 
chamber of commerce and industry of panama the embassy released his 
remarks thursday 
davis said the united states would end sanctions when noriega 
resigned as as commander of the panamanian military a position he 
uses to control the country 
the beginning of political stability only can be achieved if 
noriega relinquishes power davis said 
noriega is under us indictment on charges of drug trafficking 
and money laundering he denies the accusations 
in 1988 we have observed in panama a progressive deterioration 
of human rights a growing disdain for justice and respect for laws 
the unconstitutional ouster of president eric arturo delvalle and 
the loss of confidence in the economy davis declared 
he said the government nominally led by president manuel solis 
palma was unconstitutional noriega arranged delvalles dismissal by 
the national assembly on feb 26 after delvalle had tried to fire 
the general 
davis said us sanctions were not to blame for panamas economic 
crisis and were not meant to hurt the panamanian people 
the panamanian economy cannot begin its recovery unless the 
political crisis of this country is resolved in a satisfactory 
manner for all panamanians he said 
economic sanctions which which forbid us operations to pay 
taxes to panama are doing what they were created to do theyre 
preventing cash from reaching the hands of an illegal regime 
davis said 
noriega claims washington seeks an excuse to violate the 1977 
treaties under which control of the panama canal will be given to 
panama on dec 31 1999 davis said canal security can be guaranteed 
only with genuine progress toward democracy and a civilian and 
constitutional government in panama 
davis said presidential elections scheduled for may 7 would be 
worthless if noriega remained in his post 
as long as noriega clings to power we dont believe that the 
elections can be accepted by panamanians as the product of an 
authentic process he said 
most opposition parties take a similar position arguing that 
sufficient election and press guarantees do not exist the 
government has closed three newspapers three radio stations and a 
television station

a lawyer for arrow air accepted the canadian 
aviation safety boards conclusion that ice on the wings caused a 
plane crash at gander newfoundland that killed 256 americans three 
years ago 
the letter to the board from lawyer humphrey dawson was obtained 
thursday by the canadian press news agency it said that while arrow 
does not agree with some matters contained in the report they do 
accept the report as published and do not propose in any way to 
challenge the same 
he did not elaborate on which matters the company disagrees 
arrow air was the operator of the charter dc8 that crashed on 
dec 12 1985 killing 248 us troops and eight crew members the 
soldiers were heading home to fort campbell ky from peacekeeping 
duties in the middle east 
the board concluded dec 8 that ice on the wings was the likely 
cause but a significant minority said in a separate opinion that an 
inflight fire caused the crash 
the often public disputes during the long investigation and the 
sharp split led to repeated calls here for a judicial inquiry 
dawson said arrow doesnt want one 
it is my clients present view that they would not participate 
in any such review or inquiry a view with which i wholly concur 
he said 
i hope the board will now be able to put this sad incident and 
its recently troubled history behind it having regard to the 
important role it must play in civil aviation in canada 
he said the release of the boards majority and minority reports 
means the issues on the whole have been raised

defense minister humberto ortega 
accused the reagan administration thursday of continuing supply 
flights to nicaraguan rebels in violation of a congressional ban 
gen ortega whose brother daniel is president of nicaragua also 
told a news conference that battle casualties in 1988 were 
dramatically lower than the previous years total 
he claimed nicaraguan radar detected 10 clandestine supply 
flights into nicaragua from el salvador in november 
the united states has supported the rebels known as contras 
since 1981 two years after a civil war in which the leftist 
sandinistas deposed the late president anastasio somoza 
congress stopped us military aid to the rebels at the end of 
february but allowed distribution of nonlethal aid to continue in 
neighboring honduras about 10000 rebels returned to base camps in 
honduras to get the food and uniforms 
ortega said rebel forces totaled no more than 7000 of whom 
about 2000 were in nicaragua 
he said the presence of contras in nicaragua means a war 
situation still exists and the rebels can do damage 
nicaragua has an army of about 80000 the largest in central 
america and gets its military equipment from the soviet bloc 
the defense minister said government forces killed 2226 rebels 
in 1988 down from 5339 the previous year and 611 sandinista 
soldiers were killed compared with 1613 in 1987 
he said civilian casualties rose to 1748 from 1675 in 1987 but 
did not break the number down into dead and wounded ortega said the 
number rose because of kidnappings by rebel forces 
the sandinistas and contras signed a ceasefire march 23 that 
called for the rebels to stop fighting in exchange for democratic 
concessions talks on details of the agreement reached a stalemate 
in september 
both sides stopped offensive operations march 21 when the talks 
began the government has renewed the ceasefire each month since a 
formal 60day truce ended may 31 
on thursday the defense minister claimed the contras had killed 
69 civilians since the march agreement wounded 79 and kidnapped 
372 he said 70 soldiers had been killed 73 were wounded and seven 
were missing 
ortega flanked by the military high command said nicaraguans 
should be prepared for a us invasion the sandinistas have made 
that claim repeatedly 
he said honduran forces have harassed nicaraguan positions on the 
border to provoke a confrontation that would give honduras an excuse 
to request help from the united states

federal election officials under court order 
to clarify how political parties can spend campaign funds heard 
democratic and republican spokesman warn thursday that too much 
regulation could stamp out politicking at the local level 
while other critics told the federal election commission that 
current rules have led to illegal use of socalled soft money the 
national political parties lobbied for flexibility in what the state 
and local parties can do 
the issue revolves around how to apply the federal election laws 
to the local entities who get money from the national parties and 
whose activity can provide overlapping benefit to presidential and 
congressional candidates 
if you like a campaign that involves people at the local level 
then dont go down that slippery slope of microregulation 
republican national committee counsel mark braden told the 
commission he warned that if the local parties are forced into 
complicated bookkeeping on what money is spent for federal and 
nonfederal campaigns they will probably ignore the rules or simply 
bow out of campaigning that would freeze out grassroots activity 
and shift to a total national tv campaign he said 
braden and his democratic counterpart joseph rieser jr argued 
that where federal and local goals overlap the local and state 
parties should not be saddled with complicated allocation formulas 
but should be allowed to allocate the funds to federal and 
nonfederal accounts in a way that best suits their situation 
no matter how stringent the rules the fec wont be able to 
accomplish complete fairness braden said 
you draw up the rules i get paid to manipulate them he 
said whatever you do is going to be maniplated to some degree 
rieser denied that the dnc gives money to local and state parties 
only to help the presidential race he said the party has an 
interest in local level politics as well 
different states have different political situations that would 
make it unfair to lock them into using a standard formula for how 
much of their activity benefits federal elections versus local 
elections 
for instance california had a plethora of hotlycontested ballot 
initiatives and many tight legislative races on which the state and 
local parties invested heavily for slate mailers and 
getoutthevote activity other states had little state election 
interest and were more focused on the presidential race 
the public hearing testimony was a step in fec compliance with a 
federal court order that said the commissions rules were too vague 
on soft money which is banned in federal elections but is permitted 
in many states 
soft money generally refers to union and corporate donations as 
well as individual contributions in excess of the federal limit of 
1000 such funds are banned in federal elections but permitted in 
many states 
the focus of the current fec deliberations is how the parties 
should allocate funds to soft or nonfederal accounts and to 
federal accounts for campaign activities that benefit both federal 
and nonfederal candidates such activities include voter 
registration and getoutthevote drives as well as slate cards and 
administrative costs 
fred wertheimer president of common cause a longtime critic of 
the system said that both parties in 1988 brazenly flouted the 
limits imposed by federal law on the sources and amounts of 
permissable contributions in connection with federal elections 
noting that both parties had raised millions of dollars in soft 
money he accused them of using the system to circumvent the limits 
on what they could spend for their presidential nominees by doing it 
through state party activity 
braden and rieser both said they knew of no examples of soft 
money being spent on the campaigns of george bush and democrat 
michael dukakis but they acknowledged that party spending at any 
level inevitably helps the top of the ticket 
that sort of activity affects all elections said rieser 
you cant help a legislative candidate without helping the top 
of the ticket said braden everything affects everything else 
the rnc raised in the neighborhood of 70 million this year with 
about 20 million of that in soft money braden said 
however those figures did not include another 25 million that 
was raised through the victory 88 program the rnc set up in 
each state with the funds going directly into state accounts rather 
than to the rnc 
the democrats said rieser raised about 60 million this year 
with some 18 million of that in soft money 
both parties had programs to court highdollar givers who 
contributed sums of 100000 or more 
the federal system permits an individual to give no more than 
25000 per year in federal election contributions including to 
parties and candidates but unlimited sums can be donated to 
nonfederal accounts

chinese and american officials on thursday began 
three days of scholarly discussions and banquets to mark the 10th 
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations 
in the first of many toasts to be raised over the next few days 
us ambassador winston lord told hundreds of chinese scholars let 
us commit ourselves not only to expanding our exchanges of 
delegations and goods but also to that everelusive more profound 
goal the exchange of understanding 
chinas foreign ministry plans a straitlaced dinner and evening 
of traditional entertainment friday at the imposing great hall of 
the people 
lords wife bette bao lord said she is planning a more 
lighthearted party saturday that will involve ushers in panda suits 
its not going to be a reception it will be a happening she 
said we want to have fun 
both sides said the state of chineseus relations is cause for 
celebration but acknowledged that friction exists over trade human 
rights issues and the status of the rival nationalist government on 
taiwan 
ten years ago nobody could imagine that the two countries 
would develop the kinds of extensive and permeating contacts that 
exist today zi zhongyun director of the chinese academy of 
social sciences institute of american studies told a seminar 
marking the anniversary 
for decades after the communists came to power in 1949 the 
united states recognized their defeated rivals the nationalists on 
taiwan as chinas government ideological suspicion was reinforced 
when the chinese communists and united states found themselves on 
opposite sides in the 195053 korean war 
in 1972 president richard nixon made a dramatic trip to beijing 
and began a process of drawing closer to china that culminated on 
dec 15 1978 when president jimmy carter signed an accord 
recognizing the communist government 
the agreement took effect jan 1 1979 
since then the united states has become chinas secondlargest 
trading partner after japan with 1988 trade projected at more than 
135 billion more than 50000 chinese will travel to the united 
states in 1988 lord told the seminar thursday and about 300000 
americans will visit china 
hundreds of cultural and scientific exchanges have taken place in 
addition to regular visits by senior government officials 
however ms zi said china remains unhappy over us failure to 
press taiwan to enter into reunification talks with the mainland 
she also repeated chinas frequent charges of us trade 
protectionism and criticized us use of technology transfer to 
impose pressure on china 
last year the united states froze for months its liberalization 
of technology transfers to china to protest chinas use of force in 
suppressing proindependence demonstrations in tibet in the last 14 
months 
in his speech lord said us concern for human rights is 
natural and universal we do not single out china he reiterated 
that the united states recognizes chinas sovereignty over tibet but 
pressed for greater access to the region by foreign journalists 
washington has not commented on the latest clash between chinese 
police and tibetan activists in which police on saturday fatally 
shot at least two people and injured 13 
china says its rule over tibet dates to the 13th century tibetan 
activists claim their remote region was effectively independent from 
china for centuries before chinese communist troops entered in 1950

a prosecutor ordered a 41yearold swede 
held in custody thursday in the slaying of prime minister olof 
palme signaling what could be a major break in swedens crime of 
the century 
the man detained wednesday is suspected of having murdered olof 
palme jorgen almblad spokesman for the prosecutors office told 
swedish radio 
swedens strict press and libel law forbids publication of a 
suspects name but he was identified in public records as christer 
pettersson 
palme a fourterm social democratic prime minister who 
championed international peace and disarmament issues was killed 
the night of feb 28 1986 while walking home unguarded with his 
wife from a downtown movie theater 
the killing jolted a nation which prides itself on orderliness 
and had seen little of the political violence and terrorism that 
plague other countries 
pettersson has a history of violent crime and a previous 
conviction of manslaughter he has been interrogated since he was 
detained wednesday 
the suspicions from yesterday remain said almblad 
a witness identified the man as someone who waited outside the 
grand theater where palme had been just before he was fatally shot 
the radio reported without identifying its source it said there 
were discrepancies between witness accounts and the suspects alibi 
the killer followed palme down the street after the prime 
minister left the theater and shot him with a 357 magnum revolver 
which has not been found 
before wednesday police were unable to produce a solid lead or a 
motive in the killing despite the largest manhunt in swedish 
history and a reward of 8 million the investigation was marred by 
squabbling between police and prosecutors and the chief detective 
in the case was replaced twice government commissions accused 
police of incompetence in the investigation 
thursdays move means that prosecutors feel they have enough 
evidence to build a case against the man and may hold him 
indefinitely although his attorney may dispute the remand order in 
stockholm district court on friday 
there is reason to believe it will be a difficult case said 
arne liljeros the public defender assigned to the case my client 
denies it says its a mistake he said in a television interview 
a friend of the suspect said the man was a member of the sweden 
party an ultrarightist group that advocates white supremacy the 
national news agency tt reported but police have not linked him 
with the party the report said 
he didnt like palme he was angry at him the unidentified 
friend was quoted as saying 
authorities have refused to give details of their case but 
swedish police reporters were given access to the suspects file 
reports said he had 63 convictions for various offenses and had 
spent the last 22 years in and out of prisons and phychiatric wards 
he was convicted of fatally stabbing an alleged drug addict with 
a bayonet in 1970 just a few yards from the site of the palme 
killing 
almblad said the suspect had been under investigation for a 
long time but declined to give further details the man had been 
questioned in 1986 but was not arrested because his alibi appeared 
sound at the time according to tt

the two airlines that dominate chicagos ohare 
airport agreed thursday on flight schedule changes aimed at reducing 
the number of delays in and out of the airport next spring the 
federal aviation administration said 
after two days of meetings american airlines and united airlines 
agreed to stagger and more evenly distribute flights at ohare the 
busiest airport in the nation especially during heavy travel 
periods in the evening officials said 
were pleased with the adjustments which should provide a 
substantial reduction in delays weve been experiencing at 
chicago said faa spokesman dick stafford 
most of the adjustments will go into effect march 1 when the 
airlines put their spring schedules into place 
the discussions under the direction of the faa were being 
conducted at a hotel near washington 
flight delays have increased at ohare in recent months after the 
faa reduced the maximum number of flights allowed each hour at the 
airport the flight restrictions were imposed because of concern 
that air traffic controllers were being asked to handle too many 
planes 
there has been a sharp increase in controller errors involving 
air traffic in the chicago area this year 
american and united together have about 60 percent of the flights 
at ohare 
stafford said the adjustments agreed upon by the two airlines 
will be closely watched by the faa when they go into effect if we 
find out the agreement isnt working well call the carriers back 
in again he said

organizers of the oneday general strike 
that jolted spain to a standstill demanded on thursday that prime 
minister felipe gonzalez give workers and the poor a bigger share of 
the countrys growing prosperity 
nicolas redondo head of the general workers union told 
reporters that wednesdays 24hour strike was a victory for all of 
spanish society 
the government has to be sensitive to the demands of the union 
movement it should not underestimate what has happened or try to 
fool itself he said 
his union is a centuryold ally of gonzalezs governing socialist 
party 
in a statement thursday the prime minister acknowledged the 
political success of the strike and admitted it represented a 
tough political blow for the government 
the unions estimate that 78 million of spains 118 million 
employed stayed off the job to protest austere economic policies 
gonzalez said the government would give its view of the strike in 
parliament next wednesday and seek a first meeting with union 
leaders the following day 
but government spokeswoman rosa conde said the governments 
position will not vary substantially 
the general workers union joined the communistdominated workers 
commissions to organize the strike after talks with the government 
broke down a month ago over demands for more pay unemployment 
benefits and pensions 
redondo warned that the two unions will organize more strikes and 
demonstrations if the government fails to satisfy their demands 
redondo and secretarygeneral antonio gutierrez of the workers 
commissions told reporters the government must accept the unions 
basic demands prior to their entering wideranging negotiations on 
economic policies repeatedly offered by gonzalez 
these include wage and pension demands expanded unemployment 
benefits granting civil servants collective bargaining rights and 
withdrawing a youth employment plan the unions reject as 
exploitative 
the unions have denounced gonzalez antiinflation highgrowth 
economic policies which caused a boom in the last three years they 
complain that the policies failed to reduce unemployment which at 
187 percent remains the highest in europe 
redondo said it was time to compensate workers and the poor for 
sacrifices the unions contend made the boom possible

the energy department came under criticism 
thursday from an illinois congressman who said the department wasted 
15 million by mailing a 26pound 23volume report on the 
superconducting super collider to 16000 people sometimes sending 
four to a family 
a department spokesman jeff sherwood disputed the figures cited 
by rep dennis hastert rill saying the report actually went to 
about 17000 people and cost 13 million 
this is crazy said hastert whose district includes one of 
the rejected sites for the collider its just a lack of common 
sense 
the document at issue is an 8000page environmental impact 
statement on possible sites for the 44 billion atom smasher in 
arizona colorado illinois michigan north carolina tennessee and 
texas 
energy secretary john herrington announced nov 10 that texas 
would house the project a 53mile underground ring of magnets 
which would whip proton beams together with 20 times the force of 
the most powerful existing atom smasher 
scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from 
studying subatomic particles created by the proton collisions 
the department sent copies of the environmental statement to 
everyone who testified at hearings on the project or submitted 
written comments on any of the seven finalist sites sherwood said 
it is government practice that both draft and final documents 
be made available to interested parties as part of the environmental 
review process he explained in order to comply with that 
process the department mailed that document out 
however hastert said an expensive mailing went far beyond the 
requirement that agencies keep people involved in the siteselection 
process 
the law says people have to be contacted they dont have to 
send all this stuff he said if the department sent a letter 
with a reply card maybe theyd get 1 percent that would want the 
report then just making them available in libraries would be 
enough 
why not do that were scrimping to cut spending by pennies 
dimes and nickles in congress theyre spending almost 1 million 
here when we could be using that money to build highways or feed 
the homeless what a waste 
sherwood acknowledged that the mailing might alienate members of 
congress who will decide whether to appropriate money for the 
collider 
i understand where the argument is coming from i dont know 
who made the ultimate decision he said but if we hadnt 
distributed the report we would have been criticized for that as 
well

more than 150 nicaraguan refugees are living in the 
locker rooms of a miami stadium after their threeroom shelter was 
closed by the city because it was overcrowded 
i saw three four people sleeping on top of each other at the 
house of love and hope said miami city manager cesar odio after a 
tuesday night inspection i was horrified 
the privately run shelter was shut down wednesday for alleged 
unsanitary conditions and violations of miami zoning laws vans and 
buses moved the 157 refugees to the bobby maduro miami stadium 
there was no word on how long the refugees would be allowed to stay 
at the stadium 
the action was the first time miami officials have stepped in to 
handle the growing influx of nicaraguan refugees who have been 
moving to the city since the sandinista revolution in 1979 
the exodus has picked up speed in the past few months with 
thousands of nicaraguans pouring across the border many from 
mexico and finding their way to miami 
some resented the move to the stadium theyre moving us like 
animals said magda pavon who has been in miami two months 
others were pleased with the space and bath facilities at their 
new quarters i feel theyre helping us said julia armas 
the shelter had been cited for code violations several times 
since it opened in august but officials had given shelter founder 
cristobal mendoza extensions to search for better quarters 
us immigration and naturalization service officials estimate 
300 nicaraguans a week have been settling in dade county since the 
summer 
the city manager told nicaraguans that their problem was similar 
to the problem facing mariel refugees eight years ago 
when 125000 mariel refugees arrived in florida in 1980 they 
were processed in the orange bowl and a tent city was erected to 
house them under an interstate 95 
we need to work with you in the same way said odio who 
helped direct the mariel relief effort

top energy department officials will meet 
here with the governors of three western states friday in an attempt 
to resolve an impasse over storage of radioactive wastes from 
nuclear weapons plants 
the governors of idaho colorado and new mexico said they want to 
hear proposals to solve the problem when they meet with joseph 
salgado chief deputy to energy secretary john herrington and other 
regional doe officials 
the immediate problem is to find a storage site for seven boxcars 
of radioactive material and enough additional waste to fill 17 
more sitting outside the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant near 
denver 
the other question is when the federal government will open its 
waste isolation pilot plant a prototype for permanent waste storage 
facilities under construction in southwestern new mexico 
doug elmet a spokesman for the doe in washington said thursday 
the purpose of the meeting was to provide a chance for some 
straight talk between the governors and the federal government 
but the governors said they hope federal officials will have an 
answer to the problem 
ive got all the information i need what i need now is for 
them to come and say we have got our act together idaho gov 
cecil andrus said at a thursday news conference they should come 
with a proposal that the three governors can deal with 
waste has been stacking up at rocky flats which manufactures 
plutonium components for nuclear weapons since october when andrus 
turned away a boxcar headed for the idaho national engineering 
laboratory and said the state would accept no more shipments 
andrus said he would not open the laboaratory to additional 
shipments until the pilot plant is opened and doe has outlined a 
plan to remove existing waste from idaho since the ban was imposed 
he said there has been no progress for two months which tells me 
i was right to put my foot down 
colorado gov roy romer said he would require rocky flats to 
suspend production once its temporary storage capacity is filled 
romer said during a news conference thursday that he would not 
consider a 90day extension that would permit doe to keep waste 
beyond the plants capacity 
if they dont have a solution they are going to have to close 
it by failing to act romer said i do not want a de facto dump 
here thats why ive kept that storage in those boxcars 
romer said he did not expect an immediate solution to the rocky 
flats problem but said he hoped the doe would put some alternate 
solutions on the table 
don caviness spokesman for new mexico gov garrey carruthers 
said his boss wanted the department of energy to provide a firm 
deadline for opening the pilot plant and an update on the progress 
of some 240 million in mitigation funds the state has been 
promised under an agreement signed between the state and doe eight 
years ago new mexico is to receive 190 million to build bypasses 
around major cities through which waste would be shipped and 50 
million to compensate for lost mining royalties 
caviness said carruthers would not permit the pilot plant to open 
until those pledges are fulfilled 
the doe is in the awkward position the governor is not going 
to have the wipp site open until the terms are met new mexico has 
no intention of rolling over because the governors of other states 
have problems said caviness

bilking 31000 men out of 45 million with phony stories of a 
retreat inhabited by nude love angels went to a jury thursday 
in closing arguments defense attorneys told the jurors that 
defendants donald lowry 59 and pamala st charles 25 are two 
of the nicest people youll ever meet

st charles his assistant defrauded lonely men with a mailorder

letters for contributions to a nonexistent rural church paradise

needs including garden seeds winter coats and sewing machines

argument that the defendants were con artists but defense attorney 
william g schick argued the church was a legitimate business and 
described lowry and ms st clair as two of the nicest people who 
care more about others than anyone youll ever meet 
prosecutors said wednesday that ms st charles wrote to church 
members telling them not to cooperate with a federal investigation 
why should you cooperate with them when it is to their 
advantage only ms st charles wrote in the letter introduced in 
court they are the enemy 
the letter was sent to church of love members who attended a 
november 1986 convention called the gathering which was held in 
a chicago hotel prosecutors said 
under questioning from her attorney william g schick of moline 
ms st charles said she wasnt trying to block the investigation 
but was concerned that investigators may have given false 
information about the church to members 
ms st charles and lowry are charged with conspiracy mail fraud 
and unlawful use of funds fraudulently obtained through the col corp 
she and lowry now operate the international order of knights a 
mail order operation that clearly states that its letters from 
fantasy girls are fictional

a 200 million drop in west virginia 
investment funds are actual dollar losses not interest and 
resulted from poor sales state treasury officials said thursday 
as jittery local governments continued to pull their money from 
the state investment pool treasury officials said they sold off 30 
million worth of securities early to satisfy a run on the investment 
account 
in addition treasurer a james manchin said the man in charge of 
investments at the time of the 1987 loss former associate 
treasurer arnold t margolin was warned by his staff about the bad 
investments but did nothing to halt them 
the loss was not revealed until this week and the news has 
spurred a fourday run by local and county governments on the 
states consolidated investment fund in which state agencies and 
local governments place money for investment by the state 
the local governments pulled out another 37 million thursday 
bringing to 146 million the investment fund withdrawals since 
monday about half of what the agencies had invested 
assistant treasurer charles capet said 30 million worth of 
securities was sold at a loss to raise the funds needed to pay the 
local governments the state also sold other matured securities and 
all its interest earnings were used to meet the demand its a day 
to day thing capet said 
from the newspaper reports that ive seen and the lack of an 
explanation from those in charge our money would be at risk in the 
account if we were to wait for an explanation said jefferson 
county administrator david ash whose county commission thursday 
withdrew the 16 million it had in the investment fund 
manchin who is in charge of the investment fund said he 
suspects no wrongdoing in the loss 
it was just bad investments he said thursday 
the treasurer has asked the us attorneys office and state 
officials to investigate the loss however us attorney michael 
carey directed manchins request to the fbi which has not decided 
whether to investigate 
at manchins request the private accounting firm of touche ross 
amp co is investigating the loss 
margolin who submitted his resignation last month to join the 
staff of govelect gaston caperton as chief financial adviser has 
said he is awaiting the results of the touche ross investigation 
before commenting 
manchin has refused to accept margolins resignation until the 
matter is cleared up he has challenged margolin to reveal publicly 
what happened since margolin said he has explained the situation to 
caperton 
he was the man directly responsible manchin said of 
margolin if arnie explained it to caperton why doesnt he 
explain it to the people this is strange silence hes hiding 
behind the governorelect 
but caperton spokesman steve cohen quoted margolin as saying that 
he notified manchin as soon as he discovered the losses the 
governorelect said he retains the fullest confidence in 
margolin 
assistant treasurer charles capet said the bad investments were 
made over a 6 to 8month period he said the assets were purchased 
at a high price and sold at a lower price 
former assistant treasurer kathy lester who actually made the 
investments under margolin was quoted in the charleston gazette on 
thursday as saying that she was retaining a lawyer and would have no 
comment 
assistant treasurer mary hudson who now is in charge of 
investments said the consolidated investment fund this week totaled 
1572 billion or 208 million less than last december the fund 
was 24 billion at the end of 1986

said im glad it worked im not a trained hostage negotiator 
warren murphy 39 gave himself up in the main new orleans post 
office shortly after 9 am and released his hostage 29yearold

during the siege which began about 830 pm wednesday were not 
seriously wounded officials said 
woodfork who negotiated with murphy for about two hours said he 
knew the gunman because their sons had played football together 
he said murphy was concerned about a marital breakup and the 
welfare of his children who reportedly were in his estranged wifes 
custody in washington 
fbi spokeswoman nancy fisher identified smith also a postal 
employee as murphys girlfriend 
he wasnt angry at her fisher said he was upset over a 
family matter after the shooting started he just grabbed her 
volney hayes an fbi spokesman said murphy after arriving for 
work wednesday evening pulled a birdshotloaded shotgun out of a 
bag and started shooting

after eluding police for five hours the gunman was cornered with 
his hostage in a windowless coffee break room with a single door

more gunfire erupted sporadically through the night when murphy 
apparently became frustrated hayes said no one was hurt he said 
they were just random shots he said they havent been at 
anyone just stick the barrel under the door and fire 
once it was apparent there was no danger to people outside the 
building police lifted roadblocks around the building allowing 
rush hour traffic to proceed on the busy streets surrounding the 
post office 
hayes said murphy made his only demand about 9 am telling 
negotiators he wanted to see no news reporters 
a few minutes later murphy surrendered 
i told him id meet him halfway and when he walked out i was 
there woodfork said he had thrown the shotgun out 
postal inspector don durken said he didnt know how murphy got 
the gun into the post office 
most of our entrances are secured said durken but its a 
big building the loading docks are open at times unless you had 
someone every 20 feet it would be hard to make sure nothing ever 
got through

presidentelect bush will name onetime rival 
rep jack kemp of new york as secretary of housing and urban 
development and was poised to make a decision on former sen john 
tower as defense secretary sources said thursday 
sources close to both kemp and the vice president said kemp had 
accepted the job after meeting with bush on wednesday and that the 
hud announcement could come either friday or monday 
meanwhile tower was tentatively set to talk with bush on friday 
a final fbi background check on the former chairman of the senate 
armed services committee was presented to the vice president on 
thursday 
transition officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said the lengthy background check did not uncover any problems that 
would hurt towers chances for senate confirmation 
kemp 53 a former professional football quarterback who has 
championed conservative causes was a distant alsoran in the 
republican primaries last winter he was an original sponsor of the 
1981 tax cut legislation later endorsed by president reagan and is 
an ardent advocate of free enterprise and government deregulation 
kemp has called for housing vouchers for the poor and allowing 
tenants of public housing to purchase their units at low cost as 
part of his urban redevelopment proposals 
meanwhile bush moved closer to filling two other cabinet 
appointments transition sources said 
bush met privately with dr louis sullivan a black medical 
school chief and contender for secretary of health and human 
services and was on the verge of naming samuel skinner as secretary 
of transportation according to the sources 
gary macdougal a chicago business executive and bush transition 
adviser also has emerged as a top candidate for secretary of labor 
sources said 
the sources who commented only on condition they not be 
identified said bush may fill some of the eight remaining vacancies 
in his cabinet on friday 
he has filled six cabinet departments so far and has said he 
wants to finish before christmas 
transition legal counsel c boyden gray delivered his final 
background report on tower to bush on thursday 
bush has delayed a decision on whether to name tower 63 defense 
secretary pending completion of an extensive fbi investigation of 
the former texas senators background including an acrimonious 
divorce 
sullivan is not the only black reportedly under consideration for 
the bush cabinet which already includes a hispanic lauro f 
cavazos the holdover secretary of education retired army gen 
julius w becton jr who now runs the federal emergency management 
agency is in the running to head the new department of veterans 
affairs 
bush told reporters only that he had a very good meeting with 
sullivan 
transition sources said sullivan 55 president of morehouse 
school of medicine in atlanta assured bush at the meeting that he 
shared the vice presidents antiabortion views 
bush and sullivan are friends he accompanied bush on a trip to 
south africa in 1982 and barbara bush serves on the morehouse board 
of trustees sullivan introduced the future first lady at the 
republican convention in new orleans last august 
although transition officials formally said there was no final 
decision on the hhs post bush has made a practice of meeting with 
his prospective cabinet choice shortly before an announcement 
skinner 50 is chairman of the regional transportation authority 
of northeastern illinois 
bush said wednesday that he expects to name a black to his 
cabinet 
at a photo opportunity before meeting with transition advisers 
and talent scouts the vice president brushed aside a question about 
whether he may appoint two blacks to the cabinet 
dont believe all the rumors that are around just wait to have 
an announcement said bush who also told reporters that after the 
transition he wont allow questions at picturetaking sessions 
talking at photo ops will continue until jan 20 and after that 
there will be absolutely none bush said and then ill have 
other ways of communicating that will be much more pleasant for you 
and much more pleasant for me and much more respectful of our guests 
like foreign visitors 
he said the current practice of trying to sandwich in questions 
during picturetaking sessions was demeaning to your profession 
macdougal 52 former chairman of mark controls corp is 
reportedly among four candidates on a short list for the labor job 
along with washington labor lawyer william kilberg patricia diaz 
dennis a member of the federal communications commission and frank 
doyle a senior vice president for general electric constance 
horner the head of the office of personnel management has faded as 
a top contender administration sources said 
gray the transition lawyer said background checks now are under 
way on candidates for subcabinet jobs 
as for tower gray said he did not know whether bush would ask 
him to pursue further any aspect of the extensive checking already 
completed 
one of the leading proponents of the strategic defense 
initiative retired lt gen daniel o graham said thursday he 
opposes a tower nomination because the former senate armed services 
committee chairman is not for sdi 
graham founder of high frontier a lobbying group for the 
spacebased missile shield said tower would be in the pocket of 
the joint chiefs of staff and would sacrifice sdi to preserve 
weapons in the pentagon arsenal he predicted tower would not get 
the job mainly because hes carrying so much baggage around on his 
back

palestinians the arab world generally and many other countries 
said thursday the us decision to talk with the plo may bring new 
life to stagnant middle east peace negotiations 
i could scream and cry and say happy new peaceful era arabs 
and israelis said nawal saadi 44 a pharmacist whose family 
fled israeliheld jerusalem for amman jordan 
mrs saadi one of 15 million palestinians in jordan wept as 
she said israel has to know that arabs and especially 
palestinians are for peace and the wise us decision does not mean 
israel will be thrown into the sea we want to live in peace and 
share the same land 
mohammed milhem a former palestinian mayor who was expelled from 
the israelioccupied west bank said wednesdays announcement was 
a great step by a great nation 
one of the major roadblocks has now been removed to convening 
an international conference and the peaceful coexistence between 
all peoples and all religions and all states milhem former mayor 
of halhoul and a member of the plos ruling executive committee 
said in amman 
some radical factions of the palestine liberation organization 
also hailed the us decision 
kays alsamarai spokesman for the marxist democratic front for 
the liberation of palestine called it a new victory for the plo 
and for the intefadeh the yearold palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
george habash leader of the radical popular front for the 
liberation of palestine called it a victory for the uprising even 
though the us administration says that initiating the dialogue 
does not entail recognition of palestinian rights to an 
independent state 
palestinians declared an independent state last month 
habashs statement referred to israel instead of the 
zionist entity the phrase his group and other factions 
traditionally have used to describe the jewish state 
in israel foreign minister shimon peres said it was sad day 
for all of us 
president reagan said in washington that the move was just 
another step in the middle east peace process and israel should 
not worry about the us commitment to its security 
in the west bank and gaza delighted palestinans marched in the 
streets to celebrate 
some palestinians opposed the concessions made by plo chairman 
yasser arafat such as renouncing terrorism and recognizing israels 
right to exist which effectively denies many palestinians the dream 
of returning someday to their homes 
armed struggle is our only option palestine is for the 
palestinian people and not for israel said hassan daher a 
22yearold student at the arab university of beirut 
president hosni mubarak of egypt and king hussein of jordan 
praised the us decision and predicted it will lead to an 
international conference on middle east peace 
mubarak said the decision was a beginning but israel must 
withdraw from the west bank and gaza and allow establishment of a 
palestinian state he accused prime minister yitzhak shamir who 
opposes an international conference of delaying peace efforts 
egypts leading newspaper the stateowned al ahram said the 
us announcement came hours after mubarak telephoned secretary of 
state george p shultz to urge him to take a positive attitude 
toward the constructive decisions of the plo 
hussein after meeting with mubarak in cairo and said i 
believe the ice has been broken i believe the peace process has 
begun and we hope to see it accelerate in the near future 
later in a satellite tv interview with cbs evening news 
hussein said americans should understand that the palestinians and 
their representatives have opted for peace i know arafat to be a 
man who is determined to stand by his word in renouncing terrorism 
thats good enough for me 
khaled musamer a plo spokesman in amman noted that the 
americans said the talks would start at a low level but added we 
hope it will be more than that after the first meeting and 
especially under the new american president 
in britain prime minister margaret thatcher said arafats recent 
statements qualified the plo to take part in a peace conference 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said later in a british 
broadcasting corp interview there has been courage and clarity 
from the palestinian side we must now look for the same kind of 
response from israel 
president francois mitterrand of france said the decision has 
brought peace in the region a step closer 
japan welcomed the us declaration as an important step toward 
progress 
prime minister ciriaco de mita of italy who was visiting 
washington concurred and vatican radio called the american 
decision a sign that the force of reason begins to prevail 
the governments of belgium greece australia and east germany 
were among those praising the action 
holland said it would send a delegation of senior diplomats to 
tunis tunisia for talks with the plo and the european parliament 
urged member nations to recognize the plo as a palestinian 
governmentinexile

a federal panel on thursday recommended a 
temporary halt to the let it burn policy in national parks and 
wilderness areas to make sure everybody understands what the policy 
means 
in a report to the secretaries of agriculture and interior the 
advisory panel said current policies permitting fires to burn under 
predetermined conditions are sound but the policies themselves 
need to be refined strengthened and reaffirmed 
until the moratorium is lifted fires will be put out officials 
said 
no natural fires are to be allowed until fire management 
plans meet these standards the report said 
charles philpot cochairman of the review panel told reporters 
he expected the moratorium would be finished by the beginning of 
the western fire season which is the middle of may 
philpot is a former forest service official who is now special 
assistant to the deputy secretary of agriculture 
the secretaries of interior and agriculture appointed the 
committee in september after the worst fire season in history in 
wyomings yellowstone national park some 249 fires in and near the 
park prompted complaints from residents and their representatives in 
congress that their communities were being ruined by smoke and the 
collapse of tourism 
the panel reviewed fire management policy on all federal lands 
not just yellowstone the panel said it found that some plans did 
not spell out the conditions under which natural fires would be 
allowed to burn 
some plans also did not consider values at risk outside of 
parks and wilderness and the number of fires that can be managed at 
one time and cumulative effects of drought 
the panels other cochairman brad leonard deputy director of 
the interior departments office of program analysis estimated that 
twentyfive to 30 percent of the plans have some shortcomings 
some of them are minor 
the interior department contains the national park service and 
the agriculture department contains the forest service which 
supervises many wilderness areas and manages much national forest 
land adjacent to yellowstone 
interiors bureau of land management fish and wildlife service 
and bureau of indian affairs also manage affected lands 
the agencies insist they dont have let it burn policies but 
rather let it burn if it meets our criteria policies 
the report said the agencies reject as impractical and 
unprofessional the practice that fires can be allowed to burn free 
of conditions laid down in advance or appropriate suppression 
action it said some employees essentially had advocated that policy 
as long as fire didnt escape the agencys land 
the report said interior and agriculture agencies should make 
sure that fire management plans conform to departmental policies 
that employees understand the policies that everybody is using a 
common vocabulary and that agencies have agreed beforehand what to 
do if fires threaten to move across administrative boundaries 
denis galvin deputy director of the park service said his 
agency had had the report for 24 hours and would be submitting 
comments to the two secretaries 
i dont see it as a major shift galvin said its clear 
well do more around developed areas in deliberately set fires to 
clear firebreaks or other techniques 
the report which will remain open for public comment for 60 
days recommended more research on when deliberately set fires can 
be used and how to use them in lodgepole pine forests the dominant 
kind in yellowstone 
many people interviewed said this technique should be available 
for all federal land though it has been little used in yellowstone 
and practically never in lodgepole because of the difficulty of 
controlling it 
the fires in yellowstone were particularly intense because of 
more than a centurys buildup of dead trees and other matter on the 
forest floor 
there is little agreement on whether management objectives can 
be achieved through planned ignitions when they result in high 
intensity crown fire the report said 
bill linenesch of the national parks and conservation association 
said he saw no reason why all parks should be barred from letting 
fires burn until every management plan had been approved 
the lesson of the summer is that you cannot choreograph 
nature said dave simon of the association

us ambassador robert h pelletreau jr 
who once was held hostage by palestinians telephoned plo 
headquarters thursday to make the first official contact of a new 
dialogue for middle east peace 
pelletreau who escaped from his terrorist captors in 1970 held 
a brief conversation with a palestine liberation organization 
official at their tunis headquarters according to us embassy 
spokesman adnan siddiqi and the plo 
siddiqi did not identify the palestinian or say what was 
discussed he said he did not know when to expect the first 
facetoface meeting of what secretary of state george p shultz 
calls a substantive dialogue 
palestinian sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
plo delegation at the first meeting probably will be led by 
executive committee members abdallah hourani and yasser abdrabbou 
state department officials said the talks probably would begin 
friday afternoon 
plo chairman yasser arafat met east german leader erich honecker 
and other officials in berlin on thursday then headed to romania 
east germany was one of the first countries to recognize an 
independent palestinian state it was not known when arafat intended 
to return to tunis 
on wednesday night shultz announced that arafats recent 
statements renouncing terrorism and recognizing israels right to 
exist opened the way for talks with us officials he designated 
pelletreau as the us governments only authorized channel of 
communication 
we hope that that dialogue may help bring about direct 
negotiations that will lead to peace shultz said how those 
negotiations are structured who is there to speak on behalf of the 
palestinians is a subject thats a difficult one 
the plo recognized by the united nations and especially arab 
states as the sole legitimate representative of palestinians has 
its political headquarters in tunis capital of the arab nation of 
tunisia 
abu yahia plo political director confirmed by telephone that 
the conversation with pelletreau really took place but he 
declined to identify the official who spoke to the ambassador 
in washington an american official said pelletreau called the 
directorgeneral of the plo political section to try to arrange 
talks it was not clear whether he was referring to abu yahia 
were sure the plo will try hard to have them take place as 
soon as possible said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity another official said the first meeting certainly would 
come within days 
pelletreau who has been ambassador to tunisia since march 1987 
is one of the most experienced and knowledgeable american diplomats 
on arab affairs 
the 53yearold native of patchogue ny speaks arabic and 
french and has served in algeria morocco mauritania lebanon 
jordan and syria he once was ambassador to bahrain 
from 1985 until going to tunis in 1987 pelletreau was deputy 
assistant secretary of defense for middle east and south asian 
affairs 
his first encounter with palestinian terrorism came in september 
1970 when guerrillas of george habashs extremist plo faction 
diverted three airliners to amman jordan and took the passengers 
and crews hostage 
colleagues say pelletreau enjoys describing how he outwitted 
captors who kidnapped him on the streets of amman and took him with 
the other hostages to a a downtown hotel news conference seeing his 
captors were not attentive pelletreau edged in among the 
journalists 
he was standing there as the press conference was going on and 
he just walked away he bears them no ill will it was a great 
adventure a us diplomat said on condition of anonymity 
those were in the innocent days he recalled its almost 
hard to remember the days when you just didnt kill diplomats

the house of the secondranking 
official in the us embassy was attacked with grenades last month 
the embassy reported thursday 
neither david dlouhy the deputy chief of mission nor any of his 
family members or domestic employees was injured in the nov 25 
nighttime attack 
embassy spokesman joseph mcmanus told the associated press that 
men traveling in two cars through the affluent neighborhood of 
maquilishuat threw several grenades and that two landed at the wall 
surrounding dlouhys house 
mcmanus said the two grenades caused some material damage but no 
injuries 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said one 
of the explosives bounced off the top of the wall into the yard 
a woman was wounded by shrapnel from another grenade thrown 
farther down the road according to newspaper reports published in 
the days after the attack those reports did not mention the attack 
on dlouhys home 
no group claimed responsibility for the maquilishuat attack 
because other grenades were thrown at other homes it was unclear if 
the attackers considered dlouhys house their specific target 
four days after the attack leftist guerrillas briefly took over 
two san salvador radio stations to broadcast a statement saying us 
embassy officials and us buildings were considered legitimate 
targets in the 9yearold civil war 
the centrist governments war effort is funded by the united 
states 
the guerrillas on their clandestine radio station previously 
made similar statements 
the wall around the offices of the us agency for international 
development was struck by a rocketpropelled grenade in october

israeli leaders responded with anger and dismay 
thursday to the us declaration that it will talk with the plo a 
stunning reversal of policy to which they were given no time to 
object 
some israelis were left with a sense of betrayal by the way the 
announcement was handled others said the dialogue with the 
palestine liberation organization is doomed to collapse 
we believe that the united states will discover very soon the 
true face of the plo and will realize that it cannot be a partner 
for negotiations and peace said avi pazner spokesman for prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
according to the daily haaretz shamir was considering a 
unilateral israeli step that will make the us decision fade 
the initiative amounted to granting a limited selfrule to 15 
million palestinians in the israelioccupied lands haaretz said in 
a frontpage report in its friday editions 
the daily hadashot described washingtons decision as the most 
painful diplomatic slap in the face that israel has received since 
its establishment we have been left alone to face the entire 
world 
israeli officials said they were notified only 30 minutes before 
secretary of state george p shultz made the announcement which 
allowed no time for an attempt to dissuade the americans 
analysts said israel will face mounting pressure for a favorable 
response to the plo and delay could endanger relations with 
washington which is its main ally and provides 3 billion a year in 
aid 
if us talks with the plo succeed pressure would grow for 
israel to accept a unsponsored peace conference which many 
israelis see as a forum for demanding unreasonable concessions from 
the jewish state 
a conference probably would consider such issues as the israeli 
settlements that dot the occupied territories return of the 
territories the status of jerusalem and the central question of an 
independent palestinian state 
an example of what israel considers unreasonable was a provision 
in a un general assembly resolution passed thursday for un 
supervision of the occupied territories and jerusalem which israel 
has declared its capital 
such rightwing leaders as yitzhak modai of the likud bloc said 
israel was prepared to take the heat 
the united states wants to speak to the plo but this doesnt 
require us to speak with the plo modai said the united states 
can advise us and even pressure us here and there but we have to 
know how to withstand the pressures 
palestinians called the us decision a victory of their yearold 
uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip in which more 
than 320 palestinians and 13 israelis have been killed 
yossi benaharon a senior aide to shamir told foreign reporters 
there could be no solutions to palestinian problems without israel 
they are still where they were in the camps he said we 
are still running the show their lot has not changed by this 
american move the agent to bring about change is israel and 
nothing can be done by bypassing israel 
shultz sent an explanatory message to shamir and foreign minister 
shimon peres the leaders of israels caretaker government 
a text released by israeli officials said i know how sensitive 
an issue this is for you and the people of israel the dialogue that 
is about to be launched is not an end in itself it must focus on 
the core issue of negotiations to end the arafatisraeli conflict 
us ambassador thomas pickering passed on oral assurances that 
the united states was not recognizing plo claims to an independent 
state israel army radio called shamirs talk with pickering a 
hard and unpleasant one 
pickering said ties with israel are stronger than ever but 
he said israelis and palestinians must make difficult concessions 
for peace 
shamir the head of likud made no comment thursday but pazner 
said we regret this american decision very much he said 
israel would not reconsider its refusal to deal with the plo which 
it calls a terrorist organization 
dozens of jewish settlers from the territories began a hunger 
strike pitching tents in front of shamirs office 
the us policy of recognizing the plo is the seed of the next 
war said ron nachman a settler leader israel cannot reach 
agreement with the plo there is no common ground and the result 
will be an explosion 
peres leader of the centerleft labor party and shamirs 
political rival said of plo chairman yasser arafats renunciation 
of terrorism 
i surely see a change in their rhetoric i hardly see a change 
in their actions this is the discrepancy that worries me 
he said israel was facing a new situation and proposed an 
alternative that elections be held in the west bank and gaza to 
choose palestinian leaders for peace negotiations 
ezer weizman a labor member of the cabinet without portfolio 
said arafats recognition of israel and renunciation of terrorism 
made the plo a satisfactory partner for talks 
i think a new era has opened he said

the government proposed new laws thursday to 
prevent employers in northern ireland from discriminating on the 
basis of religion but said threats of disinvestment could only 
produce greater misery 
i have made absolutely clear that there is to be no 
discrimination of any sort in northern ireland said northern 
ireland secretary tom king britains top official in the province 
the bill whose passage is assured because of the governing 
conservatives huge majority in parliament would force companies to 
report regularly on how many catholics and protestants they employ 
it would order them if necessary to change their employment 
practices and levy fines of up to 55000 on employers who dont 
the measures due to take effect next summer stopped short of 
imposing hiring quotas for the 40 percent catholic minority but 
they mark the toughest attempt to end job discrimination in the 
british province 
despite longtime bans on overt religious discrimination in jobs 
catholic unemployment runs at 17 percent 2 times the protestant 
rate 
the new moves appear to have been spurred partly by threats of 
disinvestment from the united states 
eight american states have endorsed fair employment principles 
put forward in 1984 by the late irish statesman sean macbride he 
called for ending investment in companies in northern ireland 
accused of religious bias 
the disinvestment lobby is headed by irishamerican legislators 
and pressure groups american investment accounts for nearly 14 
percent of the jobs in northern ireland 
there is absolutely no way in which this legislation is 
designed to see protestants being dismissed for catholics to take 
their place king told reporters this is about recruitment 
seeing that there is equality of opportunity 
he said the only way to improve employment opportunities for 
catholics was to create more jobs and he called the disinvestment 
program in the united states a very negative campaign 
were getting more jobs into northern ireland and that combined 
with effective legislation is the real hope for catholics of a 
fairer situation king said there is no hope for catholics in 
any policy that leads to disinvestment in northern ireland which 
leads to greater misery for all 
more than 2700 people have been killed since political and 
sectarian violence broke out in northern ireland in 1969 after 
several years of civil rights campaigning by catholics 
under the new laws all companies with more than 25 employees 
and later with 10 or more will have to submit reports at least 
once every three years on the religious composition of the work 
force to a new body the fair employment commission 
failure to submit a report or comply with the commission will be 
a criminal offense carrying a fine of up to 55000 
the laws would also ban indirect discrimination in hiring 
practices such as getting workers to find new workers or taking 
recruits from a single school nearly all catholic and protestant 
children are educated separately 
public and private companies with more than 250 employees also 
will have to monitor their job applications as well as the 
composition of their work force

a man imprisoned 20 years ago in the 
poisoning deaths of his seven children asked for a new trial 
thursday telling the florida supreme court he was framed 
attorneys for james richardson said the prosecutors and the 
sheriff involved in his conviction time should be charged with 
perjury and perhaps attempted murder because he once faced 
execution in the electric chair 
richardsons case also is being reviewed by gov bob martinez 
who was considering a request to recommend clemency to free the 
former orange picker from prison three cabinet members would have 
to concur 
this petition is going to crumble the house of cards the 
states case was built on miami lawyer ellis rubin said shortly 
before filing the petition 
rubin and lawyer mark lane of new york who wrote a book on the 
arcadia murders said richardson was framed partly to protect a 
friend of thensheriff frank cline the friend was related to betsy 
reese the richardsons baby sitter who rubin and lane say has 
confessed to the killings 
reese fed the children on the day of oct 25 1968 when james 
and annie mae richardson were working in the fields the children 
ranging in age from 2 to 8 died within a day after eating food 
laced with the deadly pesticide parathion 
the lawyers said richardson convicted on one count of 
firstdegree murder was an easy target because he was illiterate 
poor and black 
we know what racism was in florida in 1968 because of this 
case lets find out what it is in 19 and 88 this case is going to 
do it said rubin 
they based their petition on three claims 
the knowing use of perjury from the sheriff regarding an 
insurance policy richardson supposedly purchased for the seven 
children and from two former cellmates of richardsons who said he 
had confessed to the crime one has since recanted that statement 
prosecutors suppressed evidence that would have shown richardson 
had not yet purchased the insurance on the children 
newly discovered evidence former arcadia police chief richard 
barnard says he believes richardson was framed by the sheriff and 
affidavits from nursing assistants that betsy reese has told them 
she fed the poison to the children 
cline did not return a telephone message left at his home 
there was no answer thursday night at the office of state 
attorney frank schaub who won richardsons conviction in 1968 
schaub leaves office next month

the ruling communist party for the first 
time openly supported development of a multiparty system thursday 
and said independent political groups can take part in parliamentary 
elections in 1990 
janos berecz chief ideologist of the hungarian socialist 
workers communist party said in a report to the policysetting 
central committee that a law regulating parties should be passed 
before a new constitution is adopted in early 1990 
the party advocates societys right to selforganization 
and therefore it supports the enactment of a party law that will 
regulate the foundation of parties in keeping with the new 
constitution berecz said in his speech published by the official 
news agency mti 
it was the partys first direct support of a multiparty system 
in november the government approved for presentation to parliament 
draft bills to permit such a system 
berecz did not say what kind of power new parties will be 
permitted to wield mti has said the leading role of the hungarian 
socialist workers party will remain at least until the new 
constitution is adopted 
the keynote address by berecz comes a week before parliament is 
to pass a law on assembly and association that sparked a nationwide 
debate in hungary on the feasibility of a multiparty system 
however berecz rejected a multiparty system along a western 
democratic model 
we disagree with the bourgeois western interpretation of the 
multiparty system he said 
communists have also said they do not want to see the development 
of parties like those in czechoslovakia or east germany which carry 
little or no political weight they say parties that develop should 
be capable of bearing responsibility 
the countrys leaders have said the law would mean the acceptance 
in principle of a multiparty system but have emphasized that a 
separate law would be needed to regulate the establishment and 
function of independent political parties 
berecz said the draft constitution could be put before the 
central committee as early as may or june 1989 and then presented to 
parliament in the spring of 1990 following public debate on the 
draft 
he also advocated a plebiscite on the new constitution as 
demanded by independent groups and some lawmakers after it is 
approved by parliament 
elections could then be held in the second half of 1990 berecz 
was quoted as saying 
in an interview with the independent reform weekly published 
thursday central committee secretary matyas szueros indicated 
independent parties could begin to function on a local level as 
early as 1989 
dozens of independent organizations have mushroomed in the past 
year many with highly political platforms and nationwide support

abducted a shiite moslem guerrilla leader police said 
armed residents in the village of tibnin retaliated by kidnapping 
three irish soldiers with the un peacekeepers for about an hour a 
police spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
the irish soldiers were released after the mainstream shiite amal 
militia promised the villagers that the un interim force in 
lebanon will do its best to locate the guerrilla leader jawad 
kasfi and bring him back the spokesman said 
a source at the 5800strong unifil said villagers from tibnin

became new interior minister tanev a civilian has been a member 
of the policysetting central committee since 1981

offenses in bulgaria

regional party secretary for mihailovgrad in northwestern bulgaria 
among other changes in the 14member cabinet health minister

the piercing sounds blasted at a familys 
farm during a 13day police siege were demonstrated thursday at the 
trial of three polygamist clan members charged with a law officers 
death 
jurors showed little reaction as noises used in the psychological 
assault ranging from an airraid type siren to a sound resembling a 
stuck car horn were played from two 100watt speakers about 60 yards 
away from the summit county courthouse 
the demonstration came in the ninth day of the trial of clan 
patriarch addam swapp his brother jonathan swapp and brotherinlaw 
john timothy singer 
all are charged with seconddegree murder in the jan 28 death of 
corrections lt fred house 
house was shot and killed as he directed attack dogs toward the 
swapp brothers during an arrest attempt addam swapp who 
precipitated the standoff when he bombed a mormon chapel in nearby 
marion on jan 16 was seriously wounded during the same shootout 
judge michael murphy cautioned jurors that the demonstration was 
only to illustrate methods used to rob clan members of sleep in 
hopes of speeding their surrender and that they were not exact 
duplications 
defense attorneys have contended that loud piercing electronic 
noises lowflying aircraft flares and banks of brilliant lights 
used by authorities in an effort to exhaust the 15 barricaded clan 
members including nine children actually escalated tensions during 
the siege 
on wednesday elliott landau a psychologist called by the 
defense testified that the fbis use of the loudspeaker may have 
caused anxiety stress irritability and reduced reasoning ability 
among clan members during the standoff 
earlier testimony indicated the loudspeakers were used 
irregularly during the final days of the standoff and that they 
were repeatedly shot out or torn down by clan members 
addam swapp said the noises were a torture and they put pillows 
on the childrens heads in an attempt to block the sound he said he 
was compelled to shoot out or tear down the speakers to stop the 
crazy noise from hell 
also on wednesday addam swapp testified that neither he nor any 
other member of his family deliberately fired at officers during the 
firefight that ended the siege by 100 law officers 
he said once the siege began none of the family felt they could 
trust anything the authorities said 
swapp said he never fired at anyone during the siege and felt of 
killing its murder its wrong 
asked who should atone for the slaying he said that was an 
accident 
prosecutors contend and defense attorneys concede the 
wheelchairbound singer fired the fatal bullet but singer says he 
was aiming at the dogs not house 
in a related development carla foster a friend of the swapps 
was issued a misdemeanor citation charging her with illegally 
carrying a concealed weapon after she unwittingly brought a gun to 
the proceedings officers said 
foster 36 had handed her purse to a deputy stationed at a metal 
detector and told him the gun was inside she later explained to 
officers that she had left her purse in her car during the morning 
session and had retrieved it after lunch forgetting that the weapon 
was inside said detective sgt robert berry 
murphy barred foster from the courtroom for the remainder of the 
trial and she was ordered to appear tuesday in 3rd circuit court 
berry said the incident went virtually unnoticed in the courtroom

members were safe inside an enclosed boat called a survival pod 
the coast guard reported 
the rig rowan gorilla i capsized about 1200 miles east of new 
york city in galeforce winds of 40 to 60 knots and 40foot seas 
the coast guard said 
the tugboat smit london which had been towing the rig from nova 
scotia to yarmouth england remained with the pod said lt cmdr 
paul milligan a coast guard spokesman in new york 
two commercial vessels were heading toward the tug and pod they 
were about 200 miles away as of 4 pm and it was expected to take 
two days to get the crew out of the pod because of weather 
conditions he said a canadian p3 plane was on the scene he said 
the people are safe theres nothing that can be done until 
the seas subside milligan said 
the crew members entered the survival pod a boat that is 
completely enclosed and contains food and water about noon when it 
became apparent the rig might capsize he said 
nobody was injured when the rig capsized sometime in the early 
afternoon he said 
the rig owned by the rowan co inc of houston capsized but did 
not sink and will probably be salvaged milligan said 
the crew consists of 25 canadians and one american he said 
but maj glen urquhart a spokesman for search and rescue 
operations in halifax nova scotia said 27 people were in the pod 
including two women he said they were 25 canadians one american 
and one dutch crew member 
apparently theyre a little bit seasick but aside from that we 
havent had any other adverse reports he said 
tim brownlow a rowan crew member who had been scheduled to meet 
the rig in europe said the life pod has enough food and water for 
days and can stay afloat in the roughest weather 
have you ever put a cork in a bathtub thats what its like 
said brownlow who has worked on oil rigs for eight years theyre 
a selfrighting capsule they can flip flip flip and it will keep 
righting itself 
there will be some sick puppies tonight 
the rig began listing after one of its ballast tanks cracked and 
began taking in water said danny mcnease vice president of 
operations for the rowan co he said the rig about 300 feet wide 
and 300 feet long was built to withstand 100foot waves and 80 mph 
winds 
the rig which is not under lease to an oil company left halifax 
last week for the 30day trip across the atlantic to the north sea 
it can carry 86 men it is a jackup rig meaning its platform sits 
atop huge legs that are embedded in the sea floor during drilling

a fonmer deacon of a faithhealing sect was 
sentenced to 41 months in prison thursday for failing to seek 
medical help for his dying diabetic son 
bobby norman 43 who was convicted in october of firstdegree 
manslaughter in the death of his son aaron was a deacon in a 
nameless christian fellowship that followed a literal translation of 
the bible distrusted conventional medicine and practiced strict 
discipline of members 
aaron norman 10 died of complications related to juvenile 
diabetes at his parents mead home dec 20 1987 the day after he 
was spanked by his father and church founder doug kleber during a 
faithhealing session 
in 15 years as a judge nothing has bothered me more than this 
trial this sentencing spokane county superior court judge john 
schultheis said before handing down the sentence to a grimfaced 
norman 
in brief remarks prior to sentencing norman told schultheis he 
loved his son and asked for mercy so that he could remain with his 
shattered family especially an 8yearold son who is in counseling 
during an hourlong plea for leniency defense attorney roger 
peven argued that norman was under the influence of kleber and 
former spokane pastor jeffrey siegel 
drawing parallels to the followers of the rev jim jones who 
committed mass suicide in guyana peven argued that normally 
intelligent people can be seduced by evil people who subvert gods 
word to carry out their will 
schultheis told norman that as a parent i have to be the 
person that intervenes between the child and outside 
impediments you had the absolute obligation to intervene and you 
didnt do it 
deputy spokane county prosecutor clark colwell had asked 
schultheis to find exceptional circumstances that would allow him to 
sentence norman to more than the 3141 months called for by state 
sentencing guidelines 
kleber 34 of champaignurbana ill was sentenced dec 7 to 
three years in prison after pleading guilty to seconddegree 
criminal mistreatment he founded the sect dubbed the no name 
fellowship as a prayer group of christian athletes at the 
university of illinois in the 1970s where he played football 
siegel 33 of chapel hill nc also pleaded guilty to 
seconddegree criminal mistreatment and was sentenced to a twoyear 
term 
testimony during normans threeweek trial indicated the gravely 
ill boy was beaten the day before his death by his father and 
kleber while siegel and other church members watched the spankings 
were believed necessary to get the boy to confess to what they 
called the sin of masturbation which church elders believed was the 
cause of his illness 
norman a 24year burlington northern railroad employee 
testified that he believed klebers assurances that his son was 
recovering despite physical signs to the contrary 
norman and his wife judith originally were charged with 
homicide by abuse the charge against the norman was later reduced 
to firstdegree manslaughter and charges against mrs norman were 
dismissed 
charges of seconddegree criminal mistreatment also are pending 
against three other former sect leaders whose trials are scheduled 
for next year 
the fellowship which at its peak claimed about 300 adult members 
in four states disbanded in february

the reagan administration has reversed its 
historic policy toward yasser arafats palestine liberation 
organization by declaring it is ready for substantive dialogue 
with the group the united states has long denounced as a terrorist 
outcast on the world scene 
the announcement wednesday night left israel in diplomatic 
isolation and came just a few hours after presidentelect bush had 
taken a tough line against the plo declaring that it had not met 
us conditions for direct dealings 
but president reagan and secretary of state george p shultz said 
that arafat in statements made in geneva about the same time that 
bush was speaking had met the us conditions for a substantive 
dialogue a form of diplomatic acceptance long sought by the 
palestinian group 
shultz said arafats group had accepted un security council 
resolutions 242 and 338 recognized israels right to exist in peace 
and security and renounced terrorism 
opening meetings will be conducted in tunis where the plo has 
its headquarters by us ambassador robert h pelletreau jr

a congressional study places the largest 
government estimate yet on the price of bailing out the nations 
failing savings and loans and says the cost could soar even higher 
unless action is taken quickly 
the general accounting office says the government should spend 
112 billion to close failed institutions and abandon its current 
strategy of trying to keep the institutions alive through assisted 
mergers 
gao said the federal savings and loan insurance corp or fslic 
will need 85 billion over and above the 27 billion it expects to 
collect in fees from sampls through 1998 
however the congressional auditing and investigative agency 
warned that the pricetag will be even higher if interest rates rise 
most economists expect rates to climb through the middle of next 
year but offer no firm predictions beyond that

the time has come for those strangely ironic 
symptoms that seem inappropriate to the season but the rev lee 
fullerton offers some reassurance those holiday blues are 
really quite common 
as noted in pastoral and psychiatric counselling the melancholy 
oddly descends most widely in the presumably happiest periods 
especially the weeks from thanksgiving to christmas 
its when youre suppose to feel good and be happy said 
fullerton an atlanta pastor who has worked extensively in the 
mental health field but a lot of people dont feel that way 
theres a simple system for helping ward off that despondency he 
said talking about it with relatives friends or fellow church 
members or getting them to open up about it 
you cant just pull people out of it he said but it can 
help to encourage them to talk about it to let them know that most 
people have such feelings once in a while 
as a costless christmas present to others he suggested in a 
telephone interview pay a little more attention to people 
fullerton 39 pastor of atlantas steward avenue united 
methodist church and formerly a pastoral counselor at the georgia 
mental health institute has written some prechristmas advice on 
the subject for fellow clergy 
it was distributed by the urban mission arm of the denominations 
north georgia conference 
fullerton cited two main factors that bring on the slump in mood 
the holiday reality often doesnt match the popularized image and 
the pace of activities all around appear abnormally accelerated and 
burdensome 
everything seems speeded up the merchandising going into a 
frenzy people getting behind in their shopping and having to fight 
crowds and traffic to do anything he said it zaps their energy 
and their enjoyment too 
more basically for many the problem is shattered expectations 
he said 
theyve grown up thinking christmas should be a big family 
gathering with gifts and everybody around and food on the table 
but thats often not the way things are 
in many cases the contrast is acute for single people for 
oneparent families for the homeless and other poor that dont 
have enough money to get the one gift a child has wanted all year 
for these and others in similar circumstances the typically 
portrayed images of christmas simply dont live up to the reality 
and its as if something had died fullerton said 
it shows on them they feel guilty they blame themselves 
theyre a lot harder on themselves in judgment than god would ever 
be by such harsh judgments emotionally and physically were 
ruining our health 
in the pamphlet for clergy fullerton said the church has the 
unique opportunity to do two special things to proclaim the 
holiday season as a time for thanksgiving expectation and 
celebration and to minister to those who do not feel thankful 
expectant or celebrative 
he said seasonal depression also can bring related illnesses such 
as ulcers and headaches and also result in family disputes and 
violence when people feel helpless and hopeless the tendency to 
lash out is greater law enforcement and victims assistance 
officers receive more requests for services than at any other time 
of year 
although christmas blues are quite common he said many people 
suppress them because they feel guilty or ahsamed but a 
sensitive pastor can spot those seeming listless disinterested or 
restless and offer comfort 
he suggested pastors build sermons on cases of biblical 
characters who endured despair or inviting psychiatrists or 
hospital chaplains to address church groups on anxiety and 
depression 
help people to see the holiday blues as normal he advised 
encouraging them to share their troubles with others he said 
pastors are not immune to the problem in this busy season and tells 
them 
be aware of your own limitations 
fullerton said the holiday slump usually starts out as a kind of 
low grade depression and a little help can stop it from 
getting even deeper down the line 
a lot of deepseated problems start like this as a seasonal 
problem but those who stay in it get worse and worse and end up 
very depressed the results he added can be serious such as 
heavy drinking or suicidal impulses 
but why this inconsistent mixture of sadness creeping into a time 
of joy 
i see it as strangely consistent in the christian faith he 
said at christmas theres an element of being down in the pit 
and god comes to you there 
you couldnt accept it any other way and the situation seems 
you would never get out but god comes in

southern baptists now feel more free to 
speak out on social issues because they no longer bear the shame of 
racial segregation says the head of the denominations moral 
concerns agency 
the rev richard land executive director of the southern baptist 
christain life commission told seminary students that southern 
baptists had hesitated to deal with social problems because of fear 
of being criticized for segregation 
i think we at least had the decency at some level of 
consciousness to be ashamed of the segregation captivity of our 
churches for most of our history he said we were not able to 
apply our ethical position on social issues until we were liberated 
from that 
beyond that he said a different understanding of the separation 
of church and state has caused a sudden upsurge in the 
denominations political involvement 
i think the separation of church and state was used as an 
excuse for not getting involved as much as it was a conviction over 
whether we should be involved he said

individual and corporate credit users of late 
have been treating rising interest rates with a calm that hardly 
befits the situation 
the perception widely held is that the economy now is better 
able to handle its debt because many more loans than before carry 
adjustable interest rates flexibility is built in or so it is 
said 
a strong argument can be made however that the economy instead 
is much more creditsensitive than before the viewpoint involves 
among other things the type of credit the amount and length of it 
and the tax consequences 
the calm view of the credit future involves a view of adjustable 
rate loans which are far more common on big consumer items than in 
years gone by many see these loans as a positive factor in the 
credit outlook 
that is instead of being denied loans as frequently occurred in 
the days of fixedinterest rates borrowers will be granted credit 
this it is argued lessens the dangers of a credit crunch that 
would bring the economy down 
a more concerned view of the situation however sees adjustable 
loans as a threat to stability with interest rates rising people 
may find themselves unable to remain current on loan payments same 
effect the economy suffers 
but there are even more vital elements involved 
except for home mortgage loans interest on adjustablerate 
consumer loans will be taxed more heavily next year currently 40 
percent of interest escapes federal income taxes next year the 
deductible percentage drops to 20 
rising interest rates and falling deductibility therefore can 
produce a onetwo punch that could put some folks down for the count 
moreover many of these consumer loans are for periods 
considerably longer than just a decade ago and that too can create 
problems car loans are made for as long as five years now which 
often may be longer than the life of the car 
stress already is becoming serious in some automobile markets 
with the repossession rate rising markedly this year but 
repossession doesnt always resolve the problem some fiveyearold 
cars simply arent worth taking back 
the corporate market has its own problems business demand for 
shortterm credit has been fueled by the surge of leveraged buyout 
activity some of these loans probably are poor to begin with but 
an increase in interest rates and perhaps an economic downturn as 
well might quickly turn them into bad loans 
it might not take much of a downturn to show how unsound some of 
these lbo loans are because many were made on the basis of cash 
flow analyses that were optimistic even for a booming economy 
lbos also are soaking up liquidity threatening to limit funds 
available for more productive activities illiquidity could develop 
in 1989 because gross national product has been growing much faster 
than total bank reserves 
congress could radically change the game too although the chance 
of it being able to do so within the next year is questionable 
still it is possible that a congress trying to reduce budget 
deficits might seek revenue by taxing some of the lbo debt right 
now interest companies pay on lbo debt isnt taxed 
perhaps the nicest thing that can be said about the credit 
situation is that interest rates might not rise as so many 
forecasters expect and as fed policy would seem to indicate 
among others for example merrill lynch amp co expects that a 
slowing of economic growth in 1989 will allow interest rates to fall 
sharply but even if they do theres an awful lot of debt out there 
to be serviced

two days before christmas 20 years ago the 
captive crewmen of the spy ship uss pueblo crossed the bridge of 
no return to freedom but they still havent put their bitterness 
behind them 
i thought they would shoot me in the back recalled crew 
member harry iredale i didnt believe it until i was on the other 
side 
i felt like i had just come back from the dead said lloyd 
bucher captain of the ship that had been seized on the high seas by 
north korea the first such taking of a us warship in a century 
and a half 
the crewmembers remain angry at the american militarys failure 
to protect the lightly armed vessel or to come to its aid 
there were so many people at the joint chiefs of staff level on 
down who werent paying attention to their damn job said bucher 
they would have greatly preferred for the north koreans to have 
done us in completely 
instead one crewman was killed in the attack and the 82 others 
were subjected to 11 months of brutal captivity 
the us at that time had enormous military forces in the 
western pacific within 5 minutes flying time of us bucher now 
61 said in a telephone interview from his home in poway calif i 
would have thought something could be mustered to come to our aid 
but everybody just forgot we were there 
iredale 44 of fairfax was a civilian oceanographer employed by 
the navy and assigned to the pueblo to provide a cover for the 
ships real mission of collecting electronic intelligence he 
believes the capture demonstrated an american naivete about the 
world 
conducting espionage off the north korean coast was not the same 
as running similar missions off the soviet union he said the 
north koreans didnt play by the rules 
throughout the attack seizure and early days of captivity 
iredale said we expected someone to come over the horizon to 
rescue us 
robert j chicca a marine sergeant who worked as a korean 
linguist on the pueblo said he still finds it difficult to believe 
there was no retaliation 
i would lay the blame on every military commander who was in 
helping range and didnt come said chicca 44 in a telephone 
interview from his home in bonita calif 
retired adm john j hyland commander in chief of the pacific 
fleet at the time said it is difficult to provide protection for a 
spy ship 
writing in this falls issue of naval history magazine hyland 
said there isnt any way you can do anything for an 
intellgiencegathering ship unless you want to accompany it with a 
destroyer which would defeat the purpose 
bucher who retired from the navy in 1973 after 27 years of 
service said the lack of preparedness that permitted the pueblo 
humiliation persists in the military today 
pointing to the failed mission to rescue american hostages in 
iran in 1980 and the terrorist bombing that killed more than 200 
marines in beirut in 1983 he said as the years have passed i 
have learned of the incredible disarray our defenses are in 
the weather was clear and cold on jan 23 1968 as the pueblo 
lolled about 15 miles off the north korean coast three miles 
outside the communist nations territorial waters 
iredale was taking watertemperature measurements as four north 
korean torpedo boats and two subchasers all heavily armed 
approached the 176foot pueblo around noon 
they circled around and had their guns trained on us iredale 
said 
a subchaser raised a signal flag asking the pueblos nationality 
and bucher ordered the hoisting of the american flag when the 
subchaser ordered the pueblo to follow it the american ship began 
to move away 
one of the boats suddenly opened fire on the pueblo with its 57mm 
cannon slightly wounding bucher and another crewman a later salvo 
killed fireman duane hodges and wounded chicca and several others 
bucher ordered the pueblo stopped and stalled for time as crewmen 
radioed for help and frantically destroyed classified documents 
shortly after 2 pm the pueblo which never fired a shot from 
its 50caliber machine guns was boarded by about 10 north korean 
soldiers clad in olive green quilted jackets and carrying submachine 
guns 
the pueblo became the first american warship captured since 1807 
when a british ship forced the uss chesapeake to surrender off the 
virginia capes 
after the north koreans failed to extract confessions from 
the men during initial interrogations the torture and beatings 
began 
they wanted us to say we were inside their territorial waters 
and spying on them iredale said 
you were helpless and after a while hopeless 
the worst part of the imprisonment was hell week which came 
late in the crews captivity iredale said 
they had me kneel down and took a hammer handle and started 
pounding my head they put a board on the back of my knees and 
jumped up and down on it 
after it stopped they came in and gave me a pail of water and a 
brush to wash my blood off the floor and stucco walls iredale 
said 
bucher said he was kicked into unconsciousness that i endured 
a few times 
chiccas nose was broken several times they didnt like 
marines he said 
freedom finally came on dec 23 at the bridge separating north 
korea and south korea but only after american officials signed an 
apology that they immediately repudiated 
a navy court of inquiry recommended a courtmartial for bucher 
who violated the hallowed navy code of dont give up the ship 
that finding was reduced to a letter of reprimand by the commander 
of the pacific fleet 
the court of inquiry also recommended a reprimand for the admiral 
responsible for ensuring the pueblos safety 
secretary of the navy john b chafee overturned the panels 
recommendations on the day they were made public saying the pueblo 
crew had suffered enough 
if he bucher hadnt surrendered they would have blown the 
ship out of the water iredale said it would be suicide 
bucher said he was under orders to observe the north koreans but 
not to incite them 
still he said in some ways he feels personally responsible 
whatever i was unable to do are the things i feel worst about 
he said 
if i had a way to destroy the ship we would have abandoned it 
and blown it up i tried to get cans of tnt before we sailed but 
the navy said they didnt have any

for years playing the blues was a sure way to 
get them says guitar great bb king 
that has hit me pretty hard that the blues were not popular 
for a long time said king recalling the days in the 1960s and 
70s when he was more popular in europe than at home it was like 
being black twice but i kept working hard kept practicing kept 
playing 
he and lucille his guitar are still playing after 
overcoming prejudice both racial and musical king is now revered as 
a blues giant hes just released his 52nd blues album and he 
almost steals the show from u2 in their concert movie u2 rattle 
and hum 
i was in ireland and u2 lead singer bono came by king 
said recently about their collaboration id always admired him 
and the group and we talked about songwriting i told him to think 
of me when he was writing and he said ok ill do it 
the result when love comes to town features king swapping 
vocals with bono and playing his distinctive lead guitar over u2s 
backbeat a merging of the mississippi delta and the emerald isle 
recorded at the renowned sun studios in memphis tenn 
king 63 was born in indianola miss and took up the guitar at 
an early age he started out playing and singing gospel but soon 
began taking requests from churchgoers for more secular music 
making the guitar a career he recalled was a financial decision 
easily reached 
i made 2250 on a plantation driving a tractor all week 
playing guitar on a saturday night i made 25 understand thats 
for one evening king said thats when i decided 
king moved to memphis after world war ii dubbing himself the 
beale street blues boy later shortened to bb in 1951 he 
scored his first hit with 3 oclock blues and his career was off 
and running 
but during the british invasion of the 60s and the disco craze 
of the 70s king and his music slipped into the background despite 
the lack of acclaim king never considered playing any other music 
no i didnt even think about it i never felt that way he 
said i felt bad i felt ridiculed looked down upon for doing 
this kind of music i wished it was different but everything i play 
is bluesy 
king said his instantlyrecognizable guitar style was developed 
more because of his ears than his hands i cant hear lows so i 
would turn the treble up thats how it started 
but its evolving to this day he said before a manhattan 
appearance at the benson and hedges blues festival to benefit the 
homeless 
its always changing im influenced by everything there are 
young people today who come up and say they idolize me i learn 
from them its a roundrobin 
another thing that has the veteran musician smiling is the number 
of current artists who are acknowledging the blues are the mother 
of all music king cited robert cray as a particular favorite 
then he named another musician who loved the blues the late john 
lennon 
i remember once an interviewer asked john lennon what hed like 
to being doing and he said playing guitar playing the blues like 
bb king king said he never knew what that meant to me it 
feels good to hear people talk like that 
despite his advancing years king keeps an active schedule he 
estimates spending 300 days a year on the road and he has no 
intention of hanging up lucille any time in the near future 
when the great creator says its enough thats when ill 
stop said king what else would i do its like count basie 
told me one time my friends are around the world if i stopped 
playing how could i see them all

another holiday season brings a riot of photography 
books on subjects ranging from the honey hunters in nepal to water 
towers taken by photographers from ansel adams to fstop fitzgerald 
all of the people who have been storing those back issues of 
national geographic can throw them out if they can come up with 65 
for odyssey the art of photography at national geographic 
thomassongrant the selections from 100 years of national 
geographic photography are rich in quality and variety 
among other retrospectives john loengard has assembled life 
classic photography a personal interpretation new york graphic 
society 2495 each photograph is accompanied by a succinct 
provocative statement on how the shot came to be giving it a 
textbook value 
the west is at the top of landscape books with two works from the 
graphic society ansel adams letter and images 50 and eliot 
porters the west 60 the adams book is distinguished by the 
late photographers lucid personal reflections on his art while 
porters shots stand alone with the luster of oil paintings 
to complete the history lesson the life and work of a western 
photography pioneer can be found in william henry jackson and the 
transformation of the american landscape by peter b hales 
temple university press 3995 
the hit of the midwest is hometowns an american pilgrimage 
graphic society 50 george tice looks for a connection between 
three little midwestern towns and three large figures they produced 
james deans fairmount ind ronald reagans dixon ill and mark 
twains hannibal mo 
wayfarer a voice from the southern mountains oxmoor house 
50 is photographer william a bakes fourth book on the south 
the poet james dickey spins an interesting but uneven tale to 
accompany the photographs 
one of the best features on new england comes from life magazine 
legend alfred eisenstaedt who in eisenstaedt marthas vineyard 
oxmoor house 35 lets us in on his personal collection of 50 
years of photographing his summer place 
from more exotic places come rare glimpses at the honey hunters 
of nepal by eric valli abrams 2995 and the whisper of 
stars a siberian journey the globe pequot press 2495 the 
first offers breathtaking shots of the gurung tribe committing the 
cliffhanging robberies that have helped sustain the himalayan 
people for centuries in the second boston globe twotime pulitzer 
prizewinner stan grossfeld captures the warmth and life of an 
almost mythically forbidding land 
there also are portraits aplenty this year from the popular 
study of the ruling house of windsor in cecil beaton the royal 
portraits simon and schuster 35 to sally manns evocative 
look at girls on the brink of maturity at twelve portraits of 
young women new images 25 
at the head of the class is album the portraits of duane 
michals 19581988 twelvetrees press 55 michals says he is 
only sharing an encounter he had with movie stars and ordinary 
people that most were strangers to him and therefore his portraits 
revealed nothing profound about the subjects or captured 
anything but there is an almost palpable selfconsciousness on 
the part of the subjects and the photographer that gives these 
portraits a special freshness 
nicholas nixon pictures of people graphic society 40 
coincides with the museum of modern arts first retrospective on the 
41yearold photographer his use of a largeformat camera not in 
vogue since walker evans depressionera work forces some sobering 
confrontations with subjects such as the elderly and aids victims 
like beaton patrick lichfields royal portraits helped make him 
one of the few british photographers to work for vogue his 
portraits and pictures from a style that emerged from commercial 
work are presented in lichfield in retrospect salem house 35 
jazz lovers will be thrilled with jazz a visual 
retrospective billboard publications 60 designer k abe has 
combed archives for portraits so often revealing because the 
subjects as critic nat hentoff says in introducing the 350 
photographs are less likely than most people to wear masks 
an insiders look at 50 years of jazz can be found in bass 
line the stories and photographs of milt hinton by hinton and 
david g berger temple university press 3995 the great bass 
player also has a remarkable eye 
for cultural significance there may be no more important a book 
than peter weiermairs the hidden image the mit press 45 a 
look at the evolution of the male nude in photography but like 
robert mapplethorpe graphic society 50 whose beautiful work 
has long been augmented with sometimes shocking male nudes the book 
will not be of general appeal 
if one of photographys aims is to draw attention to details we 
might otherwise give little notice there is no more successful book 
than mit press 50 water towers by bernd and hilla becher the 
effect can only be realized by leafing through the bechers 
groupings of these often overlooked staples of the industrial 
landscape 
among other books of interest author stephen king and 
photographer fstop fitzgerald his legal name take a look at 
gargoyles in nightmares in the sky viking studio books 
2995 ansel adams and writer john herseys talents help make 
potent manzanar times books 2750 a look at one of the 
japanese internment camps of world war ii carl chiarenzas

few people remember the days before 
irrigation dams killed the salmon runs on the umatilla river 
but the umatilla indians never forgot and more than 70 years 
after the rivers waters became the property of white farmers the 
indians are seeing salmon returning as a result of a huge federal 
commitment to restore a part of the circle of life 
its like a part of us returns part of my body said louie 
dick jr vice chairman of the board of trustees for the umatilla 
tribe because that is part of my body the salmon 
about 600 members of the tribe still live on a reservation just 
east of pendleton about 40 miles up the umatilla river from where 
it empties into the columbia river at this town 
the treaty that put them on the reservation in 1855 was supposed 
to guarantee the right to gather traditional foods in their usual 
places including the salmon swimming up the umatilla river 
but after 1914 when a series of five irrigation dams was built 
so much water was diverted for farms there wasnt enough left in the 
riverbed for the coho and chinook salmon to swim through the broad 
shallow stretches and over 24foottall threemile dam to spawn in 
the headwaters and tributaries 
only the steelhead a type of rainbow trout related to salmon 
survived the dams because they could wait for the winter rains to 
raise the river and were better at climbing the crude fish ladders 
for the umatilla tribe the loss of the salmon left a gap in the 
circle of eight inseparable elements that make up life speech 
food religion shelter clothing water the land and the person 
when we talk of food we talk of food that creator he lent 
this to ussaid dick 
what you would call the amber waves of grain are not really 
that important to an indian background i know the farmer says 
irrigation is bread and gives food to the person to the indian 
person no 
in 1980 congress created the northwest power planning council 
with a mandate to restore fish runs wiped out by dams in the 
columbia river system thats when the umatilla treaty began to have 
power 
working with the council the bonneville power administration a 
branch of the us department of energy that markets power from 28 
dams has spent 8 million on the umatilla and is committed to a 
total of 25 million said jay marcotte manager of the umatilla 
basin project for bpa 
congress ordered bpa because it sells electricity from dams that 
devastated fish runs to set aside a portion of its profits 
protect mitigate and enhance fish and wildlife 
the us forest service and the umatilla indians use that money 
on their respective lands and the oregon department of fish and 
wildlife uses it on private land to stop erosion that smothers 
spawning beds to deepen shallow channels and to build new fish 
ladders traps and outtake screens on the dams a new hatchery is 
planned near the mouth of the river 
between 1981 and 1987 bpas expenditures to improve columbia 
basin fish runs included 120 million in direct payments and it 
calculated four times that much in indirect payments such as lost 
revenue from storing water to help fish get over the dams rather 
than using it to turn turbines 
gary james who manages the fisheries program for the umatilla 
indians is seeing the effects 
this was the very first year weve gotten adult coho back to 
the river he said weve got a total of about 1500 coho back 
so far the fall chinook we are getting is the best run weve had 
too the total run of adults and jacks is approaching 1500 as 
well 
in the next 15 years james hopes to see 40000 salmon and 
steelhead returning annually with 15000 reaching the headwaters to 
spawn 
november marked the first time in more than 70 years that the 
umatilla indians have been able to take salmon from the river 
carrying their name 
the fishing place and the memories of salmon in this river are so 
distant from the reservation that few took advantage but more are 
expected as the runs improve 
dan mills a farmer on the board of the stanfield irrigation 
district stood in hip boots and wielded a net as he helped state 
biologists gather fish in a trap at threemile dam to analyze the 
success of various smolt releases 
agriculture has kind of been in direct competition with whats 
going on here mills said as long as we can work together on 
it it will be an excellent deal theres also no way of stopping it 
for every one of us with irrigation rights theres 50 guys who 
want to go fishing 
the biggest improvement of all will be a 42 million us bureau 
of reclamation project to supply local farmers with water from the 
columbia river that will leave for the fish the water that farmers 
used to take from the umatilla the program has been approved by 
congress but has yet to be financed 
the government created the problem by subsidizing all the 
irrigation system dams built early in the century said james 
before that the water was to be kept in the river so the salmon 
could reach the reservation 
i like the way the irrigators attorney put it the government 
sold the car twice and now both parties want to drive it 
this was one of the few situations where the tribe and the 
irrigators thought it was a winwin situation

a maverick researchers efforts to speed 
tests on unproven cancer therapies by selling them to any patients 
willing to pay is faltering 
dr robert k oldham founder of biotherapeutics inc has so far 
been unable to show that the treatments which cost as much as 
24000 can prolong lives or reduce the severity of symptoms 
although patients stoutly defend their right to seek his 
experimental help oldham is failing to attract enough patients to 
make a profit what is more he has been attacked by doctors and 
scientists who say its unethical and possibly dangerous to sell 
treatments not yet shown to work 
dr arnold relman editor of the new england journal of medicine 
says patients who go to oldham are people desperate with fear 
theyre dying of cancer and theyre encouraged to believe there 
might be some hope its cruel deception its commercial 
exploitation of a tragedy i think its totally immoral 
biotherapeutics was the first profitmaking enterprise to take 
advantage of government reluctance to allow sales of most 
experimental drugs until theyve been throroughly tested for safety 
and effectiveness 
oldhams daring decision to sell such unproven treatments to the 
public and risk federal closure has put biotherapeutics in the 
midst of a debate over what the government might do to speed 
delivery of new drugs to dying patients 
the outcome is vitally important to anyone who will be touched by 
cancer aids heart disease or any other incurable ailment 
oldham is selling what are called immune therapies they have 
been widely touted as an important fourth weapon against cancer 
augmenting the triple arsenal of chemotherapy radiation and surgery 
that cure only about half of the almost 1 million americans 
diagnosed with cancer each year 
immune therapies sometimes called biological therapies are 
intended to provoke the bodys immune system to destroy invading 
cancer cells 
the hope and so far it remains little more than a hope is 
that the therapies may attack tumors impervious to conventional 
therapies 
another potential advantage is that the immune system may target 
cancer cells more accurately than conventional treatments thus 
producing fewer of the harmful side effects often associated with 
chemotherapy and radiation 
dr steven a rosenberg of the national cancer institute who has 
done much of the pioneering work in biological therapy calls this 
the dawn of a new approach to treating cancer 
ive now had almost 20 patients with widespread metastatic 
cancer thats disappeared rosenberg said in an interview 
rosenberg is however a sharp critic of oldham he asserts that 
biological therapy is not ready for widespread use the worst 
thing we can do is raise false expectations he said 
biotherapeutics inc is located in a squat modern redbrick 
building just outside franklin an antebellum town 18 miles south of 
nashville with a picturesque square frequently sought out by 
moviemakers 
the buildings yshaped entrance resembles an antibody molecule 
a reminder of the companys use of cancer antibodies in some 
treatments 
oldham the companys dominant presence is a wellknown 
researcher with more than 300 papers to his credit among his 
accomplishments he lists the discovery of certain white blood cells 
called natural killer cells which help defend the body against 
disease 
he began his research career at the national cancer institute he 
left in 1975 to establish the cancer program at vanderbilt 
university but returned to the cancer institute in 1980 to initiate 
research on biological therapy for cancer 
he left the institute again in 1984 this time to set up 
biotherapeutics which focuses almost exclusively on the use of 
biological anticancer agents 
oldham is a tough combative man he bristles at criticism of 
biotherapeutics and seeks opportunities to defend himself and his 
enterprise 
if cancer patients want the treatments he offers whether those 
treatments work or not then the patients ought to get them oldham 
says where does society come off saying you cant have it he 
argued 
for more than three years oldham has sidestepped federal 
regulations on the sale of experimental treatments by claiming to be 
in the business of patientfunded research 
oldham says he is not selling treatment he says hes recruiting 
patients to serve as subjects in cancer research and to pay for 
the privilege 
he says what he is doing is no different from what the national 
cancer institute is doing except for the source of the funding the 
cancer institute gets its money from congress biotherapeutics gets 
its money from patients 
but is oldham selling research interviews with patients oldham 
and other company officials suggest that people are coming to 
biotherapeutics not to contribute to a research effort but to try 
to save their lives 
here is the wording on a poster outside his office if you had 
cancer and traditional treatments werent effective what would you 
do give up or fight pursuing every option when standard 
therapies fail we offer patients a scientifically valid option 
ask oldhams patients why they have come to him and its clear 
theyre seeking treatment not a chance to be guinea pigs 
james e murphy was recently treated by oldham for colon cancer 
his doctor in washington dc had told him he could do nothing 
more for him why had murphy come to oldham 
you dont have any alternative if you want to fight it he 
said in an interview in his hospital room eventually i will die 
but at least ill give it a shot i think biotherapeutics 
charging for experimental treatments is better than not giving 
people a shot at it 
murphy 60 said he hoped his case would help oldham learn 
something that might help others but that wasnt why he was there 
a salesman for a computer systems development company murphy 
said he and his wife paid for his treatment with money from their 
retirement account 
murphy knows the biotherapeutics treatment is a long shot oldham 
explained that well and he believes that ideally experimental 
treatments shouldnt be commercialized as oldhams are 
but the government isnt doing anything murphy said you 
call the national institutes of health and ask about colon cancer 
and you get a tape you call oldham and if you are have the 
strength left and the money you get treated

the two principal therapies oldham is using are monoclonal 
antibodies and adoptive immunotherapy 
monoclonal antibodies are protective proteins produced in mice 
that have been injected with human cancer cells such antibodies 
could theoretically attack and destroy tumors or could be used to 
carry cancerkilling drugs directly to tumors 
oldham is selling a monoclonal antibody treatment for 24000 
does it work its too soon to tell he said 
adoptive immunotherapy involves taking immune cells from cancer 
patients stimulating the cells with a drug called interleukin2 
and reinjecting them in the hope the cells will attack the 
patients tumors the cells are called lymphokineactivated killer 
cells or laks 
this treatment has been shown to be of some help in fighting 
melanoma and kidney cancer ten percent of such patients show a 
dramatic reduction in tumor size but whether the treatments will 
improve or extend their lives is not yet known 
its probably helping some people said dr bruce chabner 
director of the cancer treatment program at the national cancer 
institute kidney and other urinary cancers will strike 22500 
americans this year and melanoma will strike 27300 says the 
american cancer society 
oldham is selling adoptive immunotherapy for 50 percent off the 
regular price of 19400 does it work its too early to tell 
he said 
many of oldhams critics have questioned why the fda hasnt acted 
to stop biotherapeutics charging for experimental treatments is 
usually prohibited by the fda according to dr robert temple a 
director in the fdas drug evaluation office 
we in general dont think people should be charged for 
investigational drugs he said they havent been shown to work 
yet its not fair 
the fda says it hasnt made a decision yet on biotherapeutics 
many doctors outside the fda say the agency is knotted in sharp 
internal debate 
peter barton hutt formerly the fdas chief counsel and now a 
washington lawyer put the fdas fundamental dilemma this way if 
someone is desperately ill and has no other hope should the 
government tell them what they can take balanced against that if 
the patient is desperately ill and has no hope should there be 
protection against them being defrauded 
an additional complication is that biotherapeutics company 
structure makes it difficult for the fda to act 
biotherapeutics does not send its drugs across state lines it 
has hospital affiliates scattered across the country but each 
hospital has a nearby laboratory that produces drugs according to 
the biotherapeutics recipe 
dr bruce burlington director of the fdas division of 
biological investigational new drugs said that limits the agencys 
ability to act with intrastate activities there is debate over 
the extent of our jurisdiction he said 
while the fda ponders its moves the ethical debate over oldhams 
activities continues 
dr michael grodin a pediatrician and director of the medical 
ethics program at boston university says oldham clearly has 
conflicting interests 
as a doctor he should be helping patients as a researcher he 
should be trying to advance general knowledge not to save dying 
patients and as a businessman he should be trying to keep his 
company afloat 
it seems to me that the patient cant sort that out even if 
the researcher can said grodin 
the immediate concern of biotherapeutics is not however in 
resolving these ethical tangles but in curing the companys 
financial ills 
in the most recent fiscal year biotherapeutics lost almost 10 
million of the 40 million stake it raised to go into business it 
treated 400 patients and said louis p berneman the companys 
president the expectations were that that would have been 
higher he wouldnt say exactly what the company had hoped for 
if management cant turn its troubled finances around the 
company wont survive beyond 1990 said joseph clark its chief 
financial officer clark added however that he had little doubt 
that the company would make it 
it has already taken some drastic steps the price of its most 
expensive product the monoclonal antibody treatment has been cut 
from 35000 to 24000 adoptive immunotherapy is on sale for 
9700 
the company hopes to persuade patients insurance companies to 
come up with the rest although insurance companies as a rule do not 
reimburse patients for experimental treatments 
biotherapeutics hopes the fda will approve interleukin2 next 
year for use against kidney cancer and melanoma berneman thinks 
insurance companies will then reimburse the costs of adoptive 
immunotherapy 
oldham is determined to press on against whatever odds some of 
our critics would legislate and regulate against us being 
available he said and that is wrong

as his revolution approaches its 30th 
birthday president fidel castro has become something of an 
ideological renegade in the communist world waging a lonely 
struggle in defense of socialist purity while others experiment with 
capitalist reforms 
his recent speeches underscore his resistance to change he has 
adhered to a strict constructionist viewpoint with only minor 
variations since that new years day three decades ago when he 
toppled a discredited dictator and proceeded to turn cuba upside 
down 
while the soviet union and other communist countries try to 
overcome economic stagnation by borrowing some capitalist practices 
castro remains a noapologies defender of centralized planning and 
state domination of the economy 
some analysts even foresee the possibility of the first serious 
sovietcuban rift since the two countries became devoted allies in 
1968 
the soviets are clearly displeased with what they regard as cuban 
misuse of economic aid which has averaged about 5 billion annually 
in recent years 
in a recent article the soviet newspaper pravda blamed cuba for 
serious imperfections at sovietbacked industrial projects in 
cuba 
castro meanwhile makes no attempt to conceal his disdain for 
soviet reforms cuba he has said must watch over the ideological 
purity of the revolution that is why we cannot use any methods 
that reek of capitalism 
he acknowledged recently that his countrys future is somewhat 
more uncertain as a result of the kremlins philosophical shift 
we can expect difficulties that may come from the enemy camp 
the united states and difficulties that may come from the camp of 
our own friends he said 
in 1986 at about the time soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
began moving toward capitaliststyle reforms castro shut down a 
sixyear experiment involving the sale by farmers of their produce 
at market rates he was afraid that a spreading capitalist mentality 
and a highincome elite might take hold 
most experts say cuba is too valuable an ally for moscow to cut 
adrift simply because of differing economic policies cuba provides 
important political support for moscow and is widely admired 
throughout much of africa and latin america 
cuba also serves as an indispensable base for soviet monitoring 
of us military and space activities at one facility alone 2100 
soviet technicians engage in intercepts of us communications 
according to american officials 
castro had planned a huge welcome here for gorbachev on dec 9 
but the visit was postponed on short notice because of the 
earthquake in soviet armenia 
despite the apparent durability of sovietcuban relations 
castros unorthodox views have left him somewhat out of the marxist 
mainstream 
while other countries look on material incentives for workers as 
a fact of life that must be accepted as the price for increased 
production castro believes perhaps more firmly than before that 
people should work not for personal gain but out of a sense of 
patriotic duty 
to the extent that cuba is undergoing difficult economic times 
castro says the fault lies not with the system but with human 
frailty the lack of revolutionary zeal whatever the reason the 
cuban economy has been stagnant for more than two years 
castro of course never has been one to follow the crowd he has 
spent a lifetime overcoming long odds 
in a recent speech he recalled the time in december 1956 when 
at the start of his guerrilla struggle serious setbacks reduced his 
forces to no more than a few devoted followers defeat seemed 
imminent 
now we are millions he said using the analogy to underscore 
his view that seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome 
through patience and political will 
but as castro himself has admitted no challenge for him has been 
more difficult than bringing about economic wellbeing for his 
countrymen 
food and clothing are strictly rationed and there is an acute 
shortage of adequate housing for transportation cubans must rely 
on buses that too often are overcrowded or make their rounds too 
infrequently cubans also complain about bureaucratic lethargy and 
poor service generally in restaurants and elsewhere 
the quality of life for the average cuban compared with 
developed countries is dreary although there appear to be few 
destitute cubans many workers finds their jobs unfulfilling youths 
complain about a lack of recreational opportunities 
as an alternative to the drab governmentcontrolled press cubans 
these days snatch up spanishlanguage soviet magazines which have a 
quality cuban publications lack openness 
ofelia espinosa who works at a local newsstand said some soviet 
weeklies are sold out in five minutes two years ago we used to 
throw them out she said 
there is no overt persecution of cubans who practice their 
religion but such people have little hope of rising to positions of 
authority christmas was officially abolished years ago because the 
celebration interfered with the sugar harvest but there are signs of 
a more flexible government attitude nowadays toward that occasion 
some families say they are discreetly doing this year what was 
unthinkable in previous years putting up a christmas tree 
while there is more tolerance for outspokenness than before 
cubans who make known their disdain for the system do so at their 
own risk worker absenteeism has been a problem for all 30 castro 
years a phenomenon that is not surprising in a country that claims 
to guarantee a job for everybody 
theft at state enterprises has been a major headache for the 
regime on a secret tape that was smuggled out of cuba defense 
minister raul castro said 1 million police couldnt solve the 
problem without stricter accounting controls 
in many professions requirements of the state leave little room 
for creativity a cuban judge knows the judiciary is subservient to 
the state a journalist is aware that he must report within the 
narrow boundaries imposed by party dogma 
cuba also is viewed by the reagan administration as a threat to 
us interests because of its generous support for nicaraguas 
leftist government and aid to guerrilla groups elsewhere 
a related issue is the militarization of cuban society cuba 
spends a higher percentage of its national budget on the military 
than all but a few countries worldwide 
according to us figures cuba has 950 battle tanks compared 
with canadas 114 its military establishment is comparable to that 
of brazil a country with a population 13 times the size of cubas 
among nations that have embraced communism cuba appears to be 
one of the more successful several of the more recent converts to 
marxism are wracked by civil war and poverty in cuba there is less 
absolute poverty than in any country in latin america where 
unemployment and underemployment rates run as high as 50 percent

for millions of cubans castro remains an inspirational figure 
his oratorical skills are undiminished he impresses visitors with 
the breadth of his interests ranging from medicine to nuclear 
power little occurs in cuba which escapes his restless gaze seldom 
has a leader of so small a country had an international impact as 
great as his 
he can claim partial credit for the agreement under which south 
africa will grant namibia africas last colony independence and 
black majority rule that was castros price for agreeing to 
withdraw cubas forces from angola 
above all he sees himself as the broker for the dispossessed he 
constantly expresses outrage about the injustice of a world in which 
some countries enjoy boundless abundance while others starve 
120000 children every three days a hiroshima and a nagasaki every 
72 hours he claims 
castro is proud that the infant mortality rate in cuba is 
comparable to that in some of the most developed countries one 
reason cuba has had difficulty developing economically is that so 
much of the countrys resources go toward meeting basic human needs 
housing schools and hospitals 
the vast majority of cubas children have the opportunity to 
develop their minds and bodies through cubas farreaching 
educational and sports programs 
on a per capita basis cuba quite possibly produces more good 
boxers runners swimmers and baseball players than any other 
country 
while more than a million cubans have fled the island since 1959 
the revolution has rescued countless others mostly peasants and 
workers from the social and economic oblivion they endured under 
the previous system 
blockbyblock defense committees are used to monitor the 
politically suspect but they also have helped make cubas streets as 
safe as any in the hemisphere castro also boasts that cuba is drug 
free 
castro has been at the helm in cuba for well over half his adult 
life and at 62 he shows no sign of slowing down if he does 
falter brother raul 57 has been tapped as the successor 
but fidel as he is known to his countrymen may well be around 
for years to come he has outlasted six american presidents next 
month ronald reagan will become the seventh

about the time chrysler was getting ready to introduce its 
minivans for the 1984 model year mazda employees in california had 
their own concept for a minivan on the drawing boards 
the result the 1989 mazda mpv debuted in november and marks a 
milestone in the japanese automakers history the mpv an 
aerodynamicshaped and smartly dressed package is the first mazda 
vehicle born of an initial design that originated in the united 
states in fact the mpv for multipurpose vehicle is not sold 
today in japan mazdas home country 
the vehicle designed with american buyers in mind is built in 
japan but sold only in the united states and canada sales of about 
40000 are forecast through october 1989 including about 4000 
fourwheeldrive models due out beginning in march said spokesman 
fred aikins for the following 12 months steady sales of another 
40000 are expected he added 
early results were heartening with mazda reporting more than 900 
sold in the first three weeks the vehicles were out 
we feel the minivan market is continuing to expand aikins 
said our sales need to come from the additional buyers into the 
market and from the domestics 
besides chrysler ford and general motors also sell small vans 
though chrysler outpaces all the competition in sales the no 3 
us automaker has sold more than 1 million of its dodge caravan and 
plymouth voyager vans since the 1984 model year 
major japanese automakers such as toyota and nissan also sell 
minivans here but aikins said the mazda mpv is different because it 
is not as boxlike as the competitors in price however the mpv is 
in the midst of all the others 
aikins said the base price for a twopassenger cargo van is 
10989 with the lowestpriced fivepassenger mpv wagon at 12909 
the base price for a sevenpassenger mpv with the standard 
fourcylinder engine is 13759 
the test vehicle had a v6 engine and topped out at just over 
19000 those price ranges are comparable to the competition 
the mpv has a side door that opens outward like a regular car 
door rather than a sliding side door that is standard on other 
vans the mpvs side door however opens to a maximum 90 degrees 
greater than that on a car door 
the design allows a slightly wider door opening on the vehicle 
than on other small vans aikins noted the swingout door is 
lighter and easier for children to manage than some sliding doors 
the mpv side door also features a bar thats easy to grab and use 
when manuevering around in the back 
in addition swingout doors have greater durability and are less 
prone to rattles during driving aikins said 
another feature on the test mpv a sevenpassenger model was a 
threepassenger rear bench seat with a seatback that folded down so 
the folded seat could be pushed upward and locked in place behind 
the middle bench seat its an unusuallooking arrangement but 
provides cargo space in back 
on other vans the rear seat can be unlocked from the floor and 
removed but the mpv rear seat cant be removed unless hand tools 
are used first to unfasten it from the floor thats a bit awkward 
and timeconsuming for someone who wants to get large long items in 
the van 
but aikins countered that buyers may not have to remove the mpv 
rear seat seat at all mazda designed the rear seat bench and the 
twopassenger middle seat with seatbacks that fold down backwards 
for a somewhat uneven but mostly flat bed aikins suggested buyers 
just load their long items on that bed 
but i dont know that owners want long dirty items such as 
wood on their upholstery wouldnt owners rather put the items on 
the floor as permitted in other vans the mpvs middle seat is 
removable however with a flip of a couple latches if you have 
cargo that is not very long 
the mpv like all vans offered good visibility because of its 
higher riding profile still it handled like a car except for some 
body sway around corners 
the van is reardrive as opposed to the frontdrive chrysler 
products permitting towing capabilities of up to 4300 pounds with 
the optional mpv towing package despite the reardrive 
configuration however the mpv has a flat floor save for the 
slightly raised area under the rear bench seat where suspension coil 
springs are located 
probably the most enjoyable part of the mpv was the optional 
3liter v6 engine which performed flawlessly teamed with a 
fourspeed automatic overdrive transmission the engine was smooth 
and peppy its the same powerplant thats in the mazda 929 
the standard engine for the mpv is a 26liter fourcylinder 
thats newly developed for the van aikins said 
another highlight of the mpv was the nicely appointed interior 
upholstery is placed on the sides of the doors providing soft 
armrests and carpeting is below on the sides of the doors giving 
the impression of a nicely integrated interior there was even a 
nifty pulldown twocup holder on the side of the front passenger 
seat 
about the only complaint was that the dashboard featured a tiny 
mapbox and a toosmall glovebox the vans interior was spacious 
and legroom was admirable in all three seating areas front middle 
and rear 
it was relatively easy to move around inside though obviously 
you must hunch over a bit 
the sloping front dashboard design gave an airy feel fit and 
finish was superb the test vehicle had the optional separate air 
conditioner for rearseat passengers another nice touch 
mazda says its target buyers are men but company officials 
expect women to be the primary drivers thats explained by the fact 
that 73 percent of the potential buyers are male with 88 percent 
married the median age is 39 60 percent are college graduates 
the mpv is new there are no trouble index reports from consumer 
reports

the story of a football coach stricken in the 
prime of life by lou gehrigs disease isnt exactly lighthearted 
viewing but pam dawber who plays the coachs wife found the movie 
happy 
its really about the human spirit at its very best she 
said i think he inspires so many people by overcoming his own 
incredible trauma its a hopeful happy movie 
it was soon after dawbers cbs sitcom my sister sam was 
finally dropped for good after bouncing around the schedule for two 
seasons that she was offered the role as lucy wedemeyer in the 
reallife movie quiet victory which cbs will air monday the 
day after christmas 
mrs wedemeyer helps her husband charlie wedemeyer michael 
nouri continue his coaching career despite the disease that leaves 
him unable to speak or move 
dawber had held off new projects until she got final word on my 
sister sam so the movie offer came as she was ready for something 
new the series was onagain offagain on cbs until april 
we all thought we were going back to work on the usa network 
she said tribune entertainment was nearly ready to make 44 new 
shows then it fell through too bad it was a good show but it was 
the victim of network politics 
they wanted our monday night time slot for a new show franks 
place so they ended up killing two shows franks place never 
should have been on at 8 oclock it was a more sophisticated show 
my sister sam was moved to saturday night its second year 
but was soon taken off the air it returned briefly in april as part 
of cbs illfated attempt to program sitcoms on tuesday 
april wasnt all bad for dawber she and husband mark harmon had 
their son sean 
for quiet victory she packed up her new baby and spent 
several weeks filming on folly beach on one of the sea islands off 
south carolina the wedemeyers live in los gatos which is south of 
san francisco but it was too expensive to film there 
so we went to south carolina which has palm trees old houses 
and beaches she said 
wedemeyer was 30 when he learned he had amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis called lou gehrigs disease after the famous new york

on nbcs day by day julia louisdreyfus 
is sort of a onewoman greek chorus she brings the unglad tidings 
to a couple of former yuppies who gave up the good life to run a 
daycare center 
louisdreyfus plays eileen swift a flamboyant stockbroker whos 
a friend of brian harper doug sheehan and his wife kate linda 
kelsey brian had also been a stockbroker and kate a lawyer they 
quit their highpaying jobs to spend more time with their infant 
daughter and teenage son 
eileens a spoilsport who reminds them of what theyre 
missing louisdreyfus said she has great entrances and exits 
that broad can make a joke 
i hope shes a sympathetic character she said my goal is 
to make her sympathetic in spite of herself shes so abrasive i 
hope the audience likes her because she says things everyone wishes 
they could say you see a side of her i dont want to say 
vulnerable a side of her thats warm 
shes a former colleague of brians but they were merely 
friends in this season eileens moved next door so that she can 
pop into the house more easily no matter what she says they remain 
good friends thats a sitcom for you of all the characters in the 
show id say shes the most cartoonlike she says terrible things 
but people dont pay that much attention its just eileen and her 
hijinks 
the sunday night comedy joined the nbc lineup last spring based 
on executive producer gary david goldbergs reallife experiences 
running a daycare center in northern california it also stars 
christopher daniel barnes as the harpers 15yearold son ross and 
courtney thornesmith as kristin the centers beautiful young 
assistant 
louisdreyfus an alumnus of chicagos second city troupe and 
nbcs saturday night live got to know goldberg when she was in 
a spinoff pilot of his family ties the spinoff was never picked 
up as a series 
they were spinning off scott valentines character of nick 
she said i played a character who was similar to eileen she was 
sarcastic but more intellectual than eileen i would never call 
eileen an intellectual 
she recently moved into a new home with her husband writeractor 
brad hall it s a lovely little cottage with a fireplace she 
said were finally getting organized 
louisdreyfus had roles in the movies soul man and hannah 
and her sisters 
i did hannah right at nbc while i was doing saturday night 
live she said i was in the beginning of the film when woody 
allens an executive producer of a television comedy show i was his 
assistant i worked with him for about a week which was fun but 
most of my part was cut out 
this is such a different experience from saturday night 
live she said of the sitcom on saturday night you go to 
work on monday morning and have to write your own material with the 
writers the hours were nuts here you come to work and they hand 
you a script working on a sitcom is as close as you can get to 
having a regular job without having a regular job 
she and her husband were both on saturday night live but 
they had met earlier at northwestern university in chicago 
chicagos a great theater town you dont make a lot of money 
but you dont make any money in theater anyway chicagos a much 
easier place to work and live than new york 
louisdreyfus was born in new york but when her parents divorced 
she divided her time between new york and washington i can 
remember when the eastern shuttle was 18 she said 
i grew up mostly in washington and went to high school with a 
lot of politicans kids my stepfather was a doctor i did every 
play i could get my hands on i grew up trying to juggle my time 
between theater and homework

coded pulses of laser light have begun carrying 
phone calls video signals and computer data beneath the atlantic 
ocean on the first fiberoptic cable connecting the united states 
and europe 
the sharkproof cable that went into service wednesday can carry 
40000 phone calls simultaneously double the capacity of all its 
transatlantic coppercable predecessors combined even though it 
measures less than an inch across 
isaac asimov the prolific author of science and science fiction 
spoke the first official words on the cable in a threeway video 
conference connecting new york london and paris 
welcome everybody to this historic transatlantic crossing 
this maiden voyage across the sea on a beam of light asimov said 
at 1030 am est in the first words spoken over the new cable 
except for test messages 
in a sign of the voracious demand for communications the 
partners in the 361 million project expect the new fiberoptic 
cable to start running out of room by late in 1991 thats when a 
new cable with even more capacity will go into service 
fiberoptic service to japan and the far east will start next 
spring and other undersea fiber links will reach to the caribbean 
and the mediterranean by the early 1990s 
for residential customers the new cable tat8 will mean a 
continued decline in the price of calls transatlantic calls for 
businesses it will mean lower rates and more capacity for the huge 
volume of computer data they transmit especially in the areas of 
finance travel and tourism 
ordinary television broadcasts still will be carried by satellite 
because they would take up too much room on the cable but the 
cables builders expect the cable to be used for video conferences 
between offices with the signals compressed to take up less room 
lasers have revolutionized phone networks by making it possible 
to transmit information in the form of rapid pulses of laser light 
through hairthin strands of glass known as optical fibers the 
lasers transmit information in digital form that is coded into a 
series of ones and zeros 
most longdistance calls within the united states already are 
carried on optical fibers 
the new cable contains six strands of glass and two of them are 
spares the cable measures 08 inch across except for the sections 
that are reinforced against shark bites which are 13 inches across 
the first undersea phone cable between the united states and 
europe tat1 was built in 1956 and could handle 36 simultaneous 
calls during its entire 22year lifetime it handled 10 million 
calls tat8 the tat rhymes with cat can handle that many calls 
in less than two days 
american telephone amp telegraph co owns 341 percent of tat8 
british telecom owns 155 percent and france telecom owns 98 
percent all three of those companies sent cablelaying ships to 
share in the effort the rest of tat8 is owned by 27 other 
telecommunications administrations and companies 
in spite of the huge capacity of fiberoptic cables atampt said 
there is still a role for satellites and it recently signed a 
contract with communications satellite corp expanding its use of 
satellites a comsat spokesman richard mcgraw said other companies 
such as mci communications corp and us sprint communications co 
also had signed longterm contracts for satellite usage 
the cable touches ground in north america at tuckerton nj in 
the united kingdom at widemouth in north cornwall and in france at 
penmarch in brittany it is buried a yard beneath the ocean floor to 
a depth of about 3000 feet so it will not be snagged by fishing 
vessels it is clad in steel to a depth of 8500 feet to protect 
against shark bites 
atampt said 1988 would be the first year the company handled more 
than 1 billion calls into and out of the united states

an 11 percent drop in sales of usmade cars and 
light trucks in early december isnt seen as worrisome in an 
industry flirting with the secondbest calendar year in history 
companies making cars and light trucks in the united states on 
wednesday reported they sold an average of 29610 vehicles during 
the nine selling days in the dec 110 period this year that 
compared with an average of 33251 vehicles sold during the same 
time last year when there also were nine selling days 
the automakers reported that car sales dropped 105 percent and 
light truck sales were down 117 percent in early december of this 
year compared with last year 
but no one was predicting that the numbers pointed to an industry 
in a slump incentives began to work their way back into car deals 
during early december last year after a brief hiatus as the 1988 
model year started 
they automakers started putting on some heavyduty 
incentives in early december last year said analyst kathleen 
heaney of nikko securities co international inc youve got a 
tough time to compare it with 
mary ann sudol of fitch investors agreed 
thats hard to read she said its not surprising that 
theyre down a little bit given that december is bad for auto sales 
anyway 
in any recent 10day period youve had so much noise in the 
period that its hard to make a comparison that noise is 
incentives 
as the year draws to a close the companies are looking forward 
to what could be the secondbest sales year in history behind the 
163 million vehicles sold in 1986 
for the year car and light truck sales in the united states have 
risen 69 percent in 1988 over 1987 going to a daily rate of 37949 
this year compared with 35499 last year 
among the big three us automakers general motors corp showed 
the largest earlydecember decline in car sales falling 129 
percent to a daily rate of 8906 cars in 1988 from 10226 last year 
gms car sales were up 09 percent in 1988 over 1987 to a daily rate 
of 11776 this year compared with 11668 last year 
ford motor cos sales in early december fell 116 percent to a 
daily rate of 5582 this year compared with 6316 in the same 
period last year but for the year fords car sales have climbed 
77 percent to an average daily rate of 7121 in 1988 compared with 
6612 in 1987 
chrysler corp said it sold cars at a daily rate of 2673 in 
early december this year compared with 2979 during the same period 
last year a 103 percent decline so far this year chrysler has 
sold 103 percent more cars with a daily sales rate of 3451 in 
1988 compared with 3130 last year

the price of caesars world inc stock 
rose just hours after the company announced that developer donald 
trump had invested in the gaming company 
at the close of the day wednesday on wall street caesars world 
stock had jumped 412 a share to 2937 in consolidated new york 
stock exchange trading 
the activity led at least one gaming analyst to credit trump with 
being a shrewd investor 
i take my hat off to donald trump said marvin roffman of the 
philadelphia investment firm janney montgomery scott inc it was a 
wise investment to buy into caesars weve always felt caesars 
was one of the bestmanaged companies in the industry and we felt 
it was worth up to 40 a share 
trump has asked the federal government for a ruling on whether 
his investment would violate antitrust laws he filed notice with 
the justice department and the federal trade commission of his 
desire to possibly buy more than 50 percent of caesars world common 
stock 
although neither trump nor caesars world will say how much trump 
already owns the filing was made under the hartscottrodino act 
which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once 
they have acquired at least 15 million worth of stock in a company 
caesars world officials refused comment on trumps notice due 
to the confusing content of this notice according to a statement 
trump also refused to comment wednesday 
such filings are very confidential and hes been advised not to 
comment said susan heilbron a spokeswoman for trump 
caesars world owns three gaming halls caesars hotel casino in 
atlantic city and caesars palace and caesars tahoe in nevada 
in the notice trump said he has the goodfaith intention 
subject to price availability and necessary approvals if any to 
acquire such number of shares to hold in excess of 15 percent of 
the outstanding voting securities of caesars world 
roffman said however that trump would not be successful in a 
hostile takeover of caesars world in a similar situation last year 
involving investor martin sosnoff new jersey gaming regulators 
blocked sosnoffs highly leveraged takeover proposal 
in a similar situation involving trump new jerseys casino 
control commission would probably also reject a highly leveraged 
deal roffman suggested 
donald trumps style is not cash its to borrow the analyst 
said he has accumulated a debt of 1235 billion outstanding on 
his three atlantic city properties 
under new jersey law trump can own only three gaming halls in 
the state so far he is licensed for two trump plaza and trump 
castle casino hotels a third the massive taj mahal is under 
construction and expected to be completed in 1990 
i think hell sell one anyway in the future because it doesnt 
make sense to market three in atlantic city roffman said but 
the bottom line with this caesars notice is that donald trump is 
interested in making money not owning another casino he simply 
bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a 
profit 
this is not the first time that trump has invested in a rival 
casino company 
he made a 30 million profit from investing in holiday corp 
stock and a 24 million profit on bally manufacturing corp stock 
he also bought a small amount of stock in golden nugget corp a 
move that his competitor golden nugget chairman steve wynn called 
a publicity stunt

the dollar moved slightly higher in thin european 
trading late this morning as the market waited for a widely expected 
increase in a key west german interest rate in the wake of a round 
of interest rate increases elsewhere in europe 
gold prices also rose 
traders said an increase in the west german lombard rate is 
likely to be matched by a rise in the us federal reserves 
discount rate 
the lombard rate is what the west german central bank charges 
commercial banks for supplemental borrowings in which securities are 
used as collateral 
the discount rate is what the us central bank charges on loans 
to commercial banks 
there were interest rate hikes in the netherlands belgium and 
france on wednesday 
in london the british pound fell to 18312 compared with 
18335 wednesday

fallen whiz kid barry minkow listened grimly 
as a jury announced guilty 57 times on fraud charges in a 25 
million swindle that snared wall street brokerages major banks and 
small investors 
the 22yearold defendant who launched his zzzz best carpet 
cleaning business in his parents garage at age 16 had been trying 
to make a plea bargain only hours before the us district court 
jury convicted him on all counts of securities credit card and mail 
fraud charges 
the jury rejected minkows claim that he was a frightened young 
boy forced by mobsters into a life of crime and accepted the 
prosecutions portrayal of him as a shrewd young con man with a 
thirst for money power and fame 
minkow could be sentenced to up to 300 years in prison judge 
dickran tevrizian set sentencing for feb 21 
minkows attorney david kenner said he would appeal the 
conviction noting that tevrizian severely limited evidence on 
minkows claims of mob pressure 
the jury was to resume deliberations today on five charges 
against minkows codefendant accountant norman rothberg who is 
accused of taking a bribe to cover up zzzz bests frauds 
minkow sensing he would be convicted had agreed to plead guilty 
to about 15 percent of the charges kenner said outside court 
wednesday 
but assistant us attorney james asperger said no final 
agreement was reached 
the jury which reached its verdict after five days of 
deliberations made such discussions moot 
it took 40 minutes to read the decision minkow fidgeted 
occasionally and reached over once to clasp kenners hand 
the attorney said minkow was remorseful and regretted what had 
happened 
i think hes learned lessons from this kenner said barry 
never wanted anything more than to build zzzz best into the general 
motors of carpet cleaning he clearly was involved with a 
company that was infiltrated by organized crime 
i was just a front man for the mob minkow had insisted on 
the witness stand i was just a puppet 
the youthful defendant told of constant beatings and threats from 
mobsters loan sharks and thugs but there was little corroborating 
evidence 
a duress defense is difficult to establish because threats by 
their very nature are communicated privately kenner said 
in two weeks on the stand during the fourmonth trial minkow 
admitted defrauding numerous investors as well as talk show hosts 
who hailed him as a teenage genius of the finance world 
he admitted making romantic overtures to a woman banker to obtain 
her approval on a loan she testified that she lost her job because 
of him he told of bouncing checks issuing false credit card 
charges and arranging investor tours of restoration projects that 
didnt exist 
dozens of victims who lost money in minkows frauds testified 
after starting his business minkow had claimed zzzz best was 
making a fortune restoring fire and waterdamaged buildings when no 
such jobs were done 
he sold investors on a business that for the most part did not 
exist asperger told jurors 
soon he was a familiar face in tv advertisements and on talk 
shows he wrote a book about his success and took wall street by 
storm when zzzz best went public in 1986 
but the company quickly collapsed in scandal minkow claimed its 
demise was caused by mobsters including the late jack catain who 
turned the business into a swindle 
barry has expressed to me the remorse he has for having been in 
that situation and his desire to become a meaningful member of 
society kenner told reporters 
barry is a young man said kenner i would hope barry would 
still be a young man when he is released

yen on investors fears of possible interest rate hikes abroad 
while stock prices also fell 
trading in both markets was relatively quiet following 
wednesdays report by the us commerce department that showed the 
us trade deficit had dropped only 31 percent in october from the 
previous month to 1035 billion 
the trade figures didnt provide any clear direction for the 
dollar and dealers anticipating possible rate hikes in west 
germany and the united states arent taking any large positions 
said kaneo ogino a dealer at goldman sachs in tokyo 
the dollar closed at 12297 yen down 038 yen from wednesdays 
close 
a moderate selloff pushed the dollar down to 12288 yen at the 
opening but it drifted higher on buying by investment trusts ogino 
said it ranged between 12285 yen and 12305 yen 
the market held a sense of disappointment over the slowed pace 
of improvement in the us trade deficit in recent months though 
the latest figures were within expectations said a dealer at the 
bank of tokyo who spoke anonymously 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues a 15692point gainer wednesday fell 4898 points 
or 016 percent closing at 2970575 
investors finding no incentives for either buying or selling 
remained mostly on the sidelines because of worry over rising 
interest rates traders said 
many investors in both markets are also reluctant to take any new 
positions as the end of the year approaches analysts said 
its a case of the endoftheyear blues said casey 
flaherty a trader at yamaichi securities co 
flaherty said the market lacked new speculative themes 
until we get something new there isnt likely to be much going

dealers said the british government has pushed up interest rates 
sharply in recent months to help quell inflationary pressures 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was up 65 
points or 037 percent at 17626 at about 1230 pm 
the index opened 66 points down on nervousness ahead of the 
release of the earnings figures and amid worries about upward 
pressures on interest rates worldwide the figures showed the 
underlying annual rate of increase in average earnings fell to 9 
percent in october from 925 percent in september and august 
volume was light as 2287 million shares changed hands by midday 
compared with 2636 million shares at the same time on wednesday 
oil shares continued to dominate trading as the market remained 
convinced that london and scottish marine oil had completed the 
longawaited sale of its 252 percent stake in enterprise oil this 
rumor swept the market late wednesday and continued to make the 
rounds thursday 
dealers said both companies share prices rose on relief the deal 
might have finally been completed lasmo shares were up 11 pence at 
474 pence after peaking at 481 while enterprise shares gained 18 
to 534 having been as high as 537 
also in the oil sector news late wednesday that british 
petroleum co was talking exclusively with rtz corp about selling 
most of its minerals business gave a sharp boost to turnover 
especially in bp shares 
bp shares which had risen strongly on rumors ahead of official 
confirmation of the possible sale were down 1 at 258 rtz also 
reversed its recent course and rose 7 to 400 one dealer said price 
changes were a correction to the previous moves but another dealer 
said the transaction which would include the sale of bps gold 
operations could prove a better deal for rtz than for bp

japan air lines said thursday it would consider 
retaliation against united airlines if the us government bans 
sales of jal tickets through computerized reservation and ticketing 
systems in the united states 
we deeply regret the sudden decision by the united states 
neglecting our previous agreements and unilaterally applying 
political pressure to settle this matter the company said in a 
statement 
the us department of transportation has accused jal of 
violating the fair competition rules of the international air 
transport association and called for discussions on whether 
sanctions should be imposed kyodo news service reported from new 
york 
the us embassy in tokyo said thursday it had no details of the 
decision 
the dispute surfaced last summer when jal refused to allow united 
airlines ticketing system to sell jal tickets in japan jal said it 
is not allowed to sell uniteds tickets in the united states and 
thus has the right to refuse sales of jal tickets by united in japan 
if us sanctions are adopted against jal the japanese airlines 
statement said it would appeal to us courts if the sanctions are 
allowed to stand it added we will consider the possibility of 
retaliation against united airlines 
the statement said we believe we reserve the right to choose 
which ticketing system to use based on our commercial judgment and 
thus such a matter should not be settled on a political and 
administrative basis

legal proceedings are under way

five retail stores have sued the state of 
massachusetts for the right of all stores to open during normal 
business hours on dec 26 without having to get local permits 
the stores are challenging state commissioner of labor and 
industries james snows interpretation of a new state law on store 
openings the days after christmas and new years the holidays fall 
on sundays this year 
snow ruled that sunday hours will apply on monday dec 26 that 
means the stores cannot open before noon unless they get permission 
from their local police chiefs and the permits must be confirmed by 
the state 
snow already has said the state will confirm all local permits 
but many local police chiefs have refused to grant them 
the suit was filed wednesday in suffolk superior court by 
filenes filenes basement lord amp taylor caldor and lechmere 
permits to open before noon have been granted by police chiefs in 
auburn boston danvers hanover newton peabody westborough 
westfield and worcester 
permits have been denied by chiefs in belmont braintree 
brockton burlington cambridge dedham framingham hyannis 
natick springfield and wellesley 
the retailers reluctantly decided to take this action primarily 
for customerservice reasons said boston lawyer dawnmarie 
driscoll 
on the day after christmas customers appear early to make 
exchanges to use gift certificates and to take advantage of 
afterchristmas sales 
retailers would lose a lot of customer goodwill by being open 
in some locations and being closed in others 
under state law when some holidays including christmas occur 
on sundays they are observed on the following mondays 
a change in the law passed last month and agreed to by a 
coalition of retailers and unions allows retailers to open jan 1 
and jan 2 and dec 26 but not dec 25 
but the wording of the change is open to interpretation 
retailers and some legislators said they thought it meant stores 
could be open during usual weekday hours other said they thought it 
meant sunday hours would apply

the european economic community thursday 
ordered eec member states to deregulate by 1991 the 
telecommunications services industry in a move that is likely to 
meet national opposition 
the decision was taken by the executive european commission 
unilaterally under the eec founding treaty which allows it to impose 
legislation to stop public monopolies distorting competition 
a similar move earlier this year to break national 
telecommunications authorities monopolies in the consumer equipment 
market is being challenged in the european court of justice by 
france supported by west germany italy and belgium 
the latest order would open up to private competition services 
such as data transmission leased lines electronic mail and 
financial data networks in stages by january 1991 
the commission said in a statement that national 
telecommunications monopolies in certain countries restricted 
clients use of infrastructure and charged disproportionate 
prices for services in relation to cost these measures limited the 
supply of telecommunications services it said 
it said that telecommunications services were growing fast and 
predicted that data transmission services would grow by 15 to 25 
percent a year once the market was deregulated 
the value of the telecommunications services market in the eec is 
estimated at about 64 billion european currency units or 755 
billion 
the commission will not put its order into effect immediately it 
will consult with the member states on the terms of the legislation 
before giving the final goahead in march 
the commission also proposed draft eec legislation to set common 
conditions for open access by private operators to public 
telecommunications networks

the illinois supreme court today threw 
out a 200000 libel verdict stemming from a 1980 editorial in the 
belleville ill newsdemocrat that said a county board chairman 
lied about his stand on a tax increase 
without written dissent the justices said the editorial 
attacking thenst clair county board chairman jerry costello was 
false and libelous but that costellos lawyer didnt prove the 
newspapers editors had reason to believe it was false when they 
published it 
as a result the high court said costello failed to meet the 
actual malice test for libel claims by public officials that 
the statement was made with the knowledge that it was false or a 
reckless disregard for the truth 
failure to investigate does not itself establish actual malice 
if the editors did not seriously doubt the truth of their 
assertions justice daniel ward wrote in the courts opinion 
costello who was elected this fall to the us house of 
representatives filed the lawsuit against capital cities 
communications inc owner of the newspaper and richard hargraves 
the editorialpage editor who wrote the editorial 
the case gained national attention in 1984 when hargraves was 
jailed briefly for refusing to reveal the names of people he said 
were confidential sources for the editorial 
the newspaper endorsed costello in his 1980 campaign for county 
board chairman saying he had promised to vigrously oppose any new 
taxes without approval by voter referendum 
after the election the county board approved a creation of a 
mass transit district with taxing powers and the newspaper blasted 
costello in a scathing editorial 
jerry costello lied to us and when he lied to us he lied 
to you the editorial said in part 
costello filed a libel lawsuit against the newspaper claiming 
that he had lobbied against the measure but as the boards presiding 
officer was barred by law from speaking or voting on the issue when 
a roll call was taken 
the lawsuit initially was dismissed by a circuit judge but a 
trial was ordered by a state appellate court costello was awarded 
600000 in punitive damages and 450000 in compensatory damages 
after the trial judge found that the editorials statements were 
false and malicious 
on appeal a divided illinois appellate court panel upheld the 
verdict for costello but threw out the punitive damage award and 
reduce the compensatory award to 200000 the majority opinion 
called the editorial unduly harsh and vicious 
however dissenting appellate judge robert steigmann wrote that 
the majority decision constitutes a threat to one of our most 
important freedoms the freedom of the press to criticize 
vigorously and even unpleasantly public officials in the execution 
of their official duties

west germanys central bank 
boosted a key interest rate 05 percentage points to help prevent 
inflation from flaring up but a top official said the move 
shouldnt be considered part of a coordinated international rate 
hike 
the bundesbank raised the lombard lending rate to 55 percent 
from 5 percent effective friday but it kept the discount rate 
unchanged at 35 percent 
the lombard rate is what the central bank charges on loans to 
commercial banks when securities are used as collateral the 
discount rate is the main commercial bank loan 
bundesbank officials said the change in the lombard rate came in 
response to concerns about rising inflation 
we are in an environment of slightly rising interest rates 
said bundesbank president karl otto poehl 
he said the economy is in a process which one can call a 
boom and that a tighter monetary policy is appropriate 
poehl also referred to interest rate developments in the united 
states great britain and other european countries but he stressed 
that the lombard rate hike should not be seen as a concerted 
interest rate increase

an ohio natural gas producer has won a 600 
million damage judgment against a tenneco inc subsidiary but 
tenneco quickly said it would appeal the jury award 
the 12member jury on wednesday ruled that tennecos tennessee 
gas pipeline subsidiary broke a contract to buy natural gas from 
floyd kimble coowner of red hill oil co of dover ohio 
the jury awarded actual damages of about 250 million plus 
interest and punitive damages of 350 million according to tenneco 
officials 
the verdict followed three days of deliberations and capped a 
4month trial in wharton before state district judge daniel r 
sklar who still must approve the verdict 
houstonbased tenneco issued a statement saying it was 
disappointed with the verdict and would appeal it 
im amazed shocked astonished said walter sapp 
tennecos general counsel i find it totally incredible 
the verdict stemmed from a suit the tiny company filed against 
tenneco in december 1985 that alleged tenneco broke a contract it 
had to buy certain volumes of gas tenneco spokeswoman ma shute 
said 
kimble was represented by houston attorneys john oquinn and al 
deaton who were not available for comment wednesday 
the wall street journal on thursday quoted kimbles wife doris 
who is coowner of red hill as saying of the court challenge we 
felt we had valid reasons as individuals to seek fulfillment of the 
contract 
according to a statement issued by a dallas public relations firm 
representing oquinn the litigation stemmed from a practice by 
pipeline companies when oil and gas prices were higher of making 
contracts guaranteeing producers that the companies would buy their 
gas at fair market prices 
sapp said the two sides had a wide dispute regarding the 
amount of gas tennessee gas was obliged to buy from kimble he did 
not have the specific amounts of gas each side claimed it had agreed 
to buy 
kimble claimed tennessee gas broke its contract in 1983 but sapp 
said the company was acting on a provision in the contract that 
allowed it to buy less gas under certain circumstances

agreement today on staggering flights in an attempt to reduce delays 
american airlines and united airlines worked out some tentative 
scheduling arrangements for evening flights on wednesday and were 
tackling the morning flight schedule at ohare today officials said 
the discussions under the direction of the federal aviation 
administration were being conducted at a hotel near washington any 
agreement must be approved by the faa 
the scheduling changes which often involve shifting flight 
schedules only slightly would not go into effect until march 
the faa recently directed a reduction in the maximum number of 
flights per hour at ohare the countrys busiest airport because 
of concerns that air traffic controllers were being asked to handle 
too many planes during some peak periods 
this year there has been a sharp increase in controller errors 
involving air traffic in the chicago area 
faa spokesman dick stafford said the twoday meeting was expected 
to produce a scheduling arrangement between american and united 
which together account for about 60 percent of the flights at ohare 
nothing at this point has been decided said stafford adding

ford motor co has developed an 
inexpensive catalytic converter the automaker says is as effective 
as platinum in meeting exhaust emissions standards 
ford chairman donald e petersen told the pittsburgh high 
technology council on wednesday that the automaker is installing the 
new converter on some 1989 cars 
to appreciate the full implications of this patented 
development you must understand that at least some platinum a 
very expensive and scarce metal has always been required in the 
past to reduce tailpipe emissions to meet government standards 
petersen said 
the idea for the converter evolved from fords use of theme 
groups to develop new automotive technologies and adapt them to 
the assembly line petersen said 
ford spokesman bill peacock declined today to reveal any details 
about the new device or the material in it he said it would cost 
significantly less to produce but was not specific and did not say 
how much of the savings would be passed on to the consumer 
peacock said if successful the new device would not be put into 
the general manufacturing process until after the 1989 model year

international business machines corp 
said thursday it decided to extend a 1984 antitrust settlement that 
requires the computer giant to give certain technical information to 
competitors in europe 
the us company and the european economic community said in a 
statement that the accord has come to serve as an effective 
vehicle for resolving questions on how competing machines can be 
hooked up to ibm equipment 
the 1984 settlement suspended a 4year antitrust case brought by 
the 12nation trading bloc against ibm 
ibm was allowed under the agreement the right to give starting 
jan 1 a years notice that it would end the arrangement that 
meant the arrangement could have expired as early as jan 1 1990 
the agreement makes it easier for other companies to compete with 
ibm by setting out a time schedule for release of certain data 
generally within four months to enable competing equipment to 
interconnect with hardware and software for ibms largescale system 
370 mainframe computers 
by extending the agreement ibm avoided an uproar among europeans 
who dislike the dominance of an americanbased company in the 
european computer market the agreement is relatively painless to 
ibm and has not cut into its share of the market 
the statement said the community and the company decided that 
neither foresees any change in circumstances that would cause 
ibm to use its termination right 
however should such circumstances arise ibm has agreed to 
review the matter with the eec prior to giving any notice the 
statement said 
jeanfrancois verstrynge an official in the communitys 
competition department said ibm and the eec have agreed that 
they do not foresee that at the present time such special 
circumstances will occur the special conditions were not 
specified 
the move to extend the agreement he said was prompted by 
concern the computer market would suffer from fear uncertainty 
and doubt if ibm had the power to give notice at any time 
it was to eliminate this uncertainy that the extension was 
sought he told reporters 
ibm is in terms of revenue the largest computer vendor in 
europe as well as worldwide 
verstrynge said the eecs competition chief peter sutherland 
met on dec 1 with c michael armstrong president of ibm europe to 
discuss a continuation of the accord 
it was an easy meeting verstrynge said but mr sutherland 
was totally determined 
the trading bloc will continue reviewing the agreement annually 
he said 
an ibm spokesman in paris who demanded anonymity said the 
arrangement does achieve the intended objective of providing a 
means through which the company can provide data to competitors 
he said that from august 1984 to last june 30 the computer firm 
received 66 requests from 20 competitors covering 703 questions 
verstrynge said prior to the agreement ibm could announce a new 
piece of equipment without releasing technical details 
the competitors could not react with competing products or 
services because they didnt have the technical information he 
said

a former bank president accused of leaking 
confidential interest rate data while he was a director of the new 
york federal reserve bank pleaded innocent thursday to insider 
trading charges 
robert a rough was arraigned before us district judge 
dickinson r debevoise one week after being indicted by a federal 
grand jury here 
rough was accused of leaking information on the discount rate set 
by the federal reserve bank in washington to principals at bevill 
bresler amp schulman inc a livingston nj brokerage firm that 
later collapsed 
the government alleged that bevill bresler made millions of 
dollars and avoided millions in losses because of the information 
which rough allegedly exchanged for 47000 in interestfree loans 
roughs attorney michael himmel said he would need time to 
review thousands of transactions by the firm which collapsed in 
april 1985 
debevoise on thursday set roughs bail at a 150000 personal 
recognizance bond 
a hearing on pretrial motions was set for feb 14 and trial was 
scheduled for feb 21 
after thursdays hearing himmel and rough declined to comment 
authorities have called roughs case the first insider trading 
involving government securities and the federal reserve system 
the indictment said that while he was president of the national 
bank of sussex county in branchville and sat on the new york feds 
board from 1982 to 1984 rough regularly leaked word on the new york 
feds discount rate recommendation to the national fed as well as 
the feds final determination on the rate 
changes in the discount rate the interest on fed loans to 
commercial banks have a powerful impact on the securities markets 
fed officials have called action involving the rate one of their 
most closely guarded secrets 
discount rate changes widely are regarded as the strongest 
indication the fed makes of the direction it wants to push interest 
rates which affect the price of debt securities such as bonds 
after the fed learned of the allegations against rough which 
first were mentioned in april 1987 during testimony of a criminal 
trial stemming from the bevill bresler collapse it tightened 
procedures regarding the rate 
rough formally was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and 
securities fraud two counts of bank fraud one count each of wire 
fraud and securities fraud and two counts of making false statements 
to banks 
rough resigned from sussex national earlier this year 
prosecutors said

share prices closed higher thursday on the london 
stock exchange boosted by news that british wage growth slowed in 
october and by some speculative buying of several major stocks 
dealers said overall trading volume remained low with activity 
concentrated in a few of the leading shares affected by takeover 
speculation or special situations 
other share prices were higher in thin volume as the reported 
slowdown in british average earnings reduced fears that british 
interest rates would have to be increased again to curb inflation 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index closed up 71 
points or 04 percent at 17632 near the session peak 
volume was a modest 3962 million shares down from 4471 million 
shares a day earlier 
early in the trading session the market remained in negative 
territory preoccupied with evidence of an upward drift in world 
interest rates 
but the market turned around after the government reported that 
the underlying annual rate of increase in average earnings fell to 9 
percent in october from 925 percent in september and august 
most market forecasts had been for the rate to show no change on 
the month while some analysts called for faster growth

the dollar rose in europe on thursday after an 
expected increase in a key west german interest rate failed to 
bolster the west german mark 
gold and silver prices fell in busy trading pulled down by a 
selloff in platinum sparked by ford motor cos announcement that 
it had developed a catalytic converter that didnt use the metal 
dealers said speculation that the us federal reserve would 
follow the west german bundesbanks move by boosting the us 
discount rate helped the dollar 
dealers widely had discounted the bundesbanks move to raise its 
key lombard lending rate by 05 percentage point to 55 percent but 
many market players had held on to marks rather than dollars in 
hopes that the move would boost the mark further against the us 
currency 
when such a rise did not materialize dealers sold their marks 
for dollars and other currencies 
the move was predicted and there wasnt enough reaction to 
it one dealer said 
the lombard rate is the interest the west german central bank 
charges commercial banks for supplemental borrowings in which 
securities are used as collateral the discount rate is what the 
federal reserve charges on loans to commercial banks 
the west german rate hike followed rate hikes on wednesday and 
thursday by the central banks of france belgium and the netherlands 
and austria 
in london the british pound dipped to 18280 from 18335 on 
wednesday 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late wednesdays 
rates included 17485 west german marks up from 17365 14725 
swiss francs up from 14630 59745 french francs up from 59350 
19665 dutch guilders up from 19590 128800 italian lire up 
from 127950 and 12054 canadian dollars up from 11986 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 038 yen to a closing 12297 yen later in london 
the dollar was quoted at 12335 yen 
a wave of platinum selling was sparked by reports that ford motor 
co chairman donald petersen said his company had developed a 
catalyst that was just as effective as platinum in meeting stringent 
exhaust emissions standards but was significantly less expensive 
platinum tumbled to 565 an ounce at the close in zurich down 
from wednesdays close of 600 an ounce and the session high of 601 
gold fell in london to a late bid of 41645 a troy ounce 
compared with 42075 bid late wednesday in zurich gold closed at

grain futures prices closed modestly higher 
thursday on the chicago board of trade amid rumors that the soviet 
union may have purchased up to 2 million metric tons of us corn 
but soybean futures declined on the lack of confirmation of a 
rumored sale of soybean meal to the soviets analysts said 
the corn market has been strong all week on persistent rumors 
that the soviet union was in the market for a large amount of us 
corn and sorghum 
those rumors intensified thursday with some observers saying 
they believed the sale already had been completed 
it is very likely that the sale has already gone through and 
were just waiting for official confirmation said ted mao a 
grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
it wouldnt surprise me to see some sort of confirmation come 
in the next 24 to 48 hours he said 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 428 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 1 cents higher with december at 268 a bushel oats 
were cent to 2 cents higher with december at 213 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with january at 775 a

snow falls silently on the michigan 
battlefield as tim schmuckal inspects the ranks of christmas tree 
soldiers 
scotch pine blue spruce and douglas fir are destined for all 
points of the united states to meet their artificial foe the 
plastic christmas tree 
im worried about that says the 18yearold schmuckal 
shaking the snow from his brown hair 
theyre saying that 42 percent 48 percent of people are 
buying artificial trees he said 
with a year of college under his belt schmuckal isnt sure there 
is enough future in his fathers northwestern lower peninsula 
christmas tree farm for him to take the same trade 
the national christmas tree association expects americans will 
buy 341 million natural trees this holiday while about 30 million 
people will put up artificial ones 
there are other problems the summer drought killed 2000 young 
trees at the schmuckal farm flooding hurt michigans 1986 harvest 
and an increase in smallscale growers threatens to undercut the 
market 
but growers say those woes are sideline skirmishes from the 
handworked 400 acres at the schmuckal tree farm in northern 
michigan to the helicopterharvested operations of the nations 
largest christmas tree growers it is fake trees that are hurting a 
1 billionayear business the most 
the market share for artificial trees has continued increasing 
despite a 218 percent jump in natural tree sales the past 11 years 
only 20 years ago fewer than 20 percent of the holiday trees were 
artificial 
we cant ship artificial trees fast enough said terrence 
hayes vice president of the american tree co in pittsburgh the 
trees are looking more like real trees each year and increased 
prices dont make any difference they still sell 
artificial trees offer durability safety and variety their 
sponsors say they come in metallic pink shimmering silver or 
decorated with feathers they come in symmetrical green perfection 
but they dont smell christmas and theyre expensive 
said barry brand executive secretary of the michigan christmas tree 
growers association 
artificial trees also are causing problems for others a charity 
lot in saginaw that once sold about 2000 trees to raise money for 
st georges catholic church now reports sales of 1400 
individual tree growers are doing what they can to compete 
pushing quality control programs and improving tree strains 
most trees are stained green before cutting to give them a good 
color farms like the schmuckal operation prune the crop into 
classic cones by hand while some bigger operations airlift the 
harvest by helicopter so the trees wont lose needles from being 
dragged on the ground or hauled in a truck 
but the biggest push came just this year when the 
milwaukeebased national christmas tree association declared war 
against fake trees with a 1 million promotional campaign 
about threefourths of the money is committed to television 
commercials featuring nbc weatherman willard scott extolling pine 
needles over plastic 
michigan which supplied this years capitol hill christmas tree 
has inaugurated its own promotion with a quality control program 
select trees that meet specifications are bestowed with a michigan 
snowfresh tag before being loaded onto trucks headed for florida 
new york mexico and canada 
were trying to build up michigan theres something about 
michigan we have the soils brand said 
oregon growers would disagree said don becker spokesman for the 
national christmas tree association said both states ship out about 
6 million trees a year and claim to lead the nation 
we dont get into it and just say the two states are the top 
producers becker said 
back on his fathers farm tim schmuckal isnt certain michigan 
can do for christmas trees what idaho did for potatoes too few 
trees bear the tag and the bulk of what consumers find in hometown 
parking lots show no origin at all 
the national association is not concerned that programs such as 
snowfresh have that impact any cut tree is desirable becker 
said just get out there and get one he said

the number of us business failures fell by 63 
percent during the first three quarters of this year the best 
performance in nearly a decade according to a private survey 
released thursday 
the number of business failures fell to 44793 from 47794 in the 
first nine months of 1987 the report by dun amp bradstreet corp 
stated 
joseph duncan dun amp bradstreets corporate economist said the 
decline was larely attributable to decreases in the levels of 
failures in the oil and agricultural states 
agricultural business failures fell 549 percent duncan said the 
number of agricultural failures soared in 1987 when farmers took 
advantage of new protections under the federal bankruptcy law the 
rush to benefit from the new provisions subsided this year leading 
to the drop in failures in that industry 
the only industry to see an increase in failures was wholesale 
trade where 54 percent more companies failed during the first nine 
months of this year than in the same period a year earlier 
in other industries mining failures fell 255 percent 
transportation and utility failures were off 78 percent retail 
failures were off 66 percent financial insurance and real estate 
failures fell 34 percent failures of service companies were down 
18 percent construction failures were off 14 percent and 
manufacturing failures were essentially unchanged

the european economic community said 
thursday it will hold talks next month with japan in an effort to 
open japans dairy market to more imports 
the 12nation trading bloc would like japan to ease measures that 
it says protect the local dairy industry from foreign competition 
the japanese market for table cheese amounts to about 120000 
metric tons a year with imports from the european trading group 
accounting for some 27000 tons 
the study found that sales of european dairy products in japan 
were hindered by import quotas on cream butter powdered whey and 
condensed and powdered milk 
it also said japan maintains a 35 percent tariff on processed and 
natural cheeses and limits the opening of large supermarkets that 
are the main outlets for sales of imported cheese 
moreover it said exporters were faced with long delays at 
customs offices and discriminatory labeling rules 
as a result european community officials should press japan to 
slash the tariff on imported cheese ease restrictions on expansion 
of supermarkets and shift government subsidies from production to 
promotion and consumer education the study indicated 
the study found that japans per capita consumption of dairy 
products is one of the lowest among industrialized nations

national semiconductor corp on thursday announced a 252 
million net loss during its second fiscal quarter and company 
officials blamed the loss on a sharp decline in bookings and sales 
and a weak semiconductor market 
the results contrasted sharply with those of another chip maker 
micron technology inc which said late wednesday the profits in its 
first fiscal quarter nearly quadrupled 
national semiconductor of santa clara calif said its loss was 
in contrast to a net profit of 116 million or 8 cents a share a 
year earlier analysts were expecting the losses noting that the 
company faced a squeeze on pricing because of intense competition in 
its markets 
sales for the second quarter which ended nov 27 were 7053 
million compared to 640 million for the same quarter last year 
for the first half of fiscal year 1989 sales were 135 billion 
with a net loss of 557 million sales in the same period of 1988 
were 115 billion with net earnings of 251 million or 19 cents 
per share 
micron technology of boise idaho did better because it makes 
computer memory chips which are priced highly because of short 
supplies it earned 322 million on revenue of 1104 million 
during the quarter that ended dec 1 last year micron earned 84 
million on revenue of 432 million 
pershare earnings were 88 cents for the quarter compared to 33 
cents per share a year ago 
however both income and revenue were down from the last quarter 
of microns 1988 fiscal year when the company had a record 
quarterly profit 
the declines were due largely to a higher effective tax rate and 
costs associated with hiring new employees said kipp bedard 
manager of investor relations in addition the company has been 
setting money for legal expenses 
in november texas instruments filed a patent infringement 
lawsuit against micron texas instruments alleges that micron is 
producing memory chips that disregard tis patents

commercial credit group incs 165 
billion cash and stock buyout of primerica corp was approved 
overwhelmingly by shareholders of both companies on thursday 
despite criticism by some primerica workers and shareholders of big 
severance payments for the companys executives 
i only wish the powers that protected the executive board would 
have protected the employees a little more said lorraine cheney 
a primerica employee for three years 
cheney and some others said their benefits have been cut while 
top executives of primerica are receiving severance payments called 
golden parachutes that reportedly total about 98 million 
under the buyout shareholders will receive one share of 
commercial credit common stock plus 7 in cash for each share of 
primerica 
based on thursdays closing price the deal is worth 2825 a 
share in cash and stock primerica closed at 28 a share on the new 
york stock exchange 
the combined companies will operate under the primerica name 
primerica a greenwichbased financial services and directmarketing 
company is the parent of smith barney harris upham amp co the 
investment firm it acquired in 1987 for 750 million 
separately smith barney on thursday announced the layoffs of 120 
employees due to soft business conditions 
baltimorebased commercial credit is involved in consumer credit 
including lending property and casualty insurance and credit cards 
shareholders for both companies approved the merger on thursday 
primerica shareholders voted in stamford while commercial credit 
shareholders met in new york 
primericas proxy statement does not give a total figure for the 
severance payment package for its top executives but published 
reports have put the figure at about 98 million 
primerica spokespeople declined to discuss the figure because 
some shareholders have filed lawsuits against the company and its 
directors in an attempt to stop the merger 
the proxy does say that primerica chairman gerald tsai jr will 
receive 192 million in cash 86 million to cover excise taxes 
and 104 million relating to cancellation of stock options 
the proxy also reports that tsai who will be the new companys 
largest individual shareholder and director and chairman of the 
boards executive committee will receive an annual fee of 250000 
office space staff plust business expenses 
i can only tell you it is our judgment that this merger is in 
the best interest of the shareholders tsai said 
tsai also said he could not discuss the golden parachutes because 
the matter is in litigation but he told one shareholder who 
complained that 93 percent of the shareholders voted in favor of the 
merger so i guess youre in the minority

when ivan boesky returns to his mansion 
after serving time for insider trading there wont be a 
jeffersonian dome to greet him 
the north castle zoning board of appeals voted 32 wednesday 
night to deny a request from boeskys wife seema to cap her 
17room georgian home in mount kisco with a dome similar to the one 
that tops thomas jeffersons monticello home in charlottesville va 
mrs boeskys plans were opposed by 11 neighbors 
she needed special permission from the board because her plans 
would have added a third floor to the house which is at the center 
of a 76acre estate called northview 
north castle zoning law limits buildings to 2 stories 
those voting against the proposal said approval would have set an 
undesirable precedent those supporting the dome said it would have 
had little impact 
boesky paid a record 100 million fine in 1986 to settle federal 
securities and exchange commission charges of insider stock trading 
and is serving a threeyear prison term after pleading guilty in 
april 1987 to a federal conspiracy charge boesky will be eligible 
for parole in march

the dollar strengthened thursday after a west 
german interest rate hike failed to hurt the us currency and led 
money dealers to assume the us federal reserve would tighten 
credit in this country 
gold prices dropped as much as 860 an ounce in new york in 
reaction to tumbling platinum prices a result of fears that the 
world automobile industry demand for platinum could dwindle 
precious metals historically move in the same direction 
currency strategists said the west german bundesbanks hike in a 
key lending rate from 5 percent to 55 percent raised speculation 
that the us central bank would raise its discount rate the loan 
fee to financial institutions which as of thursday stood at 65 
percent a higher us rate would tend to make dollardenominated 
holdings worth more 
currency dealers also said the west german banks move had 
generated optimism that the west german mark would riseas well but 
when the mark did not rise as expected speculators sold it and 
bought dollars instead 
in tokyo the dollar fell 038 japanese yen to 12297 yen later

bond prices slipped thursday and a key shortterm 
interest rate rose as traders puzzled over whether the federal 
reserve had taken steps to boost interest rates 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond fell 332 point or about 
1 for every 1000 in face value its yield edged up to 905 
percent from 904 percent late wednesday 
trading volume was light as investors sorted through the 
available evidence on the economys strength and the central banks 
likely reaction to the growth some analysts expect the fed will 
tighten credit for fear that the pace of economic growth will 
rekindle inflation 
economic reports this week indicated only a moderate decline in 
the nations trade imbalance in october while industrial production 
the industrial operating rate and retail sales all rose in november 
traders also pointed to the west german central banks hike in 
one of its key lending rates wednesday as increasing chances that 
the fed may do the same 
higher interest rates depress the prices on outstanding bond 
issues 
an important us lending rate the federal funds rate rose as 
high as 9 percent on thursday before settling at 8 percent late in 
the day up from 8 percent late wednesday 
the federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each 
other for shortterm loans and the federal reserve can influence 
the level of the rate indirectly by buying or selling government 
securities in the open market 
some traders concluded that when the fed failed to do so at its 
traditional midday juncture while the federal funds rate was 
trading at 8 percent that the central bank had indeed tightened 
its credit polciy 
but others were not convinced they noted that thursday was a 
corporate tax payment deadline and said that may have resulted in a 
drain on bank reserves forcing banks to borrow money 
robert brusca chief economist for nikko securities 
international said he doubts the fed is going to tighten in a 
clear noticeable way 
i dont see any reason to do it the economy has shown we can 
get a suprising amount of growth without inflation and i dont think 
the feds board of governors wants to stand in the way of that 
brusca said 
meanwhile interest rates on 52week treasury bills rose in 
thursdays auction to the highest level for such a sale in 3 years 
the treasury department sold 90 billion of the bills at an 
average discount rate of 849 percent up from 792 percent at the 
last auction on nov 17 and the highest since 924 percent on march 
14 1985 
in the secondary market for treasury issues prices of shortterm 
government issues were down 332 point intermediate governments 
fell 116 point and 20year issues lost 116 point according to 
telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer fell 068 to 112978 
in corporate trading industrials were down moodys investment 
grade corporate bond index which measures price movements on 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer fell 083 
to 29295 
in the taxexempt market prices lost 116 point according to 
the bond buyers index of 40 activelytraded municipal issues 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 845 percent while 
the discount rose 7 basis points to 817 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills fell to 868 percent as the discount slipped 10 
basis points to 822 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 916 
percent as the discount rose 5 basis points to 849 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity

the state legislature voted unanimously 
thursday to temporarily restore to corporations in new york a weapon 
to fight hostile takeover attempts by other companies 
the measure validating the use of socalled poison pills was 
approved 1290 by the state assembly and 520 by the senate and sent 
to gov mario cuomos desk the legislation a product of 
negotiations involving the governors office is expected to quickly 
be signed into law by cuomo 
the measure is designed to undo until april 1 1989 the result 
of a state supreme court ruling earlier this year in which a poison 
pill that irving bank corp tried to use to fend off a hostile 
takeover by bank of new york co was ruled illegal 
that court decided new york state laws prohibit the inequitable 
treatment of shareholders that cleared the way for bank of new 
yorks acquisition and raised concerns among the more than 100 
companies in new york that have poison pill rules in place as 
protection against hostile suitors 
under the poison pill scenario a target company gives 
shareholders the right to buy additional stock at reduced prices 
when an outside party buys up a certain percentage of the companys 
shares that makes it far more expensive for a suitor to buy enough 
stock to get a controlling interest in the target company 
the poison pill is designed chiefly to give a company time to 
fend off an unfriendly takeover if it chooses or to negotiate a 
better price for its shareholders if it goes along with a buyout 
offer 
the senate sponsor of the bill richard schermerhorn rorange 
said the republicancontrolled senate originally favored validating 
the poison pills for 18 months but he said that time period was 
reduced due to opposition in the democratic assembly 
a special task force made up of business leaders and others is in 
charge of studying the use of poison pills and other aspects of the 
merger and acquisition field and will report to the legislature by 
early spring 
schermerhorn said hed been told there were billions of dollars 
out there that could be used in acquisitions and that some effort 
must be made to head off the wholesale buying and selling of 
companies 
state sen franz leichter a manhattan democrat who voted for 
the measure said poison pills are sometimes used by corporate 
management to keep itself in control he said that can lead to 
what he called abuses 
poison pills really are a way of changing the rules in the 
middle of a game he said

a federal appeals court on thursday ruled that 
the leasing of two corn wet milling plants in iowa by nabisco brands 
inc to archerdanielsmidland co in 1982 was a violation of the 
sherman antitrust act 
the government had claimed in a suit filed in december 1982 that 
the lease created an unreasonable restraint of trade because it 
would give adm a large enough share of the high fructose corn syrup 
hfcs market to control the price of the product 
in the early 1970s new technology allowed the processing by wet 
corn milling plants of certain corn syrups into a substitute for 
sugar in sweetening various products including canned fruits and 
soft drinks 
the suit noted that since 1934 sugar cane and beet sugar growers 
have benefitted from either direct subsidies or sugar price supports 
enacted by congress because of the price supports the price of 
hfcs has been substantially lower than the price of sugar for many 
years 
the government presented evidence that if the lease between adm 
and nabisco was consummated adm would be able because of its newly 
established market position to raise the price of hfcs to a level 
just below the price of sugar 
the companies however were granted a summary judgment in the 
case in us district court in iowa that court agreed that sugar 
and hfcs are in the same relevant product market and that adms 
share of that market was not sufficient to constitute a violation of 
the sherman act or the clayton act 
in its 21 decision thursday a panel of the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals ruled however that while sugar and hfcs are 
functionally interchangeable they are not reasonably 
interchangeable because of the price differential between the two 
products and therefore are not in the same relevant product market 
the majority on the appeals court panel comprised judges gerald 
w heaney and theodore mcmillian 
dissenting was judge donald r ross who said he agreed with the 
district courts decision that hfcs and sugar belong in the same 
relevant product market

brewery workers at adolph coors co have 
voted overwhelmingly against union representation by the teamsters 
a spokeswoman for the brewery said thursday night 
results of the two days of balloting on union representation were 
announced by pam crider a brewery spokeswoman 
of the 1562 eligible workers at the brewery 1081 voted 
against union representation while 413 voted for the union she 
said 
brewery workers have decided that they dont want union 
representation said john meadows director of community relations 
for coors coors will continue to work to maintain highquality 
relationships among its work force without thirdparty 
representation 
the international brotherhood of teamsters switched a live 
telephone in golden to a recording after the vote was announced 
the vote followed 18 months of union and company politicking at 
the brewery the nations fourth largest 
the teamsters needed a simple majority to win representation for 
the 1600 coors brewery workers 
the brewery has been nonunion since december 1978 when workers 
voted overwhelmingly to withdraw from the aflcio after a bitter 
20month strike 
the strike had been effectively broken and triggered a nationwide 
organized labor boycott of coors products that boycott officially 
ended in august 1987 with an agreement between coors and the aflcio 
and including the teamsters 
an agreement between coors and the teamsters stipulated that win 
or lose there will be no return to the boycott against coors 
products 
voting began wednesday when 126 brewery workers who had thursday 
off voted it continued at three locations at the brewery on 
thursday said meadows 
key issues in the election included wages and pensions the 
teamsters have touted the wages recently implemented and the pension 
plan under consideration by anheuser busch cos new brewery in fort 
collins colo 
coors officials have warned employees not to count on those wage 
and pension levels even if the teamsters win saying busch is four 
times as large as coors and can afford salaries and benefits that 
coors cannot 
coors chairman bill coors addressing workers monday in a series 
of meetings at the brewery rejected the teamsters claims that a 
union victory would boost sales at coors which last year shipped 
156 million barrels of beer and expects to sell 17 million barrels 
this year 
teamsters brewery division chief david laughton has said the 
union label would make coors more palatable to many consumers and 
boost sales as much as 10 percent 
but robert s weinberg a beer industry analyst in st louis 
said the vote wont affect coors sales one way or another 
a nonunion workforce is going to cost the company some 
business similarly a union workforce could cost some sales the 
question is is it a significant amount of business he asked 
the election was being conducted independently of the national 
labor relations board university of denver prof tom watkins an 
experienced labor arbitrator was acting as the independent monitor 
coors reported thirdquarter beer shipments of 557 million 
barrels up 81 percent from the same period a year earlier and net 
earnings for the period of 2164 million up marginally from a year 
earlier
