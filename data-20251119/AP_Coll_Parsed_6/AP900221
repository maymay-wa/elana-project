the air force lacks an accurate accounting 
system similar to those in private industry that could forecast 
problems in its billions of dollars of weapons purchases according 
to a draft report by congressional investigators 
the washington post said in thursday editions that an early 
draft of the report said the air force had grossly understated 
the cost of major weapons systems by tens of billions of dollars 
over the past decade 
it said costs of frontline warplanes were understated by 27 
billion from 1975 to 1988 and 18 billion in unneeded equipment 
was purchased 
the air force is now spending about 14 billion a year buying 
aircraft of all kinds 
a source at the general accounting office whose analysts 
prepared the report said the severely critical comments of the 
draft obtained by the newspaper might have been toned down somewhat 
in later drafts 
in comments included in the report the air force largely 
concurs with the overall assessment by the gao investigators that 
its system has problems the gao source said speaking on condition 
on anonymity 
the newspaper quoted an air force statement as saying the report 
creates a faulty impression of waste and mismanagement 
the gao source said the document should not be taken to mean 
they dont have any financial control over systems purchases 
the report makes more than 20 recommendations to improve air 
force accounting 
charles bowsher comptroller general and head of the general 
accounting office has been worried that the governments 
accounting systems are out of date he chose to examine the air 
force system on the grounds that it is the best in the defense 
department the gao source said 
the report had been planned for transmittal to the senate 
government operations committee chaired by sen john glenn 
dohio on march 1

starting may 1 exxon will resume its 
cleanup of oil remaining in prince william sound and the gulf of 
alaska from the nations largest oil spill company officials said 
wednesday 
exxon suspended its cleanup in september because of the onset of 
severe winter weather but had declined to set a date for further 
work 
we know now that some additional work is going to be needed 
spokesman joe tucker said additional cleanup as required will 
begin around may 1 weather permitting 
exxon officials said survey teams found oil at a depth of 28 
inches in one site but at most problem areas the depth was about 4 
to 6 inches said hann jahns an exxon scientist 
the company found serious problems along about 10 of the 90 
miles of shoreline its crews surveyed jahns said 
the extent of the remaining work will not be determined until 
april tucker said but he predicted the 1990 cleanup would be 
substantially smaller than efforts carried out last year 
the tanker exxon valdez ran aground march 24 on bligh reef south 
of valdez spewing nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude 
hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline were covered with oil and 
countless birds and sea mammals died 
following a meeting of 70 oilspill officials in anchorage on 
tuesday coast guard rear adm david ciancaglini announced that 
exxon would resume the cleanup 
ciancaglini said exxon was not ordered to return exxon will 
return because they are needed to do so he said 
exxon federal and state officials have agreed on a basic 
schedule for the spring cleanup tucker said the company will 
submit a general cleanup plan to ciancaglini by march 15 
ciancaglini the federal onscene coordinator for the cleanup 
said he will have to approve exxons plan before it is put into 
effect 
exxon the coast guard and state and federal agencies will 
develop the best strategy and decide on the appropriate methods to 
remove the remaining oil ciancaglini said 
the agencies and exxon have been working for weeks to assess how 
much oil has been removed by waves rain and other natural 
processes though they disagree on the exact amounts all say 
winter has had a major cleansing effect on the sound but they say 
some of the more protected areas are still in trouble 
ciancaglini said survey crews from exxon the state department 
of environmental conservation and other agencies would spend most 
of april surveying the shores they will meet in late april to 
develop cleanup strategies 
he praised exxons cooperation in assessing the cleanup needs 
with state and federal officials but he said he would not hesitate 
to order a federal takeover of the cleanup if exxon refused to 
carry out the work

when sybron corp negotiated a joint venture in budapest talks 
stalled while attorneys for the hungarian partners grappled to 
translate profit 
it was difficult to put the word profit in the contract in 
hungarian so we wrote it in german said donald rackl chief 
financial officer for the milwaukee manufacturer 
sybron weathered that and other problems starting its first 
business in eastern europe the company expects to dance around 
bigger business potholes when its microscopeslide plant starts 
production this year 
even a veteran like pepsico inc after years of operating in 
the region has altered the way it does business to cope with 
problems alien to the west 
pepsi plants in czechoslovakia sometimes run out of bottles due 
to late shipments in the ukraine state officials waylay delivery 
trucks to haul harvested wheat said richard norton pepsico vice 
president for eastern europe 
such inconveniences are a way of life in countries still shaking 
off the dust of communist rule less easily overcome are structural 
and economic problems rapid inflation huge foreign debt and 
inconvertible currencies that make it difficult to turn profits 
into dollars 
in many respects the revolution in eastern europe remains only 
a promise several countries have no laws on foreign ownership and 
joint ventures they lack legal systems and courts leaving western 
businesses vulnerable if for example suppliers dont deliver and 
customers dont pay 
yet for all the problems eastern europe may represent the 
greatest commercial and financial opportunity since the rebuilding 
of western europe after world war ii the regions 136 million 
consumers crave everything from french fries to shoe polish 
telephones to computer disks 
for companies with global aspirations and patience for profits 
eastern europe is a pot of gold said marvin zonis a 
university of chicago business professor there are real 
possibilities out there and they ought to be pursued 
the commerce departments own analysts say firms dealing in 
agriculture health care telecommunications energy tourism and 
housing may have the best chance of gaining entry and prospering in 
east european markets 
there are plenty of reasons for american companies to invest 
cheap labor is one of the biggest the average hourly manufacturing 
wage in hungary poland and yugoslavia in 1988 was 135 to 171 
said planecon inc a washington research concern specializing in 
eastern europe 
wages could even fall in dollar terms because of an expected 
decline in exchange rates 
moreover east european workers are relatively welleducated and 
highly trained compared with third world counterparts low 
productivity may be a concern but some economists say that can be 
corrected 
workers get lazy and depressed when they get stuck with guys 
who are doing a bad job of running things said edward yardeni 
chief economist at prudentialbache securities inc 
perhaps the biggest incentive for us corporations is global 
competition american giants like general electric international 
business machines and general motors are already there but so are 
rivals suzuki siemens west germanys giant electronics company 
ferruzzi finanziara italys leading chemical and agribusiness 
company and british telecom others are on the way 
eugene theroux an attorney in the washington office of the 
international law firm baker amp mckenzie said its a mistake for 
american businesses to sit back and watch 
they should make at least a minimum of time effort and 
expense necessary to examine the alternatives said theroux who 
advises companies doing business in communist countries 
many companies are doing just that the commerce department and 
chamber of commerce say theyre getting 10 times as many inquiries 
as last year from american companies on everything from 
investment laws to opportunities and licensing commerce secretary 
robert a mosbacher opened an information office on eastern europe 
in january to handle all the calls 
lawyers travel agents and public relations firms are leading 
the way establishing offices and advertising for western clients 
cautious optimism has been replaced by opportunism said 
richard w edelman president of new yorkbased edelman public 
relations worldwide which has opened offices in hungary and is 
scouting elsewhere 
but american executives already experienced in eastern europe 
warn newcomers to calculate the risks many early joint ventures in 
the soviet union failed for lack of careful business plans those 
who decide to go should be prepared to stay awhile 
this is an investment that will have longterm rewards instead 
of a shortterm immediate impact said andrew b somers jr 
general counsel for american express corp which has offices in 
several east european countries this is not something you dabble 
in 
companies in the vanguard also must be prepared to sacrifice 
time and resources to gain a foothold as mcdonalds discovered 
opening its first restaurant in moscow 
the opening took mcdonalds 14 years 50 million and its own 
supply system that bypasses the deadly soviet bureacracy 
while the soviet union is considered more treacherous for 
enterprising westerners economists say eastern europe is similar 
right now if i were an american company i would think the 
prospects were very risky given the political and economic 
transition said georgetown university professor stewart brown 
congress has authorized 300 million in aid for private 
enterprise in poland and hungary the federal exportimport bank 
will guarantee loans up to 200 million to hungary and yugoslavia 
but us companies will have to rely largely on their own 
resources to establish outposts in eastern europe 
anyone not prepared to suffer losses should not go in brown

opening a hotel is never easy but launching the 
first westernmanaged hotel in poland taxed the creativity of 
veteran marriott corp executives 
reaching a jointventure agreement for the warsaw marriott was 
just the start next was the problem of furnishing and equipping 
the 41story 520room hotel built in the shell of a dormant 
warsaw skyscraper 
just about everything was imported said marriott spokesman 
gordon lambourne 
then there was the matter of finding local employees with the 
proper attitude 
the sense of hospitality the sense of private enterprise 
doesnt exist said william r tiefel president of marriotts 
hotels division theres not much incentive to be very creative 
in a job 
the most difficult task was securing a reliable supply of food 
and drink for the hotels 11 restaurants and bars you dont shop 
for prime rib and fine wine in a country where shoppers queue for 
bread and potatoes 
marriotts problems reflect the difficulties inherent in 
cultivating capitalism in old staterun economies its not a 
matter of adding a little water and fertilizer you have to plant 
the very seeds 
marriott took the challenge literally it signed contracts with 
polish farmers fishermen and a brewery to ensure a moreorless 
steady stream of local provisions ranging from beer to lettuce 
it even imported the seed used by the farmers so the produce 
would be up to its standards 
in addition marriott built a freezing and canning plant to 
ensure a yearround supply along with huge food lockers and 
storage areas to hold a months worth of goods much of it imported 
the hotel opened in october and the company is pleased enough 
that its considering outposts in other major east bloc cities 
including budapest prague and moscow 
marriott is no stranger to opening hotels in nonwestern 
countries it had to negotiate similar food procurement contracts 
in the middle east and barbados tiefel said 
but the warsaw hotel posed the most difficult problems the 
company ever faced he said 
the idea for the hotel the first uspolish joint venture 
since the end of american economic sanctions against poland in 
1987 began four years ago when marriott was contacted by partners 
in its vienna hotel tiefel said 
the parters ilbau the austrian construction company that 
built the hotel and girozentrale the bank that financed it 
joined with lot the polish governmentowned airline in proposing 
the warsaw hotel they wanted marriott to run it 
under the joint venture marriott holds an approximate 25 
percent interest in ownership and operation of the hotel and the 
office space that occupies 20 of the buildings floors it also 
gets an undisclosed percentage of profits 
the hotels rooms are rented for foreign currency only and the 
polish government gets a cut the restaurants and bars accept 
zlotys the polish currency which are used to pay most hotel 
expenses 
as for staffing tiefel said there was not a work force to 
draw on that had experience in the lodging business so the 
criteria changed the bigger the smile the quicker we hired 
them he said 
marriott brought in 25 managers to school the staff in 
addition it trained 22 polish workers in the united states and 
brought in several dozen housekeepers bartenders and other 
employees from its western hotels to work alongside their polish 
counterparts tiefel said 
samir daqqaq the hotels marketing director said western 
managers in poland need a very deep well of patience you dont 
train just once it is an ongoing process 
the employees are given two meals daily partly to reduce food 
theft in addition to wages slightly above what they would get 
elsewhere in poland the pay is adjusted monthly for the nations 
runaway inflation marriott said but perhaps the most prized perks 
are the hotel uniforms 
one bellman we have these really nice bellmans uniforms 
he postponed his wedding so he could wear it on his wedding day 
lambourne said

more than a week after it was 
discovered the body of a 15ton whale that washed ashore still lay 
on the beach while officials decided which province would remove it 
the whale washed ashore about nine days ago at elomeid about 55 
miles west of this mediterranean city but had not been removed by 
tuesday because officials in alexandria claimed the halfburied 
carcass was not in their province but in that of mersa matruh 
mersa matruh is unequipped to deal with the body of such a large 
animal which rarely appears in egypts mediterranean waters the 
last time a dead whale was washed ashore in egypt was in 1936 said 
sherif ramadan at the oceanography institute 
an official at alexandrias fire department said that if mersa 
matruh asked for help it would send firefighters with cranes along 
with butchers to cut up the whales body which was so 
disintegrated it could not be lifted whole

when wj usery entered the bitter 
pittston coal strike he was called a supermediator a term that 
seems particularly appropriate with both labor and management 
praising the agreement he helped to forge 
ive seen so much malice and hate across the table usery 
said but if they really listen to each other they find theyre 
not quite as far apart as they thought some people say you just 
wear em down but i dont think thats all true 
maybe so but the former labor secretary readily concedes using 
marathon bargaining sessions in his effort to bring parties to 
agreement 
those whove worked with usery in various negotiations say he 
sets an unrelenting sometimes roundtheclock pace at the 
bargaining table in the pittston talks usery kept negotiators at 
the table for 96 hours straight in a failed bid to reach an accord 
by christmas 
he nearly succeeded the agreement approved by miners monday had 
been reached new years eve 
when youre on a ninemonth strike sometimes theres a 
tendency to say whats another day whats another week usery 
said cautioning that if you recess for a few days then you have 
to start all over again when you get back 
when usery was tapped by labor secretary elizabeth dole to 
intervene in the pittston strike in late october he hesitated at 
first to enter the fray because of the acrimony between the two 
sides 
at that point management and labor hadnt bargained directly 
with one another since the walkout began in april instead they 
were sending messages back and forth through a federal mediator 
usery was at the aflcios winter meeting in bal harbour fla 
when the united mine workers announced tuesday that pittston 
workers had ratified the contract and would soon be back to work 
it was a very difficult time i confess i pushed very hard 
long hours i think today its worth it usery told miners in 
castlewood va on a conference call as the results of the vote 
were announced 
for his efforts the labor department will pay his firm 250 an 
hour for days in which he worked less than six hours and 2750 for 
days in which he worked more expenses will be paid separately 
usery has not submitted a bill 
part of his success usery said in an interview lies in his 
ability to persuade negotiators to set emotions aside and listen to 
their counterparts 
people in a strike sometimes just think about themselves but 
its not just as in this case the miners and their families who 
are losing money management loses all the general stores the 
schools tax base the churches dont get the same offerings 
said the 66yearold usery 
he said that the contract approval represented a huge victory 
for organized labor and that it showed that two sides no matter 
how far apart they are in the bargaining process can ultimately 
find a resolution 
jim kennedy of the railway labor executive association said 
usery has won acclaim for bringing two sides together when it 
appears they are locked into their positions and nothing can 
dynamite them out 
ive seen him push and cajole and bully and charm hell use 
any technique kennedy said 
longtime aide herb fishgold says userys own success story 
rising from being a shipyard welder to president fords labor 
secretary helps explain his mediating style which often appeals 
to negotiators patriotism 
he tries to pay back the country by promoting it fishgold 
said ive watched people at these things and you can just tell 
theyre thinking here we go another speech about mom and apple 
pie but when its all over theyre saying how did he do 
that 
usery himself says 
ive been accused of waving the flag of using the flag but 
the world is so different now theres a global economy 
international concerns we cant afford the luxury of long 
lenthy disputes 
bob healey who was president of the chicago teachers union when 
usery helped settle a threeweek strike there in 1983 
goodnaturedly divulged that usery sometimes would disappear for 
three or four hours during negotiations we thought he was in 
trying to sell it to the school board but we learned later he 
sneaks up and takes naps while nobodys looking 
usery grew up in hardwick ga and began his working career as 
a shipyard welder in world war ii before joining the navy and 
serving in the pacific after his discharge he worked for the 
armstrong cork co where he helped organize a machinists union 
local 
former president nixon brought usery to washington in 1969 as an 
assistant secretary of labor usery immediately won praise for 
helping resolve complicated railroad and airline disputes without 
congress having to step in 
he was named director of the federal mediation and conciliation 
service in 1973 in 1976 ford appointed him secretary of labor 
since going into private business usery has helped mediate 
disputes involving chicago public school teachers the united auto 
workers and general motors and toyota and pro football players

great britains prince charles told 
business leaders from around the globe tuesday that the world needs 
a new deal where capitalism takes on a more humane face 
the crucial factor is whether such an approach can be 
commercial and yet surely it must be good business in the long 
run the prince of wales told about 100 corporate executives 
gathered for an international business conference 
the prince arrived in charleston around noon and was warmly 
cheered by a crowd of about 200 people as he entered the old 
exchange building where south carolinians ratified the us 
constitution in 1788 
about 100 chief executive officers and top business officials 
are attending a twoday meeting of business in the community a 
londonbased group founded by the prince which brings corporate 
leaders together to discuss the roles and responsibilities of 
business 
business is at a crossroads charles told the conference 
does it enter new markets like the cowboys of the new frontier or 
does it take a rather more sophisticated approach which leads to 
continued rather than shortterm profit 
he suggested business leaders can neither take a shortterm 
approach in search of quick profits nor leave the larger problems 
of the environment and education only to the government 
there is no better illustration of this than the greatly 
increased concern by consumers about the impact of business 
processes and products upon the environment he said these are 
no longer frontier days when businesses can afford to make 
shortterm decisions 
the prince who will be in charleston through wednesday is 
making his second visit to the city once known as charles towne he 
last visited in 1977 
during a lunch with the business leaders the prince praised 
mayor joseph p riley jr for the mayors efforts to build the 
antebellum tourist city into an international asset 
charleston has ridden out disaster and setbacks over many 
years not just the terrifying recent effects and loss caused by 
hurricane hugo he said referring to the sept 21 storm that 
left 29 dead and 59 billion in damage in south carolina 
riley said the princes visit would focus attention on the fact 
that charleston has bounced back after the hurricane 
tuesday night the prince and about 400 people attended a 
blacktie gala to benefit hurricane victims 
about 100 people looked on as business leaders and a whos who 
of charleston society entered the brightly lit hibernian hall for 
an evening of dancing 
guests were asked to donate 100 each to the hurricane relief 
effort 
the prince is expected to attend several more conference 
sessions wednesday and visit a public housing complex he plans to 
leave thursday for washington for a meeting with president bush

development of the first genetically 
engineered trees is an important step toward creation of energy 
plantations on which forests would be grown for fuel researchers 
say 
the trees engineered from a species of poplar were altered to 
make them resistant to a widely used herbicide says bruce e 
haissig of the us forest service laboratory in rhinelander wis 
haissig reported on his work at the annual meeting of the 
american association for the advancement of science on tuesday 
a mutant gene from a species of bacteria called salmonella 
which commonly causes food poisoning was introduced into the 
trees making the trees resistant to glyphosate a herbicide 
marketed as roundup 
growing poplars on plantations has been difficult because the 
young trees can be crowded out and killed by weeds herbicides that 
are used to kill the weeds often kill or damage the poplars 
haissig said 
the genetically engineered trees offer the hope of plantations 
in which a herbicide like roundup can be used to kill the weeds 
without harming the trees haissig said 
that would lower the cost of producing the trees which grow 
rapidly and could be burned to provide energy or converted into 
ethanol to run automobiles he said 
the research has been partly supported by the us department of 
energy haissig said scientists in minnesota are working on the 
feasibility of the energy plantations 
that blows hot and cold depending upon what the price of oil 
is he said 
poplars are now grown as ornamental trees haissig said 
theyre a fast screen he said people grow them until they 
can get conifers behind them 
in addition to their fast growth poplars have another 
characteristic that makes them ideal for genetic engineering they 
can be grown from bits of poplar tissue in laboratory culture 
dishes 
when haissig and colleagues at the university of wisconsin and 
calgene in davis calif inserted the salmonella gene into the 
poplars the trees produced an enzyme that allowed them to survive 
after being sprayed with roundup 
in the first experiments the genetically altered trees were 
unable to withstand levels of the herbicide used in the field 
we had a scientific success but not a commercial success 
haissig said 
a second round of experiments improved the trees resistance to 
the herbicide he said 
because poplar trees do not flower for 15 years the researchers 
have not determined whether the herbicide resistance will be 
inherited by the trees offspring 
the trees must flower before they can be bred through 
conventional means 
experiments are under way with jack pine which flowers in two 
years to see whether genetically engineered herbicide resistance 
is permanent 
the genetic engineering of trees is limited because most trees 
cannot be regenerated from tree tissue grown in laboratory dishes 
a necessary step with present methods of genetic engineering 
the most commercially important species are the most difficult 
to regenerate haissig said 
that might be overcome however with a new technique in which a 
gun is used to fire genecarrying microscopic particles into plant 
cells he said

model marla maples fighting back after a week 
of portrayals as the trump tower homewrecker hired a lawyer 
tuesday to stop the media from splashing her face and figure across 
the front page and the tv screen 
were retaining counsel said her publicist chuck jones 
we plan an active pursuit of litigation against people wrongfully 
selling photos and videotape or making libelous statements against 
marla 
jones did not say specifically who might be targeted in the 
models fightback campaign 
meanwhile a newspaper reported that donald trump had ordered 
all pictures of his wife ivana removed from their florida estate 
and that the operation took two days a trump spokesman denied the 
report 
miss maples who has not surfaced publicly since the trump 
divorce story began last week has been featured in frontpage 
tabloid photos and in home video on television programs jones 
asserted some of this material was used without his clients 
approval 
these people are making money off marlas misfortune said 
jones its going to stop 
the trumps announced last week they were separating after nearly 
13 years of marriage despite repeated denials miss maples has 
been prominently mentioned as the other woman who lured trump 
from his wife 
trump defended miss maples in an interview with the new york 
post 
marla is an unfortunate victim of all this she is really a 
very nice person who is really a friend said trump who spent 
the weekend with his wife and their three children at the couples 
florida mansion 
while stories about the couples split continued to make the 
front page neither side appeared any closer to filing divorce 
papers trump again mentioned the possibility of a reconciliation 
to the daily news 
i dont know what will happen well have to see i 
havent discussed it with her but i suppose anything is 
possible trump said 
mrs trump was in her office at the plaza hotel on tuesday said 
her spokesman john scanlon she goes to work every day just like 
the rest of us he said 
shes ok shes a strong woman but shes obviously pained 
said scanlon 
while miss maples was hiring an attorney mrs trump was 
attacking one her attorney michael kennedy said his client felt 
threatened by a report in mondays new york post that trump 
attorney jay goldberg said im a killer i can rip skin off a 
body 
mrs trump has instructed my firm and other colleagues 
representing her and her children to have no further negotiations 
nor anything else to do with you kennedy said in a letter to 
goldberg 
this is an instruction we will scrupulously follow 
goldberg responded with a letter stating he would have no 
further contact with kennedy he also wrote at no time and to 
no one have i ever said that the reason i was retained was to 
inflict any harm physical or otherwise on your client both 
letters were released to the media 
the letters further confuse whether there will be a settlement 
between the trumps who have a prenuptial agreement which would 
reportedly give mrs trump 25 million a connecticut estate and 
custody of their three children 
goldberg and partner stanford lotwin represent trump in the case 
new york post gossip columnist cindy adams to whom goldberg 
made the killer comment called the associated press to further 
clarify the statement 
at no point did goldberg say he was going to rip the skin off 
ivana the thought of taking the flesh off this beautiful 
lovely blonde is absolutely not what this man said to me ms 
adams said 
during his florida visit the palm beach post reported tuesday 
trump ordered that all pictures of mrs trump be removed from the 
estate named maralago 
it took them two days an unidentified palm beach socialite 
told the newspaper 
trump the paper reported had been planning to stay at 
maralago with a friend this weekend but mrs trump decided to 
come to the mansion with the couples three children donald jr 
12 ivancka 8 and eric 6 
a spokesman for trump howard rubenstein denied the report 
about the pictures and denied that trump had planned to spend the 
weekend with a friend 
mrs trump and the children arrived friday night trump joined 
his family sunday and left monday after a wonderful trip the 
spokesman said 
one socialite who knows the trumps told the palm beach post that 
about 25 guests attended a birthday celebration for mrs trump at 
which the trump children sang tunes including ivancka crooning 
edelweiss

an opposition coalition glued together 
from an atomized fractious array of parties is posing the 
strongest challenge to the sandinistas rule since they took power 
more than a decade ago 
the united national opposition called uno now consists of 14 
parties or party factions all backing opposition newspaper 
publisher violeta barrios de chamorro a living symbol of the fight 
for democracy 
uno is spanish for one but the nicaraguan political tradition 
of uniting in the face of a common enemy seldom lasts long after 
defeat or victory 
president daniel ortega seeking reelection has tried to drive 
a wedge into the opposition coalition by mocking the wide variety 
of parties comprising uno they range from the communist party to 
ideological opposites in the conservative party 
this is such a mishmash it can give you indigestion 
ortega told delighted supporters at one rally let president 
bush eat it 
can uno hold together and govern through 1996 should it win 
sundays general elections 
yes we have matured alfredo cesar an adviser to mrs 
chamorro said in an interview 
he said one reason is we have a unanimously agreedto 
government program 
dona violeta is the second reason everyone in the coalition 
trusts she will comply with her commitment and put the program into 
place 
at least for now everyone has something to gain by sticking 
together and everything to lose if they let mutual suspicions drive 
them apart 
but when the hopedfor spoils were being divided at least one 
party was not happy 
the secretarygeneral of peoples social christian party stayed 
within uno while its president joined a social christian alliance 
running separately 
the official reason was irreconcilable differences the widely 
believed rumor was that the party president mauricio diaz did not 
think his party had been granted enough candidates for the 90 
national assembly seats at stake 
nicaraguas political cast is full of splinter parties besides 
ortega and mrs chamorro there are eight other presidential 
candidates 
unos vicepresidential candidate virgilio godoy of the 
independent liberal party has been criticized within the coalition 
as arrogant and abrasive 
the power struggle wont be settled by the voters because each 
party will be able to claim it was a major drawing card for mrs 
chamorros ticket 
nicaraguas past doesnt offer much of a model for stability 
said jorge eduardo arellano a history professor 
theres no history here theres only a caricature arellano 
said despite the idea of the liberals and conservatives 
traditionally dominating nicaraguan politics up to 10 factions 
existed at the turn of the century six in the 1940s he said 
the somozas who ran nicaragua from the time of the death of 
augusto cesar sandino in 1934 until they were toppled by sandinos 
heirs in 1979 were able to use the internal dynamics of coalitions 
to divide and rule 
the sandinistas themselves have displayed a party discipline 
that has proven their biggest strength 
thats the really amazing thing that the nine comandantes 
top party leaders have hung together for 10 years a western 
diplomat said 
nevertheless during their years as a guerrilla group the 
sandinistas split into three factions 
one advocated a prolonged guerrilla war another favored 
educating the masses on marxist theory and slowly building up urban 
discontent the third was intent on seizing the first opportunity 
to push a mass insurrection 
the third faction was able to forge tactical alliances with 
angry nicaraguans of all social classes to knock down somoza in 
july 1979 
despite that the sandinistas united to rule although there 
have been rumored disagreements notably over ending a ceasefire 
last november with the usbacked contra rebels 
the assassination of mrs chamorros husband pedro joaquin 
chamorro was the spark that lit the sandinista revolution and the 
winners initially forged a junta that included nonsandinistas 
including mrs chamorro 
the nonsandinistas didnt last long though 
since then the sandinistas have faced several opposition 
coalitions including the democratic coordinating board which 
eventually dropped out of the 1984 elections 
this time despite internal bickering fraying at the edges and 
gaping differences in background and thinking the main opposition 
coalition has managed to hang together at least through the 
campaign

smokers on smokefree airliners would be 
welladvised to do breathing exercises doodle or take a nap say 
groups who pushed for the 99 percent ban that takes effect sunday 
the american heart and lung associations and the american cancer 
society said tuesday they are offering free advice to air travelers 
who will have to do without cigarettes on all but about 28 of the 
17000 daily domestic flights 
only flights of more than six hours to alaska or hawaii will 
have smoking sections beginning sunday 
a walletsized tip card printed by the coalition on smoking or 
health advises smokers to take along lowcalorie snacks and to 
focus on positive thoughts of clean air and a clear head 
it suggests hold your breath while you count to four and 
exhale slowly letting out all the air from your lungs slowly 
repeat these steps five times 
it also offers doodling or doing crossword puzzles as a means of 
keeping fingertips busy and proposes as a last resort lean back 
and sleep 
the coalition unveiled its campaign to help smokers cope at a 
news conference with congressional sponsors of the new law and the 
association of flight attendants which pushed for the change 
chronic lung inflammation respiratory and sinus problems 
dizziness nausea and severe headaches will no longer plague our 
members their colleagues or the passengers who share their 
environment said juliette d lenoir representing flight 
attendants 
increased cancer risk estimated in a transportation department 
study released last week also would be eliminated ms lenoir said 
rep dick durbin dill said he would move to ban smoking on 
trains and buses he said although a majority of amtrak passengers 
say they like the railroads rules separating smoking passengers by 
car some complain that they have to pass through the smoking areas 
on their way to the dining car 
sen frank lautenberg dnj said the smoking ban should be an 
incentive for smokers to kick the habit 
i think smoking ought to be done in the privacy of ones home 
or ones business where it doesnt affect others he said 
lautenberg and durbin issued a summary of the government study 
which concluded that cigarette smoke in airline cabins could kill 
between 12 and 15 cabin crew members out of every 100000 over the 
next 20 years assuming they fly about 960 hours a year 
frequent fliers also would be exposed to an increased risk if 
smoking had continued said the study which was commissioned 
before the smoking ban on airliners

last year the smithsonian institution acquired 
an old pullman railroad car spittoon ray bolgers scarecrow 
costume from the wizard of oz a giant pacific octopus 14 
condom vending machines with 108 condoms 50 parking meters and 
1272 drymounted specimens of lice 
these and more than 700000 other objects joined the vast 
collections of the smithsonian a sort of large national cigar box 
where americans stuff their odds and ends mostly odd 
also carted into the smithsonians complex of museums and art 
galleries in 1989 were a sculpture made of grapevine roots an air 
force c130a hercules cargo plane a satin chinese hanging scroll 
from the ming dynasty and several thousand worlds fair souvenirs 
dating to 1850 
the list includes 75 original paving bricks from the 
indianapolis motor speedway the original propeller nose cone 
removed from charles lindberghs spirit of st louis airplane 
because of a crack and 2500 fossils containing imprints of ferns 
crabs and trilobites which lived in a northern illinois swamp more 
than 300 million years ago 
officials said the smithsonians holdings grew to nearly 138 
million objects with last years acquisitions many of which came 
from private collectors like clifford krainik of alexandria va 
whose passion was ballooning 
the national air and space museum bought krainiks 400item 
collection of balloon memorabilia including matthew brady 
photographs of civil war balloons a balloonshaped perfume bottle 
and valentines greeting cards handbills and sheet music about 
balloons 
the biggest recipient was the national museum of natural 
history its 674817 new items included a pair of stuffed passenger 
pigeons from colorado a flying lizard from the philippines a 
footballsized brazilian quartz crystal containing golden needles 
8152 mounted specimens of wasps 30 garments and household objects 
used by tibetan nomads and a piece of petrified timber from cyprus 
that has turned into copper 
only a tiny fraction of the smithsonians vast collections are 
on display at its 14 museums and galleries in washington and new 
york plus the national zoo the bulk of its nearly 138 million 
objects are specimens housed in the natural history museum and used 
for scientific research 
the giant octopus by the way was captured off the coast of

the city council voted unanimously tuesday to 
take all possible steps to stop aerial pesticide spraying against 
the medfly heating up the dispute between rural and urban areas 
over how to fight the cropkilling insect 
disagreeing with official assurances the spraying is safe the 
council approved a motion to pursue lawsuits and administrative 
appeals to force the state to halt spraying and to study the 
potential risks of malathion 
this is going to be a tough case but its a case we have to 
fight said councilman joel wachs the public has a right and a 
demand to know if the goverment is leveling with them 
the council also voted 150 to look into blocking the movement 
of all produce through los angeles airport and harbor facilities 
until farm officials agree to discuss with the city the use of 
malathion 
councilwoman gloria molina said state officials have failed to 
look seriously at the possible risks of spraying because of 
pressure from the powerful agricultural industry 
the state is spraying 400 square miles of los angeles and orange 
counties at night to wipe out the worst infestation of the 
cropdestroying bug since 198182 helicopters drop a mixture of 
malathion and sticky corn syrup bait 
agriculture officials contend the spraying poses no health risks 
and is a necessary step to avert an estimated 200 million in crop 
losses a year if the medfly becomes established in the state 
the mediterranean fruit fly lays its eggs in more than 250 
varieties of fruits vegetables and nuts grown in california the 
crops are destroyed when the larvae hatch and eat their way out 
councilman michael woo called the spraying a blatant example 
of the urban population of this state being held hostage to the 
agricultural industry 
california farm bureau spokesman clark biggs said farmers 
sympathize with southern californians for having to live with the 
spraying but contended that wiping out the medfly is in everyones 
best interest 
its no fun to have helicopters flying over your house in the

president bush is nibbling at the edges of a 
major constitutional confrontation with congress and so far 
democratic leaders are not calling his hand on it 
in a calculated act of civil disobedience bush has told 
congress he wont carry out certain provisions of certain laws 
because he believes them to be an infringement on his 
constitutional powers 
its a new twist on the old argument over lineitem veto powers 
long sought unsuccessfully by republican presidents from 
democratic congresses 
bushs first act of defiance came little noticed last november 
on a bill providing money for two federal agencies he did it again 
last friday on a 98 billion state department measure 
so far the presidents actions have generated little heat in 
congress largely because he asnt done much to publicize them 
and consequently members generally seem unaware of what hes been 
up to 
were going to put someone on this right away said rep don 
edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on 
civil and constitutional rights 
edwards who usually keeps track of such things said he had not 
been aware of bushs assertions its totally unacceptable to 
have a president who doesnt comply with the law he said 
in november bush signed a bill providing funds for the treasury 
department and the postal service but said he would refuse to obey 
one section 
the section would have prevented him from requiring government 
employes to sign statements promising not to disclose classified 
information bush said the provision interfered with his 
constitutional duty to protect such information and that he 
wasnt going to obey it 
on friday bush signed a bill authorizing 98 billion for the 
state department for the next two years but said he would not go 
along with several key sections 
bush said he would refuse to obey a requirement that the 
administration report to congress future sensitive diplomatic 
missions like national security adviser brent scowcrofts 
clandestine trip last june to beijing 
furthermore he said he would disobey requirements that he 
disclose any us contacts with palestine liberation organization 
members who might be terrorists and that he include members of 
congress in the us delegation negotiating arms reductions in 
europe 
in each instance bush cited interference with what he asserted 
was his constitutional right to conduct foreign policy 
bushs initiatives were applauded by mitch daniels who was 
white house political director for former president reagan and who 
now is director of the hudson institute a think tank in 
indianapolis 
i think its an important step by bush to reclaim the rightful 
presidential prerogative this has really gotten to the ridiculous 
stage where massive authorization bills not only attempt to hogtie 
the administration but sometimes even with language that no one 
really voted for daniels said 
i like the style hes done it quietly he said 
since the supreme court and not the executive branch has the 
final say on whats constitutional bushs strategy seems destined 
to end up in a court challenge 
still bush has long been concerned over what he views as 
the erosion of the executives constitutional powers by congress 
and he feels as president he has the constitutional duty to 
refuse to obey laws that he thinks jeopardize his constitutional 
powers said deputy white house spokesman alixe glen 
bushs actions do not constitute a lineitem veto as such but 
have some of the same impact a lineitem veto is the ability to 
veto specific lines or sections of a spending bill while leaving 
the rest standing a power enjoyed by 43 governors but not by the 
president 
most legal scholars although significantly not white house 
lawyers claim lineitem veto powers require an amendment to the 
constitution 
some conservatives including white house counsel c boyden 
gray claim that the president may already have such powers 
congressional democrats have said theyll sue the president if he 
attempts to exert them 
gray is searching for a test case on which to try to exercise 
lineitem veto powers aides said

at least one federal agency is among the ranks 
of deadbeats who dont pay their taxes on time adding as much as 
250 million to the total of taxes owed but not turned over to the 
internal revenue service 
in fact irs officials hint that several federal agencies 
delayed handing over withheld taxes at one time or another 
prompting rep byron l dorgan dnd to complain such actions 
carry the definition of a tax deadbeat to a new low 
if the irs cant make a federal agency own up to its tax 
responsibility who can they influence dorgan said tuesday after 
a hearing by the house ways and means oversight subcommittee on 
taxes owed but not collected the total of those 13 million 
accounts receivable is rising by 11 million a day to as high as 
87 billion 
dorgan said members of the subcommittee have information that 
one federal agency was late in turning over more than 250 million 
it had withheld from workers paychecks 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr acknowledged only that one 
agency which he would not identify because of privacy laws was 
once listed among taxpayers with a delinquency of 100 million or 
more 
however senior deputy commissioner michael j murphy said that 
when he served as director of the philadelphia district office 
we did have problems with some federal agencies 
when dorgan said there is evidence that two major federal 
agencies routinely delay making tax payments perhaps to avoid a 
temporary budget crunch charly brennan deputy commissioner for 
operations said we will give you a report on it 
goldberg said that although the agency can impose stiff 
penalties on employers that are late in making tax payments there 
is no authority to penalize government agencies for the same 
shortcoming 
goldberg and jennie stathis a director of the general 
accounting office agreed that as little as 30 billion of the 
gross 87 billion total of accounts receivable may be collectible 
it is going to be tens of billions of dollars goldberg 
said whether its 30 billion or 40 billion its a lot of 
money he said the irs has to abandon efforts to collect up to 3 
billion each year because of a sixyear statute of limitations 
goldberg acknowledged the irs has no way of knowing how much can 
be collected or even why the delinquency figure continues to grow 
he said the irs will be able to cut into accounts receivable if 
congress approves the 50 million that president bush asked to add 
1000 personnel to the agencys 20000employee collection division 
next year he noted the irs has under way a longterm plan to 
modernize its computer systems 
goldberg and robert m tobias president of the national 
treasury employees union which represents most irs employees 
criticized the uponeyear downthenext spending for irs workers 
goldberg said about 25 billion of the 87 billion accounts 
receivable is considered currently not collectible and unlikely to 
be collected in the future an account is given this label when 
for example a corporation goes out of business or the irs 
determines an individual is unable to pay 
the remaining 62 billion involves about 13 million accounts 
receivable including 3300 that total more than 14 billion 
goldberg said 17 accounts totaling 54 billion involve at least 
100 million each much of the total is not collectible because it 
is bloated by duplications and by errors by the irs and taxpayers 
goldberg defended the irss record between 1984 and 1989 we 
collected over 5 trillion in revenue he noted our current 
accounts receivable inventory is less than 2 percent of that 
amount and we will ultimately collect most of what is due

sidewalk of bucharests main street waiting in line not for some 
rarely seen delicacy but for copies of a previously banned book

stanescu whose acid cartoons had belittled the golden epoch of 
ousted and executed communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
the dictator banned stanescus books

snaked toward the dalles gallery where stanescu was signing copies 
of the book now is not the moment and a poster showing how 
romania had rejoined europe after the december revolution which

mihai stanescu is the only one who told the truth and he was 
not afraid said another man speaking on condition of anonymity

signing his name about 5000 times said his popularity helped 
keep him from arrest under ceausescu 
he said that with his favorite targets gone he now was eying 
romanias interim government and more than 40 political parties 
but so far he hasnt found much humor in them 
before when the regime was evil my work was motivated by 
hate he said today i must base myself solely on humor it 
can be more difficult 
while sipping passion fruit tea from an i love london mug in 
his studio he said he was very optimistic about romanias 
return to democracy 
i say this despite the fact that the romanian people are not 
politically mature he said i think the front is sincere and 
we are on our way to pluralistic democracy he added referring 
to the national salvation front

now shares power with 37 other parties in the provisional council 
of national unity

house speaker thomas s foley says an income 
tax credit could be good way to help workers offset some of their 
social security payroll taxes 
foley told reporters tuesday that the idea one of several top 
democrats are studying to deal with the giant social security trust 
fund surplus is a very interesting proposal 
it would i think tend to restore some progressivity to the tax 
system and it has other features i think are worthy of very 
serious consideration said foley dwash 
leading house and senate democrats are looking for ways to 
address questions that have been raised about the social security 
payroll tax and the surplus it has raised that some say is 
disguising the true size of the overall federal deficit one option 
under study would let workers take a credit on their income tax 
return for a portion of the payroll tax they pay 
led by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny critics have said 
the social security levy discriminates against low and 
middleincome people moynihan has proposed legislation slashing 
the payroll tax rate 
workers pay a 765 percent social security payroll tax an 
amount that is in addition to their income tax employers must also 
pay the government an equal amount on behalf of each employee 
the tax is levied only on the first 51300 of annual earnings 
people pay no payroll tax on their wages above that amount and pay 
no payroll tax on income from interest dividends rents and other 
nonwage earnings as a result wealthier people pay 
proportionately smaller payroll taxes than lowerincome people 
sources speaking on condition they not be identified said 
democratic aides have not decided how large the incometax credit 
would be who would be eligible or when it would begin 
by letting workers recover some of their payroll tax payments by 
claiming income tax credits the plan could blunt bush 
administration charges that democrats want to make changes in the 
social security system 
its one great source of appeal obviously is you dont have to 
do anything about the social security trust fund said one source 
moynihans plan would cut the governments payroll tax 
collections by 62 billion over the next two years a sizeable 
addition to what is already an expected 138 billion budget deficit 
for this year it has been criticized by senate finance committee 
chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas house ways and means committee 
chairman dan rostenkowski dill the american association of 
retired persons and the national association of manufacturers 
but the plan is believed to have the support of many members of 
congress because it would cut taxes 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said 
tuesday there is a large fluid body of senators undecided 
about moynihans bill he predicted there could be a stampede in 
favor of the moynihan proposal should there be a vote on it 
the group studying the social security question hopes to make a 
recommendation as early as this week it consists of bentsen 
rostenkowski sasser senate majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo and house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
this year the social security trust fund is expected to have a 
66 billion surplus

the national federation of federal employees 
says president bush should stand behind his words and embrace the 
flag by making flag day a federal holiday 
in a statement tuesday the union said it has written the 
president who has often expressed his devotion to the american 
flag urging him to give government employees the day off 
flag day is june 14 
although it is printed in the calendar it comes and goes 
every year with little or no recognition said james m peirce 
president of the union 
bush used the flag heavily in his presidential campaign and 
wound up his acceptance speech at the 1988 republican national 
convention by leading delegates in the pledge of allegiance 
he later criticized his democratic opponent massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis for vetoing a bill that would have penalized 
schoolteachers who failed to lead their students in the pledge 
he has also advocated a constitutional amendment to bar 
desecration of the flag in response to a supreme court ruling that 
burning a flag was a protected form of free speech under the first 
amendment 
nffe strongly agrees with the president that americans should 
salute the flag rather than desecrate it the employees union 
said now it is time for president bush to stand behind his words 
and embrace the flag by giving federal workers a day to honor and 
celebrate this great american institution 
there was no immediate comment from the white house where press 
officers were in a meeting 
jane polanksy spokesperson for the federation said the union 
made no endorsement in the presidential campaign

a janitor infected with the aids virus filed a 
lawsuit against a hospital saying he has been going through a 
living death since a contaminated needle in trash he was ordered 
to remove punctured his leg 
the 22yearold guatemalan immigrant filed suit against cedars 
medical center tuesday in dade circuit court after negotiations 
with the hospitals insurance carriers failed to reach an 
acceptable settlement his lawyer said 
cedars negligence has effectively condemned the plaintiff to 
a living and premature death said miami attorney ellis rubin in 
the suit filed on behalf of the young man identified only as jose 
doe 
the suit does not name a monetary figure but rubin said he will 
seek several million dollars 
money can never give me back the rest of my life that has been 
taken away from me doe said tuesday in a statement i can 
never have children and i am going through a living death 
the suit claims the worker was ordered on jan 13 1989 to 
remove garbage and medical waste from a vacant room most recently 
occupied by a patient being treated for human immunodeficency 
virus which causes aids 
the worker hired to clean floors and empty trash from 
storerooms and snack rooms was not told about the condition of the 
patient and was never trained in the proper disposal of 
contaminated medical waste the suit said 
the worker removed the medical waste in a red plastic bag and 
was bumped by someone getting onto an elevator a contaminated 
needle inside the bag jabbed the workers left calf the suit 
alleged 
the live virus was pumped directly into the plaintiffs 
bloodstream the suit said 
the worker was immediately given a blood test which found no 
trace of the aids virus but the suit said a followup test on 
march 7 1989 found he had the aids antibodies 
the suit said the worker had not had sex since late 1987 and is 
not an intravenous drug user or transfusion recipient 
rubin said his client has experienced nightmares and severe 
anxiety attacks since learning he has contracted aids 
the suit claims cedars was negligent for allowing an untrained 
janitor to remove hivcontaminated waste and carry it by elevator 
to the incinerator which violates rules on transportation of 
medical waste 
miles mcgrane an attorney for the hospital was in st louis on 
tuesday and unavailable for comment his secretary said 
doe is still working at the hospital for servicemaster co 
which contracts janitorial services he is the sole financial 
support for his mother two sisters and three brothers rubin said 
this is the most tragic case ive ever had said rubin 
fate god or whatever you want to call it touched jose doe on 
friday the 13th 
since the early 1980s 19 healthcare workers in the united 
states have been infected with the hiv virus from jobrelated 
activities including 12 from needle jabs said charles fallis a 
spokesman with the national centers for disease control in atlanta 
in new york city last month trial began in a 175 million 
lawsuit filed by an aidsinfected doctor who claims she was stuck 
with a contaminated needle when she reached into a pile of gauze 
and bed linens in 1983

the department of transportation says the risk 
of cancer among airline crew members from cosmic radiation is 
nearly 17 times greater than it reported last week 
the dot on tuesday acknowledged an error in a major study 
assessing airliner cabin environment officials said the error 
occurred when a researcher copied figures from the wrong table 
the report originally estimated that cosmic radiation could 
cause from 5 to 61 additional deaths from cancer per 100000 crew 
members flying for 20 years 
the revised figures put this at up to 1000 additional deaths 
per 100000 for crew members who fly long routes about twice a week 
and about 500 deaths per 100000 among passengers who fly long 
routes once a week 
these deaths would be in addition to the expectation that 22000 
out of 100000 about one out of five people will die of cancer 
from all causes 
officials cautioned however that the risk data is not based on 
any study of actual cancer cases but on mathematical models 
projecting the effects of lowlevel cosmic radiation based on what 
is known about higher radiation doses 
bob marx dot spokesman said officials are concerned about the 
radiation risk to airliner crews and the federal aviation 
administration plans to issue a warning document

the house agriculture committee is questioning 
the bush administrations tightmoney budget policy toward 
agriculture while the white house calls for increases in 
controversial weapons systems 
during a hearing tuesday on the 1990 farm bill rep jim jontz 
dind asked agriculture secretary clayton yeutter how much he 
recommended that the office of management and budget allow for 
commodity programs in fiscal 1991 
jontz said that in light of increases in spending requested by 
the administration for the b2 stealth bomber strategic defense 
initiative and foreign aid we ought to do better 
yeutter did not say how much he recommended saying only hed 
asked for more than the 118 billion omb projected for commodity 
program outlays 
we got all we could reasonably expect said yeutter 
before yeutter testified the agriculture committee approved a 
letter to the house budget committee saying it must take 
exception with the budget proposals submitted by president bush 
the unspecified reduction of 15 billion in 1991 commodity 
spending increasing to over 19 billion through 1995 is an 
unreasonably high 13 percent of commodity program outlays said 
the letter from committee chairman kika de la garza and ranking 
republican rep edward madigan rill 
not only is this disproportionate when compared with other 
major programs it threatens disruption of a delicate recovery of 
agricultural financial institutions the letter said 
de la garza told yeutter he thought it was wrong that 
agriculture although only 1 percent of the total federal budget 
was being asked to come up with 18 percent of the cuts needed to 
reduce the deficit in fiscal 1991 
the committee chairman said he was tired of the obsession with 
bashing the farmer over the federal governments program for 
guaranteeing farmers a certain price for particular commodities 
it there is any subsidy its the american consumer being 
subsidized on the backs of the american farmer de la garza said 
defenders of the farm subsidy programs often point out us 
consumers spend a smaller proportion of their disposable income on 
food than consumers in other countries 
the debate over commodity support in the 1990 farm bill which 
sets policy for five years is expected to be heated but congress 
is still in the developmental stage on the legislation 
another heavily debated issue is crop insurance which yeutter 
wants eliminated in favor of permanent disaster aid legislation 
nearly every member at the hearing showed support for improving 
crop insurance rather than eliminating it 
crop insurance as we now have it will not continue said de 
la garza but he said the house will propose an actuarily sound 
system of insurance rather than permanent disaster aid 
congress established the federally subsidized crop insurance 
program in 1980 to insure 50 crops that are vulnerable to drought 
or other natural disaster but farmer participation has been 
largely voluntary during the 1988 and 1989 droughts congress 
provided additional money to cover crop losses that were not 
insured 
yeutter said he didnt have confidence the insurance program 
could be made actuarily sound because participation is so low 
in other areas covered by the farm bill yeutter said 
the american soybean associations graduated equity loan 
program proposal is an expensive proposition which the 
administration does not think the country can afford 
he is not recommending any changes in the sugar program because 
sugar is a multilateral issue we ought to deal with it in the 
uruguay round the international trade talks scheduled to be 
completed by the end of the year 
the farmers home administration needs tightening because it 
has tilted over the last decade or so into a grant agency the 
whole program has gone off on a tangent which is costing the 
taxpayers too much money

the nearly 1700 appalachian miners who 
ratified a contract with pittston coal group after a 10month 
strike prepared to go back to their jobs this week but not 
everyone is happy about it 
in the eastern kentucky coal town of mcandrews any plans to 
celebrate were tempered by the uncertain fate of 13 miners facing 
suspension during the bitter labor dispute 
pittston president michael odom who announced the return to 
work says most of the united mine workers in virginia west 
virginia and kentucky will be back on their jobs by monday the 
first shifts begin thursday night 
were going to go about the business now of mining coal umw 
vice president cecil roberts said tuesday during a news conference 
to announce that the contract replacing an agreement that expired 
in february 1988 was ratified by 6337 percent 
the miners got the job security and health and retirement 
provisions they sought and pittston won the right to operate 
roundtheclock with voluntary labor sunday morning and afternoon 
now the umw leadership must turn its attention to circuit judge 
donald mcglothlin who rejected a request by union and company 
attorneys to drop 64 million in fines against the umw but gave 
them until thursday to try to change his mind 
still on the minds of many was the fate of 13 miners the union 
expects pittston to suspend for alleged misconduct during the 
strike 
members of local 5737 at mcandrews campaigned to defeat the 
contract because it failed to guarantee the miners jobs 
many miners had expected the local to handily defeat the 
contract as a statement of union solidarity for the 13 
afterward some spoke bitterly about the locals rejection of 
the agreement in a 9693 vote 
to me its the end of the union said ann osborne wife of 
a striking miner i still say a man who voted yes on that 
contract is no better than a scab 
jack clevenger jr a retired miner said those who voted for 
the contract were independent people voting for themselves 
the contracts approval probably will cause tension in the 
local and he expected its going to take time to heal it 
the specific allegations against the 13 miners would be detailed 
after contract ratification said glenn stanley the locals 
president the cases then would be turned over to an arbitrator for 
settlement 
the pittston dispute was marred by sporadic violence but 
roberts said we all learned some lessons from this strike its 
better to talk than to fight 
roberts and odom agreed it will take some time for the harsh 
feelings between the union and company to heal but both predicted 
the animosity will be shortlived 
a lot of times two tough kids on the block have a fight and 
become the best of friends afterward odom said 
odom declined to predict how long it would take to get back to 
full production but he noted the union employees were enthusiastic 
as strikers and will be enthusiastic as workers 
everyone seems really happy to go back to work said roger 
caldwell a field representative for the umw in logan wva 
overall its a contract they can live with 
in eastern kentucky residents and business owners in pike 
county were happy the strike was ending 
everybodys just tickled that its over said eva ryan who 
operates a motel in toler near the kentuckywest virginia border 
everybodys for the miners we want them to get what they want 
logan county in west virginia has been the focus of most 
strikerelated violence since about 300 miners walked off the job 
at pittston there 
when the mining industry gets sick logan county gets 
pneumonia said mark spurlock a logan county commissioner 
were overjoyed that its been settled apparently with a 
contract thats well thought of by the miners

hunger is not just an abstract political 
debate it can be a daily battle for poor families a pair of 
mothers on welfare told members of congress 
and its a battle the families dont always win they said 
my children are always asking for food said peggy adams a 
mother of nine from montgomery county md 
you may think thats fairly typical for children and maybe it 
is but half of the time i dont have enough food to feed them 
whenever they are hungry she said 
mary tamper a prince georges county md mother of two told 
a similar story tuesday to members of the senate budget committee 
there were times when my son would say mom i know you just 
fed me but im still hungry she said this hurt me more than 
any knife especially when there was no food in the cupboard 
both testified in the senate committees hearings on hunger and 
the bush administrations proposals for food and nutritional 
funding 
sen jim sasser dtenn chairman of the budget committee said 
the bush administrations budget proposal for fiscal 1991 cuts 462 
million from the child nutrition budget and freezes the food stamp 
program 
it is a budget that goes in the wrong direction as far as 
hungry americans are concerned sasser said 
he said he believed congress will support higher spending for 
nutrition programs for families with children 
dr victor w sidel a social medicine professor at albert 
einstein college of medicine in the bronx ny cited estimates 
that 2 million to 5 million lowincome children in the united 
states are hungry and that the figure could go as high as 9 
million 
he said hungry children suffer twice as many illnesses as other 
children and he charged the nations record on child and prenatal 
nutrition was obscene 
a nation that permits its children to go hungry cannot claim 
moral leadership sidel said 
sen pete domenici rnm ranking republican on the panel 
defended the bush administrations budget proposal saying some 
cuts in eligibility for school lunch assistance may be warranted 
and that food stamp assistance levels were adequate in some cases 
both mrs tamper and mrs adams said the federal women infants 
and children program providing food assistance for pregnant 
mothers and their children up to age 5 filled the gaps after they 
found themselves thrust into poverty 
all i can say is thank god for wic said mrs tamper 
although the assistance is provided for the youngest children 
and their mothers both mothers said they used the wic food to feed 
the whole family 
both described a sudden descent from middle class to welfare and 
poverty after losing their husbands income 
mrs tampers husband died after being diagnosed with leukemia 
she said she was forced to give up her job as a teachers aide for 
a time and that they moved in with her mother while relying on 
social security survivor benefits rent subsidies and other 
assistance 
mrs adams said her family lost its 55000 annual income when 
she and her husband were separated and he was sentenced to prison 
she said her family has benefited from food stamps public 
assistance and wic 
despite the aid she said her 9yearold sons weight has 
dropped from 65 pounds to 60 pounds and her 5yearold son has 
dropped a size in clothing her 8yearold twins havent outgrown 
their clothes in two years 
i have seen my childrens bodies stop growing like they 
should and i pray its not their brains as well mrs adams said

keepers of the doomsday clock say the world is 
moving drastically away from the threat of nuclear war 
for years the doomsday clock on the cover of the bulletin of the 
atomic scientists has been ticking back and forth toward midnight 
an indication of the state of superpower relations 
after standing at six minutes before midnight or the threat of 
nuclear war for two years the bulletins april edition may turn 
the clock back reflecting recent reforms in the soviet union and 
its eastern european allies 
editor len ackland said tuesday that a decision hasnt been made 
on where the clocks hands will be in april 
but nobel laureate leon m lederman director emeritus of the 
fermi national accelerator laboratory outside chicago and one of 
the scientists whose opinions influence the clocks movement said 
i wanted the hands to move back the most the danger of military 
confrontation between the superpowers and the credibility of that 
threat is lessening every hour 
the clock first appeared on the june 1947 bulletin to evoke the 
image of the apocalypse universal conflagration bursting forth at 
the darkest hour and of military attack with the countdown to 
zero hour ackland said 
the clock was closest to midnight two minutes away in 1953 
after the united states successfully tested the hydrogen bomb 
it was farthest from midnight 12 minutes in 1963 after the 
signing of the partial test ban treaty and again in 1972 when the 
strategic arms limitation treaty was signed 
it last moved in 1988 shifting back from three minutes before 
midnight to six minutes away due in large part to the ussoviet 
treaty eliminating intermediaterange nuclear missiles ackland 
said 
the bulletin was founded in 1945 by scientists who worked at the 
university of chicago on the manhattan project the successful 
us effort to build an atomic bomb during world war ii among its 
founders were j robert oppenheimer sometimes called the father of 
the atomic bomb and albert einstein 
the magazine published by the educational foundation for 
nuclear science has 17000 subscribers in 70 countries 
the magazines worldwide board of scientific sponsors debates 
the international climate through letters and over the telephone to 
determine whether the hands of the clock should move 
the sponsors make their recommendations to the bulletins board 
of directors and editors who have the final say 
lederman a member of both boards said he believes that since 
world war ii the world has never been further from nuclear war 
than it is now though he added it will be hard for bureaucrats to 
stop asking for huge military expenditures 
but despite the general view among bulletin sponsors that the 
threat of nuclear war is diminishing some note changes that could 
pose a threat to peace 
they are concerned by the growth of nationalism strident 
nationalism in eastern europe and other places said lederman 
who won the 1988 nobel prize in physics

the rights of endangered children sometimes 
outweigh an adults right against selfincrimination the us 
supreme court ruled in the case of a mother jailed for refusing to 
disclose her sons whereabouts 
the court ruled 72 tuesday that jacqueline bouknight of 
baltimore may continue to be jailed indefinitely for refusing to 
tell authorities where her 3yearold son maurice can be found 
social service workers fear the boy is dead 
the bottom line is the court is following an equation that 
says if we think its important enough individual rights have to 
give way here we think the rights of children the concern for 
children is important enough said mary cheh professor of 
constitutional law at george washington university in washington 
dc 
but a defense attorney said the punishment has not worked and 
announced plans to file a motion in circuit court in baltimore 
seeking the immediate release of bouknight who has been held in a 
city jail since april 1988 
twentytwo months of incarceration has had no effect on ms 
bouknights position it is against the law to keep her there 
there is no reason for the court to reasonably believe that 
continued incarceration would do anything else defense lawyer m 
cristina gutierrez said 
maurice has been missing since september 1987 when he was 11 
months old 
when he was 3 months old maurice was admitted to a baltimore 
hospital for treatment of a broken leg and other injuries he was 
held temporarily in protective care 
he was returned to his mother after she agreed to undergo 
training in parenting skills and said she would not physically 
punish him 
maurices father was shot to death two years ago and his mother 
had a history of drug use according to testimony in juvenile court 
nine months later social workers said bouknight was not 
cooperating with them she was held in contempt by a judge after 
she refused to disclose maurices whereabouts 
the maryland court of appeals the states highest court ruled 
dec 19 that jailing bouknight for refusing to disclose the 
information violated her constitutional protection against 
selfincrimination that ruling was overturned tuesday 
societys interest in protecting the boy from harm prevails over 
the mothers claim that her right against selfincrimination will 
be violated if she is forced to reveal the childs whereabouts the 
supreme court said 
justice sandra day oconnor wrote for the court that ms 
bouknights claim that her constitutional rights are being violated 
is particularly weak because of her agreement with welfare 
officials 
concern for the childs safety oconnor said underlay 
the efforts to gain access to and then compel production of 
bouknights son 
but justice thurgood marshall in a dissenting opinion accused 
the court of riding roughshod over individual rights 
public defender george burns jr who represented bouknight 
said the ruling indicated that if she were forced to disclose 
information on the whereabouts of the boy the information might 
not be able to be used against her in a criminal proceeding 
there is at least the suggestion that if the state forced her 
to talk or produce something that they may not let the state use 
that in a criminal proceeding a kind of limited immunity 
statute burns said 
some observers said the ruling could provide a new weapon for 
officials seeking to protect children from parental abuse 
ernie allen president of the center for missing and exploited 
children in arlington va said the court recognized that the 
privilege against selfincrimination is limited 
in a case like this there is a legitimate valid public 
purpose for the state to act and intervene to do what it can to 
protect the safety of a child allen said 
mitchell merviss the attorney representing maurice said 
parents have to be accountable to society for the care they give 
their children 
our hope is the mother will cooperate now thats her 
choice he said

issued by community health centers according to a statement from 
lederle laboratories the company making the grant 
the vouchers will be issued through 600 communitybased health 
centers affiliated with the national association of community 
health centers 
lederle based in wayne nj also is giving 1 million to the 
childrens health fund to help bring health care to homeless 
families and children the group cofounded by dr irwin redlener 
of the new york hospitalcornell medical center pioneered programs 
to reach the homeless including the first mobile health units for 
the homeless in new york city

a sheriff who took over a national 
guard armory as a remedy to jail overcrowding promised not to back 
down as state lawyers worked to oust him 
right from the beginning i planned on digging in michael 
ashe said thats where im at i want to indicate that im not 
above the law i dont feel i violated any law 
at a hearing in hampden superior court tuesday judge george 
keady granted state officials 48 hours to come up with arguments 
why ashe should stop using the armory attorneys representing the 
county had asked that the situation be made permanent 
state officials say ashe has no business using the armory as 
temporary quarters for overflow prisoners but ashe said the 
alternative was putting the prisoners on the street 
the sheriff said he is backed up by a 17thcentury statute 
commanding him to keep the peace 
i can understand the national guard feeling put upon being 
thrust into a situation all i can say is this was not done 
irrationally ashe said 
the sheriff fended off eviction monday when a judge granted a 
temporary restraining order ruling that the prisoners could stay 
put life at the temporary jail became a little more comfortable 
when the judge ordered the national guard to turn over keys to the 
showers and kitchen 
tuesday a lone patrol car sat in the armorys parking lot 
unauthorized visitors were shooed away by deputies keeping close 
guard on the door the 15 prisoners quartered in bunk beds on the 
armorys drill floor were busy at their daytime jobs said richard 
mccarthy ashes spokesman 
the hampden county jail built to hold 279 inmates and under 
federal orders to house no more than 500 is a fourtier redbrick 
building featuring 6foot by 8foot cells and narrow hallways with 
antique fixtures 
with its narrow peep holes built into brick walls and a small 
dusty yard it resembles lockups of 1940s gangster movies 
a new jail is scheduled to be built in nearby ludlow but that 
is at least two years away 
meanwhile the 5yearold twostory armory seemed like a 
solution said ashe who has let 1200 inmates go on earlyrelease 
programs since the federal cap took effect in the fall of 1988 
the idea first came up last week when a westfield district judge 
detained two of ashes deputies angry that they wouldnt take a 
prisoner to the already full jail the judge said ashe had 
responsibility for housing prisoners and should take whatever steps 
necessary 
ashe citing a 1648 law that he said gave him authority to take 
necessary steps to preserve public safety marched into the armory 
on friday and informed the national guard he was taking over 
he later installed 15 prisoners and guards were posted 
gov michael s dukakis said tuesday the armory takeover is not 
a solution to the problem 
the answer to this problem is prison expansion at ludlow and 
new braintree he said

publishers scholars and freespeech advocates 
are bemoaning the supreme courts refusal to overturn a ruling that 
drastically limits the right of authors to quote unpublished 
material such as diaries and letters 
the justices without comment refused tuesday to hear an appeal 
by a company that published a biography attacking the late l ron 
hubbard founder of the church of scientology 
that left intact a ruling last april by the 2nd us circuit 
court of appeals that imposed strict limits on the use of 
quotations from unpublished material 
e gabriel perle a lawyer who represents the association of 
american publishers said the appeals court ruling could put a 
permanent chill on the use of important source material by 
biographers and historians 
the 2nd circuit decision is an inexplicable inhibition on 
scholarly writing and publishing it is a clearly a misapplication 
of the law perle said it makes it impossible for scholars to 
use quotations without fear their works will be banned 
but michael lee hertzberg a lawyer for the scientologists 
minimized the importance of the appeals court ruling 
there is in effect an important right in the creator of a 
work to control the first dissemination of that work the only 
thing protected here is creative expression he said 
in a busy return from a fourweek winter recess the supreme 
court also 
ruled 72 that parents suspected of child abuse sometimes may 
be jailed indefinitely for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of 
their children the court permitted the indefinite jailing of a 
maryland woman for refusing to tell authorities the location of her 
young son who is feared dead 
made it easier for disabled children to win some federal 
welfare benefits the 72 decision in a pennsylvania case could 
force the government to reevaluate benefits for some 250000 
children 
agreed to use an ohio case to decide whether prosecutors who 
exclude blacks as jurors because of their race violate the rights 
of white defendants 
left intact baltimore md ordinances requiring the citys 
employee pension plans to divest themselves of all investments in 
companies doing business with south africa 
in the scientologists case the 2nd circuit court said federal 
copyright law generally bars use of unpublished material without 
permission the appeals court rejected arguments that the ban 
violates constitutionally protected free expression 
the ruling relied in part on an earlier 2nd circuit court 
decision barring random house from publishing a biography of author 
jd salinger unless quotations from and paraphrases of 
salingers letters were deleted 
because of a technicality the appeals court refused to block 
further publication of the hubbard biography entitled barefaced 
messiah the appeals court said the copyright owners who are 
affiliated with the scientologists waited too long to seek a court 
order blocking publication 
ironically that made henry holt and co publisher of the 
biography the technical winner before the appeals court 
it also may have contributed to the supreme courts refusal to 
review the 2nd circuit court ruling 
in its appeal holt said the 2nd circuit court ruling is a grave 
threat to the publishing industry because the appeals court is 
based in new york city home to most of the nations major book 
publishers 
lawyers for holt said the ruling means the copyright law that 
was intended to promote the progress of the useful arts is now 
repeatedly being used to muzzle responsible biographers and 
historians 
among the groups supporting the holt appeal were the american 
historical association and the authors guild 
barefaced messiah written by russell miller accuses 
hubbard of fakery and deception holt said quoting from hubbards 
unpublished letters and diaries was intended to expose the church 
founders lies

lessening soviet threat to the west is adding at least five major 
weapons systems to its list of programs being studied for possible 
cuts 
pressed by members of a senate panel about scaling back 
programs deputy defense secretary donald j atwood said tuesday 
that the administration likely would review the two landbased 
nuclear missiles and the ssn21 seawolf attack submarine 
the pentagon already is studying possible scaling back of plans 
for the b2 stealth bomber the advanced tactical fighter the 
advanced tactical aircraft and the c17 transport 
atwood told the senate appropriations subcommittee on defense 
the review should be completed before midyear when the panel begins 
crafting a defense spending bill for the fiscal year beginning oct 
1 
atwood said among the additional candidates for review are the 
alreadydeployed multiplewarhead mx missile which the pentagon 
wants to base on rail cars the planned singlewarhead midgetman 
missile based on special trucks and the attack submarine 
we do have these studies ongoing they are looking at the best 
assessments of the requirements based on our visualization of what 
the defense needs will be and do they need them atwood said 
asked whether the ssn21 submarine was under review atwood 
said we are considering picking up another five to seven 
major programs major issues and this may well be one of them 
he did not list all the programs he had in mind 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the panel predicted 
congress will likely choose either the mx or midgetman missiles 
this fiscal year instead of providing funds for both as it did in 
past years 
inouye also warned that the administrations attempt to delay 
22 billion in pentagon expenditures this year could prove costly 
for the fiscal 1991 defense budget 
administrations routinely ask congress to delay billions in 
planned spending each year by law these requests called 
deferrals are permissible because of unexpected contingencies or 
a chance to save money through better management 
the deferrals can be blocked by a majority vote of either house 
of congress 
policy considerations are not considered reasons for such delays 
to be requested yet according to the documents bush sent lawmakers 
dated feb 6 the administration justifies many of the deferrals 
with the statement this proposal reflects changes in 
requirements in view of promising developments in the soviet union 
and eastern europe 
inouye questioned atwood on where the administration found 
this authority to make such deferrals 
the deputy defense secretary said the deferrals all came about 
as change in requirements 
but the committee chairman said he found the logic of changes 
in requirements in view of the changes in the soviet union to be a 
rather dangerous one that we also could use to do away with these 
other programs sdi b2 and such 
and im certain that many members of the congress are looking 
at this logic

the navy has found no evidence of espionage as a 
factor in the fatal shootings of two sailors at a topsecret base 
the slaying of a pawnshop clerk and the apparent suicide of a third 
sailor 
but a lawyer for the third sailors family who raised the 
possibility of spy involvement said tuesday that naval 
investigative service agents apparently are just not talking to 
the right people 
the lawyer larry scruggs jr of milwaukee also said in a 
telephone interview he believed his safety and that of the sailors 
survivors had been jeopardized since he raised the espionage issue 
he refused to identify his sources on that question or disclose the 
reasons for his safety concerns 
lt cmdr keith arterburn at the trident nuclear submarine base 
at bangor about 20 miles west of seattle said scruggs refused to 
give navy investigators his sources and never previously mentioned 
any fears for his personal security 
ive been in my opinion very cooperative with the naval 
investigative services investigators scruggs said there are 
some things i cannot disclose at this time because of concern for 
my sources and my clients 
relatives of 23yearold shyam david drizpaul whose body was 
found jan 17 in a motel near vancouver wash said they hired 
scruggs because they did not believe the police and navy accounts 
authorities believe that drizpaul a guyana native who lived in 
milwaukee killed david allen parker 21 of san diego and scott 
anthony seely 18 of north ridgeville ohio at the base on jan 
16 and a few hours later fatally shot julie lynn tuscher 24 at 
the charleston pawnshop in bremerton 
the clerks brother 28yearold allan michaels who was 
critically wounded in the pawnshop shooting identified drizpaul as 
the attacker and said he took a gun from the store that was found 
with the body at the motel 
the navy believes drizpaul committed suicide 
scruggs believes drizpaul was killed 
a navy statement said 35 investigators had conducted more than 
500 interviews talking to some people more than once and had only 
a few people still to contact in the case 
the investigation has not disclosed any indication of 
espionage or espionagerelated activity the navy statement said 
tuesday 
thats pretty much settled arterburn said 
scruggs said drizpaul apparently had a girlfriend identified to 
the lawyer only as cindy who worked evenings attended school by 
day and may have obtained sensitive information on the trident a 
key component of the nations nuclear deterrent 
scruggs said the woman was mentioned by sources in milwaukee and 
the west coast including some who actually saw a photograph of 
this individual 
navy investigators have been unable to find anyone who said 
drizpaul had a girlfriend nor has the name cindy been mentioned in 
interviews in connection with him seely or parker arterburn said 
he added that he had never heard before of any picture 
a motel housekeeper marcy plonski initially told a reporter 
she saw a womans long evening jacket in the room where drizpauls 
body was found but navy investigators found no sign of any 
outerwear except a mans tan trenchcoat the navy statement 
said 
she also told a reporter she had seen a box of what appeared to 
be business papers in the car drizpaul drove to the motel but 
investigators said she told them she never saw such a box the navy 
statement said

the walls of jericho did come tumbling down as 
recounted in the bible according to an archaeological study 
when we compare the archaeological evidence at jericho with 
the biblical narrative describing the israelite destruction of 
jericho we find remarkable agreement said archaeologist byrant 
g wood of the university of toronto 
after studying data from recently published excavation reports 
of british archaeologist kathleen kenyon wood wrote in the 
marchapril issue of the scholarly journal biblical archaeology 
review 
here is impressive evidence that the walls of jericho did 
indeed topple as the bible records 
ms kenyon had concluded after her excavations in the 1950s that 
the fortified city was destroyed about 1550 bc and was no longer 
there at the time of the israelite invasion dated after 1400 bc 
as a result for about 30 years scholars by and large have 
written off the biblical record as so much folklore and religious 
rhetoric wood said 
however he said extensive ceramic remnants and a carbon14 
sample contradict ms kenyons dating of the citys fall and other 
evidence converged to support the biblical account 
the correlation between the archaeological evidence and the 
biblical narrative is substantial he said 
as described in joshua 6 joshuas army marched around the city 
for a week blowing rams horns and on the seventh day combined 
shouting with the piercing horns and the wall fell down flat 
wood noted that collapsed mud bricks were found outside a thick 
lower revetment wall where they had fallen and apparently served 
as a ramp for the israelites described as going up into the 
city 
also the bible relates the event occurred after spring harvest 
and that the israelites burned the city both factors confirmed by 
the archeological remains wood said 
he said the siege of the city obviously was short as indicated 
by the large amounts of scorched grain found 
the presence of these grain stores in the destroyed city is 
entirely consistent with the biblical account wood wrote the 
city did not fall as a result of a starvation siege as was so 
common in ancient times 
instead the bible tells us jericho was destroyed after but 
seven days 
wood noted that jericho is situated in the rift valley an 
unstable region where earthquakes are frequent and he suggested a 
quake could have caused both the tumbling wall and also temporary 
blocking of the jordan river 
that is described in joshua 316 allowing the israelites to 
cross on land 
historians and bible scholars have focused on the miraculous 
nature of the event with little regard for the seismology of the 
southern jordan valley 
he said that mudslides caused by quakes have blocked the jordan 
a number of times in recent recorded history so the stoppage 
of the jordans flow as described in the bible is not so 
farfetched as it might at first seem

the bush administration insists that neither 
troops nor caterpillars will be dispatched to fight the cocaine 
wars in south america without an invitation from the host country 
the pledge came in reference to an agriculture department 
program that is researching development of voracious caterpillars 
to kill off coca plants 
the department in a research program that president bush 
proposes to increase by 5 million to 65 million in fiscal 1991 
is looking at a white moth that when in its caterpillar stage 
eats coca plant leaves 
we are not undertaking any biological war said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater neither troops nor caterpillars 
will go in without prior request and consultation 
on a related topic he said us officials had known there was a 
possibility that drug terrorists had surfacetoair missiles when 
bush flew to colombia for last weeks fournation drug summit but 
that the reports were never confirmed 
ten such weapons were seized by colombian police on monday 
there was intelligence before we left of various kinds about 
missiles and rockets and other kinds of equipment about people 
with various plans fitzwater said 
the summit was attended by the presidents of peru colombia and 
bolivia the three leading cocaineproducing countries 
the unleashing of a defoliation caterpillar in those countries 
would open a new era in coca eradication efforts 
but fitzwater and don hamilton a spokesman for national drug 
control policy director william bennett emphasized that the insect 
research program is in the experimental stage 
hamilton said the proposal is to look at all drug plants to 
try and learn as much as we can about them including herbicides 
and natural enemies of the plants this isnt something that is an 
option yet its a prospect of an option 
a peruvian embassy spokesman said that after the washington post 
ran a story on the caterpillar program tuesday us officials 
assured the ambassador that no such program would be initiated in 
peru without limas approval 
a bolivian official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
his countrys environmental concerns have prompted it to reject the 
use of chemical agents against coca crops and likely would also 
reject biological agents 
some environmental activists also were wary about the idea 
coca growing and processing already are extremely 
destructive to the environment because of the insecticides and 
the harsh chemicals employed said sandra marquardt pesticide 
information coordinator for greenpeace usa 
but instead of the caterpillars producing a nice biological 
control youll have growers adding ever more insecticides to an 
already destructive production program she said 
eric christensen a natural resources defense council attorney 
said he is extremely dubious that such a program could be 
launched without producing potentially major environmental 
consequences either from spreading an exotic pest that could have 
farreaching consequences or from producing a major increase in 
pesticide usage

share prices on the tokyo stock exchange plunged 
amid fears of rising interest rates wednesday with the main market 
index dropping more than 3 percent in the third largest singleday 
dive in history 
the us dollar meanwhile firmed against the japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues the most 
widelyfollowed index lost 116119 points or 315 percent to 
close at 3573433 on tuesday it shed 32708 points 
it was the third largest singleday decline for the nikkei index 
and its sharpest since oct 23 1987 when the benchmark index lost 
120323 points in the aftermath of the aroundtheworld stock 
market crash known as black monday 
analysts attributed the plunge to a combination of negative 
factors particularly fears of rising interest rates which also 
depressed bond prices and the poor showing of new york and london 
markets overnight 
despite the sharp decline some analysts and dealers said 
investors remained calm coolly watching the falling share prices 
from the sidelines 
there have been hardly any buying incentives in the stock 
market since the beginning of the year said keiichi nishida a 
dealer with the kidder peabody securities the 3percent decline 
today may look a lot but at least i can say it was not the result 
of investors panicselling 
in the currency market the dollar closed at 14515 yen up 057 
yen from tuesdays close of 14458 yen after opening at 14555 
yen the currency moved in a range of 1451014560 yen 
currency dealers attributed the dollars strength to 
expectations that us interest rates wont decline soon 
alan greenspan chairman of the us federal reserve board said 
in a us congressional hearing tuesday that economic growth was 
likely to pick up indicating the fed will not relax monetary 
policy any time soon 
the speculation that japans central bank might raise its 
discount rate has been making market players nervous said a 
dealer at daiichi kangyo bank who asked that his name be withheld 
the discount rate which japans central bank charges on its 
loans to commercial banks currently stands at 425 percent many 
market participants have speculated that the bank of japan might 
raise the countrys key interest rate now that the parliamentary 
elections are over

the yearold free trade agreement between the 
united states and canada is having little national impact on 
farmers according to an agriculture department report 
one reason is that the uscanada agreement was negotiated at 
the same time agriculture had the international spotlight in the 
uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade said 
alan webb of the departments economic research service 
the uscanada pact went into effect jan 1 1989 and was 
designed to remove all tariff and some nontariff barriers to 
agricultural trade between the two countries within 10 years 
the gatt talks probably caused both countries to restrain the 
scope of their bilateral agricultural negotiations webb said in 
the february issue of farmline magazine neither side wanted to 
make major concessions that would have reduced their bargaining 
chips in the larger multilateral gatt talks 
but the looming presence of gatt did help spur some progress on 
agriculture in the uscanada agreement largely because it would 
have appeared as bad form not to have some favorable results 
for two relatively friendly open countries to admit defeat on 
negotiating something on agriculture would have sent a bad signal 
to the international community particularly since both countries 
maintain that the real culprits in international agricultural trade 
are the european community and japan webb said 
canada and the united states have similarities in agricultural 
production and trade meaning there are few reasons to negotiate 
changes or opportunities for tradeoffs also he said agricultural 
trade with the united states and the freetrade agreement are 
far more important to canada than the other way around 
webb said the us view was that the small size of the canadian 
market did not justify large concessions 
the united states would not make major changes in its domestic 
agricultural policies particularly those which would affect 
headtohead competition with canada in other export markets on 
the basis of canadian concessions on agriculture he said 
but webb said that in the larger multilateral talks of the 
uruguay round significant changes in domestic policies are more 
likely

an agriculture department report shows 1990 
farm income estimates are holding as predicted although there is 
some slippage from the record level of two years ago 
net cash income may be in the range of 52 billion to 57 
billion compared with an estimated 53 billion in 1989 and the 
record of 572 billion in 1988 the report said tuesday 
that is the money left over after deducting cash expenses from 
gross cash income during a calendar year it can include proceeds 
from sales of inventory commodities produced in previous years 
net farm income another method of bookkeeping may be in the 
range of 44 billion to 49 billion this year compared with 48 
billion in 1989 and 427 billion in 1988 
this method measures income from farming during a specific year 
including changes in the value of inventories allowances for 
family dwellings depreciation and other factors 
figures for both accounting methods were unchanged from 
projections made by the departments economic research service the 
last two months 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter noted in testimony before 
the house agriculture committee earlier tuesday virtually all 
indicators of farm sector wellbeing have improved the last few 
years 
farm income is up farm failures are down farmland values are 
recovering and debttoasset ratios have improved yeutter said 
commodity surpluses have all but disappeared some idle land has 
returned to production and farm program spending is down 
the agency report said farmland values have been revised based 
on the 1987 census of agriculture the average us price of 
farmland as of february 1989 for example was revised upward to 
667 per acre from the earlier estimate of 597 no state figures 
were included

the red cross decision against spending 
most of the 525 million in earthquake relief donations on other 
disasters won praise from community leaders as necessary to prevent 
a breach of faith with the public 
when people indicate they want their money spent in a certain 
way i think their desires should be acknowledged oakland mayor 
lionel wilson said 
in a reversal the red cross promised tuesday to spend the 
entire 525 million for earthquake relief in northern california 
the move followed criticism from san francisco mayor art agnos and 
others over its plans to put at least 304 million of the money in 
an account administered by its washington dc office for other 
disasters 
we needed to take some action to reestablish good faith with 
our donors to keep the trust and confidence with them said 
barbara lohman a spokesman for the american red cross regional 
office in burlingame 
the 109yearold nonprofit international relief organization 
has spent 121 million on emergency relief for the 100mile 
stretch of northern california devastated by the 71magnitude 
quake on oct 17 
the agency had promised to spend only another 10 million on 
longterm rebuilding programs contending there had not been a 
demonstrated need for using the rest of the money here 
oakland and alameda county officials are seeking 187 million 
from the agency for housing and other assistance programs for 
earthquake victims 
agnos had sought at least 10 million from the red cross much 
of it to meet the needs of homeless people 
agnos had chided the red cross for considering taking that money 
out of northern california which sustained 7 billion to 10 
billion in damage from the largest quake here since the 1906 great 
earthquake 
theres a lot of unmet needs here he said 
the 12 million already spent by the red cross has supplied 
food clothing emergency rents and medical aid lohman said 
several million dollars worth of other supplies also have been 
provided by the red cross and will have to be paid for from the 
relief fund lohman said 
following the quake the red cross set up 45 shelters helping 
more than 14000 families and providing 500000 meals the red 
cross still operates two shelters one each in oakland and san 
francisco that serve a total of about 400 people 
the decision not to transfer earthquake funds out of the region 
was made over the weekend after discussions between george f 
moody national chairman of the red cross and the agencys 
executive committee of its board of governors a volunteer group 
that oversees red cross operations 
lohman said the red cross does not have a policy requiring it to 
use all donations designated for a specific disaster in those 
programs 
the extra 30 million will be used to fund proposals already 
submitted by officials of the quakestricken areas including the 
cities of san francisco santa cruz watsonville and oakland 
the allocations will be announced in midmarch

the search for fake grill marks on hot 
dogs has spawned a promising byproduct that advertisers may 
relish frank ads 
a peek between the buns could reveal hebrew national go 
dodgers or some other promotional message tattooed on the 
frankfurter if viskase corps idea takes hold 
viskase one of the worlds biggest producers of hot dog 
holders has developed the ez mark nojax cellulose casing the 
company says it allows a hot dog maker to transfer a message 
printed in a usdaapproved foodgrade ingredient from the 
casing to the meat 
viskase spokesman doug morris says the company steamed up the 
idea of making the hot dog an edible billboard while trying to 
figure out how to put fake grill marks on franks to make them look 
barbecued 
morris predicted that the printed dogs could begin turning up at 
special events and promotions within two months 
but john trosper of ara leisure services inc concessions 
manager at anaheim stadium said hes not sure the idea would work 
at the ballparks highvolume refreshment stands 
our hot dogs are already cooked and in a bun and wrapped when 
theyre sold he said you wouldnt see the message and by

gov rafael hernandez colon says 
the us commonwealths public telephone company will be sold to 
private investors and the proceeds used to improve education and 
public services 
this means there wont be one school in puerto rico that is 
not painted repaired the governor said in his state of the 
commonwealth address tuesday that no school lacks desks 
blackboards chalk that no child lacks books or the necessary 
supplies for an education 
colon said the puerto rico telephone co is the only company 
which has enough value to generate the money needed to revamp 
puerto ricos school system and the caribbean islands 
infrastructure 
he said he would sell it for no less than 2 billion 
it was not immediately known if there is a buyer for the 
telephone company 
hernandez colon was in new york city in january and met with the 
billonaire financier donald trump the governor refused to provide 
details but said then they discussed ways to invest in education 
reform plans 
at the time hernandez colon said trump was interested 
the governor said without elaboration that telefonica espanola 
the spanish telephone company is one of the enterprises that 
could be interested in the longdistance service 
hernandez colon said he wanted to create two perpetual funds 
from the telephone company sale a 1 billion fund for education 
and a 1 billion fund to modernize the islands highways public 
housing airports waste dumps and energy operations 
the government would use interest from those funds for the 
improvements the governor said 
hernandez colon said the government bought the telephone company 
during his 1974 administration for 165 million when it was in 
total abandonment and had only 300000 telephone lines 
he said the company which made 70 million in net income last 
year now accounts for 1 million telephones in the spanishspeaking 
us commonwealth of 33 million people hernandez colon said that 
in private hands the telephone company can make at least 170 
million a year 
technologically puerto rico telephone is among the most 
advanced in the world he said 
the companys puerto rico long distance subsidiary has an 
estimated 200 million longdistance market 
hernandez colon said he will introduce legislation stipulating 
none of the telephone companys nearly 8000 jobs would be affected 
by the sale and that there be no rate increases for three years 
after it is bought 
the governor has long said educational reform revamping 
schools classrooms and textbooks and providing salary increases 
for teachers was a priority of his administration he repeated 
his pledge when he was reelected in november 1988

president bushs free trade approach to 
western europes drive towards a onemarket economy by 1992 is 
drawing fresh criticism in congress as american companies relocate 
plants and jobs across the atlantic to avoid being frozen out 
officials in the state and commerce departments and the us 
trade representatives office were barraged tuesday with harsh 
attacks by both democrats and members of the presidents own party 
lets be honest our trade policy is to have no policy said 
conservative rep toby roth rwis who complained bush is still 
living in the 1950s and 60s with his freetrade beliefs 
were in a real economic battle and you say free trade 
and nothing happens roth said during a hearing before the house 
foreign affairs trade subcommittee thats the problem 
the officials acknowledged they were unsuccessful in stopping 
the 12member european community from adopting restrictions on 
broadcasting last october that would allow member countries to keep 
us television shows and movies off their airwaves 
but we have not left the playing field on that one let me 
assure you said peter allgeier the assistant us trade 
representative for europe 
subcommittee chairman sam gejdenson dconn complained the 
administration hasnt even put a full team on the field yet citing 
unfilled posts that congress created last year to monitor the ec 
92 negotiations taking place in brussels 
our single biggest trading partner is changing all the rules 
of the game he said while the administration is treating the 
issue as something we can get around to in the lazy hazy days of 
summer it just boggles the mind 
gejdenson cited recent decisions by general electric co and 
united technologies corp to move some of their jet engine 
facilities from the united states to europe 
he said several semiconductor manufacturers have reversed their 
initial plans to build new plants here and instead are going to put 
them in europe in order to assure access to the market there after 
1992 
this isnt a simply a debate between liberalization and 
protectionism gejdenson asserted companies in this country 
have decided that youre not going to get the job done so theyre 
moving their investments to europe 
administration officials acknowledged their prediction a year 
ago that the ec 92 process would move slowly has been overtaken by 
the overthrow of communist governments in eastern europe and the 
crumbling of the berlin wall 
assistant secretary of state eugene mcallister said moves this 
month to reunify east and west germany could very well help speed 
up the adoption of a singlemarket economy for all of western 
europe 
many of the ec nations are intent upon keeping germany western 
oriented and they see ec 92 as a very important contributing 
factor to that he said french president francois 
mitterrand has stated that in very blunt terms 
gejdenson complained bush continues to shun threats of 
retaliation while ec members draft protectionist directives against 
imports of us agriculture and bigticket items such as 
telecommunications and electrical equipment 
he cited memorandums of understanding assuring italy and the 
netherlands continued wide access to pentagon procurement contracts 
regardless of the trade talks 
the one thing we have in our cards is access to american 
defense procurement he said did any of you guys ever play 
poker you have to have chips you need cards in your hand what 
are you threatening the europeans with that youll go home empty 
allgeier called defense procurement a very sensitive issue 
within the administration but pledged we will use whatever 
leverage we can

union leaders accused the bush 
administration of favoring eastern airlines in its bitter 11month 
dispute with machinists but administration officials said the 
president has remained neutral 
aflcio leaders gathered at their annual winter meeting 
charged tuesday that the federal government has a 120 million 
contract with eastern 
lane kirkland head of the 141million member federation 
suggested that president bush had been influenced by lobbyists for 
texas air corp easterns parent 
theyre not collecting fees for nothing he said 
in a letter sent to bush tuesday george kourpias president of 
the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
said the contract is not the impartial act of an evenhanded 
federal executive it is the biased antagonism of an underhanded 
administration 
but us labor secretary elizabeth dole told reporters there was 
no favoritism toward texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
she said lorenzos labor practices leave a lot to be 
desired and promised to look into the alleged contract for 
federal travel services 
at the white house after labor leaders met with mrs dole in 
florida deputy press secretary stephen hart said the labor 
department assures us that there is no such contract 
an administration official speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said the issue involves general services administration 
guidelines on preferred citytocity airline rates for couriers 
the machinists union calculated what the maximum benefit in 
income to eastern might be from these guidelines and came up with 
the 120 million figure the official said 
eastern filed for bankruptcy reorganization law five days after 
the machinists union walked out in march 1989 and the carrier has 
hired replacement workers as it attempts to reduce its size 
eastern faced a midnight tuesday deadline for submitting a 
reorganization plan to a federal bankruptcy judge

the senate is embroiled in debate over the 
armenian genocide that is pitting gop members against the bush 
administration and threatening to poison relations with turkey 
led by senate minority leader robert dole rkan supporters of 
the controversial resolution say the measure is an effort to 
remember the 15 million armenians who were killed in 19151923 
during the ottoman empire because of their ethnic background the 
ottoman empire is now turkey 
opponents of the measure said it could sour us relations with 
turkey a nato ally and threaten the future of military bases in 
the moslem country 
the senate was expected to continue debate today with a cloture 
vote scheduled on thursday to cut off debate sixty senators must 
approve that motion before a vote on the measure can be taken 
it is time for the senate the congress the united states 
government it is time finally for all of us to do what is 
right said dole its time for the united states officially 
to commemorate the armenian genocide 
dole sponsored the resolution to make april 24 a national day of 
remembrance of the anniversary of the armenian genocide 
19151923 
turkey is fiercely opposed to the measure and has objected to 
the term genocide prime minister turgut ozal has said the 
measure has united all turks 
i am deeply concerned that if the senate passes the 
resolution it will unwittingly slap the face of a very important 
nato ally said sen robert byrd dwva an opponent 
byrd was the only senator to speak against the measure tuesday 
others supporting it included sens claiborne pell dri 
chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and pete 
wilson rcalif a gubernatorial candidate in a state with a large 
armenianamerican population 
much of the debate centered tuesday over the term genocide 
which byrd said may not apply to the massacre of armenians under 
the strict definition of the geneva convention 
although the bush administration opposes the resolution the 
measure is a potential source of embarrassment for president bush 
who said during the 1988 campaign that he would be inclined to 
support it 
sen paul simon dill quoted bush as saying during 1988 that 
the united states must acknowledge the attempted genocide of 
the armenians i would join congress in commemorating the victims 
of that period simon quoted bush as saying 
clearly a different signal is coming from the white house 
today he said 
doles spokesman walt riker said the senator and white house 
officials had tried unsuccessfully to arrive at compromise language 
on the resolution dole has rejected any effort to water down the 
language but said he might offer amendments that contain less 
offensive words when the measure reaches the senate floor 
dole complained about the massive lobbying effort to block 
the measure which was passed last year by the senate judiciary 
committee 
he said the resolution had 61 cosponsors last year but today 
has only 46 cosponsors 
what has changed is the launching of a massive lobbying effort 
against the resolution by the administration by the government 
of turkey by american businesses who operate in turkey and 
regrettably by some private organizations and individuals who 
ought to be supportive of the resolution he said 
last year dole wrote to the israeli ambassador asking if israel 
had asked some jewish groups to work against the measure according 
to riker turkey is a moslem country that has relations with israel 
meantime turkey has already taken steps to show its displeasure 
at the resolution the country has banned ports of call by us 
nuclearpowered warships and barred flights by training missions 
into a gunnery range according to mike mcnamara who represents 
turkey

the maiden voyage of czechoslovakias new 
reformist government to the united states was a symbolic 
fullcircle return to values long cherished by czechs and slovaks 
but also an exciting personal experience for members of the 
delegation 
when president vaclav havel shook president bushs hand inside 
the white house it was a beginning of a new era a strong reminder 
of 1918 when woodrow wilson played a key role in establishing free 
czechoslovakia and an overwhelming victory for havel a former 
dissident playwright 
havel the first president in czechoslovak history to visit 
washington with full honors of a head of state still remembers the 
first time 22 years ago when he visited the united states as a 
promising writer and human rights activist 
the difference is not that i am the president now but rather 
that we did not have freedom and now we do havel said on 
nbctvs today show on tuesday 
his countrymen have always looked up to american ideals of 
democratic freedom and private enterprise but often history took 
them in a different direction 
the munich pact stripped czechoslovakia of meaningful defense 
against hitler in 1938 communists took over with soviet support 10 
years later and warsaw pact tanks crushed alexander dubceks 
prague spring in 1968 
but in the tradition of his absurdist plays it took havel no 
more than 41 days to lead his country from the spiritual depression 
caused by four decades of communist rule to national euphoria 
during his inauguration on dec 29 
for some time i knew things had to change but nobody was more 
surprised when they did havel told about 500 students at the 
gaston hall of georgetown university on tuesday 
the presidential ilyushin plane also carried a 7omember 
delegation of government officials havels former 
comradesinarms fellow artists and friends 
many had never before visited the united states while others 
had to wait many years to return 
jiri dienstbier once was sentenced by communists to four years 
in jail and a menial job of a furnace stoker only to come back as 
czechoslovak foreign minister to washington where he worked as 
prague radio correspondent in 1968 
he still loves new york as the second best town in the world 
next to prague and clearly enjoys the frantic schedule of a 
highly popular foreign minister who visited more than 10 countries 
in january alone 
in two months more has happened in czechoslovak diplomatic 
life than in the last 10 years before that rozarka hunatova 
dienstbiers adviser said at a party given tuesday night by the 
czechoslovak embassy in havels honor 
we have not seen anything like this as far as i can 
remember said karel huska a senior czechoslovak diplomat 
serving his third year in washington more than 800 people thronged 
the onceplacid embassy where an adjacent tent was built to 
accommodate the guests 
how do you like america a reporter asked olga havlova the 
presidents wife who shook hands with tearyeyed countrymen who 
came to see their hero 
its okay she replied while the president joined in the 
chorus of the czech version of on top of old smokey rendered 
by waldemar matuska an exiled czech singer now living in florida 
vaclav klaus the multilingual finance minister who spent 20 
years in the obscurity of a bank clerk asked a reporter the 
village voice you mean the village still exists i remember it 20 
years ago 
the mood was relaxed in spite of another 16hour working day 
for the czechoslovak delegation frequent flights countless 
meetings and ceremonial receptions 
we started out with having to sit through one of his havels 
plays in a reykjavik theatre for over two hours and listening to 
the whole thing in icelandic but from then on it was just great 
a delegation member quipped 
during six hectic days of his tour havel visited iceland and 
canada met with bush on tuesday addresses a joint meeting of 
congress today and attends a starstudded concert in his honor in 
new york on thursday 
the trip will undoubtedly produce a better understanding of 
economic and political relations between the two countries vice 
premier vladimir dlouhy said 
what i like best are the motorcades added his assistant 
but somebody should find our luggage which got lost on its way to 
the blair house

three house members just back from nicaragua 
are predicting a stunning upset victory for opposition candidate 
violeta chamorro over leftist president daniel ortega in sundays 
national elections 
if i were a betting man id go with the longshot i think 
shes going to upset him said rep gary ackerman dny who 
made the trip with reps stephen solarz dny and doug bosco 
dcalif 
i think shes got the votes ackerman said basing his 
prediction on the responses of crowds at uno rallies last week in 
the area around the capital of managua and on conversations with 
citizens who appear confident of the elections integrity 
ackerman said he went to nicaragua sharing the widely held view 
that mrs chamorros campaign has been so weak and that ortegas 
ruling leftist sandinista party holds such a grip on the country 
that the election was no contest 
i came away with a different perspective he said in an 
interview 
an abcwashington post poll released tuesday indicated that 
ortega held a 16 percentage point lead over mrs chamorro 48 
percent to 32 percent 
the abcwashington post poll was based on interviews with 925 
likely nicaraguan voters on feb 1115 the margin of error was 
plus or minus 35 percentage points 
polls have generally put the sandinistas ahead however experts 
caution that polling in less developed countries such as nicaragua 
is at best a tricky business 
ackerman said the group was impressed by the vigorous campaign 
being waged by both the sandinistas and the 14party opposition 
coalition known as uno 
theres a real genuine knockdown dragout hometown 
campaign going on he said 
the sandinistas have erected billboards showing ortega holding a 
child and promising a better future for the country ackerman also 
said the sandinistas are using telemarketing to make calls that 
feature a recorded message from your president 
one lady said she was called four times ackerman said 
while mrs chamorros side has few of those political trappings 
she draws large enthusiastic crowds at rallies he said the head 
of the countrys roman catholic church cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo has done everything but make an outright endorsement of uno 
ackerman said 
but most telling he said was that voters questioned by the 
congressmen consistently told them my vote is secret an 
indication of faith in the voting process that bodes ill for ortega 
people remember they were hungry yesterday and that their 
kids couldnt go to school they really have little hope except 
in overturning things ackerman said 
with the countrys economy in a shambles after a decade of civil 
war you dont want to validate the past you want a change he 
said

the state department says it is not 
threatening cuba when it says it simply cannot tolerate such 
developments as cubas receipt of a new shipment of 
highperformance soviet fighter planes 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler confirmed tuesday that 
cuba has received a delivery of new mig29 jet fighters although 
ms tutwiler gave no figure the washington times reported in 
tuesdays editions that six were received 
ms tutwiler quoted baker as saying cuba is actively 
supporting the insurgency in el salvador and it is these kind of 
activities close to the shores of the united states that we simply 
cannot tolerate however she said the statement intended no 
threat to cuba 
ms tutwiler referred reporters to secretary of state james a 
baker iiis recent testimony before a soviet legislative committee 
in which he said cuba posed no threat to the united states 
the report said the combined total of migs in cubas arsenal has 
risen to more than 300 most of them older models 
ms tutwiler noted baker had told the soviet legislators during 
a visit to moscow earlier this month that the united states has 
difficulty understanding why the kremlin continues to send mig29s 
to cuba particularly at a time when cuba has been so critical of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs reform policies

social securitys tollfree telephone network 
is coming under fire from members of congress who say the new 
national phone system has depersonalized service and too often 
offers busy signals and wrong answers to frustrated callers 
when our nations government starts throwing machines where 
experienced people belong service becomes disservice sen david 
pryor dark said in testimony prepared for a hearing today of 
the house ways and means subcommittee on social security 
pryor who chairs the special senate committee on aging 
complained of excessive busy signals and wrong or incomplete 
answers when people call the social security phone network the 
senator said he would introduce legislation today requiring social 
security to offer direct telephone access to its field offices and 
to make use of the 800line service optional 
there can be little doubt that the 800 line has seriously 
eroded the quality of the agencys service to the public he said 
the telephone network reached by dialing 18002345ssa is 
staffed from 7 am to 7 pm across the country and allows 
callers to take care of many matters without going into a social 
security office in many cities the tollfree number is the only 
social security number listed in the phone book 
but congressional critics complain people often are unable to 
get through on the tollfree lines and that many dont get full and 
accurate information when they do get through 
congressional caseworkers report people are frustrated when they 
get connected to someone at a distant location who doesnt 
understand local problems and because they usually cant talk to 
the same person if they call back 
on tuesday social security commissioner gwendolyn king defended 
the telephone network as a success story but acknowledged that 
callers too often get busy signals 
the telephone network which went nationwide last october was 
expected to handle about 250000 calls a day but more than 15 
million people try to get through on peak days and many of them 
call between 10 am and 2 pm she said 
the 800number is the biggest success story weve had mrs 
king said at a press briefing we just have too a big a success 
on our hands the trick is how to manage it so that it works 
better 
mrs king said the agency is preparing television and newspaper 
public service announcements that encourage people to have 
breakfast with social security by calling between 7 am and 9 
am when the phone lines are less busy 
mrs king said a new study by the inspector generals office of 
the department of health and human services found that 67 percent 
of those who used the tollfree line said they would use the 
telephone again to do business with social security up from 53 
percent in 1984 
eightytwo percent of those who used the 800 number reported the 
service was good or very good she said 
what we are finding is that when people do get through they 
find the service is courteous theyre very happy with the 
information they received she said 
in january traditionally a busy month for the agency an 
estimated 52 percent of calls to social securitys 800 number were 
met with busy signals compared with 14 percent in december 51 
percent in november and 30 percent in october mrs king said her 
goal is to reduce the busy rate on peak days to 35 percent by the 
end of the year 
the busy rates are a lot higher than we or anyone would like 
to have them on those peak days she said

recent articles in science journals that 
claim asbestos is not as dangerous as once believed should be met 
with skepticism by the public a group of scientists said 
articles in the past year in such publications as the new 
england journal of medicine and science magazine and a harvard 
university symposium played down the risks associated with 
asbestos panelists at the national asbestos conference said 
tuesday 
warren friedman who coordinates the asbestos program at the 
us general services administration said there is ample evidence 
from recent studies that indicate asbestos exposure does pose 
health risks particularly longterm exposure more studies are 
needed he said 
you increase the duration of exposure youre going to 
increase the risk he said 
asbestos was used for years in buildings as a fire retardant and 
an insulator but research in the 1960s found that inhaling 
asbestos fibers increases the risk of developing lung cancer 
the fallout from that research helped create a 51 billion 
asbestos abatement industry to remove asbestos from schools and 
other buildings and to monitor its presence elsewhere 
at the very least its not yet time to say all is well 
said dale keyes a physicist with environmental sciences of phoenix 
richard kronenberg a researcher with the university of texas 
health science center at tyler noted that the asbestos articles 
published the past year in scientific magazines were written by 
reputable researchers but he said any conclusions are still 
uncertain 
current federal regulations do not require asbestos removal and 
most contractors do not routinely expose workers or the public to 
health hazards kronenberg said 
by and large its a very tightly regulated excellent 
industry he said

a procuban guerrilla group holding two 
americans captive says it will attack us interests in colombia 
and if the united states intervenes there will be an uprising 
like in vietnam and el salvador 
the national liberation army declared death to gringos 
president virgilio barco called an urgent meeting of the 
national security council 
earlier tuesday at barcos urging a federal court pardoned 35 
members of another guerrilla group the april 19 movement who 
were accused of taking part in the 1985 takeover of the palace of 
justice that claimed the lives of 95 people including 11 supreme 
court justices 
the national liberation army is one of six guerrilla groups in 
colombia and is under the command of manuel perez a former roman 
catholic priest 
it sent a letter to the families of two americans kidnapped last 
week by its guerrillas in the northwestern city of medellin 
according to colombian news reports 
the medellin daily el colombiano published the letter tuesday 
the letter was directed to the families of james donnelly a 
65yearold mechanical engineer from detroit and david kent a 
40yearold schoolteacher from indianapolis 
the guerrilla group said it abducted the two men feb 13 to 
protest president bushs visit to the port city of cartagena 
thursday to attend an antidrug summit 
we are inclined to give a lesson in respect to the government 
of the united states and if it intervenes in colombia there will 
be an uprising like in vietnam and el salvador the letter said 
our position will change only when north america suspends its 
ways of intervening and of military aggression in latin america 
news accounts read on the radio identified some of the us 
targets cited as occidental petroleum texaco and other us oil 
companies and enterprises 
the defense ministry estimates the group has about 2000 of the 
10000 guerrillas figured to be operating in colombia 
the national liberation army blew up an electrical tower shortly 
before midnight monday and blacked out most of cartagena the city 
of 530000 where bush met with presidents barco alan garcia of 
peru and jaime paz zamora of bolivia 
insurgents then attacked a police station and five neighborhood 
police command posts wounding five policemen a national police 
communique said 
also monday the guerrilla group set fire to equipment at a 
government oil drilling camp and fought two battles with police 
one police officer and two guerrillas were killed and one policeman 
wounded 
a police communique also said fabio gomez mayor of almaguer in 
southwest cauca state and colombian anthropologist jesus bolivar 
were kidnapped saturday in almaguer 
in the last 18 months the national liberation army has kidnapped 
16 mayors the guerrillas have been releasing the mayors after 
warning them to spend more money on projects for poor people 
the guerrilla group late monday freed an american priest 
francis amico ferrari 43 of rochester ny who was kidnapped 
thurday from his parish in the slums of the western city of cali 
the pardons given to guerrillas on tuesday are part of an 
attempt by the barco government to end three decades of rebel 
violence in which more than 75000 people have been killed 
in all five guerrilla groups have told the barco government 
they are interested in peace talks 
in another development gen miguel maza chief of colombias 
secret police said 10 shoulderfired surfacetoair missiles 
seized monday from drug traffickers were to have been used to 
attack the bogota international airport and other major government 
installations 
a major drug cartel is based in medellin 
it has waged war against the government the last six months 
because of the barco administrations antidrug crackdown which 
includes extraditing suspected drug traffickers to face charges in 
the united states

the walls of 92yearold luella wilsons 
home are covered with the treasures of a lifetime 
trophies from the hunting expeditions of her younger years 
moose and coyotes hang on the walls and her rooms are cluttered 
with sentimental bricabrac 
now for the first time in three years wilson is safe in the 
knowledge that her home and 80acre property will be hers for the 
rest of her life she agreed to a court settlement that lets her 
keep both 
seated at the kitchen table tuesday afternoon surrounded by 
family and friends and sipping a celebratory shot of whiskey 
wilson looked markedly healthier and happier than she had just 
hours earlier seated in a wheelchair at the start of the liability 
trial 
the settlement reached during the noon hour on the first day of 
the trial in effect overturns a jury verdict in 1987 that wilson 
had to give up her home and life savings valued at 950000 
certainly i am relieved said wilson i dont feel so 
damn good i cant walk but i did win 
the 1987 jury had found her liable for severe injuries suffered 
by mark vince who had been riding in a car driven by wilsons 
great nephew in a 1984 accident 
wilson had loaned her great nephew willard stuart the money to 
buy the car and jurors felt she should have known stuart lacked a 
drivers license 
wilson learned of the settlement at home in a telephone call 
from her lawyer terms of the settlement were not disclosed wilson 
said she thought her insurance company vermont mutual was picking 
up her share of the settlement tab 
but an attorney for vermont mutual richard bowen denied that 
scenario bowen who attended the tuesday trial said the company 
and wilson had settled a separate suit but he would not disclose 
the terms of that settlement 
in opening arguments tuesday morning wilsons attorney 
frederick harlow told jurors vince not wilson must bear the blame 
for the fact he is mostly paralyzed and has lost a leg 
mr vince knew the designated driver was drinking beers 
having some marijuana mr vince knew that harlow told jurors 
on monday wilson rejected settlement offers that she leave her 
home and assets to vince upon her death my husband harry would 
roll over in his grave if i ever did that she said 
she said tuesday that she would not have to leave the farm to 
vince after her death under the approved settlement 
rolf sternberg one of vinces lawyers had argued that wilson 
the car dealership and the car salesman were negligent in loaning 
stuart money and selling him a car knowing he did not have a 
license and was not competent to drive 
mrs wilson had no reason to consider her nephew an unsafe 
driver someone she should not lend money to harlow countered 
stuart said he had lived with wilson for a short time and had 
served as her driver during that time even though he didnt have a 
license 
shortly after he bought the car in 1984 stuart drove it off a 
bridge after drinking beer and black velvet whiskey and smoking 
marijuana with a group of young men including vince according to 
court records vince a backseat passenger was partially 
paralyzed as a result of the accident according to records he 
later had one leg amputated

mobs angered by a public 
transportation strike looted a dozen grocery stores and burned a 
truck a tv news program reported rockthrowing students battled 
police in caracas 
at least 50 people were reported arrested 
the disturbances tuesday in seven cities were among the worst 
since february 1989 when 300 people were killed and more than 
1000 injured in widespread rioting over an increase in bus fares 
in the cities of barcelona and puerto la cruz both about 120 
miles east of caracas at least 12 grocery stores where sacked 
before police fired tear gas to disperse the mobs radio caracas 
television said 
no casualties were reported during the violence but at least 30 
people were arrested in both cities the tv reported 
at least 20 students were arrested after a twohour battle with 
police in a square outside venezuelan central university in 
caracas witnesses said 
the students threw rocks and set a truck on fire students said 
minor disturbances broke out in merida cumana san cristobal 
barquisimeto and maracaibo police sources said 
many of the protesters were students angered by the strike and 
by the refusal of some bus lines whose to grant student discounts 
the strike left most cities with only partial public transportation 
the strike was called by unions protesting delays by the 
government in paying subsidies that allow discounts of up to 50 
percent over regular rates for students 
increases of 30 percent to 50 percent in public transport 
tariffs and price gouging by bus drivers set off the rioting in 
february 1989 the worst violence in venezuela in 31 years 
the nation of 18 million had been regarded as an island of 
tranquility in a region of increasing violence and political and 
economic instability 
the price increases were part of a government austerity program 
intended to halt the downward economic spiral that has gripped

one of his first awards and he treats it with more reverence 
that you might think 
costner who has starred in such films as bull durham no 
way out the untouchables and field of dreams received 
the traditional hasty pudding pot from the undergraduate theatrical 
group tuesday then fell right in with the college hijinks

happen as a result of acting costner quipped after donning a 
redsequinned bra with a baseball motif over his tuxedo he 
accepted kisses from men in drag before a whooping crowd of 300 
the theatrical group said some of costners lesser known roles 
caught its attention 
what first attracted our eye was the soulsearching in such 
films as night shift and sizzle beach usa joked sharon 
owyang a junior and one of the shows producers 
costner who lives with his wife and three children in la 
canada calif is the 24th recipient of the annual hasty pudding 
pot joining the ranks of such alumni as paul newman johnny

he played a dead man whose suicide brings together a group of old

the tokyo stock exchanges key index fell more than 
3 percent today in its third biggest singleday dive ever and worst 
since the worldwide stock market crash in october 1987 
traders blamed heavy computerguided selling by foreign 
brokerage firms for the decline and said there was no panicselling 
amid concerns about possible interest rate increases the index 
already had fallen a total of nearly 565 points on the previous two 
trading days 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues the most widely 
followed index on the exchange fell 116119 points or 315 
percent closing at 3573433 
it was the indexs sharpest decline since a plunge of 120323 
on oct 23 1987 following a roundtheworld stock market crash 
the largest singleday plunge in tokyo was 383648 points on oct 
20 1987 
the dollar meanwhile rose moderately against the yen 
analysts and dealers said todays abrupt drop was largely due to 
waves of computerguided selling by foreign brokerages in the last 
halfhour of trading the computers figure out when to buy or to 
sell to profit from price differences between shares changing hands 
immediately and those promised for delivery in the future 
with most investors on the sidelines the analysts said a lack 
of buy orders allowed the index to fall sharply they said market 
sentiment was not necessarily as pessimistic as the plunge 
indicated 
the market has been very quiet since the beginning of the 
year and it was even quieter today said keiichi nishida of 
kidder peabody securities then came a large volume of 
indexlinked program selling by foreign brokerage houses it is no 
wonder the index droped so sharply at least i can say todays 
sharp decline was not a result of panicselling 
volume traded on the first section of the exchange where most 
major shares are listed was estimated at 430 million shares up 
slightly from tuesdays 335 million shares 
analysts also attributed the markets weakness to widening 
speculation that the bank of japan would raise its official 
discount rate the interest it charges for loans to commercial 
banks higher interest rates tend to dampen stock investment 
there is general agreement in the market that the official 
discount rate is going to be raised but because of upcoming 
overseas travels by bank of japan gov yasushi mieno the timing 
of the increase is unclear said michio katsumata of nomura 
securities co so participants are worrying about when it will be 
raised and by how much 
robert alan feldman of salomon brothers added it appears the 
institutions have finally woken up to the fact that interest rates 
are up and will continue to be up 
a bank of japan spokesman said there is no change in the central 
banks stance that it will continue to study the impact of 
spiraling long and shortterm interest rates that have resulted 
from the december base rate increase 
the discount rate now stands at 425 percent after three 
increases last year many market participants had speculated the 
bank of japan might raise it after sundays parliamentary election 
in the currency market the dollar closed at 14515 yen up 057 
yen from tuesdays close of 14458 yen after opening at 14555 
yen it ranged between 14510 yen and 14560 yen 
currency dealers attributed the dollars strength to prevailing 
expectations in the market that us interest rates would remain at 
their current high level 
alan greenspan chairman of the us federal reserve board said 
in a us congressional hearing tuesday that the fed would not 
relax monetary policy any time soon 
a dealer at the bank of tokyo speaking on condition of 
anonymity added that japans weak bond market also contributed to 
weakening the yen

patrick henry mcmahon the wounded sailor whom 
john f kennedy towed to safety after a japanese warship crushed 
their pt boat during world war ii has died of natural causes he 
was 84 
mcmahon died sunday at an encinitas convalescent home in 
northern san diego county where he lived for the last 15 years 
he thought the world of president kennedy he called him 
skipper said mcmahons stepson william h kelly of pascagoula 
miss the president saved his life and any time somebody does 
that for you youre going to feel strongly about it 
nicknamed pappy he was the oldest member of the pt109 crew 
because he enlisted in the navy at age 37 though exempt because of 
his age mcmahon was determined to serve when his stepson then 19 
enlisted in the navy one day after the japanese bombed pearl harbor 
he felt if my son is in there i couldnt face him after the 
war if i was sitting around the house having a beer said kelly 
68 a submariner aboard the uss greenling during world war ii 
the wyanet ill native was assigned to pt109 as a machinists 
mate 1st class he served under kennedy then a 26yearold 
lieutenant junior grade and skipper of the patroltorpedo craft 
over the years mcmahon often told the story of the night of 
aug 2 1943 when the crew was patrolling blackett strait in the 
solomon islands a japanese destroyer burst out of the darkness and 
smashed through their boat slicing it in two and instantly killing 
two of the 13 crewmen 
mcmahon suffered burns on his face chest arms and legs and 
couldnt swim because of the pain kelly said so kennedy put him 
across his back and kept him there by clenching mcmahons 
lifejacket strap in his teeth 
other crew members clung to a plank from the sunken boat until 
the exhausted survivors reached plum pudding island four hours 
later 
dad was burnt so bad kelly said he thought he was 
holding kennedy up so he asked the president just leave me 
ill be all right by myself but of course he would not think of 
it 
finding little food and no drinking water on the island the 
group left four days later for olasana island requiring another 
swim of several hours kennedy again towed mcmahon 
a few days later with the help of island natives american 
forces rescued the pt109 survivors 
mcmahon recovered from his burns and was discharged from the 
navy in november 1945 
after the war mcmahon went to work for the us post office he 
started as as a letter carrier and eventually became postmaster in 
cathedral city near palm springs 
mcmahon moved to encinitas after his 1975 retirement he and 
kennedy stayed in touch after the war and through kennedys 
presidency kelly said 
i remember a couple of times when he was president and came 
out to palm springs the secret service would call dad and they 
would sit in the limo and talk for a few minutes he said the 
president would always ask him if there was anything he could do 
for him and my dad always said mr president youve done enough 
for me you saved my life 
mcmahon also is survived by his wife of 62 years rose a 
daughterinlaw merlene kelly and four grandsons

in the first major dent in international 
sanctions against south africa britain has defied the rest of the 
european community and will unilaterally lift a ban on new 
investment 
britains move tuesday following its failure to persuade other 
members of the 12nation community to follow suit underlined its 
reputation as a reluctant member of the european community 
the african national congress today accused britain of breaking 
its word on economic sanctions and said the action was part of a 
pattern by prime minister margaret thatcher of favoring south 
africas white minority government 
she has been quite prepared to be out of step with the rest of 
the world in her anxiety to accommodate the pretoria regime 
pallo jordan the ancs information chief said at the guerrilla 
groups headquarters in lusaka zambia 
irish foreign minister gerry collins accused britain of setting 
a dangerous precedent and added i would appeal to everyone 
here not to embark on such a course 
in contrast to the fallout over south africa the communitys 
foreign ministers displayed marked unanimity over the upheavals in 
eastern europe declaring that the western trade bloc sees itself 
as a mooring for a future european equilibrium 
they urged that the officials of 35nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe begin meeting by no later than 
july to set up an eastwest summit later this year 
assurances by foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west 
germany that a united germany would not seek to dominate europe and 
would respect existing frontiers appeared to soothe even the most 
wary including britain 
it was the most open discussion we have had among the twelve 
on german unification said british foreign secretary douglas 
hurd 
genscher however left open the question of polish demands for 
a treaty to enshrine polish territory onethird of which was part 
of germany before world war ii he said the issue could be 
considered in sixpower talks among the two germanies and the world 
war ii allied powers the united states the soviet union britain 
and france and in the conference on security and cooperation 
on south africa only portugal supported britains in arguing 
that an easing of sanctions was warranted by the lifting of some 
restrictions by south african president fw de klerk this month 
and the feb 11 release of black nationalist leader nelson mandela 
it is not enough to sit back and say thats encouraging 
lets see what you do next said hurd 
collins said the community view was that the reforms while 
welcome do not yet go far enough perhaps there is agreement 
that we could look at our policy again when the state of emergency 
is lifted and all political prisoners are released 
the community agreed to send a factfinding mission to south 
africa comprised of representatives from france ireland and italy 
hurd said the move would be interpreted as a signal of the twelve 
delaying rather than encouraging 
the new investment ban was one of a series of nonbinding 
measures the community agreed to in 1986 
britain has long opposed sanctions and now argues that its 
policy of seeking to encourage south africas whiteled government 
to move way from apartheid has helped push de klerk into reform 
most other countries say he has moved because of the pressure of 
sanctions and resistance by the black majority which is denied a 
vote in national affairs by apatheid 
mrs thatcher is already under attack for what critics say is 
compromising british influence internationally by being out of step 
on south africa and being hesitant about german unification 
hurd indicated tuesday that president bush supports the british 
view that de klerk deserves a response from the international 
community 
hurd said bush wrote to mrs thatcher on tuesday and said he is 
prevented by congress from lifting us sanctions 
he went on to say the steps we are taking are positive and 
added that he feels very strongly that when someone does what you 
are asking you should recognize that fact said hurd 
britain is the largest single foreign investor in south africa 
although several major british corporations and the londonbased 
barclays bank pulled out because of pressure from antiapartheid 
groups 
south africas biggest foreign trading partners are four 
european community nations britian west germany italy and 
france and the united states and japan

nelson mandela has attempted 
to calm fears among business leaders with an assurance the african 
national congress would not impose drastic economic changes if it 
takes control a newspaper said today 
mandela was quoted as saying the anc would consult business 
before making any major changes in the economy business leaders 
have been frightened by recent mandela statements backing the ancs 
plan to nationalize the economy 
this is an extremely important matter and in any democratic 
situation a free expression of opinion is absolutely vital i also 
expect compromise from both sides mandela was quoted as saying 
by business day 
a lawmaker of the liberal democratic party said today that the 
anc and the governing national party were moving too slowly and 
must accelerate efforts to bring about blackwhite dialogue on 
ending apartheid 
tony leon of the white opposition party said the ancs decision 
not to hold a congress on formulating policy until december was a 
mistake he told a meeting in durban that the anc and the 
government had to move more quickly 
whether or not the anc or the government anticipates events 
achieving their own head of steam is almost irrelevant to the fact 
that the country and its people are hardly likely to stand still 
while the various parties get their act together he said 
president fw de klerk released mandela on feb 11 after 
legalizing the anc and other antiapartheid groups de klerk says 
he wants negotiations on ending whiteminority rule and extending 
political power to blacks 
the ancs exiled leadership in zambia responded friday to de 
klerks initiative by announcing it would send delegates to meet 
with the president to try and clear the way for constitutional 
negotiations 
the anc wants release of all political prisoners and an end to 
the state of emergency before taking part in formal talks de klerk 
has said that political prisoners convicted of violent crimes 
cannot be released 
on tuesday britain defied the rest of the european community 
and said it will unilaterally lift a ban on new investment to south 
africa in recognition of de klerks latest moves 
mandela in the business day interview said the anc did not 
want to take any major action on the economy without consulting 
business leaders 
we are very keen not to do anything without proper discusssion 
with those interested and involved he said 
mandela had expressed support for anc plans for nationalization 
of mines and other key sectors of the economy the statements made 
after his release following 27 years in prison for taking up arms 
to fight whiteminority rule caused widespread fear in the 
whitedominated economy 
mandela 71 also said other nations must continue sanctions 
against south africa to force the end of apartheid what we set 
out to achieve we are far from achieving and there is nothing that 
has happened that has required us to review this decision

a suburban maryland teenager who was the 
object of a nationwide search for a bone marrow donor has died of 
leukemia 
joanne johnson 19 died monday evening at her home in silver 
spring he family announced tuesday she had been undergoing 
treatment at georgetown university hospital but doctors had told 
the family they had done all they could 
ms johnson was visited by the rev jesse jackson and singer 
dionne warwick during her hospitalization 
ms johnsons parents howard and sylvia johnson said they made 
the decision last friday to bring her home to die 
the young womans only chance for survival lay in a bone marrow 
transplant and no donor could be found in her immediate family 
her parents over the last six weeks had organized a grassroots 
campaign in an effort to find a matching bone marrow for their 
daughter 
they knew finding a donor of ms johnsons ethnic background was 
their best hope but black americans made up only a small fraction 
of people listed in national bone marrow registries 
the johnsons set up mass screening drives with the help of 
dozens of volunteers who worked out of their kitchen and were able 
to triple the number of blacks registered 
a nearperfect match was found for ms johnson last week but by 
then she was too weak to endure the procedure said her aunt

four cubans seeking to escape their 
homeland on rafts died in attempted crossings while five other 
refugees survived the dangerous trip across the florida straits 
the coast guard said 
two men died at sea and their bodies were thrown overboard by 
their companions a third disappeared overnight and the fourth was 
dead by the time he reached a florida keys hospital 
the cubans the latest of dozens this year who have tried the 
journey of more than 100 miles were in two groups sighted on rafts 
tuesday officials said 
the survivors brought to 66 the number of cubans who have 
successfully made the voyage since jan 1 the deaths were the 
first known fatalities this year 
last year 391 cubans made it safely across the florida straits 
its a hazardous trip very dangerous coast guard spokesman 
luis diaz said at this time of year the waters are much colder 
and exposure has to be a factor 
in the homemade rafts usually used the journey can take several 
days 
two cubans were taken off a 6footby3foot raft made of 
styrofoam pitched with tar about 11 miles east of this florida 
key diaz said 
one a teenage boy was dead on arrival at mariners hospital 
while the other man was in serious condition diaz said he 
reported that a third passenger was lost at sea overnight 
a second group of four cubans was picked up 28 miles east of 
here hanging onto an inner tube diaz said they told the coast 
guard that two companions died on the voyage and their bodies were

rise 
in addition with sundays japanese general election now out of 
the way many analysts are convinced it is only a matter of time 
before the countrys central bank raises its discount rate

amnesty international said today that 
communist vietnam is still convicting people in unfair trials 
cutting food rations for some prisoners and putting some in 
solitary confinement or shackles 
the londonbased human rights group said vietnam has undertaken 
major human rights reforms since pragmatists took over the 
communist party leadership in december 1986 but many of the 
measures have not yet been implemented 
new legislation provides for development of an independent 
judiciary and contains such principles as the presumption of 
innocence the right not to be detained without a court order the 
right to legal defense and to choose an independent lawyer said 
the report released today 
however many of the reforms intended to protect specific 
human rights have not been implemented and human rights violations 
continue it said 
many western governments and human rights groups have accused 
hanoi of widespread human rights violations since north vietnamese 
forces defeated the usbacked south vietnam government in april 
1975 
the government told an amnesty delegation that visited vietnam 
last may that it was committed to renovation in all fields and 
stressed the importance of the rule of law the report said 
a copy of the report vietnam renovation doi moi the law 
and human rights in the 1980s was received in bangkok doi moi 
is the vietnamese term for renovation 
the 66page study said reports of abuses of detainees suggest 
that these practices are still common and that measures to combat 
them are not yet adequate 
abusive treatment in reeducation camps includes the use of 
solitary confinment in combination with beatings the use of 
shackles or leg irons and the reduction of food rations it said 
the report welcomed the release of thousands of people under 
government amnesties in 1987 and 1988 including more than 1500 
political prisoners detained without charge or trial in 
reeducation camps since the end of the war 
it said hanoi has told amnesty it soon will free the remaining 
130 former south vietnam government and military personnel arrested 
just after the war 
but it added that hanoi has not said anything about the many 
political prisoners detained more recently who had no connection 
with the former government 
among prisoners of conscience convicted in unfair trials have 
been buddhist monks jesuit priests protestant pastors writers 
and others believed to have been convicted solely because they were 
critical of government policies it said 
the report said the 1989 criminal code procedure contains no 
provision for detention without trial and appears to make such 
detention for reeducation illegal but the norms of the procedure 
have not been comprehensively implemented it said 
amnesty also expressed concern over the broad definition of 
crimes against national security in the code and said this has 
been used to convict prisoners of conscience in unfair trials 
the report said prisoners of conscience include poet and writer 
nguyen chi thien who has spent more than half his life in 
detention he is believed still under detention since he was 
arrested for the third time in 1979 it said

an ultraorthodox jewish rabbi says east german 
communist officials have appealed for jewish investment in their 
crippled economy to help slow unification with financially powerful 
west germany 
the communist leaders also expressed disappointment that israel 
has not taken a strong stand against the prospect of german unity 
said rabbi zvi weinman who visited east berlin this month to find 
out how the states 5000 jews are faring 
during the private trip weinman met with several officials 
including gregor gysi chairman of the former communist party now 
called the party of democratic socialism and deputy premier lothar 
de maiziere 
israel and east germany do not have diplomatic ties 
weinman on tuesday quoted gysi as saying only massive foreign 
investment could slow down german reunification 
gysi appealed to jews around the world to invest in east 
germany he said he would give investors good conditions weinman 
said in a telephone interview from his jerusalem home 
west german chancellor helmut kohls government has rejected 
east germanys request for immediate aid of 9 billion saying aid 
would only be forthcoming when a new east german government takes 
over after march 18 elections 
during his feb 8 meeting with weinman gysi also said he was 
disappointed that israel has not come out against unification 
according to the rabbi 
since the gysiweinman meeting israeli foreign minister moshe 
arens has cautiously embraced unification saying there was no 
reason for jews to be concerned if a united germany was democratic 
and recognized its historic obligations to the jews 
arens statement caused a furor in israel with some government 
ministers demanding that he be rebuked prime minister yitzhak 
shamir has expressed concern about unification privately but has 
not taken a public stand opposing it 
israels leaders cannot afford to disrupt flourishing ties with 
west germany but dont want to alienate the many israelis whose 
relatives were among the 6 million jews killed in the holocaust 
weinman also quoted gysi as saying east germany would form a 
special police unit to monitor the activities of emerging neonazi 
and fascist groups 
until the ouster of hardliner communist leader erich honecker 
last year east germanys secret police known as the stasi had 
monitored rightwing groups but the hated stasi was dissolved 
after the old government was toppled

in the strategic northwestern district of sisophon from the 
guerrillas of the khmer peoples national liberation front the

gateway to sisophon 
the liberation front guerrillas seized the town in battambang 
province dec 5 as part of the stepped up guerrilla offensive 
about 250 government soldiers backed by four t54 tanks attacked 
positions about six miles from svay chek for five hours said ok 
serei sopheak a senior official of the liberation front 
he said the guerrillas lost no ground eleven government 
soldiers were killed and 24 captured while only six guerrillas were 
wounded he claimed 
a thai military officer said the fighting could be termed the 
start of a small counteroffensive 
in bangkok hun sen the premier of cambodias 
vietnameseinstalled government held talks over a lunch with 
guerrilla leader prince norodom sihanouk they then went into a 
second round at a thai government building 
a joint communique reaffirmed their agreement that a united 
nations presence at appropriate levels in cambodia is essential 
and should be encouraged it also said they wanted a supreme 
national body that would symbolize national unity but they gave 
no details 
the communique said the two leaders thoroughly discussed issues 
blocking a settlement and felt there is now a better 
understanding of the issues involved that may lead in the 
nottoodistant future to a convergence of views on how to settle 
the cambodian problem 
the thaisponsored talks pave the way for wider negotiations 
next week in jakarta indonesia said suvit yodmani a thai 
government spokesman 
the cambodians have been quarreling over the composition of an 
interim government that will manage the country before a proposed 
general election 
the thai newspaper the nation today quoted cambodian defense 
minister gen tea banh as saying the guerrillas have been receiving 
more and increasingly sophisticated military aid since vietnam

a decade of occupation 
these arms he said were coming from china and the united 
states and transported into the country by the thai military 
hun sen was to travel later to indonesia for talks starting 
monday with guerrilla leaders and also involving vietnam france 
indonesia and other nations

phnom penh authorities the liberation front sihanouks group and 
the third guerrilla force the khmer rouge 
hun sen will not have anything to do with the khmer rouge which 
killed hundreds of thousands of people during its 19751978 rule 
the jakarta talks are expected to focus on an australian proposal 
for setting up a un interim administration before an election 
sihanouk will not attend the jakarta talks and instead plans to 
go northwestern cambodia friday to end a decade of lavish living in 
exile and reside in a bamboo hut in liberated areas of his 
homeland his spokesman said

john poindexter says former president reagans 
testimony is favorable to his case but the former national 
security adviser wants to delay its release until after a jury is 
sworn in for his irancontra trial 
twelve news organizations on tuesday suggested in a court filing 
that the videotape and transcripts of reagans testimony friday and 
saturday in los angeles be made available as soon as possible 
irancontra prosecutors told us district court judge harold 
greene who is presiding in the case involving poindexter that 
they have no objections to releasing the videotapes and 
transcripts of reagans deposition now 
but reagans lawyers filed court papers asking that the tapes be 
withheld until the end of the trial 
poindexters lawyers maintained in court papers that reagans 
testimony is favorable to the defense but the former president 
did not support poindexter in connection with key portions of 
allegedly false letters which poindexter sent to congress in 1986 
according to sources familiar with reagans testimony who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
poindexters letters embraced the white houses denials the 
previous year that national security council aide oliver north was 
raising money or providing military advice to the contras 
in his initial answers about the letters reagan focused on 
portions which stated the nsc staff was complying with the spirit 
and the letter of the boland amendment barring us intelligence 
agencies from providing military aid to the contras 
reagan in his deposition in los angeles supported those 
sections of the letters the expresident has said publicly he did 
not regard the nsc as being subject to the restrictions of the 
boland amendment 
however under crossexamination by irancontra prosecutor dan 
webb reagans attention was drawn to other statements in 
poindexters letters referring to the earlier information provided 
to congress that information included the denials that north was 
fundraising or supplying military advice 
reagan agreed with webb he didnt recall seeing those earlier 
responses at the time poindexters letters were sent to congress 
according to the sources the earlier responses led to a guilty 
plea by exnational security adviser robert mcfarlane to 
misdemeanor charges of withholding information from congress 
poindexters lawyers maintained in court papers that publicizing 
reagans testimony now would have an incalculable impact on 
prospective jurors 
disclosing reagans testimony prior to the march 5 trial date 
could result in irancontra prosecutors rejecting prospective 
jurors who otherwise would be favorable to the defense lawyers for 
reagans former national security adviser said 
they also said the testimony should be made public only after 
the jury in this case has been sworn and instructed regarding trial 
publicity 
alternatively poindexter asked that the media before the trial 
be provided only with a transcript of reagans testimony and that 
access to the videotape be deferred until the jury is sworn in 
in their own filing reagans lawyers asked that copies of the 
tape not be disseminated until the end of the trial and that 
public access to reagans testimony be limited to reviewing the 
videotape at a location under control of the court 
any earlier distribution of copies of the tape goes far beyond 
the requirements of the first amendment and may damage irreparably 
the rights of the defendant and the former president the former 
presidents lawyers argued 
the news organizations told greene that cable news network inc 
would act as pool representative for distribution of copies of the 
videotape to the news media 
in addition the news organizations suggested transcripts 
should be released at the same time as the videotape through a 
commercial copying center selected by the news media

an egyptian cabinet minister said in an 
interview published today that israels prime minister is blocking 
middle east peace efforts and creating a climate that leads to 
terror attacks 
butros ghali state minister for foreign affairs charged that 
yitzhak shamir of israel is the sole impediment to current efforts 
to organize a peace dialogue in cairo between israelis and 
palestinians 
egypt initially proposed the dialogue last summer to discuss a 
plan shamir introduced in may for elections among palestinians in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
secretary of state james a baker iii became the prime sponsor 
of the dialogue concept by making it the centerpiece of a 
fivepoint proposal presented in october no talks have taken place 
the only obstacle so far has been israels reluctance to keep 
up with the peace tide and the insistence of the israeli prime 
minister to plant obstacles after obstacles to prevent the start of 
real movement toward peace ghali said in an interview with the 
stateowned weekly almussawar 
israels persistent refusal to talk with the plo despite the 
fact that it is the principal party qualified for the dialogue 
under a full mandate from the palestinian people shows a 
position that is not serious about peace he said 
israel considers the plo a terrorist group and shamir has 
sought assurances from washington that it will be excluded from all 
peace moves 
ghali blamed the absence of peace for terrorist acts such as a 
feb 4 attack on an egyptian tour bus in which nine israelis died 
he said the ambush was as much an aggression against egypt as 
an aggression against foreign nationals on our soil 
but if we look for the roots of such incidents be they in 
egypt or israel itself or london or paris we undoubtedly will find 
that the absence of peace remains a condition that spawns such 
incidents 
the bus attack on a desert road between cairo and the suez canal 
was the product of anxiety tension lack of confidence and 
despair that affect many parties because of continuing obstacles on 
the road to peace and continuing intransigence he said 
egyptian investigators say palestinian gunmen carried out the 
raid during which egyptians were ordered off the bus before two 
masked men opened fire with automatic weapons and tossed grenades 
ghali also criticized the united states for tightened us 
immigration rules that he said are resulting in thousands of soviet 
jews going to israel 
arabs fear that many of the immigrants will settle in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip although israeli government 
officials deny there is a policy of settling them in the occupied 
lands 
about 12000 soviet jews went to israel in 1989 but under 
liberalized soviet emigration policies 80000 to 100000 are 
expected this year more than 8000 already have arrived 
ghali said egypt cannot possibly interfere with the soviet 
unions liberalization of travel for its citizens all that 
interests us is that they not be settled in the occupied 
palestinian lands he said 
the united states bears a fundamental responsibility because 
its decision to limit the immigration of soviet jews opens the way 
for pressure on moscow to route emigration in israels direction 
he said

the skipper who commanded the exxon 
valdez before joseph hazelwood testified that exxon advised its 
captains to remain on the bridges of their ships during any 
hazardous passage 
michael stalzer who sailed the exxon valdez in 1987 read 
tuesday to jurors from a company manual that offered advice to 
captains on the officer configurations necessary for operating the 
hightech tanker 
what are the tanker captains general responsiblities asked 
assistant district attorney brent cole 
hes responsible for the safety of the ship the crew and the 
cargo said stalzer 
he then read the section dealing with hazards including weather 
or a voyage past rocks and shoals 
could ice be a hazard that presents a threat to a tanker the 
size of the exxon valdez cole asked 
if its sufficient in quantity yes stalzer said 
hazelwood has come under attack by the prosecution for leaving 
the bridge of his ship in control of the third mate 10 minutes 
before it grounded spilling 1092 million gallons of oil into 
prince william sound the march 24 disaster killed countless birds 
fish and wildlife and blackened hundreds of miles of rocky 
shoreline 
the 43yearold former skipper is charged with seconddegree 
criminal mischief a felony and three misdemeanors reckless 
endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent 
discharge of oil if convicted his maximum penalties could be 7 
years in prison plus 61000 in fines 
the ships third mate gregory cousins has blamed the ships 
helmsman for failing to follow steering commands that would have 
kept the ship off jagged bligh reef 
but stalzers testimony suggested that hazelwood should have 
been present on the bridge to direct the ship around chunks of ice 
in the shipping lanes outside the valdez narrows 
cole has said he probably will rest the prosecution case against 
hazelwood by weeks end 
another exxon employee william deppe at first appeared to 
support hazelwoods decision to let the third mate navigate through 
the sound 
one of the responsibilties a master has is to delegate a lot 
of responsibility to other people he said adding he would 
entrust the command to another if i had an officer i had 
confidence in to carry out commands 
but deppe later said i probably would have been on the bridge 
and not left it to the third mate 
deppe who holds a captains license and is assigned to a shore 
job with exxon took over the valdez after hazelwood left the ship 
to talk with investigators 
in other testimony tuesday two marine engineers said three 
backup systems built into the hightech tanker to prevent accidents 
were functioning perfectly when the tanker ran aground 
one of the engineers stanley andresen of sperry marine inc 
said the system which includes an optional autopilot is designed 
to be as simple as possible for helmsmen to operate 
jurors also were shown a videotape of the crippled exxon valdez 
stranded on bligh reef dan lawn who shot the footage explained 
the scene and pointed out the thick coating of black oil bubbling 
up around the ship

the bomb slaying of an undercover narcotics 
detective may be the result of a love triangle not a revenge 
bombing by drug dealers as was first suspected according to a 
police source 
a nassau police spokesman confirmed today that nassau county 
police officer robert horan is a suspect although no arrest has 
been made in the slaying 
a second source also involved in the investigation and who also 
spoke on condition of anonymity said tuesday that the victim 
suffolk county police officer dennis wustenhoff 41 allegedly was 
involved with horans wife a federal drug enforcement 
administration employee 
wustenhoff was killed thursday when a bomb exploded seconds 
after he got into an undercover police car parked in front of his 
home in patchogue on new yorks long island 
police at first thought drug dealers may have planted the bomb 
to frustrate a current investigation or avenge one of wustenhoffs 
previous cases 
the disclosure of the possible love triangle motive surfaced 
tuesday a day after wustenhoff was given a heros farewell in a 
funeral attended by more than 5000 officers from 50 police 
departments across the nation 
spokesmen for the suffolk county police and suffolk county 
district attorney james catterson refused to comment

bendel horan a 20year veteran was assigned to emergency 
services bureau for nassau county where officers receive bomb 
detonation and explosives training

helicopters spraying a controversial 
medfly pesticide face prosecution under a new city ordinance 
banning low flying helicopter formations at night 
realistically speaking we cant stop them said lt terry 
blumenthal who oversees city police helicopter operations we 
can only cite them afterward its going to be a tough situation 
at best 
if convicted pilots could face a 1000 fine and a year in 
jail he said 
the state is spraying 400 square miles of los angeles and orange 
counties with the pesticide malathion to wipe out the worst 
infestation of mediterranean fruit flies since 198182 
agriculture officials maintain the spraying is a safe and 
necessary step to prevent the medfly from harming the states 
multibilliondollar farm economy 
pasadenas governing board early today approved the citywide ban 
on nighttime helicopters formations below 700 feet emergency 
helicopters will not be affected 
rick cole a member of the citys board of directors said the 
law was necessary to get the attention of agriculture officials who 
have scheduled spraying tonight over a 53squaremile area despite 
objections from some of the municipalities encompassed 
we need to do what we can to flex our muscle cole said 
earlier tuesday the los angeles city council agreed to pursue 
lawsuits and administrative appeals aimed at halting spraying and 
to study malathions potential health risks 
this is going to be a tough case but its a case we have to 
fight said los angeles councilman joel wachs the public has a 
right and a demand to know if the government is leveling with 
them 
the city of burbank adopted a similar measure tuesday 
los angeles councilman michael woo called the spraying a 
blatant example of the urban population of this state being held 
hostage to the agricultural industry 
clark biggs spokesman for the california farm bureau said 
farmers sympathize with southern californians for having to live 
with the spraying but contended that wiping out the medfly is in 
everyones best interest 
the mediterranean fruit fly lays its eggs in more than 250 
varieties of fruits vegetables and nuts grown in california the 
crops are destroyed when the larvae hatch and growing maggots eat 
their way out

defense secretary dick cheney was treated 
to a demonstration of some of the us navys most sophisticated 
weaponry today as he witnessed a simulated sea and air battle 
aboard an aegis cruiser based in this port city 
cheney in japan on the last stop of his twoweek tour of asian 
nations hosting us forces watched four huge blue computerized 
screens aboard the uss bunker hill simulate an attack on the 
american aircraft carrier midway in the sea of japan 
got a mad mad mad at zero15 miles yelled one sailor as 
cheney observed the crew in the ships combat information center 
fend off a series of submarine and air missile attacks 
cheney watched the pretend battle in the darkened command center 
as the screens in front of him danced with spots and lines 
reflecting the positions of various soviet attack bombers and 
submarines as well as the us ships 
capt rodney rempt told cheney the ship was designed to 
simultaneously track a number of enemy ships planes and incoming 
missiles within a 280mile radius with its stateoftheart 
computerized radar and weapons systems 
we fire long before seeing the whites of their eyes 
asserted the ships motto inscribed on one of the computer screens 
another aegis cruiser the uss vincennes shot down an iran air 
jumbo jet over the persian gulf in july 1988 with the loss of 290 
lives after the ships crew mistook the airliner for an f14 
fighter plane 
we are capable of providing defense in all sorts of different 
realms for the midway battle group the captain told cheney 
the sophisticated cruiser is one of 10 ships homeported in 
yokosuka where some 7500 military personnel are based fulltime 
about 35 miles south of tokyo the port is the home of the navys 
7th fleet which cruises the waters from hawaii to the indian ocean 
the secretary also was escorted by the commander of the 7th 
fleet admiral henry h mauze 
cheney left the command center to chat with the 350 sailors and 
officers aboard the cruiser some of whom asked him about 
congressional moves to slash the defense budget and expressed 
concern over possible pay cuts and promotion difficulties 
if the cold war is over and they cut ships and carriers wont 
our deployments be extended asked one of the sailors 
cheney responded that his primary priority was to preserve pay 
and quality of life for the armed forces even if defense budgets 
are reduced 
wed rather shrink the size of the force to preserve the 
quality than get in the business of cutting pay and benefits 
cheney said we want to manage it so we dont do violence to the 
allvolunteer force that we have today 
cheney dines tonight with japanese defense minister juro 
matsumoto he meets thursday with highranking japanese officials 
when he is expected to discuss pentagon proposals for a 10 percent 
to 12 percent cutback in us troop strength in the pacific rim 
cheney is also seeking a sizable increase in japans 24 billion 
annual contribution to the 7 billion cost of basing americas

president mikhail s gorbachev said the soviet 
union has an inalienable right to guard against political or 
economic damage from a reunified germany and said europes postwar 
borders must be guaranteed 
in an interview published today in the communist party newspaper 
pravda gorbachev said he believes it is up to the germans to 
decide the nature and timing of unification 
but he said a united germany must respect europes current 
borders and that only the four victorious allies of world war ii 
can determine germanys final status 
emergence of a reunited germany as a powerful economic and 
military force in central europe has aroused concern particularly 
among the russians and poles who lost millions of people to nazi 
aggression and acquired territory after world war ii that had 
belonged to germany 
kremlin spokesman gennady i gerasimov said today that the 
soviet union supports polands desire to join talks with the allies 
and the two germanys on unification 
we must discuss this with other participants but we 
understand that poland has the right because poland suffered most 
during the war he told a news conference in the philippines 
progress toward reunification has accelerated in recent weeks 
premier hans modrow of east germany plagued by mass emigration and 
a crumbling economy asked on tuesday for immediate reunification 
talks under the formula worked out with the allies last week in 
ottawa 
but gorbachev cautioned no one has a right to ignore the 
negative potential formed in germanys past especially as it is 
impossible to fail to consider peoples memory of war of its 
horrors and losses therefore it is very important that germans 
deciding the question of unification should be aware of their 
responsibility 
this applies particularly to our country to the soviet 
people it has an inalienable right to expect and the possibility 
to exert efforts to ensure that our country should not sustain 
either moral or political or economic damage from german 
unification 
gorbachev said germans should decide the form and schedule of 
unification but emphasized that germany unity also concerns others 
and any encroachment upon the borders of other states must be 
ruled out 
gorbachev specifically mentioned polands western border west 
german chancellor helmut kohls failure to make a public pledge to 
respect that border prompted poland to request the role in talks on 
unification between the two germanys and the allies 
kohl speaking tuesday in east germany promised that peace 
will emanate from a reunified germany 
in paris adam michnik editor of polands most influential 
newspaper gazeta wyborcza said tuesday that kohl must openly 
declare that he recognizes the existing border if he wants 
credibility with his neighbors 
bronislaw geremek leader of the solidarity bloc in polands 
parliament said the only way to change the border is war 
the two were attending a conference on the future of eastern 
europe 
both germanys are bound by treaties to respect the frontier but 
a united country would not be and some conservatives in west 
germany have suggested reunification be sought within the 1937 
borders 
in 1937 onethird of what is now poland was german territory 
gorbachev spoke in the interview of the rights of nations to 
protect their interests and said i refer primarily to poland 
the inviolability of its postwar borders like the borders of other 
states must be guaranteed only an international legal act can 
provide such a guarantee 
speaking about a united germanys relationship with nato and the 
warsaw pact he said the alliances will have a role as a new 
european security system evolves and any disruption of the 
militarystrategic balance is unacceptable 
east germany is moscows most important military ally and about 
twothirds of the 575000 soviet troops in eastern europe are 
stationed there 
however moscow has agreed to a proposal set forth by president 
bush to cut its troops in eastern europe to 195000 and there is 
considerable disagreement among nato and warsaw pact members over 
whether a united germany will be neutral belong to the nato 
alliance or be split into two security zones

it was a con worthy of tom sawyer persuading 
30 people to pay up to 500 each for an unauthorized job painting 
stripes on elevatedtrain pillars 
but it was no freshfaced boy who allegedly pulled this con 
said police who arrested 63yearold vincent pannone of brooklyn 
on fraud and larceny charges tuesday he was later released 
pannone took 250 to 500 from at least 30 job seekers telling 
them it was a refundable fee for health insurance said edward 
barbini a spokesman for state attorney general robert abrams 
the painters never saw their money again and got little or no 
pay for painting hundreds of pillars with black and white stripes 
barbini said some worked as long as four months before giving up 
someone presumably a disgruntled worker firebombed pannones 
cadillac on jan 24 barbini said 
barbini said pannone placed newspaper advertisements claiming 
his show n tell contracting co had a painting contract with the 
transit authority and promising painters 9250 a day 
unlike the mark twain novel in which tom sawyer persuaded other 
youngsters to pay for the privilege of whitewashing his aunts 
fence the pillar painting was not authorized officials said 
the painting in a section of brooklyn where the city subway 
runs on elevated platforms did not meet transit authority 
specifications which require zebra stripes only at intersections 
said spokeswoman caren gardner 
also the paint covered only the lower sections of the pillars 
we do not paint just pillars when we paint we paint an entire 
structure gardner said 
authorities said pannone has an arrest record dating back to 
1957 when as a 30yearold clerk earning 62 a week he was 
convicted of pilfering 174000 from his employer the american 
express co 
if convicted of the fraud and larceny charges pannone could 
face a maximum penalty of four years in prison and 5000 in fines

a 12yearold girl who was the first 
heartliver transplant recipient returned to the operating room 
today because doctors feared she was bleeding internally a day 
after a second liver transplant 
stormie jones new liver was functioning but a drop in blood 
pressure tuesday night prompted doctors to reopen the incisions 
this morning said childrens hospital spokeswoman lynn mcmahon 
they really are not considering this any type of setback 
she said stormie is doing very well she is incredibly strong 
doctors estimated it would take several hours to determine if 
she was bleeding and to locate the source ms mcmahon said 
stormie had asked her doctors for a new liver in november after 
she began to have symptoms of liver inflamation her mother lois 
suzie purcell 33 said at a news conference 
stormie became especially ill two weeks ago suffering from 
weakness jaundice and itchiness 
doctors decided feb 13 that stormies liver should be replaced 
because of damage from hepatitis caused by an unknown virus in 
early january when she was hospitalized for treatment of an 
infection 
her family was notified monday that a suitable donor organ was 
available the hospital declined to release information about the 
donor 
the 10hour transplant operation began about 315 am tuesday 
nine hours after stormie and her mother arrived from their home in 
the fort worth texas suburb of white settlement 
stormie had no qualms about undergoing another major operation 
her parents said 
its kind of like poker you cant win if you dont play 
said stormies stepfather alan purcell we had no choice but to 
play the game 
monday night the girl spent her time asking why doctors and 
nurses seemed to be delaying preparations for surgery 
she was asking when are they going to get here when are 
they going to show up and i want my liver mrs purcell said 
dr andreas tzakis who led a sevenmember team of surgeons 
said the new liver seemed to start functioning right away he 
said tuesday that doctors expected no complications during 
stormies recovery because of her relatively good health 
the girls heart was not affected by the disease tzakis said 
her heart responded perfectly during the transplant he said 
stormie received a new heart and liver on feb 14 1984 to 
control levels of cholesterol 10 times higher than normal her 
cholesterol level has since decreased to nearly normal tzakis said 
starzl replaced the girls heart and liver with those of a 
4yearold girl who had died in a new york car accident 
the success rate of a second liver transplant is estimated at 65 
percent to 70 percent hospital officials said

would strike next and nabbed a suspect emerging from a bank after a 
holdup 
allen lorenzo mills 34 of capitol heights was charged with 
armed robbery and assault with intent to rob after he tried to 
leave a sovran bank branch tuesday 
police said a man who had become known as the bearded bank 
robber seemed to prefer sovran bank branches striking three 
times at one branch and once previously at the bladensburg branch 
that was held up tuesday 
police guessed the robber might return to the bladensburg branch 
because his robbery there had been among the most lucrative and 
set up a stakeout 
shortly after noon a man who resembled photographs obtained 
during other bank robberies entered the bank police said within 
seconds a special alarm in the bank alerted authorities that a 
robbery was in progress 
undercover officers met the man as he walked out the door and 
arrested him without incident police said 
weve had several banks under surveillance over the last two 
weeks but today this was the only bank we were watching said 
maj tony leo commander of the special operations division the 
officers figured he would come back to this branch sooner or later

an evangelist has been convicted of 
firstdegree murder in the starvation death of a 4yearold girl 
she was allegedly trying to exorcise of evil spirits 
mary nicholson 40 of pace showed no emotion when the verdict 
was read tuesday and refused to comment afterward 
darlene jackson the mother of kimberly mczinc had pleaded 
guilty last march to thirddegree murder and child abuse in her 
daughters beating and starvation death on feb 8 1988 
ms jackson 33 who is serving a sevenyear prison sentence 
told jurors last week that ms nicholson convinced her that 
kimberly was possessed by demonic spirits that could be exorcised 
only through strict diet and discipline she was the states key 
witness in ms nicholsons sevenday trial 
ms nicholson was also found guilty of aggravated child abuse 
santa rosa circuit judge george lowrey ordered a presentence 
investigation into the evangelist and said sentencing would be 
scheduled when it is completed 
assistant state attorney kim skievaski said earlier he would not 
seek the death penalty 
the only other penalty for a firstdegree murder conviction is 
life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years the 
aggravated child abuse conviction is punishable by up to life in 
prison 
i am glad to see someones paying for my daughters death 
said kimberlys father kenneth mczinc 
earlier tuesday skievaski told the jurors in his closing 
arguments that ms jackson was led like a cow with a ring through 
her nose to believe her child was possessed by evil spirits 
but defense attorney r glenn arnold argued that ms jackson a 
former schoolteacher was having religious visions long before she 
met ms nicholson and that her testimony about his clients 
participation in kimberlys death was just another dream or 
hallucination 
witnesses testified that kimberly weighed 28 pounds when she 
died a child her age and height should have weighed about 45 
pounds

thousands of sandinista supporters on 
foot or in cars trucks buses and wheelchairs began gathering 
today for president daniel ortegas final campaign rally 
bands of youths stayed up all night raising blackandred 
banners across two parade routes and crowded vehicles began 
arriving from out of town before dawn for this evenings rally 
alongside lake managua 
were here to flatten violeta said jorge luis garcia 
castana a sandinista army veteran who was almost totally blinded 
by mortar fragments in nicaraguas civil war 
he and other disabled veterans said they thought a vote for 
violeta barrios de chamorro was a vote for the ussupported 
contra rebels who left them crippled for life 
they were part of a group of about 250 disabled veterans 23 in 
wheelchairs who made a 17day 160mile trek from the honduran 
border under their own power 
meanwhile the secretarygeneral of the organization of american 
states joao baena soares arrived to head a contingent of more 
than 400 oas election observers 
we are convinced that on election day there will be 
tranquillity that will allow nicaraguans the free exercise of their 
right to vote said baena soares in an airport arrival statement 
election observers said the biggest danger of violence might 
come in small towns and rural areas where politics become part of 
local feuds or hatfieldmccoy situations as one put it 
the observers are important to both sides mrs chamorros 
united national opposition hopes they will enforce a fair vote 
while the sandinistas want to legitimize their government 
on tuesday mrs chamorro said she was certain of victory but 
could accept defeat and called on the ruling sandinistas to make 
the same guarantee 
we dont know if they have accepted the rules of the election 
game mrs chamorro told about 400 of her uno coalition workers 
sandinista campaign manager bayardo arce told reporters that 
ortega was willing to turn over the government in the 
hypothetical event of a loss 
three us officials just back from nicaragua predicted an upset 
victory for mrs chamorro 
if i were a betting man id go with the longshot i think 
shes going to upset him said rep gary ackerman dny who 
made the trip with reps stephen solarz dny and doug bosco 
dcalif 
the election is being held as part of a central american accord 
also designed to disband the ussupported contra rebels who have 
been trying to topple the sandinistas since 1981 
the voting pits the sandinistas against mrs chamorros uno a 
14party coalition and eight other opponents a president 
vicepresident 90member assembly and local officials will take 
office april 25 for a sixyear term 
arce said the sandinistas were optimistic the united states 
would change its hostile policy toward nicaragua if the sandinistas 
won an election certified as fair by international observers 
alfredo cesar one of mrs chamorros top advisers said ortega 
would have a chance to become a historical figure by becoming the 
first head of a revolutionary government in the americas to step 
down voluntarily 
we have lots of guys in latin america who refuse to hand over 
power said cesar in an interview with the associated press 
if he didnt hed be just one more little dictator but he 
has a chance to make history cesar said 
the sandinistas were generally seen as leading but the outcome 
was considered uncertain because so many nicaraguans were reluctant 
to tell strangers who they support 
managua was festooned with redandblack sandinista party 
banners and slogans and a redandblack hot air balloon floated 
over the city briefly 
youths toted sandinista backpacks only a few blue and white uno 
signs were visible 
but an undercurrent could be felt even at a sandinista reception 
for the international press 
one reporter asked for a drink that was renamed the nica 
libre after the sandinistas took power in 1979 and was coldly 
told its called a rumandcoke

rival christian forces today used a 
ceasefire to stockpile weapons and redeploy troops for their next 
battle while civilians fled their ruined neighborhoods for refuge 
in safer moslem areas 
samir geagea leader of the lebanese forces militia refused to 
give any concessions to gen michel aoun and said his fighters were 
ready for war 
a source close to geageas command said his militia had adopted 
a new military plan to block any attempt by aoun to storm its 
strongholds if the current ceasefire collapses 
if clashes break out anew it will be a tough crushing battle 
throughout the christian enclave the source said 
snipers killed one person and wounded five in various parts of 
the christian enclave today police said 
by police count the fight for the 310squaremile enclave has 
killed at least 673 people and wounded 1877 in addition to 
inflicting more than 750 million in damage the dead include 97 
soldiers killed since the confrontation broke out jan 30 
the fighting began when geagea refused aouns demand that he 
disband the lebanese forces the largest christian militia in 
lebanon 
geageas 6000strong militia has deployed about onethird of 
its fighters in east beirut the military source said they are to 
defend its urban strongholds and deny aoun access to the port 
through the streets of the ashrafiyeh district aoun lost the port 
in the early days of the fighting 
military analysts believe aoun must regain control of the port 
to ensure safe supply lines by sea before accepting any peace 
settlement 
the lebanese forces moved new heavy fire power into place in the 
kesrouan mountains to harass aouns back if he tries to move into 
the port area the source said 
the upgraded fire power includes about 120 truckmounted 
multibarreled rocket launchers brought out of weapons depots the 
launchers obtained from iraq more than a year ago can fire 40 
122mm shells a minute 
geageas men are outnumbered by aouns army at least 3to1 and 
hoped to counter his superiority with their upgraded weapons the 
source said 
lebanese forces militiamen with nearly 15 years experience in 
street battles are waiting for aouns army in the narrow alleys 
of ashrafiyeh which has become a huge garrison the source said 
the militia force defending the port ashrafiyeh and the 
military headquarters of karantina have been beefed up from 1200 
to 2000 men the source said 
the surrender of aouns troops saturday at adma an isolated 
pocket in kesrouan freed the militiamen for the new deployment 
the source said the bulk of the militias fighting force backed 
by tanks and armored personnel carriers was deployed along the 
southern and eastern edges of kesrouan province separated from 
aouns troops by a nomansland of just a few hundred yards 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations confirmed that both factions were bolstering their 
forces aouns army stockpiled ammunition especially tank cannon 
and howitzer rounds in depots in the metin mountains northeast of 
the capital 
meanwhile civilians continued to desert the christian enclave 
seeking refuge in the predominately moslem areas outside the 
enclave the christian communities dispersed throughout lebanon 
before the civil war have gradually consolidated in the enclave 
since 1975

storms have forced international 
transantarctica expedition members to remain in their tents for 
extended periods as they near the end of their 3600mile journey 
across the continent a spokeswoman said 
this is particularly frustrating as they get closer and closer 
to their goal and their thoughts begin to turn toward home 
spokeswoman jennifer gasperini said tuesday in a statement from the 
expeditions st paul office 
it is also worrisome for the team as they have only a twoday 
supply of dog food 
however rescuers with more supplies in a soviet truck are 
stationed about 40 miles ahead of the sixmember team and could 
turn back if necessary gasperini said 
the team led by minnesotan will steger and jeanlouis etienne of 
france has an estimated 221 miles to go in the sevenmonth ski and 
sleddog journey 
this expedition is crazy and we are crazy to have done it 
gasperini quoted team coleader jeanlouis etienne of france as 
saying 
over six days ending monday the team was able to travel just 56 
miles gasperini said it stayed friday and saturday at the 
abandoned soviet base of pioneerskaya the team traveled 26 miles 
sunday in temperatures as low as 53 degrees below zero with winds 
of 33 mph and zero visibility and it became tentbound monday 
gasperini said that as the team descends toward davis sea and 
the end of its trek the weather is expected to get worse the team 
also is entering the worst area for crevasses which are giant 
cracks and fissures

the supreme court today told a federal appeals 
court to restudy the case of a retarded texas man who killed a 
deputy sheriff in houston 11 years ago 
the justices unanimously sent john henry selvages case back to 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals to determine whether the 
constitutional claim he raises can be handled by a texas state 
court 
when the nations highest court agreed in october to hear 
selvages appeal it was expected to use the case to clarify the 
scope and retroactive effects of a decision announced last july 
in it the court allowed states to execute mentally retarded 
killers only if jurors were allowed to take a defendants mental 
condition into consideration 
selvage was convicted and sentenced to death for killing albert 
garza a harris county deputy sheriff during a july 30 1979 
robbery of a houston jewelry store 
his lawyers argue that his death sentence is unconstitutional 
because jurors did not consider his retardation 
the justices were to decide whether there was a legitimate cause 
for selvage not raising that issue at some earlier stage but in an 
unsigned opinion today they said the 5th circuit court should 
clarify whether selvages claim based on their july ruling 
could be made in the texas court of criminal appeals 
lawyers for selvage and the state disagree over whether his 
constitutional argument is procedurally barred in that state court 
the 5th circuit court is more familiar with texas law than 
we are and we therefore remand the case to it for 
determination of whether selvages claim is presently 
procedurally barred under texas law the courts brief opinion 
said 
the case is selvage vs collins 876700

the supreme court today upheld federal 
regulations aimed at saving the government time and money when it 
mistakenly overpays some social security recipients 
the justices voting 54 in a case from colorado said the rules 
are a reasonable interpretation of the social security act the 
court rejected arguments that needy recipients could suffer undue 
hardship 
the regulations apply to two social security programs old age 
survivors and disability insurance benefits and supplemental 
security income 
adopted by the department of health and human services the 
rules cover instances in which the government at different times 
overpays and underpays recipients 
the rules allow officials to balance the overpayments against 
underpayments arriving at a net amount that is owed either the 
government or the receipient 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals based in denver ruled in 
1988 that the regulations illegally may deprive needy recipients of 
the chance to keep overpayments 
the appeals court said federal law requires the government to 
abandon recovery of overpayments when a recipient is blameless or 
if returning the extra money would cause the recipient serious 
hardship 
but the bush administration said the appeals court misunderstood 
the way the rules work 
administration officials said the regulations would not deprive 
needy people of the opportunity eventually to keep the extra money 
government lawyers said the regulations would spare federal 
officials from paying out millions of extra dollars automatically 
and then going through an elaborate procedure to recover some of 
the money 
from 1981 to 1986 about 47 million people a year received too 
much or too little due to errors in the retirement and survivors 
insurance program alone federal officials said 
justice antonin scalia writing for the supreme court today 
said the rules are reasonable he was joined by chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices byron r white harry a blackmun 
and sandra day oconnor 
dissenting were justices john paul stevens william j brennan 
thurgood marshall and anthony m kennedy 
the case is sullivan vs everhart 881323

boston universitys acting president has 
criticized chelsea public schools superintendent for holding up 
south african activist nelson mandela as a role model for students 
according to a published report

westlings reaction and quite honestly very upset 
here was a timely teachable moment for young adolescents who

production of plutonium triggers for nuclear 
warheads at the rocky flats plant in colorado may not resume 
completely before late summer a senior energy department official 
said today 
production was suspended indefinitely late last year to allow 
egampg inc which runs the plant under an energy department 
contract to install new safety and management practices the plant 
is the only source of plutonium triggers and is considered a vital 
link in the us nuclear weapons production chain 
adm jm barr a top adviser to energy secretary james d 
watkins on nuclear arms production said no firm target date had 
been set for resuming production but that rocky flats was expected 
to be in full swing sometime between july and september 
watkins had said shortly after the shutdown that he hoped 
production could resume by february 
speaking to a reporter during a break in a meeting with a 
department advisory committee barr said watkins now hoped to get 
the first plutonium processing facility known as building 771 
back in operation by june at the latest five other buildings at 
the site near denver also are involved in plutonium processing 
barr told the advisory committee on nuclear facility safety 
which is monitoring efforts to get rocky flats back in operation 
that by early april he would offer a specific target date for full 
resumption of plutonium trigger production 
were afraid anything we would give you now would be wrong 
he told the panel 
rocky flats has been plagued by a variety of operating and waste 
handling problems in recent years last june the fbi raided the 
facility in search of evidence of criminal violations of laws 
governing the handling of radioactive waste rockwell international 
corp quit as rocky flats operator last september 
barr told the advisory committee that the top objective of 
egampgs overhaul of rocky flats operations is to improve the 
margin of safety he stressed however that there was no 
imminent danger to the public from rocky flats operations last fall 
dave van leuven egampgs associate general manager for defense 
production at rocky flats outlined for the committee the tasks to 
be completed before production resumes he said for example that 
more than 1000 engineering drawings of safety systems would be 
checked for accuracy about 150 of the drawings have been checked 
already he said and it will take another eight weeks to do the 
rest 
van leuven said the technical competence of about 1500 plant 
operators would be verified before production is resumed he did 
not say how many already have been tested but he said the failure 
rate so far was about 30 percent 
egampg a massachusettsbased private technology company runs 
several energy department nuclear facilities

legislators got their first look today at a draft 
of proposed constitutional changes that would strengthen the post 
of the presidency now held by mikhail s gorbachev 
vladimir tumanov an official at the institute of state and law 
in moscow who helped prepare the draft said copies were 
distributed to members of the supreme soviet the national 
legislature which held closed committee meetings today he said he 
had not seen the draft and could not give details 
gorbachev has appealed to the supreme soviet to approve his plan 
for a westernstyle presidential system 
the washington post reported today that copies of the proposed 
changes have circulated in the kremlin it said that the changes 
would among other things provide for the president to be elected 
to sixyear terms and give him veto power 
the new york times today also carried a story on the proposed 
changes it quoted legislators who have seen the draft as saying 
the plan would include creation of a strengthened presidency this 
spring and the immediate selection of the president by the national 
parliament 
sergei stankevich a progressive member of a parliamentary 
commission that considers draft laws submitted to the supreme 
soviet said the changes would give the soviet president most of 
the powers of his french and american counterparts without many of 
their constitutional limitations the post said 
however deputies from the northern baltic states are alarmed 
over provisions that impose severe restrictions on the rights of 
republics to secede and permit authorities to crack down on 
nationalist organizations 
i dont think this new legislation will be acceptable to 
anyone who believes in a constitutional system of checks and 
balances stankevich told the newspaper 
alexander yakovlev a key gorbachev aide said the presidential 
system was necessary to ensure the stable development of a 
democracy in the soviet union 
deputies who have read the proposed changes told the post the 
draft includes the following points 
a sixyear presidential term with the first president elected 
by the 2250seat congress of peoples deputies the parent body of 
the supreme soviet subsequent presidents would be elected by 
universal suffrage 
the times said the president would be elected to fiveyear term 
it said a nationwide direct vote would not be held the first time 
because the feeling is that the country now cannot afford the time 
required to plan such a vote 
the president would have the right to veto legislation adopted 
by the supreme soviet a presidential veto could be overridden by a 
majority in both houses of the supreme soviet 
the president could declare a state of emergency in any region 
without securing the consent of the relevant republic 
the president would have wide powers to rule by decree when the 
supreme soviet is not in session 
the president would have the right to cancel legislation 
adopted by the parliaments of constituent republics 
the times said the changes would give the parliament the right 
to conduct a vote of noconfidence in the presidents government 
and that if the president lost he could disband parliament and call 
new elections 
the post said the draft could be submitted by the end of this 
month or the beginning of march to the 542member supreme soviet 
the congress of peoples deputies the supreme state body would 
have to approve any constitutional changes

carlsbad nm currentargus on the drug summit 
while some still claim the futility of fighting a drug war 
contending we have already lost it others forge ahead however 
haltingly refusing to lie down and die 
the drug summit in cartagena colombia concluded with president 
bush admitting to the presidents of colombia peru and bolivia that 
the united states must do something to curb the demand without 
demand there would be no production and sales 
we were encouraged by that conclusion but we must see more 
tangible efforts made to convince the american public of the 
deadend road exemplified by drug use 
too little is being done either in terms of funds for 
education or in direct communication to show all our citizenry 
how terminal their drug use activities are

although many colombians found the additional security 
surrounding the fournation antidrug summit in cartagena an 
annoyance the colombians did a good job in looking after the 
safety of their president and the presidents of the united states 
peru and bolivia 
the significance of this meeting was mostly symbolic a 
courtship it was the chance for the presidents to come 
together to respectfully discuss a common problem if only from 
different perspectives 
put another way it was a meeting of cocasupplying nations and 
the leader of the hemispheres no 1 consumer of cocaine 
president bush said that an antidrug cartel was born that 
cartel is only as good as the commitment to it and the 
understanding of situations unique to each nation

the indianapolis star on a reunified germany 
the reunification of germany is only a matter of time 
west germany has the vigor to nurse the sick east back to 
economic health and put it on a sound course 
the question of keeping germany in nato is a stumbling block 
the soviets are not keen about the prospect 
but the stumbling block may not be insurmountable 
membership in nato could widen a reunified germanys ties with 
the western community and deepen mutual trust between germany and 
other members of the alliance 
if the current era of good feeling between the ussr and the 
western community continues and progresses into a phase of general 
demilitarization and disarmament nato could evolve eventually into 
a peacekeeping alliance in which even the soviet union and former 
warsaw pact members have votes

in his first campaign stop in east 
germany west german chancellor helmut kohl told cheering crowds 
that peace will emanate from a united nation and that his 
countrys social security system will protect them 
kohl was kicking off a conservative alliances campaign for east 
germanys march 18 elections the countrys first free vote after 
40 years of communist rule 
but west german politicians who themselves face the voters in 
december are increasingly using east germanys election campaign 
to promote themselves and their causes 
meanwhile east germanys deputy defense minister and chief of 
staff said today the two countries armed forces should merge and 
be deployed on the entire territory of a reunited germany 
every sovereign state has the right to defend its 
sovereignty manfred graetz told the east german newspaper junge 
welt there are also neutral states that have armed forces i 
believe that a future germany must be allowed this right 
graetz also rejected extending natos territory over what is now 
east germany but said he did not believe it could become a no 
mans land 
his remarks could further complicate discussions over the 
military role for a united germany east germany and the soviet 
union have insisted that the future state be neutral 
west germany and its western allies want the country to remain 
in nato the west german government has said no nato or german 
troops should be stationed in what is now east germany 
on tuesday most of the 90000 people who crowded in front of 
erfurts cathedral for kohls speech chanted helmut helmut 
and our chancellor many waved west german flags 
there are fears in east and west of a germany that would have 
80 million inhabitants and be a tremendous economic force 
kohl said 
he also observed that a reunited germany will have to live 
with its past with the horrors that were committed in the name of 
germany this century and noted fears that it could again threaten 
its neighbors 
i take these fears seriously peace will emanate from 
german soil he said germans have been seeking to assure their 
european neighbors and the world that a unified germany will not 
pose a military threat 
in moscow mikhail s gorbachev proposed an international treaty 
on germany reunification saying his country has an inalienable 
right to ensure that it does not sustain moral political or 
economic damage from a united germany 
in an interview published in the communist party newspaper 
pravda today gorbachev said a united germany must respect europes 
current borders and only the four victorious allies of world war ii 
can determine germanys final status 
both germanys are bound by treaties to respect their current 
frontiers but a united country would not be and some 
conservatives in west germany have suggested reunification be 
sought within the 1937 borders 
in 1937 onethird of what is now poland was german territory 
kohl said he would seek massive investment by west german firms 
and extend bonns social security safety net to offset the economic 
chaos caused by what he called 40 years of red dictatorship in 
east germany 
we have created in the federal republic west germany a 
social security system that is exemplary in europe kohl said 
we want this system for people in east germany as well 
specifically he promised east germans that they could draw the 
same unemployment benefits as west germans after reunificiation and 
said east germans would get adequate pensions 
retirees would also see the value of their savings protected 
kohl was campaigning for the alliance of germany which includes 
the east german branch of kohls christian democrats as well as the 
democratic awakening and the german social union parties 
the coalition which polls show running behind the social 
democratic party is one of the most outspoken champions of german 
unification 
kohl was repeatedly jeered by about 100 hecklers waving east 
german flags and several antikohl posters apparently printed by 
leftwing groups were pasted up in the city 
but cheering broke out for minutes after kohls hourlong speech 
forcing him to appear several times at an open window overlooking 
cathedral square 
nothing better could have happened retiree hans wagner said 
from the square

sudans military ruler alleged today that 
israel and cuba are giving military aid to southern sudanese rebels 
and that israeli experts are helping train the rebels 
israeli and rebel spokesmen denied knowing anything about an 
israeli presence among the rebels 
lt gen omar hassan elbashir who leads the military junta 
ruling sudan since a coup june 30 spoke at a news conference at 
the end of an official visit his third as head of state 
we have definite proof of the presence of israeli experts at 
rebel centers for training and operational planning and of military 
support reaching the rebel movement from israel he said 
he said his government has information that there have been 
human losses among israelis in some battle areas 
the sudanese leader gave no details but his main field 
commander in the south was quoted tuesday as saying that three 
israeli experts were reported wounded in fighting in the equatoria 
region 
equatoria is one of three southern regions wracked by civil war 
since renegade army col john garangs sudan peoples liberation 
army launched operations against the moslemdominated government in 
1983 the rebellion was to press demands for autonomy and economic 
reforms in the south inhabited mostly by christians or animists of 
african descent 
maj gen nasr eldin suliman the governments military 
commander in equatoria told the sudanese newspaper alinkaz 
alwatany that his command had received a report saying three 
israeli experts were wounded in a mine explosion while inspecting a 
rebel camp in equatoria 
in jerusalem israeli defense ministry spokesman dan weinreich 
said i dont know about such an accident and i dont know about 
israelis in southern sudan 
in addis ababa ethiopia a spokesman for the sudan peoples 
liberation army lam akol said there has not been a single 
israeli that has gone to the south or near the border between 
ethiopia and sudan 
akol said the rebel command has not contemplated or 
anticipated any form of assistance from israel and charged that 
sudanese government claims of involvement by the jewish state were 
intended to isolate us from the arab world 
in his news conference elbashir said the rebels sent very 
large numbers of young southerners to cuba for ideological 
indoctrination and military training they are there now and our 
information is that there is a school in cuba called the sudan 
school he added 
dominique cassiano a member of elbashirs junta told the 
newspaper alinkaz alwatani the rebels have 12000 men in cuba 
elbashir told reporters that he and president hosni mubarak of 
egypt discussed how to end the southern sudan rebellion peacefully 
they dealt with a potential egyptian role in peacemaking he said 
the rebels and the government held peace talks in addis ababa 
last august and in nairobi kenya in december both rounds were 
inconclusive 
the sudanese leader asked mubarak after the december meeting to 
try to organize a third round of talks in cairo president mobutu 
sese sekou of zaire also has been mediating

los angeles daily news on the us postal service 
the us postal service plans to slow its service as well as 
raise its rates currently 4 percent of letters scheduled for 
overnight delivery arrive late the new plan will increase that 
figure to 7 percent 
but postmaster general anthony m frank denied that this will 
amount to a degradation of service he said in a recent 
interview that what postal service customers will lose in 
timeliness will be offset by more important improvements in 
consistency and reliability 
thats another way of saying that if consumers lower their 
expectations far enough it will be easy for the postal service to 
reach its own 
the problem with the postal services plan is that it assumes a 
great public willingness to reduce standards thats a lot to 
assume along with a possible 20 percent rate increase next year

the hartford conn courant on military spending 
in the wake of defense secretary dick cheneys presentation of 
the military budget for the next fiscal year the big word in 
washington is strategy 
rep les aspin and sen sam nunn respective chairmen of the 
house and senate armed services committees are saying that the 
budget lacks an overall scheme 
nunn says that congress would be inclined to support a defense 
secretary who could show that his numbers are part of a longterm 
plan to redesign americas military capacity relative to a reduced 
soviet threat cheney admits he has no such plan 
no one in washington does 
the reason no one has a grand strategy is that no one saw the 
changes coming in the soviet union and eastern europe 
grand strategy emerges from bold choices so far there has been 
no perestroika in washington

the providence ri journalbulletin on nuclear arms control 
has anybody noticed that public concern about nuclear arms 
control has practically evaporated 
when president bush announced that plans to reduce nuclear 
chemical and conventional forces were going smoothly white house 
correspondents were curious only about troop levels in europe this 
subject has taken center stage in a way that once would have been 
inconceivable overshadowing the news of progress toward the start 
treaty 
the public has tuned the topic out the soviets dont seem 
very dangerous anymore and most of eastern europe has skipped out 
of the soviet orbit practically without a shot being fired 
that must mean something 
well let us hope it means that the west has actually won 
the cold war but if so the war had more than one loser 
organizations that called for nuclear disarmament are suffering the 
mortification of contradiction by the kremlin itself and now are 
finding it difficult to keep members and friends 
their counterparts at the other end of the ideological spectrum 
arent doing so well either but at least they have some pleasure 
of vindication

the philadelphia inquirer on cigarette marketing 
the last time poor rj reynolds lobbed an easy pitch over the 
plate louis w sullivan the secretary of health and human 
services knocked it outta here 
the secretary has been benched for some contests the white house 
does not want any part of for instance family planning but he 
has been a tiger on tobacco within 24 hours of blasting reynolds 
for planning to testmarket a cigarette called uptown in 
philadelphia the company dumped the test 
it does tend to mess up a testmarketing effort if the secretary 
of health and human services says your product is fostering a 
culture of cancer among the target group young blacks in 
this particular case 
sullivan knew it and reynolds knew it so that was that 
that brings us to the next inning in this business the fellas 
at reynolds are planning yet another limited rollout of a new 
product this time the test market is houston where the target is 
women aged 18 to 20 one of the few segments of the us market 
where smoking is still on the upswing 
well we could have told reynolds what would happen we 
suppose its silly to expect a company thats burying folks as 
often as reynolds is to fully appreciate the term decent 
interval 
but give the white house points for unleashing the secretary 
having hit a home run with his efforts to protect young blacks he 
is apt to rip the cover off given the chance to defend motherhood 
youd have thought the geniuses in the reynolds promotion 
department would have considered that

the milwaukee journal on baseball arbitration 
baseball owners have done to spring training what buster douglas 
did to mike tyson but while douglas boxing victory was not 
immediately recognized there is no doubt that spring training 
and the spirit of winterweary baseball fans has taken it on the 
chin eventually tyson got up off the floor maybe theres a way 
to revive spring training too 
the owners and players are sparring over what else money 
the main issue is the complex process by which disputes over player 
salaries are resolved because they couldnt reach an agreement 
with the players the owners have refused to allow spring training 
camps to open as a result february is even more bleak than usual 
baseball commissioner fay vincent is trying to mediate this 
dispute but his efforts seem as futile as they are wellintended 
this disagreement seems too tough to yield to ordinary negotiation 
the financial stakes are too large it is not unheard of for 
journeyman ballplayers to be paid 1 million a year and the 
differences are too wide 
it is time to submit this dispute to binding arbitration not 
only are the two sides deadlocked time is short unless this 
dispute ends by midmarch the regular major league baseball 
season set to begin in early april may have to be delayed that 
would cost real money and deprive baseballhungry fans of games 
they have waited a long winter to see 
because of the nature of this dispute the arbitrator would have 
to be a person of unquestioned ability such a person will not be 
found easily or quickly thats another reason that the search 
ought to start now

charleston w va daily mail on coal strike settlement 
the means of reaching the agreement were ugly but everyone in 
appalachia must be happy with the new contract between the united 
mine workers and the pittston co 
the contract seems to ba a model of negotiation the union got 
what it wanted most and company managers got what they wanted most 
for union members this means fully funded medical and pension 
benefits improved safety requirements singleemployer status and 
wage increases that over a threeyear period will be 15 cents an 
hour higher than the industry average 
for company managers this means flexibility in work schedules 
and a reduction in the amount of money it contributes to the 1950 
pension fund 
as for the general public this contract agreement means an end 
to the violence and the reopening of all public highways thats 
not much but thats about as well as innocent bystanders usually 
fare in these deals 
was it worth it pittstons profits fell 63 million last year 
to less than 4 million the 1700 strikers went without paychecks 
for 10 months losses they will never recoup west virginia lost 
whatever claim it had to being a safe place to do business the 
public footed the bill of sending troopers and us marshals to the 
coalfields 
but perhaps everyone has learned something and the hope is that 
future negotiations will be less violent and less costly both to 
the participants and the spectators

eight years after adolph coors co 
discovered waste solvents in two springs beneath its brewery 
public disclosure of the problem has led to a state and federal 
review 
we have no evidence to indicate there is a public health 
problem dr tom vernon executive director of the state health 
department said tuesday but officials said state and federal 
agencies would investigate how coors dealt with the problem and 
whether environmental laws were being met 
im confident that there were no levels of these chemicals in 
the beer coors brewing co president peter coors said 
the brewery which markets its beer as being made of pure rocky 
mountain spring water said it discovered in 1982 that the waste 
solvents had leaked from a corroded sewer pipe into the ground and 
reached two of coors 40 springs 
coors said the company immediately began pumping water from the 
springs to reduce the contamination level and removed the affected 
springs from its water collection system coors also rebuilt sewer 
lines and hired contractors to remove solvent traces from the soil 
an anonymous tipster told the state health department about the 
problem in june 1988 but it was not disclosed publicly until a 
recent report by kmghtv 
theodore halaby a denver lawyer hired by coors to conduct an 
independent investigation after the television report said the 
chemicals found in the groundwater including cancercausing 
tetrachloroethylene never exceeded limits suggested by the 
national academy of sciences there were no applicable federal or 
state standards for the substances at the time he said 
halaby said coors should have notified the health department 
when it learned of the problems 
vernon said the health department has asked coors to supply 
documentation of its efforts to correct the solvent leak he said 
the us food and drug administration would be consulted about 
coors claim that no beer was made with the contaminated water 
we commend coors for taking the initiative in beginning this 
investigation said vernon

for provocations against jews 
literaturnaya gazeta a literary weekly said moscow prosecutors 
are pursuing charges against pamyat of inciting national and 
racial hatred and strife according to the newspaper pamyat was 
charged because of a statement published in another newspaper 
calling for a campaign to dezionize the country

their relatives must not be allowed to defend dissertations to 
acquire knowledge and get academic titles to join the soviet 
communist party to be elected to local governing councils must 
not be appointed to leading party government and other posts 
the report called pamyat a chauvanistic group and praised the 
prosecutors office because it realized the danger and 
unlawfulness of such extremist actions 
many of the thousands of soviet jews emigrating to the west say 
they are doing so in part because of a reported rise in 
antisemitism the soviet press has responded to the reports 
recently by carrying statements from government agencies condemning 
people who fan interethnic strife and promising to investigate

rival forces exchanged sniper fire in the 
embattled christian enclave wednesday and stockpiled weapons and 
ammunition in case their latest ceasefire collapses 
despite the occasional crackle of snipers bullets scores of 
people abandoned their homes and sought refuge in safer moslem 
areas 
police said one person was killed and five people including a 
6yearold boy were wounded by sniper fire between samir geageas 
lebanese forces militia and gen michel aouns troops in east 
beirut and the northern suburbs 
a police spokesman said the intermittent exchanges continued all 
day despite the ceasefire which went into effect saturday in an 
effort to halt the intrachristian power struggle for control of 
the 310squaremile enclave 
it was the 12th ceasefire since fighting broke out jan 30 
geagea has refused aouns demand that he disband the lebanese 
forces the largest christian militia in lebanon 
by police count at least 673 people have been killed and 1877 
wounded in the worst intrachristian fight in lebanons nearly 
15yearold civil war aouns command said at least 97 soldiers 
have been killed 
a military source close to geageas command said the christian 
militia has a new plan to thwart expected efforts by aoun to storm 
through its isolated pockets of resistance in east beirut 
the plan aims at defending the militias main stronghold and 
powerbase in the christian hinterland of kesrouan north of beirut 
said the source who refused to be further identified 
it also outlines a major tankled attack by geageas men against 
the rear of aouns troops if the general tries to penetrate the 
militias stronghold in east beirut and retake beiruts port to 
secure maritime supply lines 
aoun lost the port in the early days of the fighting 
if clashes break out anew it will be a tough crushing battle 
throughout the christian enclave the source said 
about onethird of geageas 6000 militiamen were deployed in 
east beirut defending the citys harbor the adjoining hilltop 
district of ashrafiyeh and their war council headquarters at 
karantina the source said 
about 300 other militiamen have been deployed in the lebanese 
forces other beirut pocket of nabaa north of ashrafiyeh 
lebanese forces fighters with nearly 15 years experience in 
street battles are waiting for aouns army in the narrow alleys 
of ashrafiyeh which has become a huge garrison the source said 
the major part of geageas militia according to the source was 
entrenched along the eastern and southern flanks of the kesrouan 
province separated from aouns lines by a nomans land of just a 
few hundred yards 
the militia force in kesrouan is backed by sovietdesigned t54 
and t55 tanks a variety of armored personnel carriers and a dozen 
usmade m48 tanks gained from aouns 19000 troops in previous 
battles the source said 
he said geagea also has upgraded his firepower in kesrouan by 
120 truckmounted multibarreled rocket launchers brought out of 
weapons depots 
the sovietdesigned launchers capable of firing 40 projectiles

a fire inspector said amoco oil co 
officials failed to keep authorities informed about a refinery fire 
that killed two workers at a liquefied petroleum gas loading 
station 
amoco fire brigades controlled tuesdays fire effectively 
preventing the blaze from spreading to 500000 gallon petroleum 
storage tanks said hammond chief fire inspector james walsko 
but amoco failed to keep hammond and whiting officials informed 
establishing emergency headquarters separate from posts set up by 
the cities officials walsko said the firefighters decision to 
evacuate about 100 residents and plan for a greater emergency was 
made largely in an information blackout he said 
the city fire department learned of the blaze only when a 
firefighter saw smoke in the sky and an amoco official called the 
city environmental protection office walsko said 
amoco spokeswoman lisa houghton said the company called local 
authorities in whiting hammond and east chicago the communities 
adjacent to the refinery within minutes of learning about the fire 
amoco is willing to talk with police and fire officials about 
improving coordination she said we will seriously consider all 
of their suggestions she said 
she said tuesday that the fire broke out during the morning in a 
loading area about a mile from the main refinery building and a 
halfmile from the storage area the state fire marshals office 
city investigators and amoco are investigating its cause 
killed in the fire were delphin flores 40 of east chicago and 
rich misiolek 40 of crown point said lake county coroner dr 
daniel thomas three tanker truck drivers remained hospitalized in 
fair condition today 
the massive refinery stretches across sections of whiting and 
hammond in a heavily industrialized and populated corridor of 
northwest indiana 
the accident was the worst at the refinery since an october 1988 
explosion at an asphalt plant that killed three workers and 
seriously injured a fourth

symbolize unity but gave no details the statement said they 
discussed issues impeding a settlement and felt there is now a 
better understanding of the issues involved that may lead to a 
settlemnt 
international pressure has grown for a un role in cambodia to 
avoid a return to power by the khmer rouge whose brutal rule in 
the 1970s cost more than 1 million lives through execution 
starvation or death from disease vietnam invaded in december 1978

greater supplies of more sophisticated weapons since vietnames 
troops withdrew at the end of september 1979 
tea banh said they were being supplied by china and the united 
states via the thai military the paper reported 
he said the guerrillas had advanced less than 40 miles from the 
thai burder and we left several towns to the resistance forces 
because we believed they were not worth defending

redoubt volcano erupted with a plume of 
gritty volcanic ash again early today just hours after the coast 
guard ordered the shutdown of an oil terminal along the drift river 
because of volcanic hazards 
just after midnight the 10197foot peak spewed a cloud of 
abrasive ash that headed eastward toward the kenai peninsula 
moderate ashfall was reported in nikiski and north kenai 
redoubt volcano last erupted feb 15 sending a jet of ash and 
steam nearly seven miles high and scattering grit that led 
authorities to cancel classes for 2000 students 
the mountain was quiet for 25 years until a series of eruptions 
began in middecember disrupting air travel in and out of 
anchorage during the holidays ash clogged all four engines of a 
klm boeing 747 on dec 15 and the aircraft fell more than two 
miles before the engines could be restarted 
the coast guard order cited the threat to oil storage tanks 
posed by flooding after recent eruptions of the volcano said bill 
lamoreaux regional supervisor of the state department of 
environmental conservation volcanic activity can melt snow and ice 
on redoubt leading to flooding downstream on drift river 
previous eruptions have flooded the river sending water 
coursing through the terminal and creating the potential for an oil 
leak in cook inlet 
last weeks eruption partially flooded the containment area of 
one empty tank at the terminal and forced the evacuation of workers

drexel burnham lambert inc paid bonuses of 
between 300 million and 350 million in the weeks before its 
parent company filed for bankruptcy protection officials confirmed 
today 
a drexel spokesman said the payments were determined in december 
and were not made with any knowledge that the firm would go out of 
business drexels parent company filed for bankruptcy court 
protection from creditors last week 
we did what we believed we had to do competitively and it was 
within both the norms of what the longstanding practice had been at 
the firm and within the norms of the industry spokesman steven 
anreder said 
several published reports today said some individual bonuses at 
drexel exceeded 10 million 
yearend bonuses are standard practice on wall street although 
drexel has been known for paying huge bonuses 
anreder said the size of most of the bonuses was determined in 
december while others were committed to early in 1989 some 
bonuses were paid in late december and some in early january he 
said 
if youre not going to pay a competitive level youre not 
going to have your people anreder said 
there was no sense of foreboding here at all he said it 
was only in the last week and a half that things were difficult 
but even then no one thought the firm would go under 
drexels parent drexel burnham lambert group inc sought 
bankruptcy court protection after defaulting on 100 million in 
shortterm debt 
representatives of drexels creditors said they would examine 
the bonus payments to determine if they could be recovered as part 
of the chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 
creditors may face a hurdle in trying to recover any bonuses 
because drexels securities subsidiary which paid the bonuses 
wasnt covered by the parent companys bankruptcy filing

the government has arrested seven 
political opponents an opposition party said wednesday as 
protesting university students boycotted classes and armed soldiers 
patrolled the campus 
the clandestine ivorian peoples front said seven of its members 
were arrested between friday and monday apparently in connection 
with the distribution of leaflets urging the ouster of president 
felix houphouetboigny 
students also have demanded the downfall of the conservative 
leader but it was not clear whether the demonstrations were linked 
to the arrests 
in the past the government has accused the ivorian popular 
front and its leader laurent gbagbo of inciting student unrest 
in a statement wednesday gbagbo asked the people to mobilize 
for the conquest to win a multiparty state justice and dignity 
he challenged houphouetboignys democratic party the only 
legal political group in this west african nation to the only 
debate that matters today peaceful transition to democracy 
students interviewed wednesday said they were angered by 
continuing police harassment of opposition politicians but this 
is just one sign of the lack of freedom and lack of democracy that 
we are protesting said gregoire tape a law student and member 
of the yearold national ivorian commission for the defense of 
human rights 
soldiers with rifles roamed the campus in the luxury suburb of 
cocody and police watched a university residence in the poor suburb 
of yopougon three miles away 
between 200 and 300 students gathered on the main campus and 
soldiers did not interfere during a rowdy meeting to discuss 
strategy 
but in yopougon police ordered students to stop forming groups 
students said police blocked them from going to the main campus 
wednesday but there was no violence 
on monday night police and soldiers beat up students and 
stormed their dormitories after they set two cars ablaze 
on tuesday they fired tear gas to force demonstrators to 
disperse 
they also charged students at the main campus after the 
protesters stormed two buses and smashed their windows 
there has been no comment from the government about the 
demonstrations or the arrests although houphouetboigny was said 
to be chairing a weekly cabinet meeting wednesday where the events 
may be discussed 
students say they are protesting the opulent lifestyles of 
government leaders while the country struggles through a recession 
that has brought salary cuts unemployment and declining living 
standards 
the students dispersed peacefully later wednesday after 
presenting demands to toure bakary the university rector they 
requested a meeting with houphouetboigny an end to police and 
troop harassment and the dissolution of a student body that 
effectively is a youth league of the ruling party

france on wednesday ended a 14year 
ban on sales of nuclear energy to pakistan announcing a commercial 
venture that would set up a nuclear power plant in the country 
france pledges to authorize french industrial enterprises 
to make rapidly a technical and commercial offer for the sale of a 
nuclear power plant to pakistan president francois mitterrand 
told a news conference during a fourday visit 
mitterrand did not say how big the plant would be 
prime minister benazir bhutto said a frenchsupplied plant would 
be open to all international safeguards and monitoring teams 
pakistan however is not a signatory to the international 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty and refuses to sign it unless 
india does 
pakistan must convince washington each year that it does not 
have a nuclear weapon before washington frees millions of dollars 
in loans ms bhutto has often said pakistan does not have a 
nuclear weapon nor does it want to produce one 
pakistan is not trying to enter into a nuclear arms race 
she said again today adding that islamabad has pressed india to 
sign a regional nuclear weapons test ban india has refused 
mitterrands announcement only vaguely referred to a 14yearold 
dispute between pakistan and france over a promised sale of a 
nuclear reprocessing plant 
france reneged on the deal because of us pressure to drop the 
sale unless pakistan agreed to sign international nuclear treaties 
and open its nuclear facilities to international monitoring teams 
pakistan lodged a variety of complaints until a french 
arbitration board ruled in its favor and ordered paris to pay a 
fine no figure was ever mentioned but pakistani media have cited 
figures ranging from 250 million to 400 million

george volak had to dodge communist bullets 
when he escaped from czechoslovakia to austria more than two 
decades later he drove all night to witness a moment hed thought 
could never happen vaclav havels speech wednesday to congress 
i think hes a great man i hope he runs for reelection 
said volak of murfreesboro tenn he and his wife spent 11 hours 
on the road without even knowing if they would be able to see havel 
once they got to washington their risk paid off when sen albert 
gore jr dtenn was able to get them tickets 
havel the shy playwright who moved from prison to 
czechoslovakias presidential castle in a matter of months 
demonstrated to the volaks and hundreds of others in the packed 
house chamber why he has become his countrys beacon of democracy 
and hope 
in a speech unusual for its modesty metaphors and metaphysics 
havel noted that he had barely two months experience as president 
and felt more comfortable in the realm of philosophy but he went 
on to advise americas highest officeholders how to do their jobs 
we still dont know how to put morality ahead of politics 
science and economics havel told his audience of senators 
representatives cabinet members and diplomats he urged them to 
follow their consciences rather than act on behalf of my family 
my country my firm my success 
havel a small blond man dressed in a dark suit and bluestriped 
tie read his speech in czech from a written text eschewing the 
teleprompters that american politicians favor for the best 
television appearance 
he flashed the victory sign during a long vociferous welcome 
and was interrupted two dozen times for cheers and ovations most 
often during his calls for peace morality and a return to the 
ideals of lincoln and jefferson 
some house traditions were broken for the occasion czechoslovak 
officials accompanying havel brandished cameras and tape recorders 
usually forbidden on the house floor czechborn film director 
milos forman now a us citizen sat with them wearing a red 
turtleneck instead of the customary dress shirt and tie under his 
sport jacket 
seated in the last row of the gallery was tennis star martina 
navratilova now a us citizen as soon as havel spoke her native 
language she began wiping her eyes and nose with a handkerchief 
i started crying right away she said later i wish i could 
make speeches that good 
havel author of numerous plays and books punctuated his 
address with poetic images and metaphors his country he said had 
been pinned under a boulder by communism he said 
czechoslovakia poland and hungary were europes wayward 
children he called the worlds governing systems anonymous 
megamachinery and democracy he said is like the horizon 
one may approach it but it can never be fully attained 
volak 44 was among those who took to the streets during the 
prague spring of 1968 to protest the soviet presence in his 
country he escaped to austria soon after moving to canada and 
then the united states 
when i was crossing the border they were shooting at me he 
recalled while waiting for havels speech to begin volak worked as 
a construction architect and now owns a campground he said he and 
his wife visited czechoslovakia in december shortly after the 
velvet revolution that ended communist rule 
i couldnt believe it especially because it was so 
peaceful volak said i met president havel at that time 
except at that time he was not president he didnt even want to be 
president

a house subcommittee heard a chorus of 
complaints wednesday about social securitys new tollfree 
telephone network from critics who said it can take days to get 
through to operators who sometimes give bad information 
members of congress and congressional caseworkers told the house 
ways and means subcommittee on social security that frustrated 
constituents report they cannot get through on the tollfree 
800number and no longer can call their local social security 
offices directly 
its time now for social security to say we goofed up 
sen david pryor dark told the subcommittee this system is 
nuts 
the telephone network reached by dialing 18002345ssa is 
staffed from 7 am to 7 pm across the country and allows 
callers to take care of many matters without going into a social 
security office in most cities the tollfree number is the only 
social security number listed in the phone book 
in january traditionally a busy month an estimated 52 percent 
of calls to social securitys 800 number were met with busy 
signals compared with 14 percent in december 51 percent in 
november and 30 percent in october agency figures show the 
telephone network went nationwide last october 
i applaud efforts by the social security administration to 
improve productivity but these efforts must not come at the 
expense of service to the public said rep sander levin dmich 
the data and anecdotal evidence indicate that the 800 number 
was not a step forward 
sen john heinz rpa released a letter to social security 
commissioner gwendolyn king in which he said the problems go deeper 
than busy signals in that they reflect a distressing shift toward 
a technological form of service delivery to the detriment of 
personal contact in the local community 
geneva leasner of baltimore testified that her supplemental 
security income benefits were incorrectly cut off for three months 
after a social security operator failed to properly advise her on 
how to file a timely appeal 
i had to borrow money from friends just to keep my house 
she said 
a college professor from connecticut assigned her entire class 
to call the tollfree number for two days straight and no one got 
through said gerald martin a caseworker for rep barbara 
kennelly dconn 
several people in western north dakota who could not get through 
by phone became so frustrated that they drove more than 100 miles 
to the nearest social security office to get answers said gregory 
rohde an aide to rep byron dorgan dnd 
constituents complain about numerous transfers busy signals 
and having to listen ad nauseam to a recording that a 
representative will be available soon rohde testified 
mrs king admitted that the system is a lot less than 
perfect but said the program is being improved she maintainted 
that overall it enhances social securitys ability to serve the 
public 
with teleservice representatives answering incoming calls our 
field employees are able to devote greater uninterrupted time and 
attention to those who come through their office doors seeking 
personal assistance she said 
the phone network was expected to handle about 250000 calls a 
day but more than 15 million people try to get through on peak 
days she said operators now are instructed to provide the 
telephone number for local field offices to people who ask for it 
i am committed to an 800number system that delivers 
highquality courteous persontoperson service as an option and 
enhancement to the facetoface service local offices have provided 
for so many years she said

nasa today delayed the launch of the 
space shuttle atlantis secret military mission for at least 24 
hours because of the commanders health and weather conditions 
a brief statement said the commander navy capt john o 
creighton had developed an upper respiratory tract infection in 
addition the launch weather is not predicted to be favorable 
nasa said it would decide thursday whether to try the launch at 
the kennedy space center on friday 
the space agency said a cold front was expected to move through 
the area tonight bringing with it clouds rain and high winds at 
the expected early thursday launch time 
the weather forecast had improved during the day with the odds 
for launch increasing from 30 to 50 percent but that was not 
acceptable and shuttle managers decided to call off the flight in 
early afternoon before technicians began pumping half a million 
gallons of propellant into atlantis fuel tank 
officials had been anxious to launch atlantis on thursday 
because longrange forecasts call for even worse conditions friday 
and saturday 
early today a service structure which provides workers access 
to the space shuttle as it sits on the launch pad was rotated away 
from atlantis and parked to one side 
they wouldnt do that if they had a problem said nasa 
spokesman bruce buckingham 
atlantis astronauts took advantage of a slight break in the 
weather today to fly practice landings in the space shuttle 
training craft they spent the rest of he morning in briefings and 
went to bed at noon 
the early bedtime for the fivemember shuttle crew is designed 
to shift their sleep cycle to the rest schedule theyll follow in 
orbit 
in addition to creighton atlantis crew includes the pilot air 
force col john h casper and mission specialists marine lt col 
david c hilmers air force col richard m mullane and navy lt 
cmdr pierre j thuot 
because of atlantis classified military cargo nasa officials 
did not announce the precise launch time saying only that it would 
come between midnight and 4 am thursday 
the mission is the sixth of 34 shuttle flights to be dedicated 
to a classified military cargo 
once atlantis is in orbit communications to the space shuttle 
will be blacked out to the public until just an hour before the 
craft returns to earth the flight is expected to last four days 
according to sources atlantis payload is a 37300pound 500 
million spy satellite known by the code name afp731 
the device is said to be able to take highresolution 
reconnaissance photos and to listen in on military and diplomatic 
communications around the world 
placed into a high inclination orbit the spy satellite will 
pass over most of the soviet union including northern areas not 
previously probed by shuttlelaunched satellites this orbit may be 
important in verifying soviet compliance with disarmament 
agreements now being negotiated between the us and the soviet 
union 
the soviets have spy satellites of their own to assure us 
compliance

education secretary lauro f cavazos said 
wednesday he would continue supporting federally guaranteed loans 
for students in private vocational and technical schools despite 
their default rate of 37 percent 
i want to make it clear that in no way does the secretary of 
education advocate stepping away from support of guaranteed student 
loan programs for proprietary schools cavazos told a senate 
appropriations subcommittee 
cavazos added however that the administration was determined 
to crack down on institutions with high rates of default 
proprietary schools are privately owned institutions which teach 
trades such as electronics or auto repair 
overall counting loans for regular college attendance there 
were 19 million defaults in the guaranteed student loan program 
overall in 1989 and the projected number this year is 2 million 
cavazos affirmed that i am a very strong advocate of 
vocational and technical education he said we have excellent 
firstrate associate degree programs in junior colleges and 
there are also some very fine proprietary schools 
cavazos was testifying on president bushs eductional budget 
request of 25 billion up more than 500 million from the 1990 
budget he noted the federal contribution is about 6 percent of the 
nations total expenditure of 353 billion for the current school 
year 
he stressed state and local responsibilities for funding 
education saying the federal role has evolved into one of guidance 
and evaluation 
we have successfully changed the focus of the national debate 
on education from inputs to outputs from resources to results 
he said 
sen tom harkin diowa said the federal financial share just a 
decade ago was 9 percent and complained that the 
administrations rhetoric ignores the fact that the federal 
government is the major player in many critical areas of 
education 
harkin chairman of the education subcommittee said 
seventyfive percent of all the student aid available to college 
students in this country is derived from the federal government 
and in the area of rehabilitation services it closely approaches 
100 percent 
harkin and others criticized the budget proposal as well for 
relying on unrealistically low projected interest costs for the 
guaranteed loan program unfortunately almost all of the new 
initiatives are paid for by a dramatic reduction in guaranteed 
student loan costs which result from the administrations rosy 
interest projections harkin said 
cavazos said the lower interest rates combined with reductions 
in lower priority programs will provide 18 billion for programs

the militarys transportation chief 
acknowledged wednesday that the douglas c17 transport plane has 
soared 4 billion over budget while coming up 90 miles short of its 
specified range of 2400 miles 
gen hansford t johnson also told the senate armed services 
committee that production of the 210 air force planes now 
estimated to cost 41 billion is six months behind schedule with 
the first model now expected in june of next year 
the pentagon currently is reviewing whether to proceed with full 
production in light of the lessening soviet threat overseas and 
budget constraints at home 
the bush administration in its 292 billion defense budget for 
fiscal 1991 is asking for six c17 transport aircraft requests in 
later years include 12 planes in fiscal 1992 and 25 the following 
year 
members of the senate panel including its chairman sam nunn 
dga and conservative republican malcolm wallop of wyoming 
expressed concerns about the planes mounting cost and its range 
limitations 
i would like to see what can be done with the purchase of 
offtheshelf programs versus the amount of money that we might be 
able to spend on other military programs wallop told johnson 
the commander said the military uses commercial airplanes for 
carrying passengers and transporting cargo but those planes and 
the aging fleet of c141s cannot do the job of the c17 
i understand that but im saying that these airplanes are 
already in production and theyre not 37 billion away wallop 
said 
johnson said the 4 billion increase was triggered by 
modifications the congress and pentagon demanded in fiscal 1990 
stretchouts in the program and inflation 
the commander argued that the military is using all the 
commercial transport we believe we can 
we need the c17 for three reasons at least johnson said 
one is the overall capacity two we need a vehicle to 
deliver forward from the battle area third the c141 is 
becoming a very tired aircraft 
the current fleet includes 234 c141 aircraft which are about 
25 years old or three times as old as most commercial jets 
johnson said 
that comment prompted nunn to note that life of a plane is 
determined by its flying hours not its age 
on the range issue nunn noted that pentagon specifications call 
for the c17 to carry 167000 pounds a distance of 2400 nautical 
miles but the air force and the contractor douglas co agree 
that the plane cannot fly from dover air force base in delaware to 
the azores a major refueling base in the midatlantic a flight 
which is exactly that distance 
it seems to me thats a serious problem the senator said 
johnson conceded that the pentagon added new heavier equipment 
on the aircraft and if the air force used a typical type of fuel 
the plane would come up 78 nautical miles short or 90 statute 
miles 
but the commander said if a new higherenergy fuel is used the 
air force would go back to its original specifications 
youre saying you had unrealistic specifications then nunn 
said 
no sir johnson answered 
whats the purpose of the specifications if you dont intend 
to meet the specifications nunn interrupted youre basically 
saying the specifications werent needed you overspecified 
johnson said the specifications were part of the contract 
between the douglas co which is assembling the plane in long 
beach calif and the government and if the contractor fails to 
meet the arrangement it will cost them financially 
the commander also argued that the problems exist only on paper 
since the first plane wont be ready until june 1991 six months 
after the target date 
were confident that we can manage that weight to give us the 
specifications to meet the specifications but right now youre 
correct theyre 78 nautical miles short johnson said

israeli officials said wednesday that a us 
report alleging human rights violations in the occupied lands was 
unfair because it did not take into account the violence 
authorities face from palestinians 
col renaan gissin the armys deputy spokesman said any human 
rights abuses were in response to violent incidents related to the 
26monthold palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza strip 
i agree that in the process of this excruciating struggle 
there may be violations of human rights i disagree that there is 
an intentional policy of violating human rights in the territories 
or elsewhere gissin said 
moshe raviv the foreign ministrys deputy director general for 
information said i believe israel is receiving criticism 
without people understanding that our policy is a reactive policy 
reactive to violence 
the criticism in the report emanated from the necessary steps 
that the israeli defense forces must undertake in order to react to 
terror and violence he told a briefing on the annual us state 
department report on human rights 
the report released wednesday in washington expressed deep 
concern about the human rights situation in the occupied 
territories it said israeli soldiers often did not follow rules 
intended to protect lives and that many unjust killings by soldiers 
went unpunished 
the report noted that new rules allow soldiers to shoot directly 
at fleeing masked men even if they are unarmed after a warning 
shot has been fired in the air earlier soldiers could fire only 
if their lives were in danger or at a felony suspect 
raviv said israel has no problem in principle with the 
reliability of the report but at another point he said the 
report has been inundated by false claims false reports that 
sometimes cannot be verified 
gissin said the israeli army itself has trouble verifying facts 
on the weekly average of 250 violent incidents in the occupied 
territories 
he denied the reports allegations that 10 palestinians died of 
beatings in custody or while soldiers searched their homes gissin 
said the figure was four including two who died in custody 
according to an associated press count israeli soldiers or 
civilians have killed 658 palestinians since the uprising began in 
december 1987 
the reference to the beating deaths was in a section of the us 
report quoting allegations of torture gissin said in response 
there is no policy of torture 
the state department repeated past us criticisms on the 
demolition and sealing of homes of palestinians suspected of being 
active in the uprising 
soldiers have destroyed 268 palestinian homes and sealed 147 
others during the uprising according to the army 
two more homes were sealed wednesday the army announced both 
were in the west bank city of nablus and the residents were jailed 
on suspicion of distributing uprising leaflets and taking part in 
violent attacks on alleged collaborators the army said 
arab reporters said a total of 13 people lived in the two homes

president bush wrote british prime minister 
margaret thatcher a positive letter discussing negotiations 
between the south african government and the nations black 
majority but did not discuss her decision to lift sanctions 
against south africa the white house said wednesday 
britain has announced it will lift its ban on british investment 
in south africa and end its attempts to discourage britons from 
traveling there 
bush while indicating he is willing to review the us 
sanctions in light of positive moves by the white minority 
government of south african president fw de klerk has proposed 
no change in the sanctions 
on capitol hill meanwhile house democrats indicated they would 
press ahead with move to tighten the sanctions 
bushs letter last week to thatcher spoke approvingly of de 
klerks leadership and said the south african government was 
serious about negotiations with blacks white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater told reporters 
bush wrote of steps he has taken in hopes of ending racial 
violence in south africa such as telephoning de klerk and recently 
released political prisoner nelson mandela leader of the african 
national congress 
at the same time the president took the opportunity to state 
that the actions of the south african government do not yet fulfill 
the conditions required by us law to remove sanctions 
fitzwater said 
under the sanctions imposed by congress in 1986 south africa 
would have to fulfill several conditions before the united states 
would lift the sanctions among the conditions are the freeing of 
all political prisoners and the beginning of goodfaith 
negotiations between the government and blacks 
the president reiterated that once the criteria set by us 
law has been met he will consult with the congress on whether 
to remove the sanctions fitzwater said 
asked whether bush had encouraged the thatcher governments 
decision to end british sanctions fitzwater said of bushs letter 
the presidents response was positive in the sense of 
encouraging a move toward negotiations in south africa and taking 
those general steps that could be helpful he did not comment on 
any individual actions in that process 
asked specifically if bush in his letter approved of britains 
lifting of the ban on new investments fitzwater replied that bush 
was positive on the overall encouragement of progress in south 
africa 
britain has been criticized by its european community allies for 
its unilateral decision to ease sanctions against the pretoria 
government 
the ec contends that de klerks freeing of mandela and lifting 
of a ban on political opposition groups do not go far enough to 
warrant lifting sanctions 
on capitol hill walter fauntroy the nonvoting democratic 
delegate from the district of columbia said there is no guarantee 
that de klerk will bite the bullet and make fundamental changes 
unless pressure is maintained and intensified 
fauntroy chairman of a house banking subcommittee is pushing 
for the adoption of a measure to prevent banks from rescheduling 8 
billion in debt held by american banks 
antiapartheid activists in congress are upset that banks have 
allowed south africa to stretch out some of its debt repayment 
until 1993 the repayment is on loans made before 1985 
rodney wagner of morgan guaranty trust co in new york told a 
joint hearing of the banking subcommittee and a foreign affairs 
subcommittee that banks oppose apartheid 
but he said the proposed legislation is economically unfeasible 
because south africa doesnt have the money to repay 20 percent of 
its principle each year

a team of divers with an underwater 
video camera slipped into icy convict lake today to retrieve the 
bodies of six of seven people who died in the frigid waters 
the camera immediately located two bodies on the lake bottom at 
a depth of 117 feet said mono county sheriffs lt terry padilla 
divers were preparing to bring them to the surface 
the body of us forest service ranger clayton cutter 31 was 
recovered on tuesday but the bodies of three teens from a nearby 
camp for young offenders who fell through the ice and three of the 
adults who tried to rescue them were still missing in the lake

with surface air equipment that allows them to go deeper and stay 
down for up to 30 minutes was also equipped with a camera to 
search the lake bottom 
cutter fell into the water as he tried to aid the victims who 
were bobbing and thrashing in holes broken in the ice 
just watching those heads bobbing up and down was too much 
said chris baitx 31 chief of the long valley volunteer fire 
department we figured we should have waited for the rescue team 
but when people are bobbing up and down you know whats next 
the recovery could be hampered because the extreme cold may 
force the bodies to the bottom of the lake which is 140 feet deep 
at its deepest point said mono county sheriffcoroner ma 
strelneck jr 
twelve teenagers and two adults from camp oneal a residential 
facility for troubled youths had been on a holiday outing monday

camp counselors perished as they attempted to rescue the others 
for those watching from the shore horror turned to hysteria as 
the tragedy was compounded again and again 
it was a bad scene and it just kept getting worse baitx 
said 
baitx also slipped beneath the splintering sheets of ice while 
attempting to rescue the victims but he was pulled to safety he 
was hospitalized overnight 
i had to beat the ice out with my hands baitx said i was 
sure i was gone i was thinking of my wife and kids and are they 
going to be ok because im history

the water on his own and didnt require treatment 
a paramedic plunged through the ice when he tried to reach the 
teenagers and went down three times before a diver pulled him out 
he was hospitalized overnight 
the eastern sierra nevada ski resort community of 5000 
residents about 250 miles north of los angeles was stunned by the 
tragedy 
we are a closeknit community and this accident touched 
everyone any kind of tragedy like this has a tremendous effect 
on our town said town manager paul marangella 
the privately operated probation camp is for young people

the idled rocky flats weapons plant in 
colorado the sole supplier of plutonium triggers for us nuclear 
warheads is unlikely to resume full production until at least 
july a senior energy department official said wednesday 
the plant situated about 16 miles northwest of denver was 
closed indefinitely late last year for safety and management 
improvements 
production of plutonium triggers is vital to maintaining the 
nuclear weapons stockpile neither the energy department nor the 
pentagon has said how long rocky flats could remain out of service 
before the arms stockpile would be jeopardized the plant was 
closed for a few months in 1988 after a worker was contaminated by 
radioactivity 
energy secretary james d watkins had said shortly after the 
latest shutdown that he hoped rocky flats would resume production 
by february but the contractor that runs the facility says it 
needs more time to install new safety procedures and retrain 
workers 
adm jm barr the deputy assistant energy secretary for 
military application said wednesday that one of the key plutonium 
processing facilities known as building 771 could be ready to 
resume operation by the end of june 
barr speaking to a reporter during a break in a meeting with an 
energy department advisory committee said current plans called for 
the full resumption of rocky flats production sometime between july 
and september he stressed that this was a preliminary target that 
was subject to revision 
barr told the advisory committee on nuclear facility safety 
which is monitoring progress toward resuming operations that he 
would have a more specific target date very early in april 
were afraid anything we would give you now would be wrong 
he said 
barr stressed that the final decision to resume production 
rested with watkins who in recent weeks has pledged to subject the 
plant overhaul to a full review by independent observers 
rocky flats has been plagued by a variety of operating and 
wastehandling problems in recent years last june the fbi raided 
the facility in search of evidence of criminal violations of laws 
governing the handling of radioactive wastes 
rockwell international corp quit as rocky flats operator last 
september in a dispute with watkins over legal liability for 
environmental violations 
egampg a longtime weapons industry contractor based in wellesley 
mass officially took over rocky flats on jan 1 but has been 
working there since september 
barr told the advisory committee that the top objective of 
egampgs overhaul of operations is to improve the margin of 
safety he stressed however there was no imminent danger to the 
public from rocky flats operations last fall 
dave van leuven egampgs associate general manager for defense 
production at the facility outlined for the committee the tasks to 
be completed before production resumes 
he said for example that more than 1000 engineering drawings 
of safety systems would be checked for accuracy about 150 of the 
drawings have been checked so far he said and 14 were found to 
contain significant errors he said it would take another eight 
weeks to check the rest 
van leuven said the technical competence of about 1500 plant 
operators would be verified before production is resumed he did 
not say how many already have been tested but the failure rate so 
far was about 30 percent

worries over chemical contamination forced a recall 
of up to 2 million bottles of mineral water wednesday while 
authorities warned 160000 people in central and eastern france not 
to consume polluted tap water 
the moves came as a dispute began between environment and 
agriculture officials over widespread pollution of drinking water 
due to drought heavy use of nitratebased fertilizers and recent 
floods 
the societe generale des eaux minerales de vittel announced it 
would withdraw from sale an estimated 1 million to 2 million 
bottles of hepar mineral water to allay consumer worries some might 
be contaminated with traces of hydrocarbons of the alkane type 
the underground springwater is distributed and consumed almost 
exclusively in france director alain dorfner told the associated 
press the company also produces the popular vittel water for 
domestic and foreign consumption 
supplies of hepar were contaminated jan 1011 when water 
sitting in a tank awaiting bottling came into contact with a filter 
exposed to air polluted with alkane dorfner said 
alkanes are a class of hydocarbon compounds including methane 
or ethane they occur naturally in some types of petroleum 
the water was bottled and shipped to points in france in 
january dorfner said and later quietly withdrawn from sale after 
the company discovered the contamination 
but the global recall of perrier water after a us laboratory 
found traces of benzene in some samples put the spotlight on hepar 
casting doubts on the waters purity 
the water now on the shelves is pure but we want to avoid 
confusion in peoples minds dorfner said new bottles will be 
on the shelves in 15 days 
dorfner said he could not estimate the cost of the operation 
hepar represents 21 million of vittels annual profits of 316 
million dorfner said 
in the eastern city of belfort meanwhile health authorities 
warned citizens to either drink bottled water or to add chlorine to 
their drinking water after bacteria was found in taps wednesday 
about 100000 residents cleared shop shelves of chlorine and 
bottled water to last for a week the amount of time authorities 
estimate it will take to clean the citys water system 
tests are still being run on the bacteria which entered the 
regions wells and reservoirs during last weeks flooding in parts 
of france authorities said the bacteria causes stomach problems 
but is not lifeendangering 
a similar infestation struck over the weekend at chateauroux and 
delos in central france where 60000 people remained on bottled 
water wednesday as health officials ran tests on the bacteria 
concern over frances water supply entered the political arena 
tuesday when secretary of the state for the environment brice 
lalonde criticized farmers for dumping nitratebased fertilizers 
onto the soil that eventually wash into water systems 
lalonde estimated 800000 people regularly drink water above 
safe nitrate levels and called agriculture a black point in 
environmental protection 
high levels of nitrates are particularly bad in britanny parts 
of northern france and alsace the daily newspaper liberation 
reported serious drought last summer compounded the problem 
liberation said as farmers dug irrigation ditches and diverted 
streams to water their fields disrupting the environment 
agricultural representatives said lalondes remarks were 
offbase but admitted the drought prevented fertilizer from being 
absorbed properly by the soil 
the agriculture and environment ministries promised wednesday to 
work together with the 12nation european community to solve the 
problem of nitrate pollution 
elsewhere the president of the private water company lyonnaise 
des eaux jerome monod estimated that only 40 percent of the 
pollutants in urban tap water are cleared out by filtration plants 
in an interview with the newspaper francesoire monod said the 
price of tap water could double in the next 10 years if french 
consumers decide to make the investment to clean up their water 
this price will still be minimal if we compare it to mineral

defense secretary dick cheneys twoweek tour of 
the pacific rim was barely a day old when philippine president 
corazon aquino declared she wouldnt receive him during his visit 
to manila 
the snub was striking in light of the crucial air cover the us 
air force had provided in december to help her survive a coup 
attempt 
but cheney reacted with characteristic equanimity he fell 
asleep 
on the balmy sunday the spat became frontpage headline news in 
honolulu the defense secretary declined to talk with reporters 
about mrs aquino instead he sought some peace and quiet at a 
friends home and promptly dozed off while lounging on the lawn 
associates said 
he woke up when a light rain started to fall so he went inside 
and fell asleep again cheneys wife lynne woke him up hours 
later when it was time to go back to the hotel for dinner and 
when he got there he fell asleep again 
in an appearance before a military support group later in his 
visit cheney joked about the slight telling his audience his 
lengthy introduction lacked one title being corazon aquinos 
favorite defense secretary

cheneys visit to the hills above honolulu brought to mind 
shakespeares macbeth 
macbeth shall never vanquished be 
until great birnam wood to high dunsinane hill shall come 
against him 
such tactics ultimately fooled macbeth and the defense 
secretary learned firsthand theyve become part of the armys 25th 
infantry divisions commando training in hawaii 
as cheney was escorted into the lush forests to meet the young 
soldiertrainees there was no one to greet him 
that is until the shrubbery started to shake and crawl his way 
up from the ground arose about two dozen camouflaged soldiers 
with twigs leaves ferns and assorted lush greenery tied to their 
shoulders and backpacks their faces covered in green black and 
brown makeup 
cheney clearly was taken by the scene and eager to speak with 
the young warriors 
that is until a twostar general sat down next to him on a tree 
stump to explain their training supplemented by an overeager 
officer with a plastic coated flipchart 
cheney finally did get a chance to talk with the 
greeneryattired young men whod waited patiently for their general 
to finish his lecture 
the picture of the scene was later dubbed cheney talks to the 
trees

cheneys arrival at the airport in seoul got a fair amount of 
attention from the south korean press corps given that the issues 
he wanted to discuss us troop cuts and increased korean 
contributions to their support are hot topics 
as cheney took the microphone to offer his thanks for being 
received in seoul a south korean anchorman stood nearby and began 
to boom out a report on camera drowning out the secretarys 
remarks 
cheney plodded on and so did the television reporter 
eyebrows were raised 
the official south korean delegation stared blankly forward 
acting as if nothing were happening 
both men continued their korean and english commentary tangled 
in a jumbled mess 
finally the wife of an american diplomat in the greeting party 
elbowed a korean aide who in turn waited politely for the 
anchorman to draw a breath before he tugged at his arm and silenced 
the journalist

a judge wednesday gave the united mine 
workers 10 more days to find a way to persuade him to drop or 
reduce 64 million in fines against the union for its tactics 
during the pittston coal group strike 
circuit judge donald mcglothlin had set a thursday deadline for 
the umw and pittston to return to court after he rejected their 
joint request feb 12 to drop the fines 
mcglothlin last week called the unions offer of 10000 hours of 
community service an affront to this court because it would 
amount to about five hours of work for each striker 
union officials said they needed time to develop a new proposal 
because they were tied up arranging for about 2000 pittston 
employees and laidoff workers in virginia west virginia and 
kentucky to vote on a contract they ratified monday the 
ratification ended the nearly 11month strike 
the whole ratification process created a big burden of work 
and we had to deal with that umw spokesman gene carroll said 
umw vice president cecil roberts said he hoped the judge would 
soften his position now that the miners have agreed to go back to 
work but he said he did not know what union attorney swould 
propose to get the fines waived or reduced 
the union originally planned to hold up a vote on the contract 
until the legal action was disposed of but during the hearing 
before mcglothlin last week he lectured the union on trying to use 
judges as bargaining chips 
it was clear the judge was not going to be pressured 
roberts said 
the fines were imposed for violations of judges orders limiting 
picket line activity and prohibiting the disruption of pittstons 
operations about half of the fines were for violence aimed at 
company personnel and property 
mcglothlin also fined the union 5 million for taking over 
pittstons main coal processing plant in september for four days 
and several million dollars for using sitdown demonstrations and 
big bumpertobumper convoys of cars and trucks to block coal truck 
traffic

a movement to restore political pluralism 
has gripped this himalayan kingdom pitting its harvardeducated 
monarch against two banned political parties inspired by the 
changes sweeping eastern europe 
clashes between police and demonstrators who demand an end to a 
29yearold ban on political parties have killed at least 11 people 
this week in usually tranquil nepal where crime is rare and 
murders make frontpage news 
activists claim the government has arrested more than 1000 
people in its crackdown on the movement for restoration of 
multiparty democracy the government says 175 people have been 
arrested since the campaign was launched sunday for the third 
time in 11 years 
i think this time the government is shaken said a western 
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity they have realized 
that bullets and tough talk wont make the problem disappear 
leading the agitation are the banned coalition of leftwing 
parties and the nepali congress party which governed nepal during 
its only two years in history as a westernstyle democracy 
for the last 29 years we have faced atrocities said hari 
bol bhattarai a senior member of the congress party who has evaded 
arrest its time to get rid of the system bring in a fresh 
system 
bhattarai who spoke in a telephone interview from an 
undisclosed location said the movement would continue until the 
government gave in we have waited enough now we wont give up 
until our demands are fulfilled 
nepal has witnessed startling political events since the shah 
dynasty began its rule in the mid18th century after almost a 
century on the throne the shahs were reduced to titular heads by 
the ranas who established a parallel line of hereditary prime 
ministers 
in 1951 king tribhuvan of the shah dynasty and the nepali 
congress party overthrew the rana prime minister and established a 
democratic constitution under which the monarch and an elected 
government were to share power 
the countrys first general elections were not held until eight 
years later as tribhuvan and later his son king mahendra 
appeared loath to accept the role of a semititular head of state 
the congress party was voted to power in 1959 but mahendra 
dismissed its government two years later and banned all political 
parties accusing them of corruption and misleading the nation 
that ban still stands despite agitations and violence in 1979 
and 1985 the 1979 movement led to a historic national referendum 
the next year in which the people narrowly voted to retain nepals 
nonpartisan rashtriya panchayat or national assembly 
analysts say one reason the people voted for a partyless 
democracy was the assurance by king birendra mahendras son of 
greater political freedom and genuine representation in the 
assembly 
we thought we would have it good either way said debendra 
raj panday a political commentator but we remained where we 
were the palace still runs everything in this country 
the legislators are voted with the governments support in 
effect the prime minister is chosen by the king he said 
the government says the 1980 referendum remains valid and the 
will of the people will not be changed 
nepal follows the middle path chief government spokesman 
radhey shyam bista said we rejected the oneparty system of our 
northern neighbor china and the multiparty system of our southern 
neighbor india 
for us the monarchy is the only institution democracy can 
only grow with the cooperation of the monarch he said he 
credited 44yearold birendra a graduate in political science from 
harvard university with ushering in remarkable progress in 
nepal a mountainous kingdom of 18 million people and one of the 
poorest countries in the world 
according to government figures life expectancy has risen from 
38 years in 1960 to 47 at present about 70000 nepalese receive a 
university education 
still half the population lives in poverty with a per capita 
annual income of 150 and more than 70 percent of the population 
has no safe drinking water 
i trace all economic problems to the political process 
panday said its a feudal economy and there are little fiefdoms 
everywhere with no regard to the peoples needs 
economic problems apart the demonstrators tone appears to be 
getting more strident and they have increasingly aimed criticism 
at the king which is a punishable offense 
our king is trying to kill democracy said rishikesh shaha 
a former foreign minister who fell out with the palace and left 
for india on feb 7 saying he feared he would be arrested 
he is trying to put the clock back at a time when around 
the world the voice of freedom the voice of democracy is getting 
stronger and stronger shaha said in an interview in the indian 
capital new delhi 
you just cant talk about him you are required to worship 
him but the prodemocracy movement has gone very deep down into 
the hearts of the people shaha said 
there is no question of turning back

sweden will send radiation experts to a 
badly contaminated area in the soviet union to study the effects of 
the 1986 chernobyl nuclear power plant accident soviet scientists 
said wednesday 
the agreement was announced at the end of three days of talks by 
soviet finnish swedish and norwegian officials on international 
cooperation in the event of nuclear accidents 
pavel ramzaev of the institute of radiation hygiene in leningrad 
said the soviets hoped to gain a broader view of contamination 
problems 
our vast material and data from the affected areas is only a 
first step toward knowledge about the effects of the accident 
ramzaev said adding that the soviets were seeking new ways of 
thinking 
a swedish team will go this summer to an area in the russian 
republic several hundred miles northeast of chernobyl where 
radiation levels were far higher than expected 
we have a lot to learn about the medical effects on human 
life and how to measure and decontaminate agriculture land and the 
environment in general said jan olof snihs of swedens national 
institute of radiation protection 
the soviets said a conference in vienna starting friday will 
discuss the organization of an international research institute to 
be established at chernobyl 
the april 26 1986 explosion at the no 4 reactor of the 
fourunit nuclear power plant in the soviet ukraine was the worlds 
worst atomic accident 
the accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of 
northern and central europe leading to bans on foodstuffs from 
several countries the plant is 80 miles north of the ukraine 
capital of kiev 
two workers died immediately of burns they suffered in the 
explosion 28 died shortly after the accident from radiation 
exposure and one died of a heart attack while fighting the fire 
by 1989 officials said more than 250 people who had worked at the 
polant or who were involved in the postaccident cleanup had died 
of various causes not all of them necessarily traceable to 
radiation exposure

markus wolf the retired chief spy 
of east germany has taken refuge in the soviet union to avoid 
possible arrest at home in an arms export scandal a west german 
newspaper reported wednesday 
he lived in the soviet union for many years and once called it 
his second homeland wolf is believed to have had close ties to 
the kgb secret police 
the sueddeutsche zeitung said east german prosecutors believe 
wolf was involved in the illegal arms operation and may even have 
directed it 
east german authorities have said the the exports were handled 
by alexander schalckgolodkowski chief foreign trader for the 
ousted communist government 
he fled to west berlin when the operation was discovered in 
december and spent several days in jail but a judge said there 
were no grounds in west germany for holding schalckgolodkowski and 
released him in january 
wolf retired in february 1987 from the state security ministry 
where he was in charge of the espionage section and directed such 
agents as guenter guillaume whose unmasking led to the resignation 
of willy brandt as west german chancellor guillaume had been one 
of brandts closest aides 
the sueddeutsche zeitung said wolf was living with his 
halfsister in a villa near moscow and writing a book on east 
germany politics of recent years 
in its report made available to other news media before 
publication thursday the paper said he had offers for the book 
from two west german publishers 
east german tv carried the sueddeutsche zeitung report without 
comment 
the former spy turned to writing after retirement in the 
turmoil that brought down old guard communist party chief erich 
honecker in october he supported the type of political and 
economic reforms championed by mikhail s gorbachev the soviet 
president 
wolfs father friedrich was a prominent author and physician 
with communist convictions he fled when the nazis came to power in 
1933 and took his family to moscow where his son attended 
communist party schools 
when the younger wolf arrived in the soviet sector of occupied 
germany in 1945 he worked as a radio journalist 
later wolf returned to moscow as an east german diplomat he 
described the familys life in moscow during stalins rule in a 
book published after his retirement 
wolf joined the state security ministry in 1951 became 
espionage chief in 1957 and retired with the rank of general 
his career was said to have inspired spy novelist john le 
carres character karla a fictional soviet spymaster who finally 
is forced to defect to the west by an elaborate plot devised by 
british agent george smiley 
after decades of virtual invisibility wolf spoke at rallies in 
the early days of east germanys revolution and appeared in several 
discussions on east and west german tv 
there is an arrest warrant out for him in west germany because 
of his espionage activities

genetic experiments with ordinary pond scum 
show it may be an automatic dispenser of fertilizer in rice fields 
the agriculture department said wednesday 
but the departments agricultural research service said it may 
be another 15 years before rice growers are able to use the pond 
scum or bluegreen algae as a fertilizer source 
if the procedure can be developed the natural fertilizer 
dispensed by the special algae could have a significant effect on 
rice production around the world including many third world 
countries that rely on the crop as a food staple 
stephen albrecht a plant physiologist at the agencys 
laboratory in gainesville fla said greenhouse tests with the 
altered algae boosted rice production eightfold however he said 
it didnt do well in the field probably because the algae had not 
been adapted to field conditions 
normally pond algae produces just enough nutrientrich ammonia 
from nitrogen in the atmosphere to take care of its own needs the 
genetically engineered strains keeps producing as long as nearby 
plants need it 
when rice plants stop taking in ammonia the algae stops 
production before excess amounts spill over into the environment 
albrecht said the onandoff fertilizing system could mean less 
groundwater contamination tests showed that while rice with algae 
at its roots had some ammonia there was none in the environment 
if the algae can be adapted to rice fields albrecht said 
growers could grow algae alongside rice fields and flood it into 
the rice areas at irrigation time he said it would be cheaper and 
require less work than with commercial fertilizers

the soviet union has denied permission to 
four us congressmen who want to travel to lithuania for this 
weekends elections in the soviet baltic republic the legislators 
said wednesday 
the group led by rep richard durbin dill was selected by 
congress to observe the local elections saturday after an 
invitation was received from the lithuanian national movement 
sajudis 
other members of the party include reps christopher cox 
rcalif and john miller rwash and texas democrat bill 
sarpalius dtexas 
the group had hoped to pick up its visas at the soviet consulate 
in east berlin durbin said then catch an aeroflot flight to 
vilnius the lithuanian capital 
to our surprise we were greeted with a cable from the soviets 
sent at 11 oclock washington time last night advising us that we 
would not be allowed towitness the lithuanian elections durbin 
said we thought that things were on track and that the visas 
would be issued 
its very frustrating were running into the limits of 
glasnost apparently miller said 
asked if the soviets had specified reasons for the denial 
durbin said they were told they hadnt gone through the appropriate 
procedures 
but frankly that conflicts with the fact that other 
parliamentarians from canada and austria are presently in 
lithuania it appears that they have made some special ruling as 
the denial relates only to members of congress from the united 
states he said 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev said the 
congressmen had not been invited by any officially recognized 
groups and said their trip was not coordinated or discussed through 
diplomatic channels 
taking all these facts into account the congressmen were 
informed that their trip to the ussr at present would be 
incorrect he said 
this decision of course is in no connection with the 
personalities of the congressmen they are welcome in the ussr 
at any convenient date which could be mutually agreed upon 
durbin said the delegation would continue to press for 
permission to go to lithuania and would contact washington to 
rally some support to pressure the soviets 
we still have time to make it to lithuania before the election 
and we all consider that to be of the utmost importance durbin 
said 
lithuania latvia and estonia were independent states between 
world war i and 1940 when they were annexed by the soviet union 
the baltic republics are seeking to obtain a measure of 
independence from moscow and the elections saturday will test the 
strength of the nationalist movement in lithuania

federal safety officials investigating the 
crash of an avianca jetliner in new york issued emergency 
recommendations today aimed at clarifying how pilots should declare 
fuel emergencies 
seventythree people died when the fuelstarved airliner crashed 
in long island while on approach to kennedy international airport 
in new york 
the national transportation safety board urged the federal 
aviation administration to alert all air carriers with flights in 
the united states that their crews must be thoroughly 
knowledgeable about faa rules including specific phrases to be 
used when a plane is running out of fuel 
the board with three of its four members concurring also 
called on the faa to issue a general notice to air traffic 
controllers on the circumstances of the jan 25 crash of the 
colombian airliner and to emphasize the need for controllers to 
request clarification of unclear or ambiguous transmissions 
from airliners that may convey an emergency 
pilots of the flight from bogota and medellin colombia told 
controllers several times they were running out of fuel 
however they never declared a formal minimum fuel status or 
emergency fuel condition which would have alerted controllers 
to clear them for landing as quickly as possible ntsb members said 
the board said it was continuing investigation into the cause of 
the crash and has not concluded that any specific communication 
or coordination problems were causal to the accident 
the faa is not required to adopt recommendations by the ntsb an 
independent agency 
eightysix people survived the crash of the avianca boeing 707

a federal law aimed at creating new hiking and 
biking trails along unused rail lines was upheld wednesday by the 
supreme court 
the justices unanimously rejected an appeal by a vermont couple 
who said their property rights were being trampled to satisfy the 
nations backtonature and physicalfitness boom 
the court upheld a 1983 law known as the railstotrails 
act that permits unused rail lines to be converted into nature 
trails 
in other decisions the court 
voted 72 to limit the authority of the white house office of 
management and budget to revise federal jobsafety rules to reduce 
paperwork for private businesses 
upheld by a 54 vote in a colorado case federal regulations 
aimed at saving the government time and money when it mistakenly 
overpays some social security recipients 
reinstated by a 54 vote a 61 million award against the 
arthur young amp co accounting firm won by investors in the farmers 
cooperative of arkansas and oklahoma 
in the abandoned rail line case the court said j paul 
preseault and his wife patricia of burlington vt have not 
shown their rights were violated by a 72mile bicycle path that 
passes through their lakefront property 
the bike trail replaced a vermont railway line after train 
service ended in 1975 and the tracks were torn up 
the interstate commerce commission approved the conversion under 
the 1983 federal law 
justice william j brennan writing for the court said the 
preseaults still can file a claim for compensation against the 
federal government under a separate law 
the preseaults said they may continue their fight 
i guess at this point im stunned j paul preseault said 
i didnt do this go all the way to the supreme court to have 
them tell me to file my case in another court i wasnt looking for 
money i wanted my property rights honored 
the preseaults said the 1983 law violates the constitutions 
fifth amendment which bars the taking of private property without 
just compensation and also said it interferes unlawfully with 
interstate commerce 
brennan said the railstotrails law is a legitimate exercise of 
congressional power aimed at encouraging the development of 
additional recreational trails 
the ruling could affect a large number of property owners the 
nations railway system at its peak in 1920 with 272000 miles of 
track is now down to 141000 miles and 3000 more miles are 
abandoned each year 
ownership of the land claimed by the preseaults is in dispute 
vermont officials say the property belongs to the state 
but if the preseaults own the property they say they have a 
right under vermont law to use the land once the rail line is 
abandoned 
but the 1983 federal law an amended version of the earlier 
national trails system act allows for railroad rightsofway to 
be maintained for possible future railroad use while the land is 
converted at least temporarily to nature trails 
this practice known as rail banking is at the heart of 
wednesdays ruling 
vermont entered into a lease with the city of burlington that 
allows the city to maintain the rightofway as a trail while 
preserving it for possible rail use 
citing the statecity agreement the interstate commerce 
commission rejected the preseaults bid to have the rail line 
declared officially abandoned 
the preseaults said the railbanking provisions are a sham to 
conceal the true purpose of the federal law preventing railroad 
rightsofway from being returned to their rightful owners after 
abandonment 
the couple said the railbanking procedure disguises the fact 
that the rail lines have been abandoned 
brennan rejected that argument 
the law is not invalid merely because more draconian measures 
such as a program of mandatory conversions or a prohibition of 
all abandonments might advance more completely the railbanking 
purpose he said the history of congressional attempts to 
address the problem of rail abandonments provides sufficient reason 
to defer to congress he added

the government imposed a nighttime 
curfew wednesday in kosovo province where more than two dozen 
people have died this year in ethnic clashes 
the official tanjug news agency said sovietbuilt t55 tanks and 
armored personnel carriers patrolled the streets of most kosovo 
towns to enforce the 9 pm to 4 am curfew 
tanjug said yugoslav authorities decided tuesday that the curfew 
was needed to defend the constitutional order and prevent 
violence 
mig21 fighters streaked at low altitude over several towns and 
small groups of heavily armed soldiers patrolled villages sources 
in the region said 
thousands of serbs had rallied for three days in kosovo polje a 
suburb of the provincial capital of pristina demanding a curfew 
and protesting what they claimed were threats by ethnic albanian 
separatists and terroritsts 
ethnic albanians comprise 90 percent of the population in 
kosovo a province of the serbian republic they oppose moves by 
serbian leaders to more tightly control the province 
one person died tuesday and dozens were injured in clashes 
between security forces and tens of thousands of ethnic albanian 
demonstrators demanding free elections an end to a yearold state 
of emergency and the release of political prisoners 
since january 28 ethnic albanians have been killed in ethnic 
unrest according to official figures the same number were killed 
in all of last year 
during the curfew movements and gatherings of people for the 
purpose of demonstrating were strictly forbidden said belgrade 
radio 
some small protests were reported during the day mainly 
involving ethnic albanian schoolchildren and youths who taunted 
riot police in several towns 
a journalist who spoke by telephone from the region said nearly 
all ethnic albanian students boycotted classes and at least 30000 
workers continued a 2weekold strike to protest what they 
described as police repression 
serbian students at pristina university demanded that 
authorities guarantee their safety from ethnic albanians 
tanjug said 
the students also demanded that all university officials who 
supported past demonstrations by albanian students be fired and 
threatened to continue their education outside the province if 
the demands were not met tanjug said 
the students also want authorities to jail the leaders of seven 
new opposition movements the serbs accused the students of 
inciting demonstrations and strikes by ethnic albanians last month 
the independent groups on wednesday appealed to kosovo residents 
not to demonstrate 
the authorities are trying to provoke an intercommunal 
conflict in kosovo said the appeal 
tanjug said several bus companies from outside kosovo have 
discontinued service to the province because they fear attacks 
last month at least five buses were badly damaged by 
stonethrowing demonstrators tanjug said

from all over 
phooey says its owner its a nuisance and should be chopped 
down 
the tree is smelly messy and very brittle making it a hazard 
to the children who are continually climbing it said patrick 
gillespie besides i am the one responsible for maintaining it 
and it is quite a job 
mayor scott newberg said a national society of gingko tree 
admirers frequently has its annual meeting in here because of the 
100foot tree 
gillespie is aware of the trees historic value and says hes 
wrestled with his conscience for years before deciding the 
rational thing to do is cut it down 
in addition to raking up its leaves in the fall gillespie says 
he must have the tree sprayed to prevent the growth of its nuts 
which form inside plumlike fleshy fruits that stink like rancid 
butter 
everyone else has the idea that i am calloused he said i 
appreciate their point of view but they are not looking at mine 
im the one who has to live with it in my backyard

atlantis commander got a sore 
throat wednesday forcing nasa to postpone for at least 24 hours 
the launch of the shuttle on a secret allmilitary mission to put 
a spy satellite in orbit 
a space agency statement said a bad weather forecast also was a 
factor in the postponement but officials said that if not for the 
illness they would have continued the countdown hoping for clear 
skies by launch time early thursday 
navy capt john o creighton has basically a sore throat with 
a little head congestion said agency spokesman kyle herring 
he does not have a fever it could be an indication of a cold 
coming on 
herring said creighton would not be replaced on the flight 
because his illness is not serious nasa said creightons health 
and the weather will be evaluated thursday in deciding whether to 
attempt a launch friday morning 
weve never had a postponement due to the illness of an 
astronaut this is the first time in the space program herring 
said 
in 1970 astronaut thomas k mattingly was taken off the apollo 
13 crew a few days before the flight was to lift off for the moon 
but backuop astronaut jack swigert replaced him without delaying 
the flight 
herring said creighton and the other four atlantis crew members 
were healthy when they took a physical exam on tuesday and that 
creighton had approached the flight surgeon wednesday with his 
problem all have been in semiisolation the last week their 
contact limited to immediate family members and essential launch 
official to reduce the possibility of exposure to illness 
the afternoon announcement came shortly before technicians were 
to begin pumping more than half a million gallons of propellant 
into atlantis fuel tank for the fourday mission which was to end 
at edwards air force base calif 
a bleak forecast early wednesday had gradually improved 
throughout the day to a 5050 chance for a fiery night launch on 
thursday but the outlook for friday and saturday was even worse 
with one cold front moving out and another moving in 
because the pentagon mission is classified the space agency 
would not provide the exact launch time saying only that it would 
occur between midnight and 4 am thursday however sources said 
that atlantis was to lift off at 1 am 
atlantis orbit reportedly will cover a greater area of the 
globe than any previous shuttle so that the satellite once 
released by the fivemember crew can gather intelligence over 
northern areas of the soviet union where there are numerous 
military bases and missile sites 
to reach the high latitude the shuttle is expected to fly into 
orbit on a course skirting the east coast flying within a few 
hundred miles of shore 
thus if weather conditions are right residents along the 
eastern seaboard as far north as new jersey might see atlantis 
fiery tail 
this is the sixth secret military mission and fourth afterdark 
launch in 34 shuttle flights the launch time is dictated by the 
destination of the cargo 
creightons crew is air force col john h casper the pilot 
and mission specialists marine lt col david c hilmers air force 
col richard m mullane and navy lt cmdr pierre j thuot 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity reported the 
astronauts were to deploy a 37300pound 500 million spy 
satellite capable of taking supersharp reconnaissance photos and 
listening in on military and diplomatic communications around the 
world 
placed into a high inclination orbit the spy satellite will 
pass over most of the soviet union including northern areas not 
previously probed by shuttlelaunched satellites this orbit may be 
important in verifying soviet compliance with arms agreements now 
being negotiated between the us and the soviet union 
the soviets have their own satellites to monitor compliance 
military officials said the secrecy surrounding defense 
department shuttle flights is necessary to make it more difficult 
for soviet reconnaissance satellites and spy ship off cape 
canaveral to track the spacecraft 
but critics argue that soviet intelligence agents undoubtedly 
already know a great deal about atlantis mission and once the 
shuttle is in orbit they will be able to track it precisely and 
know what it is doing

the chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee on wednesday called for a more coordinated foreign trade 
policy in the 1990 farm bill as a way to bolster agricultural 
income 
i would love to come here and promise american farmers that 
the federal government will have more money to help them compete 
internationally said sen patrick leahy dvt but the 
realities of our budget deficit make this unlikely 
he said more needs to be done with the funds available 
we should target the most promising markets and adopt a 
longterm market development strategy for those markets said 
leahy suggesting that the developing world holds the brightest 
future for us exports 
leahy directed his comments to richard crowder undersecretary 
for international affairs and commodity programs at the agriculture 
department during the last hearing the senate agriculture 
committee has scheduled on trade issues in preparation for the farm 
bill 
the senator said several studies have criticized federal export 
promotion programs he said that one bank participating in one of 
those programs is being investigated on fraud charges 
the bank a branch of the national bank of italy in atlanta 
ga has extended millions of dollars in loans guaranteed by the 
agriculture departments commodity credit corp to iraq 
leahy questioned whether the country was a good credit risk he 
said there had been rumors that iraq was diverting the commodities 
for purposes other than feeding its citizens 
crowder said iraqs repayment record had been excellent 
we have audited some of the exporters records and found 
nothing to conclude there had been diversions said crowder 
he said the criminal investigation of the bank was being handled 
by banking authorities not the usda and as long as the loans were 
being repaid the usda was satisfied 
sen richard lugar rind asked crowder the departments 
philosophy on using the export enhancement program a bonus program 
for exporters that makes us commodities less expensive for 
foreign buyers 
crowder said the main criteria was whether the european 
community sells to a certain country and if the united states could 
displace european sales 
as long as the european community is selling we will provide 
export bonuses said crowder the bush and reagan administrations 
both have characterized the subsidies the ec puts on agricultural 
products it exports as trade unfair 
us negotiators engaged in the ongoing uruguay round of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade talk are trying to get the 
europeans to soften their subsidy system but administration 
officials including agriculture secretary clayton yeutter have 
said us subsidies will not be dropped until there is a 
multilateral agreement 
the talks usually referred to as gatt are expected to be 
complete at the end of this year their outcome could lead to 
revisions in us farm policy 
among the administrations proposals for the farm bill is a 
lifting of the ceiling congress put on the amount that can be 
traded under the export enhancement program

two opposition party activists were 
beaten to death and the tongue of one victim was cut out by party 
opponents the traditionally anticommunist national peasants party 
alleged wednesday 
peasants party spokesman valentin gabrielescu declined to make 
specific accusations about who was behind the reported killings 
but suggested they were politically motivated 
three suspects have been arrested in the feb 11 death and 
mutilation of vasile velescu gabrielescu said refusing to 
identify them or their possible motives 
he said only that velescu 60 was killed because he was the 
chief of our organization in bacau 180 miles northeast of 
bucharest 
another party activist from calarasi county in southern 
romania also was murdered gabrielescu said he refused to name 
the victim or give further details saying he was following the 
wishes of the victims family 
there was no independent confirmation of the alleged murders 
which would be the first ones with apparent political motives since 
the end of the revolution that overthrew and executed communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu in december 
gabrielescu warned of the possibility of further violence 
against the peasants party the strongest rival of the national 
salvation front in romanias elections in may the front governed 
alone for six weeks after the revolution before being pressured to 
share power with 37 other parties in a provisional council of 
national unity 
peasants party members were afraid to go to investigate 
exactly what happened gabrielescu said 
meanwhile romanias newly appointed minister of defense said 
that the securitate ceausescus infamous secret police had been 
completely dissolved the securitate battled the army and civilians 
in the december revolution 
but col gen victor stanculescu said a new security force would 
be formed to protect the states interests his comments were an 
apparent attempt to quell persistent concern that securitate forces 
continued to operate 
a new security apparatus composed of army officers who have 
proved their loyalty to the state would be created to protect 
it from those who would destablize society he told the 
independent romania libera 
in bucharest and elsewhere 3294 securitate members were put on 
reserve army status including 611 officers of the former 
counterespionage unit he said 
the majority who gave illegal orders or contributed to the 
repression of the revolution are under investigation under arrest 
and will be tried he said 
supervisory groups from the ministry of defense have been posted 
in all the surveillance and bugging centers run by the securitate 
and the listening equipment is being destroyed stanculescu said 
deputy prime minister gelu voican said 15000 full time 
employees each with an undetermined number of civilian informers 
had worked for the securitate

earths population of 52 billion 
people will increase this decade by nearly 1 billion the fastest 
population growth in history a united nations official said 
wednesday 
the population is increasing by three people every second or 
about a quarter of a million every day said nafis sadik executive 
director of the united nations population fund 
in 1990 alone 90 million to 100 million people or about the 
combined population of the philippines and south korea will be 
added in the world she said 
by and large the biggest increases will happen in the poorest 
countries those by definition least equipped to meet the needs of 
the new arrivals and invest in their future mrs sadik said in a 
speech at the weeklong one asia assembly 
in 1984 population growth was slowing everywhere except in 
africa and parts of south asia but the decline was not enough she 
said today the situation looks less promising progress in 
reducing birth rates has been slower than expected 
unless the trend is reversed soon she said the worlds 
population by the end of the next century probably would reach 14 
billion rather than the 10 billion to 11 billion now projected 
she said many asian governments have declared a determined 
effort to reduce population growth but many countries continue to 
grow at an average of 2 percent to 25 percent annually 
in southeast asia she added rapid population growth is 
damaging the economic gains many countries have achieved 
one consequence of rapid population growth is to hold back or 
cripple altogether the prospects of balanced development she 
said in rural areas landholdings are already small generation 
by generation they are growing smaller and their owners poorer 
population growth has swallowed up most of the benefit from 
investment and services 
population growth also threatens food supplies and the 
environment she added 
nations should not wait to become industrialized before 
launching population control programs she said indonesia south 
korea and thailand made great economic strides while at the same 
time controlling population growth 
my vision of the future despite the gloomy statistics i 
quoted earlier is quite optimistic she said asian countries 
have shown that population programs can be successful this is the 
first step toward a sustainable development

congressional investigators issued subpoenas 
wednesday for three former officials of a new jersey public housing 
authority accused of receiving improper salaries including one who 
was paid for four jobs at the same time 
the house subcommittee that has been investigating scandals at 
the department of housing and urban development voted to subpoena 
paul a marguglio who was suspended from his job as executive 
director of the passaic nj public housing authority following a 
hud audit 
also subpoenaed was his wife louise marguglio and the passaic 
authoritys suspended deputy executive director donald v pieri 
both were accused by auditors of receiving excessive pay 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the government operations 
subcommittee on employment and housing said none of the three had 
responded to requests to appear before the panel voluntarily 
we have received no cooperation lantos said therefore 
the subcommittee has no option but to issue a subpoena for these 
individuals 
the subpoena for each was approved on 70 votes with 
republicans joining democrats in voting to compel their appearance 
they were ordered to appear march 2 or at another date set by 
lantos 
according to an audit by the hud inspector general and testimony 
before the lantos panel paul marguglio received more than 245000 
in salaries during 1988 for holding two fulltime and two parttime 
job titles with the passaic public housing authority 
louise marguglio according to the subcommittee was paid more 
than 95000 as the authoritys director of administration between 
january 1986 and her retirement in april 1988 but worked only one 
day auditors concluded she received at least 50000 in improper 
compensation 
pieri according to auditors also held more than one job and 
received more than 106000 in salary his job as deputy executive 
director was budgeted to receive 57970 in annual salary 
bruce nagel a new jersey attorney for the marguglios declined 
to comment on the subpoenas or on the allegations against his 
clients 
congressional staff investigators said in a memo prepared for 
members of the panel that neither nagel nor the three former 
officials had replied to letters and phone calls from the panels 
staff 
nagel denied that he had failed to respond to the committee 
thats absolutely not true he said ive responded 
repeatedly every time i call their subcommittee people are not 
available 
nagel said he did not represent pieri efforts to reach pieri 
were unsuccessful his telephone number was unpublished 
the passaic audit prompted hud to begin a national investigation 
to look for similar activities hud general counsel frank keating 
told congress earlier this month however that the department 
believed salary abuses uncovered at passaic were a unique 
situation 
public housing authorities such as the one in passaic are local 
agencies that operate primarily with federal hud money 
paul adams the hud inspector general said the federal 
government was likely defrauded when the passaic authoritys 
commissioners approved more than 245000 in 1988 pay to paul 
marguglio he said his office is investigating further

a quadriplegic who won court permission to shut 
off his lifesustaining ventilator told lawmakers wednesday that 
the states way of caring for the severely disabled was a big 
reason behind his wish to die 
larry mcafee 34 appeared before the georgia senate to plead 
for changes in georgias system of care for the disabled which he 
called obsolete and cruel 
although he has changed his mind and decided to live mcafee 
said the quality of his life since he was paralyzed in 1985 has 
been poor primarily because he has been in institutions 
when you look at me try to remember that but for the grace 
of god you could be like i am he said speaking slowly and 
sometimes gasping for breath imagine being 34 years old and 
being forced to live in a nursing home far from your family and 
friends 
mcafee asked a superior court judge in atlanta last year to 
grant him permission to unplug the ventilator that has helped him 
breathe since he was paralyzed from the chin down in a 1985 
motorcycle accident 
the court agreed and the ruling was upheld by the state supreme 
court but the case raised questions about the quality of life 
states provide for the disabled advocates for the disabled later 
persuaded mcafee to change his mind about dying and promised to 
help him find employment 
mcafee a mechanical engineer and outdoorsman before his 
accident is dependent on medicaid and medicare to pay for the care 
he receives in an alabaster ala nursing home equipped to care 
for patients on ventilators 
he has said that depression over becoming an indigent ward of 
the state contributed to his wish to die 
he described life with paralysis as existence without choice 
and said the disabled are prisoners of bureaucracy that doesnt 
address the quality of our shattered lives 
i will never never get used to being totally paralyzed and 
helpless mcafee said but i have accepted it as my fate 
mcafee said the state should adopt programs of independent 
living for the disabled and should not send them to outofstate 
nursing homes 
unless i and others like me have your help we have no hope 
for the future he said if only some of you would have the 
courage to push for change 
sen hildred shumake who invited mcafee to speak said he will 
work to change the system that forces disabled people to remain in 
institutions 
he went to school in my district and hes my age shumake 
said i felt that something should be done for him

world bank president barber conable will 
sign two loans totaling 360 million thursday the first to poland 
since it rejoined the development agency 
the loans that we will sign are the opening part of an 
extended program that can last as long as the courageous course 
continues conable said at a news conference wednesday 
poland which rejoined the world bank in 1986 stands to receive 
half of the 5 billion the 152country agency plans to make 
available to eastern europe in the next three years to fuel 
economic reform 
future lending being negotiated with the world bank includes 
environmental projects energy development telecommunications and 
a structural adjustment loan to support polands balance of 
payments and other potential casualities of the dramatic economic 
restructuring under way 
conable said he envisions a strong pipeline of diverse loans 
addressed to repair and improvement of the infrastructure 
he said the first loans signal the strength of support for the 
polish economic program 
we are not here to provide shortterm relief but to contribute 
to the longterm growth he said 
but conable stressed that future borrowing depends on polands 
resolve to stick to the harsh reform measures adopted jan 1 to cap 
inflation close the budget deficit and reshape the nations 
centrally controlled socialist economy as a marketdriven system 
it is an extremely difficult complex and heroic program 
conable said 
he said that after two days of meetings with government and 
financial leaders he finds the public mood strongly supportive 
at this point and is encouraged by the courage the polish 
people are showing 
the economic reform plan has sent prices soaring as government 
subsidies to staterun industries are cut inflation was put at 
nearly 79 percent in january and substantial unemployment is 
anticipated as unprofitable enterprises close 
the world bank loans follow international monetary fund approval 
of economic reform plan drafted by polands new noncommunist 
government 
a 260 million loan will support industrial export while the 
second 100 million loan will finance agricultural development 
both are intended to break bottlenecks such as poor 
packaging and lack of machine parts that stymie production in 
polands outmoded industries and undermechanized farming said 
janel loos the world banks expert on poland 
the 17year loans will be made available to polands national 
bank which will extend credit to commercial banks for lending to 
industries that meet the world banks criteria for viability and 
repayment potential 
conable said poland must seek further agreements with the paris 
club the informal group of 17 countries that holds 27 billion of 
the 40 billion foreign debt 
the paris club agreed friday to reschedule nearly 10 billion in 
polish debts suspending all payments until march 1991 and 
spreading out the rest over 14 years poland is seeking reduction 
of the debt 
also on wednesday a european community spokesman said polish 
and hungarian farmers should lose fewer crops this year to disease 
because of agricultural chemicals the trading bloc will supply in 
the next two months 
the 61 million in insecticides and herbicides will come from 
the ecs 366 million aid package for poland and hungary 
nico wegter ec spokesman for foreign affairs said the products 
had to be supplied urgently so that they could be used before 
spring sowing begins

the fbi wont have to cut 400 agents from its 
payroll next year because it has found new ways to save money under 
president bushs proposed 1991 fiscalyear budget the justice 
department said wednesday 
the costcutting measures were worked out in the last few weeks 
since bushs budget proposal was sent to congress said justice 
department spokesman david runkel 
under the proposed budget the fbi would have been forced to cut 
more than 400 agents from its payroll probably through attrition 
in order to finance an estimated 42 million in additional overtime 
expenses 
a new law passed by congress last year increases the overtime 
pay for federal law enforcement officers including fbi agents 
after the budget was unveiled fbi officials said the bureau 
would be forced to cut more than 400 agents from its workforce of 
more tan 10000 
but under the new plan to pay for the overtime costs the fbi 
will stagger the hiring of 338 new agents provided in the 1991 
budget to investigate organized crime drugs and whitecollar 
fraud said an fbi official 
the hiring of these additional agents will be spread out over 
the 1991 fiscal year to save money said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity the fbi will also save money by postponing 
purchase of some new equipment said the official

a man who went berserk on a city street and bit at 
least eight people before he collapsed and died was suffering from 
aids police said wednesday and they encouraged his victims to 
call health authorities 
experts say there are no known instances of aids being 
transmitted by biting but police said they were issuing the appeal 
as a precaution 
the incident occurred feb 7 when jean marc rosius 28 who gave 
his address as a homeless shelter began accosting passersby said 
police spokesman ray lang 
at least four people were bitten seriously enough to be 
hospitalized including some who had flaps of skin hanging off arms 
and faces 
the arresting officer orestes guas was also bitten and 
treated lang said 
after mr rosius was subdued he had breathing difficulties 
and was transported to jackson memorial hospital where he died 
said lang 
an autopsy found that rosius who had a history of mental 
problems had used cocaine and had aids 
at this point what were doing is recommending that anyone 
who had any contact with mr rosius if they were bitten or 
scratched or had any relationship at all contact their local 
aids hotline he said 
in addition to the four people hospitalized three others 
initially reported that they had been bitten authorities think 
they may be illegal aliens who are reluctant to come forward 
one of those bitten and hospitalized was guillermo herrada 54 
this is the worst news ive ever had in my life herrada 
said tuesday i dont know what im going to do 
there arent documented instances of hiv the aids virus 
transmitted by a human bite but in health care settings there 
have been instances of hiv transmitted by blood through a needle 
stick said constance wofsy professor of clinical medicine at 
the university of california at san francisco 
theres a theoretic possibility that falls between no reported 
cases and the hypothetical risk of blood being exchanged through a 
deep bite she said

a new storm system raised the threat of more flooding wednesday 
in the saturated south where heavy rains last week were blamed for 
nine deaths 
there are places that have no room to put more rain im 
talking about completely saturated dusty perkins of the 
mississippi emergency management agency said wednesday 
if heavy rain falls in areas that are already inundated we 
are going to certainly have an aggravated situation in terms of 
more evacuations and additional damage 
the rain was associated with a strong low pressure system and 
cold front moving eastward from the texas gulf coast 
by midday showers and thunderstorms already extended from the 
eastern half of texas across louisiana southern alabama 
southwestern arkansas and southern through western oklahoma the 
national weather service said 
during the six hours up to noon 266 inches fell at palacios 
texas and 125 inches at victoria texas 
flood watches were posted to the east as far as northwestern 
florida 
since late last week floods have been blamed for three deaths 
each in georgia and alabama two in mississippi and one in north 
carolina 
in southern mississippi residents along the pascagoula river 
system were told to prepare for what could be the worst flooding in 
years the pascagoula at merrill was up to 247 feet and still 
rising wednesday heading toward a predicted 27foot crest friday 
flood stage is 22 feet 
the question now is how much more rain are we going to get 
said hank turk jackson county public safety director 
rivers were receding over much of alabama but the ground was 
saturated and the weather service predicted 2 to 4 inches of rain 
meaning some streams would likely jump their banks again 
the additional rain comes while damage estimates for the floods 
that began last week are still far from complete 
our damage figures continue to increase as flood waters recede 
and we are able to get into areas that were under water said 
rudy duncan who is directing the red cross operation in alabama 
georgia gov joe frank harris has asked for 157 million in 
federal disaster aid for nine counties because of floods and 
tornadoes 
up to 5 inches of rain was forecast from the new round of storms 
in mississippi but the weather might be less severe in georgia 
producing up to 2 inches instead of the 10 that hit parts of 
georgia last weekend 
it will be cooler than last week so that will limit the rain 
a little bit said weather service hydrologist russell post in 
atlanta but theres still a potential for several inches of 
rain

a convicted palestinian terrorist has 
dropped his appeal in a bombing case after a codefendant confessed 
to involvement news reports said wednesday 
a district court in december sentenced abu talb and marten 
imandi to life in prison for three bombings in denmark and the 
netherlands in 1985 and 1986 both pleaded innocent and later 
appealed their convictions 
however imandi confessed earlier this month to having carried 
the trunks containing the bombs one person was killed and several 
injured in the explosions outside american and israeli targets in 
copenhagen and amsterdam 
since the confession of marten imandi has rendered a trial of 
the case in the appellate court pointless i hereby recall my 
notice of appeal the national news agency tt quoted abu talb as 
saying in a letter to the court 
abu talb has been named as a possible suspect in the explosion 
of pan ams flight 103 over lockerbie scotland in december 1988 
a total of 270 people died in the bombing which was linked to abu 
talb through clothes found in the suitcase containing the bomb 
abu talbs lawyer svenerik sjogren told tt the decision to 
drop the appeal has no connection with the lockerbie case 
despite his confession imandi is still appealing to challenge 
his life sentence 
the appeals trial opens in stockholm on wednesday for him and a 
third defendant moustafa mougrabi he was sentenced to one year in 
prison 
his brother mahmoud mougrabi also confessed to taking part in

the nations winter wheat region has returned 
to february reality after weeks of balmy temperatures the 
governments joint agricultural weather facility said wednesday 
winter returned to the northern and central plains as arctic 
air plunged south and reversed the warm spell of the last two 
months the facility said in its report for feb 1117 
rain benefited winter wheat in portions of the central and 
southern great plains the report said although additional 
moisture was needed in kansas 
the facility is operated by the departments of agriculture and 
commerce the weekly reports cover weather and crop conditions but 
do not include crop production forecasts 
in a related report the usda said wheat inventories may drop to 
443 million bushels by the beginning of the next marketing year on 
june 1 the lowest in 15 years and down from 702 million bushels a 
year ago 
however increases in planted area and a return to normal 
yields in 1990 will likely allow modest stock rebuilding if use is 
similar to the previous two years the departments economic 
research service said 
the us area planted to winter wheat last fall is up 3 percent 
even though an additional 19 million acres of wheat base were 
enrolled in the conservation reserve program during 1989 
while the winter wheat crop in the southern plains was 
stressed by dryness in the fall and early winter precipitation and 
relatively mild temperatures in january and february have raised 
crop prospects the report said nonetheless timely rains will 
be needed in coming months

czechoslovak president vaclav havel told 
congress wednesday that his nation welcomes us help after decades 
of soviet domination but that eventually europe must decide for 
itself how long american and soviet troops should remain 
his speech to a joint meeting of the house and senate came a 
day after president bush told the playwrightturnedpresident that 
nato would continue to play a vital role in assuring stability 
and security in europe and that the united states would maintain 
a strong military presence 
at bushs request havel returned to the white house after his 
speech to congress white house aides said the 45minute return 
session was not designed to smooth over any differences on troop 
levels but to complete talks on economic issues and trade 
they didnt get to all the items yesterday said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater he said they talked at 
length wednesday about the future of europe and agreed to stay in 
close contact during this period of rapid change 
havel the first of the new east european leaders to address 
congress said the united states could best help his country by 
pressing the soviet union to stay on its own road to democracy 
he said he recognized a need for us troops in europe 
but he added sooner or later europe must recover and come 
into its own and decide for itself how many of whose soldiers it 
needs 
in a speech that was largely philosophical havel said americans 
need to learn along with his country how to put morality ahead 
of politics science and economics 
havel who reluctantly accepted the popular mandate of his 
country to lead during its time of rapid transition received a 
twominute standing ovation in the crowded house chamber and 
appeared somewhat stiff and surprised at the reception 
as he began to speak us tennis star and former czechoslovak 
citizen martina navratilova dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief 
in the top row of the visitors gallery 
speaking through a translator havel called czechoslovakia one 
of eastern europes wayward children and said it wants to 
coordinate its return to the economic and political mainstream with 
hungary poland and other nations emerging from 40 years of soviet 
domination 
the united states can best aid that return he said by helping 
the soviet union on its irreversible but immensely complicated 
road to democracy 
the more quickly and the more peacefully the soviet union 
begins to move along the road towards genuine political pluralism 
and economic reform the better it will be not just for czechs 
and slovaks but for the whole world he said 
addressing reporters later havel declined to elaborate on that 
call saying it was not his place to suggest specific moves to the 
united states 
the members of congress came to their feet when havel said his 
countrys peaceful revolution was inspired by the us 
constitution bill of rights and declaration of independence 
they inspire us to be citizens he said 
after his white house meeting havel was leaving washington for 
new york and meetings with business leaders and a rock concert in 
his honor 
havel the first head of state from his country to visit 
washington said that europe is leaving the antiquated 
straitjacket of a world dominated by two superpowers for one in 
which nations can stand more independently 
lawmakers applauded his conclusion that american troops will be 
able to return home because europe will at last be able to stand 
guard over itself 
in the meantime he declared czechoslovakia is returning to 
europe 
havel called for the removal of as many soviet military 
units as possible from his country before national elections 
scheduled for june 
he also called for moving up the helsinki ii international 
conference now planned for 1992 and turning it into a european 
peace conference that would finally put a formal end to the 
second world war and all its unhappy consequences at a brief 
news conference later he suggested such a meeting might come in 
1991 
turning philosophical he said years of repression have given 
his countrymen time to ponder what is truly important and said 
americans can learn from that experience as well 
the salvation of this human world lies nowhere else than in 
the human heart in the human power to reflect in human meekness 
and human responsibility havel told the lawmakers 
we are still under the sway of the destructive and vain belief 
that man is the pinnacle of creation and not just a part of it 
and that therefore everything is permitted 
his speech came a day after havel got promises from bush of 
freer trade between the two countries and incentives for new 
investment and economic development 
the bush administration and leading lawmakers also have proposed 
expanding an aid program begun last year for poland and hungary to 
include czechoslovakia and other countries emerging from soviet 
domination 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee has proposed sweetening the program with an 
additional 511 million next year and including new countries that 
meet certain tests for economic and political reform 
havel did not directly address the question of aid but at one 
point commented that greater stability in europe would lead to 
reductions in us military spending the millions you give to 
the east today will soon return to you in the form of billions in 
savings he said

the irish republican army claimed 
responsibility wednesday for a bombing near an army van in the 
center of leicester that shook buildings knocked down pedestrians 
and slightly injured three people 
in a separate incident a stonethrowing crowd forced police 
officers to release five people suspected of planning to attack an 
army helicopter authorities said wednesday three suspects were 
recaptured later however 
a forensic examination had established similarities between 
tuesdays bomb in leicester 100 miles northwest of london and a 
device found after an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate lt gen 
sir david ramsbotham in londons fashionable kensington district on 
nov 14 said assistant chief constable tony butler 
both were homemade devices containing 4 to 5 pounds of 
highpowered plastic explosive and mercury tilt switches and were 
attached to the bottom of the vehicles by magnets he said 
on both occasions the magnets failed and the bombs fell onto 
the road preventing death or serious injury 
the ira claimed responsibility for tuesdays blast in a 
statement wednesday night to britains domestic news agency press 
association 
the blast shook buildings within 200 yards and shattered more 
than two dozen windows at a nearby unused factory sending shards 
of glass over a wide area 
the vans driver a womens royal army corps sergeant and her 
passenger a coldstream guards sergeant escaped with only minor 
injuries as did a passerby who was showered with glass 
home secretary david waddington on wednesday described the blast 
as another diabolical enterprise by the ira 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in northern ireland and 
unite the province where protestants outnumber catholics 3 to 2 
with the republic of ireland where 95 percent of the people are 
catholic 
in their report on the alleged plan to shoot down the 
helicopter police said the crew of the aircraft spotted masked men 
preparing an ambush outside cullyhanna village in south armagh 
the area is known as bandit country because of its links 
with the ira and because it is close to the border with the irish 
republic 
the crew radioed an alert to police but the attack squad 
apparently heard it on their own radio and fled toward the border 
authorities said 
police arriving at the scene reported finding three rifles and 
two heavy machine guns that can fire 800 armorpiercing bullets a 
minute they have been used by the ira in past attacks on 
helicopters 
the police chased the group which hijacked and abandoned eight 
cars in their escape attempt over narrow twisting country roads 
they were finally cornered in silverbridge village 
however the police said they had to set their captives free 
when the officers were surrounded and stoned by a crowd of about 40 
men in a housing project the police managed to resume the chase 
and make three arrests but at least two suspects escaped

soviet legislators were given copies wednesday of 
proposed constitutional changes that would make the presidency now 
held by mikhail s gorbachev much more powerful 
gorbachev has urged the supreme soviet to approve the plan for a 
westernstyle presidential system of government 
vladimir tumanov of the institute of state and law in moscow 
who helped draft the proposal said copies were distributed 
wednesday and the supreme soviet held closed committee meetings 
tumanov said he had not seen the final version and could not give 
details 
news reports said the changes would provide for the president to 
be elected to terms of either five or six years and give him the 
power to veto legislation which could be overriden 
according to the published accounts 
sergei stankevich a member of a parliamentary commission that 
considers draft laws submitted to the supreme soviet said the 
soviet president would have most of the powers of his french and 
american counterparts with few of the constitutional limitations 
deputies from the baltic states are alarmed about provisions 
that would impose severe restrictions on the rights of republics to 
secede and permit authorities to crack down on nationalist 
organizations 
stankevich said i dont think this new legislation will be 
acceptable to anyone who believes in a constitutional system of 
checks and balances 
alexander yakovlev an aide to gorbachev said the presidential 
system was necessary to ensure stable development of democracy in 
the soviet union 
the reports said the president would be empowered to declare an 
emergency without the relevant republics consent to rule by 
decree when the supreme soviet was not in session and to cancel 
legislation adopted by the legislatures of soviet republics 
they said the parliament could take votes of noconfidence and 
if the president lost he could disband the parliament and call new 
elections

foreign ministry sources said a visit to 
angola by south african foreign minister pik botha expected 
thursday was postponed and would take place march 1 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said wednesday 
angola was informed of the postponement by a telex from south 
africas department of foreign affairs 
botha reportedly will have confer with foreign minister pedro de 
castro van dunem and possibly with president jose eduardo dos 
santos on deteriorating peace prospects here 
bitter fighting intensified wednesday around mavinga 700 miles 
southeast in cuanda cubango province 
an airstrip at mavinga and a nearby rebel base block the 
government forces way to rebel headquarters at jamba more than 
120 miles farther south 
a statement released in lisbon portugal and signed by unita 
chief jonas savimbi said soldiers retreated under rebel pressure 
it gave no details of positions held in the towns 
sevensquaremile area 
the statement claimed that government planes were dropping 
chemical bombs on civilian and military targets behind unita lines 
it said rebels captured more than 15 pilots and tank engineers 
in the clashes and would turn them over to zairean president mobutu 
sese seko who was appointed mediator after a shortlived truce 
last june 
unita the national union for the total independence of angola 
has been fighting to force the marxist government in luanda to 
share power since shortly after angola gained independence from 
portugal in 1975 
the battle for mavinga has raged since the government launched 
an offensive late december 
we will resist to the last and in this sense we have been 
able to count on the americans who have guaranteed us material and 
moral support the unita statement said 
unita receives a reported 50 million in us aid yearly 
including sophisticated stinger groundtoair missiles angolan 
troops use soviet weapons 
botha and van dunem will try to set a possible date for a 
meeting here of angolan cuban and south african officials the 
sources said 
angola cuba and south africa signed usbrokered regional 
peace accords in december 1988 in new york that set terms for 
withdrawal of about 50000 cuban soldiers from angola a halt in 
south african aid to unita and independence for namibia formerly 
ruled by south africa 
a meeting of the three nations with us and soviet observers 
had been set for midfebruary but was postponed after cuba 
suspended its troop withdrawal on jan 25 after four cubans died in 
a unita raid in western angola 
cuba and angola said tuesday in luanda the pullout would resume 
sunday after savimbi apologized to cuban president fidel castro 
for the deaths 
an angolanunita truce was agreed on last june but it collapsed 
within weeks and peace talks broke down 
mobutus efforts to get the two parties back to negotiations 
have failed despite backing from the superpowers and african and 
european leaders

hundreds of police were mobilized wednesday to 
protect a tokyo suburb from a war between an affilitate of the 
yamaguchigumi japans largest underworld syndicate and a smaller 
gang 
the violence began last thursday when two members of the 
yamaguchigumi faction led by masaru takumi were beaten to death at 
an office of the nibikikai gang in the suburb hachioji 
in a show of strength wednesday morning dozens of police raided 
the takumi groups headquarters and several other yamaguchigumi 
buildings in osaka western japan 
later wednesday a twoton truck was rammed into the home of 
kazuhiko yanai a nibikikai leader in yokohama a city police 
official reported he said several shots were fired but no one was 
injured 
after gang boss yoshinori watanabe takumi is the most powerful 
leader in the yamaguchigumi which police say has about 21000 
members they declined to estimate the size of the much smaller 
nibikikai 
nearly a dozen gang clashes have been reported since last 
thursday including the fatal shooting of a nibikikai leader in 
hokkaido northern japan thirteen yamaguchigumi members and three 
from nibikikai have been arrested 
on tuesday a yamaguchigumi member turned himself in to 
hachioji police after mistakenly ramming a pickup truck into a 
building he thought belonged to the rival gang officers said no 
one was hurt 
because of that incident and nine shootings police in hachioji 
mobilized 300 to 400 officers wednesdy to crack down on gang 
activity a police official in the suburb said 
children have been told not to walk near the gang office which 
is near an elementary school 
the official who would not let his name be used said hachioji 
police were joined by investigators from tokyos metropolitan 
police department but he would not say how many 
an official at tokyo headquarters who also spoke on condition 
of anonymity said the department held a strategy meeting wednesday 
morning he would not comment further to avoid giving away our 
battle plan 
handguns are illegal in japan and violent crimes are relatively 
rare but police say a threeyear war between the yamaguchigumi 
and the ichiwakai that cost more than 25 lives led many gangs to 
obtain more weapons 
police also say the yamaguchigumis lack of a decisive victory 
in the war which ended last year with the rival leaders 
retirement encouraged other gangs to challenge its turf 
they estimate the total number of gangsters in japan at 90000 
and say nearly half are associated with the three largest gangs 
the yamaguchigumi inagawakai and sumiyoshi rengo 
total underworld income derived mostly from drugs extortion 
and gambling is believed to exceed the equivalent of 9 billion a 
year

some workers at the sellafield 
nuclear reprocessing plant may be counseled not to have children 
because higherthanexpected rates of leukemia have been found 
among workers children a company official said wednesday 
dr roger berry health and safety director for british nuclear 
fuels ltd operator of the plant said workers who want 
individual counseling can get it and if they are so worried the 
advice could be dont have children it is not something 
however that i hope would be widespread advice 
british nuclear fuels later issued a statement saying advising 
workers not to have families is not company policy 
a research team headed by martin gardner professor of medical 
studies at the university of southampton reported in last weeks 
british medical journal that children of men who worked at the 
plant had a higherthanexpected rate of leukemia 
british nuclear fuels said the company had promised medical 
counseling for all employees to ensure they understood the report 
and the risks to them if its findings are confirmed ultimately 
it is then for each individual worker to reach a decision not for 
the company to advise on one course of action or another it said 
gardner met with workers at the plant in northern england on 
wednesday and later said he was urging british nuclear fuels to 
study whether it was possible to minimize radiation exposures of 
younger workers 
these would be the sort of people who were still capable of 
having families and may prefer not working in higher radiation 
levels said gardner adding he did not wish to overstate the 
risks involved 
the risk of a child in this country getting leukemia is 1 in 
2000 while those whose fathers were exposed to the highest 
radiation levels is about 7 in 2000 or 1 in 300 
what i am saying to them is that 299 out of 300 children will 
not get leukemia even if their fathers have been subjected to the 
highest exposure levels 
gardner said he told workers his report did not prove a 
connection between childhood leukemia and radiation exposure to the 
fathers 
it is something that i suggest could be associated and not 
necessarily showing cause and effect he said 
alan johnson director of reprocessing at sellafield said he 
wanted to see more studies on possible links between leukemia and 
radiation 
we have always reduced radiation levels over the past 20 years 
and will continue to reduce them he said 
bernard owen a local official of the general and municipal 
boilermakers union said that as a matter of urgency we want to 
see a followup of his study and the collating of further studies 
into the problem before we can come to a firm conclusion 
martin forwood campaign secretary of core cumbrians opposed 
to a radioactive environment said he hoped wednesdays meetings 
would calm workforce fears 
publicly the workers may not state their worries because they 
are a very loyal and captive work force forwood said 
however i am sure that behind closed doors there must be a 
lot of doubt and concern among them especially among those of the 
reproductive age 
gardners study examined 52 victims of leukemia and lymphoma 
under 25 years old born in the west cumbria health district and 
diagnosed between 195085 they were compared with 1001 control 
children 
one researcher radiotherapist michael snee said the radiation 
probably caused a mutation in the fathers sperm 
in november the medical research council and the imperial 
research fund reported that an increased risk of leukemia is not 
associated with exposure to radiation with the possible exception 
of the sellafield plant which has been plagued by radiation leaks 
gardner said the main finding of his study was that the risk was 
highest for a father who received total exposure exceeding 100 
millisieverts one millisievert equals half a typical individuals 
annual dose from natural radiation or 50 times the dose of a 
single chest xray

a palestinian who is considered a potential 
peace negotiator said wednesday that jewish settlers in the 
occupied lands could stay in a future palestinian state if they 
integrated into arab villages 
people who want to live in mixed jewishmoslemchristian 
villages thats fine but there will be no room for ghettos 
proplo activist faisal husseini said 
he was speaking to about 200 israeli activists of a newly formed 
peace movement of sephardic jews from slums and poor towns 
husseini speaking in hebrew said more than 70000 israelis who 
live in the occupied west bank and gaza strip would have to agree 
to live under palestinian rule if they wished to remain the 
israelis live alongside 17 million palestinians 
the sephardic group called the forum for social justice and 
peace claims a membership of 2000 jewish israelis of arab origin 
such people traditionally have been steadfast supporters of prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
however the new groups leaders want the israeli government to 
begin peace talks with the palestine liberation organization 
we have no choice but to talk to the palestinians even with 
plo chief yasser arafat arafat is showing openness why 
shouldnt we be going for peace said one organizer yehuda 
elush a former likud supporter from the southern town of beersheba 
husseinis 20minute speech was one of a series he has given 
lately to jewish groups as part of a new plobacked strategy to win 
more grassroots sympathy among israelis for the palestinian cause 
husseini a 49yearold historian from israeliannexed east 
jerusalem has been named as a possible negotiator with israel for 
proposed talks in egypt on israels plan for elections in the 
occupied lands 
he has also spent about 18 months in jail during the 
26monthold palestinian uprising on allegations of inciting 
antiisraeli unrest 
in response to a question husseini told his audience that 
palestinians could drop the stonethrowing and firebomb attacks if 
israel ends its strongarm tactics 
if we are offered another path one of compromise from the 
israelis and we are allowed to hold nonviolent demonstrations 
without being attacked by the army then we will take a different 
path we wont need stones firebombs or violence husseini said 
more than 650 arabs have been killed by israelis in the unrest 
and 187 others been slain by fellow palestinians as alleged 
collaborators with israel fortythree israelis also have died

mothers milk contains natural 
tranquilizers swedish researchers reported wednesday 
the results could help explain why babies become calm and fall 
asleep after breast feeding said professor sven dencker of 
lillhagens hospital in goteborg on swedens west coast 
we studied the breast milk of women who were known not to take 
benzodiazepinesubstances tranquilizers and to our suprise we 
found that such substances existed anyway he said in a radio 
interview 
dencker said the quantities were small but existed in all 10 
women included in a control group for research on the effects of 
tranquilizers on women who breast feed 
he said research results were being published in the next issue 
of the british medical journal lancet 
it is feasible that this calming effect played a greater 
role in early history when a family would be surrounded by wild 
animals and it was necessary for survival that children kept 
quiet dencker said 
the svenska dagbladet daily said discovery of natural 
tranquilizers in mothers milk could explain why human cells have 
natural receptors for benzodiazepines the function of the 
receptors has been a mystery it said

gaining the participation of climbing teams from the soviet 
union and china which only recently eased relations after decades 
of mutual hostility took a little shuttle diplomacy whittaker 
said 
when he approached the chinese in 1987 they told him they were 
interested but would only invite the soviets if they knew in 
advance the soviets would say yes they didnt want to lose 
face whittaker said 
in moscow he said the soviets told him they would participate 
only if they knew for sure they were invited 
they thought the chinese may be trying to embarrass them he 
said 
so he returned to china where he finally was told mr 
whittaker you may bring your soviet friends to our mountain 
when you get enough people behind a movement the environment 
and peace leaders will get smart and get in front or be 
toppled whittaker said 
whittaker said the team members will plant their national flags 
and bounce signals off a us space satellite to broadcast live 
television footage of the event each will speak to their nations 
leader by telephone 
the idea for the peace climb was hatched during a 1981 ascent of 
the 14411foot mount rainier during which whittaker and two 
friends guided several disabled climbers to the summit 
they wondered what else they could do to make the world a better 
place to live to show that people from entirely different worlds 
can work together toward a common goal 
on the day of the climb children from several american schools 
will climb nearby hills and pick up garbage as they go whittaker 
said 
on the peace climb dozens of climbers hauling gear and food 
from lower camps to higher camps to support the summit assault will 
stop on their way down to fill empty duffels with trash left behind 
by climbers over the past seven decades 
an estimated two tons of discarded tents empty oxygen bottles 
tin cans and other garbage littering the flanks of everest will be 
buried in a landfill near the base camp at 17100 feet team 
members said 
whittaker who scaled everest in 1963 and led the first american 
ascent of k2 in 1978 doesnt plan to try for the summit himself 
preferring to leave that bid to younger and stronger climbers 
an essential ingredient to this is that if one climber 
falters climbers from all three countries will turn back said 
warren thompson the expeditions deputy leader its important 
that what we accomplish is accomplished together

the labor party wednesday won a pledge from 
prime minister yitzhak shamir to allow the cabinet to review us 
peace proposals offered at meetings later this week a labor 
official said 
labors leader finance minister shimon peres also said the 
party will quit the coalition government if it rejects a proposal 
for israelipalestinian peace talks 
foreign minister moshe arens is scheduled to stop in washington 
for two days after a visit to mexico he will meet secretary of 
state james a baker iii on friday for a discussion of the stalled 
mideast peace process 
shamir of the rightwing likud bloc ordered that no us ideas 
be immediately rejected a senior labor official said he said 
shamir acted after his coalition partners in the leftofcenter 
labor party expressed fears that arens would reject bakers 
proposals without consulting them the labor official said 
the official said peres and defense minister yitzhak rabin also 
of labor met with shamir on wednesday to tell the premier that 
arens cannot respond in a negative way to bakers proposals 
regarding issues on which there is no cabinet decision 
shamir is to instruct arens he should not reject bakers 
proposals but pass them on to the cabinet the official said 
he said labor leaders were satisfied with the decision as this 
is exactly what they wanted 
shamir aide avi pazner would not confirm that any such specific 
instructions would be given to arens however he said us ideas 
would be passed on to the cabinet 
arens is not going to conduct negotiations there pazner 
said 
baker has proposed a threeway meeting with foreign ministers of 
israel and egypt to discuss the peace process and resolve the 
differences over the makeup of a palestinian delegation for 
proposed israelipalestinian talks 
the meeting would be aimed at reviving an israeli proposal for 
elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip as a first step 
toward peace 
likud and labor are deeply divided over the issue of palestinian 
representation in peace talks labor is ready to give a role to 
palestinian exiles and residents of israeliannexed east jerusalem 
but likud fears that would provide a backdoor entry for the 
palestine liberation organization and put jerusalem on the agenda 
official policy is to refuse to talk to the plo which israel 
considers a terrorist group 
peres said wednesday that labor would leave shamirs government 
and try to form a narrow coalition with religious and leftwing 
parties if the cabinet rejects the efforts to begin 
israelipalestinian talks 
we have to make up our minds clear and now and decisively 
he said it is really a trying moment in the history of the state 
of israel and i believe the coming two or three weeks will be of 
crucial importance in deciding the destiny of our country 
he made the comments in a speech to about 600 delegates to the 
emergency world jewish peace conference in jerusalem

attorney general dick thornburgh approved the 
partial merger of the two daily newspapers in york pa wednesday 
under the antitrust exemption of the newspaper preservation act 
thornburgh accepting the recommendation of the justice 
departments antitrust division approved the plan to merge the 
production and commercial operations of the morning york daily 
record and the evening york dispatch 
thornburgh found that the record qualified for a limited 
antitrust exemption as a failing newspaper because it lagged 
the dispatch in both circulation and advertising revenue 
this record reveals no plausible method by which the record 
could maintain its competitive position and its current revenues 
while continuing to defer longdelayed capital expenditures 
thornburgh said in his opinion 
thornburgh said there did not appear be any alternatives to a 
joint operating agreement that would allow the record to remain 
financially as well as editorially independent of the dispatch 
the record owned by buckner news alliance has a circulation of 
40408 weekdays and 38328 on sundays according to 1988 figures 
that year the dispatch owned by garden state newspapers inc had 
a weekday circulation of 48310 and the companys sunday news had 
a circulation of 42482 
under the joint operating agreement the newspapers will 
maintain separate reporting staffs and publish separate editions 
during the week the record will discontinue its sunday edition but 
will produce its own comment section for insertion into the sunday 
news 
the dispatch will discontinue its saturday afternoon edition

andrei grachev an aide to soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev said wednesday that no one could prevent lithuania 
from seceding from the soviet union if it wants to 
grachev deputy chief of the soviet communist partys 
international department was in paris this week for a series of 
conferences on europe 
he said the future of the three baltic republics lithuania 
estonia and latvia is an open question and should be 
debated and resolved in the soviet parliament 
local elections this weekend in lithuania are expected to test 
the strength of the nationalist movement sajudis 
free debate would convince the citizens of the baltics that 
their future belongs in the federated soviet union with power 
passed on from moscow to the separate republics grachev said 
but if this discussion doesnt convince the lithuanian people 
that their interest is to remain in a renewed federation they make 
the decision and no one can prevent them from fulfilling it 
grachev said 
egor yakovlev editor in chief of the moscow news echoed 
grachevs sentiments at their appearance in a debate held at the 
ecole centrale de paris 
an eventual separation of a baltic republic from the soviet 
union will be less pain from the point of view of progress and 
perestroika than an attempt to keep it by force by tanks he 
said 
lithuania latvia and estonia were independent states between 
world war i and 1940 when they were annexed by the soviet union 
they now seek to obtain at least a measure of autonomy from moscow

an hour after the exxon valdez struck a 
reef causing the nations worst oil spill skipper joseph hazelwood 
said the accident was his fault an exxon official testified 
wednesday 
paul myers now project manager for the 987foot tankers 
repair said he telephoned the ship in the early morning hours of 
march 24 after being told it had run aground he said he reached 
hazelwood who told him oil was in the water and that the ship was 
safe 
what did he tell you had happened asked assistant district 
attrorney brent cole 
he indicated the third mate zigged for ice and it went 
aground said myers he said he wasnt on the bridge 
what else did captain hazelwood say asked the prosecutor 
he indicated it was his fault he was to blame myers 
replied he had just gone down to do some paperwork when this 
happened and he should have been on the bridge 
the witness who said he was testifying under a grant of 
immunity from prosecution said he thought hazelwood felt 
responsible as the ships captain but he was prohibited from 
answering a question from the defense on whether hazelwood was 
accepting criminal responsibility 
the 43yearold former skipper is charged with seconddegree 
criminal mischief a felony and three misdemeanors reckless 
endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent 
discharge of oil 
if convicted his maximum penalties could be 7 years in prison 
plus 61000 in fines 
earlier wednesday another exxon valdez skipper testified that 
hazelwood violated a company operating manual in commanding the 
tanker but acknowledged that broke no laws 
michael stalzer who preceded hazelwood in commanding the ship 
and since has succeeded him as captain told jurors how hazelwood 
acted against the rules set down in exxons bridge manual 
but during crossexamination by hazelwood lawyer dick madson 
stalzer conceded the manual was merely a guideline a statement of 
exxon policies on how to run a tanker 
during his crossexamination stalzer also told jurors for the 
first time that exxon is concerned about the outcome of hazelwoods 
trial 
he said the company which has employed him since 1973 is 
paying for his lawyer as well as for attorneys representing other 
crewmembers who have testified 
i believe exxon does have an interest in the outcome of this 
case he said in response to a question from madson 
during questioning by assistant district attorney cole stalzer 
said he felt the company was interested because hazelwood was its 
employee at the time of the march 24 grounding 
i believe that perhaps the outcome of this case will have an 
effect on some of the other pending litigation he added 
stalzer who said he personally followed the exxon bridge manual 
to the letter described the exxon valdez as the newest and 
probably most technically advanced of all the tankers in exxons 
approximately 30ship fleet 
he also indicated he would have chosen different staffing than 
hazelwood did for a hazardous passage into prince william sound 
hazelwood left the ship in control of the third mate 10 minutes 
before it grounded spilling almost 11 million gallons of oil into 
the clear waters of prince william sound the disaster killed 
countless birds fish and wildlife and blackened hundreds of miles 
of rocky shoreline 
stalzer said he would have followed a section of the manual 
suggesting that the captain an officer and a seaman be on the 
bridge if hazards existed he cited ice in the shipping lanes as a 
hazard but acknowledged that captains have the option to interpret 
the manual as they see fit

the senate energy committee on wednesday 
approved president bushs nomination of a former battelle 
laboratories nuclear waste expert to supervise the governments 
attempt to dispose of radioactive waste from nuclear power plants 
john w bartlett a chemical and nuclear engineer won the 
committees unanimous support to be director of the energy 
departments office of civilian radioactive waste management 
sens richard h bryan and harry reid both dnev had objected 
to bartlett because of a technical paper he presented last year 
asserting that scientific evidence cannot assure with 100 percent 
that any repository site for nculear waste will safely contain the 
wastes for 10000 years 
reid interpreted the paper as evidence that bartlett endorsed 
congress choice of yucca mountain in nevada three years ago for 
the site regardless of the scientific consequences bryan said 
it showed bartlett was blatantly biased against nevada 
however a committee source said wednesday that veiled threats 
by bryan and reid to attempt to block bartletts nomination on the 
senate floor appear to have dissipated 
the waste in question is currently stored at power plants 
nevada is objecting to the federal governments plan to bury it in 
yucca mountain if the geology proves acceptable where it is 
supposed to decay undisturbed for thousands of years 
also approved unanimously by the committee was bushs nomination 
of former ohio coal operator robert h gentile to be an assistant 
secretary in charge of the energy departments fossil fuels program

the aflcio on wednesday urged the bush 
administration to give the soviet union most favored nation status 
which would allow it to benefit from lower trade tariffs 
the executive council of the 141 millionmember federation 
which traditionally has taken a hardline stance toward the soviet 
union said the soviets should receive the best trade treatment 
possible from the united states for a oneyear trial period 
the 33member board said the status should be subject to 
congressional review and conditioned on soviet respect for basic 
worker and human rights 
the status should be granted separately to the soviet republics 
of lithuania latvia and estonia where there are strong 
proindependence movements the aflcio said the united states has 
never recognized the incorporation of those three republics into 
the soviet union 
the aflcio is convinced that reform in the ussr is driven 
primarily by the crisis afflicting the soviet economy the labor 
leaders said 
but they said the soviet eagerness to participate in the world 
economy could be used as a constructive lever to propel the 
process of democratization in the soviet union 
congress prohibited the soviet union from receiving the most 
favored nation trade status in 1974 with the jacksonvanik 
amendment a retaliation for the prohibition of immigration of 
soviet jews and other dissidents 
because of that amendment us tariffs on soviet goods can be 
10 times as high as products from other countries 
soviet immigration policies have eased over the last year and 
president bush has said he would consider granting the improved 
trade status to the soviet union if it liberalizes its immigration 
policies 
at decembers malta summit bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev said they would try to have a new trade treaty ready by 
their scheduled june meeting in washington trade talks between 
both sides began last week 
also wednesday as labor leaders spent much of their closeddoor 
session debating international affairs they offered their harshest 
criticism so far of bushs policy on china following that 
governments bloody crackdown in tiananmen square last summer 
aflcio leaders said bush by vetoing legislation to protect 
chinese students in the united states and sending highlevel 
emissaries to beijing had undermined americas leading position 
in the world as a defender of human rights 
the china statement came as the federations board awarded 
chinese dissident fang lizhi the federations george meany human 
rights award 
aflcio president lane kirkland distributed a letter that lizhi 
who has been in refuge at the us embassy in beijing since july 
sent after learning he would receive the award 
today is a very cold day in beijing the heartening news sent 
from you is like a burning coal to warm both my body and spirit

inc said the through with chew week campaign which begins 
sunday is designed to educate teenagers about the health risks of 
smokeless tobacco including lifethreatening cancers of the mouth 
and throat

smokeless tobacco dr jerome goldstein the academys executive 
vice president told a news conference

tobacco use grew more than fourfold from 1970 to 1986 according 
to the 1989 surgeon generals report on smoking 
the british government has decided to ban oral snuff which is 
powdered tobacco held in one place in the mouth for an extended 
period because of the growing weight of medical and scientific

national federation of state high school associations are 
distributing a 10minute video to all public and private high 
schools the video outlines the social and health risks of

states annually are linked to tobacco said dr roy sessions 
chairman of the department of otolaryngology and head and neck 
surgery at georgetown university medical center in washington 
about 40 percent of people with oral cancer will die from the 
disease within five years of such a diagnosis he said 
he also said studies have shown smokeless tobacco is a more 
difficult habit to kick than smoking

members of a white supremacist group plotted to 
put poison gas into a synagogues air conditioning system as part 
of their hate campaign a former member of the group testified 
wednesday 
the allegation came in early testimony during the trial of five 
skinheads socalled because of their closely shaved heads 
members of a faction called the confederate hammerskins they 
are charged with violating the civil rights of jews by defacing a 
synagogue three are additionally accused of civil rights 
violations by allegedly chasing blacks and hispanics from a dallas 
park 
on trial are sean christian tarrant 20 of dallas jon lance 
jordan 19 of garland michael lewis lawrence 22 of tulsa 
okla christopher barry greer 25 of irving and daniel alvis 
wood 20 of dallas greer tarrant and jordan are charged in the 
park attacks 
a former hammerskin gordon gene buchanan testified wednesday 
that wood had discussed putting cyanide gas in the air conditioning 
system of the temple shalom he said he accompanied jordan tarrant 
and wood to the temple on an august night in 1988 
he said he saw jordan and wood near buildings the air 
conditioning units but could not see what they were doing 
dan l kraus of temple shalom testified a number of the 
synagogues members discussed leaving the congregation after the 
1988 vandalism that included spraypainted antisemitic graffiti 
and gunshots that riddled walls and broke windows

holocaust of nazi germany when millions of jews were gassed in 
concentration camps

wednesday that he was chased from the park by a gang of 12 to 15 
white youths some with closely shaved heads 
the first reaction was fear i was scared i knew what could 
happen if they caught me he said 
prosecutors have said that the skinheads believed the park 
named after a confederate general was a symbol of white supremacy 
that should not have been frequented by nonwhites 
the group had heard that the naacp was seeking to have the park 
renamed in 1988 buchanan said to show their disapproval greer 
suggested that the hammerskins go to the park put up racial 
notices and patrol the area buchanan said 
he said he accompanied the group to the park about five times 
during that summer but buchanan said he got into an argument with 
wood over a girl and was kicked out of the group in september 1988 
leon carter a black attorney representing jordan warned jurors 
not to let emotion overtake them 
there will be things in this trial that will inflame and 
excite you there will be fliers writings on the wall and other 
things that will get your emotions up carter said but once 
you have ridden that crest of emotion i ask you to look closely at 
the case and look to your reason and not emotion 
attorney general richard thornburgh said after the indictments 
were issued in september that prosecution of racial hate crimes is 
a priority of the justice department 
each of the federal charges carries up to 10 years in prison and 
a 250000 fine 
wood already has been sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 
5000 by a state judge after admitting he sprayed swastikas and 
antisemitic slogans at the synagogue 
eleven other hammerskins associates were charged previously 
three out of five adults and four of six juveniles pleaded guilty 
security on the courtroom floor was tighter than usual visitors 
were asked to empty their pockets for inspection

at israels request secretary of state james 
a baker iii will meet friday with foreign minister moshe arens in 
a renewed effort to open mideast negotiations 
the objective is to set up talks between israel and palestinian 
arabs on an israeli election plan for the west bank and gaza 
that has been bakers goal for several months but he has made 
little visible headway the meeting with arens who will come here 
after a visit to mexico was announced wednesday by margaret d 
tutwiler the state department spokeswoman 
she said baker had no immediate plan to hold a similar session 
with egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid but in response 
to questions ms tutwiler said robert pelletreau jr the us 
ambassador to tunisia met tuesday with the palestine liberation 
organization 
ms tutwiler declined to provide any details of the conversation 
the united states opened talks with the plo 14 months ago after 
chairman yasser arafat publicly renounced terrorism and said he 
accepted israels existence 
with arens the spokeswoman said baker obviously will be trying 
to move the process forward and to set up a threeway 
subsequent meeting with meguid 
israel has proposed an election for palestinian arabs on the 
west bank and gaza to chose negotiators to work out a formula for 
limited selfrule in the territories 
the plo opposes prime minister yitzhak shamirs plan as a device 
to block establishment of a palestinian state on israeli land the 
plan has bakers support 
in another development spokeswoman tutwiler said egypt was a 
leading candidate to receive an unspecified number of us m60a1 
tanks that no longer are needed in western europe she said israel 
had turned down a similar opportunity 
pentagon officials said 700 tanks were involved their value 
when new was 14 million apiece or 980 million in all the 
officials said they tanks were being replaced by newer and more 
powerful m1 abrams tanks 
ms tutwilers office said egypt or whoever gets the tanks will 
not have to pay for them but will have to pay transportation costs 
ms tutwiler said the north atlantic treaty organization allies 
and congress would be consulted it was not immediately clear if 
congress would have the power to block transfer of the tanks as it 
would a military sale 
ms tutwiler said egypt would use the tanks to replacing 
sovietbuilt tanks with no net increase in its arsenal of the 
weapons

conservation officials on wednesday said 
they will crack down on desert poachers who smuggle rare animal and 
bird species out of oman for sale 
offenders will face sixmonth jail sentences and fines of up 
to 900 rials for contravening environmental laws conservation 
department spokesman yousuf albaloushi said the fine is 
equivalent to 2320 
he said the action follows the jailing in december of four omani 
tribesmen caught trucking arabian gazelles over the united arab 
emirates border they were convicted under environmental 
legislation banning the hunting of endangered species and are 
serving sixmonth jail terms baloushi said 
he added we believe they were part of an organized gang 
operating in the desert investigations are presently under way to 
find out exactly what has been going on 
baloushi said other prime targets included the nubian ibex and 
the houbara bird known biologically as the macqueens bustard a 
resident breeder the size of a goose 
poachers catch them live and export them to neighboring 
countries where they fetch a good price he said 
it appears there is a ready market for rare species like 
gazelles which are said to fetch around 500 rials 1300 apiece 
for private zoos baloushi said 
he said the arabian white oryx was not threatened this beast 
was extinct in the wild until it was reintroduced to the stony oman 
central desert preserve at yalooni in the jiddat al harasis 
the range wardens in the jiddat are active and the oryx are 
well guarded and protected elsewhere though we are bolstering 
our conservation patrol efforts baloushi said 
if we do not act now it will be too late we are talking here 
about species of animal and bird that are almost extinct existing 
only in oman it is a lobal issue in that respect 
government notices published in the local press on the orders 
of omans ruler sultan qaboos warned that the hunting of rare 
birds deer and other wildlife was prohibited 
the notices said police would maintain strict border 
surveillance to apprehend violators

crackdowns in china and cuba drew strong 
criticism from the state department in its annual human rights 
report to congress on wednesday in contrast to praise for a 
remarkable opening of the political process in the soviet union 
the human rights situation on the west bank and in gaza where 
palestinian arabs are in the 27th month of an uprising against 
israeli control was described as a source of deep concern 
assistant secretary richard schifter the principal compiler of 
the 1641page document contrasted suppression in china with giant 
humanrights advances in eastern europe 
he told a house foreign affairs subcommittee that the crackdown 
on prodemocracy forces in china last year put into reverse in 
very short order much of the significant movement toward a more 
open society which had taken place in china during the last 10 
years 
there was no indication however that the bush administration 
was about to harden its policy toward china which several members 
of congress have likened to kidgloves treatment schifter said the 
united states must maintain ties to beijing in order to bring about 
improvements 
in cuba meanwhile the report said president fidel castro has 
taken or fabricated opportunities to harass detain or imprison 
50 human rights advocates while the marxist government silenced 
many of its leading domestic critics 
the picture in the soviet union was brighter under president 
mikhail s gorbachev the report said the past year witnessed a 
remarkable opening up of the political process and improvements in 
human rights practices 
still the report said the soviet union has a considerable 
distance to go before it will meet the standards set forth in the 
helsinki final act of 1975 a 35nation pledge to foster human 
rights in which moscow joined 
though the top leadership no longer fosters antisemitism and 
appears embarrassed by it there has been a sharp increase in 
popular expressions of antisemitic attitudes the report said 
jews have been increasingly concerned over the danger of 
violence 
schifter in presenting the worldwide findings said the 
specter of totalitarianism is at long last disappearing from 
europe he added as of today albania is the only relic of the 
age of hitler and stalin left intact in europe 
and yet as a whole the report sketched a gloomy globe 
from beheadings and amputations in saudi arabia to student 
detentions in liberia and to disappearances in el salvador the 
document catalogued mans inhumanity to man in virtually every 
conceivable way 
it said 
prodemocracy demonstrators were gunned down in the area of 
beijings tiananmen square last june and independent observers 
were cited as challenging the official toll of 20 executions as 
unrealistically low 
in myanmar formerly burma men forced to walk ahead of army 
troops in mineinfested fields were blown up 
in iran prisoners were flogged and suspended from the ceiling 
according to eyewitnesses and human rights groups 
in iraq effective opposition to government policy was stifled 
and intelligence services engaged in extensive surveillance 
the freedoms of speech and press and of assembly and 
association are virtually nonexistent the report said of iraq 
other important human rights problems include continuing 
disappearances and arbitrary detentions lack of fair trial 
widespread interference with privacy excessive use of force 
against kurdish civilians and an almost total lack of worker 
rights 
israel a democracy came in for little criticism but there was 
concern about the occupied west bank and gaza 
a total of 432 palestinians were reported killed in 1989 304 
by israeli security forces and settlers and 128 by other 
palestinians 
while the israeli defense forces engaged in a severe crackdown 
the report cited a significant increase in palestinian violence 
against palestinians spurred by a growing islamic fundamentalist 
hamas movement 
israeli government guidelines to restrict use of force were 
violated and prosecution resulted only in a relatively small 
number of such incidents the report said 
james zogby executive director of the arab american institute 
called the report a brutal indictment of israeli occupation said 
proisrael groups applied pressure to mute the criticism and said 
congress should either cut the 3 billion in aid to israel or make 
it conditional on an improved record 
sheldon d comay president of the american jewish committee 
noted that only 21 pages of the report dealt with israel and said 
the disproportionate media attention to these pages unwittingly 
attets to the especially high standards by which israel is judged 
in jerusalem moshe raviv the deputy director general of the 
foreign ministry said us criticism of israels handling of 
palestinian human rights failed to take into account that israel 
was reacting to violence by palestinians 
rep gus yatron dpa chairman of the house human rights 
subcommittee complimented the state department for a report that 
pulls no punches in assessing dismal human rights records of such 
dictatorial regimes as china and iraq 
yatron challenged the bush administration to match the rhetoric 
of the annual review with a policy which places americas 
commitment to human rights and democratic institutions above 
offending ruthless regimes which the administration is currently 
seeking to curry favor 
his statement reflected congressional criticism of president 
bush as imposing only limited sanctions against china 
the report found a dramatic deterioration in the human rights 
climate in china in 1989 apart form the beijing crackdown the 
army killed scores of tibetans in march in lhasa and reports of 
torture of persons accused of counterrevolutionary crimes are 
persistent and consistent it said 
james odea director of the washington office of amnesty 
international a worldwide human rights organization said there 
were up to 10000 people in prison and that secret us missions 
and private diplomacy had not improved conditions 
in saudi arabia capital punishment is meted out for a wide 
variety of crimes beheading is the usual method of execution and 
in some cases it was followed by public crucifixion in the first 
10 months of 1989 at least 13 thieves had their hands severed 
including 11 nonsaudis the report says 
nicaraguas sandinista government which faces national 
elections on sunday is sharply criticized for maintaining an 
extensive and repressive internal security apparatus that 
includes surveillance and infiltration of the political opposition

the office of management and budget may not 
block or change government regulations through its power to reduce 
paperwork requirements for private businesses the supreme court 
ruled wednesday 
the decision a victory for labor unions means that employers 
at certain multiemployer job sites must obey rules of the 
occupational safety and health administration requiring notice to 
workers of the dangers of certain consumer products used on the job 
the ombs power over government regulations has been contested 
by congressional committees and advocacy groups especially 
environmentalists for several years but the court said it was not 
ruling on their broad concerns only omb actions under the 
paperwork reduction act of 1980 
on a 72 vote the court held that the act does not give omb 
the authority to review agency rules mandating disclosure by 
regulated entities to third parties in the words of the majority 
opinion by justice william j brennan 
brennan said the court was leaving undecided whether other rules 
might legitimately be subject to omb review 
the dissenters chief justice william h rehnquist and justice 
byron r white dissented said the court should defer to ombs 
interpretation of the law 
the rules at issue were adopted by the occupational safety and 
health administration in 1983 to inform workers about the dangers 
of being exposed to hazardous materials 
the omb an arm of the white house objected four years later 
saying the multiemployer rules were unnecessary to protect 
employees and merely added to employers paperwork 
the united steelworkers union and others sued over the omb 
action and the philadelphiabased 3rd us circuit court of 
appeals ruled that the omb lacked the power to order a substantive 
change in another agencys rules 
wednesdays decision upheld the 3rd circuit ruling 
the justices last may refused to hear appeals by the 
construction and feed grain industries that objected coming under 
regulations for disclosing information on hazardous materials to 
workers 
the 1983 rules originally were imposed only on manufacturers 
but the federal government later was ordered to extend the rules to 
nonmanufacturing businesses 
in 1981 president reagan issued an executive order expanding an 
earlier order by president carter giving omb the power to review 
agency regulations which have the force of law 
reagans order gives omb to the extent not forbidden by law or 
court decisions the power to hold up regulations until agencies 
satisfy omb analysts that what they propose to do will be the most 
costeffective course possible 
in the reagan administration advocacy groups charged the omb 
frequently went beyond its mandate in imposing its views

a federal prosector said wednesday he 
will take legal action against president jose sarney for allowing 
gold miners to stay illegally on yanomami indian lands and 
contributing to the genocide of the tribe 
deputy attorney general carlos mucci told a house session sarney 
and five cabinet ministers were permitting the devastation of the 
yanomamis the worlds largest primitive tribe and so were guilty 
of crimes of responsibility 
in an interview mucci said further the yanomamis situation 
is worse that what is reported the government is contributing to 
the quasigenocide 
despite protests by environmentalists sarney signed a decree on 
friday creating the uraricoera and catrimani mining areas in the 
northwestern jungle state of roraima near the venezuelan border 
the areas totaling about 1 million acres border the 
mineralrich yanomami reserves and are claimed by the tribe 
mucci head of a justice department committee on indian rights 
said sarney violated the constitution and a judicial order by 
giving about 40000 miners two tracts of national park land in 
exchange for the prospectors promise to leave the yanomami reserve 
mucci said only congress could authorize the location of mining 
sites and the type of minerals to be extracted on national forest 
land 
he threatened to bring charges against the ministers of justice 
health interior air force and mines and energy for cosigning the 
decree 
a house vote on the charges is expected this week further 
action would be up to the senate 
when the compromise with the miners was announced last month 
justice department spokesman vinicius becker said this is the 
peaceful solution to the problem there will be no shock or 
confrontation 
sarney a civilian took office in 1985 ending 21 years of 
military rule he will be succeeded by presidentelect fernando 
collor de mello for a fiveyear term on march 15 
there is time for the legislature to adopt a position before 
march 15 it all depends on political will mucci said 
a clandestine gold rush to the yanomami territory began in 1987 
after government studies indicated a wealth of gold tin bauxite 
and diamonds on yanomami land 
since then the prospectors have destroyed rain forests chased 
off fish and game polluted rivers with mercury used in gold 
panning and spread venereal disease and tuberculosis among the 
peaceful tribe 
brazils roman catholic church says at least 1500 yanomamis of 
the 9000member tribe have died of malnutrition malaria and 
venereal diseases since the invasion began 
under international pressure the government last month 
announced a 4 million campaign to expel the prospectors by force 
if necessary 
but shortly after it offered the miners three tracts of virgin 
amazon rain forest near the reserve to avoid a bloodbath with the 
heavily armed miners 
the national indian office says it fears the yanomami tribe 
which once claimed 23 million acres of brazils northwestern amazon 
territory could be wiped out by further intrusions 
over the years the government carved up the yanomamis claim 
leaving them 19 scattered reservations totaling 5 million acres it 
declared the rest national parks and forests 
about 220000 native indians are left in brazil there were an 
estimated 5 million when the portuguese first landed here in 1500 
environmentalists say the miners will spill off into indian 
reservations in neighboring amazon states and decimate other tribes

worlds first recipient of a heartliver transplant spent more 
than nine hours wednesday trying to stop internal bleeding that 
began after her second liver transplant 
a team of surgeons reconstructed a connection they made between 
the donor livers hepatic artery one of the main arteries of the 
liver and stormies hepatic artery part of the connection had 
given way the doctor said 
she had bleeding from one of her suture lines the arterial 
suture line said dr andreas tzakis the surgeon who headed the 
operation we fixed it by reconstructing the arterial blood 
supply to the liver 
stormies second operation in two days began about 850 am and 
ended shortly after 6 pm hospital officials said 
tzakis said he remained optimistic about stormies recovery 
the liver looks good and we expect her to recover promptly he 
said 
during the procedure doctors checked all other possible sources 
of bleeding to try prevent further problems he said internal 
bleeding occurs in about 10 percent of all patients receiving a 
second transplant tzakis said 
doctors suspected internal bleeding when the girls blood 
pressure started dropping about 8 pm tuesday seven hours after 
her transplant ended 
stormie had regained consciousness and was listed in critical 
condition in the hospitals intensive care unit 
she did not appear to be distressed at the news she would 
require more surgery tzakis said 
shes determined to make it no matter what he said 
stormies stepfather alan purcell 27 said the girls attitude 
has helped other members of the family 
how can we get down when she stays up he said during a news 
conference held after wednesdays surgery

worth texas suburb of white settlement needed a new liver her 
first transplanted liver had been permanently damaged by hepatitis 
caused by an unknown virus 
in white settlement stormies classmates at brewer middle 
school were praying wednesday that she would recover said the 
principal homer dear 
the students are thinking shes tough she can handle it 
and shes going to come back to us dear said adding that the 
youngsters were trying to raise money to help pay for stormies 
latest surgery 
stormie had asked for a new liver in november because she was 
tired of problems with her health according to her mother lois 
suzie purcell 33 
symptoms of liver inflammation began to appear as early as four 
months ago but stormie became especially ill two weeks ago 
suffering from weakness jaundice and itchiness her parents said 
her heart remained healthy and was not affected by the hepatitis 
stormies first transplanted liver had shown some evidence of 
rejection in november tzakis said the problem however seemed to 
clear up after doctors began administering fk506 a new 
experimental japanese antirejection drug 
the girl and her family her mother stepfather and her 
16yearold sister misty arrived in pittsburgh for the 
transplant monday evening 
stormie received a new heart and liver at childrens on feb 14 
1984 to control a condition in which her cholesterol level was 10 
times higher than normal her cholesterol levels have since 
decreased to nearly normal tzakis said

of a 4yearold girl who had died in a new york car accident 
before the first transplant stormie suffered two heart attacks 
and underwent two triple coronary bypass operations

los angeles william pounders the judge who presided for three 
years over the mcmartin preschool molestation trial will not take 
charge of the retrial of defendant raymond buckey a superior court 
judge ruled wednesday 
judge michael r hoff ruled that buckeys retrial on 13 child 
molestation counts will be assigned to another judge to be 
identified later a hearing on the matter was scheduled for monday 
pounders had scheduled a new trial for march 9 it was not 
immediately known how his removal would affect that date 
defense attorneys moved for pounders dismissal after he gave 
media interviews following the first trial of buckey and his 
mother peggy mcmartin buckey 
defense counsel danny davis also argued pounders was biased 
because he had disallowed some attorneys fees but hoff in 
reassigning the case did not find pounders was biased toward 
either side 
instead hoff said that pounders posttrial interviews could 
interfere with jury selection for the new proceedings 
the judge knows what he said and what he meant by his remarks 
but would be placed in the impossible position of interpreting what 
the prospective juror thought about those remarks and perhaps the 
judge himself hoff said 
pounders said he concurred with the decision im finally free 
after three years and three months pounders said the only 
problem is i wont see the case through to its conclusion 
in legal papers filed feb 8 pounders said he publicly 
commented on the case so he could defend the judicial system and 
the jurors he said he had denied some of davis legal fees because 
they were excessive 
buckey and his mother were found innocent of 52 counts of child 
molestation and conspiracy the jury deadlocked on the 13 
additional counts involving buckey

wednesday to remove two branch managers from a store at brandeis 
university after more than a week of student boycotts provoked by 
alleged racial harassment 
alan kahn president of the new yorkbased bookstore chain 
agreed to relocate a manager and an assistant manager in the wake 
of allegations that several black students were unduly scrutinized 
while shopping at the campus store 
student activist johnny williams a graduate sociology student 
said he and other demonstrators would abandon their boycott 
wednesday because barnes amp noble has treated our claims with 
concern and fairness and we applaud them for their sincere 
response 
lawrence holcomb also a graduate sociology student spurred the 
boycott with a letter published feb 6 in the independent campus 
newspaper the justice in which he charged the store managers had 
harassed him and his companions and suspected them of theft because 
they were black 
we believe that our experiences have been validated by this 
statement holcomb said at a news conference wednesday until 
we recognize racial harassment for what it is our society will 
continue to believe that there is not a problem

cuba on wednesday accused the united 
states of using the antidrug fight as an excuse for trampling the 
rights of other nations 
speaking at a special un session on narcotics foreign affairs 
minister isidoro malmierca of cuba also said his country supports 
international efforts to halt the illegal drug trade however the 
offensive must focus on reducing consumption and offering economic 
aid to poor countries where the narcotics are produced he said 
we shall support resolutely the international cooperation to 
combat drug trafficking and related activities but at the same 
time we shall be on the alert and oppose any action or mechanism 
which could be used to violate the borders of our nations our 
sovereignty and territorial integrity malmierca said 
he described the us invasion of panama in december and the 
us coast guards firing on a cubanchartered freighter on jan 31 
as two criminal acts under the same pretext the socalled combat 
against drug trafficking 
the united states said it invaded panama to oust military leader 
manuel antonio noriega and bring him back to the united states to 
stand trial on drug charges 
american officials say the us cutter fired on the freighter 
when the crew refused to allow a search of the vessel and us 
authorities suspected it was involved in illegal narcotics 
trafficking no one was reported injured 
the united states does not have to deploy aircraft carriers or 
paratroopers in other countries in order to combat the cultivation 
and transport of that drug to the consumer centers malmierca 
said 
earlier wednesday chinas deputy health minister gu yingqi 
said world efforts to fight drug trafficking must include 
safeguards to protect the sovereignty of all nations 
gu said no country should threaten other countries with force 
even armed invasion under the excuse of fighting drugs or carrying 
out international cooperation for drug control 
he said heightened international efforts to halt the illegal 
drug trade led to recent violations of the rights of some 
countries he was not specific 
britain and pakistan two nations facing mounting problems from 
the illegal drug trade said regional and global attacks on 
trafficking and consumption must be coordinated to end the 
narcotics plague 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd called it a problem of 
nightmare proportions 
pakistani representative kalim dil khan said that despite 
increased efforts to eliminate illegal narcotics production in 
southern asia drug abuse and crimes linked to the illicit trade 
increased there 
khan federal secretary of pakistans narcotics control 
ministry told the session the loss of human lives resulting 
from drug trafficking and abuse is also increasing that shows that 
something has gone wrong somewhere in our global strategy

about 400 people gathered wednesday at the site 
of malcolm xs assassination to mark the 25th anniversary of his 
death and to protest the planned demolition of the building 
the black leader was shot to death feb 21 1965 while giving a 
speech in the audubon ballroom in upper manhattan under a 1987 
agreement by the city the state and columbia university the badly 
deteriorated structure will be torn down to make way for the 
universitys biotechnology research building 
in its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s the ballroom was a 
showcase for big bands 
it is a very historical site for the black community said 
colette pean of the group which organized wednesdays rally 
twentyfive years after malcolms death his message of 
selfdetermination for black people is now more important than 
ever 
columbia says it has worked closely with the local community 
which is largely hispanic in developing the biotechnology project 
and consulted with leaders of the black community including 
malcolm xs widow dr betty shabazz about what might be the most 
fitting memorial 
bernhard haeckel columbias director of project development 
said the conclusion was that a proper show of respect for malcolm 
xs legacy is one that would be forwardlooking rather than 
nostalgic 
columbia hopes the 25 million audubon research building will be 
a focus for industrialuniversity cooperation bringing discoveries 
in medical research out of the laboratory and into regular use the 
school also says an expected 300 permanent new jobs and planned 
jobtraining can help the economically distressed neighborhood 
those benefits in addition to a scholarship fund for minority 
students in malcolm xs name at columbias nearby medical school 
will do more for the black leaders legacy than pouring precious 
funds into restoring the place of his death haeckel said

and a medical provider in texas will pay 2 million to settle 
charges they defrauded medicare of 21 million the department of 
justice announced wednesday

done by hospital technicians a statement from the justice 
department said 
victory memorial hospital of the new york city borough of 
brooklyn and two manhattan hospitals also submitted claims for

50 percent kickback from cp rehab for every testing receipt the 
hospital provided the justice department said 
the procedures medicare was billed for arterial punctures are 
performed to measure arterial blood gases said michael robinson a 
spokesman for the justice department

plans to reopen beaches fouled by 400000 
gallons of crude oil were set back wednesday when cleanup officials 
reported that more oil may have seeped into the sand than 
previously believed 
unusual tides during a feb 13 storm may have washed thin layers 
of oil above the normal hightide line along 6 miles of beach 
british petroleum america announced 
the storms winds also shifted sands that may have concealed oil 
deposits british petroleum spokesman jim marino said the oil 
company operates the tanker american trader and is directing 
cleanup efforts 
initial findings indicate oil may have seeped between four and 
six inches into the sand from huntington beach pier to 18th street 
in newport beach 
british petroleum officials met with coast guard officers to 
discuss a survey of the affected coastline and if more oil is 
found how to recover it marino said 
the worst case scenario would be to prematurely open the 
beaches and have people go down and get oil on themselves he 
said were using an abundance of caution 
it will delay it reopening beaches definitely said coast 
guard petty officer tim rowe 
however newport beach fire capt ray pendleton said surface 
cleanup had gone so well on another section from the newport pier 
to 18th street that the beachn could be opened thursday 
no date for reopening other beaches closed by the feb 7 tanker 
spill had been set wednesday a total of 3 miles of affected beach

a man was arrested for trying to extort 
2500 from a federal judge when he picked up a package delivered 
to a park by an fbi agent posing as the judge authorities said 
wednesday 
scott wolf 20 was accused of trying to extort money from us 
district judge frank magill of fargo who sits on the 8th us 
circuit court of appeals 
wolf was arrested tuesday night after he retrieved a package 
delivered to a fargo baseball field by fbi special agent kenneth 
aldridge who was posing as the judge in a court affidavit 
released wednesday aldridge said wolf admitted the extortion 
attempt 
wolf told me that he typed the two magill extortion letters 
and later called the judge and attempted to gain money from the 
judge aldridges affidavit said 
he further told me that he acted alone and took actions 
against the judge because he needed money aldridge said 
magill declined comment wednesday said john garry one of the 
judges law clerks but the fbi said wolf may have tried to extort 
money from the judge because he was acquainted with magill 
mr wolf resided at one time in the neighborhood with the 
magill family and theres reason to believe that he has known the 
magill family for a number of years fbi agent perry smith told 
reporters 
wolf appeared wednesday before us magistrate karen klein who 
said he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community and 
released him without bail 
aldridges affidavit said magill received the first of two 
extortion letters on feb 4 while attending judicial meetings in 
florida the letter was postmarked fargo and was addressed to 
magill and his wife mary 
the fbi agent said magill was told in the letter that certain 
fatal and painful actions will be taken against the magill family 
unless he put 2500 in a business envelope and placed it on home 
plate at a baseball diamond 
fbi agents delivered a package to the baseball diamond on feb 
7 but no one picked up the package aldridge said 
a second letter which magill found saturday repeated the 
demand 
you had better take us serious about this money because we 
want it and we want it now the letter said as summarized in 
aldridges affidavit 
aldridge said mcgill also received telephone calls saturday and 
tuesday the caller hung up when the phone was answered but the 
calls later were traced to wolfs residence

president daniel ortega told a 
campaignclosing rally of about 300000 supporters that a 
sandinista victory in sundays elections would win us respect for 
nicaragua after a decade of contempt 
it is a respect that has been won with blood he declared on 
wednesday night 
we expect the united states will have the wisdom to establish 
a respectful relationship with nicaragua 
ortega was elated by the immense throng jumping and waving to 
the crowd as he arrived on a truck 
by law all campaigning by the 10 parties competing in the 
election had to end by wednesday midnight 
the crowd was one of the largest in nicaraguan history 
comparable in size to the one that greeted pope john paul ii in 
1983 
streams of people flowed through town buying food and drink 
from vendors and dancing to rock tropical music reggae and 
smalltown brass bands along the streets 
ortega told his supporters the us government should establish 
respectful relations with nicaragua the same as it does with 
the soviet union without conditions of any type 
ortegas main challenger for the presidency is violeta barrios 
de chamorro of the united national opposition a coalition known 
as uno of 14 parties and one native indian organization 
the election is seen as a referendum on 10 years of sandinista 
rule 
voters will choose a president and vicepresident a 90member 
national assembly municipal councils for 144 towns and two 
regional councils for the atlantic coast 
ortega referred again and again to the opposition as gnuno 
uniting the initials of dictator anastasio somozas national guard 
with those of the opposition 
he equated the opposition with the somoza dictatorship and the 
ussupported contra rebels who have waged civil war here since 
1981 
we will present them with a complete bill ortega said of 
the opposition using a line that has become a catchphrase for 
both sides in the campaign 
but then he struck a conciliatory note by saying that the 
oppositions debt would be forgiven 
we do not need to exchange an eye for an eye nor a tooth for a 
tooth because they are already knocked out they are already on the 
canvas the count has reached 20 and they cant get up 
the sandinistas came to power in 1979 by ousting somoza who was 
later assassinated in exile and ended 40 years of authoritarian 
somoza family rule 
ortega blasted uno for receiving us aid saying millions of 
yankee dollars could not buy the people of nicaragua 
he said nicaragua would not be affected by perestroika the 
soviet restructuring and the reforms sweeping eastern europe 
here we dont follow the communist model or the capitalist 
model we follow the sandinista model 
many supporters began gathering before dawn 
the sandinistas have made a point of appealing to the young and 
the crowd reflected that 
nearly everyone under 25 wore a yellow red black or white 
daniel presidente tshirt older folks sported redandblack 
party baseball caps 
we have lots of reasons to be for the revolution before we 
were on the margin today we have a voice and a vote said ramon 
murillo lopez 48 a poor peasant from boaca 60 miles east of 
managua 
ortegas speech began hours late after dark and tens of 
thousands were already leaving the plaza before he spoke 
we saw him already were satisfied thats why we came 
said eleanor bonilla 27 she said her bus from nandaime 30 miles 
away was parked far from the plaza and she didnt want to miss her 
ride home 
ortega claimed a crowd of 500000 but experienced observers 
estimated it at about 300000 still almost five times what mrs 
chamorro drew at her closing rally sunday 
we are here to support the revolution and defeat violeta and 
her contra friends said tomas alvarado one of about 250 
disabled veterans of the war against the contras 
alvarado said bitterly he had been unable to walk since aug 1 
1983 when he was blasted by a contra grenade he said he and 22 
other paraplegic veterans wheeled their way to managua on a 17day 
160mile trek from the honduran border town of el espino 
despite a huge campaign effort and opinion polls that generally 
give ortega the lead uncertainty about the outcome lingered 
many of nicaraguas 175 million registered voters are reluctant 
to speak their minds to strangers and the large sandinista rallies 
appeared padded by public employees and others pressured to attend 
uno closed its campaign sunday with the largest opposition rally 
since the sandinistas took power in july 1979 gathering 60000 
people at the plaza of the revolution 
wednesday also was the 56th anniversary of the assassination of 
gen augusto cesar sandino a nationalist hero for whom the 
sandinistas are named 
observers from the organization of american states the united 
nations and other groups notably former president jimmy carters 
council of freely elected heads of government will field 1500 
observers to watch the process at 4394 polling places nationwide 
on tuesday mrs chamorro said she would call ortega to 
congratulate him if he won and challenged him to make the same 
commitment 
the sandinistas have said they would turn over the government to 
mrs chamorro in the hypothetical event of a loss but not 
necessarily the armed forces or the police 
in tegucigalpa honduras the contras pledged to avoid any 
military action that would interfere in sundays elections 
contra spokesman alejandro acevedo aid that if the election was 
fair and the sandinistas win the contras would have to enter a 
period of reevaluation

the rights of endangered children sometimes 
outweigh an adults right against selfincrimination the us 
supreme court ruled in the case of a mother jailed for refusing to

the court ruled 72 tuesday that jacqueline bouknight of

tell authorities where her 3yearold son maurice can be found 
social service workers fear the boy is dead 
the bottom line is the court is following an equation that 
says if we think its important enough individual rights have to 
give way here we think the rights of children the concern for 
children is important enough said mary cheh professor of

down a narrow street patrolled by scrawny alley 
cats beside a chicken market and up a flight of tenement stairs a 
little school with a big name is striving to keep the spirit of 
democracy alive in hong kong 
its the overseas campus of tiananmen democracy university and 
it looks ahead to 1997 when china takes over hong kong from the 
british 
its a struggle to interest people in the future of hong 
kong says lau kin chi one of the halfdozen lecturers from hong 
kongs colleges who banded together to form the school most have 
no hope theyd rather spend the time applying to emigrate 
the plight of the school encapsulates the peculiar situation of 
this bustling colony of 57 million people many realize their fate 
is tied to beijing in seven years but few believe they can do 
anything to change the increasingly hardline regime in china 
but a month after the schools opening it is falling on hard 
times 
only 170 people enrolled in january for the first two months of 
courses on democracy chinese politics and the the historic changes 
in eastern europe and the soviet union even fewer are expected for 
the next session 
on a recent night a dozen students sat in the schools sparse 
classroom as the sounds of vegetable hawkers echoed in the alley 
below 
university students computer programmers workers and teachers 
all of them praised the little school but bemoaned its shrinking 
enrollment 
most of my friends are too busy making money or trying to 
leave hong kong to think about china said andrew yeung a 
27yearold computer programmer who comes every tuesday night to 
learn about chinese political movements but i dont want to 
leave hong kong its my home 
call us economic animals said his classmate cheng yeung 
a 35yearold construction foreman but i have no hope of leaving 
so i must learn about china todays beijing is tomorrows hong 
kong 
one high school teacher said she came to class because her 
students were asking questions about china and she didnt know the 
answers a church worker said she needed the class because she 
wanted to understand why the communist chinese arrested roman 
catholics 
i dont worry about the future she said my fate is in 
gods hands 
the school takes its name from tiananmen democracy university 
founded by chinese students and intellectuals in tiananmen square 
just hours before the bloody june 4 crackdown on the movement for 
freedom in beijing 
lau and her colleagues decided to borrow the name and rented out 
two cramped rooms in a fivestory rundown tenement on bustling 
stone nullah lane friends renovated and painted the rooms built 
plywood desks and a printing shop donated mimeograph services 
the schools purpose is to teach about modern china democracy 
and political change topics that are generally ignored by the 
colonys governmentrun educational system for 100 hong kong 
dollars 1280 students can enroll in a twomonth course 
we want to raise peoples consciousness said ms lau who 
teaches and translates modern chinese literature at a local 
college we have been ignorant of china for too long 
indeed modern chinese history after the 1949 communist 
revolution is not taught in hong kongs secondary schools in 
addition an education ordinance bans discussion of all politics in 
high school 
political activism in general also has a bad name in the colony 
where many are refugees from war and communism 
we have a culture of apathy said yueng sum a hong kong 
politician and a leader in the small prodemocracy movement 
politics has always been a dirty word in hong kong its meant 
chaos not freedom 
changes in this perspective began last june and lau and her 
colleagues hope this bodes well for the school 
chinas movement for freedom sparked millions to flood hong 
kongs streets in an unprecedented show of solidarity with the 
student democracy movement on the mainland but beijings crackdown 
also convinced many that china could not be trusted to maintain 
hong kongs freewheeling economic and social system after it 
assumes control of the territory china has promised to allow hong 
kong to maintain its current economic and social systems for 50 
years beyond 1997 
since june 4 the rush to emigrate which already hovers at 
around 1000 people a week appears to have accelerated but the 
crackdown in beijing also sparked increased awareness of chinese 
affairs 
several informal surveys of young people in hong kong after june 
found them increasingly interested in politics and ready to 
participate in movements said stephen lw tang a sociologist at 
the chinese university of hong kong 
for the first time words like democracy and freedom were more 
common than salary and benefits tang said 
back on stone nullah lane theres little to do but wait and see 
its frustrating said cheng yukshing another lecturer at 
the school but our neighbors only talk to us when we dont shut 
the gate

its lunchtime at king davids 
delicatessen and the customers some wearing yarmulkes are 
ordering tongue sandwiches briskets or pastrami 
a few doors down young people in jeans and tshirts get the 
spinach salad special at dont say sandwich to me and nearby 
spanishspeaking youths are buying pan con bistec and cerveza 
fria meat sandwiches and cold beer 
for every kosher restaurant on todays south miami beach the 
socalled jewish riviera theres a fern bar or a counter 
restaurant featuring cuban or nicaraguan standards 
the jewish population is sharply declining on the famed 
41blocklong stretch spurred by an increase in latin exiles 
modern phenomena such as condominiums marielitos and yuppies and 
that most ancient earthly problem mortality 
when i first came here this building was 99 percent jewish 
said rita sors 65 a polishborn holocaust survivor many left 
or of course people die they were replaced by latinamerican 
people 
mrs sors who bought her beachfront condominium in 1980 after 
living in venezuela for more than two decades speaks spanish and 
adjusted more easily to the change from liebman to lopez than many 
other jewish retirees 
if your neighbors names all used to be rachel and isidore and 
now theyre jose pedro and maria and they dont speak your 
language people get nervous said ira sheskin a university of 
miami geography professor who chronicles the movements of the 
jewish population in south florida for various jewish groups and 
his florida jewish demography newsletter 
from a peak of an estimated 290000 jews in 1975 dade county 
now is down to 225000 miami beach is down to 58000 of an 
overall city population of about 100000 from 82000 in 1982 
said sheskin who conducts random telephone surveys and counts 
traditional jewish names in city directories to track the 
population 
while there are varied reasons for the change a catalyst came 
in 1980 when cuban president fidel castro opened the port of 
mariel to people who wanted to leave 
among the 125000 cubans who came to this country were thousands 
of vagrants criminals and other misfits unwanted by castros 
revolution most of the marielitos headed to the miami area 
joining a halfmillion earlier cuban refugees some without 
relatives to join moved into south beach crowding into lowrent 
rundown apartments 
muggings purse snatchings and smashandgrab burglaries shot up 
on the beach with elderly retirees vulnerable victims 
they pushed out a lot of the old people said abe resnick a 
city commissioner and russian immigrant they really scared them 
away 
police responded by increasing street units and city officials 
beefed up enforcement of housing codes to reduce the number of 
people sharing lowrent apartments 
ambitious redevelopment of the beach followed and the beach 
population has become younger and less jewish in the last decade 
up to 40 percent of the new residents have been hispanic and the 
median age has dropped from 67 in 1982 to the low 50s 
resnick now 65 has lived in miami beach since 1960 
it was a very interesting life for jewish people he said 
there was everything catering to this type of life cultural 
events theaters people gathering to speak yiddish together the 
synagogues used to be so crowded they had to bring in chairs 
sheskin whos working on a history of jews in south florida 
noted the irony of the latin influx causing jews to leave an area 
that in the 1930s and 40s had antisemitic traditions hotels had 
restricted clientele and some restaurants posted cruel signs 
no jews or dogs 
new yorkraised soldiers stationed in the area during world war 
ii fell in love with the beach and began the huge migration here 
from the northeast along with european jews drawn to a land of 
sun sand and fun 
in 1940 there were 8000 jews in dade county sheskin said by 
1950 there were 55000 and in 1955 the number reached 100000 
but the jet age opening up destinations in the caribbean and 
south dulled some of the beachs glamour and the advent of 
planned condominium retirement communities began siphoning away its 
population 
many retirees simply died off or were priced out by the 
redevelopment that lured the young urban professionals discovering 
trendiness in the funky art deco buildings and a chance to live 
near the water 
the beach that once featured manhattan or las vegasstyle 
nightclub acts now is dotted with youth spots such as club nu or 
penrods on the beach offering lambada nights or rock bands 
three of 10 synagogues on south beach have closed in recent 
years and kosher butchers and jewish bookstores have moved north 
little by little its disappearing resnick said 
at torah treasures there still is good business for editions of 
the talmud israeli newspapers menorahs cassettes such as 
mordechai ben david singing moshiach is coming soon and treats 
for children such as rabbi trading cards mitsvah gum and the board 
game kosherland modeled after candyland 
but coowner aryeh zak here for 15 years said the changes on 
the street are many people use his backdoor as a toilet criminals 
plague him and in general people are not as friendly or polite 
zak said but i think thats a change all over he said 
many of his customers no longer live within walking distance 
but come from the broward and palm beach county suburbs now home to 
most of south floridas jews 
while the shift from south beach has been dramatic the overall 
jewish population in south florida has been increasing sheskin 
said some 650000 jews live in the threecounty palm 
beachbrowarddade area today he said compared to 550000 in 1980 
they represent 17 percent of the threecounty population more 
than the new york area with 12 percent or 22 million jews 
making up the nations mostconcentrated jewish population some of 
the latins are jewish too and sheskin estimates about 10000 
cuban jews or jewbans as theyre called live in south 
florida 
and miami beach still attracts new jewish migrants although 
many familes settle in whats known as middle beach north of 
41st street 
i see a rebirth of miami beach in the sense that so many young 
people and families are moving in said rabbi irving lehrman of 
temple emanuel weve lost a lot of people who passed away but 
weve gained a lot of young people 
if the beach loses its jewish identity its not a tragedy some 
say 
theres nothing sacred about south beach said rabbi tibor 
stern preparing to move his synagogue after 25 years to a 
community to the north its not jerusalem

jesse jacksons new hometown may have a job 
opening made to order for a once and future democratic presidential 
candidate but the fine print says he cant run for it another 
slot almost as inviting is tied up in the city council 
neither job is mayor the office jackson could seek in november 
an option on which he so far wont say yes or no 
the other posts involve congress one officially as a nonvoting 
delegate one unofficially as an cityelected lobbyist for 
district of columbia statehood either would carry some of the 
advantages of office without the confining duties an elected post 
like mayor usually entails 
there has been speculation about jackson for mayor ever since he 
moved to washington last summer and he has done nothing to dampen 
it thats true to the form he has shown in national democratic 
politics jackson strengthened his influence by stirring political 
guesswork about his postconvention roles in the 1984 and 1988 
democratic presidential campaigns 
transplanted from chicago to the district of columbia hes got 
them guessing again this time in local politics there are other 
players among them walter e fauntroy the district nonvoting 
delegate to congress since 1971 
with mayor marion barry in a rehabilitation center and facing 
drug possession and perjury charges some of his leading supporters 
have formed a committee to draft fauntroy for mayor four democrats 
already are running to oust barry but none has the name 
recognition that either fauntroy or jackson would command 
fauntroy says he is agonizing about the decision and will 
announce by march 3 whether hell run for mayor or stay in 
congress where he cant vote but has the other rights of a member 
should he run for mayor it would create what seems the perfect 
vacancy for jackson a seat in congress with a staff committee 
assignments and the right to speak and debate on the floor like any 
other member even the lack of a vote would be an asset missing 
house action while campaigning nationally or tending to other 
interests wouldnt be the recorded disadvantage it sometimes has 
been for members of congress seeking presidential nomination 
and jackson has said that if he did become mayor it would limit 
his activities in national and international affairs 
the hitch is in the law that grants the district a delegate and 
requires that on the date of his election he has resided in the 
district of columbia continuously since the beginning of the 
threeyear period ending on such date 
jackson moved to washington in summer 1989 in time to meet the 
oneyear residency requirement to run for mayor but far short of 
the threeyear rule for delegate that law could be changed by the 
city and congress that means some potential jackson rivals local 
in 1990 national in 1992 would have to go along the law also 
could be challenged as invalid since it doesnt apply to 
congressmen elsewhere and the house itself has the last word on its 
members 
there seemed to be another option in the planned election of a 
shadow congressional delegation by district voters but that has 
been shelved indefinitely by a city council committee the plan was 
to have the voters elect two shadow senators and a representative 
this year as part of the effort to make the district of columbia 
the 51st state they wouldnt be seated in congress of course 
they would be cast as leading lobbyists for statehood a cause for 
which jackson has been campaigning 
creation of those positions which would cost an estimated 135 
million a year was approved in a city referendum on statehood a 
decade ago the elections already have been postponed three times 
statehood always has been a long shot and the barryinduced 
political turmoil makes it even more so congress approved a 
constitutional amendment to give the district voting representation 
in 1978 but it died for lack of state ratification 
seventynine percent of district voters are registered 
democrats only 9 percent are registered as republicans so 
statehood if it came would give the democrats a lock on two new 
seats in the senate and one in the house a prospect republicans 
are not about to accept 
and thats not the only problem that goes with jacksons new 
voting address fauntroy has announced a campaign of 
taxwithholding civil disobedience saying district residents 
should refuse to pay their federal income taxes until they get 
statehood 
that would risk penalties including imprisonment those of us 
who have decided to take this action are prepared to accept those 
consequences fauntroy said last week 
perhaps but if there really is such a statehood campaign it 
would create a special dilemma for jackson who would have to 
choose between local and national objectives tax disobedience 
might play well in the district of columbia but it could be 
disastrous in any future presidential campaign

outside this drowsy town a 
hodgepodge of huts overgrown with rambling purple creepers is all 
thats left of the camp of slow death once the most feared 
prison of portugals african empire 
in those days it housed hundreds of portuguese and african 
dissidents in a myriad of cramped cells 
but todays independent government would like to turn it into a 
museum with beachside bungalows nearby to attract tourists and 
their money to this barren 10island archipelago in the atlantic 
off northwest africa 
it is part of cape verdes turn off the marxistsocialist road 
taken after independence in 1975 into freemarket square 
cape verdes leaders have introduced sweeping economic reforms 
and are even debating scrapping their guaranteed monopoly on power 
we have no abstract model no preconceived ideas prime 
minister pedro pires said sitting in his modest office in cidade 
da praia the capital were trying a pragmatic and gradual 
search for a better life 
the search includes tourism fishing and light manufacturing 
and perhaps investment from cape verdeans who emigrated over the 
years and now live in affluence in such places as the us east 
coast 
the governing african party for cape verdian independence 
decided just over a year ago to remove state controls from all 
sectors save the central bank and offer tax breaks to attract 
foreign capital 
the economy has been prudently managed but the only avenue 
out of chronic dependency is to become a sort of singapore or 
mauritius said tom luche director of us agency for 
international development in cidade da praia singapore and 
mauritius are dutyfree zones 
this place is small and theres a considerable amount of 
private cash here it only needs a couple of sectors to work 
well 
luche estimates cape verdes fishermen could triple their 
current 10000ton annual catch and improve canning and freezing 
installations for tuna and other fish which already account for 
about 70 percent of exports 
in addition to tarrafal another tourist prospect is sal island 
120 miles to the north where stready winds potent rum and cheap 
lobster already attract the ritzy european windsurfing set 
the government plans 10 new luxury hotels in the islands over 
the next 10 years boosting capacity by 2500 rooms 
but island life remains tough for most of the 360000 cape 
verdians who still live here 385 miles off senegal in africas 
sahel region 
with few natural resources other than rich fishing waters the 
archipelago relies on foreign aid for 90 percent of its food 
requirements 
famine killed an estimated 250000 islanders from 1747 to 1960 
and violent storms that ended a 16year dry period in 1984 washed 
out corn and wheat crops 
last year when rain fell for only minutes vegetables were so 
scarce that onions were sold by the slice and fetched twice the 
price of lobster 
most rural housewives have miles to walk for water their neat 
pastelpainted houses have no electricity 
still cape verdes per capita gross national product of 530 
lands it in the world banks middleincome class comparable to 
senegal and one rung up the development ladder from countries like 
kenya and indonesia 
but gnp is propped some 30 percent by foreign aid and 
remittances from an estimated 700000 cape verdians living and 
working abroad mainly on the us east coast portugal france 
the netherlands and several african countries 
in the 1800s many cape verde whalers settled in massachusetts 
and rhode island where today they number more than 350000 
they read their own newspaper the cape verdian and send 
money and goods regularly to families and friends back home 
were still not in condition to stop emigration but more and 
more emigrants are investing here following the new regulations 
said president aristides pereira 
besides financial incentives designed to tap exiles cash 
resources the government is also wooing them with talk of 
political pluralism 
next year independent candidates will be allowed to run in the 
firstever nationwide municipal vote 
we dont exclude the possibility of various parties but it 
really wasnt necessary until now a genuine pluralism of ideas 
exists within the party already said pereira who enjoys 
widespread popular support

many parents who must reckon with the socalled 
kiddie tax have a new choice in how they handle it when they 
file their returns for 1989 
they can as before complete separate federal income tax 
returns for each of their offspring who must file or in some 
cases they may be allowed for the first time to incorporate the 
childrens income on their own tax returns 
the difference may sound like no big deal the main intent of 
the change was to make filing a little easier by eliminating the 
need for separate returns from children in relatively simple 
circumstances 
but experts on the subject say a decision for either option 
should be made with care since it could affect a familys overall 
tax bill 
the kiddie tax was born with the 1986 tax reform law which 
sought to curtail the popular practice of reducing taxes by 
shifting income to children and other dependents 
henceforth the law decreed investment income received by 
youngsters under age 14 would be taxed at their parents tax rate 
once it exceeded specified limits 
this immediately transformed a good many small children into 
fullblown socialsecuritycardcarrying taxpayers it turned out 
however that hardly anybody not even the internal revenue 
service was entirely happy about all the extra paperwork 
engendered by the change 
so was born the new option for parents of a child under 14 who 
has income of between 500 and 5000 derived entirely from 
interest and dividends on which no estimated tax or withholding 
has been paid 
whichever filing method you choose a child in this situation 
owes no tax on the first 500 of earnings the next 500 is taxed 
at a 15 percent rate 
past 1000 the money is taxed at the parents top rate which 
in many cases is 28 percent 
if sheer convenience were the only influencing factor a parent 
might logically prefer the election not to file a separate return 
for the child 
but as specialists on tax matters point out there may be other 
considerations that tip the scales either way 
for one thing including the income on your own return prevents 
you from deducting any expenses that children could claim if they 
filed separately 
conversely says the accounting firm of kmpg peat marwick by 
including your childs investment income on your return you may be 
able to deduct more investment interest expense because of your 
childs investment income this could effectively shelter a portion 
of your childs income from tax 
in addition lumping childrens income with parents can create 
complications for highincome taxpayers who may be subject to the 
alternative minimum tax 
still another possible side effect including your childs 
income on your return may also increase your adjusted gross income 
for purposes of the medical and miscellaneous itemized 
deductions cautions price waterhouse in the current edition of 
its book personal tax advisor 
medical costs and miscellaneous expenses for such things as 
professional dues and uniforms you buy can be deducted only when 
they exceed specified percentages of your gross income 
so if you increase your gross income by including what the child 
earned you may reduce the medical or miscellaneous deductions you 
can take

strip away weather factors in the consumer price 
index and you still have a serious problem an inflation rate of 
more than 7 percent a year that is core inflation 
if maintained it would halve the purchasing power of a dollar 
within 10 years it is a rate high enough to feed itself to 
trigger costofliving pay increases higher interest rates and 
anticipatory buying 
but significant elements in the latest cpi reading make it 
difficult to compare with readings in other decades some of these 
differences might darken the picture but others conceivably have a 
brighter hue 
the dark side 
the increase in energy prices is believed by many analysts to 
be a shortlived phenomenon caused largely by unusually cold 
temperatures in december since then most northern states have 
been warmer than normal 
nonetheless some economists fear higher energy costs will be 
with us for a long time good weather or bad the country has 
abandoned many fuelsaving efforts domestic production is 
declining 
in addition nobody controls weather who can prove that the 
rest of the winter and on into spring will not be colder and 
snowier than normal raising energy demands forcing up food prices 
and snarling transportation 
much of the inflation is in services where costsavings are 
often difficult to find some services such as hotels restaurants 
and hospitals are laborintensive and will be hurt further by 
higher minimum wage rates 
the service sector is growing in fact the economy these days 
is often referred to as a service economy most older industries 
are primarily goods producers 
there is a suspicion that price competition in transportation 
isnt what it used to be when airlines were deregulated for 
example it was expected that competition would drive down fares 
to some extent that happened more recently some airlines have 
been operating on the fringe of profitability and others on the 
fringe of failure it leads some analysts to believe an upward 
price trend is inevitable 
the brighter side 
chonologically most of winter is over temperatures should 
rise from now until summer helping to slow food and energy price 
increases but dont forget averages include extremes weather is 
often extreme 
construction price increases contributed to the big jump in 
january consumer prices that too might be temporary it occurs 
almost every january when contractors bid on jobs to be undertaken 
during the busy summer 
price increases in services are not always what they seem they 
cannot always be measured accurately in fact some increases are 
unreal reported mainly because methodology has failed to keep 
abreast of change 
increases in productivity for example are seldom fully 
measured it is much more difficult to measure service output than 
it is in the production of goods especially manufactured items 
how do you measure the quality the productivity of health care 
how do you work that into inflation equations can you compare a 
modern fastfood outlet with an old diner 
economist william dunkelberg dean of temple university school 
of business and management puts it colorfully although rather 
theoretically 
your doctors fee might have doubled but most likely you are 
getting better health care too youre probably getting more 
pounds of health care for the dollar that is the cost of a pound 
of health care might have dropped 
then we might assume that some of service inflation isnt real 
it isnt an assumption said dunkelberg it is a fact

in a bare concrete back room at the lowell thomas 
law building theres a picture of thomas labeled simply thomas 
with a man 
the man consigned to oblivion is tv personality arthur godfrey 
now thomas himself is facing that same forgotten fate 
we have students here at denver university who dont know who 
lowell thomas was said phil gauthier 63 head of the alumni 
association and unofficial curator of the lowell thomas memorabilia 
the school which has 975 students has no money and no room for 
the museum gauthier would like to build in memory of the man who 
chronicled history for four generations toured the world and 
crossed both poles befriended presidents wrote more than 50 books 
and was a pioneer in broadcast journalism 
gauthier says thomas also was a frustrated lawyer who left his 
35 million estate in pawling ny to the school to build a 
library in his memory gauthier would like to put up a museum 
featuring video presentations of thomas career and displaying some 
of the 2600 books and 700 photos left to the university 
the mementos are now kept in a locked barewall concrete room 
in the building he sponsored on the university of denver law 
campus formerly colorado womens college there are no displays 
open to the public 
thomas grew up in colorado and fondly remembered the state his 
father became the doctor in victor colo and thomas went to work 
in the gold mines at the age of 11 he often bragged he was raised 
in an ore house 
at 19 he became editor of the local paper the victor daily 
news his memories of one day at the paper were vivid as recalled 
in a may 14 1951 interview with the denver post 
on saturday there was no pretty girl picture available so i 
ran a story about a brawl in denver in which the nephew of our 
mayor was involved to supply the needed art i used the mayors 
picture he came looking for me with a gun and i apologized 
sincerely and quickly 
after a newspaper war with his rival the late gov ralph carr 
thomas left victor and went on to international fame 
i dont know who won but i left he said 
in denver he attended the university of denver and got his 
bachelors degree in 1913 
he then left colorado for a chicago newspaper job and went 
overseas to cover world war i there he sealed his fame and fortune 
when he discovered lawrence of arabia thomas edward shaw 
lawrence who was at the time taking up his cudgel against the 
turks on the arabian peninsula 
in 1930 he went into broadcasting finding a career that last 
nearly half a century he began the first regularly scheduled radio 
newscast on cbs radio and made the first television newscast in 
1939 he also was host of a public television series called 
lowell thomas remembers 
when he started his career eric sevareid was 13 walter 
cronkite 9 harry reasoner 2 
he always began his broadcast saying good evening 
everybody and ended his show with his trademark so long 
until tomorrow except when he retired may 14 1976 and he said 
simply so long 
he died at his home in pawling in 1981 at the age of 89 
among the items at the university of denver are the entire 
collection of radio scripts from his first broadcast in october 
1930 to his last in may 1976 
gauthier said very few people visit the faculty lounge where the 
volumes are kept and those who do want to find out what happened 
the day they were born 
not everything thomas touched turned to gold gauthier said 
thomas was particularly disappointed with the lack of success of 
cinerama a movie technique he helped perfect 
cinerama never did take off to the extent he thought it would 
but it was a forerunner of bigscreen movies gauthier said 
among the collection stored in the back room are pictures of 
thomas with franklin roosevelt dwight eisenhower jawaharal nehru 
in new delhi chiang kaishek gen douglas macarthur in tokyo 
herbert hoover cannibals in the new guinea jungle jack dempsey 
lawrence of arabia gen george patton and the shah of iran 
there are also letters informing him he had an island off 
greenland and a mountain in antarctica named for him and a letter 
from secretary of state john foster dulles designating him the 
official us representative to the coronation of the king of nepal 
gauthier said he is often asked why the university even keeps 
the memorabilia thomas left behind 
people ask me who cares and i say a lot of people care 
the older you get the more you reminisce gauthier said 
he chronicled history for several generations he was our tour

indiatafane mali ap noumou diakite put a finger to his 
lips and pointed to a stand of acacias near the water where a tree 
trunk seemed to step forward there at the edge of the pool were 
the gourmas the last remaining wild elephant herd in subsaharan 
africa 
a 6ton bull raised his trunk in a graceful backward arc and 
sprayed a cooling stream of water about 50 other elephants bathed 
languidly near some cattle drinking from the murky pool 
suddenly for diakite and a reporter it was worth all the days 
of dust and relentless heat of a bronzeandcancer sun of northern 
mali 
the us ambassador to mali robert pringle had a similar 
experience with diakite leader of the regional livestock authority 
it was marvelous although a bit scary youre on foot not in 
a vehicle and really in the middle of nowhere near animals which 
have never been tamed by anyone he said 
it is miraculous that they have survived here where wildlife 
has generally been run ragged 
hidden in the remote reaches of northeastern mali the gourmas 
are the last remaining herd on the southern fringe of the sahara 
desert according to a report commissioned by the us agency for 
international development they are the most northern herd on the 
continent one of the last to roam free 
the gourmas are fast in their pursuit of food water and shade 
across an arid 4800squaremile migratory zone an area slightly 
smaller than connecticut 
no accurate count has been made of how many elephants are out 
there but several international agencies and governments 
including the united states hope to conduct a census soon 
for the moment the best estimate comes from diakite whose 
world bankfinanced program has hundreds of agents in the brush 
speaking with nomadic herders the best they can estimate is 500 to 
1500 elephants share the vast expanse of golden savannah 
rosecolored dunes oases and hardpan flats 
there are a lot of calves they say and the number of elephants 
seems to have been on the rise since the devastating drought of the 
mid1980s that decimated the herd 
whatever their number the gourma elephants are a tiny remnant 
of the enormous herds that less than century ago roamed this area 
from senegal to chad drought killed some ivory poachers 
slaughtered more 
but the gourmas were blessed with small tusks and good 
neighbors unlike people living near elephant populations in other 
parts of africa the tuareg fulani and songhai of mali consider 
the elephants good luck 
when an elephant passes between two hills near my village the 
people say it will be a good growing season this doesnt always 
pan out but were fond of the elephants anyway said jeangeny 
dao a guide 
stephen cobb an elephant expert and director of the environment 
and development group at oxford university said that the gourma 
elephants estimated footlong tusks have protected them somewhat 
from ivoryseeking poachers but the cultural tradition is far and 
away the most important factor 
in mali we find an ideal to which we should aspire in getting 
people to live amicably with the elephants cobb said 
the number of elephants throughout africa has plummeted over the 
last eight years from 12 million to about 600000 in october at 
a meeting in lausanne switzerland the signatories to the 
convention on international trade in endangered species approved a 
formal ban on ivory trade 
despite the ban china has said it will continue to import ivory 
for jewelry and other objects experts predict that at the current 
rate of slaughter africas elephants could be extinct before the 
end of the century 
even in mali conflict has developed as the spreading desert 
forces nomads to give up their animal herds and settle down near 
water holes to plant crops 
more and more people are grumbling about elephants tromping on 
turnips or munching on millet supplies and it may not be long 
before they start looking upon them as pests rather than symbols of 
luck 
elephants and gardens dont mix said pringle there are 
new and increasing conflicts with the local people it seems a safe 
bet that they will not survive another 10 years without a 
management regime of some sort 
cobb agreed there is an urgent need for sensitive and firm 
planning limits on places that can be developed for agriculture 
instead of a haphazard freeforall 
fences built around gardens might be one solution 
a 10footwide jumble of sharp stones will keep elephants 
away cobb said they have sensitive feet 
but he added that much can be learned from the little gourmas 
there must be a better solution to saving the elephant than 
shutting them up in national parks and turning them into tamed 
tourist attractions he said the gourma elephants can teach us 
ways of making elephant conservation work handinhand with the 
economic development of people who share the land

after vic monia headed a campaign that helped 
persuade local voters to limit developments on surrounding 
hillsides he immediately had to fend off a 40 million defamation 
suit filed by a developer 
citizens who crusade against local polluters or new developments 
are increasingly likely to be hit with such suits called 
slapps or strategic lawsuits against public participation two 
university of denver professors say they say the suits are 
unconstitutional and discourage citizen participation some slapp 
targets however are slapping back with notable success 
the suit against monia a computer engineer in saratoga calif 
never made it to court last year nine years after it was filed 
he won 200000 in a countersuit when a jury ruled he was the 
victim of malicious prosecution 
but the developers slapp against monia and his environmental 
and homeowners group had an effect intimidated city council 
members exempted the developer from some new restrictions and many 
local homeowners groups disbanded monia said 
i saw the impact of the lawsuit in the community a lot less 
participation he said people were talking about youve got 
to be careful you speak out someones gonna sue you 
i got so preoccupied he said i ended up leaving my job 
i thought about moving out of the state my daughters at the time 
were quite young wed just moved into a new home the payments 
were pretty goodsized and my wife said are you sure you havent 
risked everything weve worked for it really began to weigh very 
heavily on me 
now he said hed think twice before participating in local 
politics 
monias is one of hundreds of cases tracked by law professor 
george pring and sociology professor penelope canan as part of a 
2year study financed by the national science foundation 
pring and canan say there are thousands more and the numbers 
have been growing since the 1970s with the greatest concentration 
in areas with a high quality of life and a large number of educated 
newcomers particularly california new york and colorado 
among the slapps they studied 
a louisville colo woman circulated petitions opposing plans 
for a housing development on nearby farmland and was sued by the 
developer 
a sutton wva blueberry farmer told federal authorities that 
operators of a nearby coal mine had polluted a river and killed 
fish in it he was hit with a 200000 libel lawsuit 
a group of citizens in washington and warren counties in new 
york went to court to block a planned trash incinerator and were 
countersued by the counties for 15 million 
the league of women voters in beverly hills calif supported 
a ballot initiative to stop a condominium project and wrote two 
letters to a local newspaper criticizing it the developer sued the 
league for 63 million 
slapps arent meant to be won theyre meant to intimidate the 
professors concluded 
they usually dont even get to court and once there more than 
90 percent of the plaintiffs lose pring said by that time 
though the citizen opposition often is scared off or into 
compromise the professors said 
the average slapp seeks 9 million in damages and takes 36 
months to resolve 
hundreds of people weve talked to are literally terrified at 
the thought of losing their homes under multimilliondollar 
lawsuits pring said 
the suits also dissuade people who merely hear about them from 
participating in politics he said 
state authorities are starting to act a legislative proposal in 
new york for example would require developers to prove actual 
malice on the part of citizen opponents before they could file 
slapps said nancy stearns of th new york attorney generals 
environmental protection bureau 
its troublesome stearns said particularly in the 
environmental arena citizen participation is really key the law 
relies on the involvement of citizens in the environmental process 
its not just exercising rights but being a responsible citizen 
she said the increase in slapps in the last 10 to 15 years could 
be due to rising citizen concern about the environment 
pring and canan said it also could be the result of a generally 
more litigious society noting that many slapps are unrelated to 
the environment but instead are filed by local or school officials 
against citizens or parents 
in a recent case in suburban denver for example a teacher 
accused by fundamentalist christian parents of teaching witchcraft 
sued the parents for slander police officers have sued citizens 
who complained about their behavior and elected officials have 
claimed defamation when citizens called for their jobs the 
professors say 
the right to tell our elected government representatives what 
we think and what we want them to do for us is the most basic right 
we have said pring what is more basic than parents going to 
school with complaints about their childrens education 
monia said he stewed about the injustice of the suit filed 
against him for almost a year after it was dismissed before 
deciding to sue the developer and the developers attorney in 
addition to the 200000 jury award from the developer last year 
monia won an outofcourt settlement with the attorney 
in a more prominent california case last year a group of kern 
county farmers who successfully fought off a slapp by agribusiness 
giant jg boswell co in a water dispute countersued and won a 
135 million judgment against boswell for infringing on their 
constitutional rights 
the court ruled boswell filed the libel suit in 1982 to 
intimidate the farmers so they would not support a state 
proposition 
unlike slapps many slappbacks are succeeding said pring 
who testified on the farmers behalf it used to be filers could 
file these cases with impunity now i have to counsel wouldbe 
filers and their attorneys they may be walking themselves into a 
multimilliondollar action 
still he said the farmers told him they would never again 
participate in politics 
monia who said he was lucky enough to be able to weather nine 
years of legal bills hopes his victory encourages others 
and i hope that they can feel that if they go after 
individuals or companies who misuse the judicial system for 
political purposes that they can win he said

the rev j dean brackley was surprised at how 
deeply the murders of six jesuit priests in el salvador shook him 
up 
for a couple of days i was disoriented said the theology 
professor at fordham university then somebody snapped me out of 
it you know some good is going to come out of this 
brackleys response was to become one of more than 20 jesuits 
from throughout the world to volunteer to replace their slain 
colleagues at the jose simeon canas central american university he 
and five other priests from ireland canada mexico and spain have 
been assigned to the salvadoran university and more may be sent 
over 
we feel the support of the whole society said the rev 
carlos cabarrus of the loyola novitiate in panama city 
six priests their housekeeper and her teenage daughter were 
dragged out of their beds on the night of nov 16 and fatally shot 
by uniformed men the director of el salvadors military college 
and eight other soldiers were charged with the murders 
in the aftermath of the killings a lot of jesuits volunteered 
from all over the world to go to salvador to keep the university 
going said the rev richard buhler executive secretary of the 
us jesuit conference in washington 
the blood of martyrs becomes the seed of christians he said 
cabarrus said jesuit officials in central america are evaluating 
the applications of at least 20 jesuit volunteers from other parts 
of the world he said not all the applicants would be selected 
because of problems with obtaining visas and matching skills with 
needs 
the rev joseph ohare president of fordham university and 
chairman of the association of jesuit colleges and universities 
said following a recent threeday visit that the volunteers were 
appreciated by their salvadoran brethren 
one of the things they told us was that the murders had really 
been a devastating blow to them ohare said they really felt 
terribly isolated and alone 
if past experience is a guide the violence will serve only to 
strengthen the religious order cabarrus said 
he said the school for religious novices was started in 1975 
with 10 students and began to experience a substantial increase in 
membership after the murder of el salvador archbishop oscar romero 
in 1980 the twoyear program now has 34 novices the largest in 
the central american provinces history 
cabarrus said it is too early to tell how central american youth 
will react to the recent murders but i hope it will be great for 
us in vocations 
he said none of the current novices have dropped out just the 
opposite they are very encouraged by seeing the witnesses of those 
jesuits who were assassinated 
at the university cabarrus said there is fear of further 
violence among some of the lay faculty members but not at the 
level of students and not for the jesuits of course 
brackley who did pastoral work in el salvador in 1984 and 1988 
said he does not deny there is danger but having worked most of 
the last 10 years in the south bronx in new york has helped him 
live with insecurity 
i dont want to be a martyr and i dont think i will be he 
said 
without sounding too irish about the whole thing brackley 
said he preferred a life of adventure to bordeom 
there are few higher dramas in the world of religion than in el 
salvador brackley said 
its a drama of dying and rising he said on the one 
hand dying and suffering on the other hand great hope

president bush says that ugly forms of 
discrimination and prejudice continue to mar the shining promise of 
america and that the country must overcome those ills

walter matthau his reading glasses hanging 
low on his nose a yellow cap that says mozart on his head 
runs a finger over the horse racing page in the morning newspaper 
his sporting blood is not aroused and he folds the paper and 
looks over the scene at the beverly hills tennis club where he has 
come to talk about cbss sunday movie the incident 
in the incident matthau plays a lawyer harmon cobb who 
reluctantly agrees to defend a german prisoner of war accused of 
murdering a popular local doctor at a pow camp in the united states 
during world war ii 
they tell me i have to defend him because they want a fair 
trial and im the only qualified lawyer available he says i 
dont want the case because my sons fighting in europe and during 
the trial i get a telegram saying hes been killed in action 
harmon cobb is an unassuming man nondescript quite ordinary 
hes not well off financially hes intelligent and very fair 
thats the story regardless of his personal prejudices hes going 
to defend this man to the best of his ability 
the incident filmed on location in colorado springs also 
stars susan blakely as matthaus daughterinlaw robert carradine 
as the prosecutor peter firth as the german defendant barnard 
hughes as the victim harry morgan as the judge and william 
shallert as the constable 
it was directed by joseph sargent from a screenplay by michael 
and james norell sargent directed matthau in the taking of 
pelham one two three 
matthau began his career as a featured villain in the 
kentuckian in 1955 but he became a staple of screwball comedies 
in the next two decades in such films as the bad news bears and 
the sunshine boys 
among friends at the tennis club matthau also shows many sides 
to his personality 
lifting his cap to examine the emblem matthau explains that 
mozart is for the composer and not a race horse 
i belong to the mozart club and you have to listen to 25 hours 
a week of his music to join he says 
on my way here i was listening to his 24th piano concerto in a 
minor key he says humming a few bars mozart was the only 
composer who knew how to write music everyone else is a clumsy 
oaf 
matthau says he conducts the los angeles mozart orchestra and 
the beverly hills symphony for about 10 minutes once a year 
matthau had met the day before with playwright neil simon 
producer howard koch and jack lemmon to talk about a movie sequel 
to the odd couple the popular comedy about hopelessly 
mismatched roommates 
its 25 years later and we see whats happening to the odd 
couple says matthau who was the sloppy oscar to lemmons 
fastidious felix in the 1968 movie version of simons broadway 
comedy felixs daughter and oscars son are getting married 
thats how we get together 
matthau won a tony for his role as oscar in the odd couple 
on broadway and a tony for a supporting role in a shot in the 
dark he received an academy award as best supporting actor 
playing with lemmon in the 1966 movie fortune cookie 
portraying a lawyer who mixed greed and goofiness 
the television movie is matthaus first return to the medium in 
a dramatic role since the 1970s on pbss hollywood television 
theatre in the 1970s he played boris thomashefsky an actor in 
the jewish theater in a play about paul muni he recalls that he 
narrated a pbs series on shakespeare about 20 years ago he starred 
in the syndicated series tallahassee 7000 in 1961 he was 
offered the role of oscar in the series version of the odd 
couple but turned it down 
matthaus most recent american feature film was couch trip 
two years ago then he went to italy to make little devils 
in little devils he costars with robert benign i play a 
priest who exorcises the devil from this woman he says then 
the devil and i sort of pal around like the odd couple it did 
big business in italy 
matthau isnt sure what hes going to do next 
maybe i ought to do a play he says im getting tired of 
waiting for a good script ill probably do more television im 
trying to do something with a little merit i read a tv movie 
script the other day but they cast it with a younger guy 
ive been asked to do a series but ive sort of cooled that 
idea i dont want to do another series he paused unless 
something spectacular comes along its difficult to do good 
quality scripts every week the shows with good quality week after 
week are few and far between

the past seven months have seen rapid change in 
south africas apartheid the system imposed more than 40 years 
ago to keep the races apart an associated press correspondent who 
has watched the changes from his base in johannesburg looks at 
where apartheid stands now 
</TEXT>

miracles are happening 
said olga lutu who runs a school in a black shantytown freedom 
is a real possibility 
she was looking into the future 
so in his way was tj ferreira a 39yearold white service 
station owner 
i played sports with blacks and that didnt bother me he 
said i didnt mind lunching with blacks we just dont want to 
be governed by them 
apartheid while not dead is showing symptoms of terminal 
illness and the question before south africa now seems to be 
whether it will die a peaceful or painful death 
growing numbers of south africans across the political spectrum 
from black activists to rightwing whites believe the last of 
the major apartheid laws imposed in 1948 may be scrapped or 
rendered ineffective within a year or two possibly within months 
however sweeping the legal changes apartheid will leave a 
legacy of mistrust prejudice and economic inequality that may take 
decades to overcome 
but longterm worries are now coupled with a surge of optimism 
among blacks following president fw de klerks decision to free 
african national congress leader nelson mandela and lift a 30year 
ban on his organization 
everybody came out of their houses when we heard the news and 
we were singing in the streets said mrs lutu a robust 
energetic mother of four whose school is in a shantytown called 
orange farms 
she believes statutory apartheid will be gone within a few 
years a result of blacks increasing willingness to challenge the 
laws and the national party governments increasing reluctance to 
counter with repression 
the people are liberating themselves she said nothing 
ever happens if people are quiet 
apartheid has been crumbling slowly but steadily for more than a 
decade socalled petty apartheid segregation of theaters 
beaches and buses among other things has ended in most areas 
and rural blacks no longer face legal barriers if they want to move 
to a city 
de klerk has speeded up the pace of reform during his seven 
months in office asserting that discrimination is wrong and 
proposing negotiations aimed at extending political rights to 
blacks black militants are using their new maneuvering room to 
press for abolition of the last crucial group of laws known as the 
pillars of apartheid 
these include the group areas act which mandates segregation of 
residential areas the land act which prevents blacks from owning 
land in more than 80 percent of south africa and the population 
registration act which requires all south africans to be 
officially classified by race 
these laws have enabled the government to exclude blacks from 
national elections and persist with the last major categories of 
segregation residential areas staterun schools and public 
hospitals 
service station owner ferreira an afrikaner and a member of the 
proapartheid conservative party serves on the municipal council 
in boksburg an industrial city near johannesburg he and other 
conservatives took control of the council in 1988 and reinstituted 
whitesonly policies at recently integrated municipal 
facilities 
ferreira an outgoing man with a closeknit family holds de 
klerk as a traitor to the afrikaner people 
he said white conservatives were prepared to fight or secede 
into an allwhite homeland if the government surrendered power to 
blacks 
if blacks moved into his comfortable middleclass neighborhood 
he said theyll want whats ours a group might decide they 
like my house theyll come in and take it 
he expressed deep concern as well about the prospect of blacks 
entering whitesonly schools 
once that happens there will be fights among the kids most 
of our children have grown up wanting to be with their own 
people he said and whose standard of education do we adopt 
the blacks are so far behind in evolution theyll never catch up 
but theuns eloff a 34yearold afrikaner who has worked closely 
with ancaligned groups is happy with the way de klerk is handling 
things 
the national party has put into motion an irreversible process 
which within at the latest five years will erode its power base 
totally he said 
apartheid is finished

<TEXT>
eloff was reared in a loyal national party family and became a 
minister in the same branch of the dutch reformed church to which 
de klerk belongs but he quit this job and became a racerelations 
consultant after church leaders criticized him for antiapartheid 
political activities that included participation in a 1987 meeting 
with the anc 
eloff says de klerks moves took him and other liberal 
afrikaners by surprise he is now convinced the government will 
remove the remaining apartheid laws and yield political power if 
the anc provides some sort of guarantees for minority rights 
a majority of middleground afrikaners will accept the change 
grudgingly but theyll accept it he said it will be 
traumatic for some but its in fashion that will take them a 
long way 
other signs of the gradual softening of apartheid are in the 
blacks themselves 
many have overcome immense economic and educational handicaps to 
form a vast reservoir of professional and political talent 
one is cyril dlova 35 
the son of a bank messenger he now is the personnel director 
for the south african subsidiary of a us corporation lives in 
the welloff whites only johannesburg suburb of sandton and 
sends his daughter to a private multiracial school 
officially the only blacks allowed to reside in sandton are 
livein servants but dlova says hes encountered no problems in 
defying the now almostunenforced group areas act 
within days after we moved in my neighbors came over 
bringing a cake to welcome me my daughter swims in their pools 
he said its the way this country should be 
dlova who asked that his company not be identified so he 
wouldnt have to clear his remarks with his superiors said racial 
attitudes among white executives have changed slowly during his 10 
years with the firm 
when i came here there was a feeling of blacks cant do 
anything now they say maybe some blacks can do it we must next 
get to the stage where they believe all blacks can do it if they 
get the opportunity 
de klerk is on record as saying whites should retain the right 
to have segregated neighborhoods and schools but the government 
now allows communities the option of integrating and education 
officials recently dropped hints that at least some whitesonly 
schools could accept blacks if parents approved 
the staterun television network for years an unquestioning 
defender of apartheid now broadcasts news footage and interviews 
that suggest integration might be a good thing 
mrs lutu says the governments attitude has changed markedly in 
recent months as evidenced by official willingness to let former 
illegal squatters in her community gain ownership of property for 
the first time in their lives 
the pride theyre showing now in owning their own land you 
can see it she said before there was a feeling of despair 
they had lost dignity the army would come in and wreck their 
vehicles take away goods beat the youths now that has stopped 
the same people who used to raid us in the middle of the night are 
helping provide land and facilities for us 
many militant black leaders remain skeptical of the governments 
ultimate intentions but even anc officials now say they believe 
most whites are ready to give up on apartheid 
said thabo mbeki the ancs foreign affairs spokesman i dont 
imagine it will be terribly difficult to continue to be allies in 
building a postapartheid future if you have been allies in getting 
rid of this unwanted past

if south africans need assurances that 
apartheid can be dismantled peacefully and efficiently they need 
only look across their northern border into namibia 
for decades the territory was subjected to virtually the same 
system of racial segregation that prevailed in south africa 
namibias ruler since world war i the best equipped schools and 
hospitals were reserved for whites while blacks lived in rundown 
segregated townships or underdeveloped tribal reserves 
starting in 1978 the apartheid laws began to fall by early 
this year as the territory headed toward independence on march 21 
the process was complete 
formerly allwhite schools opened their doors to blacks without 
incident hospitals did likewise an assembly composed of political 
parties on opposite sides during a 23year guerrilla war 
unanimously approved a constitution outlawing discrimination of all 
kinds 
at the ceremony in which the constitution was adopted several 
speakers said south africa should take inspiration from namibias 
harmonious independence process 
we confounded the doubters said sam nujoma who led the 
southwest africa peoples organization during its long bush war 
and now is namibias presidentdesignate 
one big difference between namibia and south africa is the size 
of white population about 75000 of namibias 13 million people 
are white compared to 5 million out of 37 million in south africa 
but namibias whites play a comparable role to those in south 
africa holding key posts in business government mining health 
care and other professions because of swapos conciliatory 
attitude few whites have been leaving 
whites would like to offer their experiences knowledge and 
abilities to the country and its people this will however only 
take place if they are accepted as part of the country said 
jannie de wet a leader of the largest white political party 
residential areas in namibia have been opened to all races for 
several years although relatively few blacks have had the desire 
or the money to move into welltodo white neighborhoods 
however many swapo officials have settled in white areas since 
returning from exile last year nujoma is one of the few 
topranking swapo leaders to maintain residence in katutura the 
main black area of windhoek 
godfrey gaoseb named by nujoma to be finance minister said he 
was escorted while househunting in white areas by a real estate 
agent who is a conservative afrikaner 
we became such good friends that we now visit each other 
frequently he said

carol burnett may have come up with something 
new on television where recycling the past is usually the wave of 
the future 
in her anthology series for nbc carol amp company shell 
play a different character each week in what essentially are 
oneact comedies 
we put up a blank canvas every week and throw on the paint 
burnett said each story is characterdriven and focuses on 
relationships in essence its a pilot every week if someone 
said pick the most difficult form of television wed pick this 
thats why no ones ever done it before 
the show will be shot live in front of an audience featuring a 
repertory company and frequently a guest star burnett said 
each week we make a fresh start she said thats the 
challenge for the actors the writers the set designers 
everybody were even doing a musical 
nbc has not yet set a premiere date for the show but has said 
it will begin in late march 
matt williams who created abcs roseanne is the executive 
producer and head writer the repertory company is made up of terry 
kiser meagan fay richard kind jeremy piven and anita barone 
burnett of course starred for 12 years in the carol burnett 
show but that show like foxs the tracey ullman show 
relied on skits 
most anthologies in the past were dramatic there have been a 
few comedy anthologies 1985s george burns comedy week for 
instance but burns merely introduced a filmed show with a 
different cast each week 
as with her old variety show burnett will come out and meet the 
audience in the theater at the disney studio then shell change 
costumes and join the other actors the story will be acted out in 
sequence and at the end the actors will make a curtain call 
its important that the viewers see the audience she said 
we dont want anyone to think were using canned laughter ive 
only done a few things for television without an audience when i 
started this i said an audience was important especially if 
youre trying to be funny our players and guests are used to 
working before an audience 
that wasnt always true on her variety series where some of the 
guests were movie stars who had worked only before a camera gloria 
swanson who asked to take part after seeing burnetts famous spoof 
of sunset boulevard was very nervous and had to be coaxed 
through her songanddance role 
movie spoofs were a hallmark of burnetts old show an outgrowth 
of a childhood filled with countless hours in movie theaters 
recently she attended the american cinema awards 
i was in heaven burnett said every old movie star was 
there ann blyth huntz hall june allyson turhan bey it took 
almost an hour to introduce everybody people were just dying at 
seeing these people 
we havent done any spoofs yet on our new show she said 
but we did do a takeoff on the film noir detective films of the 
1940s the dick powell kind of thing in murder my sweet in which 
you spat out the dialogue like bullets we did it mainly to 
introduce our repertory company thats as close as weve gotten to 
a spoof were really doing stories 
in one show burnett plays the matriarch of a television soap 
opera who appears to be a terror until you see her with a security 
guard played by robert guillaume in another shes an eccentric 
woman who shows up on a dock in gulfport miss where nell carter 
is fishing her only concern is that shes going to be abducted by 
space aliens 
glenda jackson is a radio pop psychologist in another show in 
which burnett shows up at the station to say the psychologists 
advice ruined her life another spotlights a woman who surprises a 
few people when she goes to her high school reunion in yet 
another burnett and alex rocco play a romantic couple who continue 
to work together in a scientific laboratory 
burnett also has her own production company kalola productions 
at the disney studio in partnership with former television 
newswoman marcia brandwynne kalola is doing an interview show for 
the disney channel called a conversation with in which 
burnett so far has interviewed bob hope george burns and betty 
white 
kalola has a number of feature and television movies and a tv 
series in development with various branches of walt disney 
productions 
anna phelan hamilton who wrote mask and gorillas in the 
mist is writing a movie based on burnetts autobiography one 
more time a movie musical called rehearsal club is based on 
burnetts early life on broadway and a movie version of once 
upon a mattress the stage musical that made her a star is in 
the works 
im going to be like alfred hitchcock and have cameos in all 
these movies she said in once upon a mattress ill 
probably be the queen well have a big talent search for someone 
to play my old role as winifred

tom clancys hightech thrillers have been a phenomenon of the 
publishing industry although jammed with scientific data his 
novels have been bought by millions of readers despite their 
immense popularity and tense drama none has been dramatized on the 
screen until now 
thats understandable clancys labyrinthian plots and 
dependence on military hardware for suspense require the most deft 
of treatment on film the hunt for red october is fortunate in 
that regard it is a nailbiter from beginning to end 
like the book the film requires close attention the slightest 
blip on the sonar screen could mean destruction of a nuclear 
submarine the casual viewer should stay home 
red october named for the month of the russian revolution in 
1917 is the new soviet submarine one with fishlike gills that 
allows it to voyage undetected capt ramius sean connery heads 
the sub west on an unauthorized mission in the pregorbachev era 
both the soviet and us fleets mobilize to chase ramius the 
soviets realize he and his officers plan to defect the americans 
misinformed by moscow fear he is a maverick who might launch a 
nuclear attack on the united states 
cia agent jack ryan alec baldwin with experience in analyzing 
the soviet navy is enlisted to track down the red october aiding 
the pursuit is a los angelesclass nuclear sub commanded by scott 
glenn with a wizard sonar operator courtney b vance 
larry ferguson and donald stewart did a terrific job of 
compressing a huge novel into a playable screenplay john mctiernan 
proved with die hard that he can stretch suspense almost to the 
breaking point and he exceeds himself with the hunt for red 
october 
what a marvel sean connery is his dialogue is laconic but that 
great scottish face reveals everything in his mind alec baldwin 
makes the leap to stellar status with absolute ease kevin costner 
harrison ford and mel gibson make room for the new kid 
outstanding in the virtually allmale cast are glenn vance 
james earl jones sam neill richard jordan and peter firth 
mace neufeld as producer performed the almost superhuman task in 
putting together the multitude of details for the hunt for red

new york stories touchstone vhsbeta 8995 rated pg 
 
new york stories was a disaster during its theatrical 
release but it might play better on the small screen at home 
because you can always zoom to your favorite vignette and skip the 
others 
it began as an excellent idea take three top american 
filmmakers set them out on the streets of new york and loop their 
efforts into one fulllength feature to celebrate those collective 
talents and the city they supposedly enshrined 
unfortunately the idea doesnt quite gel the video consists of 
three vignettes by martin scorsese frances coppola and woody 
allen but only scorseses life lessons is worth the 8995 or 
cost of rental its also the first story in the production so you 
dont even need to touch the remote unless youre an unconditional 
woody allen fan skip the next two 
life lessons is the only vignette that truly mirrors the 
spirit and attitude of new york in this case the downtown art 
world it has a feel texture and mood thanks in part to the 
gritty and witty original screenplay by bronxborn writer richard 
price and the sensitive and probing lens of the celebrated 
cinematographer nestor almendros it is a tigheinrich

kevin costner has a special 
memory about the sunswept seaside resort of puerto vallarta 
i was here about 12 years ago on my honeymoon at that time i 
was considering being an actor on the plane out of puerto 
vallarta i ran into richard burton and thought to talk to him i 
had to devise a plan to get at him because he wanted his privacy 
which i completely understand now costner said 
he had blocked out four seats so he could be alone after we 
were in the air i sat down beside him and i asked him about the 
job of acting he was very gracious and helpful 
my wife and i had saved 20 to take the bus from lax los 
angeles international airport back to orange county but we hadnt 
counted on the mexican airport tax of 10 apiece so when we got 
off the plane we had about 6 between us we sat down on our 
suitcases on one of those islands at lax just like the hitchhiking 
scene from it happened one night 
as we were sitting there a limousine stopped right by us the 
window came down and it was richard burton saying good luck he 
thought to say one last thing to me the window went up and he 
drove away it was kinda nice just like a scene out of a movie 
the costners managed to hitchhike home 
when costner returned to puerto vallarta last year he didnt 
stay at a tiny hotel near the airport as he had on his honeymoon 
he came with all the perks of a superstar to do location work for 
the movie revenge the love triangle in which he stars with 
anthony quinn and madeleine stowe as evidence of his new status 
costner also served as executive producer 
costner 34 returned here for a round of interviews at the 
elegant camino real hotel to publicize the opening of revenge 
normally publicityshy he answered questions dutifully though he 
seemed to be wishing he was back home in la canada near pasadena 
the actor chose to make revenge before the academy 
awardnominated field of dreams though filming came afterward 
he found the jim harrison novel to be a fabulous piece of 
material a toughline movie i move toward that kind of writing 
e added that he has picked all of his films since the big 
chill in which his role as one of the sixties radicals was 
reduced to a scene at his own funeral 
what does he look for 
i look for the same thing that a lot of people do fresh air 
originality of concept things that surprise me little things 
inside a movie that move me all those things combined hopefully 
become a satisfying experience you cant do a movie just because 
youve always wanted to do a violent one or a comedy you have to 
do one that makes sense to you 
his post as executive producer he admitted was not the 
wisest move in a sense because its not a very meaningful title 
not to put it down or the people who gave it to me ive had as 
much power on other films as to the quality of my arguments or 
points 
in revenge costner faced a legendary actor with great 
screen presence quinn he was unfazed 
ive had a lot of experience with those kinds of guys gene 
hackman no way out sean connery the untouchables burt 
lancaster field of dreams he said 
one thing is you dont compete with them thats for sure 
thats a lesson in acting that you dont compete these guys are 
legendary and the movie is so much better off by their being 
there i have plenty of time to get my own share of viewing as far 
as im concerned when those guys are on the set theyre the stars 
of the movie 
costner was not only the star of his last movie dances with 
wolves but director and coproducer the story of a civil war 
soldier who moves into the world of the sioux indians has been the 
subject of rumors that he soared over budget and schedule costner 
bristled when asked about the reports 
the control of that movie is entirely on my shoulders so its 
fate i take full responsibility for he said the rumors seem 
to me kind of silly there have to be more important things to talk 
about than me going 2 or 3 percent over my budget 
budgets in movies are at best an estimation of things i went 
a lot of days over but the interesting thing is that we went only 
3 percent over budget we managed our money very well 
when you see the size of the movie youll realize no one in 
town could make that movie except us we made a movie that in a 
studio concept would be a 30 to 40 million movie the numbers 
that are being mentioned are not correct its less than 18 
million im not going to tell you what it is because i havent 
completed the movie 
its convenient to say kevins gate as in heavens gate 
or watergate thats kind of cute journalism that i dont really 
like 
kevin costner is a california boy son of an electric utility 
worker who moved the family from town to town he was a runt in 
high school and though he grew to 6foot1 in college he remained 
shy and dateless like many actors he countered his shyness with 
drama classes 
after graduation from california state university at fullerton 
he married his only date cindy silva and tried a marketing job 
for 30 days he quit in disgust to seek work in hollywood for six 
years he worked by day on crews at raleigh studio and studied 
acting at night the big chill provided his breakthrough for a 
major motion picture but his role of the dead friend was edited 
down to merely a scene showing him in his coffin this was followed 
by his riproaring gunslinger in silverado 
costner now faces the instant recognizability that he observed 
with richard burton can he maintain any privacy 
i can he said people are actually very good with me 
sometimes they have strong feelings and they want to talk to me 
im still a citizen im a citizen of the world i can go places 
im actually treated the way everybody should be treated my 
private world has closed behind me but a new one has opened up

roll over beethoven go powder your wig bach 
meet the newest musical sensation wolfgang amadeus mozart 
i think that nowadays mozart appeals to more people in more 
countries on more levels than any other composer who ever lived 
says musicologist hc robbins landon whose 1791 mozarts last 
year was a bestseller in 1988 and whose new book mozart the 
golden years looks at the last decade of mozarts life 
it used to be beethoven and bach he said now it is 
certainly mozart ambivalent music speaks to an ambivalent age 
with beethoven the music starts stormily and ends 
triumphantly in c major the message is much more diffuse and 
cloudy in mozart you often dont really know whether the music 
youre listening to is very happy or unhappy maybe it is both all 
this appeals emotionally to people nowadays who have begun to think 
the world is in dreadful danger and all is not straightforward 
one of the most famous the elvira madigan movement is 
ambivalent music is it happy people dont know why they love it 
but they love it it obviously has a very special message 
nothing becomes a best seller by accident 
robbins landon who was born in boston in 1926 and now lives in 
france has written 16 books most are about haydn and mozart 
my life has been dedicated to music he said the 
principal thing ive done is to have published haydns music 
21000 pages of haydn in score when i was young ninetenths of 
haydn wasnt published now ninetenths of haydn is published 
that was a great labor of love you dont live from that i 
used to do a lot of tv scripts mostly for the bbc im doing them 
again now at the moment im writing a fivepart history of music 
in venice a triple production by london paris and pbs in this 
country 
from studying mozarts music robbins landon found the composer 
to have had a split personality he was writing music easily 
comprehensible to 18th century buffs and he was writing farout 
stuff with extreme violence why was of course a mystery then i 
read this theory of dr peter g davies that mozart was manic 
depressive or had those tendencies 
dr davies published long scholarly articles on mozarts 
illness ive quoted them his ups and downs came in waves when he 
had downs he felt compelled to compose in minor keys which were so 
far out of their time when don giovanni goes to hell thats 
farout music he must have known the public wouldnt have known 
what to do with these things 
his piano concertos in d minor and c minor began to alienate 
the public they began to be the cause of mozarts concerts in 
vienna being less well attended and unattended from 1787 on 
mozart began to get into debt because of the fact his farout 
music was not comprehensible to the average concertgoer it wasnt 
until 1791 the last year of his life that he began to extricate 
himself from a mountain of debts 
robbins landon called the academy awardwinning amadeus a 
great film which awakened much interest in mozart what people 
dont understand is that its not a biography of mozart they never 
said it was they said they were producing a film about mediocrity 
and jealousy and they used mozarts life as a very successful prop 
to tell the story 
the musicologists new book is based on johann pezzls 
daybyday chronicle of mozart in vienna from 1786 to 1790 
mozart the golden years is published here by schirmer and 
sells for 2995 
robbins landon was given the idea for his lifes work by his 
piano teacher when he was 13 
he said youre never going to be the greatest pianist in the 
world you ought to do something for haydn all the other composers 
have their collective works we dont know how much haydn wrote a 
lot of manuscripts are in private possession he said i had to 
turn myself into a fully trained professional musician robbins 
landon recalled 
i ended up going to boston where i conducted and managed an 
orchestra and formed a chamber orchestra with some pals i studied 
counterpoint and harmony we were happy young people doing music 
all day long 
my parents upper class new englanders said if we dont 
help you you wont make it they helped me up to writing a 
fivevolume biography of haydn which was published by indiana 
university press its a real monster it did end up making money 
but you cant live from that they sent me nice fat checks now and 
then to keep me going 
after id done what any single person can do for haydn then i 
went to mozart always the great love of my life 
robbins landon has been married for 32 years to austrian 
historian else radant 
she helps me he said she does a lot of research we live 
outside toulouse with secretaries and assistants we dont have any 
cross words with anybody in our house its nice to work in an 
atmosphere like that 
they all work hard swim take fivemile walks eat garlic 
vegetables from their garden often broil fish and drink the local 
wine 
the secret of a happy life the musicologist says is not your 
career or money if you have a happy marriage everything else you 
can work out 
the mozarts loved each other robbins landon said he wrote 
her pornographic letters from leipsig which i published for the 
first time in the new book nowadays it is nothing it is sweet 
if hed been in vienna in mozarts day robbins landon says i 
would have been a good routine kapellmeister music director i 
can compose and conduct if id had my wits about me i would have 
thought mozart was the greatest thing that ever happened im 
sure he was difficult 
he couldnt stand mediocrity and was arrogant with 
nonprofessionals i hope i would have been his friend

mystic and spiritual are not usually terms 
associated with a heavy metal band neither are introspective and 
cerebral 
but the british band the cult is an exception 
lead singer ian astbury springs from the same mold that produced 
jim morrison the late lead vocalist of the doors with his long 
inkblack hair vaulted cheekbones and penchant for wearing leather 
and snakeskin astbury looks more like an ancient medicine man than 
a rock singer 
his foil blond guitarist billy duffy grounds astburys 
otherworldliness with a hard rock perspective and balances the 
singers brooding seriousness with his own devilmaycare 
personality the band is rounded out by bassistrhythm guitarist 
jamie stewart and drummer matt sorum 
the cults first us release 1985s love kept them in the 
college radio spotlight with the meticulously arranged track she 
sells sanctuary the albums swirling psychedelic lyrics and 
jangly melodic guitar work pigeonholed the band into a genre known 
as gothic a trend started in britain in the early 80s 
by their next album electric in 1987 the bant released in england 
and europe duffy said 
we did a lot of our dirty laundry in public college 
alternative fans in america liked those recordings to us theyre 
very fledgling kind of experimental they have their moments but 
theyre not very relevant to where the cult is now 
part of the cults mystique stems from astburys interest in 
american indian myth and culture such songs as brother wolf 
sister moon from love and american horse from sonic 
temple depict not only the indians struggle with the white man 
but the folklore he created in trying to determine his own destiny 
the interest in indians was more prevalent in the earlier days 
of the band in southern death cult duffy says ians interest 
is still there but hes matured he has said im a white 
workingclass guy from the northwest of england who happens to 
personally feel very strongly an affinity for the american indian 
its not to the point of a flagflying exercise 
ians angle is that they do their own thing they exist they 
have their own dignity within themselves the last thing they need 
is some twobob rock n roll band carrying a flag for them 
duffy said the bands philosophy is simple 
the cult got together because we had the desire to make music 
together as individuals duffy said we all wanted to make a 
kind of music that no one in britain seemed to be interested in 
doing at the time 
from that we still maintain that basic desire we dig what 
we do were genuinely excited about the records we make and the 
songs we write we like to go out and play that to people and share 
it 
duffy doesnt see another style change coming down the line i 
think that thick sound that professional sound will be there but 
it will still be very human he said 
the band began its current tour of the united states and canada 
in san francisco on dec 27

judging from tony hillermans books 
you might think hes navajo and many navajos are surprised to 
learn hes not 
thats because hillerman has captured american indian cultures 
particularly navajo as no other novelist 
in 1987 he was given a special friend of the navajo award 
to go with his edgar allan poe award for best mystery of 1973 
dance hall of the dead his last two books a thief of time 
and talking god have been best sellers and he now has a 125 
million contract with harper amp row 
his latest book coyote waits is scheduled for june just 
in time to start making his first movie hillerman has a 
threepicture deal with robert redford filming starts this summer 
on an adaptation of his 1982 novel the dark wind hillerman 
serves as consultant 
the author redford producers sarah pillsbury and midge sanford 
and film executive bonnie lee toured the reservation in a rented 
station wagon with redford driving discussing which of hillermans 
navajo police mysteries should be the first film 
dark wind in which navajo and hopi cops solve drugrelated 
murders was chosen because of its mixture of two indian cultures 
it will be directed by errol morris the thin blue line 
it seemed to me that since so many people who go to movies are 
the kind of people who think all indians are alike it would be 
good to put two quite different tribes in he said 
i had taken for granted redford was going to start with thief 
of time he wants to direct that one himself said hillerman 
leaning back against the antique pigeonhole desk he got from an old 
hotel office above is the friend of the navajo plaque and a 
framed drawing of navajo ceremonial masks 
on his left above his word processor is a map of indian 
country eastern arizona western new mexico and southern utah and 
colorado and a window overlooking a back yard terraced with old 
railroad ties and bricks 
his is a modest brick home in an average albuquerque 
neighborhood 
redford reached while filming in the dominican republic said 
he likes working with the 64yearold author 
he is very unfettered by either success or too much trouble 
around him redford said he travels his own route and at his 
own pace hes rare in that he has that wonderful sense of 
structure of storytelling and a very clear eye as to the real 
nature of the navajo 
born anthony grove hillerman on may 27 1925 in sacred heart 
okla the son of a storekeeper young tony was his high school 
class historian but never gave much thought to writing 
i kind of liked to write and i read a lot but i didnt know 
real human beings were writers he said i mean writers and 
writing were not something in the imagination of a kid growing up 
out there 
the idea took seed when a wounded hillerman returned on 
convalescent furlough from france during world war ii a land mine 
explosion had shattered his left leg and severely burned his left 
eye the leg still bothers him sometimes and he never regained 
full use of the eye 
beatrice stahl a feature writer for the daily oklahoman in 
oklahoma city had done a story based on hillermans letters home 
and now she wanted to interview him so i went down there and 
talked to her she told me i ought to be a writer 
he took her advice and studied journalism at the university of 
oklahoma he graduated amid a flood of wardelayed students in 
1948 and he couldnt find a job on a newspaper 
so i took a job with an advertising agency writing radio 
commercials it was just a tryout job doing ads for cains better 
coffee and purina pig chow he said 
at oklahoma he met his wife marie they now have six grown 
children 
he also took a job driving a truck hauling oil field supplies 
one stop was the navajo reservation in new mexico on one run he 
saw navajos on horseback in ceremonial attire for the enemy way a 
soulcleansing ritual that follows combat they too were 
returning veterans 
of course most of them served in the pacific he said 
something about them touched him and he never forgot from then 
on he said new mexico was his ultimate destination 
when hillerman got the chance to be bureau manager for united 
press international in santa fe he grabbed it he served as 
executive editor of the new mexican in santa fe after leaving the 
wire service 
during the santa fe stint he covered a story in which a 
jicarilla apache police officer was shot to death the 
investigation showed the fallen officer had coolly shifted his 
revolver from his wounded arm to his good hand and had shot one of 
his assailants before dying the indian was the model for navajo 
detective lt joe leaphorn mainstay of hillermans novels 
hillerman had sold some nonfiction through a new york agent 
when he offered her the manuscript in the late 1960s for his first 
leaphorn novel the blessing way she told him just get rid 
of all the indian stuff 
probably it was fairly good advice but it wasnt what i 
wanted to do he said an editor at harper amp row liked it indian 
stuff and all it was published in 1970 
navajos tell hillerman they like his books because theyre true 
to navajo culture and the navajos come out winners in fact he 
said many navajos express surprise upon learning hes not a navajo 
himself 
i run into that when i sign books around the reservation he 
said 
despite the mystery witchcraft and violence of his books 
hillerman bristles at any suggestion the reservation might be a 
dangerous place 
in the navajo culture all goals are toward harmony being 
peaceful working together people who turn against this are the 
worst kind of people he said when asked to define a navajo witch 
what does he like most about the navajo 
i like their emphasis on taking care of the family he said 
i like the dignity they give their women i like their attitude 
about material possessions they just dont attach any importance 
to them theres the idea that if you own too much you probably 
arent taking care of your family 
i like the emphasis they have on beauty aesthetics so many 
navajos seem to have a good eye for the sunset the pleasing design 
i like their sense of humor their stoic endurance of whatever 
comes down they endure

for a mystery writer theres probably 
nothing more mysterious than navajo culture author tony hillerman 
is fascinated by it and so apparently are his readers 
coming off his second straight new york times best seller 
talking god hillerman continues to examine indian cultural 
themes in coyote waits due for publication in june 
a navajo shaman is a pivotal figure in coyote waits in 
the dark wind the first of hillermans books destined for 
film hopi religion comes into play in dance hall of the dead 
it is zuni religion in the blessing way and skinwalkers 
navajo witchcraft is a central theme 
navajo police lt joe leaphorn hillermans main character is a 
skeptic about witchcraft but in several books he refers back to 
one of his early cases in which he failed to take it seriously and 
several people lost their lives 
in a recent interview hillerman said witchcraft is real enough 
and common enough to the navajo navajo acquaintances have given 
him several anecdotes but there are many examples in scholarly 
literature as well 
hillerman related a story one navajo once told him about seeing 
a witch 
it always takes place in the evening or night hillerman 
said it was shearing time lambing time and it was one of those 
copper sunsets right on the horizon a quartermile or so away he 
saw the witch a skinwalker with the head of a coyote 
the boys grandmother told him to run and get his 22caliber 
rifle and the youth took a shot at the witch 
i asked him did you hit him kenneth he said nah it was 
a navajo 22 
another anecdote involves an elderly weaver who called in a 
crystal gazer to counteract a witch a durango colo businessman 
and his wife drove the gazer out to the womans home and watched as 
he did his ritual hillerman said staring into the crystal the 
gazer claimed the witch was a neighbor and had buried something 
down the road presumably to cause her a problem 
the wife sat next to the crystal gazer and got a real strange 
look on her face hillerman said she said my god it was 
just like watching television she saw the same things in the 
crystal that he was describing 
then they went to the spot in the road and the gazer dug up the 
thing 
in the navajo culture all goals are toward harmony being 
peaceful working together people who turn against this are the 
worst kind of people he said 
hillerman who says he has learned most of what he knows about 
navajos from books has a framed drawing of navajo ceremonial masks 
above his desk each mask personifies a yei or navajo god and the 
ceremonies and masks continually turn up in his books 
kokopelli the water sprinkler is a key image in a thief of 
time a sacred mask of talking god kept at the smithsonian 
institution becomes a lethal weapon in the 1989 novel talking 
god and such rituals as the blessing way the enemy way and 
others give texture and color to hillermans stories which mix 
gentle navajo traditions with the jarring intrusion of hardedged 
anglo culture 
for the latter the author said all he needs to do is read the 
newspaper

rising country music singer garth brooks 
says his songs are a piece of my heart 
the 27yearold singersongwriterguitarist has had two hit 
records with the first two songs released from his debut album 
garth brooks 
his if tomorrow never comes which was no 1 on the country 
music charts in december is about the need to tell loved ones that 
you love them 
his too young to feel this damn old about a rodeo 
contestant whose only friends are lonely women and bad booze was a 
hit record last summer 
you have to let your heart talk brooks said in an 
interview if you just let whats in your heart out you are 
true 
brooks a native of tulsa okla where he was the last of six 
children has had a rapid rise since moving to nashville in june 
1987 prior to that he was a student at oklahoma state university 
where he was a javelin thrower for the school track team 
he also sang with the group santa fe a regional band that 
performed throughout oklahoma texas and new mexico 
after relocating to nashville he took a job running a boot 
store he was able to earn a living while pushing his music career 
an arrangement some other aspiring singers do not have 
i got the managers job and got to hire one employee my 
wife he said i had a very fortunate start 
brooks whose stocky frame is usually capped off with a spiffy 
cowboy hat also began singing on songwriters demonstration tapes 
tapes of new unrecorded songs that composers play for record 
companies in hopes of getting them chosen for albums 
but his real break came when capitol records executives heard 
him perform at a nashville entertainment association showcase 
based on this performance he signed a recording contract with 
capitol 
brooks has joined a handful of other young singers who are 
apparently going to shape the country music sound of the 1990s 
you just pray that you are going to be one of the chosen ones 
still around in five 15 20 years he said 
he senses a change in country music themes a change that has 
earned his style of music a growing number of fans 
country music isnt my dad got run over at the truck wash 
right after my wife left me this morning the music is set in a 
manner that everybody can relate to not just the guy driving the 
truck its very real and people are turning to it its not 
stereotyped any more he said 
the music has got to be real i look for things the common man 
would say such as the guy at walmart real people today are going 
to walmart 
the cuts on his first album many of which he wrote or cowrote 
are touching tunes of emotion and lifes roadblocks 
the song cowboy bill is about a cowboy storyteller who 
thrilled kids with stories about his days as a texas ranger adults 
doubted his veracity until he was found dead with his badge 
the cut the dance is about the good times before losing a 
loved one 
in every time that it rains brooks sings about a romantic 
fling that loses its intensity the second time around 
his if tomorrow never comes was so evocative that he 
received a letter from a virginia woman who said she was 
contemplating suicide until hearing the song and studying its 
message 
she said that ever since then her life has been turned 
around brooks said your songs are your swords your power 
its amazing the size of the sword you carry 
im looking for beliefs that need to be stated in this day and 
time 
i try to let people know that they arent working for nothing 
that what they see when they close their eyes at night doesnt 
always have to be a dream

hoping to keep the film and television 
industry happy and busy in new york officials have canceled a plan 
to charge 1000 a day to use state parks as scenic backdrops 
that charge would have applied to photographers and tv and film 
crews working on movies tv shows or advertisements the plan was 
unveiled last month as part of gov mario cuomos 513 billion 
state budget proposal 
officials from the state office of parks recreation and 
historic preservation thought it would have been a good way to 
raise about 200000 a year for what cuomo has said is a 
cashstarved state treasury and the fees could have been imposed 
without legislative approval 
economic development spokesman harold holzer said the filmmaking 
in new york is important to the states economy such movies as 
ishtar and arthur have made use of new yorks state parks 
since 1985 the state has been allowing the industry to use its 
150 parks and 34 historic sites without charge

sen dave durenberger had high hopes for a 
think tank he founded in 1984 americans for generational equity 
to sound an alarm about the bleak future he saw facing his 
childrens generation 
the baby boomer lobby group stirred a national debate on such 
issues as social security and housing while enraging advocates of 
the elderly with claims older americans were getting an unfair 
share of federal largesse 
but mounting ethics problems that threaten durenbergers career 
claimed his brainchild and silenced its voice at a time many people 
think age was just growing up 
ages blueribbon board of directors closed the organizations 
doors and fired its staff last month after the group ran out of 
money facing 40000 in unpaid bills 
an ongoing ethics investigation of durenberger and charges by 
the groups former director that the minnesota republican used age 
for political purposes made fund raising virtually impossible 
board members say 
i hate to see it just evaporate lamented board member 
richard lamm the former colorado governor who harbors hopes of 
resurrecting the group 
age never had more than a few hundred members and in its heyday 
was run by a staff of four on the cluttered ground floor of a 
capitol hill townhouse but for good or ill supporters and 
detractors alike say age brought public attention to generational 
equity 
lamm who once said terminally ill people had a duty to die 
and get out of the way says ages writings and conferences 
raised valid allegations that government policies enriched the 
elderly to the eventual detriment of children and workingage 
americans 
fair is fair money thats desperately needed for children 
in st paul is being transferred to millionaires in st 
petersburg lamm said 
but ages detractors whose ranks include the powerful american 
association of retired persons and families usa accused the group 
of fomenting generational warfare with grannybashing rhetoric 
the message that came loud and clear is weve got to cut the 
benefit programs for seniors i think thats why people responded 
to them so negatively said ron pollack executive director of 
families usa an advocacy organization for the elderly and their 
families 
they sought to divide people up on generational grounds most 
people really think in family terms and they dont think of grandma 
and grandpa as being evil and young people as being saints 
durenberger and the groups acting chairman rep tim penny 
dminn claim that was not the intention 
durenberger who declined to be interviewed formed age at a 
time when sen daniel moynihan dny was warning that more and 
more children were growing up poor while the elderly enjoyed the 
lowest poverty rate of any age group 
we have entered an era in which the date of ones birth has 
become the prime determinate of ones prospects for realizing the 
american dream durenberger said in a 1987 interview 
besides lamm ages board included stanford university president 
donald kennedy and carla hills now the us trade representative 
under the direction of former durenberger aide paul hewitt age 
issued articles speeches and reports that raised explosive 
questions about rising social security benefits and other issues 
one age pamphlet went so far as to suggest the nation was 
raising a generation of young americans who will live in 
financial slavery hewitt says age was calling attention to 
legitimate questions 
but the groups rhetoric soon became an embarrassment to 
durenberger who was running for reelection in 1988 and to some 
other board members 
durenberger fired hewitt that spring just as his difficult 
campaign against hubert h skip humphrey iii was gearing up 
hewitts antagonistic style had aliented the elderly and made an 
enemy of the aarp durenberger said recently 
the subsequent change in tone moved boston globe columnist bob 
kuttner to write late last year that the generational equity issue 
had come so to speak of age 
they certainly appeared to be less strident and shrill and 
immature in their approach said families usas pollack 
but the senators difficulties with hewitt and age were far from 
over 
the senate ethics committee last year began investigating 
durenbergers financial conduct including charges he used a book 
contract to launder speaking fees and that drove away the 
contributors who underwrote ages 400000ayear budget says 
penny 
and in january the trade magazine podiatry today published 
hewitts allegations that durenberger muzzled the groups staff and 
tried to divert money to a minnesota age chapter to assist his 
reelection campaign 
nobody wants to support an organization that doesnt have 
anything to say it has had nothing to say in the last year 
hewitt said 
durenberger who turned the chairmanship over to fellow 
minnesotan penny in december denounced hewitt as a liar and 
other board members say the allegations that age was used for 
political gain were ridiculous and unfounded 
but the damage was done 
with all the controversy involving the senator which led to a 
diminished fundraising capacity you add to that the allegations 
made against the senator that were directly tied to his age 
leadership and it made fund raising virtually impossible said 
penny 
the 8000 in donations received after he shut down the 
operation will go toward paying off bills left over from recent 
conferences 
in the meantime lamm has asked the board for time to find 
someone willing to run the organization with little or no pay so 
age can at least continue sponsoring conferences on generational 
issues 
somebodys got to be the voice of realism said lamm 
thats what age was thats not granny bashing

researchers are looking into how well the 
elderly adjust in the sun belt without the support of family and 
friends they left behind in the north 
the case western reserve university study tracks 800 people over 
75 who moved from northern cities to a clearwater fla retirement 
community 
we think the results would help health care professionals to 
see what the needs of old people are who have relocated and to 
counsel people as they plan relocation said eva kahana who 
chairs the sociology department and directs the study 
it would also help counsel families it would either help 
reassure them that the social support networks that people develop 
in these communities are adequate or what kind of help is 
available we would be able to develop guidelines for doctors 
social workers and families in having a more realistic picture of 
what to expect 
her study is a spinoff of a 1984 case western survey in which 
150 people in their 60s or early 70s who had just moved to florida 
were asked how stressful the move was and how they were faring 
researchers followed them for a year 
ms kahana said researchers found that the majority were 
satisfied with their choice that they didnt miss very much their 
home communities or the people they had left 
the question that remains is whether those findings continue 
as they get older she said 
for the new study field workers are interviewing people over 75 
in the clearwater community which ms kahana would not identify 
the 800 interviews should be finished by the end of april 
residents are asked about lifestyle mental and physical health 
and longdistance communication with family and friends they also 
are asked to what extent paid helpers or agencies are used to get 
groceries clean houses do yardwork or help them meet appointments 
or activities 
researchers will keep in touch with the same people for eight 
years 
we should not make the inference that relocation to the 
sun belt is good for people period ms kahana said it may be 
that in the short run it works out very positively but once they 
become frail they would be missing the natural supports of the 
family 
but one of our hypotheses is that the neighbors and friends 
in the new community take on the role of family members 
we dont know the extent to which elderly people can make deep 
friendships late in life were going to be looking in depth at 
that how friends and neighbors help one another 
in 1970 about 53000 ohioans aged 60 and over left ohio that 
jumped to 86000 in 1980 the last year for which the census bureau 
has figures said charles longino associate director of the center 
of adult development and aging at the university of miami at coral 
gables fla 
in 1980 44 percent of the 86000 moved to florida ten years 
earlier 36 percent went to florida california drew 8 percent in 
1980 and 11 percent in 1970 
of the countrys 226 million people in 1980 356 million were 
at least 65 and about 5 percent of that age group moved out of 
their states longino said florida drew more of the elderly than 
any other state with about 437000 people in 1980

a geriatric leadership project is 
training health care workers to meet the special needs of older 
indians 
this is a vast new field thats really new to indian health 
care said bernard long who heads the gerontology program at 
sioux san hospital in rapid city 
the aberdeen area indian health service which serves the 
dakotas nebraska and iowa is the only one with a program aimed 
specifically at the needs of the elderly long said the project 
includes two seminars this year for nurses aides and other 
healthcare workers both indian and nonindian 
what were trying to do is sensitize service providers to 
expand their knowledge about the special needs of indian elders 
said long for example the way you touch people you have to be 
aware of the culture 
elders are held in high esteem in the indian culture but 
geriatric health care for indians has had a low profile thomas 
stenvig an ihs program manager in aberdeen said 
the elderly have not received a whole lot of focus as a 
population in health care he said what were doing with 
indian health care really mirrors what is happening nationally 
as the percentage of older americans grows increasing emphasis 
will be placed on geriatric health care among all groups of people 
long said adding that 13 percent of the nations population is 65 
or older the figure for clients of the ihs which has 13 offices 
covering the united states is 6 percent and growing he said

when elizabeth goucher moved to a 
retirement community two years ago she asked herself questions 
many people would rather not 
should doctors keep her on lifesupport systems if she became 
terminally ill would she donate her organs after death which 
funeral home should she use 
residents and staff of duncaster a residential care center for 
the elderly have written a booklet to help people answer some of 
the disturbing questions about death and terminal illness 
choices explores issues from arranging a funeral to living 
wills documents that indicates a persons feelings about 
prolonging life through the use of artificial lifesupport systems 
to setting up a trust and designating power of attorney 
a committee of seven duncaster residents and staff members spent 
more than a year talking with attorneys and other experts to 
produce the booklet which was published last month 
patricia b copp director of resident services at duncaster 
said she thinks planning for death is not as unthinkable as it once 
was 
for a long time this was a nono but now its a hot 
topic copp said these people were making plans for the rest 
of their lives when they came here and the rest of their lives 
includes death they decided they wanted to have strong input in 
the decision of how things would be handled at and after death 
goucher 67 who helped write choices acknowledges that 
some older people may not be comfortable planning for their deaths 
some people go through life with their heads in the sand 
because they have someone else to take care of these things 
but ive seen what can happen when people dont make these 
provisions said goucher a retired social worker in psychiatric 
hospitals

is it plausible that plants like people do 
better in congenial settings and that insect pests avoid 
distasteful things concede the possibility and you really should 
try companion or repellent planting 
does it work 
ive come to believe in it absolutely says jim johnson of 
phoenix president of the arizona herb association i havent 
used chemical pesticides in my garden for five years and im 
convinced plants grow best among their friends 
jane haynes of suburban fountain hills another expert on herbs 
says she reacted with enthusiasm when first hearing of the idea 20 
or 25 years ago but im still not satisfied it happens that way 
much as id like to 
one thing is sure collegetrained horticulturists no longer 
burst into gales of laughter when people say things like they never 
plant peas near onions or they believe marigolds deter certain 
pests and basil helps tomatoes grow definitive scientific studies 
are in their infancy however 
in my landscape i try to avoid chemicals but dont hesitate to 
use them if natural forces seem to be losing or if theres no 
known natural control and my records over the years seem to show 
some plants do better or worse near others 
the rodale folks in emmaus pa publishers of organic gardening 
magazine began popularizing the companionrepellent theory a 
couple decades ago 
details are spelled out in the encyclopedia of natural insect 
and disease control published in 1984 by rodale press and 
available in most bookstores 2495 hardcover even if you 
question the concept this is an excellent reference on how to work 
with nature and minimize toxic chemicals 
author roger p yepsen jr suggests the benefits of companion 
planting may be due to the increased health of vegetables growing 
near their friends insects typically pass by healthy plants 
preferring to pick on weak or sick plants 
why are companionate plantings healthier yepsen continues 
perhaps because the plants make complementary demands on the 
environment for instance the compatibility of celery and leek can 
be traced to the uprightgrowing leek enjoying the room and light 
near the bushy celery plant or the roots of two friendly plants 
may occupy different strata of the soil as do those of swiss chard 
and beans 
the book lists many repellent plantings such as rosemary vs 
snails and slugs spearmint vs ants and garlic vs aphids 
garlic it says helps out no matter where you plant it and 
keeps the potato bugs bean beetles and stem borers from achieving 
pest status but yepsens main thrust is that a delicate balance of 
life forms exists in any landscape and troubles develop when you 
upset the balance between pests and beneficial forces 
to illustrate how the world changes i recall an incident 
involving my college professor in agricultural pest control he was 
an imposing physical specimen a former pro football end one day a 
little bug invaded his demonstration garden ohmygod a bug he 
cried he literally shook as he drenched it with ddt a pesticide 
outlawed a decade or so later 
johnson believes insects follow smells a cabbage worm is 
attracted by the scent of cabbage and a tomato worm by the scent of 
tomatoes for example 
so he plants garlic and other members of the onion family 
throughout his garden and flower beds to confuse insects and uses 
various herbs around specific plants 
while i dont grow a lot of tomatoes maybe a halfdozen 
plants i havent had a tomato worm in five years by planting a 
lot of garlic cloves the worst that can happen is ill have a lot 
of nice garlic he says 
johnson also grows basil next to the tomatoes reasoning they 
like each other what about garlic and roses 
i think roses like garlic better than garlic likes roses he 
says but no plants seem to like fennel although bees seem to 
love it since i want to draw bees for pollination i grow fennel 
but plant it away from everything else 
haynes says she has tried to keep track of companion plantings 
for about 20 years and remains unconvinced 
theres so many possible variants i dont see any big 
differences take planting marigolds to deter nematodes how do you 
know for sure you have nematodes or that marigolds did any good 
shes sure however that the moon influences gardening she 
propagates her herbs by inserting cuttings in water 
i get roots more quickly four to five days quicker before a 
full moon than after one and they seem to be much stronger too 
moon gardening has been around for generations of course many 
believers will not plant or prune or even turn the soil without 
checking an almanac the theory is that the moons gravitational 
pull influences fluids in plants just as it does the ocean tides

if you own a second home in another state for 
vacation or investment purposes or if youre thinking about buying 
one make certain its included in your estate planning experts 
say 
when considering multiplehome ownership in your estate plan 
its important to understand the term domicile essentially 
domicile is legalese for primary residence while it is possible to 
have more than one residence a person legally can have only one 
domicile at a time 
if its not certain at the time an individual dies where his or 
her domicile is the intent of the will could be subverted the 
heirs may not receive the property rights intended by the decedent 
and the tax situation could be greatly complicated 
in fact courts have held an individuals estate to be subject 
to double taxation under the estate laws of two states because each 
state considered the dead person to be domiciled there 
consider an individual who has homes in arizona a community 
property state and minnesota a commonlaw property state the 
manner in which property is distributed at death is vastly 
different under each type of property system so if the owner dies 
and there is confusion as to where his or her domicile is 
settlement of the estate can be complicated 
what constitutes a domicile may appear obvious at first it 
isnt 
traditionally domicile has been defined as a place where a 
person establishes his or her permanent residence but many states 
have laws that define domicile as a location where a person intends 
to establish his or her residence for the time being 
in todays mobile society it is not unusual for a person to 
have homes in several states conduct business in a multistate 
area or move from one state to another beause of a change in 
health employment marital status or retirement therefore the 
definition of domicile becomes blurred 
although most individuals live most of the year where they are 
domiciled the residence does not necessarily determine domicile 
other factors that may be considered 
how long has the individual lived at the primary residence 
where does he or she transact business 
where does the individual maintain community or professional 
affiliations 
what is the individuals motive for living in particular 
state evasion of creditors for example may negate an 
individuals claim to domicility 
if you own a vacation home or investment property in a state 
outside your home state i suggest you consult an attorney then 
consider the following if domicile is unclear 
if you own residence in more than one state transfer or sell 
any unnecessary real estate holdings not located in the same state 
as your domicile 
transfer all tangible personal property including household 
furnishings and cars to the state in which you want to establish 
domicile 
transfer savings checking accounts cds and if possible 
iras and other retirement accounts to the domicile state 
obtain insurance coverage in the domicile state on personal 
property cars and houses do not continue insurance coverage 
through an agent in the state of nonresidence 
if the state you want regarded as your domicile state has a 
legal form declaring domicility file one 
if you do not have a will execute one in the state in which 
you want to establish your domicile or if you have a will that 
does not reflect your current domicile have a new one executed 
including a clause revoking all prior wills in other states 
register to vote in the domicile state and vote at the 
earliest opportunity thereby reinforcing your intent to establish 
residency 
i do not discourage owning homes in more than one state but it 
is important to clarify which state is the domicile because if 
there is any question about it the vacation home that produces so 
much pleasure now may later cause tremendous inconvenience to you 
and expense to your heirs

opportunity for her sixthgraders that would span generations

she gave it a try 
once a month pupils walk residents of the jordan plaza to the 
school cafeteria for a meal 
senior citizens feel isolated at times when they cant get 
out ms cordingly said they have enjoyed the interaction 
they have expressed many times that its like a breath of fresh 
air 
but it has been anything but a oneway street once friendships 
were established pupils went beyond the luncheons by visiting 
helping change light bulbs or running errands 
most of the residents attended carver many years ago ms 
cordingly said the students are intrigued with how life was 50 
years ago they see them growing old and it causes them to think 
about their future 
sixthgrader vicki nelson said her senior friend john furch 
talks to her all the time about school and growing up 
he likes to talk and i like to talk he likes to eat and i 
like to eat we like a lot of things together vicki said he 
tells me neat stuff not really stuff you need for education but 
stuff you just learn 
taylor nunley a resident at jordan plaza said he was surprised 
how much the children talked he said most children he has dealt 
with in the past were very reluctant to talk to old people 
theres not as big a generation gap as there used to be in the 
60s and 70s nunley said it seems as though the wall is 
dwindling down we need each other

about to sit back and let someone else play with what is in effect 
our money 
first city houston the banks main subsidiary is the largest 
usowned bank on a list of top unsecured creditors included in 
drexels bankruptcy court filing last tuesday first city is owed 
25 million 
meanwhile a newspaper reported that drexel paid as much as 350 
million in bonuses to its executives in the weeks before it filed 
for bankruptcy protection some top executives received payments of 
more than 10 million the new york times said in wednesdays 
editions 
drexel spokesman steven anreder declined to comment on the size 
of individual bonuses the payments were determined last year and 
were part of running the firms business the times quoted anreder 
as saying 
if we didnt have bonuses we wouldnt have had anybody 
working for us he said 
representatives of drexels creditors plan to examine the 
bonuses to determine if they could be recovered during bankruptcy 
proceedings the times reported 
us trustee harold jones who is supervising the bankruptcy 
case has set an organizational meeting for the creditors for feb 
27 in new york 
the chapter 11 filing allows drexel to manage with the judges 
approval its dismantling creditors could seek to force drexel to 
liquidate under chapter 7 where the companys control over its 
dissolution would be sharply reduced 
people are going to be considering the pluses and minuses of 
chapter 11 vs chapter 7 said margaret shearer deputy general 
counsel of ambase corp whose home capital services inc 
subsidiary is the second largest unsecured creditor at 427 
million thats a major issue 
schopf said creditors want to make sure drexel is receiving fair 
value for any asset sales and transfers and to determine whether 
drexel insiders have benefitted from them 
drexel attorney alan miller said the subsidiaries want to get as 
much as possible from asset sales because unsecured creditors will 
have priority in the bankruptcy over employees 54 percent stake in 
the parent company 
the people who are here at drexel who are winding down the 
business of the subsidiaries have a vital economic interest in the 
success of the winddown miller said 
drexel said tuesday it had liquidated 82 percent of its 
securities inventory selling all but 86 billion out of 474 
billion in holdings the sales include government highgrade 
corporate mortgagebacked municipal and junk bonds as well as 
equity and convertible securities 
our objective was to maximize the asset values for creditors 
and shareholders and it could only be done through an effective 
liquidation accomplished at market prices drexel said in a 
statement 
in its filing drexel listed more than 2000 total creditors 
assets of 37 billion and liabilities of 289 billion 
drexel last week fired most of its 5300 employees spokesman 
steven anreder said tuesday about 1700 workers remained to finish 
winding down the firms operations employees also are being 
allowed to use drexels offices temporarily to search for new jobs 
creditors may have a difficult time quickly gaining details 
about the assets of drexels parent us bankruptcy judge howard 
buschman iii last week gave the company a 90day extension to file 
a comprehensive account of assets and liabilities 
first city filed motions tuesday requesting the judge to 
reconsider the 90day extension and to compel an examination of 
drexels assets schopf said buschman scheduled a march 1 hearing 
to consider the motions schopf added 
it seems to me we should get whatever information is available 
now rather than having it tied up with a ribbon in 90 days he 
said 
other creditors said they would seek to interview drexel 
executives soon to investigate among other things what caused the 
bankruptcy filing 
well be looking at not only drexels current situation but 
probably the circumstances leading up to the bankruptcy filing 
said dewitt bowman chief investment officer for californias 
public employees retirement system which is owed 25 million

the powerful investment bank first boston corp 
says it may abandon some businesses as part of a restructuring that 
provides yet more evidence of the hard times on wall street 
first boston said last friday it was phasing out its 
fixedincome futures brokerage business in chicago and laying off 
29 employees 
in response to reports that further layoffs were expected the 
privately held firm said tuesday it was conducting a rolling 
review of its businesses and was considering eliminating other 
minor operations first boston denied that any major cutbacks were 
imminent though 
we will in the future increase our emphasis in certain 
business areas and decrease our emphasis in others first boston 
president and chief executive john m hennessey said in a 
statement as we did friday we may decide to exit certain narrow 
and discrete business lines 
the wall street journal reported tuesday that some executives at 
first boston which has about 5000 employees expect the 
restructuring to cause hundreds of layoffs rumors that the firm is 
on shaky financial ground also have been circulating on wall street 
spokesman fred garcia said first bostons financial backing was 
strong with nearly 2 billion in capital he said standard amp poors 
corp and moodys investors service had reaffirmed the investment 
banks credit ratings in recent weeks 
nevertheless garcia said the firm was considering selling a 
bridge loan it had made to ohio mattress co to help finance a 
buyout of the company last year the company scrapped plans to 
issue 475 million of junk bonds to raise longterm funds last fall 
because of weakness in the junk bond market 
garcia maintained that first bostons review included some 
hirings such as the recent addition of four top bond traders who 
had left salomon brothers inc to form their own firm 
the strategy is to be very strong in markets where we can add 
value for our customers he said we dont want to be in 
lowmargin commoditized businesses 
the strategy implies the firm will emphasize stronger 
relationships with fewer clients garcia added 
first boston went private last year when it merged with its 
londonbased sister company financiere credit suissefirst boston 
in a 11 billion deal the combined entity cs first boston inc 
is 45 percent owned by credit suisse the swiss bank holding 
company 
the investment banks strengths are in mergers and acquisitions 
stock and bond trading and underwriting and merchant banking 
according to securities data co first boston was second on 
wall street in merger advising last year the same as in 1988 
posting gains in both the number of deals and their value its 
stock underwriting increased by 26 percent and the firm moving the 
firm up a notch to third place on wall street 
our market share in highmargin businesses such as equity new 
issues and mampa continues to be strong hennessy said in the 
statement 
furthermore our european and pacific enterprises also started 
the year strong both in terms of market share and profitability 
following a very good 1989 the statement read 
still analysts said first boston like other wall street 
houses is likely to be hurt by a slowdown in underwriting and 
mergers as well as a lingering decline in stock and bond trading 
following the 1987 stock market crash 
perrin long of lipper analytical services said more layoffs 
would not be surprising given the general weak market conditions 
first boston laid off 200 workers last spring 
because of credit suisses strength and its in involvement in 
the subsidiaries activities analysts do not expect first boston 
to face the kinds of problems that led the parent of drexel burnham 
lambert inc to seek bankruptcy court protection last week 
the filing occurred after drexels parent strapped for cash in 
part by the drop in value of its holdings of junk bonsd defaulted 
on shortterm loans 
from what i can gather its a fairly integral part in the 
strategy of credit suisse to be in these businesses said 
lawrence eckenfelder of prudentialbache securities inc i would 
think if they had trouble it would be more where the banks have 
to shore them up if necessary 
garcia said he did not know the size of the ohio mattress bridge 
loan first boston was considering selling although analysts say it 
totals at least 450 million he also said first boston had set 
aside provisions last year to cover potential losses on the firms 
bridge loan to the us retailing arms of campeau corp and its 
holdings of bonds issued by those companies 
first boston said last month its exposure to federated 
department stores inc and allied stores corp which have filed 
for bankruptcy reorganization was 293 million

georgiapacific corp says it is bolstering its 
ability to compete in the global market for paper and wood products 
with its 5 billion takeover over great northern nekoosa corp 
companies are becoming larger through mergers and 
acquisitions theyre as a result becoming more efficient 
lowercost producers and this is occurring all over the world 
georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr said in a telephone 
interview 
hahn spoke tuesday after his company settled a fourmonthlong 
battle and agreed to acquire great northern for 6575 a share 
the acquisition will create the nations largest forest products 
company one that will be well positioned to deal with increasing 
competition from companies in new zealand japan canada and 
scandinavia analysts and company officials said 
size alone is not enough to help you guarantee your success 
but it helps said clarence brown a forest products consultant 
for shearson lehman hutton inc 
its a very capitalintensive commodityoriented and cyclical 
business with an increasingly international flavor and getting more 
so and the fellows that arent willing to compete on a global 
basis probably wont be around in another 10 years or wont be 
growing too fast 
great northern had fought hard to remain independent since 
georgiapacific launched its first bid of 58 a share on oct 31 
but its resistance began to waver after the bid was upped to 63 
then gave way during negotiations in recent days that produced 
agreement on the takeover price 
the time has come for great northern nekoosa to join 
georgiapacific nekoosa chairman william r laidig said in a 
statement i encourage our employees to work as enthusiastically 
with their new associates as they have in the past to make the 
combined concern the best in the industry 
besides paying 6575 for 57 million common shares outstanding 
georgiapacific will take over 13 billion in debt 
georgiapacific has lined up bank loans to finance the deal 
the agreement cancels all litigation between the companies and a 
march meeting at which shareholders were to consider replacing 
great northerns board with a slate nominated by georgiapacific 
great northerns stock rose 150 a share to 6537 on the new 
york stock exchange tuesday georgiapacific fell 137 to 4375 
a share 
atlantabased georgiapacific had 10 billion in sales last year 
from its wood products and building materials operations 
great northern based in norwalk conn makes paperboard 
packaging and uncoated printing paper and has 4 billion in sales 
both companies make newsprint and groundwood paper and have 
significant timber holdings 
the combined companys annual sales will be about 30 percent 
greater than its closest us competitors weyerhaeuser inc and 
international paper co 
during antitrust hearings in federal court in bridgeport conn 
hahn said the new firm would be able to better adjust its machinery 
to the types of paper and cardboard being made and would reduce 
shipping costs by having mills and factories closer to customers 
the combined company will be an even stronger company better 
able to compete in what were confident will be increasingly 
competitive global markets hahn said 
brown of shearson said the combination would strengthen the 
companies in a market that increasingly is measured in global 
terms companies like new zealands fletcher challenge and japans 
jujo paper co have boosted their presence in north america through 
acquisitions and joint ventures he said while virginiabased 
james river corp has increased its presence in europe 
i think those parties happen to be outstandingly capable and 
successful paper makers who will probably represent a typical two 
plus two equals five situation brown said of great northern and 
georgiapacific 
great northerns hopes of independence took a dramatic turn for 
the worse after two recent setbacks 
georgiapacific sold off some check paper operations removing 
the most serious antitrust question raised in courts in bridgeport 
conn 
also a federal judge in maine struck down some of the companys 
takeover defenses ruling that only twothirds approval was needed 
for great northern shareholders to oust the companys board rather 
than threequarters 
hahn said his company increased its offer to end the protracted 
court fights 
the sooner we can get on with combining the operations and 
gaining the efficiencies the sooner we get the benefits hahn 
said he reiterated that the company has no plans to sell off mills 
in maine as great northern alleged 
georgiapacific has agreed to honor contracts with great 
northerns 20000 union and salaried employees although some jobs 
will be cut to eliminate duplication hill said georgiapacific 
has 40000 workers

the makers of guess jeans staked their claim 
to millions in denim profits by alleging that the owners of 
jordache bought half of guess to pick its pockets of designs and 
boost their own slumping sales 
a superior court jury will determine whether to award 500 
million in damages to the marciano family which founded guess 
inc in 1981 and now seeks the return of half the firm bought by 
nakashe family which owns jordache 
marshall grossman representing the marcianos said in opening 
statements tuesday that the nakashe family breached their trust as 
part owners after purchasing half of guess in 1983 
you will see it was the nakashes plan and intention to take 
information for jordache and that is exactly what the evidence will 
show they did grossman told the jury 
grossman said the nakashes were supposed to have used trendy 
guess patterns for jeans made by a new guess division called gm 
gasoline inc but instead stole the patterns to make jeans for 
jordache enterprises ltd 
the nakashes were under the gun to develop new designs and were 
told by the sales department that the situation was critical 
grossman said 
an attorney for the nakashes denied the charges and said experts 
who compared the jeans sold under the labels of jordache guess and 
gasoline would say the designs were not copied 
the evidence will not show the nakashes intentionally took 
designs and copied them put their label on them and made money 
lawyer howard weitzman said 
this marks the second trial on the dispute between the 
frenchborn marciano brothers maurice armand paul and georges 
and the israeliborn nakashes joe ralph and avi 
a jury last year found the nakashes intended to steal guess 
designs for the jordache label 
the second trial is to determine whether to award damages to the 
marcianos and how much 
the marcianos are seeking more than 500 million in damages plus 
a return of the nakashes half ownership of guess the latter part 
of the decision is up to superior court judge norman epstein who 
is presiding over the trial 
also at issue is the division of a frozen account containing the 
nakashes accrued share of guess profits totalling more than 93 
million 
the marcianos also named as defendants a hong kong couple lee 
sec mon and his wife who manufactured jordache products in the 
british crown colony they allege the lees were to have 
manufactured gasoline designs but diverted materials to jordache 
the lees are unlikely to appear at trial because of an 
outstanding warrant for their arrest on customs violations 
involving garments imports according to a source close to the case 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
founded on an investment of 170000 guess last year sold 500 
million worth of blue jeans mens and womens casual wear 
swimsuits shoes watches eyeglasses and childrens clothing with 
the distinctive inverted triangle logo over the last four years 
guess profits have averaged 45 million a year

the tobacco business is taking a public 
relations pasting from antismoking activists for doing what 
effective marketers do identifying potential customers and giving 
them what they think they want 
all companies are looking for market niches said john c 
maxwell jr an analyst who follows the tobacco industry for first 
wheat securities in richmond va but some people just dont 
want people to smoke 
maxwell was referring tuesday to the outcry stirred by news 
reports that the rj reynolds tobacco co had been considering 
marketing a new cigarette called dakota to young women with no more 
than a high school education 
the plans were outlined in marketing documents being distributed 
by the advocacy institute a washington dcbased smoking 
opponent which said they were intended for reynolds officials 
declined to say how they were obtained 
reynolds based in winstonsalem nc confirmed that it 
planned to test dakota cigarettes in houston starting in april but 
said they were designed for men and women in an effort to compete 
against marlboro the topselling cigarette from reynolds rival 
philip morris usa 
the dakota disclosure comes only a month after reynolds 
cancelled plans to test a menthol cigarette called uptown that was 
to have been marketed mainly to blacks dr louis w sullivan 
secretary of the us department of health and human services and 
civil rights groups strongly objected to those plans 
critics said tobacco companies are wrong to target the poor the 
young and minorities with products that are believed to cause 
serious health problems 
edward popper a marketing professor at bryant college in 
smithfield ri said these are the groups that are showing the 
lowest declines in per capita smoking rates 
according to the us office on smoking and health the 
percentage of the population over age 20 that smokes fell to 291 
percent in 1987 from 407 percent in 1966 among whites the 
percentage of smokers fell 30 percent to 283 percent among 
blacks the decline was 22 percent to 335 percent 
the percentage of men who smoke has fallen much more sharply 
than women who smoke over the time frame and among women aged 
2024 the government said the percentage of smokers with some 
college education dropped 57 percent while the percentage with no 
more than high school education dropped about 11 percent 
while there have been a number of recent actions to make smoking 
offlimits in some public places such as restaurants and airplanes 
maxwell said people who criticize the targeting of groups more 
likely to smoke effectively are trying to ban a legal product 
the cigarette companies argue that their advertising is aimed at 
persuading people who smoke to switch to their brands 
but dr ronald davis director of the office on smoking and 
health said the tobacco industry is pushing a deadly addictive 
product on the most vulnerable groups in our society 
the outcry against marketing cigarettes to some groups for comes 
as tobacco companies post increasing profits despite declining 
sales volume 
maxwell said cigarette production fell 6 percent to 525 billion 
units in 1989 he said that number was depressed by a deliberate 
effort by reynolds to cut inventories and estimates that 
consumption fell by about 25 percent to 3 percent last year 
profits are up however because cigarette companies have cut 
costs and introduced more efficient equipment he said 
leonard lodish a marketing professor at wharton school at the 
university of pennsylvania said that by targeting groups that 
smoke more often than others the cigarette companies are no 
different than other marketers 
they are finding out what particular market segments want and 
are delivering products to them he said adding that im not 
sure this is the place to draw the line on whether to outlaw 
tobacco 
but philip wilbur director of the health advocacy resource 
center at the advocacy institute disagreed standard marketing 
doesnt involve selling a product that is lethal when used as 
intended he said 
and he said in the wake of the withdrawal of the uptown 
cigarette society may have reached a point where they have said 
enough

two electronic funds transfer systems that 
handle more than 1 trillion daily in interbank transactions need 
better security measures to guard against fraud or computer mishap 
a congressional study has concluded 
the study by the general accounting office called for beefedup 
security measures for the electronic funds transfer systems used by 
the federal reserve system and most of the nations banks fedwire 
and the clearing house interbank payments system or chips 
a related gao study noted that internal security weaknesses of 
stock exchange computer systems raise risks of sabotage that 
could literally bring securities trading to a halt even though 
the systems are well protected against attack by outsiders 
the gao found a number of internal control weaknesses at the 
computer centers of the nations two major stock exchanges and the 
national association of securities dealers which oversees the 
overthecounter market 
both studies were requested by rep edward j markey dmass 
chairman of the house energy and commerce committees subcommittee 
on finance which was to conduct a hearing today on computer 
security in the financial markets 
the banking study found that there have not been any reported 
incidents of fraudulent electronic funds transfers over the systems 
by the employees who operate or oversee them however the results 
of our review of the security measures in place to protect these 
systems from misuse have not been satisfying 
the report said it found 17 fedwire control weaknesses at the 
four federal reserve banks investigators visited in new york 
chicago dallas and san francisco weaknesses ranged from 
inadequate surveillance by cameras or motion sensors in critical 
processing areas to inadequate control of software that allows 
access to fedwire 
fedwire is the primary wholesale electronic funds transfer 
system used by the banking community to handle the payments banks 
make to each other within the united states in 1988 fedwire 
served over 11000 depository institutions and government agencies 
and processed transactions valued at 253 trillion 
the computer security report said officials at the new york 
stock exchange the american stock exchange the nasd and the 
securities industry automation corporation siac a jointlyowned 
subsidiary of both exchanges that operates computerized systems 
have implemented a wide range of security controls that protect 
their systems from the external threat of a hacker or virus attack 
and as a result the risk of such a threat is relatively low 
a hacker is a computer tinkerer who tries to gain access to 
computer systems without authorization a virus is a renegade 
program that once placed into a computer system can reproduce and 
spread among computer systems disrupting or destroying computer 
services 
but the most significant threat of potential tampering comes 
from the employees who have access to the exchange and nasd 
computer systems said the report 
the report recommended the sec periodically conduct or oversee 
independent assessments of the exchanges and nasds computer 
security programs develop written information security plans and 
policies and conduct periodic risk analyses 
in november the sec issued a policy statement asking exchanges 
and the nasd to review their computer systems periodically and 
conduct studies to assess their capacity and vulnerability 
the study found 10 security weaknesses at nasd including 
computer center staff performing tasks beyond their normal 
responsibility 
at the siac the study found three security weaknesses 
including contingency planning in the event of a computer virus 
attack 
the american stock exchange had no immediate comment tuesday 
evening a spokeswoman for the new york stock exchange sharon 
gamsin said the big board had not seen the gao report and would 
not comment until it had reviewed it 
charles justice vice president for automation at the nasd said 
some of the gao criticisms already had been addressed 
we agreed essentially that steps could be taken and we did 
take them he said they were taking a federal standard and 
were trying to apply it to a nonfederal operation we were kind of 
in technical violation but we simply dont follow that standard in 
terms of a substantive violation i dont think there was anything 
that was serious 
a fed spokesman said the agencys comments would come in hearing 
testimony by fed governor wayne d angell

digital equipment corp said it ran into 
technical problems with its new mainframe computer but said they 
were minor and would not delay shipments 
but the boston globe today said two wall street analysts said 
they received reports of troubles that could delay some initial 
deliveries 
separately the wall street journal reported today that digial 
faces the possibility of the first quarterly loss in its 32year 
history and is considering a voluntary severance program to cut its 
work force by 8000 
the new computers are called vax 9000s and digital planned to 
begin deliveries with the entrylevel model 210 during its fourth 
quarter which begins april 1 
digital said tuesday it found errors in an addon product which 
allows the model 210 to do vector processing 
dallas kirk a company spokesman said model 210s with the 
addon feature were not scheduled for delivery until the 1991 
fiscal year which begins in july 
analysts said they were concerned about larger problems that 
the vax 9000s were still being assembled in ones and twos and that 
concern would remain until product reliability was demonstrated 
the new computers will have an average selling price of 14 
million 
sales of the companys minicomputers have slumped and earnings 
dropped 39 percent during the six months ended dec 31 
meanwhile the journal said digitals president and founder 
kenneth h olsen wont rule out a loss in the companys third 
quarter ending march 31 
slumping sales and rising expenses as digital makes longterm 
investments in new products could cause the loss the newspaper 
said

computer maker after international business machines corp

a consortium formed by a japanese company and 
top management of aristech chemical corp has outbid a utah 
industrialist who dropped his yearlong quest to buy the company 
jon m huntsman said in a statement tuesday that after two weeks 
of studying aristech he decided not to top the 27 per share offer 
made by mitsubishi corp and the managers the 992 million bid has 
been endorsed by a special committee of directors 
huntsman had said he would offer more than 27 per share unless 
he found some materially negative information during his review 
he said in a statement he may make another offer if the 
mitsubishi bid falls through no other parties have expressed 
interest in making a bid for aristech 
huntsman started his quest for aristech by buying nearly 9 
percent of its stock last year 
he intially proprosed a friendly buyout of the company or just 
its polypropylene division both offers were rebuffed by chairman 
thomas marshall who said neither the company nor the polypropylene 
business were for sale huntsman then made a formal 25pershare 
bid in october only to see it rejected as inadequate 
shortly thereafter aristechs managers began working with 
mitsubishi on an alternative bid they submitted an initial offer 
of 26 per share in january then bumped it up to 27 after a 
committee of nonmanagement aristech directors set up an auction to 
determine the winning bidder 
under the offer aristechs managers would receive 65 million 
in cash and 299 percent of the companys stock 
huntsman did not participate in the auction he complained the 
company had unfairly denied him access to nonpublic information 
about the company and criticized management for inviting a japanese 
bidder while rejecting an american suitor 
however the aristech board allowed huntsman to begin an 
indepth review shortly after the auction and promised to leave the 
company open to a new bid

us automakers should move quickly but 
cautiously into eastern europe as the region liberalizes 
economically the head of west germanys daimlerbenz says 
edzard reuter chairman of the board of management for 
daimlerbenz ag the maker of mercedesbenz automobiles said 
tuesday he saw little chance of growth in the companys automobile 
sales in eastern europe but truck sales could benefit 
he said any move by daimlerbenz into eastern europe carries 
economic and political overtones 
automakers currently are faced with risks in eastern european 
investment because most of the currencies there are not convertible 
into west german marks french francs or us dollars 
reuter said western businesses must do everything they can to 
engage themselves in eastern europe as quickly as possible 
general motors corp last month announced it would begin 
building cars in a joint venture with the hungarian truckmaker raba 
in 1992 gm executives have said that czechoslovakia is the next 
mostlikely place for eastern european investment by the worlds 
largest automaker 
politically there is a risk for any west german company as 
debate over reunification of the split nation heats up reuter said 
we must be careful in trying to avoid these risks of a revival 
of nationalism in germany reuter said at a news conference 
before addressing the economic club of detroit we must try to 
supersede military security by some kind of economic partnership 
he said his company has begun talks with east german companies 
about joint ventures in vehicle manufacture railroad systems 
microelectronics and household goods 
many of those things with the exception of railroads are being 
discussed with japanese companies he said 
daimlerbenz has a marketing agreement with mitsubishi motors 
corp of japan which reuter hopes will boost sales of mercedesbenz 
automobiles in japan 
reuter said his company has doubled sales to 60000 cars a year 
in japan and would like more dealerships last year mercedes sold 
74851 cars in the united states 
reuter said even though he would like to see an expanded role 
for daimlerbenz in japan the company should move slowly because 
of japanese economic protectionist policies 
nevertheless he said we have no problem cooperating with 
them we should probably try to include the japanese in the global 
competition we will not hesitate to do so 
the us market is one place where mercedesbenz automobiles 
compete with japanese luxury cars toyotas lexus and nissans 
infiniti but reuter discounted the competition mainly because of 
price differences 
even if this sounds a little arrogant we never were 
frightened by lexus or infiniti he said what we offer even 
with a higher price is a far better deal than anybody can offer 
we are not going to reduce our prices on our models to face 
our competition 
base versions of mercedes automobiles range in price between 
32500 and 83500 the most expensive versions of lexus and 
infiniti cars sell for about 40000 
for the 1990 model year bmw and volkswagen both west german 
cut prices and eliminated rebates on many of the cars they sell in 
the united states 
several times during the news conference reuter said flatly 
there would be no price reduction for mercedesbenz cars

advanced mirco devices says it is 
selling a semiconductor plant in san antonio texas to sony corp 
for 55 million and a close look at how the japanese company 
manages chip factories 
experts said the deal announced tuesday is one of the first in 
which japanese technological expertise will flow into the united 
states rather than vice versa the deal also would give sony its 
first us chipmaking outpost 
under the agreement sony will take over two advanced micro 
devices factories in san antonio and hire about 650 amd workers 
the tokyobased company plans to refurbish one nowidle production 
line and use it to make advanced memory chips known as static 
random access memory chips or srams 
meanwhile amd will continue receiving the chip output of the 
other plant and its engineers will study how sony runs the 
refurbished factory 
you cannot succeed in this business if you are not in control 
of your production processes said jerry sanders amds chief 
executive 
amd with 11 billion in sales is the nations fifthlargest 
semiconductor maker about equal in size to sonys chip business 
for the past five years the two companies have collaborated on the 
development of new sram products 
the new agreement is not aimed so much at learning manufacturing 
technology but at learning how japanese companies use it sanders 
said those companies are able to get more chips with fewer defects 
from plants similar to those used in the united states 
amd has sent engineers to japan to study sonys techniques but 
the company said it expects to learn more by applying those methods 
alongside sonys engineers 
sony will benefit from the deal by acquiring the work force and 
management at the san antonio plans while amd will receive both 
cash and manufacturing expertise said david angel vice president 
of semiconductor research at dataquest inc in san jose 
others said that while the agreement means the sale of another 
american asset to the japanese amd saved us jobs and probably 
will improve its profitability 
sanders also expected the two companies to complete an 
additional agreement to develop a new complementary metaloxide 
semiconductor process that he said could double the number of 
circuits that can be put on a piece of silicon

economy minister antonio gonzalez 
will travel to washington within the next two weeks to lobby the 
bush administration and creditor banks for fresh loans to support 
recently announced economic reforms government officials said 
wednesday 
gonzalez plans to hold talks with senior officials at the us 
treasury international monetary fund and world bank the officials 
said 
the economic reforms unveiled by gonzalez last sunday aim to 
reduce inflation of 8314 percent during the past 12 months and 
its prime cause a fiscal deficit equivalent to about 14 percent of 
argentinas approximately 75 billion gross domestic product 
president carlos menems government hopes the measures which 
include new taxes the sale of state companies to private investors 
and a committment to deregulate the banking system will convince 
the imf to resume loan disbursement 
the imf last month suspended a second 230 million payment from 
a 14 billion citing argentinas failure to comply with economic 
targets including inflation tax collections and the fiscal deficit 
the imf decision prompted the us treasury world bank and 
private commercial banks to either postpone disbursement of 
existing credits or defer consideration of new ones

prices fell broadly in early trading on wall 
street today following sharp declines earlier on the tokyo and 
london stock markets and another negative report from washington on 
inflation 
rising interest rates which have spooked financial markets 
since the beginning of the year were again the primary unsettling 
influence today 
the dow jones industrial average was down 1690 to 257995 as 
of 1030 am est today after falling nearly 30 points earlier 
the broader market also slumped declining issues had a margin 
of nearly 8 to 1 over advancers on the new york stock exchange 
with 129 stocks rising 1017 falling and 316 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 2888 million shares after the 
first halfhour 
trading was active but orderly its busier than its been 
but nothing like in the mid80s said thomas jacobson a 
specialist with ac partners on the floor of the nyse 
prices fell after the labor department said the consumer price 
index for january rose 11 percent the biggest rise in 7 years 
the department said seasonal factors such as an increase in food 
and energy costs accounted for about 60 percent of the jump 
the cpi figure was the latest in what has become a series of 
negative reports on inflation it led analysts to again conclude 
that the federal reserve which has kept interest rates higher in 
an attempt to keep inflation in check would not move rates lower 
anytime soon 
wall street got some support from bond prices which despite the 
inflation report were holding steady the treasurys bellwether 
30year bond was up 116 point and its interest rate was unchanged 
at 866 percent 
some analysts said government bonds were being seen as a 
relatively safe haven for investors right now

the nikkei stock average the japanese markets major index fell 
more than 3 percent its third biggest singleday dive ever and 
worst since the worldwide stock market crash in october 1987

issues fell 116119 points or 315 percent closing at 3573433 
after having fallen nearly 565 points over the previous two trading 
days 
analysts attributed the markets weakness to increasing 
speculation that the bank of japan would raise its official 
discount rate the interest it charges for loans to commercial 
banks 
market watchers also blamed heavy computer programmed selling 
for the decline but said there was no panicselling

four media companies today announced they are 
banding together to launch the first directtohome tv satellite 
service that will beam high definition television and digital sound 
on lowcost napkinsized dishes 
cablevision systems corp national broadcasting co news corp 
ltd and hughes communications inc signed a memorandum of 
understanding to create the first high power direct broadcast 
satellite service in 1993 
the companies plan to invest about 1 billion in the joint 
venture including up to onethird in equity and 325 million in 
nonrecourse debt 
the service called sky cable will use the most powerful 
space transmitter ever launched for commercial communications the 
companies said in a written statement 
the highpower satellite system will make as many as 108 new 
channels available through the use of digital video delivery beam 
high definition television and standard video signals and deliver 
digital quality audio 
reception will be made by a flat napkinsized dish that can be 
mounted on a windowsill or rooftop and purchased for about 300 at 
consumer electronics stores the companies said 
a conventional 10foot backyard satellite dish costs 
approximately 2000 to 3000 
the new service will give americans a taste of the next 
centurys boundless range of video choices sharply enhanced 
picture reception and more realistic sound said stephen j 
petrucci president and chief operating officer of general motors 
corps hughes communications unit which will provide the 
satellite system 
the companies said the new satellite venture likely would be the 
first to introduce hdtv to the united states on a broad consumer 
scale 
under the agreement the equity will be divided evenly among the 
partners and will be paid into the venture in equal amounts over 
the next four years the remaining funds will be financed as 
working capital 
charles f dolan chairman of cablevision systems corp said 
sky cable will give viewers in areas not served by cable many of 
whom dont have the space or funds for oldfashioned satellite 
dishes a less cumbersome and more economical way to get 
highquality reception and a variety of programming 
australias news corp owned by media magnate rupert murdoch 
currently uses direct broadcast satellite technology in its sky 
television system 
we expect to apply our experience to the development of sky 
cable murdoch said 
bob wright president of general electric cos nbc unit said 
that while free overtheair broadcasting will remain the heart 
of nbc the venture will help further the companys programming 
and hdtv goals 
this system capitalizes on our substantial investment in the 
development of an american high definition television system as it 
will provide an important means of delivering advanced tv to the 
home wright said 
local cable operators will be able to market sky cables 
services along with their own the companies said sky cable will 
provide subscribers with a choice of multichannel packages a la 
carte subscription channels and payperview programming 
sky cables programming also will be packaged for noncable 
homes and as a supplement for homes with wired cable

consumer prices shot up 11 percent last 
month the biggest gain in 7 years the labor department said 
today in a report that reflected sharp increases in fuel and food 
costs lingering from decembers frigid weather 
the seasonally adjusted increase in the consumer price index 
the governments primary gauge of inflation at the retail level 
was the largest since a similar 11 percent gain in june 1982 the 
steepest gain last year was a 07 percent rise in april 
the increase represented an annual rate of 141 percent 
the jump following 04 percent advances in both november and 
december was foreshadowed by a 18 percent surge in wholesale 
prices in january but analysts said the spurts should be 
shortlived and inflation should return to more moderate levels in 
following months 
increases in food and energy prices accounted for over 60 
percent of the january advance the labor department said 
record monthly increases were recorded in the indexes for fuel 
oil and fruits and vegetables up 263 and 102 percent 
respectively and gasoline prices rose 77 percent 
fuel oil prices rose only 02 percent in december 
natural gas and electricity costs increased 03 percent in 
january following a 15 percent hike a month earlier 
dairy prices however were up 24 percent after increases of 
22 percent in december 17 percent in november and 14 percent in 
october analysts said the price hikes were due to last years 
drought which caused many farmers to slaughter milk cows 
gasoline costs which fell 21 percent in december rose 77 
percent last month as refineries switched to greater production of 
fuel oil 
overall energy prices were up 51 percent and food 18 percent 
however prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors 
considered a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures 
were up 06 percent after rising 03 percent in december it was 
the largest increase since a similar 06 percent gain in january 
1989 the previous high was 07 percent in january 1984 
a small residual influence from the winter also should keep 
food and energy prices up in february said donald ratajczak 
director of economic forecasting at georgia state university 
however our projections indicate that price moderation in these 
areas is likely later this year 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan in congressional 
testimony tuesday that sent financial markets into a tailspin 
also said januarys consumer price increase was temporary and that 
a reversal is apparently under way 
greenspan termed the january price spurt horrendous and said 
the risks of higher inflation in the present circumstances were 
larger than we should be willing to tolerate 
analysts interpreted greenspans comments as a signal that the 
federal reserve is intent on pursuing a tightmoney policy in an 
effort to restrain inflation and thus will not move anytime soon to 
push interest rates lower 
the message is that interest rates will stay high and perhaps 
go higher as the central bank keeps the economy throttled back to 
bring down inflation said allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co 
greenspan said the fed had lowered its overall inflation 
estimate for 1990 to between 4 percent and 45 percent down from a 
june forecast of 45 percent to 5 percent 
nevertheless he emphasized that inflationary pressures remain 
too high and he indicated the fed would continue its tightcredit 
and highinterest policies 
the bush administration is forecasting a 1990 inflation rate of 
41 percent 
before taking into account normal seasonal changes the consumer 
price index stood at 1274 in january that meant that a 
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing 100 in the 
198284 base period would have cost 12740 last month up from 
12110 a year earlier 
in a separate report the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation fell 07 
percent in january 
the decrease stemmed from a 11 percent increase in prices as 
measured by a special index for urban wage earners which was 
partially offset by a 01 percent increase in average hourly 
earnings and a 03 percent increase in average weekly hours 
average weekly earnings in january before adjusting for 
inflation were 33824 up 28 percent from a year earlier taking 
the 52 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over 
the 12month period real weekly earnings were down 23 percent 
the labor department offered these other details of price 
changes in january 
reflecting the overall food price increase grocery store foods 
advanced 29 percent their largest increase since a 71 percent 
rise in august 1973 nearly twothirds of the gain was due to 
fruits and vegetables 
fresh vegetables were up 226 percent including a 756 percent 
jump in the cost of tomatoes 
meat poultry fish and egg prices rose 19 percent including 
jumps of 2 percent for beef 13 percent for pork and 1 percent for 
fish poultry prices were up 06 percent and eggs advanced 91 
percent 
apparel prices were unchanged in january 
entertainment costs rose 06 percent 
housing expenses advanced 07 percent half of which was 
attributed to a 2 percent increase for fuel and other utilities 
medical care also was up 06 percent to a level 84 percent 
above a year ago 
transportation costs jumped 21 percent public transportation 
rose 19 percent reflecting increases of 13 percent in airline 
fares and 39 percent in intracity public transportation

the supreme court today upheld a federal law 
that allows abandoned rail lines to be used for nature trails 
the court in a case from vermont unanimously rejected 
arguments that the 1983 law known as the railstotrails act 
unconstitutionally deprives property owners of use of their land 
without just compensation 
justice william j brennan writing for the court said a 
separate federal law permits property owners to file a claim 
against the government to determine whether they are entitled to 
compensation 
brennan also said the railstotrails law is a legitimate 
exercise of congressional power aimed at encouraging the 
development of additional recreational trails 
the ruling could affect a large number of property owners some 
10000 miles of railroad rightsofway have been abandoned in the 
united states since 1985 
in other action the court 
limited the office of management and budgets power to order 
changes in federal jobsafety rules 
the court ruled 72 that the omb in trying to reduce paperwork 
for private businesses may not block or change rules made by other 
government agencies 
upheld federal regulations aimed at saving the government time 
and money when it mistakenly overpays some social security 
recipients 
the justices voting 54 in a case from colorado said the rules 
are a reasonable interpretation of the social security act the 
court rejected arguments that needy recipients could suffer undue 
hardship 
reinstated a 61 million award against the arthur young amp co 
accounting firm won by investors in the farmers cooperative of 
arkansas and oklahoma 
the justices by a 54 vote ruled that the financial notes held 
by the coops investors are securities as defined by federal 
law 
a federal appeals court had thrown out the award after ruling 
that the notes were not securities todays decision reversed that 
ruling 
the railstotrails law was challenged by j paul and patricia 
preseault who claim they own land on a rightofway abandoned by 
vermont railroad inc that claim is disputed by vermont officials 
who say the state owns the land 
the railroad discontinued service in 1975 over a 17mile 
stretch of its north burlington branch rail line in chittenden 
county vt 
if the preseaults own the disputed property they have a right 
under vermont law to use the land once rail service is discontinued 
and the railways easement automatically expires 
but the federal law an amended version of the earlier national 
trails system act allows for railroad rightsofway to be 
maintained for possible future railroad use while the land is 
converted at least temporarily to nature trails 
this practice known as rail banking is at the heart of the 
case decided today 
vermont entered into a lease with the city of burlington that 
allows the city to maintain the rightofway as a trail while 
preserving it for possible rail use 
citing the statecity agreement the interstate comerce 
commission rejected the preseaults bid to have the rail line 
declared officially abandoned 
the preseaults said the railbanking provisions are a sham aimed 
at disguising the true purpose of the federal law preventing 
reversion of rightsofway to property owners after abandonment 
the couple said the railbanking procedure is intended to 
disguise the fact that the rail lines have been abandoned 
brennan rejected that argument 
the law is not invalid merely because more draconian measures 
such as a program of mandatory conversions or a prohibition of 
all abandonments might advance more completely the railbanking 
purpose he said the history of congressional attempts to 
address the problem of rail abanondonments provides sufficient 
reason to defer to congress he added 
the preseaults said the 1983 law violates the constitutions 
fifth amendment which bars the taking of private property without 
just compensation and also said it interferes unlawfully with 
interstate commerce 
the case is preseault vs icc 881076

than 10 million 
among other legal actions investors filed a class action 
lawsuit against arthur young amp co which had audited the coops

about 280 of the jobs eliminated will be at apples headquarters 
the cupertinobased company will continue hiring workers for 
research and development and for its domestic sales force hirings 
also will continue in apples european and southeast asian 
divisions 
chairman john sculley blamed the layoffs on the slowing growth 
of the us personal computer industry 
analysts however have been criticizing the company for 
neglecting and even alienating some of its traditional 
customers 
we expect that the cost reduction steps we have identified 
will help ensure longterm profitability and will enable apple to 
continue to prosper in the 1990s sculley said in a prepared 
statement 
most everybody left at the company is making a big sigh of 
relief but apple will still have the problem of low morale in its 
product developing division that remains to be corrected said 
abigail christopher of international data co a market researcher 
in framingham mass 
so this will add some stability but theyve got a way to 
go she said in a telephone interview today 
on jan 15 apple said it planned to make an undetermined number 
of layoffs at the time it also froze the salaries of some 
employees for at least six months eliminated automobiles for 
usbased executives and cut back its profitsharing plan 
analysts have criticized apple for neglecting its lowend 
products particularly apple ii and the bottomoftheline 
macintoshes 
apple has been stressing more powerful more expensive models 
for corporate use and as a result its sales of the other models 
have plummeted in the past year analysts said 
the layoffs also follow a major restructuring that reportedly 
will see the departure of jeanlouis gassee apples new products 
developer allan loren who had been president of apples domestic 
division left the company because of sagging sales of its us 
division 
gassee was criticized for failing to introduce new lowpriced 
models of the macintosh and for the companys portable computer 
which many of the companys legions of stalwart users complain is 
bulky slow expensive and difficult to read 
the companys largest number of layoffs occurred in 1985 when 
it cut its workforce by 20 percent because of the recession in the 
personal computer industry in that cutback 1200 jobs were lost

into that already stuffed file of lessons we 
should have learned but didnt you may drop the latest data on 
oil imports which in january reached the highest level in 12 years 
not only are imports rising domestic production also is 
falling and is now lower than it was two decades ago 
petroleum imports in january reached 91 million barrels a day 
or more than half what is consumed in the united states a nation 
that has enormous fuel reserves available 
at the same time domestic crude oil production dropped in 
january to just 74 million barrels a day more than 5 percent 
lower than a year earlier and 20 percent lower than levels of about 
four years ago 
foreign oil sources are being relied upon more each year 
domestic sources less each year a remarkable trend in terms of 
history geography economics and national security among them 
the economic destruction in the form of inflation soaring 
interest rates and reduced domestic output that resulted from the 
oil embargo of the 1970s 
a vow by americans in all walks of life from the individual 
car owner and homeowner to the white house never again to be 
caught short of oil because of foreign limitations on supply 
the balance of payments problem oil imports probably account 
for as much as 50 billion of the gap between imports and exports 
a successful conservation effort by the american people one 
that seemingly could have been maintained almost effortlessly 
an assured market for domestic production made possible by the 
longterm growth of the american economy 
the demonstrated ingenuity of americans in developing more 
fuelefficient products to say nothing about alternative sources 
of energy 
incredibly there is little observable effort being made to 
rectify the situation by the federal government little mention of 
the situation is made in the detailed forecasts of economists 
on the edge of crisis the oil problem is discussed like the 
weather the assumption being that tomorrow no matter what anyone 
does there will be oil to burn as surely as there will be a sky up 
above 
the attitude is similar to that which preceded the crises of the 
1970s america suggests economist edward yardeni one of a 
relative few economists who include the problem in their analyses 
is as vulnerable now as then 
the impact of any increase in the price of oil or shortage in 
supplies is almost instantaneous and the reminder is as recent as 
now when oil prices still reflect the unexpectedly severe cold of 
december 
you cannot run factories homes schools or churches without 
fuel you cannot distribute food you cannot draw water in high 
buildings in fact without fuel you cannot even breath in some 
you cannot see in the night 
it is one of the more awesome items in the file of lessons we 
should have learned but didnt because in these modern times we 
couldnt live a day without it 
more awesome is that the problem can be ignored by so many at 
so many levels of society

exchange today amid nervousness over sharp falls on overseas equity 
markets 
wall streets early weakness coming on the heels of tokyos 
thirdworst selloff earlier and a sharp fall in new york tuesday 
unsettled london investors 
the declines came on fears of hikes in interest rates and 
worries about the bond markets 
but wall streets ability to recover some lost ground by the end 
of the european day gave investors some encouragement 
the dow is bouncing back which is probably the best news to 
happen in a long while one equity strategist said it probably 
isnt going to encourage people to buy any new stocks but it will 
likely staunch the selling flow 
said geoffrey lewis of the investment firm smith new court plc 
the market really behaved reasonably well considering the 
overnight falls both on wall street and tokyo the market took the 
falls in its stride 
but lewis added its obviously nervous to see how tokyo will 
react tonight 
the dow jones industrial average was off 1779 points at 
257905 as london trading ended 
at the london close the financial timesstock exchange 
100share index was down 173 points or 08 percent at 22597 
it finished just below its session high of 22617 points and 
better than the minimum of 22460 
the financial times 30share index was 152 points lower at 
17838 points at the close the financial times 500share index 
fell 1108 points to close at 122819 
volume was a relatively active 4278 million shares compared 
with 3774 million shares tuesday 
with sundays japanese general election now out of the way many 
analysts are convinced that japans central bank will raise its key 
interest rate soon 
recent rises in west germanys money market rates also have 
increased fears that the west german central bank might raise its 
key interest rates soon too 
one is keeping an eye worldwide on interest rates certainly 
in japan and over in germany lewis said

retail prices rose 11 percent last month the 
most in 7 years as consumers suffered from high food and fuel 
costs brought on by decembers frigid weather the government said 
wednesday 
leaving food and energy aside prices rose by 06 percent in 
january the steepest increase in a year and double the december 
pace 
the white house called the news disappointing and private 
analysts also expressed concern 
unfortunately this increase was not all food and energy 
said allen sinai chief economist at the boston co this 
indicates an entrenched inflation that will not easily recede 
the labor department said the increase in its seasonally 
adjusted consumer price index was the largest since a 11 percent 
gain in june 1982 the department said that 60 percent of the 
january increase came in food and energy prices 
the frigid weather a month earlier it was the fourth coldest 
december since records were first kept 96 years ago drove down 
fuel stocks and damaged fresh fruits and vegetables driving prices 
up 
analysts said food and energy prices should ease by march 
in fact were already beginning to see food and energy prices 
come down said lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser for 
the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa certainly starting with the 
march cpi number well see much smaller increases 
nevertheless there was concern that the socalled core 
inflation prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors 
rose 06 percent last month double decembers increase and the 
largest since an identical 06 percent jump in january 1989 
at the white house presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater called the jump disappointing news but said the 
administration expects the core rate to decline steadily over the 
year 
we are hopeful that this is a bulge that will be temporary in 
nature but inflation requires eternal vigilance and we remain on a 
policy of wanting steady growth with low inflation he said 
john silvia an economist with kemper financial services in 
chicago noted that in addition to food and energy all other 
categories posted increases except apparel which was unchanged 
the surprising breadth of the increases suggests that core 
inflation is 45 to 5 percent he said if were stuck there 
that means the fed is stuck 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told congress on tuesday 
that a reversal of the horrendous january consumer price rise 
was under way but added that inflationary pressures remain too high 
and indicated the fed would continue its tightcredit and 
highinterest policies 
greenspan also said the fed had lowered its overall inflation 
estimate for 1990 to 4 percent to 45 percent down from a june 
forecast of 45 percent to 5 percent the bush administration is 
forecasting a 41 percent inflation rate 
overall food prices advanced 18 percent while energy costs 
increased 51 percent including a record 263 percent rise for 
fuel oil gasoline prices rose 77 percent rise while natural gas 
and electricity costs combined increased 03 percent 
prices of fruits and vegetables also posted a record increase in 
january up 102 percent tomato prices rose 756 percent 
grocery store prices overall were up 29 percent their largest 
increase since a 71 percent rise in august 1973 meat poultry 
fish and egg prices combined were up 19 percent 
dairy prices continued their upward spiral rising 24 percent 
after increases of 22 percent in december 17 percent in november 
and 14 percent in october analysts attributed the hikes to last 
years drought which caused many farmers to slaughter milk cows 
economist silvia found a 07 percent increase in new car prices 
surprising in view of the sales incentives that were being offered 
in january 
given that we supposedly had rebates and prices rose about 
the same as during the prior month it suggest that rebates were 
being cut back or that price increases are sticking he said 
other categories showing price increases included entertainment 
costs 06 percent housing expenses 07 percent half of which 
was attributed to a 2 percent increase for fuel and other 
utilities medical care 06 percent and transportation costs 21 
percent 
before taking into account normal seasonal changes the consumer 
price index stood at 1274 in january that meant that a 
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing 100 in the 
198284 base period would have cost 12740 last month up from 
12110 a year earlier 
in a separate report the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation fell 07 
percent in january 
the decrease stemmed from a 11 percent increase in prices as 
measured by an index for urban wage earners but that was partially 
offset by a 01 percent increase in average hourly earnings and a 
03 percent increase in average weekly hours 
average weekly earnings in january before adjusting for 
inflation were 33824 up 28 percent from a year earlier taking 
the 52 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over 
the 12month period real weekly earnings were down 23 percent

avon products inc said wednesday it plans to 
sell its remaining 60 percent stake in avon japan to a private 
japanese mail order company and its president in a cash deal valued 
at 450 million 
the big beauty products company decided to withdraw from japan 
after concluding that it would be too costly to try to prosper 
there an intensely competitive environment in which avon has had 
little success expanding its market share 
friends of freesia co ltd and freesia president veji sasaki 
will pay 408 million in cash at the closing 338 million plus 
70 million in advance royalties another 42 million in advance 
royalties will be paid 18 months later avon said 
the proposed deal which must be approved by avons board of 
directors provides for avon to receive 5 percent in royalties on 
all avon products sold by avon japan for the first 18 months after 
completion of the deal after a year and a half avon will receive 
3 percent in royalties 
avon which started the japan subsidiary about 20 years ago 
sold 40 percent of the company or 271 million shares on the open 
market in 1987 for 220 million 
avon chairman james e preston said proceeds from the sale of 
its remaining interest will be used to reduce its 600 million 
debt avon last year reduced its 11 billion debt by 500 million 
he said 
john cox avons spokesman said the company decided it would be 
too costly to continue trying to succeed in a highly competitive 
market where it has only about a 4 percent market share cox said 
avons assets could be put to better use in other pacific rim 
countries 
japan has a mature cosmetics market with strong competition 
cox said to grow would involve heavy investing in advertising 
marketing plant and equipment 
avon japan earned 153 million in fiscal 1989 on sales of 285 
million the subsidiary employs 2000 workers and has 350000 
independent sales representatives about 25 percent of its sales 
are by direct mail 
freesia a private company with sales of about 180 million 
will retain current avon management and operate the company as a 
subsidiary avon will give freesia exclusive use of its 
trademark intellectual property rights and product technology 
for 10 years 
avon also will retain two seats on the board of avon japan and 
will provide consulting and product research and development 
services 
avons board will consider the planned transaction at the next 
regular meeting scheduled for march 1 
securities analysts endorsed the sale plan and said it would 
improve the bottom line of the new yorkbased direct sales company 
andrew shore of shearson lehman hutton inc estimated the sale 
will contribute about 15 cents a share to avons 1990 earnings 
it will go a long way to restoring the health of the balance 
sheet 
the companys financial performance has been scrutinized over 
the past year or so by several investors contemplating possible 
takeovers avon rejected outright acquisition proposals of 21 
billion from rival direct sales company amway corp of ada mich 
and of 285 billion from minneapolisbased investor irwin jacobs 
it also fended off takeover feelers from mary kay cosmetics 
another leading direct seller of beauty products 
a limited partnership including a subsidiary of mary kay corp 
the dallasbased privately held parent of the cosmetics marketer 
also has been building a stake in avon stock chartwell associates 
announced in late december that it had increased its holding to 87 
percent 
avon last week said it earned 546 million or 34 cents a 
share in 1989 compared with a deficit of 4045 million or 679 
a share in 1988 the 1988 results reflected 546 million in losses 
from discontinued operations sales in 1989 rose 8 percent to 33 
billion from 1988s 31 billion

drexel into bankruptcy said william g schopf jr general 
counsel of first city bancorp of texas inc which is owed 25 
million if thats true it would be something we would seek to 
reverse if possible 
schopf and other creditors said they would seek details about 
the payments from drexel executives during bankruptcy court 
proceedings 
also rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house 
energy and commerce committees finance subcomittee said the panel 
planned to look into the bonus payments in the coming weeks 
us bankruptcy judge howard buschman late tuesday granted first 
city a hearing on its motion seeking to force drexel to detail 
asset sales made in the liquidation of the brokerage subsidiary 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
drexel has sold nearly 40 billion in securities positions as 
well as other assets in its dismantling the firm still is trying 
to liquidate about 18 percent of its portfolio and sell equipment 
furniture and other assets 
the creditors could face difficulties because the securities 
subsidiary is not covered by the bankruptcy filing but they said 
they would seek to investigate the payments because of their size 
and timing 
it gives rise to concern as does any large transfer made 
shortly prior to the bankruptcy filing said wayne davis an 
attorney with a new york law firm representing several large 
creditors 
creditors may seek to recover payments made outside the normal 
course of business for up to 90 days before a bankruptcy filing 
the period stretches to one year for payments to company insiders 
sources said the bonuses totaled between 300 million and 350 
million but drexel spokesman steven anreder said the size of most 
of the cash payouts was determined in december before the firms 
financial problems became critical 
he said one executive chose to take his entire bonus in drexel 
stock the value of which was wiped out by the firms demise 
there was no sense of foreboding here at all anreder said 
it was only in the last week and a half that things were 
difficult but even then no one thought the firm would go under 
anreder said the bonuses were paid in december and early 
january the size of some of the payments was determined in early 
1989 he said 
we did what we believed we had to do competitively and it was 
within both the norms of what the longstanding practice had been at 
the firm and within the norms of the industry anreder said 
drexel insiders said some individual bonuses exceeded 10 
million with reports being circulated of payouts approaching 20 
million they contended the firm could have slashed its bonuses 
long regarded as among the industrys most excessive to save 
money the firm lost about 40 million in 1989 
they also said the payouts raised questions about managements 
handling of the firms deteriorating financial condition in the 
months leading up to the bankruptcy filing 
anreder said drexel reduced 1989 bonuses but he did not specify 
by how much most wall street firms cut the payouts by up to 20 
percent last year because of a severe securities industry business 
slowdown 
drexels parent sought bankruptcy protection feb 13 after it 
defaulted on 100 million in shortterm loans and banks refused to 
extend credit the firm had relied on such loans to sustain its 
capital base 
anreder said drexel aware of its financial problems late last 
year moved to shore up its standing through employee payments 
requiring executives making more that 200000 a year to take up to 
18 percent of their salary in company securities

earl i johnson of harris trust amp co in chicago the market

the dollar had little reaction to a government report showing an 
unexpectedly high 11 percent rise in the consumer price index in 
january even though increased inflation lessens prospects for 
lower interest rates which would depress the dollar dealers said 
they said the market already had anticipated higher inflation 
when federal reserve chairman alan greenspan testified before 
congress on tuesday 
the dollar was quoted at 16645 west german marks in london 
down from 16748 marks and 16725 marks in new york up from 
166835 marks tuesday

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca said 
wednesday that japan should be stripped of the teflon kimono 
image that implies its cars are better made than american autos 
but said chryslers new ad campaign along those lines didnt amount 
to japanbashing 
for the life of me i dont know why there seems to be this 
national inferiority complex iacocca told reporters on the first 
leg of a sixcity tour to showcase chrysler products and its new 
advertising campaign 
he spoke in a hotel ballroom before a display of chrysler autos 
ranging from the minivan and jeep to sports and luxury cars 
every time i pick up the paper i seem to read another story 
that reinforces the idea that anything made overseas including 
europe is somehow better than anything made in america he said 
were not going to let that kind of crap go unchallenged any 
more 
the nations thirdlargest automaker which last week reported a 
664 million loss in the fourth quarter of 1989 and a 658 percent 
drop in profits for the year is preparing a major advertising 
blitz with the theme advantage chrysler the message is that 
chrysler quality has improved sharply since the early 1980s and 
equals or surpasses its japanese counterparts 
the centerpiece is a 60second spot in which iacocca gives a 
boardroom pep talk to other chrysler motors chairman bennett e 
bidwell chrysler corp vice chairman gerald greenwald and other 
company executives seated around a table 
americans just dont understand the quality of our cars weve 
gotta get people to wake up to the truth iacocca says in an 
impassioned tone the truth is weve got advantages over the 
japanese in every car we make but nobody knows it and thats 
gonna change 
he insisted the campaign was not japanbashing but complained 
about media reports portraying japanese cars as superior and 
criticized as inadequate us government efforts to open japanese 
markets to american cars 
japan today is wrapped in a teflon kimono especially when it 
comes to cars he said maybe its time to just start peeling 
back the kimono a little bit 
the campaign will have failed if consumers primary reaction is 
theres iacocca japanbashing greenwald said were not 
angry at anybody were simply saying go look at the products 
iacocca said the initial commercial will hit the airwaves in 
early march 
chrysler is trying to cut costs by 15 billion this year 
through reorganization and layoffs it has closed its jefferson 
avenue plant in detroit and plans to close a st louis facility by 
midseptember 
iacocca said it was too early to say whether further cutbacks 
would be needed its an ongoing thing he said when we get 
to a billion and a half were going to keep looking

operation save chemicals the company was helped by an improvement 
in exchange rates interest and other corporate items 
manufacturing marine and marketing which include shells oil 
refining businesses reported higher earnings on a decline in 
sales the earnings rise however was attributed chiefly to 
inventory gains 
us refining operations were particularly depressed in the 
latest year analysts say the company was hurt by low margins in 
the us gasoline market and a missed opportunity in us heating 
oil sales where prices turned sharply higher at year end just as 
the company began a planned withdrawal from the market

jaguar plc the luxury british automaker dogged 
by an image of slipshod quality is recalling nearly twothirds of 
the cars it has sold in the united states since 1988 because of 
potential brake problems 
the 38315 models affected contain a highpressure hose that 
could rupture and spurt hot brake fluid onto an engine causing 
smoke fire and loss of braking power the automaker said the 
brake recall also affects 56000 jaguars sold in other countries 
in addition jaguar said it is recalling 38385 cars sold in 
this country dating to 1979 for defects that could cause the 
automatic cruise control device to jam raising the risk of crashes 
the company said it is unaware of any accidents or injuries that 
may have resulted from these defects which will be repaired free 
of charge owners will be notified by mail 
the recalls come at a particularly awkward time for jaguar 
which is suffering from a protracted slide in sales in its most 
important foreign market the united states just as japanese and 
german competitors are becoming more aggressive about selling 
luxury cars in this country 
the british company which recently agreed to be acquired by 
ford motor co has long been tainted by reputation for 
inconsistent quality temperamental cars and customer complaints 
about service 
in the brake recall dealerships will check the brake systems of 
all xj6 vanden plas and majestic cars sold in the united states 
for potential leaks the cruise control recall affects 1979 model 
xj12 sedans and 1982 to 1990 model xjs cars

from an unpaid personal debt 
in papers filed last week in the supreme court of ontario the 
bank said it was seeking funds from the toronto entrepreneur to 
recover some of its losses on a 150 million loan campeau defaulted 
on last month 
the national bank is the third canadian bank to sue campeau 
whose federated department stores inc and allied stores corp 
retailing divisions sought chapter 11 protection from creditors in 
us bankruptcy court last month 
campeau acquired both retailers in buyouts that depended heavily 
on junk bonds and the companies have been unable to generate 
enough cash to pay campeaus 75 billion in debt 
the other banks suing campeau are the bank of nova scotia and 
the bank of montreal 
the national bank loan was borrowed by a company controlled by 
campeau to buy securities in torontobased campeau corp campeau 
agreed to personally guarantee up to 50 million of the loan 
the bank already has taken possession of securities pledged 
against the loan but the market value of the securities has 
dropped to less than half the 150 million owed on the loan

of the company he founded in the 1940s when it took possession of 
campeau shares that had been pledged as collateral for the 150 
million loan 
when campeaus troubles came to light last september the news 
devastated the junk bond market and brought the takeover business 
to a near halt the drop in junk bonds also contributed to last 
weeks chapter 11 filing by drexel burnham lambert group inc

was ordered to report monthly on its troubled finances 
the casino control commission said it granted the license 
renewal to resorts international the parent company of merv 
griffins resorts casino hotel in atlantic city despite its 
bankruptcy proceedings 
the mere filing of a chapter 11 action does not in and of

stability acting commission chairwoman valerie armstrong said 
the bankruptcy action is but one albeit significant factor

it could become financially stable within the twoyear license 
period under a flat growth scenario

federal court in camden last november it is seeking approval for a 
reorganization plan from creditors and a federal bankruptcy judge 
resorts last month won 143 million from gamblers an 11 
percent drop from the 161 million registered in january 1989 
according to commission figures the casinos win for all of 1989 
dropped 64 percent to 2274 million compared to the previous year 
win is the amount of money gamblers lose and does not take into 
account expenses it is not profit 
under the flat growth forecast resorts will post a 500000 
cash deficit at the end of 1990 because of an extensive 
refurbishing program the commission said in its unanimous ruling 
the commission imposed conditions recommended by the division of 
gaming enforcement that resorts file monthly balance sheets income 
statements and statements of cash flow and working capital 
resorts officials also must advise regulators on a monthly basis 
of significant deviations from financial projections and from prior 
financial performance 
but the commission stopped short of requiring the casino to 
report daily or weekly or to set a specific cash balance that would 
trigger the imposition of restricted accounts to ensure that wages 
taxes and progressive jackpots are paid 
resorts president david c hanlon said he was pleased with the 
decision and confident the opening april 2 of the neighboring taj 
mahal casino would reverse the decline of the first gaming hall to 
open on the atlantic city boardwalk in 1978 
the taj mahal originally owned by resorts led to some of its 
financial problems as construction costs since 1983 until its sale 
to real estate developer donald trump in 1988 diverted money from 
resorts and its capital expenditures 
resorts reorganization plan seeks to shed about 400 million of 
927 million that griffin assumed to finance his november 1988 
purchase of the property from trump griffin sold trump the taj 
mahal in return

for allen i questrom its almost like going 
back home again to rescue the family from crisis 
questrom spent 23 years with federated department stores but 
quit when it was acquired by campeau corp of canada nearly two 
years ago with billions of dollars in borrowed money 
at the time he feared such an enormous amount of debt would 
force federated to drastically change its philosophy away from 
quality and more toward highvolume selling and priceslashing 
promotions not his way of running a retailer profitably 
now questrom is in charge of resurrecting federated and another 
of campeaus multibillion dollar debtfinanced acquisitions allied 
stores corp which both sought protection from creditors last 
month in the biggest retailing bankruptcy filing in history 
questrom has minimized his contact with the press since he took 
over feb 2 as chairman and chief executive of federated and 
allied but at a news conference to announce his new job he 
laughed when asked whether he thought the task ahead would be the 
biggest of his career 
yes i think thats safe to say he said 
his new boss federated stores inc chairman and chief executive 
officer g william miller was more direct 
if you hadnt said that i would have gotten out of here 
said miller a former us treasury secretary 
questrom 49 was hired away from neimanmarcus a 22store 
specialty chain based in dallas as an added inducement to help 
lead the rescue he will be paid 12 million a year although 
questrom has insisted thats not the reason he came back 
widely respected in the retail business questrom is known as a 
believer in oldfashioned fundamentals clean stores quality 
service merchandise appropriate to a shoppers income level in 
his view a store that sells 700 womens dresses for example 
should not be peddling 19 shoes 
questrom clearly faces an enormous problem because he will have 
to combine his philosophy with a strategy that produces more 
revenue cuts costs satisfies the bankruptcy court and appeases 
anxious creditors 
the massachusetts native began his tenure with federated in 1965 
as an executive trainee at the abraham amp straus chain and by 1973 
had become a merchandise manager later he ran both richs and 
bullocks two of federateds bestknown subsidiaries bullocks 
was subsequently sold and advanced to executive vice president 
then vice chairman of the company 
in may 1988 when campeau bought federated for about 66 
billion questrom turned down the new owners offer to make him 
chairman and moved to neimanmarcus 
when he was approached about coming back to federated after the 
bankruptcy filing in january he originally rejected the idea but 
evidently changed his mind because many acquaintances in the 
company pleaded with him to reconsider including a daughter of the 
companys founder 
questrom returns to work with federatedallied president james 
zimmerman both insist that the sister retailers with 260 stores 
and 100000 employees in 28 states can be healthy and profitable 
questrom zimmerman and miller said the biggest obstacle is the 
crushing debt burden of 77 billion that federated and allied 
assumed when campeau purchased the companies 
miller said some of that debt likely will never be repaid the 
most vulnerable creditors may be the holders of junk bonds that 
were used to help finance the campeau acquisitions 
questrom said he would concentrate at first on rebuilding 
confidence of merchandise suppliers to ensure that federated and 
allied can maintain their market positions in the spring season 
zimmerman said sales were off in the first two months of this year 
the challenge of competing against financially healthy retailers 
is a problem that questrom readily acknowledged 
obviously in the short term thats a key issue but i think 
were working very aggressively with our vendors to be sure that we 
do get deliveries on schedule he said ninetyeight percent of 
the vendors want federated to be successful theyre working 
towards that aim we all get the same benefit out of being 
successful 
questrom said federated and allied were streamlined prior to 
filing for reorganization to concentrate more on their core 
businesses 
we are a department store company now we were before a kind 
of a broadbased retail company i believe the talents of the 
organization now are much more focused questrom said 
really its for jim and i and the company to really just put 
the priorities in order and to focus our attention on running the 
business to benefit our customers and i think we can do it he 
said 
questrom said the reorganizations under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy laws give federated and allied one advantage in 
luring merchandise suppliers the supervision of the us 
bankruptcy court means companies that deal with federated and 
allied now receive first priority for payment over creditors who 
dealt with federated and allied before their jan 15 filings 
from a retail point of view or a vendor point of view this is 
the safest company to ship to today this is the place to be 
shipping in terms of making sure you get your payments questrom 
said 
a more natural advantage the company has is its geographical 
reach in some of the most important us metropolitan markets 
we own the major properties in each of those cities he 
said i think our competitive position will in fact come back 
to normal in the next 30 to 45 days

the states consumer protection chief called 
wednesday for federal inquiries into rising fares for air shuttle 
flights in the northeast which he said have soared by as much as 
102 percent in four years 
richard kessel director of the consumer protection board 
charged at a news conference that the trump and pan am shuttles 
were gouging captive passengers on their flights linking new york 
with boston and washington 
as far as air fares the skys the limit for the shuttle 
flights out of new york kessel said its probably becoming 
cheaper to send customers to the moon than to boston or 
washington 
on jan 3 he noted trump shuttle raised its oneway weekday 
fares by 20 percent from 99 to 119 and pan am followed suit 
moreover since the pan am shuttle started in 1986 its new 
yorkboston fares have risen by 83 percent and its new 
yorkwashington fares by 59 percent kessel said fares on the 
trump shuttle which billionaire developer donald trump bought from 
eastern airlines last spring have increased by 102 percent to 
boston and 72 percent to washington kessel said 
in the same period he said the consumer price index measuring 
retail inflation rose 143 percent 
officials for both shuttle services noted that jet fuel prices 
have jumped recently and more generally said their fares 
reflected their expenses 
we believe todays fares are justified based on the costs that 
are incurred in operating a shuttle service said pan am 
spokeswoman pamela hanlon 
trump shuttle president bruce nobles said we charge a fair 
price in relationship to our cost this gentleman does not 
understand the economics of our business he said referring to 
kessel 
kessel said the root problem was deregulation of the nations 
airline industry in 1978 which he said stripped protection from 
business travelers who have no practical alternative to the 
shuttles he called for investigations of the shuttle fares by 
congress and the us department of transportation

a former general partner of kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co who sued the cofounders of the leveraged buyout firm 
in a highstakes dispute over money has settled out of court for an 
undisclosed amount 
a document filed in a new york state supreme court feb 7 shows 
jerome kohlbergs claims against the company and the other 
partners henry r kravis and george b roberts have been 
discontinued with prejudice and without cost to either party 
the phrase with prejudice means those claims cannot be 
raised in any future lawsuit nonetheless the documents language 
suggests kohlberg could bring claims that may arise from the future 
conduct of the defendants 
the terms of the settlement evidently also require both sides 
not to talk about the matter publicly they declined to comment or 
even confirm a settlement had been reached 
the quiet resolution of this legal brawl came less than six 
months after kohlberg a pioneer in the business of debtfinanced 
takeovers known as leveraged buyouts slapped his expartners with 
the lawsuit 
he claimed the firm reduced his stake in several companies 
acquired while he was one of kkrs general partners kohlberg 
claims that violated an agreement he made with the firm when he 
left its management in 1987 the defendants denied the claim 
kkr is the leader in arranging leveraged buyouts in which 
companies are acquired with borrowed money repaid with their 
earnings sale of assets or a combination of both kkr holds the 
record for the biggest takeover in history the 25 billion 
leveraged buyout of rjr nabisco inc 
the firms operations a mystery to the public have made its 
partners enormously wealthy but some of the most recent deals have 
run into trouble because of difficulties in repaying or 
renegotiating debt 
kohlberg kravis and roberts formed their partnership in 1976 
with each serving as general partners who managed the firm and 
directed its acquisitions and investments 
kohlberg remained a general partner until 1987 when after a 
fallingout with kravis and roberts over the firms strategy he 
became a limited partner sharing in kohlberg kravis profits but 
not in its management 
among the deals undertaken while kohlberg was a general partner 
were the 1986 leveraged buyouts of consumer products company 
beatrice cos for 61 billion and the grocery chain safeway stores 
inc for 42 billion

oil companies have brought a technology 
learned offshore to the plains of south texas turning heartbreak 
field into a gusher of activity 
horizontal drilling a modern term for slant hole drilling 
once an illegal way of draining your neighbors oil has resulted 
in recordsetting flow rates from wells drilled in the pearsall 
field of the austin chalk a geological formation running northeast 
through texas from the mexican border to carthage into louisiana 
and beyond 
oil in the pearsall field is contained in narrow vertical 
deposits that make vertical wells more chancy that usual even 
successful wells have low flow rates extending the time it takes 
to recover investment 
with horizontal drilling however several deposits can be 
linked increasing both the chances of finding oil and the 
production once it is found the technique first used in undersea 
drilling for oil costs about twice much as an onshore vertical 
well but flow rates can be four to five times higher 
the pearsall field which covers parts of five counties 
southwest of san antonio is only one place where experts say the 
technology could be used 
meridian oil co has been using horizontal drilling in the 
bakken formation of north dakota since 1987 other older texas 
fields including parts of the mammoth permian basin of west texas 
and eastern new mexico are considered likely candidates as are 
some shallow california fields where so much gas has escaped there 
is nothing to carry the oil to the surface 
there are a lot of places in the united states where 
horizontal drilling will fit any place where you have a 
reservoir thats not continuous said jim roberts production 
vice president for oryx energy co credited with pioneering the 
technique in south texas oryx already has begun drilling 
horizontal wells in the bakken formation and the ellenburger area 
of the permian basin 
the texas railroad commission which regulates oil production in 
the state is considering expanding to the rest of the state new 
rules it put in place for the pearsall field 
a report from the bureau of economic geology at the university 
of texas says horizontal drilling holds significant promise and 
could add 11 billion barrels of easily recoverable oil to texas 
reserves an increase of more than 31 percent over current 
estimates 
while most of the attention has been focused on horizontal 
drilling other technologies also are enhancing discovery and 
recovery of oil at the same time concern again is growing about 
us dependence on foreign supply 
there is little chance that a major oil deposit remains to be 
found in the united states experts believe so explorers are 
returning to familiar fields using new technology to pump more oil 
out of old discoveries 
ninety percent of everything we get added to reserves is 
from existing fields said william fisher head of the bureau of 
economic geology who estimates us reserves of easily recoverable 
oil at about 100 billion barrels 
enhanced recovery can get 230 billion more barrels he said but 
only if the price reaches about 25 per 42gallon barrel the price 
now hovers around 22 and analysts dont foresee 25 for several 
years 
the technologies range from using a mixture of molasses and 
microbes to raise pressure in sagging wells to reevaluating 
seismic data to find missed oil deposits 
one company western resource technologies inc is pushing five 
methods it says it can use to turn dry holes and abandoned wells 
into new gushers 
we like to think of ourselves as the mel fisher of the oil 
patch said western chairman steven s mcguire referring to the 
celebrated undersea treasure hunter

northrop corp the builder of the b2 
bomber said it lost 166 million in the fourth quarter and 635 
million in 1989 largely because of high costs on fixedprice 
research and development contracts with the government 
the fixedprice accords have been costly for many aerospace 
giants mcdonnell douglas corp whose fourthquarter profits fell 
58 percent has run behind schedule in developing the c17 cargo 
plane and t45 navy training jet and lockheed corp showed about 
300 million in pretax fourthquarter losses because of unforeseen 
changes on a new submarinehunting plane 
northrop took a total of 240 million in writeoffs for such 
development losses in 1989 with 28 million of that in the fourth 
quarter about 81 million of the writeoffs were on development of 
radarjamming equipment and another 159 million on classified 
programs in northrops missiles and unmanned vehicles segment 
since early 1988 northrop has refused to accept fixedprice 
development contracts lockheed and rockwell international corp 
also refuse to do so saying the risk of unforeseen expenses is too 
great during the initial development of complicated programs for 
the military 
for the octoberdecember quarter northrop lost 166 million 
or 35 cents a share compared with a loss of 861 million 183 a 
share in the same period of 1988 sales plunged 232 percent to 
133 billion from 173 billion 
for the full year northrop lost 635 million or 135 a 
share compared with earnings of 1042 million or 222 a share 
in 1988 the 1988 profit figure included a favorable onetime tax 
adjustment of 1351 million sales fell 95 percent last year to 
525 billion from 58 billion in 1988 
separately northrop said it had completed the previously 
announced sale of twin office towers in century city that house its 
headquarters for 218 million in cash northrop whose total debt 
had been 12 billion used the proceeds to reduce its shortterm 
debt to 424 million the company is leasing back its headquarters 
space 
the sale yielded a pretax gain of 136 million of which 102 
million will be recognized in 1990 and the rest spread over the 
next 10 years aftertax earnings for the first quarter of 1990 
will benefit by 67 million or 142 a share the company said 
fourthquarter revenues fell in the aircraft segment as 
development work on the b2 wound down and fewer main body 
assemblies were delivered for the fa18 fighter 
sales also fell in the electronics segment where deliveries of 
guidance systems for the mx missile fell and in the missiles and 
unmanned vehicles segment the latter decline stemmed from an 
accounting change for work on a classified contract causing a 120 
million reduction in quarterly sales 
for the full year the effect of the fourthquarter charges was 
partially offset by higher revenues from startup of b2 production 
and increased delivery of parts for the boeing 747 jetliner 
northrop said its business backlog stood at 56 billion at the 
end of 1989 compared with 49 billion at the end of 1988 kent 
kresa the company chairman has predicted 1990 sales will stay at 
about the same level as in 1989

state environmental officials complained 
wednesday that senate and white house negotiations are weakening a 
proposed clean air bill so much that many urban areas would not be 
able to meet the air quality standards 
the officials from 13 states many of which are plagued with 
some of the worst urban smog problems in the country criticized 
the closeddoor dealmaking and urged senate leaders to bring the 
measure to the senate floor where it can be openly debated 
among the state officials who accused the senate and 
administration negotiators of weakening the senate bill were those 
responsible for air pollution controls in southern california and 
the new york city area two regions facing the most serious smog 
problems 
under the compromises already tentatively agreed to in the 
private senate negotiations we would not be able to obtain 
healthy air in southern california said norton younglove 
chairman of the south coast air quality management district in 
california 
thomas joring new york state commissioner of environmental 
conservation said some of the provisions worked out in the private 
talks would make the new air pollution control law weaker than 
current law especially as it applies to curbing urban smog 
the criticism came as senate leaders and the bush adminstration 
continued the closeddoor discussions for a third week in hopes of 
crafting a bill that would have enough support to avoid a 
contentuous debate and possible filibuster on the senate floor 
senate majority leader george mitchell said he hoped to conclude 
by the end of the week the private discussions on the bill which 
would revise federal air pollution controls for the first time in 
13 years 
mitchell said he expects plenty of debate on the senate 
floor once the private discussions are completed 
while the talks have reached tentative agreements on some parts 
of the bill such as curbs on acid rain major differences remained 
over how to reduce pollution for automobiles 
the senate bill calls for a second round of tailpipe controls 
while the administration says thats too expensive and favors using 
cleaner motor fuels in the most polluted areas of the country such 
as los angeles and the northeast 
but the state pollution control officials focused their 
criticism on areas where the negotiators already have reached 
agreement 
among the areas of concern were compromises that would no 
longer require the federal government to impose a smog cleanup plan 
if local officials are unwilling or unable to do so that would 
exempt small industrial polluters from urban smog controls reduce 
the geographic areas that would be covered under urban air cleanup 
programs 
the pollution cleanup program envisioned by this senatebush 
administration deal will not work in practice the state 
officials said in a statement 
the group included air pollution control officials from the 
states of california oregon washington nevada colorado 
delaware new jersey new york rhode island massachusetts new 
hampshire vermont and maine 
meanwhile a group of environmental organizations blamed white 
house chief of staff john sununu for the administrations stand on 
the clean air bill claiming that sununu was undercutting the 
presidents environmental policies 
the groups including the national wildlife federation national 
audubon society and the natural resources defense council asked to 
meet with bush to discuss their environmental concerns including 
those involving the clean air bill negotiations 
marlin fitzwater the presidents spokesman said sununu 
ensures that all points of view are heard and that is a role that 
he has played with regard to environmental policies 
and the president has made the decisions on environmental 
policies they represent his point of view and his priorities 
fitzwater continued and environmnental groups by the same 
token represent interest groups and pressure groups and it is 
their job to keep the pressure on theyre doing it the governors 
doing his job i dont see any real difficulty here

the specter of rising worldwide interest rates rattled major 
global stock markets wednesday sending prices down in new york and 
london after they skidded lower in the tokyo markets thirdworst 
drop ever 
on wall street stocks declined sharply at the opening in 
response to the wave of selling overseas and the release in 
washington of a report showing high january inflation that could 
push interest rates even higher 
the dow jones industrial average dropped more than 40 points in 
the early going before regaining some ground the widely watched 
index closed down 1329 at 258356 giving it a twoday loss of 52 
points 
broader market indicators also dropped with declining issues 
outnumbering gainers by a margin of about 5 to 3 on the new york 
stock exchange and the wilshire associates index of more than 5000 
stocks losing 74 billion in value 
stock prices fell on wall street after the labor department 
reported food and energy price hikes helped push its consumer price 
index for january up 11 percent the biggest jump in 7 years 
the report prompted renewed speculation that the federal reserve 
which has kept interest rates relatively high in an attempt to 
curb inflation would not move rates lower anytime soon 
similar worries sparked the wednesday selloff in tokyo where 
the nikkei stock average the japanese markets major index fell 
more than 3 percent that was the markets third biggest dive ever 
and worst since the worldwide stock market crash in october 1987 
the nikkei average reflecting the performance of 225 selected 
issues fell 116119 points or 315 percent to 3573433 after 
having fallen nearly 565 points in the previous two trading days 
the retreat continued thursday as the nikkei average fell 
another 40597 points or 113 percent to 3532836 in morning 
trading 
analysts attributed the tokyo markets weakness to increasing 
speculation that the bank of japan would raise its official 
discount rate the interest it charges for loans to commercial 
banks 
later in london stock prices fell as traders watched interest 
rates rise on the british bond markets and reacted to the overnight 
selloff in tokyo and early weakness on wall street 
the financial timesstock exchange index of 100 issues down 31 
points early in the session closed down 173 points or 08 
percent at 22597 
inflation has spooked the financial markets since the start of 
the year wall street began 1990 with the dow jones industrial 
average hitting a new high in the first session of the year but 
the market since has been stymied by the prospect of higher 
interest rates which can depress corporate profits 
wall street analysts said the dow industrials partial recovery 
from wednesdays early lows represented bargainhunting more than 
an endorsement of the equity market 
you have institutions waiting for the opportunity to buy 
said peter vandenberg a market analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
the stock market also was aided by firmer prices and lower 
yields on the treasury bond market late wednesday the 
governments bellwether 30year bond was up 250 per 1000 in 
face value while its yield which moves in the opposite direction 
from its price edged down to 864 percent from 866 percent late 
tuesday 
bonds had also fallen on the cpi report compounding sharp 
losses in the credit markets on tuesday but analysts said 
wednedays declines were more than offset by bargain hunting and by 
the decline on wall street which prompted some investors to switch 
funds out of stocks and into bonds 
similarly such blue chips as international business machines 
corp which are seen as better longterm bets did relatively 
better ibm was up 2 to 10487 a share wednesday outdistancing 
the rest of the market 
ralph acampora a stock market analyst with kidder peabody amp 
co said the stock market has been in a twotier system since 
august with stocks in the dow industrial average outperforming the 
rest of the market 
its not horrendous for the blue chips its horrendous for 
everything else acampora said

oregons largest thrift institution benj 
franklin federal savings and loan association was seized wednesday 
by regulators who said it failed to meet the stringent financial 
standards of the new savings and loan law 
the resolution trust corp created last august to dispose of 
failed sampls took control of the portland institution which has 
about 5 billion in assets after the office of thrift supervision 
said franklin was operating in an unsafe and unsound condition 
franklin largely because of the new capital standards 106 
million in the red at the end of november according to ed 
headlund deputy district director of the thrift offices seattle 
office 
that was after an accounting break of about 280 million known 
as supervisory goodwill was removed from its books it had booked 
most of the goodwill as a result of its 1982 acquisition of 
equitable savings and loan which it took over at regulators 
request 
goodwill is usually the difference between the purchase price of 
an asset and its real value 
the sampl bill last august revoked the accounting break for 
franklin and scores of other sampls the law now requires 
institutions to hold tangible capital of 150 for every 100 of 
assets and does not permit them to count good will in the 150 
also franklin suffered from problems in the oregon real estate 
market that surfaced several years earlier according to headlund 
in an attempt to pull out of its problems franklin in october 
announced a costcutting program that included layoffs and the sale 
of its commercial lending operation 
kevin shields a portlandbased spokesman for the resolution 
trust corp said the corporation will try to sell franklin to or 
merge it with another savings and loan 
but that wont happen quickly he said estimating it would 
take six months before buyers might be sought 
franklin chief executive officer g dale weight will be on paid 
leave he said 
unlike many failed sampls it did not invest heavily in commercial 
real estate or in securities such as junk bonds about 80 percent 
of its holdings were residential mortgages 
franklin is the largest of oregons 12 thrifts at the end of 
september it was the 41st largest sampl in the nation according 
sheshunoff information services inc an austin texas consulting 
firm in addition to oregon it operated branches in idaho and 
washington state 
regulators said franklin would maintain normal business hours 
and stressed that all deposits up to the 100000 insurance limit 
are guaranteed it had 32 billion in deposits in 448612 accounts 
its takeover brings the number of sampls under government 
management to 320
