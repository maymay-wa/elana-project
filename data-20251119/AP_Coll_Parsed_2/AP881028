tonight is the night for most americans to set 
their clocks back an hour as the nation returns to standard time

lawn darts blamed for at least three deaths 
and several thousand injuries in recent years probably will be off 
the market by christmas 
the consumer product safety commission voted friday to ban the 
game and commission officials said the restriction could be in 
force as early as middecember 
the commission also approved safety standards for allterrain 
vehicles which extend the prohibition on sales of threewheel 
versions of those machines 
the ban on lawn darts does not include a recall of the games 
already in peoples homes that prompted commissioner carol dawson 
to issue a plea to parents to keep the darts out of the hands of 
children 
it was the father of a 7yearold girl killed by one of the 
darts two years ago who led the crusade for the ban 
david snow of riverside calif has testified before the 
commission and congress and worked steadily since that tragedy to 
draw attention to the dangers of the large metal or plastic darts 
used in an outdoor game similar to horseshoes 
the commission today finally did what we should have done a 
long time ago said commssioner anne graham what limited 
recreational value lawn darts may have is far outweighed by the 
number of serious injuries and unnecessary deaths 
the action came as an 11yearold tennesee girl lay in a coma 
after a lawn dart penetrated her brain amy herrin was reported in 
critical condition at vanderbilt university medical center in 
nashville 
over the last decade as many as 6700 injuries have been reported 
involving the darts including 150 to 200 cases in which the dart 
penetrated someones skull the commission was told at least three 
deaths have occurred the agency said 
fridays vote directed the agency staff to prepare an official 
notice of the ban by nov 4 if the commissioners then approve the 
legal language the ban would be published in the federal register 
taking legal effect 30 days afterwards 
the vote came one year and one week after the agency began 
looking into the problem chairman terrence m scanlon called this 
extraordinary speed for the the agency which took nearly five years 
to issue its last product ban a 1981 prohibition on the sale of 
urea formaldehyde foam insulation 
last may the agency gave initial approval to banning lawn darts 
capable of penetrating the skull and on july 29 published that 
proposal for public comment 
when it came time for final action on friday however the agency 
expanded the scope of the ban to include all lawn darts capable of 
causing any type of puncture wound not just those heavy enough to 
penetrate the skull 
the more extensive ban had been sought by congress where sen 
albert gore dtenn and rep james j florio dnj have pushed 
the issue 
for several years federal regulations have been in place 
restricting sales of lawn darts to sporting goods stores and sports 
sections of department stores in an effort to keep them away from 
children 
in many cases however they are sold in combination with other 
games such as volleyball and badminton and thus can easily come 
into use by children 
scanlon and graham voted for the ban with dawson abstaining until 
she sees the legal notice 
earlier scanlon and dawson joined in a 21 vote to approve 
safety standards for allterrain vehicles which effectively 
prohibit sales of threewheel versions of the machines 
last january the manufacturers of the machines agreed to stop 
selling the threewheel atvs in a consent agreement that won 
approval from a federal judge in the spring 
that settlement called for the commission and manufacturers to 
work out safety standards for the offroad singlerider machines 
which have been blamed for nearly 1000 deaths and hundreds of 
thousands of injuries in recent years 
the vote extends indefinitely the ban on sales of the 
threewheelers 
in addition the commission directed its staff to continue 
working on other safety aspects of the machines in particular 
standards for stability of the fourwheel versions now being sold 
as well as safety labeling and training programs

economists are disputing the reagan 
administrations contention that the budget deficits underlying 
trend is downward despite a small increase for 1988 
the treasury department and the white house office of management 
and budget reported friday that the imbalance between revenues and 
spending rose to 1551 billion for the budget year that ended sept 
30 a 54 billion increase over 1987 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady in a joint statement with 
the omb pointed out that several onetime events including the 
phasein of the new tax law cut the 1987 deficit and inflated the 
1988 budget gap 
excluding those special factors the deficit would have fallen 
311 billion between 1987 and 1988 he said adding the 
underlying trend in the deficit remains downward 
private economists concede that 1988 represents substantial 
progress compared with the record 2211 billion shortfall of two 
years ago 
however they see little hope for meeting the administration 
projection of 1455 billion for the current 1989 fiscal year 
absent substantial new spending cuts or a tax increase 
the federal government spent a record 1064 trillion during 
fiscal 1988 up 6 percent from 1987 receipts were 909 billion up 
64 percent 
interest payments on the 261 trillion national debt totaled 
2141 billion 96 percent greater than a year earlier 
analysts predict slower economic growth will cut into tax 
receipts in 1989 and they expect the federal reserve board as an 
inflationfighting measure will push interest rates higher pushing 
up government spending to finance the debt 
the economy as measured by the gross national product expanded 
37 percent during the 1988 fiscal year and many analysts are 
expecting the rate to slow to 25 percent during 1989 
its almost impossible to see how we can reduce the deficit if 
we have slower growth said michael k evans a consultant in 
washington and the government is ignoring the fact that 
interest has been going up steadily i realize treasury 
secretaries arent supposed to say these things but thats 
certainly the case 
bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch amp co said that 
if the budget deficits dont go down the government will have 
difficulty whittling away the trade imbalance and interest rates 
likely will stay high to persuade foreigners to buy us debt 
were close to the end of a business expansion thats run a 
very long time the problems and destabilizing effects of running 
this kind of deficit may become more acute steinberg said one 
of the problems the next administration is going to face is that 
there will be a downturn and we will not be able to loosen fiscal 
policy 
during past recessions the government has stepped up deficit 
spending as a means of stimulating the economy 
a bipartisan commission on the deficit has been meeting since 
summer and after the nov 8 election will offer the new president 
its recommendations however economists are concerned that both 
candidates have left themselves little room to maneuver after taking 
office 
republican george bush has promised to reject the recommendation 
if it includes a tax increase and has proposed a tax cut for 
capital gains democrat michael dukakis while promising to consider 
the report so far has proposed no tax increases and few specific 
spending cuts

the reagan administration has rejected a rice 
industry request for a federal investigation of japanese barriers to 
rice imports averting a political storm in japan and threatening 
one in the united states 
the decision announced friday was something of a surprise and was 
the first important test of the new tougher 1988 omnibus trade act 
that was designed to help restore the competitiveness of american 
goods on foreign markets 
disappointed us rice industry officials condemned the decision 
and said in a statement that it hoped the new administration to take 
office in january will be more concerned about promoting us 
interests than pleasing foreign governments 
clayton yeutter the special trade representative said in 
announcing the decision to reject a petition of rice growers and 
millers that japans virtual ban on imported rice was indefensible 
and intolerable he said it would be vigorously challenged but not 
in the bilateral fashion demanded by us rice farmers 
yeutter said the administration believed it would be more 
effective to pursue the complaint through the 97nation general 
agreement on tariffs and trade which currently is holding a 
fullscale set of negotiations on global trade liberalization 
agricultural trade is a central focus of the gatt negotiations 
the gatt participants are scheduled to hold a review session in 
december in montreal to assess progress since the talks began in 
1986 and to consider the way ahead 
yeutter told reporters he expects support from japan at montreal 
on broad us goals for liberalizing agricultural trade including a 
us proposal to eliminate farm subsidies by the year 2000 
if on the other hand representatives of the government of 
japan are not helpful and supportive in the agricultural discussions 
in montreal and if it becomes apparent that they are not committed 
to solving the rice issue i am prepared to reconsider this 
decision yeutter said 
in that event yeutter said he would invite the us rice 
industry to refile its petition and he would make a decision on 
the petition before the conclusion of the reagan administration 
jan 20 
in the background of yeutters decision were warnings from the 
japanese a japanese cabinet official regarded as a spokesman for 
prime minister noboru takeshita on economic issues said here last 
week that turning the rice issue into an unfair trade case could 
trigger political reaction at home violent enough to jeopardize 
promised japanese support of further farm trade liberalization 
michihiko kunihiro deputy foreign minister for economic affairs 
said in washington oct 21 he advised us officials the reaction 
would be very violent to an unfair trade case on rice in a sort 
of prosecution by the united states 
all positive thinking of agricultural people back in japan 
would stop and we will have very great difficulty in pushing 
forward to liberalization in the uruguay round he said 
rural interests have major influence in takeshitas 
liberaldemocratic party which has ruled japan for more than three 
decades in september all parties in the lower house of parliament 
joined to adopt a nonbinding resolution against imports of rice 
which has nearmystical significance for the populace but the 
staple costs the japanese six to 10 times the world price of rice 
because of lessefficient domestic production on small plots in the 
mountainous country 
backers of the sept 14 petition of the us rice millers 
association and the rice council for market development had hoped 
the pressure of presidential politics would force acceptance two of 
the richest states in electoral votes california and texas are 
major rice growers 
both the republican presidential nominee vice president george 
bush and democratic candidate michael dukakis had voiced support 
for the rice industrys position 
reagans administration rejected a similar petition in 1986 
because it wanted to give tokyo time to negotiate changes in its ban 
on rice imports 
we are shocked and dismayed that ambassador yeutter once again 
would reject the us rice industrys request said j stephen 
gabbert president of the rice millers group 
rep vic fazio dcalif whose district includes some of the 
biggest rice farms in the nation said the decision proved reagan 
administration officials are patsies when it comes to doing battle 
against even blatantly illegal trade barriers 
both californias senators democrat alan cranston and republican 
pete wilson expressed dismay this refusal by the us to take 
direct action under our new tougher trade law could well serve to 
reaffirm the practice of protectionism by the japanese and resound 
negatively throughout the us economy said wilson

a senate subcommittee chairman has lambasted a 
pentagon recommendation that a special commission considering which 
us military bases to close not include any of the more than 1500 
overseas installations 
i find it ludicrous and beyond belief that the department of 
defense is trying to tell us not one could be closed said 
sen alan dixon dill chairman of the senate armed services 
readiness subcommittee 
legislation signed by president reagan this week authorized an 
independent citizens commission to decide which of the nations 
domestic and overseas bases are outmoded and could be closed at a 
projected annual savings of 2 billion to 5 billion 
dixon said deputy defense secretary william h taft iv advised 
the armed services committee in a recent letter that a pentagon 
study being sent to the commission recommends that no foreign bases 
be closed 
if us communities are going to be asked to undergo 
significant economic and social upheaval through installation 
closures and realignments i believe they have a right to expect 
that our bases overseas will receive the same scrutiny as those in 
illinois alaska or michigan dixon said 
pentagon spokesman fred hoffman declined comment telling 
reporters we have sent a classified report on the subject to 
congress but as you know i cant discuss classified reports 
dixon also contended the recommendation was the wrong message to 
send us allies he said it would discourage them from shouldering 
a greater portion of the cost for their own defense

the bbcs worldwide radio service recognized by 
millions as the quintessential voice of britain is dropping some of 
its upperclass accents and imperial signature tunes in an overhaul 
of its stately image 
its boss is worried that the beeb is sounding pompous and 
outofdate 
this doesnt mean the bbcs external englishlanguage service 
plan to use announcers with broad northern england accents or 
vowelslewing cockney tones 
and it wont get rid of the chimes of big ben the cricket scores 
and the reassuring hourly announcement this is london 
but nearly six decades after the calm measured voice of the 
british broadcasting corporation began beaming around the globe its 
executives have decided it risks verging on the pompous said 
john tusa managing director of the corporations world service 
people kept saying what a wonderful network as if thats the 
end of the matter tusa said in an interview 
thats exactly the time to examine it root and branch and make 
sure you are improving and keeping ahead you have to change before 
the audience changes 
to some the change is as inevitable as the disappearance of 
britains bus conductors its red pay telephone booths and its 
shillings and pence but some traditionalists are uneasy 
correct pronounciation is one of the things that have made 
british broadcasting the best in the world said jocelyn hay 
chairman of a pressure group called voice of the listener it must 
never degenerate into the slang and slovenly speech found on other 
bbc domestic networks 
the overhaul the most radical in the 57year history of the 
overseas englishlanguage service includes toning down the rousing 
brassband march that for 48 years has introduced a prime news 
program radio newsreel 
instead a synthesiserorchestrated version of imperial 
echoes will be broadcast ahead of the program itself restyled and 
renamed newsreel 
elizabeth smith controller of the englishlanguage service said 
critics including some of the 60 us american public radio 
stations that relay bbc programs found the old version strident 
and inappropriately imperialistic 
we were brought up on this sort of tune said tusa 52 i 
thought it was just simply out of date partly colored by the 
knowledge it was called imperial echoes 
but he has stopped short of tampering with the bbcs famed 
signature tune lilliburlero the marching melody by henry 
purcell that precedes hourly news bulletins 
the service taken as gospel by dozens of heads of state is 
renowned for its impartiality and claims the worlds largest 
foreign audience with 25 million listeners outstripping voice of 
america or radio moscow 
tusa a former bbctv anchorman who took over the world service 
in 1986 is unmoved by the suggestion that hes meddling with an 
institution 
its precisely when i hear the word institution that my hackles 
rise said tusa once youre an institution youre halfway 
downhill 
on accents a topic which obsesses the british even more than the 
weather tusa said theres a difference between sounding 
aggressively and oppressively home counties and just sounding more 
neutral but it will still be pretty southern standard received 
english 
translated that means replacing the clipped slightly nasal 
tones of the welltodo in the five counties ringing london with the 
accent of the educated southern english middleclasses who like to 
think they dont have any accent 
the 24hour englishlanguage service is the bestknown of the 
bbcs statefunded foreign broadcasts in 37 languages to an audience 
of 120 million 
the changes which began gradually a year ago are part of what 
tusa says is becoming less solemn and sounding more like todays 
britain for an audience that is mainly under 30 male nearly 
twothirds in the third world and often speaking english as a second 
language 
other new programs are newshour a new nightly current 
affairs program starting monday financial news bulletins up to 10 
times a day and megamix a program for young people that will 
feature among other things heavy metal rock music 
its really communicating with young people said tusa 
they are setting the tone

secrecy is a part of life in 
south africa extending far beyond national security to corporate 
boardrooms athletic fields even cooking contests and a zoo 
directors office 
because of the stigma attached abroad to dealings with south 
africa leaders in government business entertainment and sports 
consider clandestine tactics necessary 
an editorial in business day a johannesburg newspaper said the 
national party government engages in a systematic concealment of 
the truth from the public the idea of simple public accountability 
has decayed so far that not only invasions but even the salaries of 
public servants are concealed 
base salaries of officials are disclosed but extensive allowances 
for homes travel cars and other expenses are not 
peter soal a member of parliament for the antiapartheid 
progressive federal party declared it impossible for the average 
citizen to keep abreast of whats going on 
this penchant for secrets reaches high levels foreign minister 
roelof f botha peeled off for two days during a visit to europe 
with president pw botha who is not related 
i am not prepared to say publicly exactly where i was except 
to say i visited one or two countries in the east or in africa he 
said after rejoining the presidential party 
the government controlled by the white minority claims several 
statesmen from black africa have paid clandestine visits to south 
africa in recent years 
officials also say prominent blacks in south africa have 
negotiated secretly with the government about possible political 
reforms but that identifying them might discredit those leaders in 
the eyes of other blacks 
much of the nations foreign trade is enveloped in secrecy 
particularly when it involves efforts to circumvent economic 
sanctions the government says south africa trades with 40 of the 50 
other african countries but refuses to name them 
statistics on arms imports and exports are secret as is most 
information about energy and the nuclear program 
south africa does not say how much oil it consumes or where it 
comes from disclosing information on how petroleum is obtained has 
been made a crime to protect those supplying oil in violation of a 
un embargo 
the defense act prohibits unauthorized reports about the 
composition and activities of the armed forces statistics on draft 
resistance are not revealed and past incursions into angola have 
been kept secret 
south africa did not confirm its renewed presence in angola last 
year until many weeks after large numbers of troops crossed the 
border military headquarters did not issue comprehensive statistics 
on casualties among its black troops involved in the campaign 
members of parliament have the right to ask cabinet ministers for 
information and statistics that might not be disclosed otherwise 
but ministers often refuse to respond on grounds disclosure would 
not be in the national interest 
that answer has become more prevalent lately soal said in an 
interview the nationalists have a passion for secrecy 
emergency regulations forbid unauthorized reports about detainees 
or action by security forces justice minister kobie coetzee 
recently proposed restricting news reports of trials 
because of the extensive international sports boycott foreign 
athletes sometimes arrive using pseudonyms occasionally with the 
cooperation of south african media teams compete without their 
nationality or the names of the players being disclosed 
on many occasions the locations of sports events are not 
announced until foreign competitors are en route to south africa and 
thus less susceptible to lastminute political pressure 
even nonsports competitions can assume a cloakanddagger 
aspect the departure of four young south african chefs for an 
international cooking contest this month was kept secret until the 
eve of their departure 
a white tiger arrived at the pretoria zoo in early october in a 
trade with an american zoo which received a king cheetah zoo 
director willie labuschagne said the zoo in the united states asked 
not to be identified 
foreign film crews produce movies here secretly they like the 
relatively low production costs but want to avoid international 
publicity about the choice of locale 
the star the largestselling daily newspaper recently 
editorialized on the extent of secrecy and concluded it will be 
nice one day to shout from the rooftops again

the ballot is so bewildering in 
california this year that some officials have borrowed an idea from 
the supermarket for the nov 8 election express lanes for those 
who know how they are going to vote 
even by california standards this years ballot is crowded 
complex and confusing 
there are 29 statewide propositions and some communities have 
added dozens of measures and campaigns and of course voters also 
must contend with the presidential election a senatorial contest 
and congressional races 
in san francisco which this year has the longest ballot in 
california and possibly the nation the registrar of voters threw up 
her hands and quit three weeks before election day warning of 
electoral gridlock at the polls 
in sacramento 41yearold computer technician jim stoeckel says 
he feels guilty that hes shirking his duties as a voter because 
hes spent only two hours so far skimming his 160page 
california voters ballot pamphlet 
but stoeckel is lucky hes a voter in sacramento where there are 
only eight local propositions on the ballot in addition to the 
nearrecord statewide propositions 
if he lived in san francisco hed have a second 192page 
official voters pamphlet with arguments and analyses on 24 local 
propositions plus a regional advisory proposition on bridge tolls 
to consider a total of 54 ballot propositions 
san franciscos long ballot prompted election officials to 
introduce for the first time an express booth at each polling 
place for voters who have premarked their sample ballots some 
small counties also are using the express booth 
statewide authorities have also dusted off just in case its 
needed a neverenforced 78yearold state law that limits each 
voter to 10 minutes in the booth 
but officials dont want to try to enforce that because they 
dont believe that even those who know how they intend to vote on 
every item can vote that quickly this year 
it will still take you 10 to 15 minutes just to punch the 
holes said germaine wong acting registrar of voters in san 
francisco 
the statewide initiatives confronting californias 135 million 
voters include five conflicting plans to curb skyrocketing auto 
insurance rates two aids measures a proposal to raise cigarette 
taxes 25 cents per pack and a measure that in effect would override 
the governors veto of a worker safety program 
at the local level there are hundreds more ballot propositions 
covering subjects as diverse as growth control selections of new 
dump sites rent controls and proposed new library law enforcement 
and transit taxes 
wong said her citys ballot is so long that for the first time 
ever it requires two computer punch cards and its complicated 
because you vote differently on the two cards 
she said one of the cards has the names of candidates with 
instructions to punch holes next to your choices while the other 
card just has numbered holes keyed to a separate voter pamphlet 
san francisco voters have seen both kinds of cards before but 
never in the same election she said 
asked why the two cards were different wong replied that she 
didnt know because she had just been on the job a week replacing 
michelle corwin who without warning submitted a letter of 
resignation oct 17 
her letter indicated that since she was planning to leave in 
january and because there was a lot of unpleasant work to be done 
between now and then she would just leave now and save herself the 
trouble said the citys astonished chief administrative officer 
rudy nothenberg 
wong said her office has received 65000 applications for 
absentee ballots more than double the normal number among the 
citys 436000 registered voters while registrars in other counties 
reported requests for absentee ballots up by 10 percent to 75 
percent 
in nearby alameda county there are 27 local propositions among 
its communities but some apply to one town and not to another san 
diego county has 37 but again unlike san francisco where the 
county and city lines coincide not all the propositions are on all 
the ballots 
the statewide propositions have numbers and the local ones have 
letters and ingred gonzalez a san diego county elections officer 
said this election is the first time she ever ran out of letters for 
propositions 
we went through the alphabet once and a second time with double 
letters through up to proposition nn she said

a watchdog group says that 59 house members 
seeking reelection without majorparty rivals have raised 148 
million anyway but lawmakers and campaign aides say they cant be 
blamed for opponents who never materialized 
youre never sure youre going to be unopposed said george 
dalley counsel to rep charles rangel dny who was among the 
most successful fundraisers despite having no serious opposition 
for more than a decade we dont take anything for granted we 
just keep running 
rangel is also among 28 of the 59 unopposed lawmakers who by 
law can keep unused campaign funds whenever they retire from 
congress a 1974 law that barred lawmakers from keeping unspent 
campaign money for personal use after leaving capitol hill exempted 
house members elected before 1980 rangel was elected in 1970 
many of the unchallenged incumbents on the list compiled by the 
private group congress watch are house leadership figures such as 
speaker jim wright dtexas and reps claude pepper dfla 
chairman of the rules committee john dingell dmich chairman of 
the energy and commerce committee and kika de la garza dtexas 
chairman of the agriculture committee 
fortythree of the 59 unopposed lawmakers are democrats who 
control the house the 148 million includes 74 million from 
political action committees and a like amount from individuals 
that these pacs feel compelled to contribute to lawmakers who 
have no opponent shows that whats being sought is access and 
influence not compatible candidates or good government said joan 
claybrook president of public citizen the parent organization of 
congress watch 
pacs are formed by corporations labor unions and other interest 
groups to funnel money to candidates with incumbents the 
longfavored recipients for the 1986 elections according to 
federal election commission records pacs sent 88 percent of their 
contributions to lawmakers seeking reelection 
congress watch found that from jan 1 1987 through sept 30 
1988 31 of the 59 incumbents with no primary or major party general 
election opponents raised more than 100000 from pacs of these 12 
raked in more than 200000 and three pocketed more than 300000 
during the same period 20 unopposed incumbents raised more than 
300000 from pacs and individuals combined of these 10 collected 
more than 400000 and three received more than 500000 the 
figures were compiled from federal election commission data 
rep martin frost dtexas whose 524000 in pac and individual 
contributions was tops on the list said he had raised most of his 
money last year before he knew he would be unopposed

the owner of an akron daycare center and her 
two sons were charged thursday with a total of 11 felonies stemming 
from allegations of ritualistic and sexual abuse of children in 
their care authorities said 
the charges were filed against owner hazel riggs and sons phillip 
d schmidt 24 and michael a schmidt about 22 following an 
investigation by the state attorney generals office said deputy 
attorney general greg smith 
riggs and phillip schmidt were taken into custody in akron 
thursday and bond was set for riggs at 10000 and for phillip 
schmidt at 50000 said washington county sheriff steve vosburg 
riggs met bond but phillip schmidt was being held and michael 
schmidt apparently was out of state and being sought the sheriff 
said 
the 11 counts alleged sexual assaults on four different children 
by phillip schmidt and michael schmidt and two counts against riggs 
of being an accessory smith said 
the state investigation was conducted at gov roy romers request 
after district attorney doyle johns in washington county closed the 
case in july without filing charges 
the case began when seven children under riggs care alleged they 
were raped and sodomized by groups of adults authorities said 
the children who all had been in therapy told investigators 
they were sexually abused by masked adults during what some 
childcare officials believed may have been satanic rituals the 
denver post reported in may 
one 4yearold boy at that time described a ceremonial 
decapitation of a young boy he called bobby the newspaper said 
two other children also described a playmate named bobby but 
johns said those allegations were refuted because no body ever was 
found and no bobby ever was identified 
johns yearlong investigation ended july 26 when he ruled there 
was no evidence to support the childrens accounts the center was 
closed when riggs relinquished her license last year 
parents and victims advocates said no credible investigation was 
done with some parents never being contacted and the home not being 
searched for 10 months after the allegations 
public reaction prompted romer to order attorney general duane 
woodard to investigate smith said thursday he couldnt comment on 
that aspect of the case except to say there was substantial 
additional evidence uncovered during the state investigation

george bush accused michael dukakis on 
thursday of trying to scare the american people by putting 
japanese flags in his television commercials and said the right 
way to gain world markets for us exports is by opening them not 
shrinking from competition 
in a white circussized tent at applied materials co in 
californias silicon valley the republican presidential nominee 
said he would promote us trade but not with protectionist 
measures 
it doesnt make sense to stick our heads in the sand as some 
in the other party have suggested and try to build walls around 
america the vice president said it doesnt make sense to 
launch a trade war and plunge america and the world into a recession 
and it is beneath the dignity of the presidency and of the 
voters to try to incite fear of foreigners as a cheap means of 
winning a few votes bush said 
at the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles bush and his wife 
barbara toured a holocaust museum and the vice president told a 
courtyard audience we owe the dead and survivors alike a promise 
of vigilance 
the bush campaign earlier dismissed seven members of an ethnic 
advisory panel who had been accused of nazi sympathies 
we have no room in our communities for hidden nazi fugitives or 
war criminals bush said at the center every last one of them 
must be found and brought to justice 
bigotry is not welcome as president i will raise my voice and 
the full force of federal law when it is violated against every hate 
group desecrater and demagogue brownshirt whiteshirt or bowtie 
skokie brooklyn chicago wherever it is the villain is the same 
at a reception at the estate of comedian bob hope outside los 
angeles bush promised a kinder gentler finish for this 
campaign after all the criticism of negative votehunting but he 
followed that immediately with a repeat of his attack on dukakis for 
the massachusetts prison furlough program saying it amounts to 
telling criminals to have a nice vacation 
the 5000acouple reception outside hopes mansion drew 
hollywood names ranging from jane russell to esther williams to 
phyllis diller 
campaigning must be rough flying to all those different 
cities hope told his guests who included barbara bush these 
two people have seen almost as many hotel rooms as jimmy swaggart 
welcome orel bush proclaimed a banner atop the podium it 
was a humorous reference to orel hershiser the los angeles dodgers 
pitcher who was named most valuable player in the world series 
as he campaigned in the west bush repeatedly vowed opposition to 
federal gun controls drawing cheers each time his campaign issued 
copies of a 1976 statement in which dukakis called for tight handgun 
restrictions 
dukakis campaigning wednesday in colorado had said his position 
was being misrepresented and that he always had supported the 
right of hunters and sportsmen and of people to protect themselves 
in their own homes 
bush said foreign investment in the united states is not the 
threat the democrats claim 
he also said that dukakis should explain why his thinly veiled 
comments about foreign investment only mention japanwhich he said 
ranks only third as a source of foreign investment in the united 
states 
my opponent knows better and he should stop trying to scare 
the american people by putting japanese flags on these american 
television commercials of his bush said 
the footage of the japanese flag appears in a dukakis ad 
challenging bushs record as head of a commission that examined 
usjapanese trade relations the ad is running in ohio 
bush returned from japan saying our trade relationship was 
superb the ad says superb for japan maybe superb for 
japanese workers but bad news for american working families mike 
dukakis stands up to foreign competition 
bush said the nations of the pacific represent huge and growing 
markets for american products if we dont turn and run away 
i will make sure that our trading partners continue to 
understand that our markets are vital to their growth as well 
bush said free trade must be fair trade a bush administration 
will keep the heat on 
in tacoma wash bush accepted the endorsement of the national 
marine engineers beneficial association a seamens union with 
50000 members it will send a signal nationwide the vice 
president said as he received an oversized union card as an honorary 
member 
a handful of hecklers infiltrated the endorsement rally in a 
tacoma hotel exhibition hall and at least four of them were hustled 
out by police one man had a bloody nose another was in handcuffs 
the bush campaign said its policy was not to oust demonstrators 
tacoma police said two were arrested for trespassing one of them 
also charged with resisting arrest 
the ousters caused more of a stir than the heckling had bush as 
usual aimed a speech line at the dissenters none of em leaned 
over and said please raise my taxes he said dukakis likely 
would raise taxes if elected

the agriculture departments inability to 
account for up to 16 billion of commodity certificates is a huge 
unknown that could seriously affect grain markets a house 
subcommittee chairman says 
these certificates are just like stocks that represent millions 
of dollars of us grain reserves we cant just gloss over this 
problem rep dan glickman dkan said thursday 
the certificates which have a specific dollar value can be 
redeemed for cash used to buy governmentowned commodities repay 
government crop price support loans or resold to other individuals 
glickmans remarks came in response to a general accounting 
office report that said usda has not resolved recordkeeping 
discrepancies potentially worth 16 billion for thousands of 
commodity certificates issued as partial government subsidy payments 
to farmers 
the report said there are growing numbers of unreconciled 
discrepancies in some instances there are no records of issuance 
for certificates that have been reported as redeemed in others 
redeemed certificates are recorded with a higher or lower value than 
as issued 
the agency recommended that usda develop an immediate plan for 
eliminating the problem 
glickman who requested the gao report as chairman of the 
agriculture subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains said 
the existence of the discrepancies has potentially large 
implications for the markets particularly in an environment of 
increasing tightness and increased volatility 
that the governments commodity operation cannot account 
accurately for such a large claim on its assets which represent 
potential grain supplies to the market represents a disturbingly 
huge unknown glickman said in a letter to agriculture secretary 
richard e lyng 
between 1986 and april 1988 usda issued more than 16 million 
certificates valued at 187 billion to farmers about 3 million 
remain outstanding worth about 3 billion the gao said 
the agricultural stabilization and conservation service which 
administers farm subsidy programs has assigned a team to correct 
certificates with discrepancies and has approved a plan for reducing 
the backlog but gao said the actions would not resolve the problem 
and a backlog of 116000 certificates would remain

a reverse mortgage plan designed to help the 
nations house rich and cash poor would provide elderly 
homeowners with up to hundreds of dollars monthly for the rest of 
their lives and no need to pay it back unless they sell 
the home equity conversion mortgage insurance program announced 
thursday by the department of housing and urban development 
initially will insure 2500 nopayment loans to older americans who 
own homes but need cash to keep them up or lead decent lives 
under the demonstration program ordered in a 1987 law the lender 
takes an interest in the elderly borrowers property in exchange for 
supplementing his or her income the limited number of reverse 
mortgages are to be available through banks and other lenders by 
next april hud officials said 
the mortgage principal interest and insurance fees will be 
collected when the house is sold or when a borrower dies just as a 
conventional mortgage would have to be settled before heirs could 
take possession of a property 
it will be possible for the elderly to take out a reverse 
mortgage without putting out a penny said judith v may hud 
policy analyst who helped design the program and described it at a 
briefing 
the loans differ from regular home equity loans in that the money 
does not have to be paid back during the lifetime of the borrower 
interest rates would be lower and there is no way for the borrower 
to default on the loan or lose the house 
there is a possibility that the homeowner may accumulate debts 
that exceed the value of the house if he or she lives long enough 
but a builtin insurance program would ensure that neither the 
borrower nor heirs to the estate would have to repay the overrun 
to qualify a homeowner must be at least 62 own his or her home 
outright or with a minimal mortgage and submit to counseling by hud 
housing experts 
heirs to the property would generally be included in the 
counseling said ms may so they would understand the effect the 
program would have on the value of the property 
ms may said an elderly borrower would have the option of 
receiving monthly payments for life or larger payments for a set 
term or a line of credit to be drawn upon when needed 
the older the borrower and the more valuable the house the 
bigger the payments could be 
maximum loans would range from 67500 to 101250 depending on 
federal housing administration maximum insurance for different parts 
of the country 
monthly benefits on a 10 percent mortgage would range from 81 
for a 62yearold borrower in a house valued at 50000 to 662 for 
an 85yearold in a house valued at 100000 or more 
a person who takes out a maximum loan on a 100000 house at age 
75 and lives to be 100 could accumulate a debt of 538861 but would 
still own the house until he or she died and there could be no lien 
against any other property even though the debt may exceed the value 
of the house 
along with the payments small mortgage insurance premiums would 
be deducted from the homes value so that the program could cover 
any losses 
officials said the 2500 loans would be available in every region 
of the country in proportion to the number of elderly homeowners in 
each area 
this is another option to help older people survive and thrive 
in our country said carol fraser fisk national commissioner on 
aging 
representatives of the federal national mortgage association 
known as fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corp known 
as freddie mac announced they would purchase loans under the plan 
hud says 73 percent of americas 189 million elderly own their 
own homes and 83 percent of those or 115 million owe nothing on 
them 
that creates a potential reverse mortgage market of 700 billion 
said william a schainker fannie mae senior vice president 
the reverse mortgages will be available from regular lending 
institutions but will be insured by hud so there will be no risk of 
payments being cut off or of loss to the lender said kenneth j 
beirne assistant housing secretary 
too many americans who work most of their lives to pay off 
their mortgages wake up one morning to find that they are house rich 
and cash poor said rep george c wortley rny who worked on 
the legislation setting up the program 
the project will effectively double the number of reverse 
mortgages available in the united states about 2000 have been 
issued by private lenders in seven states 
some adjustments could be made before final rules are adopted 
following a 60day period for public comment officials said

despite warnings five years ago the pentagon 
has continued overpaying its contractors millions of dollars a year 
because purchasing agents havent applied official costcontrol 
rules an audit shows 
most of that money was recovered when contracts were completed 
the internal audit report says but at the very least the defense 
department still loses interest payments on the money and places an 
additional financial burden on itself through premature payouts the 
pentagon auditors concluded 
during calendar years 1986 and 1987 administrative contracting 
officers did not identify and collect overpayments in a timely 
manner and did not assess and collect any accrued interest on these 
overpayments the audit says 
at a minimum the pentagon overpaid contractors by some 64 
million in 1986 and 1987 and then failed to recover the money on a 
timely basis along with some 13 million in interest the auditors 
found 
but if those results from scrutinizing 41 contracts are applied 
statistically to all similar contracts they said the pentagon 
might have distributed close to 1 billion in overpayments in 1986 
and 1987 
during calendar years 1986 and 1987 we projected that dod 
administrative contracting officers did not collect 940 million of 
government overpayments in a timely manner and did not collect 
accrued interest of 186 million on these untimely collected 
overpayments the audit says 
the audit was completed last march but not released by the 
pentagon until this week the army navy and air force departments 
accepted the findings and gave written promises of improvement 
the study was launched as a followup to a 1982 audit that first 
detected the problem the armed services had promised then to take 
appropriate action to address the recommendations 
the latest investigation however found that little appeared to 
have changed in the intervening five years 
at issue is the handling of fixedprice incentivefee 
contracts and the socalled quarterly limitation on payments 
statement required by such contracts 
under a fixedprice incentive contract a weapons builder 
negotiates with the defense department a target cost target profit 
and target price before beginning work once deliveries begin the 
contractor must submit a statement every three months disclosing 
actual cost and profit margins and billings to the pentagon 
if the statement shows that payments have exceeded the target 
cost and profit totals the contractor must refund the overpayment 
if the refund isnt made within 30 days the contractor owes 
interest on the overpayment 
while overpayments can be accounted for and reconciled when the 
contract is closed out the government loses the time value of money 
unless overpayments are detected promptly and collected in a timely 
manner the auditors noted 
using a sample of 41 contracts worth a combined 2 billion the 
inspector general discovered first that pentagon procurement agents 
were not enforcing the requirement that a quarterly statement be 
submitted 
for example of the 230 quarterly statements required in the 
sample 147 were either not submitted or submitted in an untimely 
manner and 27 were improperly prepared the audit found 
some administrative contracting officers did not request 
contractors to submit quarterly statements timely and accurately 
and other administrative contracting officers did not request 
accrued interest on untimely collected overpayments it said 
as a result about 64 million in overpayments was not 
collected in a timely manner in the sample and contractors owed 
the government approximately 13 million in accrued interest on 
these overpayments

the serenity now shrouding eastwest relations 
makes it difficult to recall just how wretched things were in the 
awful autumn of 1983 just five years ago 
the same west german chancellor helmut kohl who jetted off to 
moscow this week for a friendly chat with mikhail s gorbachev was 
busy on a less fraternal undertaking five falls ago the 
installation of us nuclear weapons pointed at soviet targets 
western europe was awash in protest over the missile deployments 
in five countries and the governments which backed the move were on 
the defensive 
to counter the deployments the soviets at one point threatened 
to install their own nuclear missiles in the caribbean aiming them 
at american targets 
it was a time when the high hopes engendered by two sets of 
nuclear arms reduction talks between the superpowers were shattered 
by soviet walkouts from both 
south korea was rocked by twin tragedies which occurred less than 
seven weeks apart the shooting down of kal flight 007 by a soviet 
missile and a north koreaninspired terrorist bombing in burma that 
killed much of the seoul governments top leadership 
with the downing of the kal flight sovietamerican relations 
dropped to a low point at a september meeting with then foreign 
minister andrei gromyko secretary of state george p shultz refused 
to discuss anything else 
it seemed the relationship had hit bottom but with the soviet 
suspension of both arms reduction talks a few weeks later new 
depths were reached 
it was a time when the prosoviet government on grenada was 
ousted by a usled invasion force the first time any marxist 
government had ever been dislodged 
it was a bad fall but the preceding period had set the tone it 
was a vintage year for cold warriors the year when president reagan 
called the soviet union an evil empire and then barely two 
weeks later unveiled the program which to this day remains a core 
issue in sovietamerican relations the strategic defense 
initiative star wars 
it was a time when the prophets of doom were in vogue but the 
reality nowadays is altogether different since 1985 there have 
been four sovietamerican summits and even more significant there 
is less talk of nuclear war than at any time since 1945 
the relaxation in sovietamerican tensions is such that some 
analysts wonder why in the current presidential campaign there are 
so few ideas being aired about what the new mood means and what new 
policies would be appropriate to deal with it 
says graham fuller a former senior official at the central 
intelligence agency when you have hostile soviet union it is 
clear what is the basis of us alliance but what if the threat 
isnt present any longer whats the premise of us alliances and 
whats the role of us power 
fuller contends that the changes in soviet foreign policy are 
such that the next president should begin to ask whats the problem 
between us 
less sanguine about the more upbeat tone in sovietamerican 
relations is former secretary of state henry a kissinger who said 
wednesday that it would be a mistake for the united states to base 
its foreign policy on the good will of a single individual namely 
gorbachev 
look at history kissinger warned at the end of every preceding 
century russian borders have expanded in every direction beyond 
that he said every soviet communist party secretary general has 
repudiated his predecessor meaning that gorbachev may be only a 
transient phenomenon 
a former kissinger deputy at the state department lawrence 
eagleburger believes that the changes in eastwest relations since 
the nightmare year of 1983 signal a turning point that requires 
wisdom and foresight neither of which he says are in abundant 
supply in the current campaign 
what worries me is that nobody is talking about these issues 
eagleburger says unless we recognize the transition thats taking 
place and reorganize the west to deal with it the problems of the 
next 20 years will eat us alive

nicaraguan rebels are struggling in their quest 
to force democratic reforms upon the central american nation because 
of erratic support from the united states president reagans 
national security adviser says 
as a result says army lt gen colin d powell we face the 
grim prospect of further deterioration and continuing crisis in that 
country 
in a speech to the national press club thursday powell said the 
move toward peaceful settlements of conflicts elsewhere around the 
world including afghanistan angola and cambodia is a reflection 
of effective resistance to aggression 
one lesson here is that sometimes leaders have the wit to see 
the futility of war and to seek diplomatic solutions he said a 
socalled peace purchased at the price of surender is not real 
peace or security 
powell who succeeded frank c carlucci in the national security 
advisers job when carlucci became secretary of defense last 
november said that in afghanistan angola and cambodia a kind of 
exhaustion has set in after years of brutal conflict 
in all these cases of success we also benefited from solid 
bipartisan congressional support and the support of the american 
people he said noting that in the case of afghanistan the 
mujahedeen antigovernment rebels enjoyed the support of the united 
states and several other countries 
i believe this administration understood this lesson and 
therefore deserves some of the credit for the winding down of those 
various conflicts powell said 
without mentioning the pitched battles the administration has had 
with congress over military assistance for the nicaraguan contra 
rebels he said that diplomacy is not going well and freedom is 
not winning precisely because effective resistance has been 
undercut 
the administration recently abandoned hope of getting congress to 
release 165 million in weapons stockpiled in honduras for use by 
the contras indicating the problem would have to be addressed by 
the next administration the congress did approve a 27 million 
humanitarian aid package 
powell also said that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev should 
be given credit for attempting to bring about economic reform but 
he said it remains to be seen how much improvement can be made 
under a communist oneparty system 
powell also said it has become clear that the soviets have chosen 
to pursue a policy of declining adventurism in foreign policy so 
they can focus energies and resources on internal economic 
reform 
the bold new leadership in the kremlin has candidly 
acknowledged the problems the soviet system faces he said but 
the problems are fundamental even structural 
soviet officials in moscow on thursday said they will begin 
liquidating unprofitable businesses and farms to bolster the 
nations economy and overcome a budget deficit expected to reach 58 
billion next year 
finance minister boris gostev told the supreme soviet legislature 
that gorbachevs government is finding it difficult to bring deficit 
spending under control 
our adversaries face a systemic crisis powell said they 
sense that their system is wrong but they are seeking to fix it 
without changing it wholesale it is not yet clear whether they can 
succeed 
the immediate problem theyre facing is an economic system that 
is not up to the demands of the 1990s and the 21st century he 
said in answer to a question from the audience 
powell said the soviets will be left behind in global 
economic competition unless they make the necessarty adjustments

prime minister anibal cavaco silva said constancio deserves the 
greatest respect for contributing to stabilizing democracy in 
portugal 
the resignation raises questions about the direction the 
socialists will take as the leading opposition party to cavaco 
silvas centerright social democratic government 
constancio and cavaco silva signed an accord two weeks ago to 
ensure the twothirds majority needed to push constitutional reforms 
through parliament but the socialist leadership crisis could delay 
debate on the changes 
the reforms will permit the sale of many companies nationalized 
after the 1974 leftist revolution they are seen as essential for 
modernization as portugal prepares for a single european economic 
community or common market in 1992 
constancio former finance minister and governor of the bank of 
portugal was elected socialist leader in june 1986 when veteran 
party leader mario soares was elected president 
the socialists vote increased in the last legislative elections 
in july 1987 but the social democrats won a landslide victory and 
formed portugals first majority government 
the social democrats hold 148 seats to the socialists 60 seats 
in the 250seat assembly of the republic smaller parties and 
factions hold the remaining seats

a civil rights coalition says its opponents in 
the reagan administration unwittingly served as catalysts helping 
the 100th congress build a productive civil rights record 
the leadership conference on civil rights lauded the 100th 
congress record citing legislation to strengthen the fair housing 
law restore civil rights protections invalidated by the supreme 
court and compensate japaneseamericans interned during world war ii 
the defeat of robert h bork a rigid conservative nominated for 
the supreme court also was listed as a major achievement 
coalition executive director ralph g neas said thursday that 
no previous congress has passed so many major civil rights 
statutes in such a short span 
even during the heyday of the 1960s civil rights movement neas 
said accomplishments were spread over several sessions of congress 
neas paid a backhanded tribute to former attorney general edwin 
meese iii and william bradford reynolds chief of the justice 
departments civil rights division the two men were architects of 
the administrations civil rights policies including opposition to 
race and sexbased quotas 
ironically the lasting legacy of edwin meese and william 
bradford reynolds may be that they served as a catalyst for the 
reaffirmation of our nations bipartisan commitment to equal 
opportunity for all our citizens neas said the reagan 
administration continued to compile the worst civil rights record of 
any administration in several decades 
neas added absent a tipping of the ideological balance of the 
supreme court i am confident that we will continue to move forward 
with the civil rights agenda 
en route to little rock ark aboard air force one on thursday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said obviously we dont 
agree with the coalitions assessment of the administration 
fitzwater contended that the number of enforcement actions 
against violators of the civil rights act whether in housing or 
employment or almost any other area are greater in this 
administration than theyve been in any past administration 
the leadership conference said 14 senators and 106 house members 
supported the coalition each time they voted on a designated civil 
rights issue three senators and 17 house members did not back the 
coalition on any of the designated votes 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen of texas 
voted for the designated issues 69 percent of the time while his 
republican vice presidential rival dan quayle of indiana had a 
rating of 15 percent 
neas said the four major civil rights accomplishments of the 
100th congress were 
defeat of bork who was opposed as too rigidly conservative by 
all the major civil rights organizations 
enactment of the fair housing amendments act of 1988 which gave 
the nations housing antidiscrimination law its first effective 
enforcement provisions the law also extends antidiscrimination 
coverage to the disabled and families with children 
the override of reagans veto of the civil rights restoration 
act an action which restored civil rights laws that had been 
invalidated by the supreme court the law allows cutoff of federal 
money to institutions discriminating against minorities women 
disabled people and older americans 
passage of the japaneseamerican redress act which apologizes 
to japaneseamericans interned during world war ii and authorizes 
payments of 20000 to survivors of the camps 
in addition neas noted that congress funded the legal service 
corp which the reagan administration has tried to put out of 
business and lawmakers reduced money for the us commission on 
civil rights which is under control of conservative reagan 
appointees 
other test issues included votes on the legalization program for 
illegal aliens pay equity disability rights programs for 
lowincome children and families and raising the minimum wage

an american family ritual comes around again 
this weekend the changing of the clocks 
this is the weekend most folks get an extra hour to sleep or 
carouse or whatever it is they like to do in the wee hours of the 
morning 
of course that means its also the weekend some people get stuck 
working an extra hour factory workers and convenience store 
clerks bartenders police and even some news reporters 
for most people though it simply means having to remember to 
set the clock back thats right back an hour before retiring 
saturday night 
technically the change occurs at 2 am local time which 
becomes 1 am and an hour is repeated 
or in the words of the uniform time act which set up the system 
of switching between daylight and standard times clocks are 
retarded an hour at 0200 on the last sunday in october 
the move to standard time means that darkness will come earlier 
in the evenings now with that hour of light shifted back to the 
morning hours to get the nation off to work on the right foot 
clocks will be advanced to daylight time next april 2 
reports the department of transportation which is responsible for 
keeping track of the semiannual switches 
thats the agency in charge of the time change because the system 
of uniform time zones was originally established more than a 
century ago to simplify time keeping for the nations railroads 
two other federal agencies share time keeping responsibilities 
for the nation however 
the us naval observatory in washington is in charge of telling 
us what time it is at any given time 
thats because knowing the exact time is important for navigators 
trying to determine their position by looking at the stars 
the observatory started giving the time out publicly in 1845 by 
dropping a red ball from a flagstaff daily at noon that gave 
sailors something by which to set their watches 
today atomic clocks keep the correct time and callers can get 
it by telephone by dialing 1900410time the call costs 50 cents 
the national institute of standards and technology formerly the 
national bureau of standards is in charge of defining time 
that is setting a standard for the exact length of time in a 
second minute and so forth 
while the official switch to standard time covers most of the 
nation a few states have taken matters into their own hands and 
exempted themselves since those places didnt spring forward to 
daylight time last spring they wont fall back this weekend 
included in the nonconformists are arizona hawaii the part of 
indiana located in the eastern time zone puerto rico the virgin 
islands and american samoa

the former cia chief who documented security 
problems at the new us embassy in moscow says president reagans 
recommendation that the building be razed and rebuilt shows 
reality caught up with us 
the united states has tended to be complacent over the years 
about soviet technology said james schlesinger the former 
defense secretary and cia director whom reagan commissioned to study 
the embassy in this case soviet technology turned out to be 
immensely and impressively sophisticated 
reagan on thursday said he wanted to erect a new 
americanbuilt embassy in moscow in place of the virtually 
completed eightstory us building because of the many listening 
devices that were built into it 
a state department source said the government had filed claims 
against the soviet union for 29 million in connection with 
defects and delays in the embassy construction 
the claims are to be negotiated by an arbitration panel in 
stockholm sweden 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity noted that the 
29 million does not include possible reparations by the soviets for 
the installation of eavesdropping devices in the building or the 
eventual costs to replace the building 
were talking to the soviets now in an attempt to settle how 
much such reparations might be the source said 
state department spokesman charles redman declined to say exactly 
what devices the united states had discovered in the embassy or how 
they had been installed because its never in anyones interest to 
let the other guy know what you know 
the soviet news agency tass in a dispatch from washington said 
us claims that the building is riddled with spying devices are 
groundless and obviously farfetched 
congress will be asked to approve construction of a new embassy 
made by us workers using american components imported under tight 
security the spokesman said 
redman said the price for dismantling and replacing the 190 
million embassy wont be known until new plans are drawn up but the 
costs will be worth it to ensure a secure workplace for us 
diplomats 
national security adviser colin powell predicted it will be a 
very expensive proposition a very very difficult task to put up a 
building in moscow 
schlesinger after surveying the situation in moscow last year 
had recommended that the three top floors of the new embassy be torn 
off and that the officials try to neutralize listening devices 
on lower floors he also proposed that a new and secure annex be 
built nearby where sensitive business could be conducted 
schlesinger said in an interview thursday that while reagans 
plan would be more costly it was reasonable and showed that 
reality caught up with us 
the decision embraced the most fundamental point that any 
area in the new office building that is to be secure must be torn 
down and rebuilt he added 
reagans proposal had been recommended by secretary of state 
george p shultz following several reviews of the project by us 
experts and offers the best overall solution to the problem 
redman said 
word that the new embassy was riddled with bugs first emerged as 
a hot topic in 1986 and concern heightened thereafter amid 
allegations that marines at the existing embassy in moscow had 
become involved with soviet women and allowed soviet agents to roam 
the building 
many of the charges in the socalled sexandspy scandal 
ultimately fizzled but one marine was convicted of espionage for 
giving the kgb the identities of cia agents and the floor plans to 
us embassies in moscow and vienna 
congressional and other inquiries over the past two years into 
the genesis of the embassy problems turned up early warning signs 
that went unheeded 
in 1972 the united states agreed to allow a soviet 
governmentowned construction firm to build the embassy a soviet 
engineer for five months worked with the american firm that designed 
the structure and large segments were assembled out of sight of 
us supervisors 
the arrangement led sen lawton chiles dfla to ask in 1987 
did we put in that agreement that we believed in the tooth fairy 
the us embassy in moscow is not the only facility in limbo 
while charges of ussoviet espionage are debated so is the new 
soviet embassy built in washington under the same 1972 agreement 
the soviets are barred from moving into the building until 
americans occupy their new embassy in moscow some us officials 
have expressed concern that the new soviet facility on mount alto 
one of the highest points in washington will allow the kgb to 
electronically eavesdrop on sensitive conversations in government 
buildings

farmers made a dramatic recovery in 1987 after 
years of financial torment says a new agriculture department review 
higher incomes lower operating costs a 45 percent increase in 
government payments and a modest rise in farm product sales 
contributed to the improvement the departments economic research 
service said thursday 
the report said net income in 1987 reached 38 billion after 
adjusting for inflation the highest level since the mid1970s and 
was on a par with that of the 1950s and 1960s 
the 176page analysis did not forecast 1988 financial returns or 
assess the impact of this years drought however other reports 
have pointed to net cash income at or near the record 1987 level 
but economists quickly note that thousands of farmers have been 
hurt severely in 1988 by drought losses to crops and livestock while 
others have prospered because of the reduced supplies and higher 
prices 
in 1987 rising land values which represent 70 percent of all 
farm assets and lower debt boosted the equity or net worth of 
farmers as of jan 1 1988 to 571 billion from 537 billion a year 
earlier the report said that reversed a sixyear decline 
the most dramatic farm financial change in the past few years 
has been the improvement in the solvency position of farms the 
report said 
solvency or the ability to pay debts is one of the measures of 
financial health in the farm sector others include liquidity or 
the capability of making payments when they come due and 
profitability or net farm income 
higher net farm income in 1987 helped farmers reduce or pay off 
debt and provided more farms with enough capital to avoid new debt 
financing than in previous years the report said asset values 
rose 3 percent over those of 1986 while debt fell 8 percent to 143 
billion in 1987 the fourth annual decline in a row leaving the 
sector in the best position at any time in the 1980s to meet debt 
service obligations 
according to the annual survey of farm costs and returns nearly 
80 percent of the nations farms were profitable in 1987 up from 70 
percent in 1986 the report said that nearly 44 percent of all farms 
were free of debt at the beginning of 1988 compared with less than 
39 percent a year earlier 
there was a large variation however in debt owed by different 
size farms only 16 percent of the largest those with sales of 
more than 500000 a year were free of debt at the start of this 
year compared with almost 60 percent of the smallest farms or 
those with sales of less than 10000 annually

this years droughtshriveled soybean harvest 
has reduced us supplies and boosted market prices but agriculture 
department experts say the biggest impact will be on foreign sales 
soybean production is estimated at about 15 billion bushels 
down 22 percent from last year with the yield per harvested acre 
dropping to 264 bushels from an average of 337 in 1987 
on sept 1 the beginning of the new season the us soybean 
stockpile was 302 million bushels compared with 436 million a year 
earlier 
a new outlook report by the departments economic research 
service said thursday that the season average price received for 
soybeans in 198889 is expected to average 7 to 9 per bushel 
while meal prices may be in the range of 225 to 275 per ton and 
oil prices 22 cents to 27 cents per pound 
most of the adjustment to smaller soybean supplies will occur 
in the export accounts the report said domestic crush for 
meal and oil will be reduced 13 percent to 102 billion bushels 
but soybean exports will be lowered nearly 30 percent to 565 million 
bushels 
soybean meal exports will decline even more sharply by 38 
percent to 42 million tons the report said 
but analysts added that domestic use of meal is forecast to drop 
only 6 percent in 198889 because livestock and poultry inventories 
are not expected to decline significantly mainly because corn 
prices have not soared as much as in other drought years 
soybean oil exports are expected to decline to about 135 billion 
pounds from last years unusually high level of 19 billion 
pounds the report said

researchers studying an antibodybased drug 
used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs say that it may be 
a powerful cancer fighter when used in low dosages 
in a study published today in science a group of researchers led 
by jeffrey bluestone of the university of chicago report that an 
antibody called anticd3 triggered an immune response in laboratory 
mice that was able to stop the growth of tumors 
bluestone said that anticd3 known as okt3 in the form used on 
humans has been used in more than 15000 patients to stop rejection 
episodes following organ transplants 
in large doses anticd3 prevents t cells a major component of 
the immune system from initiating an immune response against 
foreign tissue such as a transplanted kidney or liver 
but in experiments in laboratory mice bluestone said very small 
doses of a mouse type of anticd3 seem to energize t cells to 
initiate a strong immune response against tumors 
it takes the immune system and gives it a little boost he 
said 
some tumors typically will trigger a mild immune response but it 
often is not powerful enough to stop or retard the tumor growth he 
said by administering anticd3 this response is amplified 
bluestone and a team of researchers studied this effect by giving 
laboratory mice low doses of anticd3 at the same time that the mice 
were injected with a transplanted tumor other mice also were 
injected with the tumor but did not receive the anticd3 
in those mice receiving the anticd3 68 percent failed to 
develop tumors mice not injected with the antibody died from the 
tumors within six weeks 
sixty days later the mice that received the antibody were 
exposed again to the same type of tumor and bluestone said the 
cancer failed to grow indicating that the mice had developed a 
tumorspecific immunity 
bluestone said there have been no clinical studies testing 
whether this anticancer effect would work on human tumors and he 
said that some cancers do not provoke an immune response and would 
not benefit from anticd3 therapy 
the technique is not now available for human application 
science which published the report today is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science coauthors of 
the report with bluestone were joshua ellenhorn and hans schreiber 
of the university of chicago and raphael hirsch of the national 
cancer institute

some antibodies that usually fight infection 
may actually assist the aids virus in its deadly march through the 
body a group of researchers reported today in the journal science 
francis a ennis of the university of massachusetts medical 
school said that in test tube studies his group found that the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv that causes aids may hitch a ride on 
a type of antibody in order to infect certain types of cells and 
spread throughout the body 
these antibodies can provide the virus a trojan horse mechanism 
whereby the virus can enter certain cells said ennis its a 
mechanism by which antibodies that usually prevent a virus from 
infecting the cell are actually helping the virus get into the cell 
to infect 
ennis said the antibody study was conducted using serum a clear 
fluid in blood that was taken from patients who were known to have 
aids 
he said the serum was first diluted by a ratio of 1 part serum to 
100 parts sterile water and then exposed to human cells in a test 
tube at that concentration said ennis there were enough 
antibodies attacking or blocking the aids virus to prevent it from 
multiplying in new cells antibodies that act in this way are said 
to be neutralizing antibodies 
however when the serum was further diluted in ratios from 
1to1000 and higher the neutralizing antibodies could no longer 
control the aids spread instead another type of antibody called 
an enhancing antibody became dominant and the aids virus was able 
to invade and infect new cells 
ennis said the pathway used to invade the cells was different 
from the generally accepted infection method a number of studies 
have shown that the hiv virus enters certain cells by binding with a 
protein on the cells surface called the cd4 receptor 
in ennis study his group demonstrated that the virus can also 
enter certain cells that have another type of surface protein 
receptor called the fc 
the study showed that the virus rides into the cells through the 
fc receptor by first attaching itself to immunoglobulin g a large 
molecule that is one of the bodys main defenses against bacteria 
immunoglobulin g said ennis is a yshaped molecule that carries 
the fc receptor on the main stem of the y he said it can join with 
the aids virus cradling the killer between the arms of the y and 
then enter cells through the fc receptor carrying the aids virus in 
with it 
we think there is an antibody response to the virus that is 
detrimental and that some of these antibodies that bind to the virus 
actually help the virus infect cells said ennis the patients 
would be better off if they didnt have those antibodies 
cells used in the study were monocytes and macrophages which are 
immunity cells that are known to be attacked by the aids virus in 
patients who have the disease these cells have both the fc and the 
cd4 receptors 
more studies will be required he said before scientists can 
determine precisely what role immunoglobulin g has in the 
progression of aids in patients the studies by ennis group were 
conducted in test tubes but the scientist said this new 
understanding may have to be taken into consideration in the design 
of a vaccine against aids 
dr robert c gallo a national institutes of health scientist 
and codiscoverer of the aids virus said the finding has been 
confirmed but not published by other groups 
it has implications that could be quite important he said 
it could be of clinical relevance because it may have to be 
taken into consideration in developing drugs to fight aids 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that destroys the bodys immune system and makes it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus most 
often is spread through close contact with blood blood products or 
semen from infected persons 
as of oct 17 aids had been diagnosed in 75768 americans of 
whom 42653 had died no one is known to have recovered from aids 
science which published the study today is the journal for the 
american association for the advancement of science coauthoring the 
report with ennis was dr akira takeda of the university of 
massachusetts medical school

federal aviation administration officials are 
assuring the public that their new requirements for rivet 
replacements and inspections on aging boeing 737s do not mean the 
passenger jets are unsafe 
the agency on thursday stepped up its efforts to detect existing 
cracks and prevent new ones on the aircraft 
the faa tightened a schedule it had imposed earlier for the 
replacement of 7200 rivets on the 291 oldest 737s including about 
100 flown by american carriers it also ordered airlines to conduct 
electronic inspections of the fasteners and to fly each aircraft at 
low altitudes until it has been examined 
these precautions are over and above those we feel are needed 
to maintain safety said anthony broderick the faas associate 
administrator if we had any question at all about the safety of 
the planes flying tomorrow we wouldnt let the airplanes fly 
boeing spokesman jack gamble echoed brodericks assessment 
saying this isnt an emergency kind of thing 
there would be no massive grounding of planes under the faa 
orders individual 737s would be taken out of service only while 
their rivets were being replaced 
the faa estimated it would take 2016 hours to complete the work 
on each aircraft and would cost us airlines 8 million for the 
work on all 100 of their planes 
the old 737s built between 1967 and 1971 used a type of rivet 
since discontinued that is now believed to cause cracks in the 
fuselage skin 
the fasteners to be replaced run along the length of the planes 
both above and below the windows 
after the roof of an aloha airlines boeing 737 tore off in flight 
last april 28 killing one person and injuring 61 others the faa 
ordered rivet replacements for each 737 before it made 80000 
flights 
the faa on thursday set a new schedule under which the fasteners 
would have to be replaced within 36 months if a plane has flown 
fewer than 40000 times graduating to within six months if the 
craft has made 70000 flights or more 
the agency also ordered that all 737s with more than 40000 
landings be limited to altitudes of 26000 feet until electronic 
inspections of the rivets are made flying at lower altitudes limits 
the amount of pressurizing and depressurizing that occurs within the 
cabin thus reducing stress on the fuselage 
immediately after the aloha incident the faa had ordered that 
737s with more than 55000 landings be kept below altitudes of 
23000 feet that limitation was superseded by thursdays order 
last spring the faa ordered inspections for 737s with 30000 or 
more flights but the examinations ordered thursday were more 
intensive 
concern over cracks in aging 737s have escalated in recent weeks 
earlier this month cracks of up to one foot in length were 
discovered by chance on a continental airlines 737 
the air transport association says there were 570 of the 737s 
used in the united states at the end of 1987 but that many were 
newer models according to boeing 212 of the 737s flown by 19 us 
airlines had taken 30000 or more flights 
carriers that use 737s widely are united airlines continental 
delta air lines piedmont airlines usair and southwest airlines 
the new schedule for rivet replacement was technically a proposal 
for which the faa said it would accept comments from the aerospace 
industry and the public until dec 12 
but broderick said there isnt any question that those rivets 
will be removed and replaced the only question is the details of 
the schedule

for years the us coast guard has wanted to 
buy a new icebreaker but the reagan administration balked at 
spending 300 million and just this month scrapped the proposal 
again then came the whales then came the russians 
the use of two soviet icebreakers in a bid to save two whales 
trapped off point barrow alaska is prompting a renewed request by 
the coast guard to bolster the us icebreaking fleet 
the coast guard now has only three saltwater icebreakers and one 
of them is scheduled for decommissioning in january the service is 
resubmitting its request for money to build a new one to the white 
house budget office sources said thursday 
the sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said the 
white house office of management and budget earlier this month 
turned down the coast guards proposal to include 300 million for a 
new icebreaker in the administrations proposed budget for fiscal 
1990 
the coast guards commandant adm paul a yost jr declined to 
confirm or deny that his agency was asking the white house to 
reconsider saying only that the administration has never asked 
congress for the money despite the annual pleas of his agency dating 
back to president carters administration 
but yost said the trapped whales the role of the soviets in 
saving them and the world attention focused on the herculean effort 
have definitely been a positive impetus toward us getting a new 
icebreaker 
congress has directed that we build a new icebreaker and now 
its just up to the coast guard and the administration to see if we 
can fit one into the 1990 budget he said 
congress in 1986 ordered the construction of two new icebreakers 
by 1990 after a study by the administration concluded that the coast 
guard should have a minimum of four and better yet five in its 
fleet 
but nothing has happened since then because of federal budget 
deficits exceeding 150 billion each of the past three years and 
bickering over whether the coast guard should build a new ship or 
lease it from private companies as part of the administrations 
privatization goals 
over the past two years the coast guard has spent 2 million 
designing a new icebreaker the agency estimates the cost of 
construction at 300 million for one and 500 million for two if 
they are ordered at the same time 
even then a new icebreaker will take a minimum of seven years to 
build yost said 
meanwhile crowley maritime co of san francisco which now 
provides icebreaking services for oil companies operating on 
alaskas north slope has offered to build lease and operate an 
icebreaker crewed by civilians but commanded by coast guard officers 
for 40 million a year 
the coast guard was initially interested in our proposal two 
years ago and it fit in perfectly with the administrations 
privatization goals said tim mills a washington attorney 
retained by crowley to push the venture but then the coast guard 
changed its mind weve quit working on it 
kurt oxley the house merchant marine and fisheries committees 
counsel for coast guard and navigation issues said the panel would 
prefer that the coast guard build and staff the ship 
but oxley and coast guard officials said all sides on the issue 
are rethinking their positions in light of the rescue of the two 
whales 
the whales trapped in the ice have raised the spectre of whats 
wrong with the american icebreaking fleet and the answer is 
everything oxley said with only two we have to use them 
sparingly with four or five we could spread them out more evenly 
and possibly have had one up there 
the united states now has three icebreakers two 399foot sister 
ships the polar star and the polar sea built in the 1970s and 
based in seattle and the 43yearold northwind based at wilmington 
nc the northwind is scheduled for decommissioning in january 
in the 1960s the united states had eight icebreakers all of 
world war ii vintage 
the polar sea is now in drydock in preparation for a resupply 
mission to antarctic in january the polar star is off nova scotia 
en route back to seattle through the panama canal after it was 
unable to break through the iceclogged beaufort sea west of prudhoe 
bay two weeks ago it had to head east through the northwest passage 
following the rescue of two icestuck canadian ships 
yost said the united states probably would have called on the 
soviet unions ship for help in any case since it was only 300 
miles away and had open water most of the way to where the whales 
were trapped 
no icebreaker not ours the russians or the canadians 
could have broken through from the west or east where the polar star 
was he said and our seattle icebreaker was 3500 miles away 
with one two or even three new icebreakers the united states 
would remain well behind the soviets which has a fleet of 16 
including four powered by nuclear reactors according to the coast 
guard 
the soviet union is an arctic nation they need that many 
yost said we dont need that many were not an arctic nation 
but we do need at least four polar icebreakers i think one will be 
all we can afford next year maybe well get another one in the 
years beyond that

violent crime in new york city rose a startling 
129 percent in the first seven months of this year due mainly to 
an explosion in crack and the summer heat wave police said 
murder and manslaughter was up 109 percent in the first seven 
months of 1988 as compared to the same period in 1987 and was 277 
percent higher this july as compared to july 1987 said deputy chief 
allan hoehl of the departments office of management analysis and 
planning 
if murder rates keep increasing at the same pace well wind up 
coming close to the alltime high we hit in 1981 hoehl said 
thursday that year the city recorded 1826 murder and manslaughter 
cases 
in the first seven months of this year 1030 people died at the 
hands of criminals a total of 1672 people were killed in 1987 
in july when temperatures soared into the 90s for days at a 
time the city averaged six murders a day forty murders were logged 
in one weekend 
hoehl said there was no doubt in his mind that drug use and 
crack in particular was the main culprit in the figures released 
wednesday at police headquarters 
there was a lot of hot weather in july but the main reason is 
the explosion of crack said hoehl 
aggravated assault also was up for the first seven months of this 
year rising 129 percent to 41566 over a year ago

in a series of interviews democrat 
michael dukakis has seemed to begin second guessing his own campaign 
strategy even as he works to close the gap with george bush in the 
few days left to him 
in a succession of television and newspaper interviews the 
democratic presidential nominee acknowledged the critics may be 
right when they say he squandered much of his lead in the polls by 
his cautious and reluctant response to bushs strong assaults on his 
record 
and dukakis acknowledged he may have erred in making what was 
perhaps his most memorable line of the general election campaign 
his assertion at the democratic national convention that this 
election was about competence not ideology 
should the speech in atlanta have been more explicit more of a 
statement of philosophy positions dukakis himself asked 
rhetorically in an interview this week with the washington post 
perhaps he concluded 
that statement has been derided repeatedly since the july 
convention by a republican opposition that was eager to depict him 
as a massachusetts liberal out of step with the nation 
highlighting the ridicule was bushs assertion in his convention 
address that this election isnt only about competence for 
competence is a narrow ideal competence makes the trains run on 
time but doesnt know where theyre going 
competence was a centerpiece of the massachusetts governors 
rationale for seeking the presidency his 10 years as a chief 
executive presiding over a state that has had a stunning economic 
turnaround 
but his suggestion that ideology would take a back seat to 
management was an opening the bush campaign has exploited 
apparently with success so far to depict dukakis as a democrat 
who seeks to hide his ideology to appeal to an electorate more 
conservative after eight years under ronald reagan 
dukakis told the newspaper that he might better have used the 
convention opportunity when the nation was watching to lay out 
values and philosophy fundamental differences between me and 
george bush 
dukakis delivered what also sounded like premature postmortums 
in interviews with dan rather on the cbs evening news thursday 
night and earlier in the week in interviews with ted koppel on 
abcs nightline and with larry king on cable news network 
asked about the competenceandideology issue on cbs dukakis 
said he had not gotten it backward 
but i guess what i was trying to say he said was its 
not a matter of ideology in terms of left or right its your 
philosphy of government do you believe government should be on the 
side of the average american doing things to make it possible 
for our people to hold good jobs educate their children live in a 
clean and wholesome environment 
dukakis repeated an acknowledgement made earlier in the week when 
he said perhaps he waited too long to begin forceful responses to 
bushs attack on his record on crime the environment patriotism 
and other issues even running mate lloyd bentsen had urged him to 
respond sooner personally and in television commercials 
well i did it but perhaps more subtly than i should have or 
than lloyd bentsen suggested dukakis said on cbs 
why i guess because im fundamentally a positive person im 
not in politics and public service to cut up the other guy 
as you know i resisted going on the attack or the 
counterattack he added well in retrospect maybe i should have 
reacted more strongly 
he said it clearly on abc when koppel asked how it was that the 
bush campaign has absolutely nailed your hide to the wall so far 
perhaps i responded too late perhaps i should have been out 
there attacking and counterattacking from the beginning dukakis 
said 
many democrats complain dukakis and his campaign ignored their 
pleadings to move early in the summer to counter republican 
criticisms that seemed to go beyond the narrow specifics and became 
symbols of larger issues and even values the willie horton case 
became a matter of attitudes about crime and permissiveness 
but dukakis did respond personally and forcefully just four days 
after labor day in a speech in east texas when he likened 
republican tactics to mccarthyism 
but after one tough speech he seemed to let it drop 
dukakis acknowledged on cnn a certain amount of frustration 
now as a result of his reluctance to respond and he seemed to 
acknowledge his campaigns difficulty in adjusting to the larger 
role of becoming the partys nominee 
youre suddenly in a very different world who says what for 45 
seconds on the six oclock news makes the difference in the 
particular day and it took us a while to understand that he said 
francis obrien a senior adviser to dukakis said dukakis and 
the campaign were not backing off the competencenotideology 
statement but he said it has conceded tactical error in the 
response to bush 
thats the nature of michael dukakis obrien said his 
nature is to be positive

more than 20 years ago us intelligence 
agencies warned there could be security problems if soviet workers 
were allowed to help construct a new us embassy in moscow 
those warnings aside a 1972 agreement was reached under which 
the united states allowed a governmentowned soviet construction 
firm to build the embassy 
a soviet engineer for five months worked with the american firm 
that designed the structure and large segments were assembled 
offsite out of sight of us supervisors 
the arrangement led sen lawton chiles dfla to ask in 1987 
did we put in that agreement that we believed in the tooth fairy 
president reagan announced thursday that the virtually finished 
embassy would have to be demolished because theres no way to rid 
it of the many listenng devices he said the new version would be 
americanbuilt 
in an interview thursday james schlesinger the former defense 
secretary and cia chief whom reagan commissioned to study the 
problem said the presidents decision to raze the structure shows 
reality caught up with us 
the united states has tended to be complacent over the years 
about soviet technology he said in this case soviet 
technology turned out to be immensely and impressively 
sophisticated 
schlesinger after surveying the situation in moscow last year 
recommended that the three top floors of the eightstory building be 
torn off and that the united states try to neutralize listening 
devices on the lower floors he also proposed that a new and 
secure annex be built nearby where sensitive business could be 
conducted 
schlesinger said that while reagans plan would be more costly 
it was a reasonable decision 
the decision embraced the most fundamental point that any 
area in the new office building that is to be secure must to torn 
down and rebuilt he said 
word that the new embassy was riddled with bugs first emerged as 
a hot topic in 1986 and concern heightened thereafter amid 
allegations that marines at the existing embassy in moscow had 
become involved with soviet women and allowed soviet agents to roam 
the building 
many of the charges in the socalled sexandspy scandal 
ultimately fizzled but one marine was convicted of espionage for 
giving the kgb the identities of cia agents and the floor plans to 
us embassies in moscow and vienna 
congressional and other inquiries over the past two years into 
the genesis of the embassy problems turned up early warning signs 
that went unheeded 
rep olympia snowe rmaine was among those who visited the 
embassy in 1987 at a hearing last year she read from a 1967 memo 
that warned unless we take the most stringent precautions we run 
the risk that the new us embassy in moscow could be penetrated 
by sophisticated listening techniques 
ronald spiers undersecretary of state for management said at 
the hearing the 1972 construction agreement was concluded on orders 
from white house officials who made it clear that they wanted an 
agreement signed quickly apparently in time for a planned visit 
by thensoviet foreign minister andrei gromyko 
the soviets have consistently denounced charges they bugged the 
us embassy and responded last year by displaying bugs and other 
gadgets they claimed the americans had planted in soviet missions 
foreign ministry spokesman boris pyadyshev called it material 
evidence of who is really intruding into the sovereign territory of 
others 
the us embassy in moscow is not the only facility in limbo 
while charges of ussoviet espionage are debated so is the new 
soviet embassy built in washington under the same 1972 agreement 
the soviets are barred from moving into the building until 
americans occupy their new embassy in moscow some us officials 
have expressed concern that the new soviet facility on mount alto 
one of the highest points in washington will allow the kgb to 
electronically eavesdrop on sensitive conversations in government 
buildings

solos toward the end patterns such as one in which two couples 
danced in front of a center couple then danced apart to frame the 
center couple were developed

a man who just wanted a closer look at a 
huge buck says he was rammed by the deer and chased up a tree before 
police rescued him officers then shot the animal as it charged one 
of them 
i thought sure enough i was a goner said benjamin kirkland 
26 of his close encounter with a 225pound eightpoint deer

minutes in the tree before his cries for help were heard by people 
who called police he was not seriously injured

friday after working on a pipeline when he saw the large buck 
grazing in a field a few hundred yards behind the motel in this town 
25 miles northwest of minneapolis 
where im from deer just dont get as big as that he said 
kirkland said he crawled behind an embankment planning to sneak 
up behind the buck and get a look without being detected but when 
he reached the spot where he thought the buck would be there was 
nothing 
he stood up to walk away and the buck was 30 steps away staring 
at him 
kirkland froze generally a buck deer like that is going to 
break and run to get away from you hes supposed to be way scareder 
of you than you are of him kirkland said 
but this deer began walking toward kirkland who said he thought 
it must be somebodys pet the deer came up and smelled him then 
charged slamming its antlers into kirklands ribs he said 
the deer then slammed kirkland into a pine tree and he grabbed 
onto the tree and scampered up it 
i knew that tree was going to save me it was the only way 
out kirkland said 
he said he sat in the tree about 40 minutes with the buck pacing 
below and pawing the ground before his rescue 
elk river patrolman dave sievert called in a state patrol officer 
and a reserve officer to hlp and killed the buck when it lowered 
its head and started charging them 
roger holmes chief of the minnesota department of natural 
resources wildlife section said hes sure the deer was raised by 
humans and released such deer lose their fear of humans and when 
excited can become dangerous to people he said 
this just does not happen with a truly wild deer said 
holmes i have never heard of a situation where a wild buck has

the communist party secretary who shocked the world 
by criticizing politburo members andrei a gromyko and mikhail s 
solomentsev on national television says he had no idea they would be 
retired three months later 
the blunt call for resignations was my idea and nobody 
prompted me said vladimir i melnikov a provincial party 
secretary and delegate to the supreme soviet the legislature which 
is meeting this week in moscow 
but the rotund russian laughed during an interview thursday and 
said that when he returned home to komi an autonomous region in the 
frozen far north everybody asked me if it was sanctioned by 
somebody 
melnikov became a celebrity when he suggested in an exchange 
televised first in the soviet union and then on news shows worldwide 
that aging soviet leaders who actively promoted the policy of 
stagnation may not serve and work on the central party and 
government bodies now at the time of perestroika they should 
answer for everything and do so personally 
he made the remarks june 30 at a communist party conference 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev who spearheaded perestroika 
or restructuring of soviet society then asked melnikov to be more 
specific 
maybe you have some concrete suggestions gorbachev asked 
were sitting here and dont know is he talking about me or 
somebody else 
melnikov replied that he was speaking about four people the 
78yearold gromyko then president and previously foreign minister 
for 28 years the 74yearold solomentsev then head of the party 
control commission viktor g afanasyev editor of the communist 
party newspaper pravda and georgy a arbatov a soviet expert on 
the united states 
solomentsev and gromyko were retired in the politburo shakeup 
sept 30 that solidified gorbachevs power 
afanasyev will be the next to go and soon diplomatic sources in 
moscow said on condition of anonymity these sources said arbatov 
seems secure so far 
melnikov said the fate of afanasyev and arbatov was a ticklish 
question and left it up to the party leadership to decide 
i already expressed my opinion he said 
melnikov said he sat up late on the night before his speech 
deciding what he wanted to say for two days he had watched an 
unprecedented demonstration of glasnost gorbachevs policy of 
openness 
i decided i should reply what i think melnikov said and he 
thought that part of the blame for stagnation the description now 
given to the rule of soviet president leonid i brezhnev should 
be laid on people who were working then 
at the last minute he thought it possible that gorbachev who 
had been commenting on many of the speeches might ask him to be 
specific so he scribbled the names of the four men on the cover of 
his speech text 
i think that this is a question that ripened a long time ago 
melnikov said i expressed not only my opinion but also that of 
many delegates at the conference 
at home the attitude toward me completely changed melnikov 
said obviously i expressed what the people thought

michael dukakis is locked in a close fight in 
new york despite a hefty democratic enrollment advantage and the 
presence of popular gov mario cuomo in his corner 
independent polls released thursday indicate that the democratic 
stronghold once considered firmly in the dukakis column has become 
a tossup with 11 days remaining until election day 
a marist college institute for public opinion poll had dukakis 
leading republican presidential nominee george bush 47 percent to 
43 percent while a new york post poll had bush ahead 4644 the 
marist poll had a margin of error of four percentage points while 
the post surveys margin was five points 
he bush is ahead in new york theres no question about that 
in my mind rep guy molinari bushs new york campaign chairman 
said thursday 
al gordon a cuomo political operative who is serving as dukakis 
new york campaign director said the race has become one of those 
deadeven situations 
new york its 36 electoral votes making it second only to 
california is considered crucial to dukakis bush strategists look 
upon it as potential icing on the cake 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle made one of his 
rare visits to a major state with a stop in syracuse ny thursday 
night and with a win possible molinari said hes lobbying hard to 
get bush to make a swing across the state next week 
the idea that bush might take new york despite a 32 enrollment 
edge for democrats shouldnt come as a complete surprise ronald 
reagan carried the state in both 1980 and 1984 
one of the misnomers is that new york is such a democratic 
state that whatever happens nationally doesnt affect it said 
gordon that obviously isnt true six out of the last 10 
presidential elections in new york have gone to republicans 
in hopes of preventing no 7 cuomo has been campaigning steadily 
for dukakis in recent weeks with the new york governor spending at 
least one day a week on the road for the democratic nominee 
cuomos itinerary has included california texas connecticut 
rhode island and massachusetts earlier this week the new york 
governor traveled to chicago and indianapolis to talk up dukakis 
but top democratic media specialist david garth said he thinks 
its strange that the dukakis campaign in danger of losing new 
york hasnt asked cuomo to make produkakis television ads that 
could be used in the huge new york city media market 
i have a feeling theyre going through the motions more than 
anything else in new york complained the new york citybased 
consultant to dukakis national campaign organization have they 
asked mario to make a spot for them thats got to be crazy if they 
didnt 
gordon said that while the national campaign had been approached 
about making some tv ads featuring cuomo for use in new york the 
idea was rejected by a dukakis headquarters that favored relying on 
their national ad campaign 
thats one thing theyve been pretty firm on out of boston 
that they want to keep on their pattern of commercials said the 
new york campaign director 
gordon said dukakis national campaign had authorized a radio ad 
featuring cuomo that will begin running in new york this weekend 
new yorks two other bigname democrats new york city mayor 
edward koch and us sen daniel patrick moynihan have been barely 
visible on the dukakis campaign 
koch who upset many new york blacks when he said during aprils 
new york primary campaign that jews would have to be crazy to 
vote for democratic candidate jesse jackson was dispatched to 
florida earlier this month by the dukakis camp to campaign for that 
states sizable jewish vote 
koch proceeded to praise president reagan as a great friend of 
israel the mayor hasnt been back out on the dukakis campaign trail 
since 
moynihan facing a nominal challenge in his bid for a third 
senate term recently said he hadnt been doing much dukakis 
campaigning because he hadnt been asked 
he will mention dukakis in saturdays debate hes vowed to do 
so because hes been asked about it said moynihan campaign 
spokesman lawrence odonnell jr of the senators plans for his 
final debate against republican challenger robert mcmillan 
in their first debate monday night moynihan didnt mention 
dukakis in an interview with the new york post on wednesday 
however moynihan did talk about dukakis saying that he didnt 
think the democratic nominee would win nationally and that cuomo 
would have been a better candidate

peace overtures with tamil militants state radio said thursday

sportscaster bob costas might do well to drop 
his smartaleck style of humor which can alienate athletes his nbc 
colleague ahmad rashad says in his forthcoming autobiography 
its too much like the wit youd get from a kid who sits in the 
stands making fun of the tackle whos a little too fat and slow or 
of the gangly defensive back who trips over his own feet rashad 
the wide receiverturned sportscaster writes in the oct 29 issue 
of tv guide magazine 
athletes resent that kind of humor because that same wiseguy 
kid wouldnt ever put himself on the line by trying to make the 
team rashad said in an excerpt from his book rashad vikes 
mikes and something on the backside 
you cant cut a guy up with a few quips and keep the respect of 
the players you might get a laugh from your fans you might get 
every interview you want because youre a powerful media figure but 
the players secretly will lose respect for you

israeli parties are spending about 30 million 
on the nov 1 election campaign and a large chunk of that is 
donated by people not even eligible to vote jews who live abroad 
the fundraising process is shrouded in secrecy primarily 
because the law does not require public disclosure but reports 
indicate both the rightwing likud bloc and the leftist labor party 
have raised millions of dollars abroad 
the usbased antidefamation league of bnai brith estimated 
more than 50 million dollars may be raised by israels parties 
with onethird of it coming from the united states and elsewhere 
overseas 
michal cohen spokeswoman of foreign minister shimon peres labor 
party said most of the big sums are from abroad 
most of the money is from overseas the united states canada 
france the jews of south africa the lions share is from the 
united states she said without elaborating 
a spokesman for the likud leader prime minister yitzhak shamir 
confirmed funds are coming from abroad even though shamir frequently 
has criticized outside jewish groups for taking stands on divisive 
political issues 
thats the way it is and both parties do it said yossi 
ahimeir shamirs spokesman its possible this is an issue that 
should be reconsidered 
the antidefamation league has urged israel to amend the 
elections law to require full disclosure of foreign sources of 
funding 
it is unhealthy to have outsiders so heavily influencing 
elections in a country where they dont live said harry wall 
head of the leagues israeli branch it invites diaspora jews into 
the debate 
some observers say this is only natural given israels 
traditionally close ties with jews overseas 
jews in america do not and should not have decisionmaking 
powers but it is in israels interest for them to be as involved as 
possible and to express what kind of a jewish state they want 
said emanuel gutman a political scientist 
swiss millionaire bruce rappoport had lunch with peres recently 
and the independent hadashot newspaper said he contributed 15 
million to labor 
us millionaire meshulam riklis contributed 1 million to likud 
the newspaper said 
the washington post has reported peres raised 2 million during a 
nineday trip to the united states in june and that former un 
ambassador benjamin netanyahu raised almost 1 million for likud on 
a similar visit 
labor contributors include cbs chairman lawrence tisch walt 
disney chairman michael eisner and chicago businessman philip 
klutznick according to the boston globe 
israels political financing law provides half the campaign 
funding by allocating each party 123750 for every member of 
parliament 
thus each major party receives about 5 million a sum that may 
be doubled through private fundraising efforts 
the laws loopholes are numerous 
although corporate contributions are outlawed there is no 
ceiling on individual contributions 
former state comptrollers yitzhak tunik and yaacov maltz have 
suggested in previous campaigns that individual contributions as 
high as 500000 may be masking business donations they declined 
comment on the current campaign 
while us laws carry both civil and criminal penalties the only 
penalty prescribed by israeli law is to withhold 15 percent of the 
government funding if one exceeds the allowed expenditures 
us law bars donations from foreign nationals and limits 
individual contributions to 1000 and donations of political action 
committees to 5000 public disclosure is necessary 
in israel only the state comptroller oversees the partys books 
and the information is never made public 
but in an interview former attorney general yitzhak zamir said 
this aspect of the law has never been put to a court test and it is 
possible a court would overturn the secrecy clause 
one likud member of parliament michael eitan has proposed 
amending the law to limit individual contributions to about 3000 
and said he will resubmit his proposal after the elections 
its become a scandal a national holiday with a lot of money 
being spent and a real disruption to the state eitan said 
he called for a shorter campaigning period with more public 
debates and fewer paid advertisements

the federal communications commission has 
decided to relax its rule on ownership of more than one radio 
station 
the new rule would allow commonly owned stations to be as close 
as 25 miles apart as long as they are in different markets 
the rule would reduce by about half the distance required between 
two stations owned by the same person or company and it would allow 
common ownership of stations in adjacent markets 
the fcc said the new rule will enable more station owners to take 
greater advantage of the economies of scale and cost savings that 
result from common ownership of stations 
the fcc also agreed to recommend that congress require cable 
companies to negotiate with outoftown tv stations for the rights 
to carry their signals the commission is expected to extend that 
recommendation to cover local tv signals before it issues a final 
order in the matter

a business executive says robert strauss 
cochairman of the national economic commission has said he 
believes his panel will support a 120 billion deficit reduction 
package split evenly between budget cuts and increased taxes 
john sloan president of the national federation of independent 
business said strauss told business leaders on wednesday that he 
thinks he has nine votes on the 12member commission for 60 
billion in government spending cuts and 60 billion in tax increases 
to close the budget gap 
but james hildreth a spokesman for the commission quoted 
strauss as terming sloans version of the meeting totally 
inaccurate 
all he said at the dinner was that the most support he could 
hope to get for any program would probably be eight or nine votes 
out of the current 12 members hildreth said but he denies 
saying in any way shape or form what the final package will be 
the commission was created by congress to recommend how to 
eliminate the federal budget deficit which totaled an estimated 
150 billion for the fiscal year ending sept 30 
the panel has set a deadline of finishing its work by dec 21

republican policies have turned the united 
states into an international debtor dependent on foreign investors 
to sustain an economy saddled with huge trade and budget deficits 
democrat lloyd bentsen told a los angeles foreign affairs group 
saying the republicans didnt recognize the threat of 
international economic competition bentsen told the world affairs 
council the united states must be able to compete not only 
militarily but economically if it is to lead the free world and 
set an example for developing nations 
i would suggest that it will profit america little to gain the 
whole world of military superiority if we lose the soul of our 
economic capacity he said thursday it will profit us little to 
be military hawks if the competition is between economic eagles and 
we are sitting ducks 
bentsen said the republicans were instead spending their time 
distorting the democrats position 
they have twisted the truth to imply that gov dukakis is an 
apostle of military weakness he said thats just not so 
both parties planned to spend the same money on defense he said 
but the democrats wanted to spend more on planes tanks and guns and 
less on nuclear weapons and star wars he said 
bentsen also argued that american allies should within four years 
be made to pay an equal share of the costs of defending the free 
world and he said japan should cover the 35 billion cost for 
keeping us troops there 
while the us spends more than 6 percent of its production on 
the military european nations spend far less and japan only 1 
percent he said 
the burden should be equalized and he wanted to get that one 
done in our first term he said 
taking questions from the group afterward bentsen said he 
supported some forgiveness of the international debt owed by mexico 
on a case by case basis and not as a nation as a whole mexico 
needed to be treated like a company that went bankrupt that pays 
part but not all on its obligations he said 
both banks and the us government may have to write off some of 
the debt he said the situation with other debtor nations would 
have to be reviewed individually he said 
bentsen planned to continue campaigning in california this 
morning and then return to his native texas where he will spend the 
bulk of the time remaining before the election

communist party chief zhao ziyang has warned that 
social stability and the partys ability to lead china are at stake 
in efforts to control inflation 
the government must see to it that inflation next year must be 
conspicuously lower than this year the official xinhua news 
agency on thursday quoted zhao as telling the partys policymaking 
central committee 
this is the touchstone by which we will test the partys and 
governments ability to lead and be in command of the situation 
zhao said in the speech 
the speech was delivered late last month at a crucial central 
committee meeting that decided to slash investment and spending and 
roll back price reforms in order to reduce inflation inflation is 
officially reported at 19 percent annually but analysts believed it 
to be twice that 
xinhua did not report the contents of the speech initially its 
belated report may have been intended to stem speculation that zhao 
lost prestige with the communist leadership because of his previous 
support for rapid reform and was not actively involved in setting 
the new slowdown policy 
xinhua did not provide a text but quoted zhao as strongly 
endorsing the measures to control inflation and overheated growth 
reassert central control over prices and distribution of key goods 
and punish widespread official corruption 
zhao said corruption has hurt the image of the party and 
government adding if this problem remains unsolved well lose 
the support of the people 
yearly inflation should be brought below 10 percent as should 
economic growth he said if this is not done he said social 
stability will be affected 
to us it may appear to be late in the day to only now realize 
the full extent of the problem and take action to settle it zhao 
said however it is still not too late and even more serious 
problems will follow if we continue to hesitate 
since the central committee adopted the new antiinflation anti 
corruption policy sept 30 the government has begun cancelling 
construction projects reorganizing or shutting down companies that 
made illegal business deals and reducing local governments 
autonomy in trade and pricesetting 
steps have been taken to discourage spending on luxuries and 
tighten bank credit policies 
zhao said in his speech that china cannot carry out its vision of 
a new economic system without price reform but he said supplies 
of staple foods and key industrial raw materials may be inadequate 
for a long time and must therefore remain under central state 
control to avoid pushing prices up 
he said reforms in enterprise management should be accelerated 
however and also called for increased efforts to privatize housing 
a major drain on municipal finances and sell shares in state 
enterprises 
at one point zhao seemed to confront the possibility feared by 
some western economists that chinas reform program will lose 
momentum and become stalled indefinitely 
the significance of the reform lies in what it has already 
accomplished he said its major importance has been in putting 
an end to the closed and stagnant situation china was in when it was 
begun

south koreas gross national product is 
expected to grow 11 percent this year instead of the 10 percent

123 percent in 1986 and 12 percent in 1987

third quarter from a year ago and was expected to grow 
substantially in the fourth quarter even if there is some slowdown 
in overall business activity the gnp grew 103 percent in the third 
quarter of 1987 
the gnp advanced 149 percent in the first quarter of this year 
but gained a lower 91 percent in the second quarter when many

bob hope said you never know wholl show up 
when you leave the porch light on in this case it was george bush 
bush and a lawnful of hollywoods senior celebrities 
the vice president promised to spare them the boredom of the 
issues and reminded them about the myth of martin van buren the 
last sitting vice president elected to the white house 
it wasnt just any lawn it was hopes in elegant toluca lake 
overlooking the private golf holes the swimming pool and hollywood 
hope spouted oneliners bush ventured one joke saying the 
85yearold comedian was the only one around who could remember van 
buren he was elected in 1836 
it cost 5000 a couple to take in the republican party at the 
hope compound thursday night and spend about 90 minutes with the 
vice president and mrs bush 
the celebrity list included a cast of movies out of the past 
esther williams glenn ford jane russell robert mitchum 
hope called the roll summoning them to a stage set up behind his 
vast home and the names kept coming 
among them telly savalas danny thomas pat boone phyllis 
diller tony martin gene autry ill tell you hope said of the 
aging hollywood cowboy if he makes it to the stage he gets 
decorated 
with bush and his wife at a ringside lawn table hope warmed up 
the crowd 
you leave your porch light on you never know whos going to 
show up he said looking down at the bushes 
these last few weeks theyve been making more public 
appearances than elvis 
these two have seen almost as many hotel rooms as jimmy 
swaggart 
hope said hed asked bush over because the vice president has 
been working for ronald reagan for eight years and i thought that 
now hed like to meet some real actors 
but hope said there had been inconveniences because of security 
he said the secret service arrived with bombsniffing dogs they 
stopped twice by my joke file 
hope said that in his second presidential debate bush did so 
much better than usual that theyre testing him for steroids 
after that debate in los angeles singer barbra streisand threw a 
reception for democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
bushs briefing paper on thursdays campaign events said the hope 
reception would offset the streisand affair 
the vice president said the gop fundraising reception was 
spectacular 
bob hope has agreed to be the head of our 51member seniors for 
bush coalition he then announced the audience laughed 
thats no joke hes heading it nationwide said bush 
and we picked him because some of you may remember the myth of 
martin van buren the last time a vice president was ever elected 
president of the united states and bob was the only one who could 
remember old martin 
im not going to bore you with the issues and all the 
campaign bush said when they say how do you feel i say

relatives of people killed in airline 
disasters receive less than half the compensation they should and 
the legal system gives the industry little incentive to improve 
safety a rand corp study concludes 
compensation in aviation cases is neither fair nor adequate 
said economist james p smith principal author of the study that 
surveyed claims and lawsuits involving 2228 deaths in 25 crashes 
involving us airlines between 1970 and 1984 
its not adequate in that people dont receive full 
compensation for their loss its not fair because people with 
identical losses receive very different amounts he said 
the study by rands institute for civil justice was criticized as 
misleading by trade associations for plane manufacturers and 
airlines which had paid onethird of its 13 million cost 
they said the study also overstates losses to victims survivors 
and plays down how government regulation promotes safety 
i dont think its reasonable to assume that carriers are 
flying aircraft they know are unsafe because they know their 
financial exposure isnt great enough to warrant additional 
care said leroy haugh vice president of the aerospace industries 
association 
but bill wagner president of the association of trial lawyers of 
america urged state legislatures to look at rands calculations 
to see if state laws should be reevaluated to more fairly 
compensate those who suffer losses 
the study found the most unfairly compensated survivors were 
those related to crash victims who were foreigners passengers on 
bigger jets wealthy people who would have had high future earnings 
and passengers with tickets for us airlines overseas flights or 
domestic legs of overseas flights 
the 1929 warsaw convention limits liabiity to 75000 for such 
treaty tickets 
rand found that in all airlines plane builders and government 
agencies paid 769 million compared with survivors 159 billion 
in true economic losses a projection of the amount they would have 
received from the victims future earnings 
on average surviving relatives of a crash victim got 363000 
only 49 percent of the survivors 749000 in true economic losses 
those losses exclude future earnings a crash victim would have spent 
on himself or herself 
defendants pay only part of survivors losses and never pay full 
economic losses so the legal system gives them little incentive to 
improve safety although such incentives come from government 
regulation and travelers tendencies to avoid airlines they believe 
unsafe smith said 
the study said that because some victims would have had very high 
earnings about half the compensation went to survivors of only 
onesixth of the victims survivors of the most affluent victims 
tended to get a much lower percentage than survivors of the least 
affluent victims relative to their monetary loss and survivors of 
professional women were undercompensated based on the future 
earnings of the average woman the study said 
haugh of the aerospace industries association said the study is 
misleading because it lumps domestic passengers with those covered 
by the 75000 liability limit 
we believe compensation in domestic accident cases has been 
adequate and is in fact many times higher than anywhere else in the 
world said air transport association spokesman bill jackman 
he said compensation has been inadequate for survivors of 
victims who carried treaty tickets and airlines support efforts to 
change the treaty so survivors can seek unlimited economic 
damages

michael dukakis has the support of more than half 
the democrats who previously voted for ronald reagan but george 
bush is still ahead by nine points overall according to an nbc 
newswall street journal poll 
the poll released thursday also found many voters dissatisfied 
with both majorparty candidates 
in the survey of 1285 likely voters conducted sunday through 
wednesday bush led dukakis 51 percent to 42 percent the lead by 
the republican vice president over massachusetts democratic 
governor was similar to the 5244 margin bush held in an 
abcwashington post poll conducted during the seven days ending 
tuesday 
those polls found a closer race than the 13 and 14point bush 
leads among likely voters in two polls over the weekend and 
considerably closer than the 17 points in an nbcjournal poll just 
after the oct 13 debate 
the survey found bush capturing the support of more than a third 
of the democrats who voted for president reagan in 1984 while 56 
percent went for dukakis and the two split bluecollar voters 
evenly 
only 35 percent in the nbcjournal poll said they were pleased 
with their choices and 61 percent said they wished others were 
running pollsters have said that unhappiness with the candidates 
and their relatively weak support could create continuing 
fluctuations in the race 
statewide polls in new york meanwhile indicate a close battle 
between bush and dukakis in that democratic bastion a missouri poll 
has found a close race in that state a colorado poll said bushs 
lead over dukakis has narrowed significantly as a result of a 
recent dukakis visit 
in new york the marist college institute for public opinion 
released a poll giving dukakis a 4743 lead the survey of 654 
likely new york voters had a margin of error of four points a new 
york post survey gave bush a 4644 lead but the fivepoint margin 
of error in the survey of 677 registered voters put the two 
candidates in a statistical dead heat 
a poll in the kansas city mo times showed bushs lead over 
dukakis narrowing from nine points in a previous survey to just one 
point the survey of 550 likely missouri voters showed bush with 44 
percent of the vote compared with 43 percent for dukakis the survey 
had a margin of error of plus or minus four points 
a denver postnewscenter 4 poll showed bush leading 50 percent to 
41 percent dukakis had been trailing bush by as much as 19 points 
no margin of error was available on the survey of 450 registered 
voters

the us space shuttle was never 
equipped for an unmanned test flight like the one planned tonight 
for the soviets lookalike orbiter at the time the program was 
behind schedule money was tight and the technology was not well 
developed 
nasa however says it had confidence that its design would work 
the first time when the shuttle columbia made its debut more than 
seven years ago 
despite the striking resemblance of the two spacecraft there are 
numerous other differences between them 
the soviet shuttles main engines will be on the energia rocket 
instead of on the reusable orbiter the craft has small jet engines 
that give it greater maneuverability for landing and it has 
liquidfuel booster rockets instead of solidfuel boosters like the 
one that destroyed challenger in january 1986 grounding the 
american program for 32 months 
the soviet union announced wednesday that its shuttle would be 
launched at 1123 pm edt today or 623 am moscow time saturday 
the shuttle is named buran russian for snowstorm 
soviet officials said burans first flight would be pilotless to 
avoid deaths in case of an accident like the challenger explosion 
the national aeronautics and space administration said its 
decision to have two astronauts pilot the first us shuttle 
reflected engineers confidence that it would work the first time 
but only if humans were aboard 
spacecraft in the earlier mercury gemini and apollo programs 
underwent extensive unmanned testing before men flew them 
but the shuttle program was running three years behind schedule 
and financial pressure on nasa was rising 
flying the shuttle without astronauts would have required 
extensive and expensive changes to allow the automatic pilot to 
respond to radio commands 
officials also noted that the american shuttle was built with the 
technology of the early 1970s when it would have been more 
difficult to develop an automated landing system for so complex a 
craft the soviets coming along a decade later could take 
advantage of the latest developments 
as a precaution the us shuttle included ejection seats for the 
two pilots who flew early shakedown missions but there was room for 
only two such devices and they were removed when crews expanded 
the soviet shuttle will be boosted into orbit by the new energia 
rocket which can lift a 220000pound payload that rivals the 
power of americas huge saturn 5 rocket which was scrapped for 
economy reasons after taking six apollo crews to the moon 
the liquidhydrogen liquidoxygen booster has had only one test 
flight in may 1987 the soviets called the test a success even 
though the payload failed to reach orbit several other technical 
problems cropped up during the flight and engineers worked for 
months to correct them 
the soviet shuttles main engines are attached to the energia 
meaning they will be jettisoned and cannot be reused on the us 
shuttle the main motors are part of the orbiter and can be reflown 
up to 55 times 
by not carrying its engines the soviet shuttle can haul more 
cargo than its us cousin about 66000 pounds compared with 55000 
pounds the disadvantage is that new expensive powerplants have to 
be built for each launch 
assisting the soviet craft into space are four strapon rockets 
also powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen the us vehicle 
has two solidfuel strapon motors 
after descending from orbit the american shuttle becomes a 
powerless glider if it were unable to reach its runway or if high 
crosswinds or something else spoiled its final approach the crew 
would have to bail out and leave the vehicle to crash 
the soviet crafts two small jet engines would enable it to make 
its final approach at a safer shallower angle and allow greater 
maneuverability including the possibility of a second landing 
attempt 
nasa considered using jet engines for landing but abandoned the 
idea because of cost weight and technical tradeoffs

an earthquake registering 50 on the richter scale 
shook the tokyo area today but there were no immediate reports of 
damage or casualties the central meteorological agency said the 
tremor was minor and was unlikely to trigger a tsunami or tidal 
wave 
the meteorological agency said the quakes epicenter was 50 miles 
under the sea off chiba southeast of tokyo shaking buildings in 
chiba and yokohama and to a lesser extent kofu utsunomiya choshi 
and mito in the tokyo metropolitan area 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means the ground motion is 
10 times greater 
a quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans a 
quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in populated 
areas and the highest a quake of magnitude 8 is a great 
earthquake capable of tremendous damage in populated areas

more than 2500 university of massachusetts 
students clasped hands in a milelong cordon against racism on the 
second anniversary of a racial clash that began as a fight between 
baseball fans but set off two years of unrest 
im so proud we did it said lori edmonds president of the 
afrikam society as she ran along the line of students thursday 
hugging friends with tears streaming down her cheeks 
atlanta mayor andrew young praised the hands across umass 
demonstration but said overcoming racism is not a oneday affair 
this atmosphere of civility has to be more than just holding 
hands with each other once a year he told 600 students in an 
evening speech 
ethnic insecurity is not something that you overcome just by 
getting educated he added urging students to make an effort to 
get to know others with different ethnic religious and geographic 
backgrounds 
the line of students most of them white stretched more than a 
mile diagonally across the campus in this western massachusetts 
town from dormitories on the northwest side to dormitories on the 
southwest 
it was in the southwest sector that fights broke out between 
black new york mets fans and white boston red sox boosters after the 
mets victory in the 1986 world series ten students were injured in 
the fracas which administrators blamed on underlying racial tension 
the incident was the first of a series of campus racial clashes 
in one students occupied a campus center for six days to draw 
attention to their demand that school officials discipline five 
white students accused of beating two black students 
chancellor joseph duffey said he had initially viewed hands 
across umass part of a campuswide civility day program with 
some uncertainty 
it was a bold and maybe a bit risky thing to do he said 
but the chancellor said he was pleased with the outcome it was 
a very moving event 
music professor horace boyer played we shall overcome on the 
campus carillon as the students spread out from the campus pond 
some sang as the bright autumn sun caught the flaming maples and 
oaks but most did not know the words to the song that stirred 
earlier generations of civil rights demonstrators 
so many things promote separatism and ethnicity on this campus 
and elsewhere that there comes a time when you need to look at the 
things we have in common duffey said as he stood between a black 
student and a white student 
jason rabinowitz copresident elect of the student government 
association said students both black and white remained skeptical 
about the affirmative action commitment of the 26000student state 
university that has a 25 percent black enrollment 
the administration made a number of promises in the wake of the 
hurst report on the world series fight and the occupation of new 
africa house a campus third world center last february but they 
have not followed through rabinowitz told a noontime rally 
students ended their occupation after administrators agreed to a 
number of concessions including increasing the number of minority 
students 
the programs for minority students they promised to increase 
have actually been cut rabinowitz said the renovations they 
promised to new africa house have not begun and the numbers of 
black students enrolled has not changed 
but rabinowitz praised civility day 
what it says about the umass community is that our campus is 
one that is overwhelmingly opposed to racism and people are willing 
to come together in fighting it

an 11yearold girl whose forehead was 
pierced by a lawn dart was in a medically induced coma today as a 
federal agency prepared to ban the potentially deadly toy 
amy herrin of mcminnville was in critical condition at vanderbilt 
university medical center as doctors waited for swelling in her 
brain to subside 
the consumer product safety commission planned to ban the 
manufacture and sale of lawn darts today agency spokesman dave 
shiflett said thursday 
im glad that they are going to do something and i know they 
will said amys mother sue tucker it is not a toy that you 
play with 
what were doing right now is hoping and praying she said 
amy was hurt as she played the horseshoelike game with a cousin 
outside a neighbors house in the central tennessee city on tuesday 
mrs tucker said the cousin raced into her kitchen followed by 
amy with the dart still protruding from her head 
she just said momma its in my head all else i remember is 
me screaming mrs tucker said 
a vanderbilt surgical team spent eight hours removing the dart 
which had penetrated two inches into amys head lawn darts have 
4inchlong metal points and weigh a pound 
drugs were used to put the girl in a coma out of concern that if 
her brain was functioning it would swell causing damage or death 
according to medical center spokesman wayne wood 
despite the coma there has been some swelling in the girls 
brain he said 
her brain sustained trauma wood said what damage to her 
faculties was and wasnt done we dont know 
amy faces more surgery said her stepfather lamar tucker 
last week congress passed legislation ordering the government to 
ban the sale of lawn darts which have been blamed for three 
childrens deaths and injuries to thousands of others 
federal law currently requires that the darts carry warning 
labels stating the game is not for children and can cause serious 
injury or death they are not to be sold in toy stores or in toy 
departments 
no toy could do the damage thats been done to my baby mrs 
tucker said 
the cousin who threw the dart was real tore up mrs tucker 
said he came down to the hospital with his mother and dad hes 
only 11 years old he brought amy flowers and a big balloon

charles hawtrey a stalwart of the carry on 
comedy film series that became a british institution has died in 
southeast england he was 73 
hawtrey died thursday at the windthorpe lodge nursing home at the 
seaside village of walmer 70 miles from london 
he had been suffering from an artery problem and the british 
domestic news agency press association said his death came a month 
after hawtrey refused to have his legs amputated to combat it 
hawtrey whose outrageously camp screen persona was once 
described by a movie critic as a thin wet hen in granny specs 
appeared in 23 of the 28 carry on films 
the series began in 1958 with carry on sergeant and carried 
on nearly two decades at a production rate of roughly two movies a 
year the films included carry on nurse carry on teacher 
carry on england and carry on emmanuelle 
spindlelegged and squawkyvoiced hawtrey popped up in one 
absurdly unlikely role after another as the series progressed 
the formula of bawdy slapstick old jokes sexual innuendo and 
outrageous doubleentendres rarely varied but proved hugely popular 
with undemanding british audiences intent on belly laughs 
the movies are often repeated on television 
born george frederick joffre hartree he came from a family with 
theatrical roots although his father was a motor mechanic 
he borrowed the name charles hawtrey from the celebrated 
actormanager sir charles hawtrey who died in 1923 he made his 
debut on the london stage in 1927 and in 1929 began a long career 
in radio comedy roles

a computer glitch gave a 21yearold 
student a rare chance to get rich quick but a spell of honesty 
stopped the man from withdrawing thousands of dollars from an 
instant cash machine 
although neil martin had not applied for money machine 
privileges two new cards arrived in the mail last week he tried 
one inappropriately named safecard and was amazed when the 
screen told him 99999999 was in his account 
the second card registered another 99999999 available for 
withdrawal 
the devry institute of technology student considered the 
situation overnight and returned to a machine thursday morning 
where he withdrew 10 from each account the balances did not change 
now dont make me out to be a criminal martin said i just 
think its so hilarious its such a blunder i cant believe it 
happened i never applied for these cards 
apparently martin was not the only home savings association 
customer who became an instant millionaire this week said jerry 
gentry a regional vice president of the savings and loan 
its just a little fluke gentry said 
home savings is merging with safety federal savings and loan 
association and a switch to a new computer system created the crazy 
account balance messages wednesday and thursday gentry said 
the firm will investigate the glitches he said 
martin tried to turn in the money thursday but a savings and 
loan official told him his real account would reflect the 
withdrawals

million and then knock it down to put up a 35 million house of 
course 
people think were a little crazy said developer charles 
bourque but he said that in the case of the property overlooking 
the 18th hole at the weston country club what hes doing makes good 
economic sense 
in july bourque and his father ulysse bourque who run fine 
homes inc of lexington bought a large colonialstyle house on 
three acres of land in this posh boston suburb 
bourque said the house was in disrepair so he razed it and is 
putting up an 11room georgian colonial which he plans to offer for 
35 million when it is completed in about five months 
there has been a lot of buzzing in town and people on the golf 
course are shaking their heads he said but he said the return on 
the investment made the project worthwhile

the nations leading testing organization has 
announced plans for a hightech teacher licensing test that would 
give schools a more comprehensive tool to judge the competence of 
beginning teachers 
the test as yet unnamed wont be available until 1992 but is 
eventually expected to replace the national teacher exam the 
multiplechoice test currently used as a licensing tool in 30 states 
and taken by some 200000 teacher candidates a year according to 
the educational testing service 
the new test will use computer simulations of classroom 
situations and other technologies expected to allow for more 
thorough evaluations of beginning teaching skills than 
paperandpencil tests said the lawrenceville nj testing 
organization 
teacher testing has been a thorny issue since a landmark federal 
report a nation at risk charged in 1983 that too few 
academically able students are being attracted to teaching 
as more states responded by turning to licensing tests to help 
weed out incompetents teacher unions objected that existing tests 
do not fairly assess classroom skills while others worried that 
disproportionate numbers of minority candidates were failing them 
there is a widespread and growing concern about the 
preparedness and effectiveness of beginning teachers and we believe 
that breakthroughs in research and technology make possible a new 
kind of assessment that will provide greater assistance fairness 
and accuracy said ets president gregory r anrig on thursday 
were trying to heed criticisms of the tests capitalize on 
advances in technology and give a way for students to demonstrate 
their strengths he said 
mary hatwood futrell president of the national education 
association the nations largest teachers union also applauded 
etss plans we are very pleased that they are calling for a 
multifaceted assessment she said adding she was pleased that 
the testing firm had sought the advice of teacher unions and other 
education groups 
carolyn trice associate director of educational issues for the 
american federation of teachers said that while the union isnt 
ready to endorse the new exam im glad to see this kind of test 
development 
the problem with paperandpencil tests is they just dont 
assess what teachers know when you get into human interaction and 
how you motivate students to learn a pencil and paper test cannot 
predict whether a teacher will be successful she said 
the new exam would evaluate teacher candidates at three different 
stages in their training the first test would use a computer to 
evaluate reading math and writing skills during or after the second 
year of undergraduate study the second would assess a candidates 
grasp of subject matter and teaching principles after completion of 
teacher training 
the final test would involve classroom observation and evaluation 
of teaching performance and would make use of computer simulations 
of classroom situations 
the evaluation may extend over a period of time for a 
prospective teacher giving states a much better sense of 
professional development said carol dwyer an ets senior 
development leader who created the test the method also allows 
the student to find out early whether he or she meets the 
prerequisites needed to teach while there is still time to improve 
or make other career plans

a soviet space shuttle that looks much like the 
us version is set for an unmanned test flight this weekend a 
belated soviet acknowledgement that a shuttle is a good idea after 
all 
the shuttle named buran russian for snowstorm is scheduled for 
launch at 623 am moscow time saturday 1123 pm edt friday 
from the baikonur cosmodrome on the central asian steppes of 
kazakhstan 
a soviet tv announcer has indicated the launch time could be 
pushed back because tests of systems may take longer than 
anticipated a tass dispatch late thursday from the launch site said 
final operations are under way 
for years the soviets wouldnt admit they were developing their 
own shuttle or chelnok even though western specialists date 
the program back to 1982 
in june 1980 10 months before the united states launched the 
columbia the chief of cosmonaut training said soviet officials 
consider that the employment of these spacecraft is not justified 
for soviet research because present tasks can be solved with the 
welltested methods in an economical way 
former cosmonaut konstantin p feoktistov writing in 1984 in a 
soviet newspaper praised the american shuttle as an impressive 
engineering achievement but he added this system is not sound 
economically and technologically 
soviet officials appeared to become believers after settling on a 
different focus for their shuttle than the one nasa chose 
the us shuttle was designed primarily to ferry satellites into 
orbit but alexander i dunayev the head of the soviet space agency 
glavkosmos said in 1987 that shuttles are not as economical as 
singleuse rocket boosters for placing satellites into orbit 
in the clearest hint of the soviet shuttles purpose he said 
such craft are valuable for servicing space stations and satellites 
and recovering objects from orbit 
the reasoning seems sound because ever since they pioneered space 
flight with the 1957 launch of sputnik the soviets have forged a 
proven track record for launching satellites on singleuse rockets 
they put up more than 150 satellites a year more than any other 
country 
in addition the soviets have concentrated on maintaining a 
permanent manned presence in space aboard the orbiting space station 
mir while soviet officials have not said whether the shuttle is 
capable of doing so the shuttle might be able to ferry supplies and 
cosmonauts to mir 
the soviets have repeatedly criticized the military use of the 
american shuttle and the next us flight of the atlantis 
scheduled for late november is a mission for the pentagon 
as with the american shuttle the soviets might use the buran for 
military missions the us defense department says the soviet 
shuttle could be used to deploy antisatellite and ballistic missile 
defense weapons 
soviet officials say the first flight of their shuttle was 
designed to be pilotless to avoid danger to cosmonauts they point 
to the jan 28 1986 explosion of the challenger when its crew of 
seven was killed as an example of the hazards they are trying to 
avoid 
it isnt clear whether the soviets will offer the shuttles 
services to foreign customers as they have done with their proton 
rocket boosters if foreign customers are sought competition will 
come not only from the united states but from western europe 
the buran clearly has advantages over its american cousin its 
separate booster rocket the energia is powered only by liquid 
fuels which can be extinguished in an emergency it has no 
solidfuel boosters like the one that failed on the challenger 
in addition the soviet shuttle can use jet engines in its tail 
giving it more maneuverability in landing than its american 
counterpart which can only glide onto a runway 
the buran can carry 66000 pounds of payload about 11000 more 
than the us shuttles payload capacity energia can hoist 100 tons 
while soviet officials maintain they did not copy the american 
shuttle the pentagon has a different view 
by using us propulsion computer materials and airframe 
technology and design the soviets were able to produce an orbiter 
years earlier and at far less cost than if they had depended 
solely on their own technology and engineering the defense 
department said in its 1988 report soviet military power

a 1 million check written by hustler magazine 
publisher larry flynt purportedly for the contract murders of 
singer frank sinatra and three publishers was really just a 
practical joke flynts lawyer says 
the allegations are totally unfounded flynts attorney alan 
isaacman said thursday back in november 1983 larry flynt had a 
dinner party and gave out as a joke milliondollar checks to about 
half a dozen people 
but los angeles county sheriff sherman block said he was taking 
the matter seriously 
ive been led to believe that larry flynt has a propensity to 
try to harm people he sees as his enemies whether over business 
arrangements or whatever block said wednesday 
no charges have been filed sheriffs capt robert grimm said an 
investigation is continuing 
authorities allege flynt wrote the check on nov 14 1983 to 
mitchel l werbell for the slaying of sinatra playboy publisher 
hugh m hefner penthouse publisher robert guccione and former tv 
guide publisher and us ambassador walter annenberg 
i think he was just a little crazy said guccione who added 
he does take the threat seriously it was a very irrational act 
because neither hefner nor i compete with his magazine and if 
you factor in annenberg and sinatra it becomes even more 
irrational for me i just put it down to flynts obvious dislike 
for me 
said hefner when youre a celebrity and controversial you 
wind up on one of those crazy lists with reagan sinatra and the 
pope 
sinatras publicist susan reynolds said the entertainer had no 
comment 
a secretary at annenbergs radnor pa office said he was 
unavailable for comment as did a member of annenbergs house staff 
who answered the telephone at his rancho mirage estate neither 
woman would give her name 
this period of flynts life was described as a painful period 
when he was using narcotics grimm said 
isaacman acknowledged flynts druginduced behavior during the 
fall of 1983 but said the kinds of things he said then had 
nothing to do with harming other people 
werbell head of a georgia private security center called sionics 
inc was among those who received a check at the party said 
isaacman and there wasnt any talk of killing anyone that was 
someone elses idea 
werbell described himself as a retired lieutenant general in the 
royal free afghan army a soldier of fortune former international 
arms dealer and onetime counterterrorism school operator he had a 
security consultant business and flynt was one of his clients 
we never heard anything about this check being paid to kill 
anybody until wednesday afternoon isaacman said 
he said none of the guests tried to cash their checks including 
werbell he said it was found by werbells sons after his death in 
december 1983 and they tried to cash it in february 1984 it had 
been canceled by then 
the sons sued flynt in a georgia court to get the money and 
isaacman said the case was thrown out the check was preserved as 
part of the court record he said 
grimm said information about the alleged plot turned up recently 
in the investigation of the 1983 murderforhire slaying of new york 
theater producer roy radin whom authorities said was embroiled in a 
soured finance deal for the movie the cotton club

the launch of an ariane 2 rocket was 
judged a success as it lifted into orbit a powerful television 
satellite that heralds a new era of french broadcasting 
the satellite lifted off without a hitch into clear skies late 
thursday above the european space agency launch site on the 
northeastern edge of south america 
it was the 13th successful launch in 13 months for arianespace 
responsible for the european space agencys commercial launches 
the satellite reached orbit about 16 minutes after takeoff and 
quickly separated from the rocket 
about 25 minutes after liftoff the solar panels opened on the 
satellite it was the stage that had most concerned technicians 
after the failure last year of the west german tvsat1 satellite 
for a reason that has yet to be determined the panels failed to 
open on the west german satellite a sister to the french satellite 
under the joint frenchgerman agreement that was the origin of the 
satellite project in 1977 
officials at the space center described the launch as a 
complete success 
the fivechannel french satellite will beam television shows 
directly to the home previously satellite signals were picked up 
by large dishes owned by cable companies and networks that relayed 
programming to viewers 
the satellite which will be operational by late december has a 
lifespan of eight years and will sit in geostationary orbit 22000 
miles above the atlantic ocean 
its signal will reach viewers from portugal to the ural mountains 
of the soviet union and from britain to north africa bringing 
viewers with receiving equipment a better tv picture and stereo 
sound tdf1 is the first step for europe toward the new technology 
of highdefinition television 
it was designed by the french broadcasting authority to bring an 
increased number of television channels to 66 million 
frenchspeaking viewers in france belgium switzerland luxembourg 
monaco and a potential audience of 400 million viewers in north 
africa 
simone veil a member of the european parliament and president of 
the european year of cinema and television called the launch a 
formidable success 
in a message to the head of frances broadcasting authority mrs 
veil said the satellite turns a new page in the history of 
television in europe 
critics have said the satellite developed over a decade at a 
cost of about 250 million is overpriced and already outmoded 
since the satellite was designed advances in technology have put 
it at a competitive disadvantage against five other satellite 
ventures scheduled to begin operation before 1990 
only one of the five channels had been rented officially at the 
time of liftoff by the french cultural network la sept for arts 
programming 
industry sources said two more channels were likely to be taken 
by the highly successful cable movie channel canal plus to transmit 
family programming and germanlanguage feature films 
another transponder might be used to broadcast reruns mostly of 
american television comedies by the private french network tf1 
to answer the competition the french government decided in the 
weeks before liftoff to further subsidize the cost of leasing 
channels to operators instead of costing 20 million to 22 
million the french satellite will now cost about the same as its 
competitor astra which leases channels for 6 million to 7 million 
astra a mediumpower 16channel satellite initiated by the 
luxembourg government is scheduled for launch dec 9 aboard an 
ariane rocket it has already leased most of its channels 
for the moment only 50000 satellite dishes exist in all of 
europe and the equipment for receiving signals from the new french 
satellite is more expensive than that of the competition 
the french government will be watching the new satellite venture 
with particular concern because it has a second 250 million 
satellite scheduled for launch next year as a backup to this one

a projected 55 millionplus lottery 
prize that would return the north american title for big jackpots to 
the state is making californians gambling fever rise again 
lottery officials and merchants said ticket sales for the 
saturday drawing were running about double the usual pace for 
thursdays sales 
the official estimate of over 55 million for the drawing is 
conservative based on similar situations in the twoyear history of 
californias computerized lotto 649 game said lottery spokesman 
bob taylor 
on june 4 californias lottery paid out a 514 million jackpot 
north americas largest at the time that jackpot was eclipsed sept 
3 by a 551 million prize in florida 
the staterun lotterys policy is to estimate the jackpot 
conservatively then revise the projection upward as sales soar 
it all depends on how wildly californians react to the 
1in14million chance of winning the jackpot 
the jackpot is going to generate an awful lot of sales said 
taylor 
the size of the jackpot depends on sales and jackpot rollovers 
which combine to produce heavy gambling periods dubbed 
lottomania when they first struck other states games 
when nobody picks all six winning numbers out of a choice 49 the 
jackpot is rolled over or added to the top prize for the next 
twiceweekly drawing 
four rollovers including the rollover of a 334 million jackpot 
wednesday night produced the current record prize estimate 
the exact size of the jackpot will depend on how many tickets are 
sold of every 1 ticket 20 cents goes into the jackpot 
each time the jackpot climbs so do sales pushing the total 
still higher generating even more sales historically most of the 
sales occur in the last few hours before the televised drawing at 
four seconds before 757 pm sales are cut off at 745 pm 
by 2 pm thursday sales hit 12 million which is normally the 
total for the entire 7 am to 10 pm sales period on a thursday 
said taylor

members of a private aid network for the nicaraguan 
rebels regularly briefed the fbi and military intelligence about 
their activities while allegedly violating the us neutrality act 
government reports show 
seven of the men were indicted by a fort lauderdale grand jury in 
june for violating the neutrality act by supplying mercenaries and 
guns to the rebel contras in 1984 and 1985 but they have challenged 
the federal indictment saying they were working closely with the 
reagan administration 
fbi and defense intelligence agency documents submitted by the 
defense confirm that at least two of the indicted network members 
thomas posey head of the contrasupporting group called civilian 
materiel assistance and his miami coordinator jose coutin were 
regularly reporting to government officials at various levels 
including the national security council 
the documents show the fbi knew the fbi was sharing the 
information with oliver north at the national security council 
said attorney john mattes who represents codefendant jack terrell 
at one point posey was calling the national security council from 
the miami fbi office the fbi acquiesced in all this conduct 
north a former national security council officer and retired 
marine lieutentant colonel has been charged with conspiring to 
defraud the government by illegally diverting proceeds from arms 
sales to iran to a criminal enterprise that financed the 
contras no date has been set for his trial 
miami fbi spokesman paul miller said thursday he could not 
comment on his agencys reports because the matter is before the 
courts 
a declassified report from military intelligence agent franklin 
camper showed his agency not only knew of the activities in april 
1984 but outlined for posey and a contra official a plan for raids 
into nicaragua by us volunteers and nicaraguan rebels one plan 
was to blow up a dam at a hydroelectric plant leaving much of 
nicaragua without power 
a january 1985 miami fbi report showed that larry spivey a 
wellconnected film producer who was working and traveling with 
posey called the fbi to tell them about the networks plans 
posey terrell and possibly coutin were getting ready to travel 
to costa rica to take part in some type of major military action 
against nicaragua the fbi report stated 
in all spivey coutin and posey talked to fbi agents in miami 
birmingham and los angeles at least 10 times in janauary 1985 and 
posey also spoke to agents in new orleans 
one fbi report quotes posey as warning an agent that month that 
all hell is going to break loose in central america in february 
the documents also show miami police informed the bureau in 
september 1984 of the networks existence and that drugtrafficking 
money was being used to finance the contra cause 
the miami fbi in turn directed the police and its own reports to 
north at the request of fbi headquarters in washington according to 
the bureau documents 
even as posey talked to the fbi about his activities it was 
clear both he and the bureau were aware the network might violate 
the us neutrality act which bars launching military activities 
against a government with which the nation is at peace 
the fbi even titled its internal memos on posey and coutin 
neutrality matters nicaragua 
the other defendants are mario calero brother of contra leader 
adolfo calero maco stewart and alex martinez the declassified 
documents mentioned the three in passing but they apparently did 
not brief the fbi or other governmental agencies 
the seventh defendant joe adams previously pleaded guilty to 
the neutrality act charges and was given one days probation by 
us district judge norman roettger

thousands of physicians at an 
international convention have called on a french company to resume 
making an abortion pill or pass the patent onto another manufacturer 
roussel uclaf the company making ru 486 suspended production 
wednesday after groups threatened to boycott company products but 
said thursday it may eventually distribute the drug once the outcry 
dies down 
many of the 9000 doctors and researchers at the weeklong world 
congress of gynecology and obstetrics in rio de janeiro signed a 
petition demanding roussel uclaf allow another company to produce 
the drug 
we are calling for health workers and doctors worldwide to 
mobilize forces to demand the drug be taken from the drawer said 
etienne emile baulieu the professor who played a major role in 
developing the pill the suspension is a serious blow to womens 
health 
social groups scientists and politicians have criticized the 
decision by roussel uclaf to suspend production 
antiabortion groups including the roman catholic church hailed 
it foes of ru 486 say it puts abortions at womens fingertips 
making abortion an easy form of contraception 
in france the drug can be taken only under medical supervision 
company officials in paris said when they announced their 
decision to suspend production that they were reacting to 
international outcry against sale of the drug 
we could resume distribution if the atmosphere returns to 
normal pierre joly vice president of roussel uclaf said on 
french radio thursday 
baulieu told the associated press roussel uclaf has taken a 
moralistic decision there is absolutely no medical basis for the 
suspension which comes despite the approval of the drug by both the 
french and chinese governments in terms of safety and efficacy 
the company is bowing to pressure from church groups and 
conservative sectors of society he added 
andre ulmann the ru 486 development chief told a news 
conference in rio that production was suspended to avoid a 
threatened international boycott of company products 
joly said the company acted because it was worried the antidrug 
climate might lead a woman under treatment to stop taking the drug 
and risk birth defects the company says the drug does tend to cause 
such defects if it fails 
sheldon segal director of population sciences at the usbased 
rockefeller foundation said in rio more than 500000 women die 
each year as a result of pregnancy more than 150000 of those 
after a dangerous surgical abortion 
women can take ru 486 also known as mifepristone for up to 49 
days after conception more than 100 clinics and hospitals in france 
were using the drug and it was undergoing testing for use in china 
and india 
it was shown to effectively terminate pregnancy in 95 percent of 
cases and started being used last month on a limited basis it also 
was being tested for such therapeutic purposes as treatment of 
uterine cancer 
ru 486 an antihormone blocks the action of progesterone the 
hormone essential to pregnancy reasearchers say it is highly 
effective particularly when used with a second product called 
sulprotone or prostaglandine e 
roussel uclaf is part of the giant west german chemical group 
hoescht the french government owns a 36 percent share

the sister of terry anderson saying it is ok 
to cut a deal called on the united states to make concessions 
that could free the longest held hostage and others abducted in 
lebanon 
peggy say speaking at one of several ceremonies to mark 
andersons 41st birthday thursday his fourth as a hostage also 
said reporters should not look for impropriety in negotiations to 
free hostages 
i am not saying give in to their demands i am saying 
engage in dialogue said mrs say iran offered us a deal 
they said release our frozen assets and we will use our influence 
to bring your hostages home we turned our back on it we cannot 
afford to do that 
mrs say and journalists met with un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar who condemned the hostages captors as 
perpetrators of a crime against humanity 
he did say he had some hope that something might develop before 
christmas maybe one maybe two hostages he did not go into it but 
he said he was hopeful said david aikman of the journalists 
committee to free terry anderson 
mrs say of cadiz ky told reporters at a news conference 
send the message to this administration that it is ok to cut a 
deal never has a hostage been freed without concessions being 
made 
the reagan administration repeatedly has said it will not 
negotiate with those holding the hostages it says that making deals 
with captors only encourages further hostagetaking 
at the news conference a postersize birthday card was unveiled 
it was drawn by garry trudeau andersons favorite cartoonist and 
was signed by more than 1000 journalists from 30 organizations 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated

held the longest of the 14 foreign hostages abducted in lebanon 
i watched with desperation the coming of his birthdays as a 
hostage freed french journalist jeanpaul kauffmann said through 
an interpreter at the news conference we ask today whether terry 
even is aware that it is his birthday 
you should know that at this moment as i speak to you terry 
is in chains his eyes are blindfolded he doesnt see the sun or 
the light of day terry suffers physically the most terrible 
thing though for him and i can tell you this because i was also a 
hostage is the feeling of having been abandoned and i think he 
is right said kauffmann

a former hostage the rev lawrence jenco collected birthday 
cards for anderson from children in westminster calif a los

publicizing the plight of the hostages so they will be freed 
she said the presidential candidates have an unwritten 
agreement that andersons captivity not become an issue im 
afraid the election will come and go and terry will still be 
there she said 
kauffmann told the luncheon group that constant coverage by the 
french press and public opinion caused the french government to seek 
his release

two marine helicopters that crashed at night 
killing 10 servicemen apparently collided less than 200 feet above 
the arizona desert officials said 
the boeing ch46 and bell uh1n helicopters were on a training 
mission when the crash occurred tuesday a memorial service for the 
nine marines and one air force officer killed was set for this 
afternoon at the chapel of the marine corps air station here 
investigators continued searching thursday for clues in the 
crash said 1st lt mary baldwin a marine spokeswoman she said she 
was unsure how long it would take to complete the investigation 
we feel confident enough to say a midair collision was more 
than likely said gunnery sgt hal wheeler a spokesman at the air 
station 
at the time of the accident the ch46 which was stationed at 
the marine corps air station in new river nc and the uh1n out 
of camp pendleton calif were taking part in a training exercise 
both were from 100 to 200 feet off the ground at the time of the 
accident officials said 
the pilots were wearing nightvision goggles maj gen donald 
ep miller 3rd marine aircraft wing commander at the marine corps 
air station in el toro calif said in a statement read by baldwin 
the statement did not say whether the goggles contributed to the 
crash 
efforts to recover the bodies were hampered by the rough terrain 
around the crash site at the foot of mountains on the goldwater air 
force range about 125 miles east of the yuma base 
the remote desert area is accessible only by fourwheel drive 
vehicles or helicopter and the last body was not recovered until 
wednesday afternoon baldwin said 
the exercise culminated a sevenweek weaponsandtactics 
instructors course taught twice a year at the yuma base 
the crash was the second in the instructor courses history in 
1984 two marines were killed when their light observation plane 
crashed on the range 
the twinrotor ch46 sea knight built by boeing until 1971 is 
the marines main assault helicopter and has been involved in 
several fatal crashes over the past few years 
tuesdays crash was the second in as many days involving military 
helicopters in the southwest 
on monday a uh1h helicopter hit a power line and crashed near 
the usmexico border in california killing five lawmen and three 
national guardsmen during the first mission of a joint antidrug

bail for imelda marcos must be set quickly to 
ensure that she and her husband do not try to flee the country a 
federal prosecutor says 
assistant us attorney charles labella argued thursday that the 
wife of the former philippines president ferdinand marcos be 
brought to new york for arraignment on racketeering charges 
labella made his pitch when us district judge john f keenan 
agreed to delay her husbands arraignment after defense lawyers 
presented letters from three doctors saying marcos was too ill to 
travel the 5000 miles from the couples hawaii home 
in a related development a newspaper reported today that federal 
agents have obtained an arrest warrant for saudian arabian financier 
adnan khashoggi 
khashoggi who was indicted last week on racketeering charges 
along with the marcoses is accused of acting as a front for marcos 
to help divert assets and hide marcos ownership of real estate and 
valuable art 
the los angeles times citing unidentified sources said 
officials believe khashoggi wont surrender to face the charges it 
said the warrant was issued in an effort to find khashoggi before he 
relocates to a country without formal extradition agreements with 
the united states 
in new york keenan agreed with prosecutors that the physicians 
letters left out important details but said he would delay marcos 
arraignment until a government physician could examine him or review 
his medical records 
but the judge refused to delay the arraignment of mrs marcos 
who was indicted with her husband and eight others for an alleged 
scheme that looted the philippines of more than 100 million 
mrs marcos was ordered to appear monday before keenan who said 
he would allow her to return to hawaii after setting bail 
despite pleas from marcos attorney richard a hibey about the 
expected circus atmosphere outside manhattans federal 
courthouse and the lengthy flight to new york from honolulu keenan 
said if the defendant was in new jersey the defendant comes to 
new york to be arraigned hawaii is an american state i dont see 
any reason why she cant be arraigned here in new york 
labella opposed a honolulu arraignment claiming the fbi was 
having difficulties keeping tabs on the couple who are under 
24hour surveillance at their honolulu compound 
he said the marcos entourage has done things to neutralize the 
surveillance they have collected five or six or seven cars inside 
the compound and released them at once many of them with smoked 
glass 
its the governments position that bail conditions must be set 
at least for one of the defendants quickly so we can pull off this 
surveillance and be sure the marcoses will remain in the united 
states pending these criminal proceedings 
hibey scoffed at the idea that the marcoses might flee noting 
that they are barred even from leaving the island of oahu and that 
the fbi has never lost sight of them 
neither marcos nor his wife issued any comments but a marcos 
attorney in honolulu said mrs marcos will appear on monday the 
courts decision is not without precedent the state of his health 
is definitely an issue that will come up again 
the defense sought to have both marcos 71 and his 59yearold 
wife arraigned at federal court in honolulu where they have lived 
since fleeing the philippines in february 1986 
they presented letters from two honolulu doctors and marcos 
personal physician saying marcos suffered from an enlarged heart 
and a thickening of the heart muscle 
prosecutors opposed the move saying the letters were too vague 
the letters reviewed for prosecutors by dr francis weld a 
cardiologist at columbiapresbyterian medical center did not 
indicate an inability to fly from hawaii to new york said 
labella 
mrs marcos will leave honolulu on saturday night for new york 
aboard a private luxury jet loaned by tobacco heiress doris duke 
74 who owns a honolulu mansion according to an aide to her husband

parents of police cadets at a training 
academy where 16 trainees were hospitalized last month told of 
alleged mistreatment at the hands of academy instructors 
one cadets mother said her sons arms swelled like popeyes 
after a day of training at the agawam academy she was among the 100 
people who packed a hearing thursday on police training methods 
held by a panel of 21 law enforcement and medical experts appointed 
by gov michael s dukakis 
the review of training procedures was ordered after nearly a 
third of the 50 cadets at the western massachusetts academy became 
ill after one day of training sept 19 one cadet required a liver 
transplant and was in a coma for two weeks the rest suffered from 
kidney problems dehydration and exhaustion 
cadets reported undergoing 10 hours of pushups laps and other 
exercise while only being allowed to drink a few cups of water 
no one can convince me that our officers are in any more 
control of a situation because of how many pushups they can do or 
whether they can take being called a wimp or a sow north adams 
mayor john barrett iii testified at the hearing three north adams 
cadets were among the rookies hospitalized 
cadet timothy shepard of pittsfield remained in serious condition 
thursday at a pittsburgh hospital where he underwent a liver 
transplant last month he collapsed from heat stroke during the 
training 
michael purcell a former army helicopter gunner dropped out of 
the academy after the first day his mother elizabeth said before 
the hearing that his arms swelled like popeyes after the 
training 
she criticized rules of the panel that barred any discussion of 
training at agawam last month the panel has agreed not to probe the 
subject which is under investigation by the state attorney general 
and to concentrate instead on statewide training policies 
who are they kidding in their minds the agawam academy is 
going to stay the way it is she said 
joseph lemay who retired from the chicopee police force after 36 
years testified that his daughter was forced to resign after her 
fourth week at the academy in 1987 
from the day she got in they wanted her to resign because she 
was a little slow in her running he said when they realized 
they couldnt break her they told her they would kick her out they 
made her resign 
he said the program forced 16 cadets in his daughters class to 
drop out 
colleen griswold an amherst police officer who attended an 
agawam academy class last winter said the training was tough but 
necessary she said instructors were fair although some women and 
minorities who failed the course have filed suit alleging 
discrimination 
i did not feel discrimination against me nor did hispanics in 
my class feel discrimination she testified our trainers did 
the best they could with what was available 
the state has provided training for municipal police since 1984 
under the massachusetts criminal justice training council which is 
run by a 24member board of law enforcement and appointed officials 
the hearing opened a day after the director of the embattled 
council took a leave of absence saying the agency has been hampered 
by the spotlight put on him since the agawam incident the academy 
has been closed since sept 21

a group of suspected palestinian 
terrorists arrested this week in west germany planned an attack in 
another country security sources said today 
west german authorities arrested 13 palestinians in raids in 
several west german cities on wednesday and thursday and seized a 
large quantity of explosives detonating devices and heavycaliber 
weapons 
there were so many weapons you could arm an army one 
security source said 
security sources speaking on the condition of anonymity 
declined to specify the target of the planned attack 
the sources said three of the suspects arrived in west germany 
from a foreign country while the other 10 lived in west germany 
one man came to west germany from damascus at the beginning of 
the year while the other two arrived the past two weeks the 
sources declined to specify where the other two men came from 
the sources said the suspects had been under police surveillance 
for some time 
we had them under control one source said 
the arrested men were believed to be from the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command a syriancontroled 
faction opposed to palestine liberation organization leader yasser 
arafat 
the faction is headed by ahmad jibril a former syrian army 
captain 
western and middle east intelligence reports say the groups 
fighters have been leased to the syrian and libyan secret services 
in the past to carry out assasinations and bombings 
the most spectacular action by the group came last november when 
three guerrillas flying motorized hanggliders infiltrated into 
israel across the lebanese border and clashed with israeli soldiers 
six israeli soldiers died and seven were wounded before the three 
guerrillas were also killed 
security sources in germany declined to give any details about 
the arrested men they said some of the suspects may be released 
today for lack of firm evidence but that the three suspected 
ringleaders who had arrived from abroad would be kept in custody 
jochen ruhland chief prosecutor in duesseldorf said the 13 
palestinians were arrested in raids throughout the country wednesday 
and thursday 
he said police searched 16 apartments and offices in west berlin 
hamburg frankfurt and neuss just outside duesseldorf and seized 
explosives detonators and incriminating documents 
west german authorities previously had said they were concerned 
about possible terrorist attacks linked to the frankfurt trial of 
confessed twa hijacker mohammed ali hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem 
however ruhland told the associated press that we have no 
clues of any possible connection between the arrested palestinians 
and hamadi 
a frankfurt judicial official also speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said authorities recently circulated warnings about plans 
for an imminent strike by palestinian terrorists

alzheimers disease malnutrition and 
dehydration caused the death of famed polar explorer richard e 
byrds son whose body was found in a warehouse the states medical 
examiner says 
the body of richard e byrd jr 68 was found oct 3 but wasnt 
immediately identified 
an autopsy determined that byrd died of malnutrition and 
dehydration contributed to by an underlying degenerative brain 
disease alzheimers chief medical examiner john e smialek

victims of memory and other intellectual powers its cause is 
unknown and there is no cure

missingperson report with police in needham mass 
smialek said byrds family had been unable to understand what 
happened to byrd after they put him aboard the train to boston and 
were relieved to learn the cause 
he was thought to be eccentric but not in terms of actual 
organic brain disease smialek said i dont think they 
suspected that 
byrds family told police he had some memory difficulties and 
sometimes became confused but had never wandered away 
smialek said alzheimers led byrd to wander after getting off the 
train in baltimore 
in his confused state he could have appeared to be 
intoxicated the medical examiner said he wasnt able to seek 
help

prime minister yitzhak shamir said today peace 
talks with the palestinians would be impossible without arab 
countries playing a role and that egypt and jordan eventually would 
have to join in such negotiations 
but the rightwing likud party leader rejected an international 
peace conference proposed by his chief rival in next tuesdays 
parliamentary elections foreign minister and labor party leader 
shimon peres 
in an interview with the associated press shamir said he backed 
us help in the middle east peace process but opposed participation 
by the soviets or the united nations 
shamir insisted any move toward peace would have to come under 
the ussponsored camp david accords signed in 1979 and would have 
to include egypt and jordan 
i cannot imagine any agreement with the palestinians without 
the help of some arab countries shamir said in his office in 
israels knesset or parliament 
i am repeating my demand to resume negotiations about 
implementation of the camp david agreement especially autonomy 
for the palestinians he said 
the 73yearold prime minister wearing a gray suit was relaxed 
and smiling throughout the halfhour interview 
he repeated his objections to an international middle east peace 
conference supported by peres he said if his likud bloc is elected 
egypt and jordan would see it as a sign that israels people reject 
a peres proposed international conference 
therefore the chances of resuming negotiations in the 
framework of camp david will reemerge he said 
shamir also noted however that he has done everything possible 
to implement the camp david agreement which calls for limited 
palestinian autonomy with their final status to be worked out later 
he said he did not expect egypt and jordan to move quickly toward 
talks even if likud is elected 
there is a necessity for patience and perseverance in the 
efforts to convince potential partners to change their minds and 
accept our proposals he said 
shamir defined the camp david accords as calling for negotiations 
between israel and representatives of jordan egypt and responsible 
palestinians from within the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
captured from the neighboring arab nations in 1967 
in a second stage shamir said elections would be held for a 
palestinian administrative council representing the arabs in the 
occupied lands in talks about the future of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
asked about his initial opposition to the egyptianisraeli peace 
agreement shamir said he had feared it would set a precedent of 
returning to pre1967 borders and destroying jewish settlements in 
the thenoccupied sinai 
in the campaign he has promised to expand such settlements in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip and vowed not to return any 
territory to arab control 
calling the united states more than a friend of israel 
shamir said he would welcome a us role in arranging negotiations 
between his government and the arabs 
we cannot say the same about the united nations he said 
the un represents a permanent antiisraeli majority 
asked about a soviet role he replied that the soviet union has 
played a negative role in the middle east 
the soviet union has a very strong antiisraeli position 
regarding our conflict with the arab world he said 
shamir refused to give details about what he would do to end the 
intefadeh the uprising in the occupied lands that led to more 
than 300 deaths since it erupted dec 8 
he said he could not rule out the use of greater force but 
admitted force could spur more resistance

an oppposition spokesman today denied 
government allegations that the solidarity trade union federation is 
hampering talks between polish officials and solidarity leaders 
government spokesman jerzy urban said late thursday that 
solidarity set preconditions to the talks by refusing to drop two 
members of its negotiating team members the government says do not 
respect polands constitutional order 
the two are adam michnik and jacek kuron solidarity advisers and 
government critics 
urban said solidarity was trying to blame the government for the 
delay in the start of talks but that it was not possible to reach 
agreement with activists of a confrontational orientation who aim 
to destabilize the state 
his statement was carried by the official pap news agency 
opposition mediator andrzej stelmachowski responded it is not 
our side which has the stiff position 
today it practically looks like a breakdown but lech walesa 
has not closed the door and the affair is open stelmachowski 
said the ball is on the other side now 
walesa the solidarity leader said he will not drop michnik and 
kuron from the solidarity delegation because he said it would set a 
precedent 
i see a lack of political will to solve the problems that 
divide us walesa said 
in addition to the governments objections to michnik and kuron 
walesa complained about the dismissals of at least 100 miners in 
silesia who took part in august strikes and had been promised job 
security 
he refused a government demand that he meet with interior 
minister gen czeslaw kiszczak to clear up final obstacles to the 
start of the talks on political social and economic reform 
the government said the talks have begun today if walesa agreed 
to meet kiszczak 
the talks were originally proposed in august during polands 
worst wave of labor unrest in seven years 
walesa agreed aug 31 to join kiszczak in talks after being 
guaranteed that they could include the topic of the future of 
solidarity as well as broader issues of political and economic 
reform 
solidarity was suppressed in a december 1981 military crackdown 
and was outlawed the next fall

a pennsylvania couple who want genetic 
testing of a girl they believe is their daughter will get a chance 
to present their case to a judge on nov 4 
sarasota circuit judge andy owen said thursday he would hear the 
petition of regina and ernest twigg of langhorne pa who want the 
sophisticated blood test to determine parentage of kimberly michell 
mays 9 
the child is at the core of a developing battle between the 
twiggs and robert mays a 43yearold sarasota roofing supply 
salesman who has raised the fourthgrader as his daughter 
the twiggs allege that their newborn was swapped with a sickly 
infant at a central florida hospital in 1978 in a babyselling 
scheme they think their baby was given to mays the child they took 
home from the hospital arlena died of a heart defect in august 
after genetic testing that revealed she could not have been their 
biological daughter 
mays opposes testing he says the twiggs base their claim on 
speculation and have offered no proof that the child he loves and 
raised is theirs 
he vows to fight any effort to take kimberly no matter what any 
genetic test might show 
the twiggs are prepared to push ahead with a legal custody battle 
if necessary their clearwater attorney john blakely said 
if kimberly is their daughter they do not know of any fact at 
this time that would cause them not to pursue custody of their 
child blakely said they are simply driven by their natural 
paternal and maternal instincts to pursue and protect their own 
offspring

the pilot of delta flight 191 was flying 
illegally when his jetliner crashed during a thunderstorm at 
dallasfort worth international airport killing 137 people a 
federal offical said 
the medical certification of capt edward m connors was invalid 
because the pilot failed to list prescription drugs and hospital 
stays on his application for certification audie w davis a 
federal aviation administration medical certification officer 
testified thursday 
delta air lines attorneys contend the testimony about connors 
use of prescription drugs is useless because the copilot who also 
was killed was at the controls when the plane crashed attempting to 
land during a 1985 thunderstorm 
the applications are submitted after pilots take required 
physical examinations at sixmonth intervals davis said 
his testimony came in a nonjury trial of a lawsuit filed by 
delta against the government the airline claims government 
employees such as air traffic controller and weather forecasters 
did not notify the crew of the doomed airliner that a severe 
thunderstorm was located in their landing path 
davis manager of the aeromedical certification branch of the faa 
in oklahoma city spent two days on the witness stand 
connors failed to fully disclose on his application that he had 
been treated at two fort worth hospitals and that he had been 
prescribed drugs such as the tranquilizer stelazine and the muscle 
relaxer robaxin and other antihistamines antibiotics and 
decongestants davis said 
the general problem with the drugs is how they affect general 
alertness davis said they could cause drowsiness or 
dizziness 
the government is introducing the medical testimony in an attempt 
to show that connors could have made errors in judgment and was 
medically unfit to fly 
three doctors testified earlier this week that they did not think 
the dosage of stelazine they prescribed for connors was strong 
enough to affect his flying performance 
us district judge david o belew recessed the trial until 
tuesday

round in his legal battle with a deli owner over profits generated 
by newmans salad dressing 
a state appellate court on thursday refused to dismiss julius 
golds lawsuit against newman writer ae hotchner and food broker 
david kalman 
gold claims in the lawsuit that the three men reneged on a 
promise to share with him the profits from newmans own salad 
dressing and several other food items 
gold says he helped develop and market the dressing and was 
promised 8 percent ownership of two corporations started from the 
food ventures 
a trial ended in mistrial june 23 because jurors had 
inadvertently been given material ruled inadmissible a second trial 
is scheduled for next week in bridgeport superior court 
newman who lives in westport contends he developed the dressing 
in his home then decided to sell it with hotchner with the profits 
going to charity they later expanded and began selling popcorn 
lemonade and spaghetti sauce under newmans name 
golds lawyer richard albrecht said gold has offered to give up 
any stock he believes he is owed in exchange for a settlement which 
would go to a taxfree charitable foundation 
he wants the power of selecting which charities the money goes 
to rather than leaving that decision to newman albrecht said

capital and expansion of private initiatives 
in his interview splashed over two pages grosz also referred to 
an official ban on a demonstration oct 23 that was to mark the 
start of the 1956 anticommunist uprising 
several hundred hungarians defied the ban and police detained 
five people for making offensive statements 
on oct 23 1956 the character of the tragic events was mainly 
counterrevolutionary and we cannot permit the memory of a 
counterrevolution being marked as a signal event grosz said

parking five different classic rollsroyces in front of his art 
gallery so that tourists visiting the city would get a taste of what 
beverly hills is famous for 
spellerberg launched his new car show to get around a preliminary 
injunction prohibiting him from parking his navy blue 1954 silver 
wraith rollsroyce on rodeo drive for more than one hour at a time 
the order was issued last week by superior court judge edward 
kakita in response to claims by the city that the 200000 car is a 
nuisance when it is parked continually on rodeo drive 
police lt robert curtis said officers carefully watched 
spellerbergs rollsroyce rotation and saw no violation of the court 
order 
according to the order spellerberg is required to move his car 
at least 500 feet away after parking it for an hour in front of his 
business and is not allowed to return it there until four hours 
later

democrat michael dukakis turning to a 
little preaching in a baptist church told black supporters today 
they wont be shut out of a dukakis white house 
he was introduced at a church rally by the rev wallace s 
hartsfield who said that during the reagan administration there 
have been a few at the head of the table who refuse to pass the 
bread 
were not only going to pass the bread but youre going to be 
at the table dukakis said 
he opened his remarks by telling the crowd ive got a little 
preaching to do 
dukakis also also promised an aggressive stance against the south 
african government 
with mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen as president and vice 
president of the united states this nation is going to take the 
lead in breaking the back of apartheid he said as the 
predominantly black audience cheered 
dukakis is trailing in all national polls but he told the church 
audience in politics as you all know 11 days is an eternity 
there is time to do it 
dukakis played host at a town meeting thursday night in nearby 
independence harry trumans hometown saying he was inspired by the 
visit and confident he could like truman pull off an upset 
after a lively interview on cbs the democratic presidential 
nominee carried his enthusiasm to the town meeting dukakis likened 
his stances to trumans on a number of issues and laughed at 
reagans statement earlier in the day during a campaign trip to 
missouri for bush that truman would support the vice president and 
the republican party today 
i cannot imagine him supporting george bush dukakis said 
laughing as he spoke that has to be one of the most incredible 
statements of all time i know hed be foursquare behind the 
democratic ticket 
the visit to independence came at a time when dukakis trailing 
bush in national polls frequently invokes the name of truman and 
his 1948 upset over thomas dewey to support his prediction that the 
same will happen this year 
among those questioning dukakis at the town meeting was john 
truman the greatgreat nephew of harry truman john truman asked 
dukakis if he had anything in common with the late president 
were a little behind but were going to win promised 
dukakis 
my memory of president truman was that he demonstrated his 
passion by the things he did said dukakis promising to do the 
same with health care child care economic development and 
education programs were going to put our government on the side 
of average families 
he also invoked the lword republicans use at every 
opportunity to describe dukakis 
harry truman was a liberal who balanced budgets dukakis 
said thats who i am im someone who i like to think combines 
those strong progressive type values with fiscal conservatism he 
said 
dukakis promised to fulfill trumans dream of providing basic 
health insurance to all americans 
if harry s truman were here tonight hed be urging us to do 
it dukakis said 
the democrat also contended bush had avoided questions in the 
final weeks of the campaign 
if youre not willing to get out among people and take 
questions and respond in this kind of way then how do we know what 
youre going to do when youre president of the united states 
said dukakis who has hosted three town meetings in less than a week 
the cbs interview was part of the dukakis campaigns effort to 
broaden their candidates exposure and to draw a contrast with bush 
whose style since the second presidential debate appears designed to 
protect his lead in the polls by stressing proven themes and 
avoiding forums that could create openings for the democrats 
during the nearly 15minute cbs appearance dukakis stressed his 
theme that he and running mate lloyd bentsen are on the side of 
average americans while bush is the candidate of privilege who wants 
to dole out a multibillion dollar tax break to the nations 
wealthiest 1 percent 
i want the government of this country to be on the side of 
average americans and i think thats a fundamental difference 
between me and george bush dukakis said in the cbs interview 
the candidate disputed bushs portrayal of him as being soft on 
crime taking about the mugging of his father and the hitandrun 
death of his only brother 
he also constrasted his choice of texas sen lloyd bentsen as his 
running mate with bushs pick of indiana sen dan quayle 
dukakis made the presidential decision bush made the political 
decision dukakis said

one of five people who ate death cap 
mushrooms at a dinner party is recovering from a successful liver 
transplant and a nationwide search is underway to find liver donors 
for two others 
the remaining two members of the dinner party who ate the 
mushrooms saturday were being evaluated hourly to determine if they 
also will need transplants 
dr c wright pinson director of the liver transplant program at 
oregon health sciences university estimated the chances were 
5050 that enough donor livers could be found for all five 
even if they all undergo transplants they could suffer permanent 
brain damage doctors said 
at a news conference thursday in portland pinson said the 
patient who underwent surgery and the two awaiting transplants had 
suffered irreversible liver damage when such damage occurs he 
said the patient usually dies in two to four days 
even when you list a patient at a very high priority as weve 
listed our patients it takes an average of 3 days to find a graft 
so you see we have some inherent logistical problems here pinson 
said 
dr emmet keeffe chairman of the committee that determines who 
will get liver transplants at oregon health sciences university 
said doctors believe only three liver transplants had been performed 
in the united states because of death cap mushroom poisoning all 
three survived he said 
preston alexander president of the oregon mycological society 
identified the mushrooms as amanita phalloides which doctors say 
are the most deadly of all mushrooms 
among other things the poison prevents the liver from producing 
protein basically the liver just dies off said pat forsyth 
spokeswoman for the university of californiasan francisco medical 
center 
the species is common in europe but has been found only in recent 
years in the western united states doctors had to speak at length 
with doctors in europe to learn more about the poison pinson said 
eating less than one of the mushrooms can be fatal alexander 
said dr muhamud daya assistant professor of emergency medicine at 
oregon health sciences university said the five who became ill ate 
a total of at least 10 
john and teresa duncan of portland were the hosts of the dinner 
party where the mushrooms were eaten alexander said 
alexander said the duncans daughter told him some members of the 
dinner party had picked the mushrooms while searching for chestnuts 
on the washington side of the columbia river gorge 
the mushrooms resemble a variety that is sold commercially in the 
orient he said 
glenda sabolyk 41 of clackamas underwent transplant surgery 
thursday at the university of californiasan francisco medical 
center dr nancy ascher director of the ucsf transplant program 
and head surgeon during the operation said the new liver appeared 
to be functioning well 
doctors were searching for a donor liver for mrs duncan 43 who 
was in critical condition at oregon health sciences university 
hospital her husband who declined to reveal his age was in 
serious condition at bess kaiser hospital in portland where doctors 
said he had improved thursday 
a fourth patient was at the san francisco hospital awaiting a 
suitable donor and the fifth was being evaluated at university

the missing skipper of a ship that 
sank with hundreds aboard sailed six hours through raging seas 
before changing course in a hopeless attempt to escape typhoon ruby 
an official said today 
rescuers continued searching today for up to 253 people reported 
missing from mondays disaster 
a coast guard spokesman in cebu city said two cutters and two 
commercial ships resumed the search at dawn around remote islands 
where the 2855ton dona marilyn sank 300 miles southeast of manila 
a shipping official said 201 people were rescued and 65 bodies 
recovered officials said survivors reached small islands that lack 
communications and some may have been counted twice by different 
government agencies 
there also was confusion over how many people were aboard the 
dona marilyn when it sailed sunday from manila for tacloban on 
leyte island sulpicio lines the ships owner says there were 421 
passengers and 66 crew members but the numbers have varied in 
reports by company and coast guard officials 
figures compiled today from red cross and government agencies 
showed the typhoon also killed 233 other people on land before 
roaring into the south china sea on tuesday 
manila newspapers said today the names of 52 people reported 
rescued do not appear on the ships manifest but some of those 
could be crew members since sulpicio has not released a complete 
list of its employees who were aboard 
jose alcuaz chairman of the national telecommunications 
commission told a senate committee today that according to company 
records capt eliodoro salgado radioed at 214 am monday that he 
was reducing speed because of big waves 
at 728 am salgado who is listed as missing reported 
shutting down his engines because of minor difficulties and was 
being buffeted by very strong winds and waves alcuaz said 
later alcuaz said the captain reported changing course at 820 
am and was headed west away from the typhoon sulpicio says the 
ship sank at about 3 pm after the crew tried vainly to pump out 
seawater 
survivors interviewed by manila television station gma said many 
passengers were trapped in their cabins when the ship sank 
bernardo cabigon sulpicio station manager in tacloban said one 
elderly couple refused the crews instructions to leave embraced 
one another and sank with the ship 
cabigon quoted surviving crew members as saying the chief 
engineer gave up his place in a lifeboat to a passenger and 
disappeared in the raging seas 
a sulpicio official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the ships purser kerwin lim reached an island but was stabbed to 
death by residents who stole his gold necklace and threw his body 
into the surf 
president corazon aquino has threatened to suspend the owners 
operations for letting the liner sail into the storm 
mrs aquino said thursday she may take action if the department 
of transportation finds the company negligent 
philip tuazon administrator of the governments maritime 
industry authority said sulpicio was ordered to appear at a hearing 
next wednesday to explain why we should not suspend them 
jose baldicanas the governments transportation undersecretary 
said the ship received a permit to sail because the weather was 
clear when it left for tacloban 350 miles to the southeast 
another company ship was involved in one of the worlds worst 
peacetime shipping disasters when it collided in december 1987 with 
an oil tanker off mindoro island official reports put the death 
toll at about 1700 but most estimates placed the actual figure at 
more than 3000 only 28 people survived

a woman who faces up to life in 
prison on charges that she falsely accused two men of rape to get 
even has been released on bail and ordered to get counseling 
district judge kenneth kosnic ordered the counseling at a 
preliminary examination thursday and released christine burzynski 
from the macomb county jail here on a 5000 bond 
burzynski testified in january that two men raped her at gunpoint 
outside a bowling alley in an eastern detroit suburb 
but in june she admitted that she fabricated the charge 
sterling heights detective gino hliebay testified thursday 
she said it had something to do with getting even with them for 
some reason hliebay told the judge 
after she recanted prosecutors dropped charges against the men 
who had insisted they were innocent polygraph tests showed they 
believed they were telling the truth the detective said 
assistant prosecutor steven kaplan said the woman had sex with 
the two men at a motel on nov 5 1987 the day of the alleged rape 
and that they threatened to tell her boyfriend the threat 
apparently prompted the rape story she told her boyfriend who in 
turn talked her into contacting police he said 
she got herself cornered kaplan said 
burzynski was arraigned earlier this week on two charges of lying 
under oath which carries a penalty of up to life in prison she has 
not entered a plea and no trial date has been set

nato defense ministers today said 
the western alliance needs to maintain nuclear weapons with a 
variety of ranges in europe to take account of the scale and 
quality of the threat 
the statement released at the end of talks by the defense chiefs 
of the north atlantic treaty organization made no mention of 
belgiums refusal to endorse a report on the need for shortrange 
nuclear forces 
natos secretarygeneral manfred woerner said the ministers 
private talks were an occasion for full and frank discussion and 
this meeting was no exception he told reporters no decision on 
specific weapons systems are required now nor have they been taken 
us defense secretary frank carlucci said we are moving 
forward on a modernization program on a stepbystep basis were 
very satisfied with the way the meeting progressed 
belgiums defense minister guy coeme expressed concern about 
deciding now on the controversial issue of modernizing shortrange 
arms assuming any commitment now would be premature he said at 
a separate news conference 
natos shortrange arsenal has gained the spotlight of critics 
since the united states and the soviet union signed the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty in december by the end of 
1990 the treaty will eliminate all us and soviet landbased 
missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3400 miles 
shortrange weapons generally have a range of less than 300 miles 
in their statement the ministers said our stepbystep 
approach under which decisions will be taken when necessary will 
ensure that natos nuclear forces continue to provide a credible and 
effective contribution to the alliances strategy of deterrence 
it said the ministers agreed that for the foreseeable future 
nato requires diversified survivable and operationally flexible 
nuclear forces in europe across the entire spectrum of ranges which 
take account of the scale and quality of the threat 
the officials the statement said were encouraged by signs of 
change in the policies of the soviet union and some of its allies 
but it added we have seen as yet no relaxation in their military 
efforts 
in particular it said warsaw pact superiority in 
conventional forces with the capability this provides for surprise 
attack and large scale offensive action constitutes a basic source 
of instability and tension between east and west 
as a result the ministers said they were determined to take 
necessary actions to maintain alliance security and maintain the 
credibility of our deterrent forces conventional and nuclear which 
will be kept uptodate where necessary 
the high level group report sought support for the concept of 
continuing to rely on shortrange nuclear weaponry as a pillar of 
alliance defense

place of talks we are considering them wu jinguang a spokesman 
for the state nationalities affairs commission said today his

a couple accepted a 220000 settlement and 
ended their fouryear 7 million civil rights suit charging that 
officials of new port richey harassed them and tried to run them out 
of town 
erin sullivan and terence brennan claimed city officials labeled 
them hippies and troublemakers and violated their rights by 
trying to silence their protests of city actions 
the settlement which included lifting a 4yearold lien against 
their home came wednesday just as the case was to go to trial in 
federal court here 
we fought city hall and we won ms sullivan said 
it does close the book and im happy for that added brennan 
brennan and ms sullivan moved to pasco county in 1981 from 
berkeley calif 
in their lawsuit they contended that as early as 1982 they drew 
the ire of thenmayor george henry when they attended council 
meetings and opposed some of the mayors favorite projects 
former city employees including the former police chief and fire 
chief testified in depositions that henry wanted to run the couple 
out of town 
among other things the couple were cited for buildingcode 
violations for things such as peeling paint and keeping a dead tree 
in their yard 
when brennan and ms sullivan sought to dispute the citations 
they were fined over time the fines added up to a cap of 25000 
the approximate value of their home liens were placed on their home 
and the city even began foreclosure proceedings 
present and past officials of the city just north of tampa 
stressed that the settlement did not constitute an admission of 
wrongdoing 
im glad its all over and there was no admission of guilt 
henry said 
wednesdays settlement is the second time they have collected 
from new port richey 
in 1986 they filed suit claiming city officials violated public 
records laws by withholding documents they requested for their 
federal case they won that case and the city agreed earlier this 
year to pay them 49000 for attorneys fees the case also cost the 
city 22000 for its own legal fees

well we are not letting up 
were not going to be talking on the negative side anymore 
he added immediately launching into his criticism of dukakis and 
the furlough program for massachusetts prison inmates 
bush concluded by saying now its going to be a kinder and 
quieter finish to this campaign 
earlier in the day bush also voiced some reservations about the 
way the campaign had been waged 
in a white circussized tent at applied materials co in 
californias silicon valley bush said that some of the modern 
campaigning with tv and spinning and sound bites might have gotten 
out of hand 
spinning is the term applied to efforts by campaign lieutenants 
to shape the perception of their candidates performance sound 
bites are the 15 to 30second snatches of a speech that wind up in a 
television or radio broadcast 
bush in his santa clara speech accused dukakis of trying to 
scare the american people by putting japanese flags in his 
television commercials and said the right way to gain world markets 
for us exports is by opening them not shrinking from competition 
he said dukakis should explain why his thinly veiled comments 
about foreign investment only mention japan which he said ranks 
only third as a source of foreign investment in the united states 
footage of the japanese flag appears in a dukakis ad challenging 
bushs record as head of a commission that examined usjapanese 
trade relations the ad is running in ohio 
bush said he would promote us trade but not with protectionist 
measures 
it doesnt make sense to stick our heads in the sand as some 
in the other party have suggested and try to build walls around 
america the vice president said it doesnt make sense to 
launch a trade war and plunge america and the world into a recession 
and it is beneath the dignity of the presidency and of the 
voters to try to incite fear of foreigners as a cheap means of 
winning a few votes bush said 
later at the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles bush toured 
a holocaust museum with his wife barbara and then told a courtyard 
audience we have no room in our communities for hidden nazi 
fugitives or war criminals every last one of them must be found and 
brought to justice

michael dukakis rallied supporters at a church today with a 
declaration that 11 days is an eternity and time enough to catch 
george bush before election day bush suggested americans would wake 
up to a gloomy morning if dukakis should be elected 
bush celebrated like the frontrunner he is thursday night at a 
party at bob hopes house but dukakis also was upbeat at a rally 
early today at a baptist church in kansas city mo 
in politics as you all know 11 days is an eternity dukakis 
said there is time to do it 
he was introduced by the rev wallace s hartsfield who said 
that during the reagan administration there have been a few at the 
head of the table who refuse to pass the bread 
dukakis who opened his remarks by saying ive got a little 
preaching to do promised hartsfield things would change in a 
dukakis white house 
were not only going to pass the bread but youre going to be 
at the table he told the predominantly black audience 
dukakis who hosted a town meeting thursday night in nearby 
independence harry trumans hometown said he was inspired by the 
visit and confident he could like truman pull off an upset 
to win he will have to defy the polls much as truman did in 1948 
the newest batch of surveys including one thursday showing a 
ninepoint bush lead range from eight to 15 points 
bush said thursday night that he would not be talking on the 
negative side in the closing days of the race but that didnt 
seem to last long 
he told a business group in los angeles today that dukakis 
wants to torpedo the prosperity weve worked so hard to achieve 
bush said peace means you can sleep at night knowing the world 
will still be there in the morning prosperity means you can sleep 
at night knowing that opportunity will still be there in the morning 
you know about our mornings bush said but i ask you to 
consider what kind of morning would electing the liberal governor 
of massachusetts bring will it be gloomy will the dark clouds of 
pessimism and limited possibility obscure our vision 
thursday night at a stop in kansas city dukakis sat for a 
14minute interview with dan rather on the cbs evening news 
where he conceded that gop advertising had hurt his candidacy 
theres no mystery about why they put those ads on they have 
done damage theres no question about that he said 
dukakis suggested that bush resorted to the commercials to 
divert public attention from the fact that this administration has 
probably had more corruption and malfeasance than any in recent 
memory if not in history 
the democratic nominee was continuing his campaign in missouri 
today before heading to michigan and later boston dukakis running 
mate lloyd bentsen was focusing on california and its electoral 
prize of 47 votes before returning to his home state of texas 
bush was also targeting california before traveling to nebraska 
where he planned a joint appearance with sen david karnes the 
republican candidate faces an uphill battle with former nebraska 
gov bob kerrey for the senate seat 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle was touring the 
pennsylvania dutch region and scheduled a series of appearances 
at the states high schools 
the republican ticket according to an nbc newswall street 
journal poll released thursday leads dukakisbentsen 51 percent to 
42 percent considerably closer than the 17 points in a similar poll 
done just after the oct 13 debate 
the survey conducted among 1285 likely voters had a margin of 
error of plus or minus three percentage points 
as he campaigned in the west bush said the pacific nations 
represent huge and growing markets for american goods if we 
dont turn and run away 
i will make sure that our trading partners continue to 
understand that our markets are vital to their growth as well 
bush said free trade must be fair trade a bush administration 
will keep the heat on 
but bentsen in a speech to the world affairs council in los 
angeles said that under the leadership of the reagan 
administration the united states had become an international 
debtor dependent on foreign investors as it battles huge trade and 
budget deficits 
the united states must be able to compete not only militarily 
but economically bentsen said 
dukakis in the cbs interview reiterated his populist view that 
the democratic ticket favors average americans while bush is the 
candidate of the privileged class 
i want the government of this country to be on the side of 
average americans and i think thats a fundamental difference 
between me and george bush the democratic nominee said 
meanwhile the dukakis campaign announced that it is doubling its 
budget for hispanic ads targeting seven states with large hispanic 
voter populations 
the campaign also is spending about 3 million 10 percent of 
its media budget on blackoriented television and radio ads which 
began three weeks ago 
in five of the radio ads former democratic candidate jesse 
jackson tells listeners we have the power to make mike dukakis 
president lets use it

a drug test that analyzes hair samples can be 
used in a child custody battle in which a man claims his wife is 
unfit because of cocaine abuse an appeals court has ruled 
lawyers in the case said thursday it is apparently the first time 
that a party in a matrimonial case has received court permission to 
have the other party undergo the test called radioimmunoassay 
the test uses radiation to determine what compounds have been 
deposited during the hairs growth 
frank burgel the husband is happy that the court has 
recognized the importance that children will be raised in a 
drugfree environment said his attorney peter bronstein 
three judges of the state appellate division second department 
agreed with a lower court that the test is admissible in the process 
of gathering evidence prior to trial 
their decision returned monday did not address the issue of 
whether such test results would be admissible during the trial 
two judges in a dissenting opinion recommended that a hearing 
be held to determine the scientific reliability and validity of the 
test 
burgel and his wife ninni of scarsdale are in the midst of a 
divorce and are both seeking custody of their children an 
11yearold girl and a 9yearold boy 
burgel 40 a businessman received permission in december from 
state supreme court justice john marbach to have his wife submit to 
the taking of two small hair samples 
he charged in court papers that mrs burgel had a cocaine habit 
since 1982 that made her unfit to have custody of the children 
mrs burgel 37 who initiated the divorce proceeding has 
admitted she used cocaine in the past but says she stopped using it 
several months before the custody dispute began 
burgels motion said the radioimmunoassay results combined with 
the known average growth rate of human hair could provide a 
calendar or timetable of the subjects cocaine use 
during the appeal of marbachs ruling mrs burgel has been 
ordered not to cut or treat her hair 
mrs burgels attorney sanford dranoff said he agreed with the 
dissenting judges that a hearing on the validity of the test should 
be required

lawmakers who say they were doublecrossed by a 
presidential veto are promising to revive legislation that would 
protect federal workers exposing government fraud and waste 
howls of bipartisan outrage were generated thursday after 
congressional sponsors learned that president reagan wont sign the 
legislation that his office of management and budget agreed in 
writing to support 
this is hardly the first time that a presidential veto has 
stirred controversy in congress but the reaction was harsher this 
time because democrats and republicans accused the administration of 
breaking its word 
lawmakers said they relied on letters to sponsors by the deputy 
director of the office of management and budget joseph r wright 
jr expressing the administrations backing of the legislation 
sen carl levin dmich the chief senate sponsor said the 
measure will be introduced again when congress reconvenes early next 
year sen charles grassley riowa echoed the statement 
reagan who said the version passed by congress went too far in 
protecting workers said he will submit his own bill in january 
before leaving office 
but the 4180 house vote and unanimous voice vote in the senate 
for the congressional version make it unlikely that a reagan 
alternative would prevail 
attorney general dick thornburgh raised constitutional objections 
to the bill which was designed to protect federal 
whistleblowers from retaliation by their superiors 
the attorney general persuaded reagan on wednesday to pocket 
veto the legislation let it die while congress is out of session 
thornburgh told reporters thursday that no one is entitled to 
the protection of unconstitutional legislation he contended that 
the justice department consistently expressed constitutional worries 
to lawmakers and never signed off on the compromise that passed 
congress 
asked if wright had approval to deal with congress on the 
legislation thornburgh replied i dont know 
it was unclear whether omb and justice department officials knew 
they were pulling in opposite directions but congressional staffers 
said they assumed wright checked with other agencies before writing 
of the administrations support 
omb spokeswoman barbara clay declined to discuss an apparent 
internal rift saying only the decision has been made by the 
president and we support the decision 
lawmakers didnt buy thornburghs explanation that his department 
expressed its unhappiness with the bill to congress during any 
number of exchanges 
its outrageous conduct and has created a bipartisan explosion 
because it violates the basic understanding we need but now no 
longer have that an administrations word is good said levin 
theres going to be bipartisan hell to pay 
rep frank horton of new york the chief republican house 
sponsor said he backed the measure only when i was assured of the 
administrations support 
horton called reagans decision a reprehensible act 
orchestrated after adjournment of the congress to prevent an 
override 
grassley said the administration had signed off on the bill 
before thornburgh stepped in 
we worked with the administration far too closely for 
thornburgh and company to now suggest there are unresolved 
constitutional questions but then this administration hasnt 
exactly a sterling record where whistleblowers are concerned 
chief house sponsor patricia schroeder dcolo said in 1981 
president reagan promised to protect employees who blow the whistle 
on wrongdoing now we know how cheap the presidents words are 
reagan said wednesday the bill would have allowed employees who 
are not genuine whistleblowers to manipulate the process to delay 
or avoid proper discipline 
i regret that the congress did not present me with 
constitutional and effective legislation to expand the protections 
and procedural rights afforded to federal employees who report 
fraud waste and abuse they discover in federal programs the 
president said in a statement 
the interests of both employees and managers should be fully 
protected the president said 
sponsors said the whistleblower bill was needed because the 
office of special counsel established to represent the interests of 
whistleblowers was not doing its job 
the bill was designed to reverse decisions of courts and the 
merit systems protection board a federal judicial agency that made 
it difficult for whistleblowers to win their cases 
the bill would have made the office of special counsel an 
independent agency and would have defined its role clearly as one of 
protecting whistleblowers the office now is part of the merit 
systems protection board and at times it has acted against 
whistleblowers who came to the office for help

president raif dizdarevic told 
government officials today that nationwide unrest threatens 
political stability and he urged quick economic reform an official 
report said 
political and ethnic tensions have increased to such a degree 
that the political security situation has seriously deteriorated 
dizdarevic told an emergency session of the collective presidency he 
leads and its cabinet 
the collective presidency has nine members who represent regions 
across the nation its rotating annual president functions as chief 
of state 
economic and social problems have combined to prompt months of 
antigovernment demonstrations with calls for an overhaul of 
communist party leadership and introduction of a multiparty system 
 
the perspective of the exit from the economic crisis can not be 
put off any longer dizdarevic was quoted as saying by tanjug the 
official news agency it is the final hour in which we direct 
and concentrate all forces for final preparation of the economic 
reform 
communist leaders have faced hundreds of strikes in recent months 
after eight years of economic crisis that have eroded the standard 
of living annual inflation stands at 217 percent and employment is 
15 percent 
at the same time serbian nationalist demonstrations have 
heightened friction between serbs and other groups in this fragile 
confederation of republics 
only two emergency meetings of government leaders both dedicated 
to economic problems have been held since world war ii in 1981 and 
1985 
dizdarevic also appealed to the soviet union to help yugoslavia 
cope with its 17 billion deficit in trade with moscow 
the partys policymaking central committee held a session 
earlier this month and pledged radical economic reforms including 
introduction of a marketoriented economy and stimulation of private 
entreprise the changes are expected to be adopted by parliament by 
the end of the year

residents with snow plows who are willing to help 
clear their neighbors streets for free will have to obtain some 
pricey insurance and a city permit this year or their good deed 
could land them a fat fine 
its what the city attorneys office says we need to do to 
protect the city john mrozek director of the denver department 
of public works said thursday 
mrozek unveiled city snow preparations this week noting that the 
city council hasnt financed plowing of residential streets despite 
angry demands after a big storm last winter 
what the city will do is let neighborhood groups chip in to hire 
contractors for plowing mrozek said but those contractors must 
have permits and insurance 
the new regulation is aimed at commercial plowing firms but 
mrozek admitted that it covers anyone even the neighbor down the 
block with a plow blade on his jeep who clears the road as a favor 
we cant limit it to one certain segment we have to open it to 
anybody mrozek said i have no idea whether it will discourage 
somebody or not 
mike musgrave an aide to mrozek said the city would exercise 
some judgment about plowing permits but it wont send squads of 
inspectors out to nab people who give neighbors a hand 
the rule may be clarified said city attorney steve kaplan 
insurance agents gave prices ranging from 350 to 1260 a year 
for the required liability injury and property damage coverage of 
up to 1 million per incident 
its a case of legality casting too long a shadow said 
councilman bob crider 
what happens when you put something into the law and get the 
city attorneys involved they write all that stuff and it takes away 
all the fun of life crider said 
i dont want to say somebody should break the law but if 
somebody wants to clear the road in front of my house id sure give 
him a cup of coffee

sen dan quayle trying to ward off 
complacency that might keep george bush voters home on election day 
today campaigned through pennsylvania dutch county saying were 
not taking anything for granted 
quayle was on a bus tour with a series of stops at schools and 
rallies in the state which is viewed as one of several close 
contests between republican presidential nominee bush and his 
democratic opponent michael dukakis 
its still seen as a battleground state we have a slight 
lead said quayle adviser ken khachigian 
quayles mission was to energize voters in light of predictions 
voter turnout could be low and gop worries that complacency could 
dash the lead that bush has been enjoying in the polls 
quayle was touring republican strongholds as well as democratic 
areas that supported president reagan in 1984 this area is 
clearly a good republican area and were trying to beef up turnout 
here said quayle adviser jim cicconi as quayle arrived in 
lancaster 
the vice presidential candidate was joined by sen arlen specter 
and rep bob walker both rpa as he spoke to a gymnasium full of 
children and high school students at manheim township high school 
he urged the youths to join the fight against drug abuse and told 
them if they wanted to go to college no one will be denied that 
opportunity in a george bush administration 
on thursday quayle joked that dukakis cant figure out what to 
be for halloween a moderate a liberal or just himself 
if he dresses as a moderate he scares the liberals in his 
party if he dresses as a conservative nobody will believe it if 
he comes as he is he scares the american people the republican 
vice presidential nominee joked thursday night at a rally here 
quayles ostensible good humor capped a rough day on the campaign 
trail marred by a traffic accident involving a bus in the 
candidates motorcade and a school van later at the rally quayle 
had to yell above the steady din of produkakis hecklers and his own 
supporters who were trying to shout the protesters down 
the accident en route to bedminster nj occurred when a bus 
carrying quayles mother and aunt and staff members fell slightly 
behind the rest of the motorcade and collided at an intersection 
with a school van carrying three teenagers 
quayle later visited the emergency room where press secretary 
david prosperi said the students and their driver were being treated 
for bumps and bruises but nothing serious 
no one in the quayle bus was hurt 
later quayle traveled to syracuse where he encountered a 
disruptive audience during the candidates speech a man in the 
front row stood shook his finger at quayle and shouted even after 
a pair of tall quayle supporters stood in front of the demonstrator 
with signs 
at one point two secret service agents came down off the stage 
to stand within a few feet f the man between him and quayles 
lectern on the stage quayle supporters yelled at the man and tried 
to cheer above other chanting and shouting by dukakis supporters in 
the crowd 
the indiana senator was unruffled in dealing with the situation 
but interrupted his speech several times to address the 
demonstrators 
were glad to have you here and this is a free contry and you 
have the right to freedom of speech but so do i he said 
sit down and enjoy the speech its going to be a great one 
he told the shouting man 
then later he said sternly despite what you may say these 
people are going to hear what i have to say 
the bus accident had delayed his earlier new jersey appearance 
where quayle used a satellite speech to atampt employees to dramatize 
his belief that america has a mission to make things work for 
everyone 
he spoke at the atampt control center for the digital long distance 
network and his remarks to about 2000 employees were carried via 
satellite to 29 other atampt facilties around the state 
he said the company represents the technological changes of the 
future adding anyone prepared to lead us into the 1990s and then 
into the 21st century must be prepared to harness this change to 
capture its spirit its momentum and its excitement so that we turn 
challenge into achievement 
america is the envy of the world because america has a 
mission to make things work for everyone we never stop trying to 
improve our lives to improve our sociey to build something of value 
for generations that follow us he said

federal agents have obtained an arrest warrant 
for financier adnan khashoggi in connection with fraud and 
racketeering charges filed against him and deposed philippine 
president ferdinand marcos the los angeles times reported today 
meanwhile the saudi arabian businessman is believed to be 
lying low in a european country while he consults with advisers 
about how he should respond to the fraud and racketeering 
indictment the newspaper said 
the times citing unnamed sources said officials believe 
khashoggi wont surrender to face the us charges 
the sources said the warrant was issued in an effort to find 
khashoggi before he relocates to a country without formal 
extradition agreements with the united states 
sources close to khashoggi told the newspaper the financier is 
considering returning to his native saudi arabia 
although he believes he would ultimately be cleared of the 
charges the sources said he is concerned about the possibility of 
being arrested jailed and extradited to the united states 
an englishlanguage newspaper in saudi arabia arab news of 
jiddah reported thursday under a riyadh dateline that khashoggi 
vehemently denies the charges the newspaper declined to say how 
it had received the statement 
he is disappointed that a technical legal question involving 
the scope of an injunction in a civil case to which he was not a 
party has been converted into a criminal allegation in a totally 
unprecedented manner the newspaper said he is confident that 
when all of the facts are made public as the proceeding progresses 
his lack of culpability will become manifest 
the united states has extradition agreements with france britain 
and spain the countries where khashoggi currently maintains his 
primary residences 
no such agreement exists with saudi arabia however 
khashoggi whose wealth once symbolized the rising economic power 
of the oilrich arab world in the 1970s was once reported to be the 
worlds richest man but his financial empire began to crumble amid 
a pile of debt in the early 1980s 
the us government is now accusing him of acting as a front for 
marcos to help divert assets and hide marcos ownership of real 
estate and valuable art 
meanwhile marcos arraignment in new york was delayed thursday 
by us district judge john f keenan until a courtappointed doctor 
can examine the 71yearold former philippine leader 
marcos attorneys argued he was too ill to travel to new york for 
the arraignment however his wife imelda was ordered to appear in 
new york on monday

massachusetts attorney general today blasted the 
training of cadets at a regional police academy but said he planned 
no prosecution of officials after 16 cadets were hospitalized 
following rigorous training 
attorney general james shannon concluded that the incident at the 
academy at agawam resulted from a massive failure in the method of 
training police cadets by the criminal justice training council 
my investigation shows that individuals involved in the 
training of class 12 from top to bottom failed woefully in their 
duties he said 
however shannon added i have concluded based upon the facts 
now known to me and upon the circumstances as they now stand that 
no criminal prosecution is appropriate in this case 
shannon said there is no criminal statute that fairly fits 
the facts and conduct here at issue and that none of the 
instructors acted with the intent that any cadet be seriously 
injured or harmed 
the attorney generals investigation was requested by north adams 
mayor john barrett iii last month after 16 out of 50 cadets were 
hospitalized in their first week of training at the police academy 
the investigation was later widened to include a look into 
allegations of financial and hiring improprieties at the 
massachusetts criminal justice training council which runs the five 
regional police academies including agawam 
at a statehouse news conference shannon recommended the 
abolition of the criminal justice training council and a complete 
revamping of training procedures but he did not offer his own plan 
shannon one of 23 members of the training council said he took 
responsibility for his own role in a chain of command that ignored 
warnings of trouble for example shannon said there have been 12 
ambulance calls to the agawam academy in the past four years that 
should have indicated a problem he said 
cadets at agawam said they underwent 10 hours of pushups laps 
and other exercise on a few cups of water in their first day of 
training sept 19 several cadets reported brown urine and 
abdominal pains during the week one cadet collapsed from heat 
stroke on the first day 
one of the hospitalized cadets timothy shepard of pittsfield 
became comatose and had to undergo a liver transplant in late 
september he emerged from the coma two weeks after his collapse 
from heat stroke but remained in serious condition today at a 
pittsburgh hospital 
a state public health report concluded that all 50 cadets 
suffered dehydration and muscle fiber breakdown from strenuous 
exercise coupled with insufficient water intake

the federal aviation administration has gotten 
clearance for a payincrease plan designed to attract more 
experienced air traffic control employees in the nations three 
largest metropolitan areas 
the office of personnel management approved a demonstration 
project thursday calling for the faa to boost pay by as much as 20 
percent for some employees at hardtostaff air traffic control 
centers in the new york los angeles and chicago areas 
the fiveyear experiment will determine whether incentives are an 
effective tool in recruiting and retaining personnel transportation 
secretary james burnley said 
this project should make it possible for faa to achieve full 
staffing at facilities where living costs highly complex operations 
or other factors have made them less attractive locations for 
employees he said 
more than 60 percent of the 2000 employees eligible for the 
bonus pay will be controllers burnley said the rest are safety 
inspectors and the technicians who maintain airtraffic control 
computers and other equipment 
journeyman or fullperformancelevel controllers and some 
inspectors at the nations busiest airports make up to 60683 
annually in base pay so a 20 percent salary differential would 
boost their pay to as much as 72819 faa spokesman fred farrar 
said today 
however he said not all controllers and inspectors receive that 
much and farrar was not certain of the pay scale for technicians 
the faa said facilities chosen for the pay incentives include air 
route traffic control centers at chicago and new york control 
towers and terminal radar approach control centers at ohare 
international and los angeles international airport terminal radar 
approach centers at new york and santa anna calif and flight 
standards district offices at los angeles farmingdale ny valley 
stream ny and teterboro nj 
the pay incentives are to begin next may

health minister claude evin today ordered a 
pharmaceutical company to resume distribution of an abortion pill in 
the interest of public health and the company said it will comply 
the firm roussel uclaf said it had no choice but to obey evins 
order it said it will resume distributing the drug to approved 
abortion clinics 
roussel uclaf announced wednesday it was pulling the drug off the 
market in response to an outcry of public opinion at home and 
aboard from abortion foes and a threatened boycott of its products 
the health ministry order was issued after evin met with 
executives of the company which manufactures the ru 486 pill also 
known as mifepristone roussel uclaf is part of the giant west 
german chemical group hoescht which has the majority share the 
french government has a 36 percent share 
roussel uclaf said a debate on public morality which it was 
not qualified to arbitrate led to the decision to withdraw the pill 
the ministry said evin summoned perre joly a roussel uclaf vice 
president to his office to express displeasure with the companys 
decision it said evin reminded him that while the company could 
make its own decisions evin was responsible for public health 
it said the 1975 law legalizing abortion in france must be 
applied and that voluntary abortions constituted a right for women 
in this country 
ru 486 is an advance because it does not involve use of an 
anesthetic the precautions for supply of this drug solely in 
specified abortion clinics provides for all the required 
indispensible guarantees of security the communique said 
with the interest of the publics health involved claude evin 
called on the roussel uclaf laboratory to resume distribution of ru 
486 and the laboratory said it would do so the statement said 
abortion foes including the roman cathlic church had welcomed 
the companys decision to suspend distribution while social 
leaders physicians from around the world and some politicians 
opposed it 
the drugs inventor etienne emile baulieu said the pill has 
been used in france on 4000 women with a 955 percent rate of 
effectiveness 
on thursday thousands of doctors attending a convention in rio 
de janeiro called on roussel uclaf to continue making an abortion 
pill or pass the patent onto another manufacturer the physicians 
are attending the weeklong world congress of gynecology and 
obstetrics 
officials at the health ministry maintained the company acted in 
order to protect its image abroad company officials said they had 
been inundated with mail from france and abroard especially the 
united states 
they said many letters threatened to boycott the companys 
products 
andre ulmann a rousse uclaf official who helped develop the 
pill told a news conference at the rio conference that the 
threatened boycott would have cost the company substantial sums of 
money so we decided to stop making the drug 
he did not specify the costs involved 
the pill blocks the action of progesterone a hormone essential 
in all phases of pregnancy researchers say it is effective in the 
first seven weeks of pregnancy particularly when used in 
conjunction with a second product called sulprotone or 
prostaglandin e 
they said the drug was not a doityourself morningafter pill 
that could be purchased at a supermarket and taken home its use 
requires medical supervision the government announced authorization 
of the drug sept 23 it has also been tested for use in china and 
india 
baulieu also at the rio meeting said roussel uclaf had decided 
to withdraw the drug for moral reasons 
there is absolutely no medical basis for the suspension which 
comes despite the approval of the drug by both the french and 
chinese governments in terms of safety and efficiency baulieu said 
the company is bowing to pressure from church groups and 
conservative sectors of society he said

police fired water cannons and 
hurled tear gas today to disperse about 5000 people who defied a 
ban on a rally marking the 70th anniversary of czechoslovakias 
independence 
helmeted police wielding batons swarmed through pragues 
wenceslas square to break up the crowd which chanted gestapo 
as the police charged 
earlier police arrested about 70 dissidents throughout the 
country in one of the biggest raids on activists in years 
at least 20 arrests were made in wenceslas square and some of 
those detained were beaten by police or had their arms twisted by 
plainclothesmen as they were taken to buses and driven away 
authorities banned the independent rally called a week ago by 
the charter 77 human rights group and four other independent 
organization 
but people came to wenceslas square at the rallying hour of 3 pm 
hundreds in the center of the square began singing the 
czechoslovak national anthem when police gave the first order to 
disperse and thousands of onlookers joined in 
chants of freedom long live freedom and masaryk 
rang out thomas garrigue masaryk was the founder and first 
president of the democratic republic of czechoslovakia founded oct 
28 1918 
police moved down the square hitting with batons onlookers who 
refused to move 
a charter 77 activist ladislav lis cried out in the name of 
the movement for civil freedom hurrah thousands roared in 
support 
the movement for civil freedom is a new civil rights organization 
police cleared the square in about 40 minutes and then moved 
toward the national museum at the top of the square where hundreds 
stood on the steps watching the action below 
chants of gestapo went up as police trucks with water 
cannons began spraying spectators 
tear gas billowed below a slogan atop the museum declaring 
seventy years all power in the czechoslovak socialist republic 
belongs to the working people 
the turnout surprised observers who thought a police sweep of 
dissidents and repeated warnings by authorities not to attend the 
rally would deter people 
in august the square was the site of an unexpected protest by 
thousands of people on the anniversary of the 1968 warsaw pact 
invasion that crushed the liberal era of communistled reforms known 
as the prague spring 
anna sabatova an activist with the committee for the unjustly 
prosecuted said about 70 activists were detained in the police 
sweep which she said began thursday 
also thursday president gustav husak declared a limited amnesty 
that could free some political prisoners and communist officials 
held an official independence rally 
the countrys general prosecutor jan pjescak was quoted by the 
communist party daily rude pravo as saying the amnesty was the 
biggest in years about 7000 prisoners are expected to go free and 
160000 other people will have charges dropped he was quoted as 
saying 
the action seemed intended to pardon firsttime offenders 
convicted of many kinds of crime and many people who have left the 
country illegally it could provide a chance for thousands of 
emigres abroad at least to visit their homeland if they have not 
engaged in political activity in exile 
ms sabatova estimated however that only eight political 
prisoners whose cases are followed by her group would be released 
hundreds of uniformed police and members of the paramilitary 
peoples militia were on duty thursday as authorities mounted their 
rally in wenceslas square it was the first official celebration of 
the independence anniversary in four decades of communist rule 
addressing tens of thousands massed in organized groups behind 
national flags red banners and official slogans at thursdays 
rally prague communist party head miroslav stepan said that 
unofficial groups will not be tolerated as they are in neighboring 
communist hungary 
czechoslovakias communists have inched cautiously toward very 
limited economic reforms in the wake of the more radical changes 
initiated by mikhail s gorbachev in the soviet union 
but they have made clear they do not intend to allow political 
pluralism 
we wont allow the process of restructuring and democratization 
to be abused by those who dont care for socialism and their 
homeland those who are trying to destabilize society stepan 
said 
there is no dialogue here he added

the neighborhood ilhardt said 
reneau died several hours later with bullet wounds in his chest 
and legs police have issued an arrest warrant in the killing for a 
man they identified as francois valmer 31 
the slaying first appeared to be the result of a territorial 
dispute between rival drug pushers but police then learned the men 
standing with reneau at the time of the driveby shooting were 
uninvolved in the drug trade ilhardt said 
all the young men hanging out there work or go to school he 
said they were trying to keep the neighborhood clean 
reneau and his friends and reneaus mother diane fairweather 
had badgered the man to quit selling drugs in the area ilhardt said 
the detective said the suspected drug dealer confronted ms 
fairweather tuesday night and he slashed all four tires of the 
ladys car accusing her of calling police on him and he and the 
victim reneau got involved in a heated argument

prime minister yitzhak shamir said friday there 
will be no international middle east peace conference if he wins the 
election and arab leaders will have to reconsider their opposition 
to direct talks with israel 
if i am elected it will become clear that this option doesnt 
exist any more and therefore the chances of resuming the 
negotiations in the framework of camp david will reemerge he 
said in an interview with the associated press 
arab leaders have refused his proposal to revive talks based on 
the 1978 camp david accords those agreements were the basis of the 
1979 peace treaty with egypt and envision limited autonomy for 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip where a 
rebellion began dec 8 
shamir leads the rightwing likud bloc in tuesdays election 
against the labor party of foreign minister shimon peres who has 
endorsed an international forum on the middle east 
in campaign speeches shamir has ruled out territorial 
concessions to the arabs and vowed to crush the uprising in which 
more than 300 palestinians have been killed 
he said he would not exclude the possibility of using greater 
force against the rebellion but stressed that israel must coexist 
with the 15 million palestinian residents of the lands it captured 
from jordan and egypt in 1967 
we understand our limitations in using force because after 
all we see the palestinian arabs living here as neighbors with whom 
we have to live in the future said the 73yearold premier who 
sat in an easy chair next to a blueandwhite israeli flag for the 
halfhour interview in his office 
efforts toward peace will suffer he declared if the plo 
declares palestinian independence which is expected at a palestine 
national council meeting next month the council acts as the 
palestine liberation organizations legislature 
it will be harmful said shamir who has vowed never to 
accept a palestinian state it will become an additional obstacle 
to improving the situation after such extreme declarations it will 
become for them painful to go back to retreat 
shamir said the arabs should not seek a onesided solution 
and noted that no process work without israels approval 
what is the use of these declarations if you dont have the 
consent of israel he said therefore they have to find a 
concept that would be acceptable to both parties 
to break the impasse over palestinian representation at peace 
negotiations the prime minister said arab states should assemble a 
temporary delegation that could discuss a plan for palestinian 
selfgovernment 
after agreement on an autonomy plan he said elections would be 
held in the occupied territories to chose palestinian negotiators 
for a second phase of talks on the permanent status of the west 
bank and gaza strip 
jordan refused to participate in talks on palestinian autonomy 
between egypt and israelm which broke down in 1981 
without egypt and jordan i think it would be very difficult to 
come to such an agreement shamir said i cannot imagine any 
agreement with the palestinian arabs without the help and active 
participation of some other countries 
shamir said an interview president hosni mubarak gave the kuwaiti 
daily al anbaa in january encouraged him to believe autonomy talks 
with egypt could be revived the prime minister quoted mubarak as 
saying it had been a mistake to end the talks 
negotiations between iran and iraq on ending their 8yearold war 
are a precedent for direct talks between israel and the arabs 
shamir said but he would oppose un involvement for the simple 
reason that the united nations represents a permanent antiisraeli 
majority 
in what he said would be his last interview before the election 
shamir rejected suggestions that he does not really seek peace 
i cannot be insincere he said smiling it is beyond my 
abilitities 
critics have questioned his commitment even to the camp david 
process because shamir who was speaker of the israeli parliament at 
the time abstained on the peace treaty with egypt 
shamirs explanation is that he fully supported the effort of 
making peace but abstained because the agreement called for 
abandoning jewish settlements in sinai and returning to the 1967 
borders with egypt 
i saw it as a dangerous precedent for the future he said 
in addition to not giving up captured land shamir said indicated 
during the campaign he would build new jewish settlements in the 
occupied territories the united states contends the 133 existing 
settlements with nearly 70000 jewish residents are an obstacle to 
peace

as the clock runs down on michael dukakis 
presidential hopes a mixture of determined optimism and 
helplessness envelopes the campaign staff jetting back and forth 
across the country with him 
poll findings suggest his chances of victory over george bush on 
nov 8 are small 
but the candidates group of aides and advisers generally avoids 
negative talk or fingerpointing over what went wrong in a campaign 
that once held a doubledigit lead in polls 
outside the fact were all tired the mood is excellent said 
francis obrien a senior adviser traveling with the candidate we 
wake up and say were going to win thats what i believe 
yet he adds now is it going to be hard are we behind yes 
dukakis himself has seemed uplifted on occasion by his crowds 
which sometimes are quite large he spoke with what seemed to be 
fresh resolve in invoking harry trumans comefrombehind memory 
this week 
and his staff was positively euphoric for the moment after what 
they considered a good interview thursday night with dan rather on 
cbs 
but other times he has seemed startlingly emotionless and 
reserved such as in his live interview on nightline tuesday 
night 
dukakis is dukakis said campaign senior adviser kirk 
odonnell hes as cool as they come 
odonnell was trying to persuade reporters that dukakis 
colorless performance in that 90minute network opportunity was not 
the disappointment many observers believed it was 
dukakis has seemed a bit wan at other times too in an interview 
on cnn host larry king asked do you think youve got a good 
shot 
dukakis replied simply i think weve got a shot 
in the abc interview he said i found it very difficult to 
give people in this country a real sense of who the real mike 
dukakis is 
you know people have said im kind of cool and dont have 
enough passion its very difficult to convey that 
privately some campaign staffers have revealed feelings and 
frustrations and a hint of exasperation one staffer musing about 
needing a vacation said he would have plenty of opportunities in 
another two weeks 
although open sniping hasnt broken out there are private 
suggestions that dukakis himself has been unwilling sometimes to go 
along with advisers ready to arm him with sharp attentiongetting 
lines 
a perception took hold that dukakis had booted away a last 
opportunity by a bloodless performance in his second debate with 
george bush in los angeles the mood was reinforced after his 
nightline performance 
standing the next day in a room set up with telephones for 
reporters to file their stories obrien the goodhumored adviser 
felt the sting of a reporters wit 
dont worry francis he was told playfully bob beckel made 
a lot of money after running a losing campaign 
it was a reference to walter mondales 1984 campaign manager who 
has gone on to become a widely quoted analyst on television 
commentary programs 
reporters constantly search for a metaphor for the dukakis 
campaign 
some saw one at a rally at diablo valley college in the suburbs 
east of oakland half a dozen buzzards circled lazily overhead 
before dukakis spoke 
others found it in pueblo colo where a brilliantly colored 
hotair balloon stood by the platform at a rally and fell to the 
ground deflating after he spoke 
on the campaign plane aides point to polls showing singledigit 
deficits as signs of encouragement 
odonnell tried selling the line that the nightline show was a 
great success and represented a crescendo 
but the campaign took on an aimless quality the next day dukakis 
stuck with his same stump speech adding very little as a 
consequence reporters had little new to write their stories about 
so many wrote about the campaigns dismal outlook 
aides insisted that the plan was to stick with the usversusthe 
rich economic theme along with his continuing complaints about 
nasty campaign tactics from the other side 
what do you expect us to say at this point said steve 
engelberg a traveling aide

foot of snow although rural hamlets in the hills south of buffalo 
got several inches of snow overnight the citys streets were clear 
the sky was sunny thursday morning and temperatures were in the 40s 
in fact 
we want a retraction said robert carr vice president of the

mayor james griffin also was angered by the broadcast and called 
harvey 
i guess you take your weather pretty seriously said john 
talmage a researcher for harvey 
harveys office said the information came from a story by united 
press international the upi story however did not say there had 
been snow in the city only in an area several miles south of 
buffalo 
the veteran broadcaster offered a correction on his 1205 pm 
broadcast 
well my usually reliable sources were not quite right 
harvey said adding that now buffalonians wont believe him when he 
says two whales are trapped by ice in lake erie

both men were in barcelona to attend a seminar on perestroika 
president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of economic and political 
restructuring 
korotich whose ogonyok magazine has been prominent in battling 
for greater public debate on important questions in the soviet union 
under gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness harshly criticized 
the soviet system of justice 
saying the matter of political prisoners in the soviet union was 
being handled in a questionable manner korotich said it is not 
known in which way they the prisoners were arrested and some have 
been released in an unknown fashion 
if they were arrested illegally then those who did the 
arresting should be tried for it under the law korotich said 
if they the political prisoners were released although they were 
guilty why was that done 
if it is thought that the prisoners have committed some crime 
then let them be publicly tried for it so we can know what they are 
accused of and watch with the penal code in our hand korotich 
said 
korotich at one point compared the soviet justice system to that 
of the spanish inquisition 
lubarski told the seminar he was disappointed with the statement 
by soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov in which he 
indicated the soviet union only held two dozen political prisoners 
there are at least 10 times that many political prisoners 
lubarski said

character 
michael dukakis hasnt sold his soul said the newspaper one

appointments are inevitable very soon 
thats enough we endorse dukakis

the new york post endorsed george bush for 
president on friday calling the republican nominee a champion of 
peace through strength a believer in lower taxes and a freemarket 
economy 
it said its chief reason for backing bush is that abroad and 
at home in foreign policy and in domestic affairs he will lead 
the nation in the right direction 
the newspaper called democrat michael dukakis a man of honor 
integrity and experience who has run a dignified and spirited 
campaign 
but he is wedded to the liberal agenda of the 1960s the 
paper said to deal with the challenges of the future dukakis 
instinct is to turn to the solutions of the past 
the only aspect of the bush candidacy that gave us pause was 
the presence on the republican ticket of sen dan quayle the post 
said but it added that the vice presidential nominee has been 
maligned way beyond his personal failings and is by no means as 
poor a choice as has been claimed

members of the supreme soviet today voted no 
for the first time to draft laws put forward by the executive 
presidium the laws to increase government control over public 
demonstrations still passed easily 
the break in the string of unanimous votes indicated president 
mikhail s gorbachev has had some success in his drive to 
democratize soviet society and encourage open debate 
a total of 31 deputies voted against a decree by the bodys 
executive council the presidium the measure gives broad powers to 
paramilitary police to keep order at demonstrations the number of 
votes in favor was 1348 with 24 abstentions 
the supreme soviets rubberstamp practice also was broken on a 
second decree passed by the presidium on july 28 it requires 
advance permission for public demonstrations and outlines fines and 
jail terms for violators a total of 13 deputies voted against the 
measure 1368 voted in favor and four abstained 
both votes were by a show of hands 
the supreme soviet also unanimously adopted a 795 billion budget 
for 1989 
the two decrees were the subject of extensive coverage in the 
official soviet press with some articles saying they should be 
amended 
activists complained that the paramilitary police who have been 
breaking up demonstrations in moscow and several other cities since 
the presidium adopted the decrees used brutal tactics 
pavel p goryunov a supreme soviet deputy from the estonian city 
of tartu argued in a 10minute speech that the decrees should not 
be adopted at the national level and that local government 
councils not the national interior ministry should decide when to 
use paramilitary troops to quell demonstrations 
he was followed by two other delegates who spoke in favor of the 
decrees a moscow subway worker and the chairman of the kiev city 
council 
in introducing the measures to the supreme soviets two chambers 
the soviet of the union and the soviet of nationalities tengiz 
n menteshashvili a presidium secretary said democracy is 
impossible without strict legality and discipline 
he cited february riots in the azerbaijani city of sumgait 
caused by a secession campaign by ethnic armenians in the republic 
as an example of why the laws on maintaining public order are needed 
but he held out the possibility the decrees might be amended in 
the future 
we still have to gain practical experience in democracy 
then we can introduce amendments menteshashvili told deputies in 
the kremlin 
decrees are normally voted on as a package and the scheduling of 
separate showofhand votes on the public order laws indicated 
opposition behind closed doors to the measures the votes were 
announced to the deputies 
the supreme soviet approved the budget after trimming a projected 
deficit of 58 billion to 55 billion 
deputies cut the projected deficit the first ever acknowledged 
by the soviet leadership by finding additional revenues 
the budget calls for most new investment to move from the 
traditional favorite heavy industry to improvements in the soviet 
standard of living 
soviet finance minister boris gostsev said thursday the 
government has been running a deficit for years because of losses by 
stateowned businesses 
deputies were told the deficit was caused by both inadequate 
revenues and unexpectedly high expenses specifically noted were a 
65 billion tax shortfall since 1985 due to an antialcohol campaign 
and a 65 billion decline in revenues from oil sales due to low 
world prices 
the official tass news agency said legislators discussed the 
spending plan at times very sharply 
the debates were comprehensive and profound boris kachura 
chairman of the planning and budget commission told tass 
legislators found possibilities for producing more consumer 
goods thus increasing government revenues by almost 24 billion 
as part of the plan several hundred factories manufacturing 
machines and equipment will be retooled to produce consumer goods 
most of the increased revenues will be allocated to reducing the 
deficit 
yuri maslyukov head of the state planning committee promised 
dramatic improvements as the government shifts from its traditional 
emphasis on heavy industry to improving the living standard 
maslyukov said farms will have two years to straighten out their 
operations before facing elimination 
central planning will be reduced by limiting the powers of 
planning ministries he said

a white teenager was tied up assaulted and 
robbed by a group of 20 blacks aboard a bus in an attack police say 
was racial in nature 
the victim whose name was not given because he is a juvenile

the gang of blacks moved in on him coleman said 
several restrained him while he was tied up with the cord and 
carried to the back of the bus where he was kicked in the head and 
body and ethnic comments were made coleman said he said he did 
not know exactly what was said 
the suspects also allegedly stole 5 from the teenager

the use of soviet icebreakers to help save two 
whales trapped off point barrow alaska is emboldening the coast 
guard to again seek presidential approval to add one or more of the 
polar ships to its fleet 
in what has been a yearly ritual for a decade the coast guard 
asks the white house for 300 million to build a new icebreaker and 
budget officials there always say no most recently as late as two 
weeks ago according to sources 
but that was all before two whales dubbed crossbeak and bonnet 
by those taking part in a herculean effort to save them became 
trapped under arctic ice a month ago and the united states called 
upon soviet icebreakers for help 
the whales trapped in the ice have raised the spectre of whats 
wrong with the american icebreaking fleet and the answer is 
everything said kurt oxley the house merchant marine and 
fisheries committee counsel for coast guard and navigation issues 
with only two we have to use them sparingly oxley said 
with four or five we could spread them out more evenly and 
possibly have had one up there 
the united states actually has three saltwater icebreakers now 
two are 399foot sister ships the polar star and the polar sea 
both built in the 1970s and based in seattle 
a third the northwind is a world war iivintage spoonshaped 
hull stationed out of wilmington nc that is scheduled to be 
decommissioned in january and relegated to the scrap heap 
the soviet union by contrast has at least 16 icebreakers 
including four powered by nuclear reactors 
the soviet union is an arctic nation they need that many 
says adm paul a yost jr the coast guards commandant we dont 
need that many were not an arctic nation 
but we do need at least four polar icebreakers yost said 
i think one will be all we can afford next year maybe well get 
another one in the years beyond that 
not if the pencil pushers in the white house putting together the 
federal budget have their way for every year dating back to and 
including jimmy carters presidency they have rejected the coast 
guards yearly request for 300 million for a new polar ship 
several sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said the 
white house office of management and budget turned down the latest 
request to include a new icebreaker in the presidents proposed 
budget for fiscal 1990 that begins next oct 1 
with two soviet icebreakers coming to the rescue of the two 
whales this week the coast guard has decided to make another stab 
at it the sources said 
yost would not confirm or deny that but he said the world 
attention focused on the fate of the whales has definitely been a 
positive impetus toward us getting a new icebreaker 
congress has directed that we build a new icebreaker and now 
its just up to the coast guard and the administration to see if we 
can fit one into the 1990 budget he said 
congress in 1986 ordered the construction of two new icebreakers 
by 1990 after a study by the administration concluded that the coast 
guard should have a minimum of four and better yet five in its 
fleet 
but nothing has happened since then because of federal budget 
deficits exceeding 150 billion each of the past three years and 
bickering over whether the coast guard should build a new ship or 
lease it from private companies as part of the administrations 
privatization goals 
over the past two years the coast guard has spent 2 million 
designing a new icebreaker the agency estimates the cost of 
construction at 300 million for one and 500 million for two if 
they are ordered at the same time 
even then a new icebreaker will take a minimum of seven years to 
build yost said 
meanwhile crowley maritime co of san francisco which now 
provides icebreaking services for oil companies operating on 
alaskas north slope has offered to build lease and operate an 
icebreaker crewed by civilians but commanded by coast guard officers 
for 40 million a year 
the coast guard was initially interested in our proposal two 
years ago and it fit in perfectly with the administrations 
privatization goals said tim mills a washington attorney 
retained by crowley to push the venture but then the coast guard 
changed its mind weve quit working on it 
the polar sea is now in seattle in preparation for a resupply 
mission to the antarctic in january 
the polar star is off nova scotia en route back to seattle 
through the panama canal after it was unable to break through the 
iceclogged beaufort sea west of prudhoe bay two weeks ago it had 
to head east through the northwest passage following the rescue of 
two icestuck canadian ships 
yost said the united states probably would have called on the 
soviet unions ship for help in any case since it was only 300 
miles away and had open water most of the way to where the whales 
were trapped 
no icebreaker not ours the russians or the canadians 
could have broken through from the west or east where the polar star 
was he said and our seattle icebreaker was 3500 miles away

the state department has asked asian nations to 
help investigate reports of widespread illegal salmon fishing in the 
north pacific including the possibility the fish are being 
laundered through canning processors in thailand 
american fishing groups have told the state department that the 
taiwanese japanese and perhaps south koreans are catching the 
salmon under the guise of fishing for squid the salmon are unloaded 
in singapore where they are frozen or in bangkok where they are 
canned and sold on the european market at roughly half the cost of 
us canned salmon 
it is very well organized and we believe the koreans are 
involved as well said barry collier president of the pacific 
seafood processors association we believe all three countries are 
laundering the fish in the same manner 
the seattlebased processors association estimates that 22 
million pounds of salmon or 6 million to 7 million individual fish 
worth about 18 million have been illegally caught so far this year 
the association which represents 80 percent of the seafood 
processors in alaska and washington state fears the illegal catches 
already are having a major negative impact on northwest and 
alaska salmon runs and also are undercutting sales of us canned 
salmon abroad 
us processors export about 500 million worth of salmon 
annually 
the industry allegations are being taken very seriously by the 
department and we are investigating them aggressively ed wolfe 
the state departments ambassador for oceans and fisheries said 
friday 
wolfe is scheduled to talk with japanese officials in tokyo about 
the reports of illegal salmon fishing next week in addition the 
international north pacific fisheries commission comprising 
representatives from the united states canada and japan meet in 
tokyo next week and wolfe said he expects salmon will be discussed 
the state department two weeks ago asked the us embassies in 
hong kong singapore thailand japan and south korea to ask those 
governments for assistance in the investigation 
the cable to the embassies told the us officials to stress the 
serious nature of the reports of illegal salmon fishing and that 
if true they represented a potential multimilliondollar loss to 
the us industry 
the state department has also asked the american institute in 
taiwan to urge the taiwanese to take steps to halt any illegal 
salmon fishing 
last week us and soviet negotiators in moscow called for 
joint enforcement efforts by the two countries aimed at 
disrupting illegal salmon fishing in the north pacific 
wolfe declined to say what actions were contemplated but added 
the soviets were very concerned about the north pacific salmon 
fishery 
in the early 1980s american fishermen had complained that 
japanese and taiwanese fishermen were taking large quantities of 
salmon in the huge drift nets they use to catch squid the gear used 
to catch squid can be similar to that used in harvesting salmon 
both japan and taiwan took steps in the mid1980s designed to 
outlaw illegal salmon fishing japan banned the importation of 
salmon caught illegally by its squid fleet and taiwan has a ban on 
the export of salmon

school districts should create separate units 
devoted to 4 to 8yearolds to ease the undue academic pressure 
that school reform too often has placed on young children a task 
force urged friday 
recent reforms aimed at making students more accountable and 
diligent may make sense for high school students but may be doing 
more harm than good when applied to younger pupils concluded the 
26member panel of the national association of state boards of 
education 
the reform movement has fostered a competitive mentality for 
our educational enterprise with unfortunate consequences for early 
segments of schooling said their 55page report right from the 
start the report of the nasbe task force on early childhood 
education 
if education is seen as a contest that pits children against 
their peers or a race against our foreign competitors we risk 
teaching very young children the wrong academic tasks before they 
are ready and we stimulate fears and pressure among parents they 
added 
the report released at the groups annual convention in chicago 
was produced by a task force consisting mainly of state and local 
school officials and early childhood education experts the panel 
met throughout 1988 holding hearings and visiting schools in 
atlanta boston chicago and san francisco 
its key recommendation was the creation of early childhood 
units with enough autonomy to cater effectively to the special 
educational and developmental needs of 4 to 8yearolds 
such units might be entirely separate from existing elementary 
schools or schools might designate an early childhood unit director 
responsible to the principal elementary schools might also set up a 
team of one or more teachers who would coordinate the activities of 
all teachers dealing with young children 
tom schultz the task forces staff director said the reasoning 
behind such separate facilities for the youngest pupils is that in 
many elementary schools the guiding educational philosophy tends to 
be skewed toward the needs of older children which too often leads 
to inappropriate teaching methods and goals for younger students 
an early childhood unit would help counter that pressure and 
bring about more meaningful assessments and practices schultz 
said in a telephone interview 
in a forward to the report task force chairman richard owens 
said we heard disturbing testimony about the harmful effects of 
increased testing on young children about class sizes of 33 
children in kindergarten programs and about the difficulties head 
start parents encounter as they seek to continue active involvement 
in their childs education in the public schools 
we were equally concerned about reports of low salaries for 
early childhood teachers staff turnover rates averaging 40 percent 
nationally in child care centers and limited uneven public funding 
for early childhood services said owens who is also president of 
nasbe 
early childhood units the task force said should aim to foster 
strong parentschool partnerships coordinate their services with 
other community agencies serving youngsters provide training and 
support for teachers and administrators and respect students 
cultural and linguistic diversity 
the report was the latest expression of concern over increased 
standardized testing ability tracking and rigid academic demands on 
elementary school children in some parts of the country 
similar concerns were raised in the past year by groups including 
the national association of elementary school principals and the 
national association for the education of young children 
the report didnt single out any states or districts for 
criticism but georgia for example now requires kindergartners to 
pass a test to advance to first grade as does minneapolis 
in many instances these tests lead to labeling children as 
failures at earlier and earlier ages rather than finding and 
building upon their strengths the report said 
it said the stress on academics and standardized testing means 
the nation expects too little of elementaryage children because 
using more appropriate methods and materials children can deal 
with richer and more sophisticated learning tasks than those 
dictated by worksheets and drillandpractice pedagogy

the soviet union has agreed to a joint 
venture with american jews for the opening of a jewish cultural 
center in moscow jewish sources said friday 
details of the project will be discussed next week in moscow 
between soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and edgar 
bronfman president of the world jewish congress the sources said 
the decision which contrasts sharply with decades of official 
repression of jewish cultural and religious life reflects the 
widesweeping changes undertaken by president mikhail s gorbachev in 
the soviet society and economy 
until recently the teaching of hebrew and practice of jewish 
culture often resulted in jail terms on trumpedup charges ranging 
from antisoviet propaganda to drug possession 
an understanding in principle on the cultural center was reached 
last may in talks bronfman held with soviet officials including 
shevardnadze and konstantin kharchev chairman of the state 
committee on religious affairs said the sources 
the soviets have given the green light for this joint 
venture said one source who declined to be further identified 
what remains to be discussed are the funding and exact location of 
the center he said 
the center will include a library museum and rooms for 
celebration of weddings bar mitzvahs and other religious 
ceremonies the sources said 
if the moscow project is successful similar centers will be 
opened in kiev and other soviet cities they said 
the center will be run by soviet american and european jewish 
groups in a building supplied by the government the sources said 
the handful of synagogues allowed to operate in the soviet union 
are run by the state under close supervision 
the agreement is the latest in a series of changes affecting the 
lives of the estimated 25 million jews living in the soviet union 
authorities allowed some 12000 jews to emigrate this year up from 
the 8700 allowed to leave last year and a significant increase over 
the estimated 900 exit visas granted in 1986 
the easing of restrictions also has affected other ethnic and 
religious minorities who are enjoying greater freedom under 
gorbachev 
the changes also have extended to soviet relations with israel 
which moscow cut off in 1967 an official soviet delegation went to 
israel last year and an israeli consular team is in moscow now

charles s robb marine lbjs soninlaw 
twoterm governor is still expected to run away with the us 
senate election in virginia but his allamerican image has been 
battered by attacks from his republican opponent 
maurice a dawkins a 67yearold black lobbyist and retired 
minister has bruised robb with questions about associating with 
alleged cocaineusers and about a state gambling investigation 
for the governor of virginia to permit cocaine dealers and 
cocaine users to carry on under his nose well its not wisdom 
its arrogance dawkins said at a campaign debate 
robb often mentioned as a future presidential candidate accused 
dawkins of using character assassination of the basest sort 
the level of nastiness in the campaign is unprecedented in 
virginia where political high spirits usually are leavened by 
patrician gentility 
both candidates have been diminished even the likely landslide 
winner said larry sabato a university of virginia political 
scientist 
but robbs problems do not end with dawkins attacks from the 
right on the other side jesse jackson forces were angry at him for 
not backing jacksons presidential bid and for suggesting that the 
civil rights leader play a limited role in the presidential 
campaign jackson won the states presidential primary in march 
robbs nomination was likened to a coronation a handsome former 
marine corps officer he was known only as former president lyndon 
johnsons soninlaw when he ran for lieutenant governor in 1977 
but four years later he led a sweep of democrats into the states 
top three offices ending 12 years of gop rule he would be 
virginias first democratic senator since 1972 
dawkins meanwhile has raised a relatively tiny amount to 
finance his campaign has laid off all but one staff member and 
blames his troubles on racism and the news media 
dawkins was the last of four republicans to seek the nomination 
and his victory at the state gop convention in june was seen by some 
party leaders as a token gesture to steal the thunder of virginia 
democrats who are expected to nominate lt gov l douglas wilder 
another black for governor next year 
dawkins only other political race was an unsuccessful bid for 
the gop nomination for lieutenant governor in 1985 
robb has a strong record of fiscal soundness to please 
conservatives he appeals to moderates for opening positions of 
power in state government to blacks and women 
he has used his big lead in the polls to take some potentially 
unpopular stands including possible support for a tax increase to 
control the deficit 
dont expect me to do everything that you are going to think is 
in your shortterm interest robb said assume im serious 
enough about solving some of the problems that whatever your 
favorite program is i dont care what it is think of that as being 
in peril 
at the start of the senate campaign robb was the target of a 
noisy demonstration staged by jackson supporters at the state 
democratic convention 
more troubles followed by labor day robb was fielding questions 
about published reports that while governor he attended parties in 
virginia beach where cocaine was used 
a subsequent story said robbs social ties to people who were 
targets in a police investigation of illegal gambling hampered 
investigators who allegedly were told not to mention robb in their 
official reports 
robb has denied seeing anyone use cocaine and said he did not 
interfere in the gambling investigation but the allegations gave 
dawkins ammunition to question robbs judgment 
dawkins also has accused robb of having a plantation mentality 
toward blacks and has urged black voters to try the gop for a change 
while robbs image has suffered campaign polls this fall show 
his support ranging from 56 percent to 66 percent dawkins 
meantime has drawn from 12 percent to 19 percent 
robb with 27 million in fundraising has continued to 
campaign as if the election were tight dawkins has raised less than 
200000 and stopped campaigning for almost two weeks this fall to 
devote more time to seeking money 
at a news conference last week dawkins blamed the press and to 
some extent racism for his troubles he then walked out refusing 
to answer questions 
dawkins campaign has redefined what a political disaster is 
said sabato 
but the cocaine party and gambling probe stories have tarnished 
robbs squeakyclean image and could affect any ambitions he has for 
higher office sabato said 
you never say never but i think hes certainly been damaged 
sabato said i think hes been hurt

airliners testing new collision avoidance 
systems sometimes have been unable to tell the difference between an 
oncoming plane and a navy ship sitting in the water below a federal 
aviation administration official said friday 
the problem is with electronic signals being sent out by navy

avoidance and data systems branch 
despite the testing difficulties however fee said the problem 
can be corrected before mandatory traffic alert and collision 
avoidance systems are installed on all larger us passenger 
aircraft beginning late next year 
the systems which are designed to automatically alert pilots 
when another plane is near will be required on all planes carrying 
more than 30 passengers in the united states by the end of 1991 the 
system reads signals from transponders aboard other aircraft and is 
designed to supplement not replace air traffic control systems on

more than 1000 british travel agents have pulled 
out of a tourism convention in jerusalem after receiving protests 
and a boycott threat from palestine liberation organization a 
spokesman said friday 
about 3000 delegates had been expected at the fourday 
convention of the association of british travel agents opening 
monday but just under 1700 have registered said association 
spokesman martin symington 
the plos london office sent letters to all prospective delegates 
appealing to them to stay away and threatened to mobilize 2 million 
moslems in britain into boycotting travel companies that attended 
we do not take lightly attempts to belittle or ignore the 
sufferings of our people the plo letter said referring to the 
11monthold palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
jerusalem consists of a jewish sector and an arab sector annexed 
after israel captured it in the 1967 mideast war most western 
governments do not recognize it as the capital 
the convention was to have been held in torremolinos but the 
venue was switched because a new convention center in the spanish 
resort had not been completed symington said 
its obviously disappointing that there are fewer people 
attending this year symington said 
we understood the reasons for delegates not going as there have 
been problems of a political nature he said but jerusalem was 
the only place which met our convention requirements when we had to 
change venues 
to have pulled out would have been a political gesture and we 
are an apolitical body

if flying in an airplane makes you unbearably 
dizzy david barlow will spin you in a chair until the room dances 
if a subway ride makes your heart race hell give you coffee to 
simulate the sensation of panic until you overcome it 
barlow a psychologist who teaches at the state university of new 
york at albany was among the 420 experts and phobics gathered 
friday for a weekend convention on the fear of fear itself also 
known as anxiety attacks 
the objective of the ninth national conference and training 
institute on phobias and related anxiety disorders is to find a 
salve for discomfort widely suffered but not entirely understood 
barlow knows of what he speaks about 10 years ago he was under 
the stress of a new job when he panicked at giving a speech he 
cured himself by jogging and orating at the same time to simulate 
and overcome the breathlessness of sudden anxiety 
he developed this technique into a treatment in which the 
physical sensations of anxiety and panic are recreated based on the 
theory that people who suffer anxiety attacks are hypersensitive to 
their bodily reactions as a consequence these people monitor 
themselves vigilantly waiting for another panic attack when 
attacks occur an interior dialogue rages is this pounding heart 
just a healthy muscle or is it the irrational foreboding of some 
unknown disaster 
patients at barlows clinic are taught to reinforce rational 
thoughts over the irrational fears 
estimates of how many americans suffer from crippling anxiety and 
phobias range from 2 million to 12 million according to the 
national institute of mental health 
anxiety attacks were believed for a long time to be a heart 
condition now psychologists recognize that these experiences can 
lead to phobias irrational excessive and persistent fears 
phobias focus on specific situations that cause anxiety such as 
flying subways crowds or driving there is the dizzying panic of 
vertigo that can strike on a mountainside or an escalator or the 
loss of voice at having to speak in public the no 1 fear 
according to jerilyn ross president of the rockville mdbased 
phobia society of america 
her organization is sponsoring the convention with massachusetts 
general hospital and harvard medical school 
the most devastating phobia is agoraphobia a fear of being in 
public seeking to avoid the panic attacks that come when they are 
among others agoraphobics shun society sometimes keeping to their 
homes for decades only since the 1970s has serious attention been 
paid to finding ways to relieve it 
treatments for anxiety and severe phobia include gradually 
exposing the patient to the experience they fear teaching them 
breathing exercises to reduce the hyperventilation related to panic 
attacks and sedatives 
women suffering from anxiety often retreat into depression for 
men alcohol often is a way to cope studies show that 50 percent to 
60 percent of alcoholic men began drinking to soothe anxiety barlow 
said 
one of the convention participants is lisa d a 33yearold 
lawyer who once felt the only secure place in the world was her 
bedroom it began when she was 17 and her stepfather abandoned the 
family one day the industrious gregarious student panicked on a 
ride to the beach 
it was just the most uncomfortable frightening feeling a 
feeling like youre short of breath shaking all over a sense that 
youre just going to lose control time freezes and speeds up at the 
same time and you just want to get to a safe place recalled lisa 
soon it became difficult to drive a car or even walk down the 
street 
she fought back and got herself to the university of maryland 
where a full life there distracted her but three years ago with 
her career under way lisa began panicking again by then she had 
read about agoraphobia and knew what was wrong lisa called a hot 
line and was referred to a clinic for phobics 
although the attacks have ceased lisa is not entirely free she 
said i dont think ill ever be 100 percent comfortable about it 
but im able to say im not avoiding life because of it

president reagan outlined his unfinished 
foreign policy agenda today saying his successor should maintain a 
strong defense support the contra rebels and pursue the strategic 
defense initiative 
in remarks prepared for delivery to the world affairs council a 
nonpartisan foreign study group reagan said those steps were 
essential to safeguard america and western civilization from the 
worlds archvillians 
but reagan also predicted that if his course of peace through 
strength is maintained a new strategic arms accord with the 
soviet union is attainable in the next few years 
the president while boasting of the improvement in ussoviet 
relations that brought forth a treaty banning an entire class of 
nuclear weapons during his administration said much work will be 
left to his successor 
responsibililty he said also falls on the voters who on nov 8 
will make decisions that will affect the world and our foreign 
policy consensus for a great long time to come 
reagan did not mention vice president george bush the gop 
candidate or his rival democrat michael dukakis by name 
whatever the future may hold it is safe to say we have come a 
long way and this is a portentous time reagan said 
let us remember that great steps have been taken in the last 
few years steps to safeguard against archvillains not to mention 
the blowing up of the world of course let us not be satisfied and 
certainly not smug but let us be appreciative of what has happend 
and determined to build on that progress reagan said 
change indeed is inevitable reagan said no one should 
doubt the instability of the present situation in eastern europe in 
which an artificial economic and political system long imposed on 
these people against their will is more and more exposed as 
bankrupt and discredited 
calling the new degree of tolerance and experimentation under 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev welcome reagan also said that 
moscows handling of the growing drive for selfdetermination 
within its european empire will be a vital test for us of how deep 
is the transformation of soviet foreign policy in a new era 
he said the united states should hold to a strategy that means 
not only maintaining our defenses and vigorous diplomatic 
engagement but also candor about and to our adversaries support 
for freedom fighters around the globe and encouragement of human 
rights and democratic reforms within the eastern bloc 
the president called on congress to give up the double 
standard of supporting freedom fighters in one part of the globe 
and not another we must support the contras in nicaragua he 
said 
on his spacebased nuclear missile defense plan known as sdi 
reagan said we must aggressively pursue the research development 
and testing 
now is the time to redouble our efforts not cut them back 
he said congress in the current fiscal budget has mandated cuts 
in the presidents requests for the program 
on the nations defenses reagan said we must keep our entire 
defense structure strong arguing that the enormous sacrifices 
that have been made to rebuild the military have only begun to pay 
handsome dividends in peace initiatives across the globe 
reagans foreign policy speech came as he made his last 
preelection swing through his home state where he was attempting 
to enlist california and its bounty of 47 electoral votes for 
republican presidential nominee george bush

nato defense ministers ended talks 
friday with a call for modernizing shortrange nuclear weapons but 
belgium refused to endorse a report laying out proposals for the 
program 
i see no hesitation said us defense secretary frank 
carlucci we are going ahead on a stepbystep basis toward 
modernization 
however belgian defense minister guy coeme told reporters that 
his nations centerleft coalition government abstained from 
endorsing the ministers report on shortrange weapons 
assuming any commitment now would be premature he said 
the issue is controversial in europe where the frontline 
weapons would likely be targeted in a conflict 
despite belgiums abstention on the report carlucci and the 
other defense chiefs of the north atlantic treaty organization said 
friday in their final statement that the alliance needed the 
shortrange nuclear arms in its arsenal their statement made no 
mention of belgiums hesitation 
the shortrange weapons have received new attention since the 
united states and soviet union signed a treaty in december to 
eliminate all intermediaterange landbased nuclear missiles 
most nato nations want to extend the range of shortrange or 
tactical weapons up to the treaty limit of 300 miles 
for the foreseeable future nato requires diversified 
survivable and operationally flexible nuclear forces in europe 
across the entire spectrum of ranges the ministers said at the 
end of their twoday talks at the hague 
nato secretary general manfred woerner said the ministers made no 
decisions on specific weapons systems this week 
british defense minister george younger said such decisions will 
be taken as early as next year 
the ministers secret report prepared earlier by their staffs 
calls for a new longer range airtosurface missile that could be 
fired at soviet air defenses from a nato warplane it also backs 
us work on replacing the lance surfacetosurface missile which 
military analysts say will be obsolete in 1995 
details of the report became known when the londonbased campaign 
for nuclear disarmament released a summary prepared by the belgian 
defense ministry 
the defense chiefs meet twice a year to plan nuclear strategy

a poll published friday said liberal party leader 
john turner won the two campaign debates in which he and prime 
minister brian mulroney had angry exchanges about the new 
uscanadian trade agreement 
the agreement scheduled to take effect jan 1 has become the 
dominant issue in the nov 21 general election it would phase out 
all remaining tariffs over a 10year period and turner said it 
will reduce us to a colony of the united states 
ed broadbent of the socialist new democratic party joined turner 
and the conservative prime minister in the six hours of televised 
debates the first half in french on monday and the second in 
english the next evening 
broadbent also opposes the trade agreement 
according to the poll conducted by environics and published by 
the independent globe and mail of toronto 46 percent of those 
familiar with the debates said turner won 19 percent chose mulroney 
and 10 percent favored broadbent 
free trade was judged the most important election issue by 76 
percent of those surveyed environics said the poll was based on 811 
interviews and the margin of error was 34 percent 
a gallup poll that covered only tuesday nights debate published 
by the toronto star had 72 percent favoring turner 17 percent for 
mulroney and 11 deciding broadbent won 
the last gallup poll before the debates found 40 percent for the 
conservatives the new democrats in second with 29 percent and the 
liberals with 28 percent 
that outcome probably would give mulroney a parliamentary 
majority 
on thursday mulroney said his rivals were being shameful and 
dishonest in their attacks on the trade agreement 
turner whose party has been a dominant force in canadian 
government through much of this century said in the debate the 
agreement reverses 120 years canadian of resistance to us pressure

the french drug ru 486 blocks pregnancy after 
conception by interfering with a hormone that is essential to the 
maintenance of pregnancy 
the hormone progesterone is secreted normally during the latter 
half of the menstrual period said dr irving spitz the director of 
clinical research at the population council in new york who is 
studying the drug 
one of the major effects of progesterone is to mature the 
lining of the uterus so the egg can be implanted he said in a 
telephone interview 
researchers had been searching for such a drug for more than two 
decades spitz said this is the first drug to be found that could 
actually block the action of progesterone he said 
when progesterones action is blocked the uterus sheds its 
lining any egg that might have been fertilized and implanted in 
that lining is shed along with the uterine lining 
ru 486 itself terminates pregnancy in about 75 percent of women 
who use it during the first six weeks of pregnancy spitz said to 
boost the drugs effectiveness doctors also prescribe a 
prostaglandin one of a group of hormone and hormonelike chemicals 
in the body 
the prostaglandin causes uterine contractions the combination of 
ru 486 and the prostaglandin is effective in about 95 percent of 
women during the first six weeks of pregnancy spitz said 
the drugs manufacturer recommends that it be taken in one dose 
followed three days later by a dose of prostaglandin spitz said in 
france the drug is given only at abortion clinics so that doctors 
can monitor its effectiveness the drug is not available over the 
counter 
doctors will want to counsel the 5 percent of women in whom the 
drug is not effective he said and some women who take it will 
bleed excessively 
the entire process of terminating pregnancy is usually complete 
in seven to 14 days spitz said 
spitz said he is not aware that anyone in the united states has 
taken steps to market the drug to do so a company would be 
required to file a new drug application with the us food and drug 
administration 
it would likely take at least several years before such an 
application would be approved spitz said 
hoechst roussel pharmaceuticals in somerville nj which is 
affiliated with the drugs french manufacturer roussel uclaf said 
friday it had no plans to study or market the drug 
gynopharma inc also of somerville had been rumored to be 
negotiating to market the drug in the united states it has since 
denied that it has plans to do so 
laura giles spokeswoman for gynopharma said friday that the 
company has not negotiated with roussel uclaf and is not petitioning 
the fda to allow marketing of the drug 
spitz said that ru 486 blocks progesterone by interfering with 
progesterone receptors on cells in the uterus 
it works very similar to a lock and key he explained all 
hormones work on receptors the receptor is the lock the hormone is 
the key 
the drug causes nausea and vomiting in 13 percent or 14 percent 
of women who use it he said it sometimes causes bleeding and pain 
as well but those are normal accompaniments of the abortion 
process spitz said

for most of the 45 americans present 
fridays ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the departure of 
the international brigades from the battlefields of the spanish 
civil war was the last hurrah 
its probably the last watershed when such a gathering could be 
held said steve w nelson of truro mass the 85yearold 
commander of the abraham lincoln brigade of us volunteers who 
fought on the side of the spanish republic in the 193639 civil war 
the unveiling of a bronze sculpture of david looking down at 
goliath by new york artist roy shifrin was the centerpiece of a 
ceremony presided by barcelonas socialist mayor pasqual maragall in 
honor of the oct 28 1938 departure of international brigades 
veterans from the conflict that many saw as a prelude to world war 
ii 
about 300 former brigades members from 20 countries attended the 
ceremony 
the monument and the cost of the ceremony were underwritten by 
contributions from among others pete seeger ed asner allen 
ginsberg leonard bernstein greogory peck woody allen harry 
belafonte studs terkel kurt vonnegut and gloria steinem the city 
of barcelona provided the land 
as the barcelona city band played nelson said the sculpture was 
a symbol for the people to recall the great struggle of the 
international brigades who helped to delay a major part of the 
second world war 
the brigades were the idea of the comintern or third communist 
international to provide support for the second spanish republic 
following the nationalist rebellion of gen francisco franco in july 
1936 
francos troops received men and materiel from nazi germany and 
italy 
historians estimate 35000 to 50000 volunteers many with no 
formal connections to the comintern fought on the losing side 
defending the second republic in the war that ended with a victory 
by the franco forces in april 1939 and a subsequent 36year 
dictatorship 
nelson said of the 3000 americans who fought on spanish 
battlefields some 300 are alive today in the united states another 
800 died in the war 
bob reed 73 of seattle marched in the oct 28 farewell parade 
50 years ago in barcelona 
that was really a magnificent display of feelings he said 
the people were giving us flowers the kids were riding on the 
shoulders of the brigade members it gave us a feeling of not losing 
the war but of coming out with renewed determination 
civil war historian hugh thomas says soviet dictator josef stalin 
decided to withdraw the brigades from spain when he despaired of 
being unable to form an alliance with france and britain against 
hitler following british prime minister neville chamberlains trip 
to munich in september 1938 
the withdrawal of the brigades was a gesture of goodwill toward 
nazi germany that led to the signing of a nonagression pact between 
the two nations a year later 
gabriel jackson professor emeritus of history at the university 
of california at san diego told the us veterans veterans that for 
the surviving members of the international brigades the restoration 
of democracy in spain after francos death in 1975 was like a 
victory 40 years later 
none of us would have believed there could have been a change 
to democracy without another bloody revolution in spain said 
mosess fishman 75 of new york 
oct 28 is also the sixth anniversary of the 1982 landslide 
victory that swept the socialists to power in spain in general 
elections for the first time since the outbreak of the civil war 
steve nelson said much of the 1950s mccarthyera backlash against 
the lincoln battalion veterans 60 percent of whom were either 
members of the communist party or sympathizers he said had 
subsided 
young people are fascinated by the subject there isnt a day 
goes by at our new york office that we dont get calls or letters 
from students or other people writing books about the subject he 
said 
bob reed took advantage of the visit to continue his trip into 
the past to the fishing village of malgrat de mar on the 
mediterranean coast where the troop ship carrying him to spain in 
1937 was sunk a mile offshore by an italian submarine 
we went there cold reed said but a young lady at the 
tourist office was delighted to meet people she had read about in 
history books 
reed and several other survivors met with the mayor and 
discovered that the bodies of six victims of the wreck including 
possibly an american were buried in the malgrat de mar cemetery

democrat michael dukakis derided george bush 
as hiding in his little cocoon on friday and defended his own 
ridiculed ride in an army tank saying the reagan administration was 
trying to cut tank production 
dukakis has been interviewed on a series of network television 
programs recently as he tries to make up ground in the polls and he 
accused his republican rival of avoiding such encounters as the 
election nears 
mr bush is out there in his little cocoon they wont let him 
out dukakis said were taking our case directly to the 
american people 
dukakis displayed a battlingback demeanor at a large and raucus 
rally at a college outside detroit just a few miles from his sept 
13 ride in an abrams m1 tank that ride has been mocked in 
television commercials by bush 
let me tell you why i was in that tank factory dukakis said 
at the rally in the crowded fieldhouse at macomb community college 
i care about those people i care about what theyre making 
the democratic presidential nominee said im deeply concerned 
about this administrations plans to cut back on tank production 
while spending billions and trillions on star wars 
dukakis also jabbed at bush for a remark the vice president made 
while watching soviet tank maneuvers in europe 
i am very concerned dukaks said when a vice president of 
the united states who wants to be president comes back from europe

president augusto pinochet said marxists are 
regaining strength and likened the nations political situation to 
the days before his military coup 15 years ago 
the rightwing army general went on the political offensive for 
the first time since he lost an oct 5 referendum to extend his term 
until 1997 
the situation we find ourselves in is without doubt delicate 
pinochet told about 800 supporters thursday night in this provincial 
city it would be fatal and insincere to try to hide it 
i see with much concern that the same political formulas that 
in the past dragged the country into an unprecedented crisis are now 
returning pinochet said whats even more serious is that they 
are promoted by the same people who destroyed our fatherland our 
democracy just 15 years ago 
pinochet led a september 1973 coup that toppled the elected 
government of president salvador allende a marxist during 
widespread economic and social disorder allende died in the coup 
the causes of the confrontation of chilean against chilean 
cannot be allowed to repeat themselves pinochet said we have 
to realize the dangerous time in which we live and call on 
patriotism to overcome this situation 
he said the twin dangers were growing terrorism and 
marxistleninism 
gabriel valdes a leader of the centrist christian democrats the 
countrys largest party discounted pinochets remarks as a sign he 
remains in shock from the referendums outcome he continues 
to be wounded by the defeat valdes told reporters in santiago on 
friday 
other opposition leaders however have said a hard line by 
pinochet is designed to provoke street demonstrations or other 
opposition that could be used in an effort to justify repression 
in the referendum chileans rejected a proposal by pinochet and 
the other military commanders that he remain in power until 1997 
about 55 percent voted no and 43 percent voted yes with the 
remainder of votes voided 
on this weeks tour pinochet said the vote showed the good faith 
of his military regime and allowed a reaffirmation of the 
eightyearold constitution 
under that document the defeat forces pinochet to call an open 
election planned for december 1989 and hand power over to the 
winner in march 1990 
pinochet has pledged to turn over power but he had not 
explicitly said he would not run himself 
the opposition is pressing for constitutional changes including 
a quicker departure of pinochet from the presidency they say some 
amendments are also needed to ensure full democratic powers for a 
future elected government

the hospitalization of police cadets from a state 
academy exposed a brutal training regimen hidden from public 
scrutiny despite many warning signs but no one will be prosecuted 
the state attorney general said friday 
attorney general james shannon said his investigation found a 
toptobottom failure by the state to protect the cadets most 
of them from smalltown police departments 
he said he could find no statute under which to press charges 
that there was no evidence of intent by state police trainers to 
harm the cadets and that the diffusion of responsibility made it 
unfair to prosecute individuals 
but shannon said the chief of the agency responsible for the boot 
camplike training should resign or be dismissed 
the failure began with a bureaucracy that paid little or no 
attention to the end product of its papershuffling the care and 
training of human beings shannon concluded 
instead like the three monkeys of the legend and despite the 
existence of cause for alarm the training bureaucracy saw no evil 
heard no evil and spoke no evil 
the investigation was limited to one class of the police training 
academy in agawam in western massachusetts one of 11 operated by 
the state criminal justice training council the class which began 
sept 19 included 50 cadets from local police forces seeking 
certification as fullfledged police officers 
the academy and its methods came under scrutiny when cadet 
timothy shepard collapsed slipped into a coma and had to undergo a 
liver transplant at a pittsburgh hospital where he has regained 
consciousness but remains unable to speak 
at least 10 other cadets were hospitalized for ills stemming from 
intense exercise and dehydration the report said one cadet was 
quoted by the attorney general as saying his urine was as brown as 
hersheys syrup 
according to a springfield doctor who coordinated the medical 
response at least 16 cadets were admitted to hospitals 
shannons report documents a grueling regimen of modified 
stress training and unrelenting exercise defended by academy 
officials as necessary to prepare for the rigors of police work 
when a cadet failed to keep up the entire class would be punished 
with extra pushups or other exercises 
i expressly reject the contention that exercising cadets 
until they drop can meaningfully be termed training shannon 
wrote 
shannon said at a news conference that the officials involved 
should have known there were problems at the academy 
according to the report agawam fire department records show 12 
ambulance runs to the academy from 1984 to this year to assist 
trainees eleven calls required taking a cadet to a hospital that 
should have indicated a problem shannon said 
he said responsibility belonged with the state troopers who 
conducted the class the directors of the academy and the 23member 
criminal justice training council of which he is a member 
shannon told reporters that he did not believe gov michael s 
dukakis who appoints the council bore any blame 
he said gary egan the councils executive director who took a 
paid leave of absence starting wednesday should either resign or 
be removed immediately egans phone number in wellesley is 
unlisted 
shannon did not spell out how he thinks training should be 
conducted saying he hoped that issue would be addressed by separate 
investigations being conducted by the legislature and the governors 
office 
his report detailed the physical training that took up most of 
the first day of a class in february as an example a videotape made 
that day documents 2 hours of morning training showing that the 
group performed 188 pushups and that some cadets did more as 
punishment 
investigators noted that most cadets had just two water breaks 
during the day taking a single 3ounce cup of water

the federal aviation administration presented a 
detailed timetable friday for acting on 100 measures to improve 
operations and reduce trafficcontrol errors at chicagos busy 
ohare international airport 
the lengthy document was submitted to sen paul simon dill 
who had criticized the agency two days earlier for sending congress 
a vague and inadequate report on plans for the nations busiest 
airport 
simon met with faa officials to discuss their latest report and 
then told reporters he was satisfied with the agencys efforts 
this action plan we now have really means the beginning of the 
end of a significant threat to air safety at ohare simon said 
concrete actions are going to be followed we have dates we have 
specifics 
the senate passed a resolution earlier this month instructing the 
faa to submit a detailed report on its immediate and longrange 
plans to end what simon called an airtraffic control crisis at 
ohare 
its controllers have had 30 flighthandling errors so far this 
year compared with 12 in all of 1987 and their previous record of 
22 in 1986 
the faa report listed 100 specific measures to improve safety and 
operations at ohare ranging from hiring additional journeyman or 
fullperformancelevel controllers to repainting the lines on 
runways to make them more visible 
it said a program approved thursday by the office of personnel 
management providing a 20 percent pay increase to employees at 
hardtostaff facilities in three metropolitan areas chicago new 
york and los angeles should more than double the number of 
experienced controllers at ohare by may 1 
the control tower now has 32 journeyman controllers compared 
with the faas goal of 72 staff reassignments will add five 
fullperformance controllers to the ohare tower by nov 20 and 
eight by jan 20 simon said 
some of the measures such as limiting radio conversations between 
pilots and the tower will occur immediately while others will begin 
next year 
the plan also calls for additional staff training runway 
improvements upgrading equipment and by 1993 building a new 
control tower at ohare 
the faa did not estimate the cost of implementing the various 
measures but simon said the agency believes enough money is 
available in its current budget to cover most of the improvements 
planned during the year

the occupational safety and health 
administration on friday slapped a record 433 million fine on john 
morrell amp co saying the meatpacker forced hundreds of injured 
employees at its plant in sioux falls sd to keep working even 
immediately after surgery 
the fine the largest against a single employer in the agencys 
17year history reflects what assistant labor secretary john a 
pendergrass called an employer who knew about a serious health 
hazard saw the tragic toll on its workers and chose to ignore it 
morrell the nations fifth largest meatpacker said it would 
seek an injunction on monday in us district court in sioux falls 
to stop osha from singling us out for penalties for what is 
clearly a national multiindustry safety and health problem 
pendergrass however said an osha inspection of the giant plant 
begun six months ago uncovered the worst conditions weve found in 
any industry to date 
morrell chairman milton j schloss called the fine grossly 
unfair and totally unjustified 
this is guilt by headline schloss said from the companys 
headquarters in cincinnati it clearly is unfair for osha to 
single us out and demand we do more when we already are leading the 
industry in this effort 
the fines all stem from what is increasingly recognized as 
cumulative trauma disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome and 
tendinitis in which joints become incapable of movement because of 
repeated hand wrist and arm motions that wear away soft tissue 
protecting them 
osha has levied fines in the past against companies that ignore 
the disorder including some against auto producers and a 31 
million penalty against another meatpacker ibp corp last may 
ibp the nations second largest meatpacker has appealed its 
fine which stemmed from working conditions that the agency found at 
its dakota city neb plant 
but nowhere osha officials said friday have government 
investigators found such widespread evidence of the disorders and 
such willful disregard for those injured as at morrells sioux falls 
plant 
from may 1987 to may 1988 more than 800 of the 2000 workers at 
the plant sustained serious and sometimes disabling injuries 
osha said 
and some departments in the plant had incidence rates of 75 
injured workers for every 100 fulltime employees 
the government said morrells rate of injuries was nine times the 
average for the meatpacking industry the most hazardous in the 
country according to the bureau of labor statistics and 652 times 
the rate of job injuries for businesses in general 
of the 817 morrell workers at sioux falls 93 percent received no 
time off and 39 percent were denied lighter duty needed for healing 
osha said 
sixtythree morrell workers who underwent surgery received an 
average of only 11 days off compared with 30 days to 60 days 
recommended by the national institute of occupational safety and 
health for recovery before returning to the job 
osha said it found 27 workers who underwent surgery who received 
no time off 
there were indications that recommendations of physicians were 
totally ignored pendergrass said 
fridays action was the latest in a string of fines levied 
against the sioux falls plant from 1984 through september morrell 
has been fined six times by the agency for a total of 758910 for 
violations at the facility 
frank white oshas top enforcement officer said morrell had 
hired ergonomists experts in designing work stations to avoid 
stress and trauma in 1986 and last april to study the problem 
but white added we have no clear evidence at this point that 
any changes have been made he added however the government 
inspectors have not been inside the plant in recent months 
schloss cited a ruling by a labor department law judge last week 
dismissing a 690100 fined assessed against the company in april 
1987 for what osha called deliberate falsification of its health and 
safety records 
the law judge james a cronin jr said osha had missed a 
sixmonth statute of limitations for writing the citations from the 
time that the agency first told the company that it wanted to 
inspect the records 
morrell said in a statement that union work rules and the 
grievance process have often been used to block changes in 
workers routines designed to alleviate the problems of 
repetitivemotion duties 
but al zack a spokesman for the united food and commercial 
workers that represents the morrell employees said the rotation 
system morrell cited was proposed and rejected five years go 
it was a costcutting scheme to cut wages and had absolutely 
nothing to do with safety zack said 
previously the largest fine assessed against one employer was a 
411 million levy in 1987 against bath iron works of maine 
primarily for construction safety violations 
osha and the company last week agreed to a 650000 settlement 
with bath iron works agreeing to institute a companywide program to 
end the dangerous conditions and finance health and safety research

zambians voted overwhelmingly to give 
president kenneth kaunda the nations founding father another 
fiveyear term in office according to results released friday 
while the final outcome of wednesdays presidential and 
parliamentary elections are not expected until late saturday kaunda 
captured 936 percent of the ballots counted so far officials said 
the results were from 90 of the 125 constituencies 
kaunda 64 who led the former british colony of northern 
rhodesia to independence as zambia oct 24 1964 was the only 
presidential candidate voters marked an eagle if they supported 
kaunda and a frog if they opposed him 
also up for election were the 125 seats in the national assembly 
there were 609 candidates for the seats 
despite zambias severe economic problems kaunda has remained 
popular and has served five terms most zambians believe he has done 
well in keeping their country free of civil strife that plagues 
other african nations 
one of the first tasks confronting him is the nations 5 billion 
foreign debt which saps 40 percent of export income 
the massive yes vote arms him with a mandate to carry out 
economic reforms needed to check inflation record unemployment and 
rising urban crime 
key ministers were reelected strengthening kaundas hand in 
seeking badly needed economic reforms 
prime minister kebby musokotwane held on to his constituency and 
is expected to remain premier in the new cabinet 
kaunda is unlikely to make any statement on the polling trend 
until after the final results are announced saturday aides said 
he needed a simple majority of the ballots cast to remain in 
power or twothirds of the total registered voters support zambia 
has 26 million registered voters

foes of the planned partial merger of detroits 
two daily newspapers argued in court friday that neither the papers 
circulation nor advertising revenues were in the classic downward 
spiral that warrants merging business and production operations 
at issue before a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of 
appeals was whether thenattorney general edwin meese iii properly 
gave the detroit free press and the detroit news permission to form 
a joint operating agreement 
the decision meese made before leaving office last summer has 
been stayed while under court challenge by a group of readers and 
advertisers 
the michigan group contends neither daily is a failing newspaper 
deserving of an antitrust exemption under the 1970 newspaper 
preservation act 
the free press owned by knightridder inc and the news 
purchased in 1986 by gannett co inc sought the joint operating 
agreement as a way to stem continuing losses by both newspapers 
since 1980 both have weekday circulations of more than 600000 
opponents attorney william b schultz said the only reason the 
two newspapers have lost money is their eightyear battle to put 
each other out of business by drastically cutting advertising and 
circulation rates 
on the day that they announced they were going to apply for the 
joa both papers stated that they had fought this competition to a 
virtual draw schultz said 
there was ample support for the operation of two newspapers 
in detroit he said 
it was true that the free press was losing money schultz 
said but its true that the news was losing almost as much 
knightridders attorney clark clifford argued that the free 
press is not a strong paper it is only what it is because in the 
last eight years or so knightridder has pumped in 176 million 
thats what kept it alive 
locked into this moneylosing competition there is nothing 
that the newspaper can do without violating the antitrust laws by 
calling up the news and say lets have a price increase said 
justice department attorney douglas letter 
meese accepted the administrative law judges factual findings 
but not the recommendation that he reject the partial merger meese 
concluded that if he denied the joa knightridder would carry out 
its threat to close the free press which has lost 100 million 
since 1980 
schultz said meese irrationally ignored the administrative law 
judges scenario that a rejection of the joint operating agreement 
would prompt the news and in turn the free press to raise their 
prices 
the administrative law judge predicted that both papers would 
then make money 
schultz said meese never explained why he ignored the 
administrative law judges rejection of testimony from gannett 
chairman allen h neuharth who vowed that the news would never 
raise its prices 
judge laurence silberman questioned whether the court could 
secondguess meeses reasonable prediction that if the joa is 
denied that the news will not raise its prices 
silberman said the administrative law judge essentially concluded 
that the free press is not quite on its knees while meese found 
that they havent waved a white flag yet but it looks like they 
are shot full of holes 
a lowercourt judge upheld meeses decision under which the two 
dailies would publish separate morning and evening newspapers but 
combine their advertising business and production facilities

two whales trapped for more than two weeks 
by encircling arctic ice apparently swam to freedom before daylight 
today after days of effort by eskimos and icebreakers an official 
said 
they were last seen at 845 am they were looking good 
north slope borough mayor george ahmaogak said after talking by 
radio to eskimos who had gone to open breathing holes for the 
whales the last sighting was about an hour before sunrise 
i feel great i feel like i got no more burden said arnold 
brower the senior whaling captin who directed the eskimo rescue 
efforts of cutting breathing holes in the ice with chain saws 
asked if he was confident the two california gray whales swam to 
freedom actually open channels in the ice leading to icefree water 
200 miles away rather than died brower replied yes a third 
whale disappeared a week ago and was presumed dead 
as night fell thursday in subzero temperatures rescuers had 
left the whales in a breathing hole just 330 yards from open water 
a distance that federal whale biologist david withrow called 
essentially one long dive 
twice wednesday the giant mammals traveled more than 300 yards 
under the ice to reach new breathing holes he said but they 
appeared reluctant to traverse the distance thursday 
the eskimos crews had gone out early today to cut additional 
holes to coax the animals toward the open water said ahmaogak 
the whales condition appeared worse after they struggled through 
the slush and ice left in the icebreakers wake wednesday night and 
thursday both bled from multiple but superficial cuts 
the soviet icebreaker vladimir arseniev and its companion ship 
the admiral makarov had remained nearby and offered to lend further 
assistance by cutting a second path through the ice off the northern 
alaska coast the ships then planned to depart for their home port 
of vladivostok 
rear adm sigmund petersen of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration said the soviet crews were ready to go 
home their ships had been at sea for nearly six months and were 
diverted for the last three days to assist the whalerescue effort 
were here until those whales depart from the area ron 
morris the rescue coordinator said before the whales disappeared 
early today he said that if it was evident the whales had reached 
open water then thats all were going to do the whales are 
on their own 
the whales were caught in the arctic ice for nearly three weeks 
by an early freeze halting their annual migration to their winter 
home off baja california 
the mammals plight triggered a massive rescue effort involving 
chain sawwielding eskimos and the soviet icebreakers that captured 
worldwide attention the effort has cost an estimated 13 million 
rescuers thought that after the icebreakers broke a channel to 
open water wednesday the whales would resume their migration but 
the pair lingered and parts of the channel refroze 
the eventual fate of the creatures may never be known because 
scientists turned down the option of attaching radio transmitters to 
them some rescuers said theyd rather not know what happens to them 
the temperature hovered at minus 15 degrees fahrenheit thursday 
night quickly refreezing escape channels cut by the arseniev the 
plunging temperatures also were beginning to put a glaze of ice on 
the open water to which rescuers were trying to lead the whales 
national weather service ice analyst gary hufford said the whales 
had shown an ability to break newly formed ice so he remained 
optimistic they could survive if they got beyond the remnants of the 
pressure ridge crushed earlier in the week by the soviet icebreakers 
when rescuers found the whales early thursday they were 
maintaining a small breathing hole about 1 miles from where they 
were last seen wednesday night 
concerned with the whales inability to negotiate the partially 
refrozen channel eskimo laborers cut more than three dozen new 
breathing holes in a path toward open water the whales followed 
dutifully and were resting in the last breathing hole when darkness 
fell 
the eskimos were prevented from moving further because the ice 
was unstable as a result of the icebreakers earlier efforts

about 5000 people defied 
authorities by rallying in historic wenceslas square on friday then 
shouted shame and gestapo at police who cleared them with 
clubs and water cannon 
powerful jets of water slashed indiscriminately into the crowd 
knocking some people over and sending others fleeing down side 
streets 
the state news agency ctk said 87 people were arrested western 
journalists saw police beating some of the demonstrators with clubs 
and plainclothes officers twisted the arms of others while leading 
them to police buses 
hundreds of police some with dogs on leashes swarmed through 
the plaza to disperse the thousands of all ages who assembled on the 
70th anniversary of czechoslovak independence to demand reform and 
greater freedom 
police fired tear gas into a crowd of several hundred people 
watching from the steps of the national museum overlooking the 
square which stretches for half a mile in central prague 
a cloud of tear gas billowed under a huge official poster on the 
museum proclaiming seventy years all power in the czechoslovak 
socialist republic belongs to the working people 
ctk said the disturbances only involved about 2000 people but 
said they also spread to the nearby old town square 
the actions of internal enemies of socialism and debased 
elements were prepared well ahead of time with the support of 
foreign antisocialist emigre centers and publicized by western 
media ctk said 
the aim of the confrontation was to cast doubts on official 
policies and to discredit czechoslovakia ctk said 
by early evening police trucks had moved off wenceslas square 
into nearby sidestreets there was a heavy presence of uniformed 
police throughout the city center 
fridays crowd defied a week of warnings from the communist 
authorities not to attend the rally called by the charter 77 human 
rights organization and four other independent groups 
the rally followed what dissident sources described as the most 
extensive roundups of dissidents in recent years in which at least 
70 were detained 
in washington state department spokesman phyllis oakley said 
the detentions show that czechoslovakia has far to go to bridge 
the chasm between the current practices of the authorities and the 
democratic ideals upon which the country was founded 
the rally ban and show of force appeared intended to prevent a 
protest similar to one of about 10000 people aug 21 the 
anniversary of the 1968 sovietled invasion that crushed the 
prague spring of liberal reform 
authorities reported 77 people detained after the august 
demonstration which riot police dispersed after several thousand 
people marched through prague demanding freedom and a withdrawal 
of the estimated 80000 soviet troops stationed in czechoslovakia 
chants of we want freedom and long live truth rose 
repeatedly from fridays crowd but there were none about the 
soviets 
in the 20 years since 1968 the communist party has been hard on 
dissent but kept supplies of consumer goods generous as a reward for 
political silence from most of the 155 million citizens 
current party leaders put in power by the kremlin after 1968 
have indicated they wont adopt the sweeping reforms being promoted 
in the soviet union by president mikhail s gorbachev 
roman catholic activists young people and independent peace 
campaigners have become increasingly active in recent months police 
in bratislava capital of slovakia used water cannons last march to 
disperse about 2000 activists who protested in a downtown square 
for more religious freedom 
on friday an estimated 5000 people gathered at the rallying 
hour of 3 pm many chanted masaryk in honor of thomas garrigue 
masaryk who founded democratic czechoslovakia and became its 
president masaryk is still held in esteem by citizens as is his 
slovak ally milan rastislav stefanik and president woodrow wilson 
who backed their campaign for independence 
when police gave the order to disperse they sang the national 
anthem 
derisive whistles and shouts of shame filled the air as the 
first group of about 30 helmeted police with clubs moved into the 
square 
ladislav lis a charter 77 activist appeared in the center of 
the square and cried out in the name of the movement for civil 
freedom hurrah the crowd roared support 
his reference was to a coalition of charter 77 and other groups 
organized recently which issued a list of 12 demands for more civil 
and political freedom signed by more than 120 prominent activists 
reporters could not see whether lis was detained in the ensuing 
melee the square was deserted after about 40 minutes except for 
dozens of police vehicles and patrolling officers 
riot police sealed the square off from side streets where groups 
of demonstrators could be heard chanting defiantly some shouting 
the world sees this 
those on the museum steps retreated toward the main railroad 
station where some still taunted police two hours later police 
sirens wailed through central prague 
the poster on the museum was part of the first official 
celebration in four decades of communist rule of democratic 
czechoslovakias founding oct 28 1918 
this year authorities proclaimed it a national holiday and held 
a mass official rally thursday in wenceslas square the official 
rally was scheduled for thursday to give citizens a threeday 
weekend 
a limited amnesty was declared under which the governments 
general prosecutor said about 7000 prisoners would be freed anna 
sabatova of the committee for the unjustly prosecuted said she 
believed only a handful of political prisoners would be among them

premier branko mikulic told leaders 
in emergency session friday that the economy must soon undergo a 
radical marketoriented overhaul the official news ageny tanjug 
said 
he also proposed unspecified social programs to dampen possible 
increase of social tensions as a result of the reforms which call 
for closing unprofitable enterprises tanjug reported 
raif dizdarevic head of the nations collective presidency 
warned the officials earlier friday that yugoslavia is facing its 
final hour to put the economic changes into effect 
political and ethnic tensions have increased to such a degree 
that both the political and security situation have seriously 
deteriorated he said 
they were addressing a rare emergency meeting between the cabinet 
and the countrys ninemember collective presidency called to 
discuss a deepening economic crisis and resulting social strife 
only two such emergency meetings have been held since world war ii 
in 1981 and 1985 
economic and ethnic problems have combined to prompt months of 
demonstrations with calls for an overhaul of the communist 
leadership and introduction of a multiparty system the strife has 
led to the ouster of party leaders in one of two autonomous national 
provinces 
mikulic said the government will introduce fundamental 
marketoriented economic reform beginning next year to fight rampant 
inflation and growing labor unrest 
deputy premier janez zemljaric said at the meeting that 
yugoslavias annual inflation rate touched an alltime annual record 
of 236 percent in october unemployment stands at about 15 percent 
the new economic system calls for closing down all unprofitable 
enterprises widely introducing private domestic and foreign capital 
investments and floating stocks and bonds 
yugoslavias current economy mixes central planning and local 
worker control about half of the countrys companies are reported 
to be losing money and layoffs could fuel more social unrest 
in addition to hundreds of strikes the country has faced serbian 
nationalist demonstrations that have aggravated tension between 
serbs and other groups in this fragile federation of six republics 
and two provinces 
press reports have speculated on the possibility of an army 
takeover to quell the dissent 
however mikulic on friday dismissed talk of an imminent 
military coup or the danger of civil war

prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski told 
the nation friday night he is not worried about prospects for talks 
with the opposition and he instead is concentrating on the ailing 
economy 
i would be a poor premier dealing only with the round table and 
making light of problems of millions of my fellow countrymen 
rakowski said in a 10minute nationwide television address that he 
said would be the first of several 
the appearance broadcast immediately after the evening news was 
to report on the results of his first month in office 
in an earlier meeting with western reporters rakowski said the 
talks promised by interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak in august 
are at the moment blocked but i think that the round table will 
take place 
the government has demanded that solidarity drop from its 
delegation to the proposed talks two opposition activists and 
solidarity leader lech walesa has refused a meeting to discuss the 
matter throwing the future of the talks in doubt 
in both his tv address and in the meeting with reporters 
rakowski struck a note of unconcern at the impasse 
there is no compromise at the given moment he told 
reporters but i treat this moment as a moment only i must admit 
that i have not thought about who should make the first step now 
he continued improving living conditions for the polish people 
are the most important thing for me the most important thing is 
that we can buy a piece of ham in a store and not on the black 
market 
rakowski who met the reporters in connection with a scheduled 
visit to poland next week of prime minister margaret thatcher said 
some western politicians are beginning to recognize the reforms 
taking place in poland 
do you really think that all western politicians condemn us 
he said do you think that the western politicians dont know that 
its the most liberal country in eastern europe and that the reforms 
are the deepest here 
the talks were agreed to in august during polands worst wave of 
strikes in seven years walesa halted the strikes after being 
promised that the talks could include the topics of relegalizing 
solidarity as well as broad questions of political and economic 
reform 
earlier friday a us government spokeswoman said the united 
states was concerned by reports of the impasse in progress towards 
the talks with walesa and the opposition 
we had welcomed the commitment by the government of poland to 
hold meaningful roundtable talks with representatives of polish 
society said state department spokeswoman philly oakley in 
washington 
if conducted in good faith such negotiations have the 
potential to put poland on the path of recovery and enhanced 
international economic standing 
but rakowski told the reportes he doubted that legalizing 
solidarity banned after the 1981 martial law crackdown would 
create fantastic growth and said he was against the myth that 
everything in poland depends on solidarity 
i already notice a certain progress in the economy and it was 
done without solidarity he said there is no solidarity in the 
countryside and production is growing every year by four percent 
government spokesman jerzy urban had announced tuesday that the 
government insisted on a preliminary meeting with walesa to discuss 
objections to the participation at the round table of two prominent 
solidarity advisers jacek kuron and adam michnik 
saying it would set a bad precedent for him to allow the 
government to interfere in an internal union decision walesa 
rejected such a preliminary meeting and asked that the talks begin 
immediately 
referring to kuron and michnik rakowski said we dont want at 
the table two men who openly express and have been expressing for 
some years now their wish to overthrow the system the government 
we are willing to talk to other people 
but he told the reporters that he did not think the impasse would 
be permanent poles are known for their capacity to compromise and 
there will always be a way out 
andrzej stelmachowski a church mediator acting for walesa in 
organizing the talks said in an interview that the ball is on 
the other side now 
in the tv address rakowski said his newly appointed government 
ministers were getting familiar with their new jobs but have already 
taken some steps with full energy 
he listed the creation of committees to deal with economic and 
social political problems a raise in retirees pensions plans to 
streamline government bureaucracy and the introduction of 
freemarket practices in the distribution of some foodstuffs

a minister said friday he would not take 
classes from his christian school to see an egyptian art exhibit at 
the mint museum because its opening was used to promote paganism 
an exhibit of more than 70 artifacts from the time of the pharaoh 
rameses ii opened oct 1 at the art museum some 600000 people are 
expected to see the show through january 
the rev joseph chambers chairman of concerned charlotteans and 
head of the paw creek christian academy said he felt the promoters 
of an opening ceremony for the exhibit showed insensitivity when 
they invited people to join in a ceremony in which ancient gods were 
asked to appear and bless the exhibition 
chambers stressed he was not opposed to the exhibit 
museum director milton bloch said that while he respected 
chambers concerns there was no need for an apology 
the mints preexhibition procession and promotion used some 
flowery phrases and theatrical fiction which it has turned out has 
offended some people in our community he said this result is 
entirely unintended

the state department confirmed friday it will 
ask outside arbiters to resolve a dispute with the soviet union over 
29 million in us claims relating to damages and defective 
construction work on the nearly completed us embassy in moscow 
president reagan announced thursday that he is recommending to 
congress that the building be demolished because the soviets 
installed listening devices he said a new americanbuilt 
embassy will be constructed 
state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the 
united states has invoked arbitration under a disputes clause in 
the construction contract 
a claim for damages relating to soviet penetration or the 
bugging of the new office building has not yet been quantified 
pending final building design for the new embassy building she 
said 
a state department source who disclosed the 29 million claim 
against the soviets on thursday said that before the issue could go 
before an arbitration panel we have to show good faith that the 
soviets and we have tried to work this out the source spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the claims for the delays and defects are to be negotiated by an 
arbitration panel in stockholm sweden 
the soviet news agency tass in a dispatch from washington said 
us claims that the building is riddled with spying devices are 
groundless and obviously farfetched 
congress will be asked to approve construction of a new embassy 
built by us workers using american materials 
james schlesinger the former defense secretary who documented 
security problems at the embassy said reagans recommendation that 
the building be razed and rebuilt shows reality caught up with 
us 
the united states has tended to be complacent over the years 
about soviet technology said schlesinger whom reagan 
commissioned to study the embassy in this case soviet technology 
turned out to be immensely and impressively sophisticated

sen dan quayle compared democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis to a mr pretzel man 
because of his twists and turns on the issues as the indiana 
senator stumped friday in pennsylvania dutch country 
on a bus tour that included stops to talk to school children and 
attend rallies quayle noted that the berks county region was 
renowned for making great pretzels 
thats pretty appropriate the republican vice presidential 
candidate told a rally at the roman catholic campus of alvernia 
college 
mr dukakis has made more twists and turns on the issues than 
any one of your pretzels he said maybe that ought to be the 
symbol of their campaign the pretzel 
quayle worked the pretzel idea into a litany he often uses in his 
stump speech to characterize dukakis 
you could call him mr tax increase mr polluter mr furlough 
man mr weakonnational defense mr pretzel man but added 
quayle one thing voters should never call dukakis is mr 
president 
in what an aide said was a bid to beef up voter turnout 
quayle took toured central pennsylvania republican strongholds as 
well as democratic areas where president reagan pulled a majority of 
votes in his 1984 presidential campaign 
were not taking anything for granted quayle told reporters 
before leaving friday morning for pennsylvania from syracuse ny 
quayles mission according to aides was to encourage voter 
turnout and ward off complacency in pennsylvanhia a state where 
bush is polling a bit ahead but the race is still considered close 
republican sens john heinz and arlen specter as well as state 
party chairman earl baker campaiged with quayle urged voters not to 
assume tht because bush is ahead in national polls that they dont 
have to vote 
the race said baker is neck and neck in pennsylvania 
in lancaster county quayle adviser jim cicconi said this area 
is clearly a good republican area and were trying to beef up 
turnout here 
at a drizzling outdoor rally outside the historic lancaster 
market quayle kept up a drumbeat of ridicule against dukakis 
calling the rainy day dukakis weather 
quayle quoted from a boston herald endorsement of bush which 
criticized dukakis the massachusetts governor 
the editorial cautioned those outside the state dont make our 
mistake we too wanted a leader and what we got was a man all too 
willing to sacrifice taxpayers of this state to his own quest for 
higher office 
the bus trip included roadside stops to greet schoolchildren who 
were let out of class to see the candidate 
and there were some quirky sights along the way a woman in a 
witch outfit two people dressed up like clowns a drivein called 
hoosier hamburgers as well as scenes typifying the agricultural 
region amish residents walked the streets and people in colonial 
dress and a fifeanddrum band greeted quayle in downtown lancaster

only a test battery an electrical 
connector and an insulation blanket were damaged by a flash fire 
that hit the magellan venus spacecraft in a hangar here nasa 
announced friday 
an agency official reiterated in a statement that the oct 17 
accident would have no impact on magellans launch scheduled next 
april aboard a space shuttle 
major systems on the 216 million probe were not harmed and the 
total cost of the damaged items was just 87000 said john r 
busse chairman of a board investigating the fire 
a technician who mistakenly plugged an electrical cable into the 
wrong socket during a test was blamed by nasa for the short circuit 
that triggered smoke and a 23inch tongue of flame from the test

mrs jackson who bought the jacket oct 22 at the attic in 
athens has hired an attorney to see if she can fight the decision

are not related 
i think the fairest thing to say is she just wants justice to 
be done her attorney george peters of athens said thursday 
obviously she wasnt certain of her legal rights at the time this 
occurred

store for some time when mrs jackson decided to buy it 
shed already paid for it and it was being folded when the 
money was found he said 
police officer inez mcelhannon took the coat and the money after 
a dispute arose over their ownership 
then the store owner contacted police sunday night to claim the 
money 
he said it was his coat and that he didnt know his wife had 
gotten it to sell ms mcelhannon said adding that he told 
police he had not realized he had left the money in the jacket 
mcelhannon said jackson told her he thought the money had been 
taken in a burglary last year she said he had reported to police

a sea lion that got fishing line 
tangled around its neck has evaded rescuers for six weeks and could 
die if it isnt captured soon marine mammal experts said friday 
the injured sea lion keeps to a buoy about 500 yards off newport 
harbor said judi jones a director of friends of the sea 
lionmarine mammal center in laguna beach 
its chances for survival are not good if not treated said 
bill ford an officer of the organization which rescues and 
rehabilitates injured and sick seals 
the animal is believed to be between 2 and 4 years old sea lions 
reach maturity about 8 
as the animal grows the monofilament line does not expand and 
the line will eventually cut off the organs in its neck ford said 
the minute we come near their instinct is to jump off the 
buoy ms jones said if they come up to us its their choice 
but our approaching them is a threat if theyre injured theyre a 
bit more wary 
sedation is not a viable alternative 
the minute the animal feels the stick or dart it becomes 
frightened ms jones said then it heads for the water gets 
drowsy and eventually drowns

only the second time in 200 years the united states will have a 
president with the first name of george 
the first as every kid learns was george washington and the 
second will be republican george bush acccording to a poll of 
670000 children ages 5 to 15 by weekly reader magazine 
the students say bush will beat democrat michael dukakis 58 
percent to 40 percent according to the weekly reader presidential 
poll which has correctly called eight races since its inception in 
1956 
in the first year students named republican dwight eisenhower to 
beat democrat adlai stevenson by a 603 percent to 368 percent 
margin eisenhower won with 57 percent of the vote

federal agents have obtained an arrest warrant 
for financier adnan khashoggi who denies racketeering and fraud 
charges filed against him and former philippine president ferdinand 
marcos according to published reports here and abroad 
an englishlanguage newspaper in saudi arabia arab news of 
jiddah reported khashoggis denial thursday under a riyadh 
dateline arab news editors said the denial was remitted to 
their office but declined to say how or by whom 
the los angeles times quoting unidentified sources reported in 
friday editions that us officials sought the arrest warrant out of 
fear that khashoggi would relocate to a country without any formal 
extradition treaty with the united states 
the us government is accusing khashoggi once reported to be 
the worlds richest man of acting as a front for marcos to help 
divert assets and hide marcos ownership of real estate and valuable 
art 
the arab news said he is disappointed that a technical legal 
question involving the scope of an injunction in a civil case to 
which he was not a party has been converted into a criminal 
allegation in a totally unprecedented manner he is confident that 
when all of the facts are made public as the proceeding progresses 
his lack of culpability will become manifest 
khashoggi was believed to be lying low in a european country 
consulting with advisers on how he should respond to the charges 
contained in a new york grand jury indictment the times said 
the times quoted sources close to khashoggi as saying the 
financier is considering returning to his native saudi arabia which 
has no extradition agreement with the united states 
the united states has extradition agreements with france britain 
and spain the countries where khashoggi currently maintains his 
primary residences 
although he believes he would ultimately be cleared of the 
charges the sources said he is concerned about the possibility of 
being arrested jailed and extradited 
khashoggis wealth once symbolized the rising economic power of 
the oilrich arab world in the 1970s but his financial empire began 
to crumble amid a pile of debt in the early 1980s 
meanwhile marcos arraignment in new york was delayed thursday 
until a courtappointed doctor can examine the 71yearold former 
philippine leader in hawaii where he and his wife imelda have 
lived since leaving the philippines in 1986 
marcos attorneys argued he was too ill to travel to new york for 
the arraignment mrs marcos however was ordered to appear at the 
new york hearing on monday

president reagan on friday signed bills 
calling for a threeyear 445 million program to help states deal 
with radon contamination and to reduce the threat to birds from 
plastic sixpack rings 
the radon bill authorizes 10 million a year for grants to state 
and local governments to develop radon programs and another 3 
million annually for technical assistance the balance for other 
activities includes 15 million for the environmental protection 
agency to study radon contamination in schools 
radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas found in soil 
which has been blamed for as many as 20000 lung cancer deaths 
annually in the united states 
the plastic bill gives the epa two years to promulgate 
regulations that would require use of degradable materials in 
beverage sixpack ring carriers sixteen states already have laws 
requiring those materials 
wildlife experts have said the plastic rings can remain intact 
for decades and pose a growing threat to fish and waterfowl which 
can become snared in them

a judge who upheld an attorneys 
right to shield the identity of a driver involved in a hitandrun 
fatality said he wants to review the lawyers testimony on the 
small chance he might change his ruling before the case goes to 
appeal 
in a rare display of judicial uncertainty palm beach county 
circuit judge timothy p poulton said thursday that he may change or 
revise his oct 13 decision after reviewing the testimony of 
attorney barry krischer 
krischer was hired by a person claiming to be the driver of a car 
that struck and killed mark baltes in palm beach on march 9 1986 
the driver asked krischer to keep his identity secret while 
negotiating a plea bargain with prosecutors 
the plea bargain fell through however and krischer has guarded 
the persons identity on the grounds of attorneyclient privilege 
poulton uphold that privilege in his ruling against baltes 
parents in their 6 million civil suit seeking to find the identity 
of the driver 
if we fail to rule as we do in this case the result would be 
the erection of a wall between the public and attorneys poulton 
wrote in his eightpage order plaintiffs case has tremendous 
emotional appeal it is difficult to rule against the plaintiffs 
but i am convinced that the law requires it 
but a week later poulton sent a twopage letter to the attorneys 
saying he realized the case would be appealed and that he wanted to 
review the testimony

the army on friday selected a winning 
contractor team to develop the engine that will power its next 
generation of helicopters and gave the goahead to two other teams 
to compete against each other in designing the rest of the chopper 
the service in brief announcements said it was awarding the 
engine contract to the light helicopter turbine engine co a 
partnership formed by the allison gas turbine division of the 
general motors corp and the garrett engine division of the allied 
signal aerospace co 
that partnership was selected over another competing team known 
as apw formed by the pratt amp whitney division of the united 
technologies corp and lycoming of textron inc 
the light helicopter turbine engine co previously had received a 
contract worth 1324 million and on friday it won another 754 
million to continue the work 
as for designing the rest of the chopper and building prototypes 
the army said it was releasing funds to two contractor teams and 
formally setting them in competition against one another each team 
received 158 million on friday to pursue the work the army said 
the two teams include a joint venture of boeing helicopters and 
united technologys sikorsky aircraft and another partnership that 
includes two units of the mcdonnell douglas corp and bell 
helicopter textron inc 
the army moves involve a project known as the lhx program and had 
been expected ever since congress approved the fiscal 1989 budget 
late last month 
lhx or light helicopter experimental is an effort to develop 
a new light attack and observation helicopter that can move the army 
into the 21st century the new craft would be used in replacing 
aging fleets of vietnamera ah1 cobra oh6 cayuse and oh58 kiowa 
choppers 
the army hopes to purchase 2096 of the new helicopters at a cost 
of roughly 40 billion the lhx program was cut in half early this 
year because of budget reductions but still stands as one of the 
armys most expensive programs ever 
the two engine teams began competing on what the army calls the 
t800 engine in july 1985 each lhx will require two of the engines 
and the army has long described the t800s development as a crucial 
step in improving existing technology 
todays award extends lhtecs fullscale development 
contract the army said apws contract will be terminated 
after developing the new engine the army expects the two team 
partners allison and garrett to compete against each other for 
annual production awards ultimately the engine work is expected to 
be worth more than 15 billion to the two companies 
allison is based in indianapolis ind and garrett is located in 
phoenix ariz 
the new engine is a 1200 shaft horsepower turbine and the first 
deliveries are being scheduled for 1995 
maj phil soucy an army spokesman said the contract also was 
unusual in that lhtec had provided a guarantee that the average cost 
of each engine would not exceed 245000

president reagan got iran mixed up with 
afghanistan briefly friday going on to say that moves for a change 
of some kind in the iranian government are under way 
the confusion came at an appearance before the los angeles world 
affairs council when reagan was asked if he would support efforts by 
the son of the late shah of iran to restore the monarchy 
if thats what the people of afghanistan who have fought so 
bravely and courageously to restore their freedom if thats their 
choice the president began 
a member of the council who was reading written questions 
submitted by members of the audience interrupted and said mr 
president were talking about iran 
oh what am i doing reagan said i got into afghanistan by 
mistake didnt i 
do you want me to repeat the question the council member 
said 
reagan did not ask her to repeat the question but he recalled 
that he and his wife nancy visited iran shortly before the shah fell 
and the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini came to power 
it was amazing to see that country then he said as you 
looked at the skyline you saw derricks all over these were 
building lowcost housing apartments for the people a land reform 
was put into effect that gave land as we once did through 
homesteading to the peasants and maybe part of the reason for the 
revolution was that most of that land belonged to the mullahs and 
they didnt like having it taken away 
i know that there are moves on and there are factions that are 
organizing right now with the expectation that come the end of the 
ayatollah the country can be moved in one of several directions 
reagan said 
i think that the united states would be very willing to be 
supportive of a regime that wanted to restore democracy and freedom 
to the people he said

a few legislators of the supreme soviet that 
traditional rubber stamp for the leadership made history friday 
night by voting against decrees restricting street demonstrations 
they lost by more than 1300 votes because they were 31 at most 
and the other members behaved in the customary manner 
president mikhail s gorbachev who has encouraged debate in his 
campaign for more democracy watched from the dais with other 
government and communist party leaders 
votes are taken by show of hands usually all hands for whatever 
measures the parliaments ruling presidium adopts between 
twiceyearly sessions the supreme soviet chamber in the grand 
kremlin palace does not have electronic voting equipment 
it appeared the leadership expected fridays dissent because the 
two laws were taken out of a presidium package for separate votes 
despite overwhelming support for the laws by supreme soviet 
deputies hundreds of them laughed or smiled as soviet photographers 
rushed to record the spectacle of legislators voting no 
dissenters kept their hands up long enough for functionaries to 
rush around and count 
one of the 3monthold decrees they opposed gives broad power to 
control demonstrations to paramilitary police whom protesters have 
accused of beating them 
on that measure the vote was announced to the deputies as 1348 
in favor 31 opposed and 24 abstentions state television reported 
one fewer yes vote with four abstentions and there was no 
explanation for the discrepancy 
on the second law which requires advance permission for 
demonstrations and has been used by local officials to ban a variety 
of gatherings the vote was announced to deputies as 1368 for 13 
against and four abstaining 
television reported three fewer abstentions and did not mention 
the rarity of negative votes in either case 
the supreme soviet took its first step away from rubberstamping 
in closed committee meetings in may amending a government proposal 
on taxation of cooperatives the new version passed unanimously in 
the public session 
deputies could move farther toward democracy next month when they 
consider a proposal for multiplecandidate elections of delegates to 
a new national parliament 
in introducing the measures presidium secretary tengiz n 
menteshashvili noted they had been criticized in the press and 
letters to the leadership 
only one deputy spoke against them a factory worker from the 
baltic republic of estonia a new soviet breeding ground of 
independence he said local government councils not the interior 
ministry should decide when paramilitary police are needed to quell 
demonstrations 
each republic has its own traditions said pavel p goryunov 
from the city of tartu he particularly objected to a provision 
allowing paramilitary police to enter homes in pursuit of suspects 
after goryunovs remarks a moscow subway worker and the chairman 
of the kiev city council spoke for the laws 
we must regulate political freedoms for the good of all said 
alexander s sukhanov the subway worker he said he did not 
understand people who called the laws an encroachment on human 
rights or a muzzle on democracy 
colleagues applauded gave him much more applause than goryunov 
menteshashvili the presidium secretary cited ethnic rioting in 
sumgait azerbaijan and problems in other cities as reasons for 
strict control of demonstrations dozens of people were killed in 
the sumgait riots involving azerbaijanis and ethnic armenians 
he held out the possibility of future amendments to the decrees 
we still have to gain practical experience in democracy 
menteshashvili said then we can introduce amendments 
the supreme soviet unanimously approved a 795 billion budget for 
1989 after trimming a projected deficit from 58 billion to 55 
billion official reports said additional income was found during 
committee sessions 
most new investment in the new budget is moved from heavy 
industry to providing consumer goods 
finance minister boris gostsev said thursday the government has 
run deficits for years because of huge losses by stateowned 
businesses this is the first year a deficit has been acknowledged

charles ng told a detective 
investigating a california murder spree that he helped dispose of a 
victims body according to court documents released during his 
extradition hearing 
the provincial court hearing is to determine if enough evidence 
exists to extradite ng a 27yearold former us marine to 
california the hearing has been closed to the public in its second 
week 
ng whose name is pronounced ing is accused in the slayings of 
12 people between june 1984 and january 1985 most of the charges 
involve sextorture killings at a rural cabin in calaveras county 
east of san francisco 
he faces 25 charges in california including at least 10 of 
murder 
san francisco police detective edward erdelatz said in an 
affidavit released by the court on thursday that he interviewed ng 
in canada about the slaying of one of the victims paul cosner a 
san francisco car salesman 
after being advised of his rights ng said he had a meeting in 
cosners car with leonard lake who was also suspected in the 
slayings erdelatz said in a sworn statement 
ng stated that lake said he lake had just shot cosner whose 
body was in the car erdelatz said ng stated he then helped 
lake dispose of cosners body 
lake killed himself in custody in 1985 ng came to canada and is 
serving a 4year sentence for an armed robbery in calgary alberta 
if extradited and convicted ng faces possible execution in 
california 
canada has a policy against extraditing anyone facing the death 
penalty the final decision rests with federal justice minister ray 
hnatyshyn 
reporters have been told that the hearing which was expected to 
last five weeks possibly could end sooner 
allegations of torture and mass murder in the california deaths 
have raised questions about canadas extradition procedure as 
recently as may california gov george deukmejian urged canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney to speed up the process 
in a letter deukmejian said denying the extradition could have 
the unfortunate consequence of making canada a haven for death 
penalty fugitives 
but ngs calgarybased lawyer don macleod predicted it could be 
a long time before ng heads south regardless of the outcome of the 
extradition hearings mcleod said an appeal is likely 
the hearing has attracted widespread attention in canada where 
the national news weekly macleans said the case will provide a 
clear test of canadas wilingness to return suspected criminals to 
jurisdictions where they could be put to death 
ng is being held at the maximum security edmonton institution 
during the hearing

economic policy officials of seven 
latin american nations with collective foreign debts of nearly 340 
billion will meet next month brazils treasury minister said friday 
mailson ferreira da nobrega said they would work on a common 
strategy for negotiations on debt forgiveness by creditor banks and 
governments 
i believe weve got to do something to reduce the stock of 
debt he told reporters during a break in a meeting of presidents 
of the group of eight nations 
this debt reduction is the way to make it possible for us to 
develop our economies and to avoid social unheavals and political 
instability he said 
finance ministers of the seven participating nations argentina 
brazil colombia mexico peru uruguay and venezuela could meet 
before years end da nobrega said 
panama is the eighth member of the group of eight but was 
suspended last february following the ouster of president eric 
delvalle by panamas military strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
details of the proposed economic meeting discussed by the 
presidents in closed meetings were expected to be announed saturday 
in a final communique 
da nobrega said the seven countries intend to negotiate debt 
reduction rather than taking unilateral action the countries are 
firmly convinced that confrontation does not pay he said 
he also said the group has no specific plan in mind and will 
examine every solution that has been put forward 
last month the un conference on trade and development said 
creditor banks and governments should forgive 30 percent of the debt 
owed by 15 nations including all seven active members of the group 
of eight 
the agenda for the second summit since the organization was 
formed in 1986 included strife in central america production and 
trafficking of illegal drugs and trade imbalances 
it was clear from the speeches made by all seven presidents 
thursday however that their deteriorating economies were the main 
concern 
since 1982 the region has transferred to the exterior about 
200 billion in interest payments the ratio of debt stock to total 
gross national products exceeds 57 percent these are incredible 
figures said president jose sarney of brazil his countrys 121 
billion foreign debt is the highest of any developing country 
mexico owes about 104 billion argentina 56 billion venezuela 
20 billion peru 16 billion colombia 16 billion and uruguay 
about 6 billion 
sarney stopped interest payments on 70 billion of brazils debt 
in february 1987 on taking office in july 1985 president alan 
garcia of peru suspended relations with the international monetary 
fund and said his government would pay interest only up to a maximum 
of 10 percent of perus annual export earnings 
argentina has renegotiated its foreign debt three times since 
1983 and is negotiating again with commercial banks and the imf 
on thursday the presidents called for a new dialogue with 
the united states and other industrial nations on narcotics 
trafficking and the conflicts in central america

the temporary suspension of a 35 billion 
contract with international business machines corp for the 
modernization of air traffic control computers was ordered lifted 
friday 
a threejudge board of contract appeals in the general services 
administration ruled against the hughes aircraft co a competitor 
for the contract which had challenged the awarding of the project 
to ibm 
the contract was the largest ever awarded ibm at the time the 
contract was awarded last summer ibm had spent 233 million of the 
federal aviation administrations money and 80 million of its own 
in the competition 
the appeals board is a semijudicial body that resolves 
government contract disputes it dismissed hughes contentions of 
irregularities in the way the contract was awarded including one 
that the faa gave preferential treatment to ibm by allowing ibm but 
not hughes to propose the use of used computers in the new system 
both ibm and hughes a subsidiary of general motors corp had 
competed for the contract to build a new automated computer system 
for the air traffic control operations the modernization project is 
to be completed in the late 1990s 
the project calls for replacing voice communications between air 
traffic controllers and pilots with electronic messages and could 
lead to the use of landbased computers to actually direct aircraft 
the project was to be done by 1998 with further enhancements later 
the transportation department selected ibm over hughes on july 
25 at a news conference announcing the award officials said ibm 
was selected primarily because it submitted a lower bid 
on aug 10 following hughes protest the contract was 
temporarily suspended 
hughes aircraft in its challenge asked that the contract with 
ibm be revoked arguing that the faa and transportation department 
had provided ibm with unfair advantages 
hughes accused the faa of failing to follow a requirement that 
said technical merits were to be given greater weight than price 
when awarding the contract 
hughes also claimed several irregularities caused its price to be 
inflated for example hughess bid relied on ibm to provide 
computer hardware but according to hughes aircraft ibm charged 
hughes substantially more for the hardware than what ibm quoted the 
faa for the same items in their separate bid 
ibm in a statement issued following the rule said the decision 
upholds the fair process by which the faa awarded the advanced 
automation system contract we are looking forward to resuming 
work 
deputy secretary of transportation mimi dawson said she was 
pleased that the contract could now continue with the production of 
equipment designed to meet increasing air traffic control demands 
for the next 20 to 30 years

a pharmaceutical company that manufactures abortion 
pills reversed itself friday and agreed to resume distribution of 
the drug after the government demanded it do so 
the company roussel uclaf announced its decision after health 
minister claude evin said the pills should be made available in the 
interest of public health 
roussel uclaf partly owned by the french government said it had 
no choice but to comply 
the firm announced wednesday it was pulling ru 486 also known as 
mifepristone off the market because of an outcry of public 
opinion at home and abroad and a threatened boycott of its 
products 
evin after meeting with company executives issued a statement 
saying frances 1975 law legalizing abortions must be respected 
the drug ru 486 is an advance because it does not involve use 
of an anesthetic the precautionary measures to be taken in 
administering this drug exclusively in approved health clinics 
provides indepensible safeguards to womens health evins 
statement said 
roussel uclaf is part of the giant west german chemical group 
hoescht which holds the majority share the french government has a 
36 percent share 
the government certified the pill for use under medical 
supervision sept 23 
since then 4000 women in france have used it with a success 
rate of 955 percent according to the drugs inventor etienne 
emile baulieu 
in a statement issued late friday the company said it accepted 
the governments order and would rescind its earlier decision and 
would resume distributing ru 486 in approved health centers 
roussel uclaf repeated that no medical reason had prompted 
its decision to withdraw the drug from distribution 
baulieu at a conference in rio de janeiro of the world congress 
of gynecology and obstetrics issued a statement saying he was 
very pleased with the decision to resume distribution 
he said the pill represented immense hope for third world 
countries 
it is a question of human misery of life and death it was not 
possible to keep such an important advance in the drawer just 
because certain pressure groups were against its distribution 
balieu said 
dr malcolm potts the president of family health international 
a nonprofit organization that specializes in developing 
contraceptives is attending the rio conference he said a vast 
majority of the hundredes of participants at the meeting applauded 
when the french decision was announced 
potts said that after the session dozens of gynecologists 
celebrated the move by ordering champagne in the restaurant of the 
hotel where the congress is being held 
dr john sciarra chairman of obstetrics at northwestern 
university in evanston ill who was attending the rio conference 
said the congress received the news of the french health 
ministrys move with enthusiasm 
the general reaction at the congress was that the withdrawal of 
the pill from the market on emotional grounds after it had been 
tested for effectiveness and safety seemed to be a very erratic 
response 
in washington kate michelman executive director of the national 
abortion rights action league applauded the governments action 
the french government has taken a strong stand against 
intolerance and in favor of the health of women we support this 
action and the message it sends to those who seek to impose their 
will on all of us she said 
antiabortion groups including the roman catholic church had 
welcomed the companys decision to suspend distribution 
cardinal albert decourtray president of the french bishops 
conference said friday he was astonished that the government 
intervened in such an authoritarian manner he denied that the 
church had pressured the company to halt distribution 
thousands of doctors attending the rio conference had called on 
roussel uclaf to continue making the abortion pill or pass the 
patent onto another manufacturer 
health ministry officials maintained the company acted to protect 
its image abroad when it halted distribution company officials said 
they had been inundated with mail from opponents to the drug in 
france and abroad especially the united states 
they said many letters threatened to boycott company products 
andre ulmann a roussel uclaf official who helped develop the 
pill told reporters at the rio conference a boycott would have cost 
the company substantial sums of money so we decided to stop 
making the drug 
the pill works by blocking the action of progesterone a hormone 
essential in all stages pregnancy researchers say it is effective 
in the first seven weeks of pregnancy particularly when used in 
conjuction with a second product called sulprotone or prostaglandin 
e 
they said the drug was not a doityourself pill that could be 
purchased over the counter and taken at home its use requires 
medical supervision 
evin in a television newscast said of the threatening letters 
received by roussel uclaf 
it seems it is the fundamentalist movements that have already 
protested at other times notably in 1975 when the abortion bill was 
passed

more than five times its original estimate at an auction of art and 
antiques widely reported to be from the collection of claus and 
sunny von bulow 
two king charles spaniels a landscape beyond an oil 
painting by british artist richard ansdell had a presale estimate 
of 25000 to 35000 the 10 percent buyers premium boosted the 
total price for the work to 198000 
sothebys had promised to keep the sellers name a secret but 
curiosity seekers flocked to the presale exhibition last weekend 
after the new york times reported that the auction entitled 
property from a private collection would feature the von bulow 
belongings 
an 83room mansion its almost obscene its a world i dont 
know of said evelyn goldstein of bayside who attended the sale 
with her daughter 
the 509 lots featured english furniture and decorations old 
master paintings silver and rugs much of it very ornate 
the silver is nice but a lot of the things i wouldnt like in 
my house mrs goldstein said 
von bulow has been living in europe since he was acquitted in 
1985 in a retrial of charges that he twice tried to murder his wife 
heiress sunny von bulow with insulin injections 
the offerings which sothebys predicted would bring between 6 
million and 75 million were said to include furnishings from 
clarendon court the von bulows mansion in newport ri and 
pieces from the couples manhattan apartment 
some sale items fizzled henripierre danlouxs portrait of his 
wife and infant son which had a presale estimate of 300000 to 
400000 was yanked from the auction block when the top bid

a federal judge has refused to sanction sears 
roebuck and co for selling lawn darts at a store in puerto rico in 
violation of a consent decree with the consumer product safety 
commission 
us district judge joyce hens green refused to cite the company 
for civil contempt of court and impose sanctions sought by the cpsc 
she cited evidence that sears has taken all possible steps to 
eliminate the sale of lawn darts in its stores 
the judges decision dated tuesday was made public friday 
this decision is especially gratifying because it acknowledges 
our commitment to the consumer and to safety said michael bozic 
chairman and chief executive officer of the sears merchandise group 
in chicago 
sears was the first major retailer to discontinue selling the 
product bozic said in spite of these steps we were unfairly 
singled out by the cpsc because one of our 800 stores inadvertently 
failed to remove them from sale 
the commission had sought the contempt citation after a random 
survey of 20 stores found that sears was selling lawn darts at one 
outlet in violation of a consent decree it had entered into with the 
agency 
the consent decree required sears to properly label lawn darts 
post large warning signs and take other steps to ensure that 
consumers were warned of the products safety hazards 
the judge noted that sears went farther than the consent decree 
ordering all of its 800 stores to stop selling the product sears 
has convincingly shown that it has achieved substantial compliance 
with the obligations imposed by the consent decree the judge 
found 
while the court does not condone even a few nonconforming 
darts in a single store the fact that some such darts were 
discovered does not obviate the force of sears commendable efforts 
and it does not provide a basis for entry of civil contempt in this 
instance

more than 500 people opposed to the 
government have returned from border refuges to which they had fled 
and more are expected to reach reception camps by a nov 18 
deadline the government said friday 
government spokesman kyaw sann told journalists the deadline 
would not be extended but the government would make all efforts to 
let the students know our intention to receive them back without 
malice 
by thursday he said 525 people had returned to their homes 
after passing through 27 centers opened the government opened oct

they fled after a sept 18 military coup and brutal suppression 
of a popular uprising against 26 years of authoritarian military 
rule most went to areas controlled by various ethnic rebel groups 
also fighting the rangoon government

those returning who had not committed specific criminal offenses 
karen sources on the thaiburma border cited unconfirmed reports 
however that some people had been mistreated at the reception 
centers they said the alleged mistreatment includes forcing people 
to run in circles until they drop from exhaustion and severely 
restricting food and water 
kyaw sann the government spokesman said 21 insurgents and 15 
soldiers were killed in 37 clashes oct 2227 he said the 
skirmishes did not include those with the karen national union

president pw botha may be 
heartened enough by the overall results of this weeks local 
elections to call a general election in a few months political 
analysts said friday 
bothas national party lost about 90 communities wednesday to 
farright candidates opposed to his ideas for limited desegregation 
and powersharing with blacks but won in johannesburg and pretoria 
and repelled conservative party challenges almost everywhere outside 
transvaal the most populous province 
there is enough positive news for the national party in the 
results to tempt them into a general election said richard 
humphries a political scientist at johannesburgs university of the 
witwatersrand 
david braun political correspondent for the star the countrys 
largest daily newspaper said support existed within bothas cabinet 
for a general election in march or april a year earlier than 
required 
braun and other analysts suggested botha may calculate that 
despite its gains the conservative party has shown itself incapable 
of winning a national election 
experts interviewed by the star said the conservatives who now 
hold 23 of parliaments 178 seats could add 11 to 23 more if a 
general election were held soon 
botha signaled his interest in wooing rightwing voters by 
forwarding to the presidents council on friday a controversial bill 
to tighten enforcement of the group areas act which mandates racial 
segregation of residential areas 
the council controlled by the national party has the power to 
implement deadlocked legislation such as the group areas bill 
parliaments white chamber approved the bill but its smaller 
chambers for asians and people of mixed race rejected it the black 
majority is excluded from parliament 
party leader andries treurnicht said his conservatives will 
resegregate business districts in towns it now controls chris 
heunis the constitutional development minister said only 
parliament can do that 
the citizen a progovernment johannesburg newspaper urged botha 
to dispel the impression that his party was uncertain how to deal 
with black political demands 
the conservative party capitalizes on this uncertainty by 
simply suggesting that whatever the government does or plans to do 
will put another nail in the white mans coffin the citizen said 
many moderate voters would give the national party their 
support if it got its act togther and spelled out where it is taking 
south africa 
the star said the local elections gave botha two reasons to 
proceed with reform first the conservative challenge has been 
brought down to earth and second the considerable stayaway in the 
black colored mixedrace and indian elections highlights a 
vehement rejection of the present system of government 
noting that conservative party supporters are less than 4 percent 
of the population it said reform cannot afford to be halted by 
such puny opposition

police seized antitank rockets 
grenades automatic weapons and explosives during raids that netted 
14 people suspected of being palestinian terrorists prosecutors 
said friday 
one security source said you could arm an army with such an 
arsenal 
sources have said those arrested planned an attack in a foreign 
country not identified but spokesman alexander prechtel of the 
chief federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said friday the 
targets nature was not clear 
a senior state department official in washington said privately 
that west german police suspect the palestinians planned to hit 
american or israeli targets but he added that information available 
to the united states was sketchy 
prechtel said 10 of the 14 detained in the raids wednesday and 
thursday had been released but did not say why or whether they 
might face charges later he would not name the four still held but 
said they were men two born in syria and two in jordan in the age 
range 35 to 46 
earlier official reports had said 13 people were arrested in the 
raids on 18 locations in west berlin hamburg frankfurt and neuss 
just outside duesseldorf 
according to prechtel one of the jordanianborn men had been 
sentenced to life imprisonment in israel but was released in a 1979 
prisoner swap he had gone to israel on a terrorist mission in 1968 
and was arrested after the explosives he was carrying exploded 
prematurely wounding him the spokesman said 
he said man the arrived in west germany from damascus capital of 
syria prechtel said the four men kept in custody were suspected of 
establishing a terrorist cell of the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command in west germany and storing 
weapons 
ahmad jibril a former syrian army captain leads the 
syriancontrolled palestinian group which opposes yasser arafat 
chief of the palestine liberation organization 
western and middle east intelligence reports say jibrils men 
have been assigned temporarily to syrian and libyan secret services 
in the past to carry out assasinations and bombings 
the washington official said syrias role with the pflpgeneral 
command was a major reason for continuing cool relations between the 
united states and president hafez assads government 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said we commend 
the german authorities for the outstanding police and intelligence 
work this demonstrates that international terrorism remains a 
threat 
chief federal prosecutor kurt rebmann has taken over the 
investigation of the palestinians prechtel said 
about the possible targets he said in a telephone interview 
we can conclude that we are dealing with an organization we 
can conclude that they were planning the most serious crimes 
including murder but where when against whom and with what 
motives is still totally unclear 
describing what was found in just one frankfurt apartment 
prechtel listed an antitank bazooka 25 grenades more than six 
pounds of tnt several pounds of other explosives six machine guns 
and other weapons and ammunition 
he said police found many detonating devices including a 
batterypowered delayaction detonator at an apartment in neuss 
and seized false papers that included forged passports of several 
countries 
security sources said privately of the men in custody arrived in 
west germany in recent months and the fourth lived here they said 
all had been under surveillance and we had them under control 
west german authorities had expressed concern about possible 
terrorist attacks linked to the trial in frankfurt of confessed twa 
hijacker mohammed ali hamadi a shiite moslem from lebanon 
chief duesseldorf prosecutor jochen ruhland said thursday 
however that we have no clues of such a connection

the outlawed irish republican army has enough 
libyansupplied weapons but is facing a shortage of top agents 
willing to risk their lives senior british military sources serving 
in northern ireland said friday 
the sources from headquarters in belfast spoke with the 
condition they not be identified 
they said that despite the iras problems its terrorist campaign 
was expected to continue especially against british soldiers on the 
british mainland and in western europe 
the assessment is that they ira guerrillas have come to the 
conclusion that killing english scottish and welsh soldiers causes 
more pain and grief than killing irish soldiers one source said 
this year ira guerrillas have killed 26 british military 
personnel in attacks in england and europe 
the source said it was impossible to say if the ira is now 
stronger or weaker it began its campaign nearly 20 years ago to 
unite northern ireland a british province where protestants 
outnumber roman catholics 32 with the predominantly catholic irish 
republic under a leftist government 
the ira is stronger because it is much better armed but it also 
is weaker because its support in the catholic community has 
decreased and the number of people personally involved in its 
terrorism has dropped according to the source 
he said six years ago the ira would call off an attack if it 
risked losing a prestige weapon such as a shoulderfired 
rocketpropelled grenade but an estimated 150 tons of weapons from 
libya have given the group a highquality arsenal 
the source said security forces in northern ireland have captured 
about five tons of ira weapons but it is believed most of the libyan 
shipments remain hidden in the republic of ireland with small 
amounts smuggled across the border when needed 
we believe that theyve got the arms they need now to sustain a 
campaign at the level which theyve been running recently for a 
matter of years he added 
the sources said the libyan shipments have included heavy machine 
guns rocketpropelled grenades quantities of commercial explosives 
and sovietmade sam7 surfacetoair missiles capable of downing 
helicopters and other aircraft no surfacetoair missiles have been 
used in the northern ireland conflict 
the critical factor at the moment is the people that 
theyve got with the bottle courage to really press home an attack 
and risk their life another source said 
he suggested the ira was short of such guerrillas because of 
war weariness and the possibilities of death or long prison 
terms 
take the hardest of the hard core perhaps being the shooters 
perhaps there are only 20 or 30 he said 
there are others willing to plant bombs store and transport 
weapons and help the terrorists but support for the ira is 
dwindling he added

nine of 10 people accused of running what was once 
the citys largest cocaine ring were convicted friday and a judge 
said their conspiracy had been a serious threat to the community 
the chambers brothers organization allegedly supplied cocaine to 
about half the estimated 1000 drug houses in the nations 
sixthlargest city and imported youngsters from arkansas to help 
us attorney roy c hayes said the convictions wont have an 
immediate effect on cocaine trafficking in detroit 
were not going to reduce the supply in a case from 1983 to 
1987 he said but i think the harsh message will begin to 
send a lesson 
some of the 10 defense attorneys said they planned to review a 
transcript of the trial to determine if an appeal would be filed 
i think it is very difficult in these times for a person 
accused of trafficking narcotics to get a fair trial as say a 
person accused of murder said charles lusby attorney for billie 
joe chambers im not saying my client didnt get a fair trial 
but i believe theres a bias in our community and it is very 
difficult for people to set aside that bias 
convicted of conspiracy were willie larry billie joe and otis 
chambers along with eric l wilkins elaine coleman lucas belinda 
lumpkin jerry gant and marshall glenn 
us district richard suhrheinrich revoked bonds for three of the 
defendants who had been free during the sixweek trial declaring 
the court finds that this conspiracy is a threat a serious 
threat to this community 
paul young was acquitted of conspiracy for allegedly hiring 
teenagers to process crack cocaine however young already is 
serving a life sentence for firstdegree murder 
larry and billie joe chambers also were convicted of running a

the national liars hall of fame issued 
its annual pinocchio award on friday to a farm columnist who said 
the drought was so bad in ohio that a roman catholic priest tried to 
turn wine back into water 
politicians were ineligible for the grand prize won by russell 
hoy a columnist for the ohio farmer 
we have a rule that politicians cant participate only 
amateurs said roger welsch the halls founder and an expert in 
nebraska folklore 
even vice president george bush who was to campaign friday 
evening in omaha was told to keep his distance from the competition 
crowning the teller of this years tallest tale 
well actually the liars just didnt bother to invite him 
entertainer johnny carson who grew up in nebraska didnt show 
up either but he received special recognition for his 
contribution to the art of the tall tale during the induction 
ceremony at erics big table tavern 
its hard to sort out whats true and whats not in a liars 
club said linda welsch rogers wife 
dick cavett another nebraska native was on hand for the 
induction ceremony and received a public service award for his 
comedy radio program 
all my life ive dreamed of being here whoops he said to 
the laughter of veteran liars 
hoys winning lie said the 1988 drought was so dry that the 
baptists were sprinkling and the presbyterians were using a damp 
cloth for baptisms 
he said the lutherans were passing out rain checks and at 
least one catholic priest was working at turning wine back into 
water 
championship lies honored the past two years were told by one 
competitor who said he once met an honest fisherman and another who 
claimed he once saw a lawyer standing outside on a cold winter day 
with his hands in his own pockets 
many of this years yarns targeted the summer drought including 
an anonymous entry from nearby central city that insisted 
authorities had banned water skiing on the platte river because it 
was kicking up too much dust 
most people deep down inside like to stretch a story said 
eric nielsen owner of the tiny tavern i dont know why but all 
of us are guilty of it 
the 2yearold liars hall consists of three plaques on a wooden 
wall near the mens room along with pictures of presidents 
washington johnson nixon and reagan 
the pictures are there because of the old story that washington 
never told a lie johnson never told the truth and nixon never knew 
the difference nielsen said adding that reagan has been added 
because he forgot 
this years event got a great deal of publicity and organizers 
worried about how to come up with an induction ceremony that would 
satisfy the expectations of outoftowners 
the problem is in the past the ceremony itself was all 
fabricated mrs welsch said its really gotten out of hand 
a news release described the induction as the 37th annual event 
and said it was attended by a crowd of 1455 in white ties 
nielsen said he tried to discourage reporters from attending 
we thought about telling them when they got here that it was 
already over and we just lied about the time he said

the occupational safety and health 
administration should be congratulated for doing its job in fining 
john morrell amp co a record 433 million for violations at its 
meatpacking plant here a union leader said friday 
osha conducted a sixmonth investigation after workers complained 
and found the company did little or nothing in light of hundreds of 
serious injuries to hand and arm joints caused by the repetitive 
motion of the meatpacking line 
we actually congratulate osha for doing their job during this 
present administration we found that getting osha to do their job 
sometimes was very difficult said jim lyons president of local 
304a of the united food and commercial workers union the local 
represents workers at the sioux falls plant 
the osha citation basically says that morrell knew that there 
was a problem we brought that problem to them we addressed it with 
them many times they knew ways of preventing it and not only that 
we found their medical mismanagement to be incredible a large 
incredible problem and obviously osha found our account to be 
accurate lyons said 
the osha report exposed the ugly truth about the health and 
safety conditions inside the sioux falls plant he said 
morrell is being singled out for penalties in what is a national 
safety and health problem affecting many industries the company 
said chairman milton j schloss in a statement from company 
headquarters in cincinnati called the fine grossly unfair and 
totally unjustified 
the fine is the seventh time in almost two years that the 
meatpacker has been cited for safety problems 
in april 1987 osha fined morrell 690000 for alleged 
recordkeeping violations dealing with injuries an administrative 
law judge in denver dismissed the fine this week saying the statute 
of limitations expired 
in september the agency slapped the company with a 28900 fine 
for safety violations stemming from a plant inspection last spring 
morrell is contesting the citation 
workers have complained that morrell has increased the speed of 
its production lines at the meatpacking plant and that injury rates 
have soared accordingly injuries and past osha fines have led to 
segments on the tv news magazine programs 2020 and west 
57th and articles in major newspapers 
osha officials said the incidence of repetitive motionrelated 
disorders at the sioux falls plant was nine times higher than the 
industry average and 600 times the rate for all us industries 
morrell however said the injuries that had to be reported fell 
from 705 per 1000 fulltime workers in january when it hired a 
fulltime safety director for its plants here and in sioux city 
iowa to 1675 in october 
morrell and the union have been at loggerheads dozens of times 
including strikes contract deadlocks lawsuits and appearances 
before regulatory boards 
the company and the union are in the middle of talks for a new 
contract at the sioux falls plant morrell has asked for wage cuts 
ranging from 125 an hour to 175 an hour to a base rate of 8 an 
hour union officials have said if the company continues to push for 
wage cuts a strike is possible the contract expires nov 20

two gray whales that were stranded in 
arctic ice for nearly three weeks apparently swam to freedom friday 
ending a milliondollar rescue effort watched around the world 
there is no evidence of the whales in the immediate area 
rescue coordinator ron morris said i think the whales are 
definitely gone 
north slope borough mayor george ahmaogak said the whales were 
last seen at 845 am 
they were looking good ahmaogak said after talking by radio 
to eskimos who had gone to open breathing holes for the whales the 
last sighting was about an hour before sunrise ahmaogak later made 
an observation flight over 15 miles of the coastline south and west 
of barrow 
i feel great i feel like i got no more burden said arnold 
brower the senior whaling captain who directed the eskimo rescue 
efforts of cutting breathing holes in the ice with chainsaws 
asked if he was confident the two gray whales swam to freedom 
rather than died brower replied yes 
morris called the whales survival chances pure speculation 
they had the will to live they should make it 
whether the whales survive probably will never be known because 
biologists chose not to tag them with radio transmitters to keep 
track of them 
brower said he was confident the two whales had reached the 
channel cut by two soviet icebreakers 
if the california gray whales followed the icebreakers channel 
they would still have to navigate leads natural breaks in the 
ice that vary greatly in width and close or open according to the 
wind about 200 miles to open ocean 
biologist howard braham director of national oceanic and 
atmospheric administrations national marine mammal laboratory in 
seattle said he thought the whales could make the 200mile journey 
if they would get moving 
this is an open water species basically and for whatever 
reason being in the ice is new to them he said they are not 
adapted for it anatomically they are in unfamiliar territory 
the icebreakers spent much of the night plowing through the ice 
off alaskas northern coast to slice another escape route for the 
whales originally trapped at a small breathing hole four miles from 
open water a third whale trapped with them died earlier 
the arseniev and the larger admiral makarov had been expected at 
first light to head for their home port of vladivostok but their 
crews reported they could stay to help rescuers said 
rescuers had thought that after the soviet ships smashed a 
channel to open water earlier this week the relatively young marine 
mammals would have resumed their migration south but at first they 
did not move and parts of the channel refroze 
the temperature early friday was 14 degrees below zero 
when last seen late thursday the whales condition appeared 
worse after they had struggled through the slush and ragged ice left 
in the icebreakers wake wednesday night and thursday both bled 
from multiple but superficial cuts 
i think if they can stay in the small cracks and open leads 
that are frequent on the front of the pack ice frequently that ice 
is thinner and if they dont make wrong turns they should make it 
out still they have some rough going braham said they may 
make mistakes

defended his unions backing of george bush for president while 
telling over 1500 members hes prepared to fight to keep the union 
a strong unified force 
bush i know will do a good job mccarthy said after 
delivering a stateoftheunion address to representatives of 750 
locals from around the nation 
dukakis theres no way he can run the country if he cant run 
the state mccarthy said of the massachusetts governor 
vice president bush the republican candidate was favored by 
502 percent of the teamsters surveyed in a recent union poll 
democrat michael dukakis was backed by 464 percent of the union 
members 
the union endorsed ronald reagan in 1980 and 1984 the aflcio 
which the teamsters rejoined last year is supporting dukakis 
mccarthy 61 of boston was elected head of the teamsters after 
the death of jackie presser in july he is known to dislike dukakis 
republican gov james r thompson who briefly addressed the 
meeting sparked some boos from the audience when he said he was 
there to deliver bushs thanks for the endorsement 
however mccarthy defended throwing the unions support to the 
gop the time has changed no longer do you vote for the party 
you vote for the man he said 
mccarthy declined to say what tactic his union the nations 
largest would take should bush if elected pursue the federal 
governments lawsuit to force reforms on the teamsters 
the civil racketeering lawsuit filed in new york in june is 
aimed at cleansing the union of alleged mob influence federal 
officials say 
ill cross that bridge when i come to it mccarthy said but 
he added that he hopes bush gives me what i want 
one of the delegates chuck mack president of teamsters joint 
council no 7 in san francisco predicted mccarthy is going to be 
judged on the role he plays in contract negotiations and other 
more fundamental issues 
mccarthy won points among the rankandfile friday for his vow to 
play a handson role in bargaining and organizing 
evidence members say is the unions decision earlier this month 
to abolish a decadesold practice requiring twothirds no votes 
to turn down tentative accords negotiated by its top leaders 
the new policy requires only a simple majority any yes vote 
greater than 50 percent to approve contracts covering the 
internationals membership 
it is considered a major victory for the rankandfile said 
teamsters spokesman chip roth they love it mccarthy said in a 
brief meeting with reporters after fridays address 
he declined to discuss what dissidents say led to the action a 
lawsuit challenging a decision by top teamster officials in may to 
ignore a 635 percent membership rejection of a contract covering an 
estimated 200000 interstate truckers and warehouse workers 
we dont have any problems mccarthy said tersely we all 
love each other

warsaw pact on friday proposed an eastwest summit to review 
reductions in military forces and conventional armaments in europe 
the mti news agency reported 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and the top diplomats 
of the six other pact members hungary poland bulgaria east 
germany romania and czechoslovakia are attending a meeting that 
opened friday mti said 
the official hungarian agency said that in a statement issued 
late friday the ministers proposed a summit of all european 
countries plus the united states and canaca to review cuts in 
conventional armed forces on the continent 
the statement on confidence and securitybuilding measures and 
disarmament in europe also called for the banning of large 
military maneuvers and reductions in the size duration and 
frequency of other maneuvers 
mti said the foreign ministers proposed 
notification of independent activities by air and naval forces 
and creation of zones of confidenece and security in europe and the 
adjoining seas and oceans 
the freezing and reduction of military expenditures and the 
establishment of a european information and contactmaintaining 
center for the prevention of any surprise attack 
measures for the regular exchange of data about the armed forces 
and their operations and for the exchange of information on the 
structure and substance of military budgets

being held in vienna to review compliance with the helsinki accords 
on european security that were signed in 1975 by virtually all 
european countries and america and canada 
earlier this month at the vienna conference the soviets removed a 
major obstacle to proposed new talks on reducing conventional 
weapons in europe 
diplomats in geneva said the soviets reversed their stand and 
agreed that tactical nuclear weapons would not be included in the 
new talks between members of the north atlantic treaty organization 
and warsaw pact on conventional forces 
the new negotiations would replace the mutual and balanced force 
reduction talks that have dragged on in vienna for 15 years

from the sea to the sierra long lines 
of californians snatched lotto tickets at 10 times the normal pace 
friday as gamblers dreamed of overnight wealth in a record jackpot 
thats climbed to more than 57 million 
the top prize in the saturday night drawing will bring the title 
for north americas largest jackpot back to california exceeding 
the 551 million prize awarded by florida on sept 3 california 
lottery officials said 
lotto 649 players were expected to spend roughly a dollar 
for every man woman and child in california friday with sales for 
the day projected at nearly 30 million said lottery spokesman bob 
taylor normal sales for a friday would be about 3 million he 
added 
some of the players needed the jackpot less than others 
i come from a long line of people with money but you know it 
wouldnt hurt to replenish the bloodline so to speak with a little 
new cash said 53yearold dorothy williams who was standing in 
line to buy five 1 tickets at a store on san franciscos 
prestigious nob hill 
in contrast lee tran a 29yearold vietnamese immigrant 
standing in a line of 10 people at a market street convenience store 
in san francisco said my whole family has put up money for our 
chance to win the big jackpot this is our dream this is why we 
came to america to make it big

winners and were rolled over or added to the prize 
with gambling heavier than conservatively estimated the 
staterun lottery on friday revised the projected jackpot which 
also is fed by sales upward to more than 57 million 
the lottomania that has stricken californians means almost

chinas top government spokesman said friday that 
foreign investors now operating in this country will be protected 
from a nationwide campaign to slash spending and cool off a badly 
overheated economy 
spokesman yuan mu added however that the economic slowdown will 
have some effect on foreign firms still negotiating new projects in 
china 
at the same time yuan denied reports of dissension among top 
leaders on how to solve the economic crisis without crippling the 
decadeold policy of letting market forces rather than central 
planners guide the economy 
yuan is spokesman for the state council or cabinet his rare 
news conference for foreign and chinese journalists was apparently 
meant to assure the outside world that tough measures to regain 
control over the economy do not signal a reversal in chinas overall 
policies of reform and opening to foreign nations 
despite soaring inflation and other woes the present economic 
development in china is in the main good he said 
yuan emphasized that chinas decision to cut investment in fixed 
assets next year by 133 billion will not affect foreigners already 
doing business in china 
all the contracts and agreements reached between china and 
foreign firms will be honored all projects of cooperation and joint 
ventures will be carried out he said adding that well take a 
policy of protection for foreign investors 
in a meeting of its central committee in late september the 
communist party announced a twoyear economic retrenchment to combat 
an inflation rate of about 20 percent a 40 percent growth in the 
money supply overheated growth serious supply shortages and 
widespread public corruption 
measures since taken include cancellation of hundreds of 
construction projects freezing of some product prices that had 
previously been decontrolled reassertion of government controls 
over trade and shutting down companies found guilty of profiteering 
in scarce goods or corruption 
yuan said the measures were drawn up by all top leaders it is 
groundless to say that between principal leaders in the party and 
government in china there exist differences 
reports in the western and hong kong press suggested that party 
general secretary zhao ziyang the chief proponent of rapid reforms 
has been overshadowed by the more cautious premier li peng as a 
result of economic troubles linked to the reforms 
the official press on thursday issued details of zhaos speech to 
the september central committee meeting in which he supported the 
need for economic stability 
he said inflation should be brought under 10 percent this is 
the touchstone by which we will test the partys and governments 
ability to lead and be in command of the situation 
yuan said a fiveyear program for reforming chinas price system 
considered key to the nations economic future will proceed next 
year but the pace will slow down 
he said the emphasis in 1989 will be on adjusting prices for farm 
goods a doubletrack system for agricultural and other raw 
materials in which the government sets some prices at artificially 
low levels and others are allowed to float is a major cause of 
profiteering in government and business ranks 
yuan said all workers will receive raises next year but the 
level of salary increases has not been determined 
he said that when local officials ignore orders from beijing to 
tighten their belts the central government has the legal and 
disciplinary means to enforce its austerity program

the rightwing likud bloc will win the general 
election or the vote will end in a stalemate according to election 
polls published friday 
the four surveys indicate likud along with its rightwing and 
religious allies will capture 56 to 65 seats in tuesdays 
parliamentary elections 
the labor party and its leftwing partners are expected to take 
46 to 55 seats far short of the 61 needed to form a majority in the 
the 120member legislature the polls said 
there are two possibilities political analyst and pollster 
hanoch smith told the associated press we can expect either 
another laborlikud coalition or a victory by likud aligned with 
its rightwing allies and the orthodox parties 
on the other hand not very many people would predict that 
labor will be able to form a government 
the four organizations who conducted the surveys this week 
provided no margin of error only one the pori research institute 
provided the number of people interviewed 1200 most polls in 
israel interview 1200 people as a representative sample of the 
population 
one survey by the likudaligned modiin ezrahi shows likud 
taking 43 seats and its allies an additional 22 for a winning 
65delegate total 
it seems that likud will form the coalition and according to 
my calculations it will be a strong coalition said rahel israeli 
who conducted the poll published in the maariv daily 
a poll conducted by machon yisraeli an independent polling 
group shows likud and its partners capturing between 57 and 63 
seats 
the pori research institute which is also nonaligned had likud 
with a slight edge over labor 
it looks today that likud is stronger than labor but no one 
knows what will happen on election day said rafael gill director 
of pori 
the three polls indicated more than 10 percent of voters were 
undecided 
if neither party can form a government labor and likud could be 
forced to join together in a coalition like the one created after 
the stalemated 1984 elections 
but according to modiin ezrahi 46 percent of likud voters and 58 
percent of labor supporters oppose continuing such a national unity 
government 
smith said his surveys indicate that as many as 75 percent of the 
general electorate want a decision one way or the other 
but a majority say a standoff or a likud government will 
emerge he said 
the laboraligned pollster tatzpit said labors leftwing 
grouping would win 55 seats while the arab communist hadash party 
would take four and other arab parties another four delegates labor 
has repeatedly refused to form a government with the communists 
the labor party has been losing popularity since december when a 
palestinian uprising against the 21year israeli occupation erupted 
in the west bank and gaza strip more than 300 palestinians and six 
israelis have died in the violence 
smith said polls indicate labor was 16 points ahead of likud in 
december but by june the two parties were running neckandneck 
likud which opposes giving up any occupied land has pledged to 
use more force to end the uprising labor has said it will give up 
parts of the west bank and the gaza strip in exchange for peace

and that was just for openers the day after he resolved to wage a 
gentler kinder presidential campaign in its concluding days 
los angeles is the movie capital of the world and if my 
opponent is elected the movie will be called malaise two the 
sequel bush said recalling the word that figured in the 
political downfall of president carter 
at a california town hall breakfast in los angeles bush stuck to 
the economic theme he has stresse every day this week one message 
that didnt vary his insistence that americans are far better off 
today than when president reagan came to office in 1980 
the vice president said dukakis would scrap policies that work in 
favor of new spending plans and probably new taxes he wants to 
torpedo the prosperity that we have worked so hard to achieve 
bush told about 600 people at the los angeles breakfast 
he said the democratic nominee contends american families are 
better off because women have been forced into the work force 
frankly that strikes me as sexist because it implies that women 
wouldnt work unless they had to bush said 
at the california highway patrol academy in sacramento bush was 
received endorsements from two police organizations the california 
correctional peace officers association claiming 18000 members 
and the international association aof correctional officers which 
says it represents 300000 lawmen 
bush said that of all his differences with dukakis none is 
deeper and wider than on crimefighting on such matters as the 
death penalty tough judges prison furloughs 
the gop candidate said he believes that most of the policemen who 
have endorsed his campaign consider themselves democrats 
a lot of mainstream americans feel that the national democratic 
party in 1988 just simply doesnt represent them any more he said 
you might almost say that the democratic party today suffers 
from a split personality with a rank and file made up of some of the 
best of america the silent majority he said but the 
leadership much of it is a remnant of the 60s the new left those 
campus radicals grown old the peace marchers and the nuclear freeze 
activists 
bush said he represents mainstream america 
any trend toward campaign kindness was marginal at most despite 
the resolution bush offered in the euphoria of a hollywood reception 
thursday night on the floodlit lawn at bob hopes giant estate 
were not going to be talking on the negative side any more 
bush said then its going to be a kinder and gentler finish to 
this campaign 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said friday the comment did 
not signal any change in campaign strategy or in gop television 
advertisements he wants to talk positively but that doesnt mean 
he wont continue to draw contrasts to his opponent fuller said 
the gop nominee said voters should think of peace and prosperity 
when they go to the polls nov 8 peace means you can sleep at 
night knowing that the world will still be there in the morning 
bush said prosperity means you can sleep at night knowing that 
opportunity will still be there in the morning 
but i ask you to consider what kind of morning would electing 
the liberal governor of massachusetts bring would a democratic 
morning bring 
will it be gloomy will the dark clouds of pessimism and 
limited opportunity obscure our vision 
in omaha friday night bush campaigned with nebraskas appointed 
sen david karnes struggling to hold a gop seat against favored 
former gov bob kerrey 
he taunted dukakis over farm policya recalling the grain embargo 
imposed against the soviet union by president carter he said it 
didnt work then and it wouldnt work now 
i will never use food as a political embargo tool he told a 
rally at omaha civic auditorium 
on saturday bush scheduled a sixstop bus tour in the chicago 
area wrapping up the next to the last week of the campaign with 
another push for the 24 electoral votes illinois will award on nov 
8 
bush said one of two men will be elected president that day 
only one of us is on the move and headed in the right direction 
and that is me he said

democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd 
bentsen put aside negative partisan rhetoric as he finished a 
california swing friday telling high school students to work hard 
to shun drugs and to vote 
bentsen visited oakland tech a mostly black school which has 
raised its national test scores and community standing with the help 
of special programs for youths interested in health care and 
computers 
the fact that you are attending oakland tech means you have a 
bright future he said and the best way to destroy that future 
for all time is to become involved with drugs 
bentsen said he and michael dukakis the democratic presidential 
nominee would launch an effective fight against drugs but he also 
said that effort would not succeed unless students did their part 
when you come right down to it in an urban area like oakland 
the war on drugs in our schools will be won or lost by a series of 
millions of personal decisions made by students like you he said 
the texas senator returned to his home state later friday and 
attended a rally of about 500 supporters in austin bentsen 
defiantly held up a reprint of the 1948 chicago tribune that bore 
the frontpage headline dewey defeats truman and told the 
supporters thats the kind of comeback were looking forward to 
having 
bentsen was introduced at the california school rally by sen 
alan cranston dcalif and actor danny glover best known for his 
part in the movie lethal weapon 
glover who is black told the students packing the gymnasium 
that his mother now 93 was kept from voting by discriminatory 
practicies until she was 60 apathy was not acceptable he said 
too much blood has been shed to bring us to this point 
he said 
cranston turned to the presidential race saying of the 
republicans they think the campaign is over theyre back in the 
locker room 
bentsen who planned to vote absentee in texas this weekend to 
push a getoutthevote drive made no mention of george bush or dan 
quayle he urged the students to vote democratic if they are old 
enough to vote and to get their parents and friends to the voting 
booth 
the gymnasium walls were papered with signs welcoming bentsen 
including one picturing the schools bulldog mascot wearing a cowboy 
hat 
in the middle of his speech bentsen suddenly stopped as he 
noticed the scoreboard it was set up with the dukakisbentsen home 
team having 47 points the number of electoral votes in california 
and the bushquayle team with zero 
i just saw the score up there he said thats great it 
convinces me even more the best america is yet to come

and other body parts from pennsylvania was placed on two years 
probation friday fined 35200 and ordered to perform 1600 hours 
service in the citys prisons 
dr martin spector had pleaded no contest to charges that 
included theft of the body parts he received from morgue employees 
at the university of pennsylvania and jefferson hospitals 
spector an ear nose and throat specialist faced a maximum 
sentence of 8 to 17 years in prison 
spectors lawyer joel slomsky told common pleas judge mark 
bernstein his client was a dedicated doctor for nearly half a 
century and his motivation was continued medical research 
it was brought out that spector over the years had made about 
10000 sending ear bones and heads to research centers in colorado 
and elsewhere 
slomsky however while acknowledging that while spector violated 
the laws of pennsylvania said his client didnt realize what he was 
doing was illegal and what he received was minuscule 
the investigation began more than two years ago when united 
parcel service workers in louisville ky noticed something leaking 
from a foulsmelling package when they opened the box to repackage 
it they found human heads inside the box bore spectors return 
address 
spector was one of five people charged in the case three of four 
morgue workers have pleaded guilty and are on probation charges 
against the fourth worker were dismissed 
before imposing the sentence the judge told spector that your 
crime is the result of poor judgement a donated body should be 
respectfully treated and then properly interred no one can trample 
on the rights of those people in the name of science 
under pennsylvania law bodies can be donated to medical schools 
through a state affiliate knowns as the humanities gift registry 
spector refused to talk to reporters after leaving court

the government is considering almost doubling the 
share foreign companies can hold in joint ventures with soviet 
businesses in a major proposal to aid the ailing economy a western 
diplomat said friday 
under a jan 13 1987 decree of the council of ministers 
foreign partners now are limited to owning 49 percent of a joint 
venture and the soviet side 51 percent 
western businessmen said the restriction made it unprofitable for 
them to form joint ventures and they have been complaining to 
soviet officials for months 
a senior western diplomat involved in eastwest trade said the 
soviets are considering a firm proposal to allow the foreign 
partner to own 80 percent of the joint venture 
the diplomat spekaing on condition of anonymity said some 
soviet officials indicate the foreign partner may even be allowed to 
own more than 80 percent of the business 
he praised the soviets for acting on westerners complaints but 
said the principal problem with joint ventures remains restrictions 
on how profits can be taken out of the soviet union 
the soviet ruble cannot be converted into other currencies on 
world markets so foreign companies must devise ways of either 
earning convertible or hard currencies or taking out their 
share of the proceeds in soviet commodities 
the communist partys ruling politburo decided this month to make 
the ruble convertible gradually but no details have been released 
and it is believed such steps will take years 
increasing their share will give foreign partners more control 
over managing joint ventures and allow more westerners to be brought 
in as employees for the operations the diplomat said 
the proposed changes will have to be approved by the council of 
ministers and the supreme soviet the nominal parliament 
so far the soviet union has signed 108 joint ventures with 
foreign partners most with finnish and west german companies in 
addition american companies have signed six joint venture contracts 
with the soviets soviet officials have said 300400 joint ventures 
are under negotiation 
the soviets have been actively seeking joint business projects 
with capialist countries to help improve the quantity and quality of 
consumer goods and to earn convertible foreign currencies to pay for 
grain and other imports

complaining that the comic pages are for comedy not campaigning 
editors at a number of newspapers have refused to run installments 
of the cartoon strip cathy that are critical of the reaganbush 
administration 
we dont think that our comics page is the place for political 
endorsements on behalf of one party or the other said richard 
halicks executive editor of the messengerinquirer in owensboro ky 
his paper which has not yet made its presidential endorsement 
said it will not publish any strips that take partisan political 
stands 
other papers that have rejected the cathy installments are 
the denver post the evansville ind courier the union leader of 
manchester nh and the helena mont independent record the 
daily oklahoman went further dropping the strip permanently 
the oklahoma city papers managing editor frank boggs said its 
management decided to discontinue cathy for the same reason we 
dont carry doonesbury and we dont carry bloom county we 
dont pay cartoonists to do editorials 
the newspaper has endorsed republican vice president george bush 
for president over massachusetts gov michael dukakis a democrat 
the honolulu advertiser while not dropping cathy is not 
running the strips on its comic page at the advertiser we 
believe in cathys right to free speech well run sample 
endorsement strips tomorrow on the page opposite the editorial 
page its management said politics is getting plenty of space in 
the rest of the paper we dont want to spread it to the comic page 
too 
the paper has not made a presidential endorsement 
the cartoon strips criticisms are made by a character named 
andrea who lost her job after having a baby because her business 
did not offer maternity leave 
in fridays panels andrea complains the reaganbush 
administration has done nothing on several womens issues including 
equal pay day care or impoverished single mothers and yet she 
says many people think things are going pretty well 
the government she concludes is like a baby it looks 
like a little angel when its sleeping 
contacted at her home in los angeles the strips creator cathy 
guisewite said she anticipated her twoweek political series would 
generate controversy 
i knew people did not look for the strip to be political 
opinion she said noting that past strips dealt with the modern 
womans more personal problems from inattentive boyfriends to 
cellulite and the disastrous bathing suit 
but i felt it was in keeping with the strip to comment on 
womens issues that are at stake in this election i really searched 
my soul over drawing this strip i knew i would be offending some 
women readers i have who believe the extreme opposite 
universal press a newspaper features syndicate that handles 
cathy received several complaints since the political series 
began monday said editorial director lee salem 
but its that many complaints out of some 500 papers salem 
said i think that needs to be put into perspective 
ms guisewite said she was not really certain why newspapers 
would pull her strip and not others with a political point of view 
such as doonesbury but she said i think people are having 
problems with this series because i am coming out for a specific 
candidate 
at the evansville paper managing editor paul mcauliffe said 
we are trying to cure the problem of a cartoonist using our comics 
page to espouse a political view that is heavyhanded and in favor 
of one party over the other 
he said the courier was running two strips in the political 
series out of sequence friday and saturday and will substitute old 
cathy strips for six current ones 
the courier endorsed bush for president 
the union leader ran an advisory thursday on the comic page that 
said readers looking for the comic cathy will have to wait 
awhile several installments scheduled for this week and next take 
the strip into presidential political advocacy to an extent the 
editor feels oversteps the strips entertainment purpose 
cathy will return as soon as she gets off her soap box 
the union leaders own editorial writers endorsed bush

a boatload of vietnamese refugees that 
reportedly turned to cannibalism after being left adrift by a us 
navy ship werent able to tell of their desperate plight due to a 
language barrier an attorney said friday 
the vietnamese junk which originally carried 110 people had 
been at sea for 18 days when it met the navy ship when the boat was 
rescued 19 days later off the coast of the philippines it had only 
52 survivors officials said 
the commander of the uss dubuque capt alexander g balian 48 
has been relieved of duty in connection with the june 9 incident and 
the navy is reviewing an investigation to decide whether he should 
be courtmartialed 
dan donato jr civilian attorney for balian said the captain 
told the navy that the refugees were misled by an unidentified 
dubuque sailors inaccurate assertion that help was on the way 
in an effort to provide these people with some hope he told 
them that they would be picked up in a couple of days because the 
navy had contacted another ship to do that denato said 
he was of vietnamese extraction and perhaps spoke better 
vietnamese than english i think that was perhaps one of the 
problems donato said 
donatos comments at a news conference friday echoed statements 
in documents obtained by the los angeles times including balians 
account of the incident and navy charges against the captain 
crew members of the dubuque an amphibious ship gave water 
several hundred pounds of food and navigating equipment to the 
refugees aboard the junk after determining that the vessel appeared 
seaworthy donato said 
however that and other information was wrong he said 
the refugees told me that there were people below decks in bad 
need of food and perhaps near starvation said donato who spoke 
to a dozen survivors 
but their understanding of sick or injured didnt include 
starvation he added saying that crew was not advised of any 
starving refugees 
the crew and captain also thought the flatbottomed boat had been 
at sea for seven days when it actually had been out 18 days donato 
said 
survivors said a 12yearold boy and a 15yearold boy were 
murdered and eaten unidentified sources told the times a 
12yearold girl who died also was eaten by some of the refugees 
the paper said 
balian is charged with violating a general navy regulation of 
wrongfully failing to render assistance to the refugees 
the navy also alleges that balian was derelict in his duty and 
negligently failed to investigate sufficiently and give appropriate 
assistance 
a recommendation on whether charges will be brought in a 
courtmartial is expected within a week donato said an article 32 
hearing the equivalent of a grand jury proceeding was completed 
earlier this week he added 
donato said balian sought vital information about the refugees 
condition and the state of the ship and acted properly based upon 
the information he received from his crew 
he did make these determinations but unfortunately in the 
press of things and because of the chaotic situation he didnt get 
exactly the right information he said 
the dubuque was en route to the persian gulf and facing time 
constraints he said 
he had to make a decision as to what was required under the 
operational orders you also have to remember he was anxious he had 
to make 18 knots in order to get to the gulf by the assigned time 
donato said 
but he said balians decision wasnt influenced by scheduling 
balians navy attorney lt cmdr ron petronio said balian is 
currently in japan awaiting the navys recommendation 
donato said he expects some charges will be upheld but the 
decision for courtmartial is up to rear admiral geoffrey chesbrough 
at the subic bay naval base in the philippines

when they stole a vehicle to elude police in west germany 
this is the account matthes gave 
the two went to majorca in the western mediterranean where they 
stole a yacht worth more than 15 million but the engine promptly 
burned up 
undaunted they stole another yacht a short time later this time 
in portugal but first they broke into a store and stole a copying 
machine and a typewriter to forge the ships registration papers 
they found they could have saved themselves the effort when they 
cracked the ships safe they found all documents needed plus more 
than 5000 cash in british pounds 
the two fugitives generously handed out hundreds of bottles of 
expensive whiskey found on board to police officials and harbor 
authorities as they sailed around the region 
but they ran into trouble in tangier on the northernmost coast 
of morocco when the yachts propeller became entangled in mooring 
lines 
one of the men donned stolen underwater gear and freed the 
propeller then swam in front of the yacht to keep it clear cutting 
all mooring lines in his path through the harbor channel 
the result was total chaos in the harbor matthes said the 
fishermen were standing with knives at ready along the breaker 
walls 
the fugitives eluded the infuriated fishermen however and 
reached the open sea 
on spains grand canary island they decided to set up an aerial 
sightseeing business although neither had ever flown a plane they 
bought a rusting crop duster with money stolen from a currency 
exchange 
neither of them has a pilots license although i think one of 
them once sat next to his uncle in a cockpit when he was a child 
matthes said 
the test flight ended in a crashlanding but an experienced 
pilot congratulated them even on that saying i couldnt have 
landed here myself 
the yachtvoyaging ended when they ran into a storm while bound 
from tangier to the canary islands 
one man paddled to land on a life raft but he came ashore in a 
restricted military area was arrested and deported to west germany 
in august 
his companion managed to steer the yacht into the harbor and 
fled he turned up broke in west germany two months later and was 
arrested by police

bosses and associates of the genovese 
organized crime family held hidden interests in a condominium 
project in northeastern new jersey and paid the boroughs mayor 500 
a week to help build it according to an indictment unsealed friday 
the defendants set up at least seven companies some controlled 
by their wives to obscure the investors behind the 60unit shelter 
bay project in edgewater 
thomas tansey edgewaters mayor from 1980 to 1987 and now 
borough clerk was paid more than 70000 for two years to push for 
the project smooth its way and quash rivals the indictment said 
the organized crime figures also paid off tanseys gambling 
debts financed his home and vacations and paid for an atlantic city 
hotel room according to the charges tansey denied the allegations 
the indictment returned thursday said defendant donald ivaldi of 
englewood controlled the shelter bay plot despite declaring 
bankruptcy in the late 1970s defendant milton parness a convicted 
swindler from edgewater offered to help in developing the property 
in exchange for a share of the business it said 
past problems meant they could not obtain bank financing so they 
brought genovese secondincommand matthew matty the horse 
ianniello into their venture the court papers said 
ianniello shared his stake with nowretired and jailed

construction industry bidrigging scheme 
ianniello ivaldi and parness were accused with salerno and

democrat michael dukakis called the dwindling days before the 
election a political eternity with enough time to pull off an 
upset while republican rival george bush accused him on friday of 
wanting to torpedo the prosperity 
the democrat said the race was tightening up all over the 
country and he said that bush leading in the polls with 11 days 
to go was hiding in his little cocoon with advisers afraid to 
let him engage in news programs giveandtake while dukakis has 
been appearing on many such programs 
bush speaking to a group of businessmen in los angeles said 
that as americans step into voting booths they should keep peace 
and prosperity in mind 
peace means you can sleep at night knowing the world will still 
be there in the morning prosperity means you can sleep at night 
knowing that opportunity will still be there in the morning the 
vice president said 
despite a pledge to shun negative campaigning between now and the 
election bush also stayed on the attack warning that dukakis 
wants to torpedo the prosperity weve worked so hard to achieve 
i ask you to consider what kind of morning would electing the 
liberal governor of massachusetts bring will it be gloomy bush 
asked will the dark clouds of pessimism and limited possibility 
obscure our vision 
bush also disputed dukakis assertion that american families have 
been able to keep up financially only because more women have been 
working outside their homes 
frankly that strikes me as sexist because it implies that 
women wouldnt work unless they had to the gop presidential 
nominee said 
bush also spoke at the california highway patrol academy in 
sacramento and received endorsements from the california 
correctional peace officers association and the international 
association of correctional officers 
in his remarks there he said you might almost say that the 
democratic party today suffers from a split personality with a rank 
and file made up of some of the best of america the silent 
majority but the leadership much of it is a remnant of the 
60s the new left those campus radicals grown old the peace 
marchers and the nuclear freeze activists 
dukakis wound up a trip to missouri suggesting his campaign could 
be struck by the same political lightning that returned favorite son 
harry truman to the white house in 1948 
in politics as you all know 11 days is an eternity dukakis 
said at a morning rally at a kansas city baptist church before he 
flew to detroit there is time to do it 
trumans name has been invoked by both sides in the campaign but 
the late presidents soninlaw said friday the republicans cannot 
lay claim to his memory 
clifton daniel who married margaret truman said president 
reagan was talking nonsense when he said the feisty democrat 
would be a republican if he were alive today 
president truman would shoot himself before he became a 
republican daniel said in an interview with an iowa radio station 
top campaign official john sasso told reporters that polls taken 
by the campaign showed dukakis gaining nationally this week and 
drawing within four points in the important state of california 
independent polls have shown national bush leads of eight to 15 
points but sasso said there is measurable movement this week in 
dukakis direction he declined to give exact numbers but said the 
margin of error was five points in the surveys 
dukakis trip to the detroit suburbs brought him to within a few 
miles of the factory where the helmeted candidates ride in a tank a 
few weeks ago to show his support for building up conventional 
forces turned into a public relations disaster the republicans 
even used film of it in a commercial to ridicule him 
meanwhile sen lloyd bentsen dukakis vice presidential running 
mate was drawing upon the memory of fellow texan lyndon johnson 
whose presidential library in austin was the site for an evening 
campaign rally 
earlier bentsen told students at oakland tech a mostly black 
school with a record of academic achievement in oakland calif to 
apply their talent stay away from drugs and vote 
when you come right down to it in an urban area like oakland 
the war on drugs in our schools will be won or lost by a series of 
millions of personal decisions made by students like you bentsen 
said 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle took a bus 
tour through pennsylvania trying to avert complacency that could 
keep his tickets supporters from going to the polls on nov 8 
were not taking anything for granted he said

just eight weeks after floridas 551 
million jackpot eclipsed lottomania in california the golden state 
is back with a 55 millionplus jackpot that will be north americas 
richest ever 
lottery officials and merchants said ticket sales for saturdays 
drawing already were double what an average thursday would rake in 
the official estimate of over 55 million for the drawing is 
conservative based on previous betting patterns in the twoyear 
history of californias computerized lottery game said lottery 
spokesman bob taylor 
over 55 million could mean several million dollars over 
officials acknowledge 
it all depends on how wildly californians react to the 
1in14million chance of winning the jackpot which would be paid 
in an annuity of at least 275 million before taxes for 20 years 
for the cost of a 1 lotto ticket 
the size of the jackpot depends on sales and jackpot rollovers 
which fuel each other to produce the heavy gambling periods dubbed 
lottomania 
when no one picks all six winning numbers out of a choice of 49 
numbers the jackpot is rolled over or added to the top prize for 
the next twiceweekly drawing four rollovers including a 334 
million jackpot wednesday night produced the current record prize 
estimate 
the exact size of the jackpot depends on how many tickets are 
sold twenty cents of every 1 ticket feeds the jackpot 
the california lottery produced a 514 million jackpot north 
americas largest at the time in june it was evenly split between 
two players an aircraft mechanic and a supermarket clerk 
that record was eclipsed sept 3 by a 551 million prize in 
florida that went to a 63yearold real estate broker

a nuclear plant in western japan leaked radiation 
into the air but not enough to contaminate the environment a 
company official said thursday 
the leak was in the ohi no 1 plant in fukui region about 200 
miles west of tokyo an official of kansai electric co said on 
condition of anonymity the amount of radiation still was being 
measured 
he said the leak was detected when an above average amount of 
radiation was measured in the 118 millionkilowatt plant during 
testing of a valve in the steam generator 
radioactive water leaked into a separate circuit of water used to 
condense the steam after it has driven the electricityproducing 
turbines the leak could have come from a tiny hole in the pipes 
but had nothing to do with the valve test he said 
some radiation was released into the air but should not reach a 
level that will contaminate the environment the official said 
a radiation leak occurred at the plant in september 1981 when a 
pipe was punctured the official said 
japans 35 nuclear reactors supply about 29 percent of the 
nations electricity according to government figures fukui has 12 
nuclear power plants

wheel well door on sept 21 forcing the plane to land with only its 
nose landing gear extended the 88 passengers and crew evacuated the 
plane by emergency slide three people suffered minor injuries 
problems with the pivot trunnion the part of the landing gear 
door that failed prompted boeing to issue a service bulletin in 
march 
the national transportation safety board reported that the 
federal aviation administration then issued an airworthiness 
directive concerning the problems eight days before the accident 
boeing was aware of the problem the faa was aware of the 
problem and american airlines was aware of the problem ntsb 
investigator warren wandel said 
american spokesman jim brown said the airline had instituted an 
inspection program for pivot trunnions on all its 727s after the

the chairman of the afghan rebel 
alliance said thursday that the soviets are deploying new 
highaltitude bombers and longrange artillery into afghanistan 
despite their declared plans to withdraw 
burhanuddin rabbani leader of the hardline jamiatiislami 
faction and present chairman of the sevenparty mujahedeen holy 
warrior alliance said he received the first reports of the new 
weaponry monday he said additional reports confirmed them on 
thursday 
the reports could not be immediately confirmed but jamiat has 
proved a relatively reliable source of war news in the past 
this is a dangerous new political and military situation 
rabbani told reporters in the pakistani capital 
he said the bombers were identified as tu16s known as badgers 
in the parlance of the north atlantic treaty organization they are 
among the largest twinengine bombers ever built 
rabbani said his antimarxist islamic guerrillas also reported 
seeing new highaltitude jet fighters but he could not identify the 
type 
he said the aircraft bearing soviet markings were observed at 
the big soviet air base at bagram in northeast afghanistan and at 
shindand air base in the west 
the rebel leader said there also were unconfirmed sightings of 
the planes at kabul airport which doubles as an air force base 
rabbani said the only logical use of such aircraft was to conduct 
saturation bombing from inside afghanistan previously the soviets 
have flown the planes from inside the soviet union to bomb guerrilla 
positions in northern afghanistan 
he said he also received numerous reports of new bm41 longrange 
artillery and a new type of mine distribution device 
the bm41 cannot be used against mujahedeen positions in the 
mountains because they cannot be aimed that high rabbani said 
their only use would be against civilian targets 
moscow recently hinted it might alter its pullout timetable from 
afghanistan because of alleged interference by pakistan and the 
united states 
the rebels armed mainly by washington operate from bases inside 
pakistan 
under a unsponsored accord singed in geneva last spring 
moscow agreed to withdraw its more than 100000 troops from 
afghanistan between may 15 and next feb 15 the rebels did not take 
part in those negotiations but were represented by pakistan 
united nations observers said the kremlin met its pledge to 
complete the removal of half of the troops by aug 15 but no major 
soviet troop withdrawals have taken place since then 
the rebels claim to have taken five of about 30 provincial 
capitals since the pullout began and have begun hammering kabul 
the afghan capital with rockets almost daily 
the government has claimed steady military victories over the 
guerrillas 
rabbani reiterated the rebels offer to negotiate peace directly 
with moscow they refuse to discuss terms with the afghan 
government which they see only as soviet puppets 
we do not wish to disturb the soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan in fact we wish to facilitate their speed rabbani

it is possible a good even insightful play 
about yuppies 
richard greenberg draws a persuasive portrait of the 
muchmaligned ypeople in eastern standard his new comedydrama 
that opened thursday at offbroadways manhattan theater club 
alternately compassionate and caustic funny and sad eastern 
standard marks the arrival of a major playwrighting talent who has 
been percolating on the theater scene for several years greenberg 
is best known to new york theatergoers for several oneact plays 
particularly life under water and the authors voice as 
well as the maderati an examination of new yorks trendy young 
literary set 
with eastern standard the playwright tackles bigger more 
ambitious themes he mixes his materialistic and upwardly mobile 
characters with such uptotheminute social concerns as the 
homeless and aids it makes for an intriguing theatrical 
confrontation as his complaisant people face some unpleasant aspects 
of their society as well as their own social conventions 
greenbergs hero is a nice wellmeaning architect named stephen 
dylan baker hes a quivering neurotic who has just attempted 
suicide because he hates designing big buildings that are destroying 
the quality of life in new york but stephen also has more troubles 
for some time he has been trailing a female stockbroker a creature 
he worships from afar or at least from the next table in a 
manhattan restaurant where the first act of eastern standard 
takes place 
stephen tells his troubles to his best friend a gay artist named 
drew peter frechette they watch the stockbroker named phoebe 
patricia clarkson arrive and be greeted by a man who turns out to 
be her brother peter kevin conroy the brother a television 
producer is also gay and it turns out is dying of aids 
the plot turns on a foulmouthed bag lady who causes a ruckus in 
the restaurant since shes played by the feisty anne meara its a 
spirited and funny assault that brings everyone together including 
the waitress barbara garrick 
by act 2 these six people including the bag lady have become 
friends even sharing stephens long island summer home by then 
obsession has turned to love with phoebe falling for stephen and 
peter finding himself attracted to drew 
but there are drawbacks phoebes continuing relationship with 
an unsavory old flame peters knowledge that his fatal illness 
could also kill drew the waitress opportunistic attraction to 
stephen the bag lady isnt all she seems to be either stealing 
away in the middle of the night with everyones jewelry and wallets 
greenbergs characters flounder when first faced with these 
adversities but eventually their doubts about life and about their 
own abilities give them strength its part of the plays pleasure 
to watch the characters work their way back to some kind of 
accommodation with the real world 
director michael engler uses a series of sliding black panels 
instead of a curtain to close each scene it feels cinematic an 
effect enhanced by the theaters wide low stage engler handles the 
actors well too and doesnt allow any performer to dominate the 
action 
as the troubled architect dylan baker has the most difficult 
role he must remain sympathetic and ineffectual for most of the 
evening baker does both peter frechette as the gay painter gets 
the plays best laughs and he seizes them in such an expert way 
that they dont undermine his character 
patricia clarkson displays the compulsion that makes her 
ambitious stockbroker seem real while kevin conroy manages his role 
as the dying brother with an unnerving dignity barbara garrick has 
less to work with as the waitress the plays most enigmatic role 
and you are never sure if she is on any side but her own 
philipp jungs restaurant setting is only generic but his beach 
house captures the flavor of a yuppie nevernever land where nothing 
can go wrong 
eastern standard ultimately is a play about growing up 
adapting to and finally celebrating life no matter what it brings 
as stephen says in a poignant toast that ends the play to all the 
disappointments which are inevitable and compromises which are 
legion and lies which are our daily bread and to the sadly 
infrequent accidental happinesses of all the rest of our lives

pushing elementaryage children into rigorous 
study in the name of reform is doing more harm than good warns a 
new report that lays part of the blame on global economic pressures 
that have aroused competitive fervor 
recent reforms aimed at making students more accountable and 
diligent may make sense for high schoolers but often produce only 
shortterm gains when applied to younger children and may actually 
burn them out said the report being released today in chicago at 
the annual convention of the national association of state boards of 
education 
the study right from the start the report of the nasbe task 
force on early childhood education urges states instead to 
encourage formation of early childhood units catering to the 
special developmental needs of 48 yearolds 
the legitimate concern about the link between our economic 
future and the quality of schooling has fostered a competitive 
mentality for our educational enterprise with unfortunate 
consequences for early segments of schooling the report said

the former cia chief who documented security 
problems at the new us embassy in moscow says president reagans 
recommendation that the building be razed and rebuilt shows 
reality caught up with us 
the united states has tended to be complacent over the years 
about soviet technology said james schlesinger the former 
defense secretary and cia director whom reagan commissioned to study 
the embassy in this case soviet technology turned out to be 
immensely and impressively sophisticated 
reagan on thursday said he wanted to erect a new 
americanbuilt embassy in moscow in place of the virtually 
completed eightstory us building because of the many listening 
devices that were built into it 
a state department source said the government had filed claims 
against the soviet union for 29 million in connection with 
defects and delays in the embassy construction

relatives of people killed in airline 
disasters receive less than half the compensation they should and 
the legal system gives the industry little incentive to improve 
safety a rand corp study concludes 
compensation in aviation cases is neither fair nor adequate 
said economist james p smith principal author of the study that 
surveyed claims and lawsuits involving 2228 deaths in 25 crashes 
involving us airlines between 1970 and 1984 
its not adequate in that people dont receive full 
compensation for their loss its not fair because people with 
identical losses receive very different amounts he said 
the study by rands institute for civil justice was criticized as 
misleading by trade associations for plane manufacturers and 
airlines which had paid onethird of its 13 million cost

in the first test of a new tougher trade law 
the reagan administration on friday rejected a request from us 
rice farmers that it launch an investigation into charges that the 
japanese government is unfairly blocking rice imports into that 
country 
the announcement by us trade representative clayton yeutter 
came as something of a surprise because supporters of the petition 
were hoping the pressure of presidential politics would force a 
different outcome 
yeutter called japans barriers against rice imports 
intolerable but he said he believed the matter could be better 
handled through a new round of trade negotiations now being carried 
out under the 97nation general agreement on tariffs and trade 
rather than in direct confrontation 
the administration had rejected a similar petition in 1986 
because it wanted to give tokyo time to negotiate changes in its ban 
on rice imports

frances labor unions feeble in membership 
splintered in politics have kept a knack for grabbing attention 
and embarrassing governments 
a day of action oct 20 by public employees dominated the 
news and put pressure on the government of premier michel rocard a 
socialist to do something to restore what is known as social 
peace 
workers thronged paris wide boulevards marching under angry 
banners by the tens of thousands teachers closed their books 
postmen dropped their mailbags and transit passengers were left 
crowded on train and subway platforms waiting for the occasional 
ride 
union leaders said they would consider stepping up the pressure 
for pay raises with more strikes 
the impression is of a powerful and united labor movement but 
the reality is five national federations split along political 
lines all suffering from falling membership and accused of losing 
touch with the workers 
its a very complicated movement said rene mouriaux who 
specializes in unions at the parisbased center for the study of 
french political life 
it has the lowest rate of union membership in europe but the 
ability to mobilize people is relatively great he said in an 
interview they have an ability to make themselves heard that goes 
beyond their ability to organize 
reliable figures on membership are scarce the claims by the 
different union federations are widely believed to be overstated 
mouriaux said the best estimate he could offer after extensive 
study was that 9 percent to 13 percent of frances 178 million 
salaried workers have union cards 
stateowned enterprises and the civil service are much more 
heavily organized than private business but any precise figures on 
the breakdown are poetry he said rather than science 
as membership dwindles union leaders more frequently lose 
control of angry workers many recent strikes including one by 
nurses have been led by adhoc committees bypassing the existing 
unions who counseled patience 
roughly onefourth of union members belong to the communistled 
general confederation of labor known by its french initials cgt it 
claimed 16 million active and retired members in 1983 the last 
time it disclosed a figure but the independent newspaper le monde 
estimated the cgts real membership then at about 890000 
the secondbiggest union is the french democratic confederation 
of labor cftd close to the socialists followed by workers force 
fo which broke from the cgt when the latter became 
communistdominated in the late 1940s the general confederation of 
cadres cgc made up mostly of technicians engineers and 
middlemanagement and the french confederation of christian workers 
cfdc no longer strictly religious 
most singleprofession unions are affiliated with one of the big 
federations with the notable exception of the powerful national 
education federation which is dominant among public school teachers 
the cgt has maintained its leadership even while support for the 
french communist party has dwindled to less than 10 percent of the 
electorate from its postwar position as the strongest party on the 
left 
the cgts reputation as the toughest union taking the hardest 
line against the companies and the government attracts workers who 
would never vote communist 
but even the cgt has suffered in the past 15 years especially 
from widespread layoffs in the hardhit industries that used to be 
its strongholds the mines shipyards and steelworks 
although membership is low unions have a secure place in french 
law union representatives are involved in managing the social 
security system negotiating national contracts and in enterprise 
committees that large businesses are required to establish 
in the current standoff the unions are demanding 
acrosstheboard wage increases for public employees to keep up with 
the cost of living while the government says no money will be 
available before next year 
the situation is all the more uncomfortable for the socialists 
who took over the government in may from conservative premier 
jacques chirac the union members overwhelmingly vote socialist and 
socialist leaders are more at ease supporting the union demands 
the left in power finds itself on both sides of the 
barricades the leftist newspaper liberation wrote recently the 
socialists are in a good position to understand the appeal of the 
civil servants these constitute their natural sociological domain 
reservoir of voters but also of activists and leaders 
while there are sometimes long strikes in private industry 
french unions are betterknown for work stoppages lasting one day at 
a time or even less intended as a show of force during 
negotiations rather than as a final blow when talks have failed 
workers who provide essential services such as nurses and 
airtraffic controllers are required to provide a minimum level of 
service even when they strike 
rarely does business come completely to a halt

within the limits of this sleepy 
conservative farming community chiles top labor leader resides in 
courtordered internal exile that has been criticized even by his 
foes in big business 
manuel bustos president of the workers united central chiles 
main trade union confederation was driven in a police car late on 
the night of sept 15 from the capital city santiago to parral 
210 miles to the south he hasnt stepped outside the town since and 
legally cannot until february 1990 
his confinement has been denounced by labor and human rights 
organizations worldwide 
appeals for his release rose in number and volume after voters in 
a yesorno referendum oct 5 rejected gen augusto pinochets bid 
to remain on as chiles president until 1997 
bustos a 42yearold textile worker harbors hopes that 
pinochets ballotbox loss will bring him freedom soon 
maybe during the christmas season there will be an amnesty 
he said in an interview at least i can have my illusions cant 
i 
his sentence of 541 days relegation to parral was ordered by 
the supreme court which convicted him and other confederation 
leaders of violating internal security laws by calling a general 
strike that turned violent a little more than a year ago 
the court ordered an identical sentence for the confederations 
vice president arturo martinez who is confined to chanaral a town 
in northern chile 
following pinochets defeat in the oct 5 referendum a 16party 
opposition coalition called for the release of bustos and martinez 
leading businessmen including several who had supported pinochet 
echoed the appeal 
manuel feliu president of the production and commerce 
federation a national business organization said an amnesty for 
the two labor leaders would be a sign of grandeur and of 
reconciliation which is what the country needs now 
bustos said felius statement reflects the realization by 
businessmen that elected rule will bring an end to what he described 
as probusiness labor laws they enjoyed under pinochet 
pinochet remains as president but must step down in 1990 after an 
open presidential election 
they now see that the time is getting close when things are 
going to have to change some bustos said theyre a little 
anxious to start some kind of dialogue 
he accused business leaders of being twofaced calling for 
reforms in a publicity bid for workers sympathies while using and 
abusing the current laws 
change is going to come whether they like it or not he 
added 
upon seizing power in a bloody 1973 coup pinochet dismantled the 
countrys powerful mostly leftistled labor unions leaders were 
imprisoned expelled and in several cases tortured and killed 
pinochets military government drafted laws that prohibit 
industrywide collective bargaining limiting salary negotiations to 
individual locals 
strikes are illegal in a wide range of industries considered 
strategic including copper mining which provides up to half the 
countrys export income in areas where strikes are permitted law 
requires that bargaining follow a strict timetable and be conluded 
within 60 days if not the companys original contract goes back 
into effect 
several international and foreign organizations have criticized 
the laws as unfair including the us government which last year 
suspended chiles special trade status because of restrictions 
against organized labor 
bustos said businessmen also realize that a genuine dialogue with 
labor cannot begin until his and martinez internal exile ends 
these relegations are an obstacle to conversations and tend 
to make the confederation more radical he said 
bustos is a member of the christian democratic party the 
countrys largest political organization although he backs a 
leftofcenter faction of the party and has often taken a strongly 
combative stance against the pinochet government he is considered 
politically moderate in comparison with many other labor activists 
i believe the only way you can reach an understanding with 
people is through conversation he said i have always tried to 
talk with business leaders 
bustos does not rule out demonstrations or perhaps a general 
strike by workers however if pinochet fails to respond promptly to 
opposition calls for democratic concessions 
we have to think about an orderly mobilization to warn the 
regime that indeed we have strength he said 
during his first weeks in internal exile a regular stream of 
visitors including labor leaders and journalists have called at 
the workingclass residence of a local roman catholic priest where 
bustos is staying his wife a journalist in santiago comes each 
weekend with his 5yearold son he said the couple also has two 
teenage daughters 
he has become involved in protecting the rights of workers in the 
parral area where there are some 7000 workers and not one single 
union he said he plans to open an office with a secretary and a 
lawyer to represent workers in suits against employers 
ive kept busy he said i brought a book with me and in 
all this time i still havent finished it 
he said the book was about recent social reforms in the soviet 
union

the makers of the cbs version of the hit movie 
dirty dancing can at least brag that they have successfully 
adapted a simplistic clicheridden movie into a simplistic 
clicheridden television series 
dirty dancing premieres saturday with a onehour episode 
then continues as a halfhour show 
the movie a variation on the worn 
richgirlfallsforsexyboyfromwrongsideoftracks plot was a 
hit thanks to hot dancing great early 60s music and two charming 
stars jennifer grey and patrick swayze the tv series has some good 
music and dancing and at least one charming star melora hardin in 
the grey role as baby 
in the movie the plot was an excuse for loads of scenes of 
sensuous dancers writhing to hits from the 60s on tv choreography 
is money so theres less dance more talk 
to allow for a continuing plotline the series has the option of 
going beyond summer vacation since baby hardin is no longer the 
daughter of a vacationing doctor but the daughter of the divorced 
owner of the resort max kellerman mclean stevenson 
hardin has a winning presence but patrick cassidy has a long way 
to go to live up to patrick swayze in the role of johnny swayze 
managed to give the guy some depth despite the movies ankledeep 
plot 
cassidys johnny is a selfcentered humorless dunce who dances 
around alone in his room rubbing his body granted cassidy didnt 
write or direct such scenes but swayze didnt exactly have 
macbeth to work with either 
in the opener baby arrives to spend the summer getting to know 
dad wandering about she discovers johnnys dancers rehearsing one 
of their hot numbers johnny drops his partner and ogles baby 
dad stumbles in and gives baby the job of talent coordinator 
johnnys job for the resorts stage show johnny is miffed 
conflict no 1 with many more to come 
dad is suspicious about johnnys secretive rehearsals but baby 
good sport that she is persuades him to let the dancers continue 
pleading dad youve got to give them a chance there are a lot 
of lines like dad youve got to give them a chance and all 
i know is you cant give up 
after dad departs baby brags that she has taken ballet so 
johnny sets her up to make a fool of herself by insisting she join 
the dancers he eventually convinces her that her only purpose in 
life is to defy her father and dance in the stage show so they 
sneak around at night to practice 
meanwhile penny constance marie johnnys jealous latin dance 
partner fumes and baby pretends interest in neil charles 
stratton the lifeguard her father approves of mandy ingber 
replaces the obnoxious sister of the movie as babys witless cousin 
robin 
choreographer kenny ortega has done a good job with the dancing 
too bad there isnt more of it and too bad the writers and director 
tony bill did not more effectively build the rudimentary suspense 
that fuels the central cliche in the premiere the opening of the 
big show and babys surprise appearance 
by the end of the opener everything seems to be tied up quite 
nicely but this is weekly television where concepts must be run 
into the ground 
will dad come to terms with babys newfound independence will 
baby and johnny get it on before penny gets baby 
shut up and dance

chris mills reacts the way many 14yearolds 
would upon being told that his parents are getting a divorce he is 
angry 
but chris doesnt just get mad he gets a lawyer 
necessary parties a witty and intelligent treatment of 
childrens feelings about divorce stars alan arkin as the boys 
eccentric attorney it was cowritten for the screen by arkin and 
his wife barbara dana based on her book of the same name 
the twohour twopart comedydrama premiering nov 5 and 
concluding nov 12 is the season opener for pbs critically 
acclaimed anthology series for young people wonderworks 
the film announces its sensitivity and humor right away in the 
opening scene chris mark paul gosselaar and his 6yearold 
sister jenny taylor fry are puttering in the kitchen trying to 
ignore the screaming and slamming by their quarreling parents julie 
hagerty and geoffrey pierson so many doors sighs little jenny 
later chris watches his parents squabble during a tennis doubles 
match the car pulls away the parents still arguing i heart 
tennis says the bumper sticker 
chris refuses to accept his parents decision to split convinced 
they are going through some kind of a phase hes also worried about 
the effect of the split on jenny who retreats into a coidentity 
with her stuffed rabbit bunny the child is almost too darling but 
her dialogue is really good 
they made up their minds to a stupid way and who will take 
care of bunny she wonders 
meanwhile chris friends from broken homes advise him to accept 
the split you can get more attention and presents than you ever 
had counsels haverman judd trichter its called guilt 
undeterred chris enlists archie corelli an idealist who quit 
the law for the more equitable profession of auto mechanic to press 
his case in court archie tries to argue chris out of a hopeless 
question but eventually he agrees to represent him 
meanwhile chris mother struggles to cope and his father comes 
by to talk to chris about why the family must break up im 
lost he says im 41 and i dont know who i am 
at the end of part 1 chris and archie are bounding up the steps 
of the courthouse to try to get chris admitted as a party to the 
divorce proceedings 
in part 2 archie searches for a legal ground for chris 
intervention in the case desperate he sits and watches peoples 
court for ideas jenny takes to wearing earmuffs to keep out talk 
of divorce although offers of ice cream come through loud and clear 
chris mom signs him up for group counseling for children whose 
parents have split up and how are you dealing with your parents 
divorce queries the counselor played by adam arkin im suing 
them chris replies matteroffactly 
the movie seems to be something of an arkin family project dana 
plays archies girlfriend adam and anthony arkin have small parts 
the arkins other son matthew is listed as production attorney 
the final scenes in the divorce hearing tend to get a little 
maudlin there are also some superfluous scenes that make the second 
half a tad draggy for instance eccentric grampa mills donald 
moffat doesnt seem to serve much purpose other than acting as 
chris legal guardian at the court proceedings 
despite minor flaws this is a wellproduced and doggedly earnest 
endeavor with a definite point of view marriage is a struggle and 
divorce should be a a convenience as archie tells chris youve 
got a point and youre gonna make some people think

the chinese government is applying the brakes to 
the marketbased economy it has fostered over the last 10 years but 
now finds overheated and growing too fast government control is 
back in style 
inflation is 20 percent even by conservative official estimates 
money supply is up an astonishing 40 percent local governments 
ignoring austerity orders from beijing are throwing money at new 
projects and contributing to an unsustainable industrial growth rate 
of 20 percent 
corruption is rife particularly among local officials taking 
advantage of a twotiered pricing system to obtain hardtoget 
materials at low stateset prices and resell them for huge gains on 
the free or black markets 
the last straw came in august when rumors of new price increases 
caused panic buying and runs on banks in several major cities 
the economy is growing so fast with a 45 percent jump in 
investment in capital construction that many factories are closed 
three days a week because of electricity shortages the communist 
party central committee in a plenary session in late september put 
new reform initiatives on hold the party said the next two years 
would be devoted to restoring control of the economic environment 
and rectifying economic order 
officials are assuring foreign investors and businesses however 
that the original terms of their contracts will still be honored 
the new policies were seen as a sign that premier li peng who 
has a reputation as being cautious has gained a larger say in 
decisions the headlong reform drive advocated by party leader zhao 
ziyang appears discredited although early reports that he was in 
political trouble have not been substantiated 
over the past decade the government has given provinces cities 
and special economic zones more authority to spend their own 
revenues borrow money abroad conduct trade and approve development 
projects 
the chinese are reacting to this economic crisis in the way 
they know best said one western economist in beijing by 
straight intervention 
among the more important measures 
prices plans to decontrol prices of steel and other basic 
materials have been shelved and government price controls have been 
reestablished over a wide range of consumer goods price ceilings 
will be set for grain sold on the free market and prices of other 
items prized by speculators such as fertilizers and pesticides 
will be regulated price inspectors will fan out around the country 
to monitor market activities premier li said the twotiered pricing 
system will remain for quite a long time 
bankinginvestment bank loans to industrial and construction 
projects outside the state plan and to nonprofitable companies are 
being frozen loans to foreign joint ventures will not be affected 
officials say 
the government will investigate and may close many of the 
estimated 500 littleregulated finance companies that have sprung up 
in recent years and are a primary source of reckless lending 
hundreds of staterun trade and investment firms also face closure 
for illegal profiteering rackets 
in one celebrated case the government removed trading and tax 
privileges from the kang hua development corp a rapidly expanding 
investment firm with links to deng pufang the son of senior leader 
deng xiaoping 
construction construction of office buildings auditoriums and 
hotels is to be halted except for projects already approved by 
planning authorities in beijing and a two to threeyear ban on 
starting such buildings has been imposed 
public spending the state council chinas cabinet increased 
from 19 to 29 the number of items that public offices can purchase 
only after receiving approval from above the list includes cars 
air conditioners and video recorders 
public offices buying imported cars and televisions will be 
slapped with a 40 percent surcharge and 20 percent tax was put on 
banquets using public funds government employees are forbidden to 
stay in highclass hotels or to offer cigarettes and wine to guests 
corruption the government set up 27 special teams to mount a 
nationwide fourmonth campaign on cheating tax evasion 
profiteering and illegal payment of bonuses 
the government has acted twice before in the past decade most 
recently in 1985 to cool off an overheated economy in both cases 
results were mixed and local officials soon reverted to ignoring 
faraway beijing 
despite government orders to reduce all public spending by 20 
percent this year such spending is up by 20 percent 
premier li in a speech sept 30 emphasized that this time 
orders must be obeyed and prohibitions observed it is absolutely 
impermissible for each to go his own way 
however chinese officials stress and foreign economists 
generally agree that the revival of controls is temporary and 
china will proceed with its marketoriented reforms once the current 
economic crisis is overcome 
the western economist speaking on condition of anonymity noted 
that the government continues to push such reform ideas as selling 
stocks in staterun companies and freeing enterprises from 
bureaucratic interference 
theres no indication that somehow they think central planning 
is the way he said

chinese officials are taking pains to assure 
foreign businesses that their contracts will be honored despite 
plans to slash domestic spending and shut down hundreds of domestic 
companies 
chinas handling of its latest austerity drive the third since 
it opened to foreign trade and investment in 1978 shows a new 
awareness of the need to temper the effect of policy swings and 
avoid frightening away foreign investors considered key to 
development 
premier li peng vice premier tian jiyun trade minister zheng 
tuobin and the bank of china all have promised in recent weeks that 
chinas 9700 foreign joint ventures will be exempt from austerity 
measures intended to stem a 20percent inflation 
all signed contracts for ordering goods and joint ventures will 
be implemented li told about 200 visiting chief executive 
officers of american companies on oct 17 he repeated the same 
message later in the week to a japanese banking delegation 
the bank of china the chief chinese lender to joint ventures 
said it will continue doing so 
one of chinas leading investment and trade companies the kang 
hua development corp which has been stripped of trade rights and 
ordered to divest many subsidiaries as punishment for illegal 
operations promised it will carry out all contracts already signed 
with foreign companies 
kang hua has signed about 4000 import and export contracts worth 
a total of 670 million since being founded 17 months ago 
the assurances seem to be having their desired effect foreign 
businessmen and diplomats in beijing said they expect a drop in 
chinese import orders but not a significant reduction in joint 
venture activity most seemed confident the impact would be minimal 
one predicted delays in signing new contracts however as the 
central government scrutinizes local projects more closely to weed 
out any not deemed essential 
chinese officials say consumption and industrial growth must be 
slowed and beijing must reassert central control over the economy to 
restore order to a market in which excessive demand has generated 
inflation hoarding and black marketeering 
foreign companies that sell factory equipment raw materials and 
luxuries to china from cars to air conditioners can expect a drop 
in orders import taxes on a wide range of goods have been increased 
and calls have been issued for import substitution where possible 
however premier li told the chief executive officers that china 
remains interested in joint projects in energy transportation 
communications raw material production and hightechnology 
foreign companies that want to manufacture consumer appliances in 
china such as televisions and refrigerators are welcome only if 
their products are for export li said 
the government also has said the construction of hotels 
auditoriums and other public buildings will be sharply curtailed 
companies found guilty of illegal transactions such as buying and 
selling scarce goods on the black market will be closed and 
companies set up by government offices will be shut down or spun off 
specifics such as which projects will be halted and which 
chinese companies reorganized or closed have been slow to emerge 
and foreign businessmen said it was too early to predict the 
eventual impact there have been no reports of casualties in the 
form of canceled contract talks 
the government also ordered slowdowns in economic growth in 1980 
and 1985 when it ran short of foreign currency reserves needed for 
imports some joint ventures were halted in midstream or canceled 
as were many import orders 
at that time the chinese had no cash said a western 
diplomat now its different they have the cash theyre trying

sigurd fafnerbane thrust his sword into 
the dragon roasted its heart over an open fire and rode away with 
the gold 
so goes a swedish legend carved on a runestone in eskilstuna it 
will probably survive for generations to come if only because the 
massive stone is too big to steal 
however archaeological experts are worried about other 
runestones 
more and more runestones are getting stolen said jan peder 
lamm of the national historical museum they are incredibly badly 
watched but then nobody could ever imagine anyone would want to 
steal them 
the stones get their name from runes ancient characters used in 
teutonic anglosaxon and scandinavian inscriptions believed to 
date back about 1700 years 
myths poems and the first traces of national history appear on 
3500 known runestones scattered over the swedish countryside 
the collectors value or rather the value of curiosity is 
booming said lamm 
lamm said it was impossible to estimate the worth of a runestone 
because there has never been a market for them many of the missing 
stones are actually fragments which have lain undisturbed for 
centuries in pastures and churchyards 
an entire stone can weigh nearly a ton 
the extent of the thefts is also impossible to determine lamm 
said because authorities do not have the money or personnel to 
conduct a detailed search 
we just recently realized that they were disappearing said 
lamm 
the newspaper dagens nyheter reported recently that three 
historically valuable fragments from about the year 1000 were 
missing from a church on the island of oland stones and other 
artifacts have also been taken from an unguarded collection at vreta 
cloister in southeastern sweden 
every runstone is registered and welldocumented lamm said 
so from a scientific point of view it is no catastrophe if they 
are stolen we have all the information down on computers 
he added however that the situation is still serious 
trading in runestones is illegal 
they are public property and this year we further tightened 
the laws but i believe many people break the law without knowing 
by picking up fragments lamm said 
runestones are still turning up in the latest find in september 
a mammoth stone uncovered in a churchyard on the baltic island of 
gotland recorded the westward travel of the vikings 
the elaborately carved inscription says vatar and hailgair 
erected the stone after helge their father he went westwards with 
the vikings 
the mushroomshaped 1500pound stone depicts a christian cross 
and mythological symbols which indicate that it was carved during 
the transition to christianity around 1000 years ago 
rune writers were swedens first artists to sign their works and 
the first national poets one stone says 
he stood like a man 
in the stem of the ship 
he lies in the west 
the oldest stones often depict carved scenes from mythology with 
ships in battle and norse gods in combat with dragons 
on a typical stone a caption is inscribed on the back of the 
giant mythical midgard snake whose body twists around the edge of 
the stones flattened surface legend says that judgment day will 
come when the god thor strikes the snake dead with his hammer 
helmer gustavson of the central board of national antiquities 
said runes also were carved on wood jewelry or weapons 
sometimes they only identified the owner tova owns me 
others invoked supernatural power on a spear or a knife 
experts disagree over the origin of the letters but ancient 
legends say the runic characters were a gift of the god odin the 
chief nordic deity 
runestones kept oral legends from disappearing and opened a world 
of ancient literature 
a ninthcentury stone called rokstenen is the most famous 
literary find on it a father tells of a son slain in battle he 
illustrates the story with heroic tales and songs 
carvings line the foreign routes of the long spring voyages when 
swift ships carried vikings over the known and unknown world 
viking graffiti decorate a marble lion that once guarded the 
greek port of piraeus and a church wall in constantinople now 
istanbul in turkey said gustavson of the antiquities board 
with christianity the voyages become scarcer and latin slowly 
overtook the runic alphabet 
runes are still taught in swedish schools 
gustavson said he once saw a modern variant on a rock by a 
stockholm lake a couple in the 1950s carved ulla and per tented

starkly different productions of music 
and dance by two lisbon theater groups provide intriguing glimpses 
into how the portuguese see themselves nearly 15 years after the 
return of democracy to western europes poorest nation 
the shows one by a progressive theater cooperative and the other 
by a more traditional music hall troupe also illustrate how the 
countrys recent history still weighs heavily on the public 
consciousness 
the 48year dictatorship established by antonio de salazar in 
1926 and brought down by leftist military officers in april 1974 is 
pivotal in both o baile the dance and a prova dos 
novos the test of the newcomers 
o baile performed at a former nightclub called the ritz by 
the a barraca the barracks cooperative was inspired by the french 
film le bal the dance directed by ettore scola 
helder costa director author and leader of the cooperative 
said the ritz production uses a dance hall setting to portray 
portugals memory of itself confronted by outside influences 
a prova dos novos takes place at the variedades theater in 
the downtown parque mayer where lisboetas have been going for years 
to eat grilled sardines and attend burlesque and vaudeville shows 
the writers and many of the actors are children of music hall 
veterans an art that has kept three theaters going in the park 
since the 1920s 
in o baile the decline of salazars dictatorship is 
portrayed as a carnival ball attended by dancers wearing huge paper 
mache masks representing the traditional pillars of society the 
roman catholic church the landowners the police and the secret 
service 
in a splashy number in the variedades show actor carlos cunha 
does a double takeoff on portugals leading young designer ana 
salazar and longtime ruler salazar as manna salazar the 
dictator of fashion who is obsessed by boots 
salazar who died in 1968 but whose regime carried over to 1974 
was popularly known as boots 
the 14 actors in o baile never utter a word although they go 
through numerous changes of costume designed to orient the audience 
to the time in which their performance takes place the second world 
war when neutral lisbon was the center of international intrigue 
the 30s when the fascist portuguese legion tried to bully civilians 
into submission the late 60s when thousands of portuguese youths 
were drafted into colonial african wars 
a beauty contest in the 50s judged by a fado singer dressed 
in black is a biting satire on the music identified with lisbon and 
made famous outside portugal by amalia rodrigues the songs often 
about lost love are accompanied by guitars or mandolins 
salazar turned fado into an official support for his regime 
costa said in an interview people forgot fado can also be 
lilting not only sad he almost succeeded in convincing the 
portuguese we were cut out to be morose melancholy and ultimately 
passive 
soccer portugals consuming national passion is also central in 
both productions 
in a prova dos novos contestants in a game show dressed to 
represent the four major soccer clubs benfica sporting os 
belenenses and porto offer a hilarious and biting look at how 
blatant gamefixing and cash deals have sullied the sport that keeps 
much of the population of 10 million mesmerized two nights a week 
in o baile dance hall patrons gather around to watch a 
flickering black and white image of mozambicanportuguese soccer 
great eusebio on the field in a scene marking the fateful 
introduction of television into the country in the late 50s 
with the exception of the music halls portuguese theater has 
never been terribly robust it suffers from a lack of funding and 
overwhelming competition from television 
but critic carlos porto calls the growing production of works 
about porutugal by portuguse writers one of the most important 
developments on our changing theatrical horizon 
although given generally favorable reviews a prova dos 
novos like the other music hall presentations in the parque 
mayer generally attracts a provincial audience 
most people who imagine themselves intellectuals or 
professionals wouldnt set foot in a musical revue in a place like 
this said gabriela alvarez a lisbon video producer too bad 
because theyre missing something 
the ritz doesnt advertise its show but costa said wordofmouth 
publicity and rave reviews for the yearold o baile have 
resulted in weekend capacity houses of 200 including president 
mario soares

daniel manion has a job he never sought after 
people said nasty things about him he never imagined hed hear 
manion was the focus of a battle over president reagans judicial 
appointments two years ago when he was named to the 7th us circuit 
court of appeals 
to his critics including prominent democrats and civil 
libertarians he was an untalented lawyer nominated only because of 
rightwing views 
republicans saw the former state legislator from south bend 
ind as an honorable public servant under fire only because 
liberals wanted to block reagan appointees 
it became a cause celebre for both sides manion 46 said of 
the fight for his ratification 
the people who knew me were defending me for the most 
part he said in a recent interview the people who knew me 
only by reputation ie my conservative politics were pretty 
much going after me 
the 7th circuit is based in chicago and covers illinois indiana 
and wisconsin 
in his 1986 confirmation hearings critics blasted manion for his 
politics and more pointing out grammatical errors in briefs from 
his private law practice in south bend they also questioned his 
intelligence 
manion said his briefs were written in a hurry and typed quickly 
by someone else noting that in a small practice your client 
cant afford to have three people edit something he said he 
did well in the cases 
questions about his intelligence also have failed to stick 
manion said 
if you were to take a crosssection of all the judges in the 
country youre going to see some really exceptional people he 
said then youre going to see a lot of people who are you know 
intelligent hardworking theyd be like me i guess 
manion shrugs off the criticisms as politics 
i held public office i was a state senator he said i 
understand politics i understand motivations 
but the ordeal was difficult for his family 
i think that as the toughest part he said in the opposite 
direction though many local people and state people even 
political adversaries said very nice things that they probably 
wouldnt have said if they didnt see this as being very negative i 
think that was gratifying 
some lawyers who have appeared before him in 7th circuit cases 
give him adequate to high marks for his courtroom demeanor 
it was clear he was on top of the case said samuel fifer a 
chicago lawyer who watched a junior associate argue a copyright 
infringement case before manion he has been behaving and 
performing like any other judge on that court 
but another chicago lawyer who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified criticized manion for taking more than a year to issue 
an opinion on a case 
hes just incredibly slow the lawyer said i think hes 
responding to all the criticism of his intellectual capacity and 
writing ability 
it was fair to call him slow at first manion said noting he was 
working in cramped temporary offices in south bend getting used to 
a new routine and breaking in new clerks now he said he is 
keeping pace with other judges 
at the 1986 confirmation hearings critics brought up manions 
father who was a founder of the ultraconservative john birch 
society in the 1970s he had appeared on talk shows with his 
father often questioning the authority of the supreme court on 
social issues 
though he acknowledges that he is conservative manion said 
precedent not ideology dictates his decisions in court 
you dont have any choice he said i thought that was 
clear from the start 
manions appointment came at a time when many democrats 
including sen paul simon of illinois were questioning 
qualifications of judges appointed by reagan 
the quality of the nominees that president reagan sent up under 
former attorney general ed meese was notably less than under the 
carter administration said pamela huey a simon spokeswoman 
the quality of nominees in the past year seems to have improved 
she said adding that the debate over manion may have made the 
justice department take more care in finding judges 
during the manion debate strong support came from fellow hoosier 
and law school acquaintance sen dan quayle now the running mate of 
republican presidential nominee george bush bush cast a 
tiebreaking vote for manion in the senate 
the american bar association rated manion qualified but the 
rating was mixed aba spokesman richard collins said the association 
does not followup formally once judges are seated 
forty lawschool deans also signed a letter opposing manions 
confirmation 
it was tough criticism for the softspoken indiana university law 
school graduate former deputy state attorney general oneterm 
state senator and the first vietnam veteran nominated to a federal 
appeals court 
but that is largely past 
a sampling of his written opinions does not reflect sharp biases 
in one opinion manion upheld a 32837 judgment against a 
stripmining company deemed delinquent in paying fees for land 
reclamation 
in another case manion overturned a lower court ruling in favor 
of a police department accused of using excessive force on a woman 
the opinions appear free of grammar and spelling errors which 
manion attributes to the resources of his office 
now i have two other people proofread everything he said 
manion who overcame a bout with multiple sclerosis that 
developed in 1979 won a local canoeing and running biathlon this 
summer has a new home in south bend and is a new father 
he takes a train the nearly 100 miles to chicago for courtroom 
work and meetings about once every 10 days he said he has no 
visions of moving up the supreme court 
in fact he said i wouldnt have taken this job if i had 
to move to chicago

when recession forecasts were blowing around like 
fall leaves in late october 1987 albert sindlinger said he was 
certain there wouldnt be one now he sees one coming 
again his view is at odds with the consensus which has the 
economy expanding weakly through most of the year with any 
recession occurring only at the very tail end or in 1990 
what makes sindlinger so sure of himself because he says you 
and other people all around the country tell him its 
microeconomics he explains we determine the economic 
condition of every household we call 
those calls total between 105 and 115 a day eight to 15 minutes 
each seven days a week from media pa its been that way for 34 
years with the calls to each state in proportion to its percent of 
the total population 
in effect says sindlinger i dont make the forecast the 
people do unlike consumer confidence polls sindlinger amp co 
personnel dont seek views on the national economy instead they 
seek data on household money supply 
that data is culled from answers to questions in four areas 
current income compared with six months earlier expected income 
over the next six months expected job security and expected local 
business conditions 
the answers provide the economic and market research firm with a 
measure of what it calls household liquidity when liquidity 
improves better times usually follow when it falls watch out 
since oct 10 says al sindlinger the liquidity fall has been 
very sharp 
a tour through the statistics with sindlinger shows why 
last week there were 88234 million telephone households 986 
percent of all households in the 48 contiguous states in these 
households were 151823 million household heads which means 
multiple heads in many homes 
sindlinger divides these households into three categories 
households that own stock in a public or private company or in a 
mutual fund intermediate households that dont own stocks but do 
own bonds and have savings and distressed households with no 
savings or other liquid assets 
the stockholder households accounted for 24 percent of the total 
households the intermediates made up 574 percent the distressed 
households 186 percent 
during the past year or ever since the big market crash of oct 
19 1987 the intermediate category was the sturdy underpinning of 
the american economy says sindlinger they were liquid enough to go 
on buying 
now theres a big question regarding that ability heres why 
on aug 8 the day before the federal reserve raised the discount 
rate to fight inflation that wasnt there says sindlinger 
69 percent of all heads of households had household liquidity 
that is they were able to show gains in income over the prior 
six months and expected that situation to continue during the next 
six months 
but in the week of oct 27 sindlinger was able to find only 562 
percent with liquidity the loss he said resulted from adjustable 
rate loans whose costs have risen true he said these households 
have assets that now might earn higher interest but these assets 
are small in comparison to a mortgage 
among stockholder families only 3 percent currently have any 
plans to buy more stock and seven of 10 current stockholders expect 
the value of what they have to fall during the next six months 
meanwhile the intermediate group made up of those with savings 
bonds and other liquid assets has swelled this is the group 
sindlinger points out that was liquid enough to keep the country 
out of recession since last year 
but while the intermediate category has grown absorbing some 
exstockholders its liquidity has fallen a year ago many of 
those in the intermediate category were flush having sold out of 
the stock market at the top those falling down into the 
intermediate category now are considerably less well off many are 
illiquid 
what then keeps stocks up foreign buying mainly japanese 
says the octogenarian sindlinger it certainly isnt the american 
public he snaps 
instead the american public seems to be preparing for a 
recession thanks to the fed says sindlinger americans are 
increasingly illiquid thats what they tell me he says

alan garcia perus youthful president was 
viewed as latin americas brightest political star after taking 
office three years ago but today his nation is mired in its worst 
economic crisis of the century 
garcias reputation is in tatters and the countrys fragile 
democracy appears increasingly vulnerable to a military coup 
since garcia imposed the harshest austerity program in perus 
history in early september some critics have gone so far as to 
demand his resignation and he reportedly has considered stepping 
down more ominously many public figures are warning of the growing 
danger of a military takeover 
cesar hilderbrandt editor of the independent news magazine si 
wrote in a recently published open letter to garcia you know 
just as other officials of your government do that a coup detat is 
inevitable if the political and economic climate of today continues 
to devastate the country 
perus armed forces seized power in 1968 and ruled until 1980 
they returned to the barracks under heavy public accusations that 
their leftist policies brought on economic mismanagement 
the 39yearold garcias approval rating among perus 21 million 
people has plunged from an incredible 96 percent during his first 
months in office to 16 percent in late october according to the 
respected polling firm apoyo 
when he took over the 6foot3 garcia leader of the populist 
aprista party was called the president of hope by his 
followers most of them impoverished mountain peasants or 
inhabitants of limas sprawling shantytowns 
nowadays he is accused of being a demagogue of implementing 
impetuous irresponsible policies that have brought economic ruin to 
the nation and of failing to curtail the shining path movement 
whose eightyear guerrilla war has claimed more than 12000 lives 
mario vargas llosa the renowned novelist who is expected to be 
the presidential candidate of a centerright coalition in the 1990 
election recently described garcia as the charismatic young man 
responsible for perus most incompetent and ruinous government of 
the century 
what has peruvians most upset is the countrys unprecedented 
runaway inflation provoked economists agree by the governments 
uncontrolled spending which has spawned a huge fiscal deficit 
equivalent to 16 percent of the gross domestic product 
consumer prices soared by 114 percent in september as much in 
one month as all of last year inflation is expected to exceed 1000 
percent by year end 
having eaten up the countrys hard currency reserves to finance a 
consumerhinged economic recovery program and having cut itself off 
from fresh foreign loans the government is close to bankruptcy it 
has had to resort to selling the central banks gold bullion to pay 
import bills but now that is gone 
finance minister abel salinas said recently the economy would 
shrink by at least 6 percent this year after growing 85 percent in 
1986 and 70 percent in 1987 
the harsh austerity measures which included increases in food 
prices of more than 200 percent and a devaluation of nearly 90 
percent brought economic activity to a halt 
only four new cars were sold in the country in september because 
of tax increases that doubled car prices with the least expensive 
volkswagen model now costing 26000 beer sales were down 90 
percent from august 
from early september until mid october garcia did not leave the 
inner confines of the government palace for 34 straight days except 
on one occasion to watch the changing of the guards from the front 
entrance that single fleeting appearance was interpreted by 
commentators as a gesture to dispel rumors he was no longer in 
charge of the government 
garcia was reported to have tried to present his resignation to 
his cabinet before the unpopular austerity package was imposed and 
to have offered the job to luis alberto sanchez his 88yearold 
blind vice president sanchez said later that he told garcia i 
was elected vice president to collaborate with you not to take your 
place 
political analysts say garcias recent behavior has given the 
impression of a dangerous power vacuum that feeds the fears of a 
military takeover 
even the least informed citizen knows or senses that there 
cannot be a power vacuum in politics he also knows that in peru 
power vacuums are always filled by the military manuel 
dornellas editor of the opposition newspaper expreso wrote in a 
recent column 
a senior government official told the associated press that the 
military high command did in fact meet to consider overthrowing 
garcia during his selfimposed confinement to the palace 
the president was passing through a period of depression that 
worried the military the official said speaking on condition he 
not be identified 
having suffered in the past under long spells of military rule 
perus political leaders have been outspoken in demanding that the 
armed forces not be provoked into seizing power again 
nothing would be more tragic for peru than a military coup 
writer vargas llosa said perus isolation from the international 
community would be aggravated even further

the taylor highway a ribjarring gravel 
washboard that snakes through mining hills northeast of this 
interior alaska village doesnt rate much mention in the tourist 
brochures 
but the taylor is larry champagnes specialty he drives a tow 
truck and as they say in the trade business is picking up he sat 
the other day in his chevron station and pointed out the highways 
latest victim a van with a crushed roof and shattered windows 
he was passing a motor home on a curve got over too far and 
thppt into the river he said champagne was happy to haul 
the van and its uninjured driver back to tok for 700 
a 1984 legislative study found that 60 percent of alaska highways 
were in fair to poor condition but the potholes and frost heaves 
dont slow the flow of vacationers growing herds of tourists not 
only keep champagne smiling but also help fuel debate over this 
frontier states transportation future 
more roads say business leaders who see a young and developing 
state with little access to remote villages and mineral deposits 
stop the bulldozers cry environmentalists who see a pristine 
land needing protection from the forces that paved over the lower 48 
states 
the arguments likely will continue as long as there are places 
people cannot drive to and much of alaska fits that category the 
states 11600 miles of roads are concentrated in the southeastern 
quarter leaving vast areas untracked 
onefourth of alaskas halfmillion residents live unconnected by 
road to the outside world of 151 incorporated communities 133 are 
unconnected including the state capital of juneau 
given the mountains and permanently frozen ground that cover much 
of alaska its a wonder roads were ever built 
turnofthecentury gold rushes spurred the first major 
construction in world war ii concerns about a japanese invasion 
prompted another building frenzy the 1520mile alaska highway 
alaskas first overland link to the lower 48 was finished in just 
nine months 
since statehood in 1959 expansion has continued steadily the 
latest road completed this summer in northwestern alaska is a 
54mile link from the coast to a mineral deposit known as red dog 
i try not to think about that said susan alexander state 
representative for the wilderness society which unsuccessfully 
fought the roads route through cape krusenstern national monument 
she said wilderness is easily destroyed by roads and resulting 
development and pollution she cited the 416mile dalton highway 
built in 1974 to link fairbanks and the prudhoe bay oil fields 
although only the highways southern half is open to the public lax 
enforcement lets many drivers slip through to the north and 
alexander worries about the effect on wildlife 
increased access means increased poaching and there definitely 
has been poaching along the road the road lets in people hunters 
who wouldnt have been there otherwise she said 
letting more people into alaska is what economic boosters have 
had in mind for years wherever roads have gone tourism has 
followed us customs officials say 38150 vehicles about 70 
percent of them motor homes and campers entered the state on the 
alaska highway last year 
roads can cut shipping costs to villages and make remote mining 
more competitive say the boosters who over the years have proposed 
dozens of roads to fill blank spaces on the map 
in 1977 travel guides called the 152mile elliott highway near 
fairbanks the road to nome even though it deadended and still 
does 500 miles short of the bering sea town 
in 1986 the greater fairbanks chamber of commerce suggested a 
road that would head 200 miles southwest from denali national park 
to mcgrath then swing north another 200 miles to the yukon river 
in southeastern alaska plans surface occasionally to connect 
juneau to highways that now stop in haines and skagway 
but such projects each estimated to cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars are distant dreams for state officials who can barely raise 
the 52 million needed each year to maintain existing roads 
alaskas oildependent government has grown cautious since the 
oil boom busted and the state department of transportation plans no 
major highway expansion it would cost 600 million just to bring 
alaskas rural highways up to standards said ron lind the agencys 
planning and budget director 
patterns of land use and ownership also discourage roadbuilding 
national parks preserves and monuments now cover 50 million of 
alaskas 375 million acres natives protective of open space needed 
for subsistence hunting and fishing own 44 million acres 
but things could change quickly in alaskas boombust economy as 
publisher robert henning wrote in an alaska geographic book called 
adventure roads north 
strong antiroads sentiments of environmentalist groups have 
slowed alaskan road construction but in the history of the north 
there has ever been the cry for more roads more trails and it is 
inevitable that the road building will continue like it or not 
it seems to be the american way 
wherever and whenever roads are built the likes of larry 
champagne will be there to pick up the pieces back at the chevron 
station champagne was smiling again a winnebago driver was in for 
the second time that day with a flat tire 
champagne quickly fixed the tire and proceeded to the cash 
register thatll be 10 he said you have a nice day

a scientist in a white lab coat scraped bits of 
cancer tissue from a white mouse into two sterilized glass dishes 
two young men in slightly scruffy street clothes sat on stools in 
front of the dishes each extended his right hand over a dish 
closed his eyes and concentrated 
they are giving off qi whispered the scientist immunologist 
gu ligang 
the experiment a hybrintific method and seeming 
magic is part of a growing effort among chinese scied of modern scientists 
to 
verify and analyze what many chinese believe to be a special human 
energy called qi 
the belief in qi is central to traditional chinese medicine but 
it is viewed skeptically by western scientists 
in this case the two men giving off qi were attempting to kill 
the cancerous cells in the dishes 
popular interest in qi and 2000yearold exercises to develop 
it called qigong is sweeping china after the method had been 
suppressed for decades as superstition an estimated 50 million 
adults practice qigong exercises while hospitals schools and 
scholarly institutes across china are researching qi 
qigong is a national cultural treasure and an integral part of 
chinese traditional medicinesble channels like veins and that illness 
is a result 
of blockages in its flow traditional healing techniques from 
herbal medicines to acupuncture to qigong are efforts to restore 
the distribution of qi 
gu ligangs experiment with the cancerous cells like hundreds 
being done nationwide seeks to gather physical evidence of whether 
some people known as qigong masters can project their qi like a 
beam of energy to manipulate matter and cure illness 
gu one of 30 qigong researchers at the beijing college of 
traditional chinese medicine said some cancerous cells were killed 
in one sample in his experiment but not enough to prove anything 
qigong masters however say their work proves the mysterious 
force exists 
hu yulan 59 said she has cured serious heart and neurological 
illnesses by directing her qi at patients 
another master wan sujian said a 49yearold peasant woman came 
to him after a surgeon told her a large tumor in her brain was 
inoperable and that she would die in two months 
wan said the woman could barely walk because of the tumors 
pressure on portions of the brain that control movement 
but after 10 treatments he said the woman was walking freely 
the tumor has shrunk wan claimed he predicted complete 
recovery 
thousands of other qigong masters who operate clinics without 
licensing or regulation make similar claims some say they can heal 
bone fractures and diagnose ailments with xray vision even when 
the patient is absent volumes of anecdotes of seemingly miraculous 
cures have been published 
there are many blank areas in science said liu yaning a 
biophysicist at the air forces xidiaoyutai hospital in beijing 
in china many scientists believe the qigong masters will lead a 
revolution in science 
but western medicine which in the past decade has found chemical 
explanations for acupunctures ability to deaden pain balks at the 
concept of qi 
i havent been convinced by any experiment that this energy 
exists or that it can be controlled said dr david eisenberg an 
instructor at the harvard medical school who attended the qigong 
conference 
however eisenberg who studied traditional medicine in china in 
1979 and 1980 and wrote a book about qigong said he has seen 
startling demonstrations of qigong masters skills and cannot simply 
dismiss them as fakes 
there are phenomenon in every culture that suggests there may 
be the ability of humans to sense andor manipulate their own 
biological fields for lack of a better word he said im 
troubled but not convinced 
chinese scientists also are troubled many who are testing qigong 
masters said they believe some form of special human energy exists 
but cant define it 
books on qigong describe it variously as akin to radar infrared 
light magnetism subsonic sound waves or all of those 
i think qi is a big bag liu said there are a lot of 
things in it not just one kind of energy or matter 
he added that his experiments showing that natural luminescence 
given off by qigong masters bodies is higher than that given off by 
other people have convinced him qi exists 
there is much clinical evidence to see the effect of qigong on 
many different diseases said dr lu yongcai a pathologist at the 
beijing college of traditional medicines qigong institute we 
want to know the mechanisms that qi is present is no problem 
qi definitely can cause biological reactions thats a fact 
said zhou yang the institutes chief immunologist 
he said his experiments have shown that qi can promote the 
proliferation of diseasefighting tcells in laboratory mice and 
stimulate the development of the thymus an important gland in the 
immune system 
chinese scientists at the qigong conference said their work 
showed qigong masters can do such things as kill or inhibit leukemia 
cells in mice promote healing of strained muscles and broken bones 
in rabbits and sharpen intelligence 
eisenberg contended that most of the studies suffered from poor 
design or lacked control groups and other standard precautions 
against bias 
there is at least as much likelihood that this is a cultural 
societal wish fulfillment he said qi is part of the culture 
they are wed to it they want to prove it 
but dr gabriel stux who runs an acupuncture clinic in 
duesseldorf in west germany noted that western medicine also relies 
on techniques not fully understood 
many drugs you dont know how they work but you do a lot of 
pragmatic things he said

venezuelans whose fortunes rise and 
fall with the price of oil are heading into a presidential election 
next month at a time when their oncerobust economy is in a serious 
slump 
the seventhmonth campaign for the dec 4 balloting has been rich 
in promises by candidates who have yet to explain how they would pay 
for their programs if elected 
more than 9 million people roughly half the population of the 
country are eligible to vote to elect their seventh president since 
the nations last dictator gen marcos perez jimenez was 
overthrown in 1958 
the main candidates are former president carlos andres perez 66 
of the social democratic accion democratica ad party and eduardo 
fernandez 48 of the social christian party better known as copei 
the acronym formed by its name in spanish 
recent polls give a lead of 14 points to perez who served as 
president in 197378 when venezuela was awash in oil dollars 
both candidates have made campaign promises ranging from 
modernizing the nations industries and placing computers in every 
school to new hospital beds and free milk for school children 
neither has detailed where they will get money to pay for it all 
but with the nations onceoverflowing treasury now nearly empty 
whoever wins is likely to find it difficult to fulfill campaign 
pledges 
despite a relative success in agriculture venezuelas economy 
has been hardhit by persistently low prices of oil the nations 
major source of export revenue oil has plunged from a high of 30 a 
barrel in the 1970s to its current level of around 13 
current prices on world markets continue to slump a sharp 
contrast to the market boom during perez first term when he 
nationalized the oil industry the slide in oil prices this year 
alone may cost the nation as much as 3 billion in revenue nearly a 
third of the 107 billion originally expected 
coupled with a foreign debt of 35 billion latin americas 
fourth largest after brazil mexico and argentina a continuation of 
this trend may pose a heavy political and social burden to the 
government to be installed in february 
according to official statistics real income for the average 
venezuelan family has shrunk by 20 percent since 1982 when oil 
prices began to fall 
while less than 15 percent of the population enjoys 35 percent 
of the nations income 40 percent do not earn enough to cover their 
basic nutritional needs according to a venezuelan central 
university report 
perez and fernandez agree that drastic changes must be 
implemented to reverse this trend but while perez proposes to 
expand public sector expenditures as a means to boost the economy 
fernandez says he would rely more on the private sector 
rather than emphasizing their differences both perez and 
fenandez have devoted most of their efforts trying to discredit each 
other 
intense hostility kicked off the early part of the campaign when 
both candidates accused each other of receiving campaign money from 
drug traffickers 
the exchange of accusations ceased only when the supreme 
electoral council which supervises the campaign called on perez 
and fernandez to avoid injurious attacks 
ad and copei have traditionally alternated in power with ad 
winning over copei four out of six times in the 30 years of civilian 
rule 
both parties together totalled 90 percent of the vote in the 1983 
elections won by the ads jaime lusinchi now the incumbent 
president 
twentyone other candidates also are in the running covering a 
wide range of the political and social spectrum 
one is a witch doctor romulo abreu duarte who professes a 
fervent belief in the legendary goddess maria lionza descended her 
devotees say from a spanish conquistador and an indian princess 
others include the former procastro guerrilla leader teodoro 
petkoff of the leftist movement toward socialism and ismenia 
villalba of the centrist democratic revolutionary union 
aware of the overwhelming strength of ad and copei the minor 
parties are aiming instead to win some of the 229 congressional 
seats at stake 
both villalba the first woman to ever run for president in 
venezuela and petkoff expect to improve their parties 
congressional strength now respectively 11 and 9 seats 
the tiny venezuelan communist party is running in a coalition led 
by edmundo chirinos former rector of venezuelan central university 
ad and copei stand to lose considerable legislative power if the 
minor parties make gains in the congressional balloting analysts 
say

has the stock market that legendary cauldron of 
excess and greed suddenly been transformed into a force for 
discipline and restraint in the us economy 
what brings up this question is the recent outbreak of reluctance 
among the investing public to endorse and join in the buyout wave 
sweeping through many areas of corporate america 
the merits and demerits of takeovers and leveraged buyouts or 
lbos can be debated endlessly as new deals of unprecedented size 
have surfaced in the past few weeks however more and more analysts 
warned that a longstanding trend was turning into a dangerous mania 
at some point even some early proponents of lbos declared the 
load of debt created to replace the stock taken out of public hands 
in these deals threatens to turn into an onerous burden 
the situation seemed to come to a head on thursday when buyout 
fever gave way to what looked more like buyout phobia in the 
stock market 
investors including money managers at some large institutions 
began selling instead of buying stocks that were known or rumored to 
be candidates for takeovers buyouts or restructurings 
the fear did not originate in the stock market owners of 
corporate bonds had been selling for several days restive about the 
prospect of large new increases in business debt 
nevertheless the change of attitude was striking for the 
first time people are seeing how the whole process works said 
hugh johnson at first albany corp in albany ny 
the typical takeover deal johnson observed requires a 
financing it requires a successful financing and sometimes a 
successful financing is hard to do 
should they continue to vote with their pocketbooks against 
takeovers investors could cause a good deal of trouble for the 
securities business 
less takeover activity might well mean decreased trading volume 
reduced revenues for already depressed investment firms and lower 
stock prices for all concerned at least in the short run 
but at the same time some observers argue antitakeover 
sentiment in the market might help defuse a potentially explosive 
problem 
as anthony tabell at delafield harvey tabell inc put it 
the current market driven as it is by takeovers raises at least 
a few echoes of the banking practices of the 1920s 
looking at one proposed deal predicated on about 10 billion of 
borrowed money tabell said it is hard to see this practice as 
anything other than the extension of stock market credit a process 
which when indulged in excessively in the past has been known to 
lead to grief 
the concept of securities markets acting as a kind of 
vigilante force to police the economy has been gaining increased 
currency in recent years 
first it was the bond market burned by inflation in the 1970s 
and early 1980s bond traders became militant antiinflationists 
pushing interest rates higher each time they saw the slightest 
stirring of an increase in inflationary pressures 
in some peoples eyes the stock market crash of 1987 was a 
vigilante action too a move to forestall international trade and 
credit policies that investors collectively saw as frightening 
in fact those who subscribe to this view say the crash probably 
prevented a recession by forcing changes in policies and attitudes 
rather than foreshadowing or causing an economic slump 
economic growth continues with relatively low inflation whether 
you like the idea of financial vigilantes operating in the markets 
or not they appear to be pretty good at getting things their way

thousands of bones are heaped on the 
tables skulls of all sizes stare from the shelves soon thigh bones 
will be connected to hip bones and neck bones to head bones at the 
ht lensgraf co 
we can make your motherinlaw if you want said tom 
shelledy general manager of lensgraf one of the few companies in 
the world that creates handmade replicas of entire skeletons and 
individual bones 
the finished products made of urethane plastic are sold to 
clinics medical schools physical therapists hospitals medical 
libraries and doctors nationwide and in 20 other countries 
you mention lensgraf products and just about any doctor knows 
who youre talking about shelledy said 
having one of the worlds leading makers of bone copies in this 
southeastern iowa village doesnt seem strange to the 897 residents 
many of them dont even blink when shelledy takes his pet baboon 
babelle for a stroll 
from a cage in the middle of the lensgraf factory babelle 
watches two dozen employees work in somewhat of an assembly line 
fashion 
parts a total of 180 not including small hardware such as 
screws and wire for assembly are formed in molds that were made 
from actual bones 
most of the bones have come out of india or europe shelledy 
said a real complete skeleton will run you a couple of thousand 
dollars 
after the plastic parts harden they are taken to another part of 
the factory where the excess bits called flesh are removed 
the urethane plastic skeletons each selling for 399 are 
assembled at five separate stations 
it takes a day to make a full skeletal replica shelledy 
said we can put out 14 a day 
the replicas are complete with arteries discs and nerves and 
lensgraf also manufactures dog heart replicas for veterinarians 
for fun lensgraf makes such trinkets as 5inchlong spinal cord 
key chains or key rings attached to miniature foot and hand 
structures 
shelledy says its not spooky being around bones and skulls all 
day 
i wouldnt say its spooky its quite different he said 
your mind comes up with a lot of questions who they were what 
they were like to know these structures once had feelings 
happy and sad and now theyre all gone

in his search for an escape from the frustration of 
playing monarchinwaiting prince charles is carving out a niche as 
an improbable but often effective voice of the people 
his sorties into issues like ocean pollution unemployment and 
inner city decay bring him about as close to political controversy 
as the strictly neutral british monarchy can go by stretching the 
bars of his gilded cage this child of privilege faces the irony of 
becoming a darling of the left monarchys traditional foe 
charles philip arthur george turns 40 on nov 14 and the bonnie 
prince charlie of younger days has grown more somber the sense of 
guilt at all his privileges more apparent 
theres still a lot of the funloving jetsetter left in him but 
the solemn face looks more lined and livedin the pate that will 
one day wear the crown is balding his taste in clothes runs to 
conservative doublebreasted suits if he owns a pair of jeans no 
one in the outside world has seen him in them 
moving among his fellow citizens particularly the young urban 
unemployed who are his biggest concern he takes on what a 
biographer alan hamilton calls the faintly puzzled air of a 
bishop in a betting shop 
at times the heir to the throne could pass for just another 
1960s survivor coasting into middle age married with two small 
kids hes into organic farming alternative medicine health food 
jungian philosophy and the fate of ozone layer 
what lifts him above the ordinary is that as prince of wales 
earl of chester duke of cornwall duke of rothesay earl of 
carrick baron of renfrew lord of the isles and great steward of 
scotland his destiny is to become king charles iii 
that destiny looks far off his mother queen elizabeth ii is 
healthy and vigorous at 62 and shows no inclination to abdicate in 
favor of her son 
meanwhile perhaps mindful of an earlier prince of wales who 
frittered away 59 years waiting to be crowned king edward vii the 
prince has made it clear that i am determined not to be confined 
to cutting ribbons 
charles story writes another biographer anthony holden is 
one of constant struggle against the limitations placed upon him by 
the genetic accident of his birth a confused and tortured soul 
trying to come to terms with a claustrophobic if comfortable life 
of inherited imprisonment a caring and thoughtful man in search 
of good to do 
that search has taken him on clandestine visits to london slums 
into the cowsheds of his tenant farmers to the peatlands of the 
western isles of scotland and as far afield as the kalahari desert 
in southern africas botswana 
his attempts to articulate what he has learned have suffered from 
clumsiness but as his themes become more polished they tell as 
much about his own state of mind as they do about the state of 
britain 
simply put charles stands for consensus in a society divided by 
the uncompromising anticonsensus politics of margaret thatcher 
where the conservative prime minister is embarked on a capitalist 
revolution designed to create what she calls a gogetter 
society charles gives voice to the fears of the losers in this 
race for a leaner tougher britain 
the problem for charles is that when the issues are so 
allembracing and consensus is a dirty word in mrs thatchers 
book just being neutral can seem like taking sides 
were in for a period of eight 10 perhaps 20 years of 
conservative government and therefore any criticism of the world as 
it is sounds like a criticism of the government says norman 
tebbit a former conservative party chairman 
thus when charles attacks north sea pollution it is widely seen 
as an attack on mrs thatchers government as insensitive to the 
environment 
when he decries unemployment thatcherites bristle at a perceived 
criticism of the prime minister for having caused the unemployment 
if charles laments poverty the implication intended or not is 
that mrs thatcher doesnt care about the poor 
says biographer hamilton mrs thatcher believes in the 
meritocracy and an individual in mrs thatchers britain is all 
right provided he can make it on his own mrs thatcher does not 
sympathize with the underprivileged charles does

tom nairn an antimonarchist writer says the irony is that if 
there is any threat to the monarchy today it comes not from the 
left but from tory rightwingers traditional upholders of the royal 
institution who are irked by charles posture as conscience of the 
nation 
nairn said in an interview that often when he addresses 
leftwing groups ive had people say to me you mustnt 
criticize charles too much because hes on our side 
a devotee of the smallisbeautiful ethos charles believes in 
good works on a small individual scale and runs two charitable 
trusts that dispense grants of up to 3000 pounds 5000 to 
unemployed people 18 to 25 years old to start a small business 
about 1800 people a year get grants and the trusts have created 
some 4300 businesses one of them a birmingham bakery is making 
the cake for his birthday party which will be celebrated with a 
street festival in the central england city 
blessed with a private 39million fortune charles is the first 
royal heir to forego his annual entitlement from taxpayers funds 
also although he doesnt have to pay income tax he gives the 
state onequarter of the annual 34million profit from his 
130000acre farming estate the duchy of cornwall 
i cannot just sit there and do nothing he told a bbc radio 
interviewer a year ago thats the way ive been brought up i am 
driven by the feeling i have had for a long time by traveling 
around this country and using my eyes that i mind about the 
conditions in which people live 
last year he made a secret trip by van around a destitute 
district of londons east end 
another time after visiting immigrant workers from indias 
bengal in a garment sweatshop he looked shaken and angry 
this is really terrible he exclaimed all we are managing 
to do is replicate some of the conditions these people have left 
behind it is really not acceptable we must do something 
although he insists on being bowed to and addressed as a royal 
highness he sometimes portrays himself in speeches as just another 
ordinary citizen fedup with bureaucrats and conventional wisdoms 
attacking modern architects on grounds that they put people in 
what he described as termite colonies he said large numbers of 
us in this country are fed up with being talked down to and dictated 
to 
a bland ceremony opening a movie museum becomes a diatribe 
against the palpable nonsense of experts who say screen violence 
does no harm 
charles defines his role as being to stir things up to throw a 
proverbial royal brick through the plate glass of pompous and 
professional pride 
what aggravates him most is a sense that his serious endeavors 
are eclipsed by the medias obsession with royal trivia and the 
state of his sevenyearold marriage to princess diana 
they are 12 years apart and their frequent separations have led 
to frantic newspaper speculation about a possible divorce a notion 
ridiculed by most royal insiders 
the couple make no secret of the fact that they live partly 
separate lives and have widely different interests she likes 
fashion and pop music he enjoys gardening solitary walks and 
painting in watercolors 
as hamilton points out separate lives are not unusual among 
british upperclass couples for whom a primary purpose of marriage 
is to produce an heir and a spare 
charles and diana have discharged that duty by having two sons

charles haids longtime hobby of doing accents 
came in handy when he was cast as an australian soldier in the nbc 
miniseries the great escape ii the untold story 
he plays sgt mac mackenzie in the fourhour twopart series 
that is a sequel to the blockbuster 1963 movie about the true story 
of a huge escape of allied airmen from a german prisonerofwar camp 
in world war ii 
hes a combination of a couple of guys said haid mostly a 
scot whos still alive but was conveniently changed to an aussie 
for television my character was a tunnel digger moles they called 
them 
we filmed in yugoslavia with a lot of british actors my 
biggest challenge was fitting in with their dialects my hobby is 
doing accents ive been fascinated by accents since i was a kid i 
have a kind of parrot ear mostly what i did was listen to tapes 
then all of a sudden slipping into an australian accent youre 
talkin like that 
the great escape sequel will be broadcast by nbc on sunday 
and monday nov 67 
besides haid who starred as officer andy renko for seven years 
on hill street blues the movie also features christopher reeve 
judd hirsch anthony denison michael nader and donald pleasence 
pleasence who was an actual pow in world war ii played an allied 
prisoner in the 1963 movie which starred steve mcqueen james 
garner charles bronson and richard attenborough in the miniseries 
pleasence plays a german ss officer 
the miniseries picks up the story of the escape and its bloody 
aftermath in which 50 recaptured prisoners were murdered the 
second half takes on aspects of a police chase as some of the 
escaped pows return to germany after the war to track down those 
responsible for the killings 
we were in zagreb yugoslavia which is in the middle of 
nowhere haid said of filming wed get in a car every morning 
and drive out into the woods the pow camp was built in the woods 
wed pass woodsmen with their horses and wagons and axes it was 
like something from another century 
its a beautiful country so much of its untouched i liked 
it but a lot of people didnt the roads are pretty bad but you 
could turn a corner and step back into another century 
haid said he plays the lovable old cuss in the miniseries you 
see them in every english war movie he said im the guy who 
says its awright mate youll make it its like a victor 
mclaglen part 
haid was is the navy in the early 1960s and served aboard a 
nuclear submarine after that he got a degree in directing from 
carnegie institute of technology in 1968 he began his career as an 
associate producer of the musical hit godspell and since then 
has swung back and forth between acting and producing 
the first feature film he produced was square dance followed 
by flying blind which hasnt been released yet future projects 
are ask the dust about los angeles in the 1930s and the 
nightman a thriller he and actress melanie mayron have written a 
comedy about mistaken identity 
he also has a role in home room news currently being filmed 
in indiana its great to be in a picture thats not about life 
and death he said before starting i play a doctor whose 
daughter wants to be a journalist and he wants her to go to medical 
school 
im just a character actor im finding its wonderful and 
freeing to be away from hill street blues its good to get away 
from a character as strong as renko i was in danger of being 
typecast its also nice to be working i havent hit the wall so 
many actors do after a series thats because of hill street it 
was such a special show it rubbed off on all the actors it was a 
turning point for television 
haid did a pilot after hill street blues called fort 
figueroa that was not picked up as a series 
im hopefully headed toward directing he said ive been 
attending the university of bochco meaning ive been observing on 
the set of la law steven bochco is the executive producer of 
la law and before that hill street blues 
if i direct something i want to know how to do it first he 
said i need the technical knowledge i embarrass easily i dont 
want to try to direct and do something that will make me cringe i 
think people measure you by what youre attached to

rita moreno didnt have to search for a role 
model to play a movie star fighting desperately to save her sagging 
career 
shes a joan crawford kind of character said moreno who 
stars in the final episode of tales from the hollywood hills on 
nov 18 on pbs the writer of the story knew her its a marvelous 
role very showy 
the closed set is based on a short story by gavin lambert 
moreno had a reallife encounter with crawford that could have been 
a scene from this scathing view of hollywood or from mommie 
dearest christina crawfords tellall book about her famous 
mother 
the encounter took place backstage at the academy awards in 1961 
when moreno won as best supporting actress for west side story 
i flew in from manila where i was making a b picture on the 
offchance that i would win over judy garland in judgment in 
nuremberg she said joan crawford i think was one of the 
cohosts she had a dressing room right off the stage with a huge 
pepsi cola cooler 
i won the oscar and i ran off stage and burst into tears joan 
crawford grabbed me and clutched me to her football fieldsized 
bosom the photographers started taking pictures she wouldnt let 
go and she wouldnt let my face show she kept posing for the 
photographers i couldnt breathe and the oscar was digging into me 
some big guy finally pried us apart 
that wasnt the end 
a week later moreno said i was back in manila when i got 
a letter on the famous blue stationery she said darling rita how 
sweet and thoughtful of you to come and visit me in my dressing room 
at the moment of your glory love joan 
moreno rocked with laughter visit her dressing room she 
said she had a death grip on me and dragged me in 
while being interviewed moreno wore a purple dress that hugged 
her svelte figure on her dark curly hair is a deep purple hat with 
a rolled brim she said fans often ask her how she keeps so thin 
she tells them diet regular workouts and a strenuous concert act 
in the closed set she portrays actress julie forbes who 
hires a hot new director of a justreleased art film for a quick fix 
to her skidding career 
shes doing a movie more or less based on her life about her 
start as a burlesque queen said moreno hes in the elia kazan 
mold shes old hollywood he thinks he can finally get her to act 
but she gets scared to her an art film is harsh lighting and 
wrinkles on her face 
she sets out to sabotage his film and make it show she bars 
him from the set and completes the movie her way the ending is very 
much in the hollywood tradition she doesnt fall on her face and 
the director becomes famous for a film he doesnt want his name on 
the onehour film is the last of six under the heading tales 
from the hollywood hills for great performances on pbs 
previous episodes have been based on stories written by john ohara 
budd schulberg f scott fitzgerald pg wodehouse and william 
faulkner 
watch this film and youll see why moreno won that oscar as well 
as a tony two emmys and a grammy she is marvelous as the actress 
dripping honey one moment hurling abuse the next it also stars 
dw moffett as the young director and harold gould as the studio 
boss mollie miller directed from a screenplay by ellen m violett 
we turned out a fourweek movie in 14 days said moreno we 
had wonderful people thats why people work for pbs for almost 
nothing you get the best you can get women our producer director 
and writer were all women i think people do this because its a 
talent showcase 
the networks would never let cinematographer fred elmes light 
this the way he did he used a lot of scrims on the lights and a lot 
of pink which gave very subtle fleshy tones the networks wouldnt 
let you do this kind of story pbs is a national treasure and we 
have to look after it

editors note the candidates revels now are ended for many 
that came not a moment too soon the campaign as polls have shown 
was widely decried as negative and uninformative short on charisma 
long on insults in this lively review a reporter who has observed 
presidential politics over four decades distills the essence of what 
handlers and principals wrought

in the first presidential election in american 
history in 1789 there were no primaries no nominating 
conventions no campaign no debates no speeches 
envious 
though heavy with hot air of zealots and rascals most of the 
elections since then also offered american voters some fun and 
entertainment in the torchlight parades the bands and songs the 
wit and spark of combat 
had any fun lately 
as campaigns go this one more than most seemed mirthless and 
endless a battle of consultants and computers of goofs and gaffes 
a pingpong match with square balls 
a campaign in which the smokefilled room was replaced by a room 
full of machines and charisma was outlawed instinct surrendered to 
statistics and spontaneity was scripted a campaign nasty without 
passion an argument without compelling differences a game of 
trivia for high stakes 
george bush the new john wayne spent more time on the flag than 
betsy ross michael dukakis said one observer came across like a 
man making a condolence call dan quayle the metaphors were 
nonstop try reluctant rambo 
the rhetoric was a notch above james garfields in 1880 a 
pound of pluck is worth a ton of luck the campaigning was less 
sharp than the republican line of 1948 to err is truman and 
less original than theodore roosevelts phrase for woodrow wilson in 
1916 a byzantine logothete functionary 
the debates of 1988 fell short of lincolndouglas some viewers 
found themselves yearning for the carterford debate of 1976 when 
the sound went off and the two candidates for president of the 
united states of america stared at each other and said absolutely 
nothing for 27 delicious minutes you could look it up 
still this year had its special moments none likely to be 
treasured by the principals with all the whatif questions put to 
quayle george bush his sponsor could not have enjoyed the many 
reminders that if elected he might die in office lose his mind or 
be forced out in disgrace 
michael dukakis could not have cherished that picture of him 
riding in an army tank and wearing it seemed his fathers helmet 
objective observers agreed he probably could not project a warrior 
image even with two pearlhandled revolvers on his hips and a knife 
in his teeth 
it was a campaign of awkward challenges and doltish questions 
from the media prove youre not a wimp show me youre not an 
iceberg convince me youre not a pea brain what would be the first 
thing youd do if suddenly you were president well what go to 
war count the silver and then as if this were the key question 
that would unravel the witness if your wife were raped and 
murdered would you still oppose the death penalty 
it took a cast of thousands to make the making of a president 
1988 but all of them the stars the supporting players ingenues 
character actors and animal acts the director stage managers 
coaches and makeup artists none ignited the critics more than the 
blond blueeyed juvenile lead 
with the exception of richard nixon who was almost dropped 
because of a secret fund and geraldine ferraro the first woman to 
be chosen vice presidential nominees make the news the day theyre 
anointed and then theyre gone on the lesser circuits of political 
vaudeville its considered good training for the job 
thus history little noted the mighty labors of lyndon johnson on 
the vice presidential stump in rural virginia in 1960 soaring in 
his peroration pausing descending and then with that sliteyed 
thinlipped high noon look delivering the coup de grace and so 
my friends i ask you what did richard nixon ever do for 
culpepper 
dan quayle was different he couldnt fight his way off the front 
page 
first a story that dan quayle hawk had nested in the national 
guard during the vietnam war with family help then boomboom a 
story that dan quayle student was first rejected by his law school 
for poor grades but finally was admitted how he insisted he got in 
fair and square and not as reported under a program to help 
minorities and the poor of which he was neither 
and now came smiling handsome dan quayle candidate for vice 
president enriching mans search for enlightenment in diverse ways

eventually will go 
marilyn quayle did what she could she protested that her husband 
is intelligent really is the studious sort who tries to read 
platos republic every year 
george bush came perilously close to violating section 4 article 
d of public law 829 which specifically stipulates that the flag 
should never be used as drapery of any sort whatsoever he wrapped 
himself in old glory and never let go 
he said he favored requiring public school teachers to lead 
students in the pledge of allegiance to the flag while his rival was 
opposed in subsequent speeches he wondered aloud why this path 
toward eternal truth was so clear to him and not to dukakis who he 
implied was denying children their birthright he didnt say 
dukakis opposed a mandatory pledge on constitutional grounds 
dukakis went to ellis island and there with the statue of 
liberty behind him and 76 huge american flags waving in the breeze 
he placed his right hand over his heart and pledged his allegiance 
and two days later dan quayle went to the statue of liberty and 
placed his right hand over his heart and pledged his allegiance and 
then the us house of representatives voted to pledge its 
allegiance before every session and bush made a speech before the 
biggest flag imaginable at a flag factory and soon everywhere the 
candidates went flags of all sizes multiplied like crab grass and 
the multitudes were waving small flags given to them to wave small 
plastic flags made in taiwan 
it remained only for ronald reagan to hone the issue he said he 
did not see any reason why they should not learn the various 
customs and so forth that have to do with things of that kind 
for candidates and public alike campaign 1988 proved an 
endurance contest it began more than two years and 876432 speeches 
ago it involved 75 primaries and at the peak 14 candidates until 
two of the democrats were benched for philandering and plagiarism 
finally dukakis beat jesse jackson and four other democrats bush 
licked five republicans and dan rather 
by convention time the two survivors seemed transformed george 
bush exwimp broke from the barrier in full gallop shooting from 
both hips dukakis exdrone seemed almost lyrical in his 
acceptance speech campaigning bush grew more aggressive dukakis 
less poetic 
lloyd bentsen confirmed that dan quayle was no john kennedy but 
otherwise history will have difficulty remembering the debates of 
1988 they provided some canned heat less light most of the time 
the debaters did not answer questions they fudged the beginning of 
an answer and then one two three turned soulful eyes toward 
the camera and with great solemnity rolled through their packaged 
irrelevancies 
on the stump bush fired off zingers like dukakis thinks a naval 
maneuver is something in jane fondas workout book dukakis came out 
foursquare for good jobs at good wages in full stride bush fell 
over pearl harbor day and missed the event by four months dukakis 
bitterly decried the dangers of foreign ownership at a missouri 
factory he didnt know was owned by italians 
bush found some cops to endorse him dukakis found some cops on 
his side bush said that massachusetts is approaching a fiscal 
fiascoa budgetary three mile island dukakis said anyone who 
would say that about his states economy must be suffering from 
meltdown 
bush blamed dukakis for bostons dirty harbor dukakis said bush 
was part of the administrations environmental wrecking crew 
bush said dukakis was soft on crime dukakis said the bush campaign 
was racist 
on a wednesday the dukakis camp issued a fivepage document 
titled george bush distorts mike dukakis record on thursday

two government reports suggesting that consumers are spending 
less and earning less on an inflationadjusted basis provide further 
evidence that the us economy is slowing according to some 
analysts 
the commerce department reported thursday that consumer spending 
slowed last month to its lowest level since a 02 percent decline 
last october personal consumption spending which accounts for 
twothirds of overall economic activity was unchanged in september 
following a 06 percent august rise 
taking the rise in prices into account consumer spending 
actually fell 05 percent last month the department reported 
in addition the government said personal income rose 05 percent 
but the gain was completely erased by rising inflation 
consumers are being more tightfisted because their incomes are 
going nowhere said bruce steinberg an economist with merrill 
lynch amp co inc they already have so much debt that they are 
unwilling to borrow any more 
some economists viewed the report as further evidence of an 
economic slowdown following wednesdays government report that the 
gross national product the broadest measure of the economy grew 
at a slower pace in the third quarter 
the gnp rose at an annual rate of just 22 percent from july 
through september according to that report it was the slowest rate 
in almost two years and followed gnp growth of 32 percent in the 
first half of 1988 
many economists believe the economy will continue slowing over 
the next year with the biggest question being whether growth will 
become so weak that it could topple the country into a recession 
in foreign exchange the dollar firmed against most major 
currencies after falling to its lowest level in four months on 
wednesday market observers attributed the currencys strength to 
apparent central bank intervention although some economists 
predicted the dollar would continue to weaken in new york trading 
the dollar rebounded to 12608 yen from its 12570yen value

after more than a week of overdosing on

speculators a reason to just say no to merger mania 
dragged down by sharp declines in key takeover issues the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials fell 2435 points on thursday 
closing at 214083 
the new wave of multibilliondollar buyouts relies heavily on 
debt and many observers are concerned that the financing of these 
deals ultimately may prove too fragile 
this is not business as usual said robert brusca chief 
economist at nikko securities co international inc of the high 
level of debt mandated in these transactions when you take a 
bluechip company and turn it into a buffalochip company its not 
a good situation 
reflecting skepticism over kohlberg kravis robert amp cos ability 
to fund its 203 billion tender offer for rjr nabisco inc 
nabiscos stock fell 275 share to 82 
other takeover issues also lost substantial ground including 
kraft inc which fell 3 to 9450 west pointpepperell inc 
plunged 337 to 4450 and pillsbury co slipped 212 to 
5887 also down were socalled whisper stocks which had 
risen on spillover speculation 
theres too much debt supporting the nations corporations 
thats what this is telling us said philip puccio a senior vice 
president at dillon read amp co 
amplifying worries over the size of the recent deals were two 
developments in the corporate bond market where the billions 
needed to finance the deals are raised a 115 billion junk bond 
sale for campeau corps takeover of federated department stores hit 
a major snag 
meanwhile federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has urged 
banks to be cautious about lending money for multibilliondollar 
takeovers and buyouts greenspans warning came in a letter to the 
senate banking committee on wednesday 
institutions have participated in so much of this debt 
financing that the financial community is starting to worry 
said puccio theyre afraid that if this thing does keep building 
the way it is and corporate america becomes a house of cards it can 
collapse the way the stock market did 
transactions that are dependent upon a high level of debt are 
losing much of their allure for example wall street journal report 
that us shoe corp is considering a leveraged buyout was said to 
be a factor in sending the companys stock tumbling 137 to 2425 
before the recent rash of deals analysts agree such a report 
would have driven the companys stock higher 
in the junk bond market underwriter first boston corp said that 
while it had not officially withdrawn its offering for the federated 
deal it was engaged in discussions to restructure the transaction 
proceeds from the sale of these highrisk bonds were destined to 
pay off bridge loans used to cover the shortterm costs of the 
campeau takeover announced last spring a delay could spell trouble 
for the banks and investment houses that provided that financing 
if this causes some players to sit on the sidelines because 
they committed too much capital then maybe theyll think twice next 
time brusca said 
because the recent deals all involve huge amounts of borrowed 
money they could be devastated by higher interest rates or the 
inability of a company to sell off assets to cover the debt some 
observers also fear there arent enough investors interested in 
purchasing billions of new junk bonds 
but michael dahood an analyst at smith barney harris upham amp 
co contends there is a hefty appetite for larger deals i dont 
think deals that have a sound economic basis should have any 
difficulty getting funded he said 
the problem however is broader than one firm and one 
transaction 
im concerned about the fact that at any point in time there 
are a lot of firms that are highly leveraged said gregg jarrell 
former securities and exchange commission economist and now a 
professor at the university of rochester 
no one can really know the full extent of what could happen if 
the economy turned down he said

wall street investment firms worried about how to 
escape a postcrash malaise may have an unforeseen problem on their 
hands the new plantclosing law that could constrict their 
flexibility to cut staff 
labor lawyers said thursday that the plant closing bill which by 
its name suggests only bluecollar industries applies to all 
companies employing at least 100 people 
the measure requires employers who close operations and lay off 
large numbers of workers to give employees 60 days advance notice 
and penalizes those that do not 
in the financial services business affected workers could 
include anyone from an 8anhour computer clerk to the 
500000ayear securities research analyst 
i dont think the investment banking houses or brokerage houses 
have focused on this said stuart bompey a labor lawyer at the 
new york firm of baer marks amp upham which represents some big 
financial services concerns such as merrill lynch amp co and dun amp 
bradstreet corp people thought it affected only an industrial 
facility but it clearly affects every employer 
the bill which became law aug 4 comes at a vulnerable time for 
wall street which has been struggling since the october 1987 market 
crash at least 15000 people have been laid off since then and 
there are expectations of that another 5000 could lose their jobs 
moreover considerable confusion surrounds the enforcement date 
of the bill which is supposed to take effect feb 4 it remains 
unclear whether employers must notify workers of layoffs 60 days 
before the february date which would be dec 6 
some lawyers are telling wall street clients to send out the pink 
slips now in case the labor departments employment training 
administration which is drafting regulations to implement the new 
law decides dec 6 is the effective date 
i know attorneys within my firm are advising clients who are 
considering or planning layoffs that fall within the ambiguous 
period to be safe and provide the notice said margaret bryant an 
associate attorney at jackson lewis schnitzler amp krupman in new 
york which specializes in labor law and counsels some of the 
biggest wall street firms 
theres a concern especially as people become more aware of 
it she said certainly clients who call us saying were 
planning a layoff are going to be counseled to the max on what 
this laws provisions are 
the securities industry association a trade group of brokerages 
first sounded the alarm by telling members in a memorandum last 
month that the new plant closing bill applies to all firms 
the memo warned executives and personnel managers that the 
statute is complex and should be carefully reviewed by you andor 
your legal counsel for its implications for your firm 
the worker adjustment and retraining notification act as it 
officially is called penalizes violators by making them pay 
affected employees for each day in which adequate notice isnt 
given which in effect could amount to a maximum of two months 
worth of severance pay violators also must pay the local community 
government 500 for each days violation 
although the law provides for numerous exceptions such as 
unexpected changes in the economy or a natural disaster many 
manufacturers fought the law on grounds it reduced management 
flexibility 
the laws key author sen howard metzenbaum dohio notes the 
inspiration for the law came from the emotional issue of 
manufacturing plant closings and mass layoffs which put more than 
400000 people out of work last year 
it is true that the senator didnt envision wall street when he 
originally offered the bill said nancy coffey his press 
secretary but he also feels all workers deserve adequate notice 
if theyre going to be losing their jobs 
officials of several big brokerages have indicated they are 
considering new layoffs but so far only shearson lehman hutton inc 
has done so the firm confirmed earlier this week that it is laying 
off about 1000 people by yearend

pillsbury co has pursued a costly 
strategy to prevent its shareholders from considering an 
unsolicited 60ashare tender offer from grand metropolitan plc 
the british suitor says in letter to pillsbury chairman philip smith 
the letter was made public thursday after grand metropolitan 
extended by one week its 52 billion offer to purchase the 
minneapolisbased food and restaurant company it said pillsbury has 
refused to meet with grand met to discuss the offer which grand met 
has said is negotiable 
we do not understand how you can explore and investigate all 
available alternatives without meeting with us to discuss our 
proposal the letter said based on your public disclosures our 
offer is the only existing thirdparty proposal to acquire pillsbury 
and you have not made any alternative proposals other than the vague 
statementthat remaining independent would be a superior 
alternative over the long term 
the letter was signed by ian a martin chief executive of grand 
metropolitans us operations and allen sheppard chairman and 
group chief executive in london 
you have refused to meet with us the letter said instead 
you have pursued a costly strategy designed to prevent pillsburys 
stockholders from having an opportunity to consider our offer 
johhny thompson vice president of public relations for 
pillsbury said the company had no response to the tender offer 
extension or the letter 
the tender offer was to expire nov 1 but has been extended at 
the same price until nov 8 said walter montgomery a spokesman for 
grand metropolitan in new york 
smith announced oct 17 that pillsburys directors voted 
unanimously to reject the offer as inadequate and directed 
management to pursue alternatives 
in a letter to pillsbury employees dated wednesday smith said 
the company was not ready to announce alternatives but believed 
pillsbury shareholders should not tender their stock to grand met 
pillsbury stock tumbled 212 a share to 5887 on thursday as 
takeoverrelated stocks took a beating on wall street 
steve carnes a former pillsbury executive who is an analyst with 
piper jaffray amp hopwood inc of minneapolis said the extension 
gives pillsbury some breathing room to plan 
pillsbury declined to comment on reports that its board of 
directors met all day wednesday to consider alternatives to the 
grand met offer 
carnes said he believes pillsburys directors are favoring a 
financial restructuring that could include the sale of burger king 
and other restaurants to raise cash for a special dividend to 
shareholders 
pillsbury is pursuing lawsuits in state courts seeking to block 
the takeover bid on the grounds that liquor producers are barred in 
several states from selling alcohol at retail outlets 
grand metropolitan which has interests in distilling 
restaurants and consumer goods has said it would sell off 
pillsburys steak amp ale and bennigans restaurants because of those 
laws

japans current account surplus dipped 106 percent 
in september from a year earlier to 7605 billion but surged 524 
percent from august the finance ministry announced friday 
in another report the management and coordination agency 
announced japans unemployment rate registered 25 percent in 
september down from 26 percent the previous month 
the surplus in japans current account the broadest measure of a 
nations trade and financial flows has continued to decline from 
yearearlier levels since january in august it registered 4991 
billion while in september 1987 it totaled 8509 billion 
japanese exports in september grew 142 percent from their 
yearearlier level to 22698 billion while imports surged 256 
percent to 13891 billion the ministry said 
ministry officials attributed the yeartoyear decline in the 
current account surplus to the growth of imports particularly of 
manufactured goods they said imports would have increased faster in 
value if they had not been held down by low international oil prices 
but the officials said demand continued to grow overseas for 
japanese exports such as semiconductors video tape recorders 
televisions and office equipment 
tourism payments showed a deficit of 1398 billion down 
slightly from the record 1582 billion deficit recorded the 
previous month 
the officials declined to predict future trends for japans trade 
balance but said exports were likely to remain strong possibly 
endangering efforts by japan to reduce its trade surplus 
the management and coordiantion agency said japanese companies 
continued to actively hire new employees with the number of workers 
in the manufacturing and service sectors rising by 115 million or 
26 percent from a year earlier to 4523 million 
it was the fifth consecutive month in which the number of 
nonfarm employees rose by 1 million or more the total number of 
people employed rose by 840000 or 14 percent to 6064 million 
the agency said 
japans jobless rate would be higher if it were measured by us 
and european standards in japan armed forces personnel and people 
employed more than one hour in the last week of the month when 
statistics are tabulated are considered employed

two powerful members of the wall street 
establishment have joined forces to challenge kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp cos proposed 203 billion buyout of rjr nabisco inc 
the investment firm salomon brothers inc said late thursday it 
was joining shearson lehman hutton inc and a group of top managers 
at rjr nabisco who are considering a challenge to kohlberg kravis 
for control of the atlantabased cigarette and food giant 
the combination of salomon brothers and shearson lehman hutton 
forms a team with extraordinary capital strength and capabilities 
f ross johnson the president and chief executive of rjr nabisco 
said in a prepared statement 
johnson leads the group of managers who last week announced they 
were considering offering to buy the company for 17 billion in 
cooperation with shearson he said numerous other firms had 
expressed interest in supporting a bid 
rjr nabiscos stock rose 75 cents a share to 8275 in early 
trading today on the new york stock exchange it fell 275 a share 
on thursday before salomons entry was announced 
the price decline indicated doubts about the cash value of the 
kohlberg kravis 90ashare tender offer as well as broader concerns 
about the health of the takeover business 
kohlberg kravis which launched its tender offer thursday said 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission it was 
extremely confident it could raise the money to complete the bid 
kohlberg kravis has lined up some bigleague wall street backers 
of its own it said in its sec filing that morgan stanley amp co 
wasserstein perella amp co drexel burnham lambert inc and merrill 
lynch capital markets were assisting it in structuring and financing 
the buyout offer 
analysts said they believed kohlberg kravis could raise the 
money but said that because the offer was not all cash it actually 
was worth less than 90 a share 
rjr nabiscos stock price had been inflated by expectations that 
a higher bid might be forthcoming and the price fell thursday as 
that speculation waned the companys managers originally said they 
were considering an offer of about 75 a share in cash 
dampening the speculative fever for takeover targets were 
comments by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan who has 
contended banks should be cautious about lending too much money for 
leveraged buyouts 
in a sign that it still hoped to avoid fullscale hostilities 
kohlberg kravis said its offer for rjr nabisco was conditioned on 
signing a merger agreement with the board of directors 
since its founding in 1976 kohlberg kravis has never acquired a 
company without the support of the targets board 
getting the support of directors and at least some managers would 
ensure a smoother transition if kohlberg kravis succeeded in taking 
over the company 
kohlberg kravis made its tender offer to shareholders only after 
failing to reach agreement with rjr nabiscos managers and shearson 
on some kind of a joint bid for the company 
kohlberg kravis a privatelyowned partnership has become one of 
the united states largest industrial holding companies by buying 
out companies with the participation of their managers 
in its sec filing kohlberg kravis said it would require about 
2015 billion to buy all of rjr nabiscos shares and to pay related 
fees and expenses it said additional funds might be required to 
cover rjr nabiscos longterm debt which it said is 511 billion 
kohlberg kravis said that if its bid succeeded it anticipated 
selling some of the companys assets but said it had no definite 
plans 
investment firms participating in the deal will reap huge fees 
according to the sec filing about 25 billion of the money raised 
for the deal would go for fees and expenses it was not stated how 
much would be for fees and how much for other types of expenses

attorneys in the washington public power supply 
system securities fraud trial are negotiating for a settlement of 
200 million or more possibly involving all 15 remaining utility 
defendants sources in the case say 
the trial in us district court in tucson ariz was recessed 
suddenly thursday by judge william browning who said he sought the 
break to assist efforts which may be productive in shortening the 
trial 
the trial was adjourned until wednesday and several utility 
officials confirmed meetings were scheduled as early as monday to 
discuss a settlement offer from attorneys for wppss bondholders 
the suit was filed after wppss stopped making payments in 1983 on 
225 billion in bonds the biggest default in municipal bond 
history the bonds had been issued to finance two nuclear power 
projects that were scrapped in 1982 
sources said thursday the proposed settlement could exceed 200 
million would involve the federal bonneville power administration 
and would require approval from the us department of justice 
at bpa headquarters in portland ore bob reed conceded there 
is some activity but referred inquiries to harvey spigal legal 
counsel to the federal powermarketing agency who was not available 
late thursday 
attorneys are working on something and they say theyll tell 
us on monday said bpa spokeswoman karen hoenes 
bpa which backed financing of three other wppss nuclear power 
plants sells and distributes electricity generated at federal dams 
in the pacific northwest and is the regions largest power broker 
with an annual budget of 3 billion 
a proposal has been proposed that i have recommended my clients 
take a look at and discuss said albert malanca attorney for 
tacoma city light one of the largest defendants in the case 
malanca said a special meeting of the tacoma city council and 
utility board was set for monday morning about the same time as a 
meeting of commissioners of the cowlitz county public utility 
district another major defendant 
they will discuss an offer of settlement by the plaintiffs 
said cowlitz pud manager bob mckinney said he added that he 
expected details of the offer to be disclosed at that time 
officials of the klickitat county franklin county and mason 
county no 3 puds also said meetings on the matter were scheduled or 
likely early in the week 
a meeting of snohomish county pud commissioners was set for 
tuesday 
mel weiss an attorney for the bondholders said a settlement 
announcement could come next week he refused to comment further 
except to say that the trial would continue in any event 
besides the 15 utilities defendants include two engineering 
firms and a financial advice firm there has been no talk of 
settlement involving the professional firms and attorneys with two 
of the firms said thursday there were no talks involving their 
clients 
in the trial which began sept 7 and is expected to last as long 
as a year a class of more than 24000 past and present bondholders 
and chemical bank of new york as trustee for bondholders claim 
there was a conspiracy to lie and hide information that might have 
discouraged potential investors 
originally defendants numbered more than 100 including 88 
public utilities that contracted with wppss to build the plants but 
most including wppss itself reached settlements that total 365 
million in cash and 96 million in contested insurance claims over 
the past year 
a 200 million settlement could bring total settlements to 650 
million to 700 million though the default involved 225 billion 
in bonds claims in the suit amount to about 15 billion 
thus the total settlements could approach 50 cents on the dollar 
for bond investors before legal fees

the investor group whose buyout offer was snubbed 
earlier this month by tw services inc said it would begin a 29 a 
share tender offer today as the first step of a proposed 114 
billion takeover of the food services giant 
coniston partners cash tender offer for 1575 million shares 
amounting to about 45675 million if successful would give it a 
majority stake in tw services which on oct 12 rejected the groups 
proposal for a 28 a share buyout 
the group which already owns about 19 percent of tws 485 
million common shares outstanding said thursday it intended 
eventually to acquire the remaining shares of tw in a subsequent 
merger for 29 a share giving the entire buyout an indicated value 
of about 114 billion 
tw had no immediate comment on conistons new offer tw spokesman 
james ryan said today the board will consider it and issue a 
statement afterwards he said ryan said he couldnt specify when 
the tw board will meet 
coniston said the twostep buyout plan was aimed at sidestepping 
restrictions of the antitakeover law of delaware where tw is 
incorporated the group also said it filed a suit in us district 
court for delaware to block the antitakeover law 
the statute prohibits a hostile acquirer who buys 15 percent of a 
companys stock from completing a takeover for three years unless it 
immediately gets approval from 85 percent of the companys 
outstanding shares excluding its own 
acquiring a majority stake would enhance conistons chances of 
winning a shareholder election and would give it substantial power 
over the tw board of directors which is empowered to exempt the 
company from the takeover law 
coniston said that if it succeeded in blocking or setting aside 
the laws requirements it intended to consumate a 29ashare 
merger as soon as practicable 
tw services is parent of the dennys restaurant chain and a major 
franchisee of hardees fast food restaurants in rejecting 
conistons 28 a share offer as inadequate the companys board also 
indicated it believed shareholders would be best served if the 
company remained independent 
coniston indicated at that time it was considering a hostile 
buyout offer 
the tender offer was announced after the close of business on 
thursday and a secretary said no one was available at tw services 
new york headquarters to comment on the offer 
on the new york stock exchange tw closed at 25 share unchanged 
from wednesday 
coniston with a warchest estimated at about 700 million 
typically takes large positions in companies and uses that clout to 
force management to sell the company or make changes that boost the 
stock price it successfully forced a buyout of allegis corp in 
1987 but recently lost a bid to force the sale of gillette co 
although it won an agreement for the company to buy back its 
gillette stock 
in making its initial offer for tw coniston stressed that it was 
interested in owning rather than splitting up and selling the 
company 
when coniston made its 28ashare offer wall street analysts 
agreed with the partnership that the offer was reasonable but some 
estimated that tws breakup value might be as high as 34 a share 
in addition to its 1200 dennys and its 400 hardees fast food 
franchise restaurants new yorkbased tw also runs canteen corp a 
food services concern and a small nursing home chain 
tw reported net income of 472 million on sales of 25 billion 
in 1987

the occupational safety and health 
administration today fined john morrell amp co 433 million the 
largest fine ever against a single employer for what the agency 
said were hundreds of willful safety and health violations at 
the meatpackers sioux falls sd plant 
osha said morrell knew as early as 1984 that working conditions 
at the plant were causing serious and sometimes disabling 
cumulative trauma injuries but did nothing to change those 
conditions 
the companys own injury and illness records showed that 880 of 
2000 employees at the plant sustained such injuries caused by long 
periods of repetitive motion from ay 1987 to april 1988 the 
government said 
this case involves an employer who knew about a serious health 
hazard saw the tragic toll on its workers and chose to ignore it 
said assistant labor secretary john a pendergrass 
osha officials said ergonomics specialists from the national 
institute for occupational safety and health found during an 
inspection begun six months ago that 722 employees were being 
exposed daily to a significant risk of cumulative trauma disorders 
from repeated hand wrist and arm motions the most common form of 
the affliction officials said is carpal tunnel syndrome 
pendergrass said the incidence of cumulative trauma disorders 
among workers at the sioux falls plant was nine times greater than 
the meatpacking industry average of 48 per 100 fulltime workers 
per year and 600 times the rate for all us industries 
morrell said in a statement that it considered the fine grossly 
unfair and totally unjustified the company hinted that it might 
take the matter to court 
pendergrass said that many of the disorders could have been 
easily prevented 
the design of knives for instance can reduce trauma 
pendergrass said adding that the biggest improvement needed was a 
change in the attitudes of management 
under the law morrell has 15 days to pay the fine or appeal it 
to a labor department review board 
in its statement morrell said it was considering seeking an 
injunction to stop osha from singling us out for penalties and 
imposition of arbitrary standards for what is clearly a national 
multiindustry safety and health problem 
morrell also said that its onthejob safety record had improved 
dramatically this year 
morrell said injuries needing to be reported to osha expressed 
as injuries per 1000 fulltime workers had fallen from 705 in 
january to 1675 in october 
the companys statement also maintained that the simplest and 
most reliable method of avoiding excessive repetitive motions 
was varying workers daily routines but the meatpacker said 
union work rules and the grievance process have often been used to 
block such changes 
the 433 million fine was arrived at by calculating penalties 
for what osha officials said were deliberate violations of federal 
safety standards in a willful disregard of the law included were 
5000 fines each half the maximum allowed for 722 workers 
exposed to cumulative trauma disorders which osha said the company 
had made no effort to prevent through available engineering or 
administrative controls 
the company was fined 710000 for what osha called 71 separate 
instances in which workers with the disorder some of whom required 
surgery were given insufficient time off or denied lighter work 
duties while the injuries were healing 
the agency found that 63 workers underwent surgery between may 
1987 and may 1988 but were given an average of only 11 days off 
twentyseven of them had no days off the government said 
niosh recommends 30 to 60 days off depending on the type of 
surgery 
the company was fined 10000 for exposing workers who suffered 
the injuries to the risk of aggravating them by not giving them time 
off 
osha officials said that 93 percent or 817 of the 888 workers 
with recorded trauma disorders had no time off and 39 percent or 
345 had no benefit of temporary work restrictions 
osha last may fined another giant meatpacker ibp corp 31 
million for similar violations at its dakota city neb plant 
previously the largest fine assessed against one employer was a 
411 million levy in 1987 against the bath iron works of maine 
primarily for construction safety violations osha and the company 
last week agreed to a 650000 settlement with bath iron works 
agreeing to a companywide program to end the dangerous conditions 
and a variety of other conditions

the consumer product safety commission voted 
today to ban lawn darts which have been implicated in several 
recent deaths and injuries of children and to extend a ban on 
threewheel allterrain vehicles 
the commission voted 20 to prohibit sale of lawn darts a ban 
which could take effect as soon as december prior to the christmas 
shopping rush 
commissioner carol dawson abstained from the vote but issued a 
plea for adults who already have lawn darts in their homes to keep 
them out of the hands of children 
in the last 10 years an estimated 150 to 200 youngsters have 
suffered severe injuries when these heavy darts struck and 
penetrated their skulls the commission was told 
action on the ban coincided with an unfolding drama in tennessee 
where an 11yearold mcminnville girl was kept comatose after 
undergoing eight hours of emergency surgery to remove a lawn dart 
from her skull the accident occurred as the girl was playing the 
dart game at a neighbors house 
the vote directed the commission staff to prepare a formal ban on 
the darts for publication in the federal register on nov 4 if the 
commission approves the final form of the ban then it could order 
it to take effect 30 days later 
a safety standard for offroad vehicles approved on a 21 vote 
prevents sale of the threewheeled vehicles in this country 
fourwheeled versions which have an accident rate half that of 
the nowbanned atvs still will be sold 
commissioner anne graham voted against the action labeling it 
inadequate 
both issues have attracted widespread attention in recent years 
with reports of deaths and injuries congressional hearings and 
commission investigations into the dangers of the products 
the action today on lawn darts was the latest step following a 
decision announced in july regarding the darts which have been 
blamed for some deaths and an estimated 5000 serious injuries to 
children 
safety standards for allterrain vehicles are the latest step in 
a long and complex process which already has seen the banning of 
future sales of threewheeled atvs 
the standards under consideration would set rules for fourwheel 
vehicles 
whicles are small onerider machines that have become popular 
for use on beaches in woods and for other offroad activities 
there are more than 24 million of the vehicles in use in this 
country and federal officials have blamed them for 1000 deaths and 
up to 300000 injuries in recent years 
prolonged negotiations involving the safety commission justice 
department and several manufacturers resulted in a consent agreement 
approved in april by a federal judge 
the new safety standards worked out with the manufacturers are 
a part of that agreement 
more attention in the last few months has focused on lawn darts 
long darts usually metal tipped which are used in a tossing game 
similar to horseshoes 
david snow of riverside calif whose young daughter was killed 
when one of the darts pierced her brain has led the campaign to 
drive the product from the marketplace 
federal regulations issued in the 1970s banned sales of the darts 
to children and in toy stores but they are still allowed to be sold 
as sporting goods to adults 
in many cases however the darts are included in game sets with 
badminton racquets and volleyball nets and often get into the hands 
of children 
initially the safety commission had proposed to ban darts that 
have the potential for causing skull puncture injuries 
however on oct 21 congress reportedly responding to a 
broadcast news story on the danger passed a bill calling on the 
commission to ban lawn darts that can cause any puncture injury not 
just skull punctures

old dr frankenstein would think he died 
and went to heaven if he could visit two small buildings in central 
texas a leg here an arm there a shelf full of hearts and skulls 
and skeletons by the dozen 
but its not something out a halloween horror movie its the big 
business of bones medical plastics laboratory inc says its 
lifesize reproductions of skeletons rake in millions of dollars 
thousands of the skeletons are used by doctors hospitals and 
medical schools around the world the bones also have made their way 
into rock music videos by the grateful dead and props for the 
miami vice tv series 
theres really no one we cant sell to jerry smith director 
of special projects said recently we have something for 
everybody 
medical plastics is now in its fourth decade of taking a human 
skeleton making molds and duplicating it 
until 1985 real skeletons were imported from india but that 
source was lost when the indian government concerned about grave 
robbing halted such sales 
right now there is a market simply because there are no longer 
human bones available said joe herndon medical plastics 
national sales manager so people have no choice they have to buy 
a plastic or reproduction of a skeleton and we feel we produce the 
one that has the greatest detail 
in the past two years sales of skeletons and other medical 
plastics products such as firstaid training mannequins have doubled 
to 3 million and should approach 5 million a year herndon said 
the company which employs 125 people was started in 1949 by two 
gatesville physicians and a dentist who grew tired of waiting for 
months and months to get a model of a skull 
according to herndon the three were booted out of their homes by 
their wives because the plastics they were experimenting with 
smelled so bad they finally produced their first skull in an old 
chicken coop 
the skull dubbed yorick after the skull in hamlet is 
on display in a glass case in the companys office lobby 
from skulls the company evolved to full skeletons organs and 
training mannequins which account for more than half the business 
according to herndon 
the mannequins which are bought by the government and the armed 
forces are used to teach emergency workers and others how to treat 
wounds administer injections and perform cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation 
some have names mr hurt for example sports a broken nose and 
jaw and a skull fracture 
the key to the companys skeletal success is that the facsimile 
is so detailed it defies detection as artificial 
bones are made from a plastic that has the same consistency 
weight and color as real bones they even react the same under 
xrays 
its got to be perfect said sheli allen one of several 
people who assemble the skeletons if its not perfect then it 
wont look like a real body 
depending on the amount of custom work fullsize skeletons range 
in price from 995 to nearly 3500 less detailed models intended 
for elementary school use start at 365 
despite all efforts however some bones particularly those 
inside the skull and in the nasal cavity defy human attempts to 
copy 
try as we may we do our very best to approximate the skeleton 
but you just cannot duplicate mother nature herndon said

a couple of decades ago the head of one of the 
nations largest banks sought to assure the public about the surge 
of highyield loans being made to third world and other nations 
great consternation was being expressed in various circles 
academe the media banking that the loans were overly risky and 
might not be repaid no fear said the chairman since most of these 
loans were backed by governments 
his goal was to impress on listeners the notion that any 
government would do handstands to avoid default since their credit 
ratings their interest costs and their very economic future would 
be endangered 
it didnt turn out that way and the public paid for it and 
probably continues to do so in the form of higher borrowing costs 
on credit cards mortgages business loans than can reasonably be 
justified 
could something similar be occurring now in the allocation of 
tens of billions of dollars to corporate takeovers like foreign 
loans these too provide big returns to lenders like foreign loans 
they could mean defaults 
and as it was with the foreign loans there are fears being 
expressed by sensible people that some of the loans arent going to 
be paid back on the terms agreed to in the contracts defaults 
entirely possible 
the level of concern was raised this week when federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan advised banks to examine different scenarios 
that might have an impact on collections such as recession or 
periods of high inflation 
in a recession for example a debtburdened company might find 
its repayments already high by most standards extremely difficult 
to meet what would it do what would the bank be able to do 
inflation might pose an even more difficult situation since most 
loans these days rise with the general economic heat 
high interest rates caused many business defaults in the 1970s 
and few real defenses against risk have been created since 
moreover recent history shows that high interest can be accompanied 
by deep recession 
many companies that failed to survive previous bouts of inflation 
and high interest were financially much healthier than some of 
todays highly leveraged buyouts which in the best of times might 
fail if important assets an arm and a leg in human terms cant 
be sold to meet payments 
while the ideal and least damaging way to retire such debt is to 
operate acquired companies more productively that is by reaching 
higher levels of production efficiency there is no assurance it can 
be done 
instead many of the companies will simply sell body parts to pay 
bills sometimes with seriously adverse impact on communities 
others will seek to retire debt by issuing stock becoming 
public again just as they had retired the securities gone 
private by taking on debt such activity might lessen credit 
strains but produce questionable shares 
even if companies bought out in highly leveraged deals continue 
to carry their burden of debt there are implications for the general 
public number one is that this debt burden tends to tie the hand of 
the federal reserve 
since 1973 us corporations have retired 270 billion in 
equities while adding 600 billion in debt in order to save 
industry from disaster the fed might have to keep interest rates 
low thus risking a return of inflation 
no matter what happens the public is affected consider taxes 
dividends are taxed but debt not only is not it brings a rebate 
from uncle sam 
there is one extremely beneficial effect that benefit will come 
if the companies now piling up debt manage to pay their bills by 
operating more efficiently by producing goods and services at 
increasingly lower costs 
in that event the companies and the entire economic community 
would prosper through more jobs greater job assurance lower prices 
and better wages working conditions and goods 
but handled differently the big debts of industry could mean 
higher prices poorer goods higher interest rates a poor quality 
of stocks in which to invest and a superstructure of business that 
would be vulnerable to spills

the takeover fever on wall street has given some 
parts of the corporate bond market a severe case of the chills 
for most of the past week trading of industrial bonds debt 
securities issued mainly by the nations breadandbutter 
manufacturing companies has been at a virtual standstill as 
investors ponder the fallout from the recent spate of megadeals 
these investors which include many large pension funds or 
insurance companies are avoiding industrial bonds for fear the 
companies that issue them despite their size might be future 
takeover targets or aggressors like rjr nabisco inc or kraft inc 
and there are no buyers for the bonds investors currently own 
takeovers have been going on for several years but what has 
changed is that more companies seem to be targets and larger 
companies thought of as immune to takeovers arent thats causing 
quite a stir in the marketplace noted harold goldberg chairman 
of the corporate rating committee of moodys investors service 
two of the biggest buyouts in corporate history have been 
proposed in the last two weeks philip morris cos inc proposed an 
114 billion takeover of kraft which responded with a proposal for 
a 136 billion restructuring of its own the investment firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co made a record 203 billion offer for 
rjr nabisco after management proposed taking the company private in 
a 17 billion leveraged buyout 
earlier in the month pillsbury co received a surprise 523 
billion takeover offer from the british conglomerate grand 
metropolitan plc 
what troubles bondholders is that these deals will be financed 
primarily by borrowed money first through private placement such 
as banks and eventually through the public credit markets that 
will result in higher levels of debt than traditionaly have been 
considered prudent and increase the likelihood that previous debt 
may not be paid off 
that especially worries marshall front an economist at the 
chicago investment and mutualfund management firm stein roe amp 
farnham who says the possibility of an economic recession would 
further exacerbate the problem 
not surprisingly the price of existing bonds of philip morris 
rjr nabisco and kraft have tumbled falling as much as 200 per 
1000 face amount prices of other industrial bonds also have taken 
a beating while yields which move inversely have shot up 
the best way to characterize the market right now is that 
everyone is pretty much in a holding pattern explained james j 
drury a corporate bond analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc nobodys ready to dive in the pool people are just sticking 
their toes in the water 
the hostile climate surrounding industrial bonds also has 
discouraged corporations from bringing to market any further issues 
thereby forcing them to put off various projects and business plans 
or find cash elsewhere 
whats on the bond calendar there really isnt any calendar 
said drury 
one big casualty this past week was a 115 billion offering of 
federated department stores inc underwriters led by first boston 
corp decided to postpone the issue while they restructure the 
transaction 
first boston may have wished it did the same with a 300 million 
issue of eastman kodak co which came to market about two weeks ago 
and reportedly remains largely unsold 
concern about the surge in corporate takeovers has even carried 
over into the eurobond market which trades debt securities issued 
by us and foreign companies outside their boundaries analysts 
said 
they said the yields on some investmentgrade corporate bonds had 
been quoted in the eurobond market as much as three percentage 
points above us treasury bonds with comparable maturities almost 
the same spread as highyield lowrated junk bonds 
goldberg of moodys said his company will add a measure of 
conservatism in how we look at credits where we feel there is a 
susceptibility to event risk a term wall street uses to 
describe things like recapitalizations or lbos 
both moodys and standard amp poors corp another major 
debtrating service already take these factors into consideration 
and try to predict which companies could become takeover targets 
one giveaway is a high cash flow or underperforming stock 
but goldberg said well be taking a harder look at anyone who 
feels they might be subject to a special event 
corporate bond analysts say the only way to revive interest in 
the market is by giving bondholders more protection from event 
risks which traditionally have enriched shareholders 
one way of doing that is by attaching agreements to bond issues 
that protect bond investments from possible buyouts and ensure that 
no corporate transaction could benefit shareholders at the expense 
of bondholders

at the crest of the new megamerger wave kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp cos 203 billion bid for rjr nabisco inc was 
greeted with heady confidence 
like the fourminute mile a onetime barrier that has been left 
in the dust by a generation of faster runners the 20 billion mark 
appeared to be a stepping stone on the path to even bigger deals 
but in the wake of tough questions about the financing of these 
transactions the new benchmark is looking more like bob beamons 
1968 long jump an elusive record that may not be broken for years 
to come 
some attributed beamons astounding jump which remains one of 
the oldest records in track and field to the rarified air of mexico 
city the environment on wall street seemed similarly primed a few 
weeks ago when the first of more than 40 billion in new takeovers 
buyouts and restructurings was announced 
the acquisition business seemed to have mushroomed to some sort 
of emotional and financial extreme said hugh johnson senior vice 
president at first albany corp 
the succession of deal announcements came at rapidfire pace 
grand metropolitan plc surprised pillsbury co with a 52 billion 
bid philip morris cos inc offered 11 billion for kraft inc 
kraft responded with a 136 billion restructuring rjr nabisco 
managers said they were considering going private in a 17 billion 
deal kohlberg kravis countered with its unprecedented tender offer 
farley inc bid 14 billion for textile giant west pointpepperell 
inc among others 
not only did we get a lot of deals but they were big deals 
johnson said yet when investors and observers started focusing on 
the business ramifications of these huge transactions everybody 
came away with an uncomfortable feeling he added 
indeed some of the bigger deals are being looked at more 
carefully and critically said joseph bartlett a partner in the 
law firm gaston amp snow who served as undersecretary of commerce in 
the johnson administration 
adding to concerns about the high and potentially dangerous 
levels of debt needed to support these buyouts were words of 
warning from federal reserve chairman alan greenspan who cautioned 
banks to exercise discretion in granting loans to dealmakers for 
fear a recession could turn megadeals into megadefaults 
further the delay of the sale of 115 billion in junk bonds 
needed to finance campeau corps huge takeover of federated 
department stores inc served as an indication that this is not a 
perpetualmotion machine bartlett said 
if canadian investor robert campeau has bitten off more than he 
can chew maybe these deals are not so easy to do he added 
it was not long before investors began to focus on the darker 
side of the takeover scene they began to realize that even if some 
of the deals could be pulled off the resulting companies would be 
awash in debt 
the dependence on debt has led us to recognize the warning 
that this might not be healthy for corporate america johnson 
said pointing to the fact that while nabisco stock initially rose 
on the takeover talk the price of its bonds plunged 
later in the week mounting fears sent the prices of takeover 
stocks sharply lower and the stocks of companies rumored to be 
potential buyout targets fell in tandem several issues recovered 
some of the lost ground on friday 
the crisis will come if buyers dont materialize for the 
highyield highrisk junk bonds used to finance the deals or if the 
leveraged companies are unable to sell off some unneeded assets to 
pay down their debts 
among those immediately affected would be banks particularly 
those that made what they thought were shortterm loans to tide the 
companies over until bonds or assets could be sold 
no one knows what exactly triggered the feeding frenzy in the 
first place but bartlett suspects the upcoming election is playing 
at least a supporting role 
theres a shiver in the market that either bush or dukakis 
once in office will tighten up on the regulation of the securities 
markets and make takeovers more difficult from a tax standpoint 
he said referring to the outcome of the presidential election 
bartlett noted that the government essentially finances more than 
a third of the cost of leveraged buyouts by allowing interest 
deductions on the debt thats a loophole he said would be easy to 
close 
you could say if a company is too highly leveraged then only 
half the interest is deductible for example 
many argue that the participants in these deals from those who 
reap huge fees issuing junk bonds or loans to those who purchase the 
debt are ultrasavvy investors who know what theyre getting into 
that doesnt lessen the risks however 
johnson thinks recent events will prove to be a watershed for the 
buyout business not only does he think takeover activity will 
subside as investors continue to focus on the financial fragility of 
these deals but he called 20 billion a benchmark that wont be 
broken for some time

the reagan administration said today that the 
federal budget deficit was 1551 billion in the justcompleted 
budget year up 36 percent from fiscal 1987 
the administrations final accounting for the budget year which 
ended sept 30 showed that the imbalance between revenues and 
spending rose 54 billion from last year when it was 1497 
billion 
the office of management and budget previously reported the 1987 
deficit at 1504 billion but with the release of todays report 
refigured it at 1497 billion 
the budget gap was still well below the alltime record of 2211 
billion set in the 1986 fiscal year 
red ink for the year exceeded both the initial administration 
projection of 1467 billion issued in february and the updated 
estimate of 1523 billion released in july it hit the 
congressional budget office projection of 155 billion nearly 
exactly 
in a joint statement the treasury department and the white 
houses office of management and budget attributed 3 billion of the 
overrun to spending by the federal home loan bank board the agency 
that rescues insolvent savings institutions it spent 81 billion 
in 1988 3 billion more than expected at midsummer 
the agency in a spate of activity from midaugust through the 
end of september pledged more than 16 billion to rescue 60 sampls 
however much of the spending doesnt show up on the budget 
the federal government spent a record 1064 trillion during the 
12month period up 6 percent from 1987 receipts were 909 billion 
up 64 percent from a year ago 
the administration is predicting a budget deficit for the current 
1989 fiscal year of 1455 billion but most private analysts expect 
even less progress 
the flood of government red ink has been blamed for the nations 
chronic trade imbalance for holding interest rates above historic 
averages and for helping to trigger last years stock market crash 
president reagan and congressional leaders struck a budget pact 
last winter after the crash that has held the deficit almost to 
last years level but economists say there wont be additional 
shrinkage without painful budget cuts or a tax increase 
a blue ribbon bipartisan commission has been meeting this summer 
and after the election will offer the new president its 
recommendations however republican george bush has promised to 
reject the recommendation if it includes a tax increase democrat 
michael dukakis has promised to consider the recommendations but 
has proposed no tax increases and few spending cuts

coniston partners which launched a tender offer 
to acquire food service giant tw services inc said friday it would 
sell off the companys small health services operations if the deal 
is successful 
the aggressive investment firm also said citibank has agreed to 
provide 750 million to finance what would be a 114 billion 
acquisition 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission coniston 
said it would sell american medical services a milwaukeebased 
company that operates 27 skillednursing facilities and two 
retirement living centers in wisconsin california colorado and 
illinois 
the operation which employs about 4100 people reported revenue 
of 100 million last year it is a very small part of tws overall 
operations which include the dennys and hardees restaurant chains 
coniston principal paul e tierney jr said the partners paid a 
5 million fee in order to secure citibanks participation as 
primary lender in the deal 
while most acquirers try to postpone paying fees until a deal is 
closer to completion tierney said coniston did not want anyone to 
think this deal couldnt be financed 
he also said the agreement with citibank indicates that this is 
clearly different from other instances where we havent tried to buy 
a company but instead promoted its restructuring 
coniston which was snubbed earlier this month by tw began a 
29ashare tender offer friday 
the cash tender offer for 1575 million shares amounting to 
about 45675 million if successful would give it a majority stake 
in tw which on oct 12 rejected the groups proposal for a 28 a 
share buyout 
the group which already owns about 19 percent of tws 485 
million common shares outstanding intends to acquire the remaining 
shares of tw in a subsequent merger for 29 a share giving the 
entire buyout an indicated value of about 114 billion

platinum valued most highly as a jewelry metal in japan and as 
an industrial metal elsewhere is developing a third personality as 
an investment metal thanks to a threat of tight supplies and a new 
crop of platinum coins 
actually an appreciable smallinvestment market for the white 
metal has existed since 1982 when platinum bars and coins weighing 
10 troy ounces or less became available 
but the recent releases of the oneounce australian koala and 
chinese panda coins and the oneounce platinum dragon medallion from 
british refiner johnson matthey plc have expanded the choices for 
small investors 
canada is expected to launch a oneounce platinum maple leaf coin 
in the near future which is likely to attract a good many north 
american buyers experts say 
we expect the market for platinum as an investment metal to 
become as regular a feature as that for gold or silver johnson 
matthey the worlds largest platinum refiner said recently in its 
annual platinum market review and forecast 
according to the firms figures small investment demand for 
platinum last year in the nonsoviet world amounted to 215000 troy 
ounces down sharply from 450000 ounces in 1986 but still a large 
amount compared with the 45000 ounces purchased by small investors 
in 1982 the smallinvestor segment accounted for 15 percent of 
platinum demand in 1987 
analysts linked last years buying slump to profittaking by 
investors following platinums 38 percent rise in value during 1986 
when the price for spot delivery on the new york mercantile exchange 
rose from about 340 to 470 an ounce 
platinums value has continued to rise albeit more slowly 
gaining 5 percent during 1987 and nearly 10 percent so far this 
year platinum for january delivery on the new york merc closed 
friday at 54380 a troy ounce 
most experts recently have turned more bullish on platinum based 
on johnson mattheys forecast for a 450000ounce supply shortfall 
this year and continued supply tightness through 1992 
johnson matthey predicted an increase in small investment demand 
for platinum this year due to both the bullish supplydemand 
picture and the new coins 
goldcorp australia which launched its koala coin on sept 22 
had hoped the koala would make a big splash in japan where the 
yens strength against the dollar has made highly prized platinum 
jewelry more affordable platinum is denominated in us dollars on 
the world market 
instead the koala has met with its greatest early success in the 
united states said stephen m gotwald a vice president of goldcorp 
australia and general manager of its north american operations 
we had an objective of 100000 ounces in north american 
sales he said if i said i was pleasantly surprised that would 
not express my sheer joy at how well this coin has done if i said 
150 percent of my initial expectations i would not be overstating 
it 
platinum as an investment is a more accepted notion in north 
america than in japan according to johnson mattheys statistics 
investment buying accounted for more than 9 percent of north 
american demand last year while in japan it accounted for less than 
4 percent 
one reason for the relatively weak japanese investment interest 
in platinum may be the popularly held japanese belief that platinum 
is the best of all possible jewelry metals 
platinum is perceived as the ultimate metal for jewelry said 
sadako fujikawa the tokyo representative for platinum guild 
international a usbased marketing asssociation 
platinum is not ostentatious she said the japanese 
esthetic value is tranquil quiet subdued so something that is not 
ostentatious is a virtue 
she said gold jewelry was perceived by the japanese as showy and 
glitzy so they tend to think of gold as more of an investment metal 
golds investment value is understood but as a jewelry metal 
platinum is seen as being more valuable 
while jewelrymaking totaled more than half of japans platinum 
use last year jewelry accounted for less 2 percent of platinum 
demand in north america in 1987 
industrial use especially as a component in automobile 
pollutioncontrol systems accounted for nearly 82 percent of north 
american platinum demand last year according to johnson matthey

michael milken drexel burnham lambert 
incs highyield bond chief whos at the center of a federal 
insidertrading probe says the ordeal of the nearly 2yearold 
investigation has taken a personal toll 
the last 20 months have been very painful the strain has been 
enormous milken said in a rare interview published friday in the 
trentonian newspaper am i operating at my fullest capacity no 
will my life be shorter possibly i dont know how many more 
wrinkles there are on my heart 
the trentonian is owned by ingersoll publications co whose 
chief executive ralph ingersoll is a personal friend of milkens and 
a drexel client 
ingersoll has been an outspoken defender of milken and has 
accused the government of creating a witchhunt atmosphere against 
the wealthy 42yearold investment banker who is considered a 
pioneer in the 100 billion market for highyield noninvestment 
grade securities commonly called junk bonds 
drexel milken and three other key employees were accused by the 
securities and exchange commission of insider trading stock 
manipulation and other civil fraud charges sept 7 after a long 
investigation by the enforcement agency stemming from disclosures 
from nowimprisoned speculator ivan boesky 
more serious criminal charges have been expected since federal 
prosecutors notified the firm earlier this month that it was the 
target of a grand jury investigation the defendants have denied any 
wrongdoing 
milken declined to discuss the accusations against him in the 
interview but instead stressed what he called his deep affection 
for his family and extensive philanthropic activities he downplayed 
the importance he has placed on his highflung career 
professional milestones he said pale in significance to a sons 
problems with seizures and his fathers bout with cancer 
my first bond issue he asked it was less satisfying than 
finding out what was wrong with greg less satisfying than learning 
his son lance was chosen valedictorian 
a dream day he added would begin with my wife calling me to 
says shes pregnant 
a native californian who parlayed drexel to the forefront of 
highyield bond underwriting milken is known for working 12hour 
days seven days a week he reportedly makes 40 million a year 
his wife a high school sweetheart whom milken married at 22 
remains fiercely proud and defensive of him 
ive told the children your father is a genius and has 
revolutionized the finance industry lori milken said in the 
ingersoll interview 
people dont like change and theyre trying to get rid of 
your father and if you look in your history books youll see that 
people who have tried to make change have had this happen 
whatever his fondness for family milken denied wishing he could 
go back and pursue a lowerprofile career 
leave no mark in the sand he asked no i havent reached 
that point yet

the american telephone amp telegraph co on 
friday won a spirited competition to provide thousands of new 
computers to the defense department establishing its position in 
the industry for years to come with what has been described as the 
computer contract of the century 
the contract awarded friday was worth 9291 million 
atampt officials said its value could ultimately exceed 1 billion 
depending on the options exercised 
the air force which acted as the agent for the other services in 
overseeing the bidding said an atampt subsidiary atampt technologies 
inc had been selected over five competitors and would now be 
expected to deliver some 20000 minicomputers over the next five 
years 
among the losers were the zenith data systems corp the lockheed 
missiles amp space co the planning research corp honeywell federal 
systems and international business machines corp 
air force leaders hailed the results of the competition saying 
the pentagon had pushed the industry into a new round of 
pricecutting 
we are going to completely rewrite the industrys cost formulas 
for equipment of this type with this contract said andrew e 
bilinski a deputy assistant secretary of the air force for 
acquisition 
the air force and pentagon had originally estimated it would cost 
up to 45 billion to acquire 20000 of the machines 
the air force is buying the computers for its own use as well as 
that of the army navy coast guard defense communications agency 
and defense logistics agency from the start the contract was 
recognized as being so large that it could ensure the winner a 
strong position in the highly competitive industry for years to come 
atampt although a relative newcomer to the computer ranks thanks 
to the 1984 breakup of the bell system had widely been considered a 
frontrunner in the competition 
that was because the air force in a bid to standardize what is 
now a maze of computer systems throughout the defense department 
specified that all bidders must propose computers that could operate 
on unix a computer software program developed by atampt 
the unix system although owned by atampt is now widely licensed 
to other vendors and can be used to operate many different 
computers the air forces decision however prompted a legal 
challenge that delayed the award for almost a year and ultimately 
ended with two industry giants the digital equipment corp and 
wang laboratories withdrawing from the competition 
digital and wang charged unsuccessfully the air force had 
rigged the competition with the decision to specify unix 
compatibility 
atampt was allowed to enter unregulated markets like computer 
manufacturing thanks to its 1984 settlement of an antitrust suit 
filed by the justice department by agreeing to spin off its 23 
local bell system companies atampt was granted the freedom to pursue 
virtually any business lines it wanted 
herb linnen an atampt spokesman in washington hailed fridays 
award describing it as the largest computer contract ever awarded 
by the federal government 
linnen said the contract has a potential value in excess of 1 
billion depending upon the options exercised 
winning this contract firmly establishes atampt as a leader in 
the federal computer marketplace added warren g corgan the vice 
president of atampts federal systems division 
this project is a very large systems integration undertaking 
an assignment that plays to atampts strength he added 
robert m kavner the president of atampts data systems group 
said the contract also was the largest atampt had won since it entered 
the computer business commercially four years ago 
it is a great shot in the arm for our data systems business 
he said 
the air force in announcing the award said atampt would perform 
most of the work in greensboro nc and oklahoma city okla it 
said 363 bids were solicited and six proposals were received

october 1988 has been no prizewinning month for 
the stock market but considering the historical alternatives many 
investors will take it without much complaint 
with one session left on monday before the month ends stock 
market averages show some modest gains since the end of september 
stocks got through the first anniversary of black monday on oct 
19 relatively unscathed indeed two days later several market 
indicators reached their highest levels since the crash 
if there is a sense of relief on wall street as the month draws 
to a close however there is very little elation 
the markets rally since late summer has failed to impress many 
analysts who note that it has done little to lift the prices of the 
many small to mediumsize issues known as secondary stocks 
business remains bad in many areas of the securities industry as 
witness the planned layoffs of about 1000 employees announced by 
shearson lehman hutton a few days ago 
on top of all that many analysts worry that what activity has 
occurred in the market lately is dangerously speculative based as 
it is on a frenzy of takeover deals and rumors 
in the view of a good many observers both the buyout specialists 
who acquire stocks with borrowed money and the traders who follow in 
their wake are engaged in the kind of activity that often comes at 
market peaks 
one of the mesmerizing ingredients of market tops is the latest 
fad said justin mamis an analyst at cowen amp co 
fads whether they be toys or hot tips or tulip bulbs provide 
excitement motivation to buy and a justification for paying a lot 
of money for something you hadnt realized was so desirable before 
the bidding wars culminate in topofthemarket prices meaning 
someone eventually will wind up a loser because thats the nature of 
markets 
warnings of that sort have struck home lately prompting a 
selling squall in the stocks of many companies involved in takeover

stocks have risen for other reasons like strong earnings 
dividend increases and continued economic growth said john 
connolly at dean witter reynolds inc 
indeed general motors shares were a conspicuous gainer in the 
past week rising against the tide of takeover jitters on the 
strength of a much betterthanexpected quarterly earnings report 
still observed connolly we wonder what would have happened to 
the market had not 150 billion in equities been retired through 
merger and acquisition 
some of this money has obviously been recycled and has helped 
the stock prices of lots of companies not even remotely involved

the federal budget deficit after dramatically 
improving last year grew in fiscal 1988 to 1551 billion the 
reagan administration reported friday 
the administrations final accounting for the budget year that 
ended sept 30 showed that the imbalance between revenues and 
spending rose 54 billion or 36 percent from the previous years 
1497 billion deficit 
but treasury secretary nicholas f brady in a joint statement 
with the white house office of management and budget said the 
underlying trend in the deficit remains downward 
the 1988 budget gap was still well below the alltime record of 
2211 billion set in the 1986 fiscal year 
brady said special factors such as the phasein of the new tax 
law in 1987 the sale of the federally owned conrail freight 
railroad and a oneday shift of military pay from 1987 into 1988 
either shrank the 1987 deficit or inflated the 1988 gap 
excluding the onetime factors the deficit would have fallen by 
311 billion between 1987 and 1988 he said 
red ink for the year exceeded both the initial administration 
projection of 1467 billion issued in february and the updated 
estimate of 1523 billion released in july it hit the 
congressional budget office projection of 155 billion nearly 
exactly 
however the deficit was well below initial projections of 
private economists who feared last year that the october stock 
market crash would slow economic growth cutting into tax 
collections and producing a deficit as high as 185 billion 
the administration said its midsummer projection was off because 
it underestimated spending by the federal home loan bank board the 
agency that rescues insolvent savings institutions the board spent 
81 billion in fiscal 1988 3 billion more than expected 
the board in a spate of activity from midaugust through the end 
of september rescued more than 60 savings and loans however much 
of the spending doesnt show up on the budget immediately and 
analysts say assistance to the ailing sampl industry could contribute 
15 billion a year to the deficit over the next three years 
there have now been deficits in 27 of the past 28 years running 
up a total accumulated national debt of 261 trillion the last 
year the united states had a budget surplus was 1969 when 
government revenues exceeded spending by 32 billion 
the administration is predicting it will whittle down the budget 
deficit for the current fiscal year to 1455 billion but most 
private analysts expect less progress 
the flood of government red ink has been blamed for the nations 
chronic trade imbalance for holding interest rates above historic 
averages and for helping to trigger last years stock market crash 
president reagan and congressional leaders last winter struck a 
budget pact after the crash that has held the deficit almost to the 
1987 level but economists say there wont be additional shrinkage 
without painful spending cuts or a tax increase 
analysts also expect the federal reserve board to fight inflation 
by nudging up interest rates to slow the economy higher interest 
rates will add to the escalating cost of financing the accumulated 
national debt while slower growth will cut into tax revenue 
a bipartisan commission on the deficit has been meeting since 
summer and after the nov 8 election will offer the new president 
its recommendations 
however republican nominee george bush has promised to reject 
the recommendation if it includes a tax increase democrat michael 
dukakis while promising to consider the report so far has proposed 
no tax increases and few spending cuts 
the federal government spent a record 1064 trillion during 
fiscal 1988 up 6 percent from 1987 receipts were 909 billion up 
64 percent from a year earlier 
the largest spending categories were the military followed by 
social security interest on the national debt and other programs in 
the department of health and human services 
military spending totaled 2819 billion in 1988 up 29 percent 
from the same period a year earlier spending for social security 
totaled 2142 billion up 58 percent interest on the national 
debt was a record 2141 billion up 96 percent 
the other hhs programs including medicare and medicaid spent 
1590 billion in 1988 up 67 percent

general motors corps report of record 
thirdquarter earnings has left auto analysts split over whether the 
automaker is headed back to significant profitability 
gm the worlds largest indutrial corporation reported thursday 
that it earned 8592 million during the julytoseptember period 
analyst wendy beale of smith barney inc said friday that she 
felt the results indicated gm was on the way back 
the costcutting was there in the second quarter and most 
people ignored it she said it was there in the third quarter 
too 
but analyst douglas laughlin of bear stearns amp co was skeptical 
about 99 percent of the analysts can delineate the turnaround 
story he said im in the dont camp 
the size of gms profit for the third quarter which amounted to 
240 a share surprised many analysts some of whom were predicting 
earnings of a dollar a share less 
if a onetime accounting change gm exercised in the third quarter 
of 1987 is taken into account the companys profit for the quarter 
doubled over the julyseptember period last year if it isnt taken 
into account gms earnings increased 58 percent 
the profit also broke a fourquarter streak in which ford motor 
co outearned the muchlarger gm on wednesday ford reported a 
8563 million thirdquarter profit an industry record that held 
for one day 
gm said its earnings came on healthy north american sales strong 
overseas performance and a costcutting program that was beginning 
to take hold 
we are seeing increasingly strong bottomline benefits of the 
reindustrialization undertaken by gm in the 1980s gm chairman 
roger b smith and president robert stempel said in a joint 
statement thursday its clear that our yeartoyear earnings 
improvement is the result of the efforts of the entire gm team to 
build outstanding vehicles and to cut costs 
another of those taking a waitandsee approach about gms 
prospects was beth fusco of moodys investor services 
the problem is when a companys had a bunch of 
lessthanstellar management decisions youre always trying to 
second guess them she said i think a healthy degree of 
skepticism is in order until proved otherwise 
analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton inc said gm 
may have turned a financial corner 
i think it signals the beginnings of the turnaround the big 
question is sustainability he said if the market softens 
their earnings are going to be in trouble 
most financial analysts expect industrywide sales would fall 
somewhere below the 156 million cars and light trucks sold during 
the 1988 model year 
for the past year gm has been steadily increasing its earnings 
until the third quarter when profits typically are lower because of 
factory retooling in preparation for the model year which 
traditionally begins oct 1 
during that year however gms market share has slipped from 
around 51 percent to around 49 percent a development that is a 
concern to all analysts 
thats the problem phillippi said this is a lot of good 
news but theyve still got a market share problem if auto 
sales stay constant and they dont start to score some market 
share gains theyre going to be facing an inventory bubble in 
the latter part of the fourth quarter 
with a continuing erosion in market share push has got to come 
to shove fusco said theyve got to push those cars out the 
door with incentives but incentives are going to hit them on 
the other side 
chrysler corp knows about that kind of damage 
the nations no 3 automaker which relied heavily on 
profiteating incentives during the thirdquarter reported its 
earnings fell 543 percent to 1125 million in the period this year 
compared with 246 million in the same period last year

kohlberg kravis roberts amp co charged friday that 
managers of rjr nabisco inc may be trying to sell off 
substantial pieces of the food and tobacco giant a move that 
would make it less attractive in the face of the investment firms 
203 billion tender offer 
in a letter to charles hugel chairman of rjr nabiscos special 
committee of outside directors kohlberg kravis said it had been 
advised that rjr nabisco managers and their partners were actively 
attempting to sell significant portions of the company and may 
have provided potential buyers with financial and other information 
about the businesses they seek to sell 
the powerful buyout firm declined to identify which businesses it 
believed rjr nabisco president f ross johnson and his financial 
partners shearson lehman hutton inc and salomon inc were trying 
to sell 
however when johnson announced last week that management was 
considering a 17 billion plan to take nabisco private he indicated 
he would sell off much of the companys nabisco food operations 
rjr nabiscos managers ended talks with kohlberg kravis on 
wednesday about making a joint offer to buy the company from 
stockholders 
a spokeswoman at rjr nabiscos headquarters in atlanta said the 
company had no comment on kohlberg kraviss letter a spokesman for 
shearson said the investment house had no immediate comment 
rjr nabisco stock rose 3 a share to 85 in composite new york 
stock exchange trading 
kohlberg kravis said it believed food business competitors of 
nabisco were among the potential buyers already lining up for sale 
talks 
selling assets to competitors could be detrimental to the 
companys business from a competitive point of view and have a 
deleterious effect on the employees of those businesses the 
letter said 
kohlberg kravis essentially is alleging that rjr nabisco may be 
in the process of employing a scorchedearth policy which is 
the name wall street has given the tactic of a takeover target 
selling off assets in an attempt to make itself less attractive 
it makes the company less than whole it can make it 
impossible to do the deal said edward froelich an analyst at 
pershing amp co 
if kohlberg kravis is serious about the charge analysts said it 
likely will file suit seeking to prevent rjr nabisco from proceeding 
with the sale of any assets 
if they dismember the animal obviously you have to change your 
bid froelich said referring to the 90ashare tender offer 
kohlberg kravis launched on thursday 
kohlberg kravis said in the letter that it did not contemplate 
dismemberment of the companys operations the firm said it would 
retain all of rjr nabiscos tobacco businesses and a significant 
portion of the food operations if its takeover bid succeeded 
rjr nabisco has a plethora of highprofile brand name products 
including oreo cookies and ritz crackers that analysts say are 
extremely attractive properties 
theyve got tons of stuff that already has shelf space and 
market domination froelich said 
on the tobacco side the companys rj reynolds unit makes 
winston and camel cigarettes among others 
separately kohlberg kravis offered in its letter to allow a 
significant number of rjr nabisco managers an equity investment in 
the takeover the firm also noted that it intended to retain 
substantially all of the companys employees in the operations 
which are not divested 
principals henry kravis and george roberts indicated that they 
met on thursday with hugel president of stamford connbased 
combustion engineering inc the letter outlined the points kravis 
and roberts made in that meeting 
according to their impression of the meeting hugel indicated a 
willingness to establish a process providing us with an 
opportunity to meet with management and have access to certain 
nonpublic information

the federal governments record health 
and safety fine levied friday against john morrell amp co follows 
years of disputes over working conditions at the companys 
meatpacking plant here 
in announcing the 433 million levy the occupational safety and 
health administration said the cincinnatibased company did little 
or nothing in light of hundreds of serious injuries caused by jobs 
requiring repetitive motion on the meatpacking line 
osha officials said they conducted a sixmonth investigation 
after workers complained 
morrell the nations fifth largest meatpacker said it would 
seek a federal court order on monday blocking the fine 
the fine drew praise from the leader of the meatpackers union 
local at the plant 
we actually congratulate osha for doing their job during this 
present administration we found that getting osha to do their job 
sometimes was very difficult said jim lyons president of local 
304a of the united food and commercial workers union 
lyons union bargains for workers at the sioux falls plant a 
sixmonth strike ended in november 1987 but only about 500 union 
workers got their jobs back the remainder of the estimated 
2000member work force is made up of replacement workers 
lyons charged morrell did nothing to alleviate work place 
problems despite many complaints from workers 
we brought that problem to them we addressed it with them many 
times he said they knew ways of preventing it and not only 
that we found their medical mismanagement to be incredible a large 
incredible problem and obviously osha found our account to be 
accurate 
morrell officials contended the company was being singled out for 
penalties in what is a national safety and health problem affecting 
many industries 
it was the seventh time in almost two years that the meatpacker 
had been cited for safety problems 
in april 1987 osha fined morrell 690000 for alleged 
recordkeeping violations dealing with injuries it was the largest 
osha fine against the company prior to fridays announcement 
an administrative law judge in denver dismissed the fine earlier 
this week however saying the time limit for levying the fine had 
expired 
the most recent osha fine was in september a 28900 fine for 
alleged safety violations stemaming from a plant inspection last 
spring the company also contested that citation 
workers have complained that morrell increased the speed of its 
production lines at the meatpacking plant and that injury rates 
soared accordingly 
when word of the potential osha fine leaked earlier this year 
steve crim the plant manager wrote a memo to employees saying the 
problems were in the past they occurred before new management 
took over both here and in cincinnati he said 
donald slotkin former president and chief executive officer 
resigned a year ago and was replaced by milton schloss corporate 
offices were moved from a chicago suburb to cincinnati in april 
morrell is owned by united brands co of cincinnati 
morrell hired a fulltime safety director in january to help at 
its plants in sioux falls and sioux city iowa company officials 
contend the injury rates have been reduced but lyons said friday 
that company records show more than half the work force has had 
injuries or illnesses during the first eight months of the year 
the company said the sioux falls plant had the best safety record 
in company history in september 
but union officials said morrell documents do not include injured 
workers who get first aid and are sent back to work 
osha officials said the incidents of repetitive motionrelated 
disorders at the sioux falls plant was nine times higher than the 
industry average and 600 times the rate for all us industries 
morrell however said the injuries that had to be reported fell 
from 705 per 1000 fulltime workers in january to 1675 in october 
safety and work conditions at the aging plant have been points of 
contention many times between the company and the union the oldest 
parts of the plant were built in 1909 
morrell and the union have been at loggerheads dozens of times 
including strikes contract deadlocks lawsuits and appearances 
before regulatory boards 
the company and the union are in the middle of talks for a new 
contract at the plant morrell has asked for wage cuts ranging from 
125 an hour to 175 an hour to a base rate of 8 an hour union 
officials have said that if the company continues to push for wage 
cuts a strike is possible 
the contract expires nov 20

copper futures prices skyrocketed friday on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for december delivery soaring more than 7 
cents a pound in a decisive technical move that analysts said 
portends even higher prices 
on other markets precious metals also rallied strongly soybeans 
scored sharp gains while grains were mixed energy futures were 
mostly higher livestock and meat were mixed and stockindex 
futures advanced 
copper for delivery in december settled 705 cents higher at 
1397 a pound the lightly traded spot november contract gained 
995 cents settling at 14445 
the fundamental copper factors of strong demand and tight 
supplies exacerbated by a nearly 2weekold peruvian miners strike 
were unchanged friday analysts said 
the commodity exchanges release of weekly statistics showing a 
further drawdown of warehouse copper stocks to 6863 short tons 
confirmed that us supplies have continued to shrink and 
expectations that the london metal exchange will report a further 
drawdown of its warehouse stocks on monday prompted some of fridays 
buying 
but analysts said coppers stongest buy signal was its own chart 
pattern the past weeks 10centsapound decline was simply too 
small and too slow to represent a real turnaround in the markets 
nearly straightup advance over the past two months 
it was a pretty good decline but when a market like copper is 
going to decline it usually is going to do it a little more 
dramatically said craig sloane metals futures analyst with smith 
barney harris upham amp co when it goes it goes too fast for 
anyone to get in 
similar chart interpretations encouraged bullish speculators to 
reenter the copper market in hopes that prices will rise even 
higher perhaps as high as 175 a pound 
theres no way of telling how high this thing will go sloane 
said 
analyst peter cardillo of josephthal amp co in new york said the 
south american supply situation would dictate the markets direction 
until you see a definite end to that peruvian strike were 
going to continue to go higher he said 
precious metals prices leaped in early trading and finished 
sharply higher on unconfirmed rumors that syrian troops had invaded 
lebanon 
there was little other news to affect the precious metals friday 
but cardillo said investors both in the us and abroad appeared to 
be shifting their money from stocks to the relative safety of the 
metals

bond prices finished higher in light trading 
friday amid lingering investor concern about risky takeover 
financing and strengthening conviction that the economy is slowing 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond climbed 932 point 
or about 280 for every 1000 in face value 
its yield which moves inversely to price and often indicates 
interest rate trends declined to 880 percent from 883 percent 
late thursday 
dealers said investors were continuing to move away from equities 
and corporate securities and into governmentbacked treasury issues 
investors say the rash of recent corporate takeovers and takeover 
attempts has raised the risk of investing in stocks and corporate 
bonds 
while the stock market recouped most of thursdays losses the 
dow jones average of 30 industrials ended the week with a net loss 
of 3361 points 
there was a leftover flight to quality from yesterday said 
kevin flanagan an economist with dean witter reynolds inc 
bond prices weakened early in the day after a spurt in precious 
metals prices prompted by false rumors of possible syrian hostility 
against lebanon analysts said 
december gold futures jumped to 419 a troy ounce on the 
commodity exchange in new york up 890 from thursdays close 
investors traditionally turn to gold as a safe haven during 
international turmoil because it is considered immune from the 
economic volatility such as higher inflation that may accompany 
the unrest 
gold futures later lost about half of their early gains and bond 
prices bounced back 
analysts said bond prices also continued to be influenced by 
government reports this week that showed the economy is slowing 
suggesting inflation is under control and that the federal reserve

in the first test of a new tougher trade law 
the reagan administration on friday rejected a request from us 
rice farmers that it launch an investigation into charges that the 
japanese government is unfairly blocking rice imports into that 
country 
the announcement by us trade representative clayton yeutter 
came as something of a surprise because supporters of the petition 
were hoping the pressure of presidential politics would force a 
different outcome 
yeutter called japans barriers against rice imports 
intolerable but he said he believed the matter could be better 
handled through a new round of trade negotiations now being carried 
out under the 97nation general agreement on tariffs and trade or 
gatt rather than in direct confrontation 
the administration had rejected a similar petition in 1986 
because it wanted to give tokyo time to negotiate changes in its ban 
on rice imports 
we are shocked and dismayed that ambassador yeutter once again 
would reject the us rice industrys request said j stephen 
gabbert president of the rice millers association which had filed 
the petition along with the rice council for market development a 
growers group 
the petition filed sept 14 is the first major case under the 
new omnibus trade act which president reagan signed into law in 
august the new law which took three years to get through congress 
makes it harder for the administration to avoid taking action on 
complaints alleging unfair trade 
two of the biggest election battlegrounds california and texas 
are ricegrowing states and backers of the petition believed the 
administration would not run the risk of appearing weak on trade by 
rejecting the petition 
both republican presidential nominee george bush and democratic 
candidate michael dukakis have voiced support for the rice 
industrys position 
in california last month bush said he would urge yeutter to 
approve the complaint so we can maintain the pressure against 
barriers to our exports around the world 
yeutter a strong supporter of bush who has campaigned for the 
republican ticket said he had listened to bush but believed other 
factors outweighed the arguments in favor of launching an 
investigation 
in a second trade matter yeutter announced successful resolution 
of negotiations with the government of south korea over charges that 
country was unfairly keeping american films out of south korean 
theaters 
the negotiations were launched after the motion picture 
assocation of america filed a complaint yeutter said us and south 
korean negotiators had successfully cleared up all matters of 
dispute 
on the rice issue yeutter said he believed that an unfairtrade 
investigation against japan which could have resulted in the united 
states slapping retaliatory tariffs on japanese goods would have 
been counterproductive to us goals in the current round of world 
trade negotiations 
this round of gatt talks known as the uruguay round is coming 
to a critical review session in early december in montreal 
yeutter said he would be looking for support from japan on the 
us goal of eliminating all farm subsidies by the year 2000 he 
said the trade ministers will also negotiate in montreal shortterm 
subsidy reductions which could include rice 
yeutter said if japan does not demonstrate its commitment to open 
up its markets to us farm products during the montreal talks he 
would welcome a refiling of the rice petition he promised he would 
rule on the issue before the reagan administration leaves office on 
jan 20 
but rep vic fazio dcalif whose district includes some of the 
biggest rice farms in the united states said the decision proved 
officials in the reagan administration are patsies when it comes 
to doing battle against even blatantly illegal trade barriers 
californias senators democrat alan cranston and republican pete 
wilson also expressed dismay this refusal by the us to take 
direct action under our new tougher trade law could well serve to 
reaffirm the practice of protectionism by the japanese and resound 
negatively throughout the us economy said wilson who is in a 
tight reelection race 
but mitsugu horiuchi president of japans central union of 
agricultural cooperatives said in a statement i feel certain 
that this decision was based on the broader need for economic and 
political friendship between the united states and japan and on the 
recognition that agricultural trade between the united states and 
japan is the largest amd most stable in the world 
the rice issue has received a large amount of attention in japan 
where rice farmers remain a potent political force the japanese 
government permits only a small amount of rice imports into the 
country and is committed to supporting the domestic industry even 
though it is inefficient 
as a result japanese consumers pay from six to 10 times the 
world price of rice a staple of the japanese diet 
tokyo maintains that it is essential for the country to protect 
its domestic industry because rice which has been grown in japan 
for more than 2000 years carries almost a mystical significance to 
the japanese people 
japanese ambassador nobuo matsunaga last month delivered a long 
position paper to us officials explaining the critical position 
rice plays in japanese society 
the japanese parliament passed a resolution last month declaring 
rice closely related to the japanese culture which helps to 
maintain and develop the wholesomeness of the japanese society 
japanese rice farmers have even sought to bring emperor hirohito 
into the dispute contending that an adverse decision would be an 
insult to the ailing monarch
