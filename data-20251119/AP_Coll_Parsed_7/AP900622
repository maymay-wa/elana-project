she noticed a large bison nearby and slightly behind her the 
animal appeared to be grazing and ambling along slowly towards her 
and he didnt look mean kimball recalled

diplomats business leaders and celebrities 
dropped all pretense of being jaded and demonstrated their 
excitement friday over nelson mandela who later was the star 
attraction at a celebrity fundraiser 
as the antiapartheid leader strode to the podium in the 
vaulted greencarpeted general assembly hall at the united 
nations several hundred delegates and dignitaries jumped to their 
feet to cheer him 
earlier he charmed about 150 top businesspeople at the world 
trade center where he expressed interest in us companies and 
foundations investing in a postapartheid south africa 
there was a crackling excitement in the audience said 
richard leone chairman of the port authority of new york and new 
jersey ive spent a long time on wall street and you dont 
usually see that in an audience of this type it was quite an 
exciting thing 
after the meeting at the skyscraper in lower manhattan mandela 
still basking in the glow of euphoric crowds in harlem and yankee 
stadium a night earlier told reporters the reception has been 
beyond my wildest dreams 
the un speech came on the third day of mandelas trip to the 
united states and his last full day in new york where he struck 
deep emotional and political chords among the hundreds of thousands 
who turned out to see him 
calling apartheid a crime against humanity mandela said 
the sanctions that have been imposed by the united nations and by 
individual governments should remain in place 
the un general assembly has long been a leader in the battle 
against apartheid south africa a un member was ousted from the 
general assembly in 1974 and was not represented when mandela spoke 
security has been extremely heavy in new york for the visit 
in johannesburg south africa a newspaper reported friday that 
police arrested 11 whites in connection with a rightwing plot to 
assassinate mandela president fw de klerk and others 
authorities confirmed the arrests and said all were later 
released 
the afrikaanslanguage weekly vryeweekblad said that under the 
plan mandela would have been shot at johannesburgs jan smuts 
airport when he returned home july 18 
mandela 71 finished the new york leg of his visit with a pair 
of fundraisers one at the home of movie executive arthur krim 
the second at actor robert de niros film production headquarters 
the friday night parties were expected to generate more than 1 
million for the african national congress 
arriving at de niros party to cheers from the 200 or so 
spectators behind police barricades were denzel washington eddie 
murphy bette midler spike lee robin williams joe piscopo and 
lou diamond phillips among others madonna was among those 
expected to attend but by the time the event started she hadnt 
been spotted by reporters outside the event which was closed to 
the media 
the stars entered the restaurant under a banner reading 
artists united against apartheid 
were with him said little steven van zandt well do 
everything he wants us to do were working for the south african 
people 
mandela left after about an hour to cheers from the hundreds of 
people who waited outside in the rain 
lee reported nelson gave an inspiring speech he stressed 
that we should stay committed to the cultural boycott 
mandelas wife winnie taped an interview with phil donahue 
that was televised in some areas friday and will be broadcast 
elsewhere on monday she reiterated that she would be the first to 
resort to warfare if negotiations with the white rulers of south 
africa break down 
mandela started his day with an early morning walk through a 
park adjacent to mayor david dinkins residence where he is 
staying 
during his thursday stroll mandela a former amateur boxer 
asked a police chief about where tyson lives on friday he met the 
former heavyweight champion before the un ceremonies 
the 6foot4 mandela towered over tyson who measures 5 feet 10 
inches as the two locked in a handshake and chatted for about a 
minute they smiled broadly 
hes a fighter in all aspects tyson said later truly he 
is fighting the greatest fight not only for himself but for all 
human rights 
mandelas tour was being used to cement antiapartheid actions 
as well as raise funds for the anc of which mandela is deputy 
president he was released from a south african jail four months 
ago after serving 27 years for his activities on the ancs behalf 
the new york visit is expected to generate some 15 million 
said suzanne dubose one of the mayors financial advisers who is 
handling fundraising chores here 
the city was still totaling how much of a strain mandelas visit 
would put on its already tight budget police overtime alone was 
expected to cost 2 million but dinkins has said he expects the 
state department to pay that bill 
mandela is scheduled to leave for boston early saturday

a candidate who appeared to have won the 
democratic primary for governor by a 32vote margin asked the state 
supreme court on friday to block plans for a second recount of the 
ballots 
candidate ben nelson asked the high court to certify him as his 
partys candidate to challenge republican incumbent kay orr in 
november 
unofficial figures from recounts in the states 93 counties 
showed nelson with a 32vote lead over bill hoppner in the may 15 
primary 
earlier this week the state board of canvassers said there 
should be a further recount of some ballots in 23 counties 
on friday nelsons attorneys asked the high court to take 
jurisdiction from district court and order the state board of 
canvassers to certify that nelson won they argued that the canvass 
board failed to comply with its legal duty and certify the election 
results submitted by the counties 
hoppner was on a fishing trip in wyoming on friday and 
unavailable for comment 
if the sevenmember supreme court agreed to nelsons request it 
would have to meet on or before the close of business monday to 
decide the question 
the first recount was automatic because the contest was so 
close the second partial recount sought by the state canvassing 
board was expected to begin early next week

lawmakers who defeated a proposed 
constitutional amendment against burning the american flag are 
bracing for a fierce fight on the campaign trail but say they sense 
a change of heart among many voters 
something that folks loathe almost as much as flag burners is 
politicians who demagogue who wrap themselves in the flag for some 
partisan votes rep ben jones dga said after the measure 
failed to gain the necessary twothirds majority thursday 
democratic lawmakers who voted against it told reporters they 
detected a change among voters and said their mail is no longer 
running so heavily in favor of the amendment 
the house voted 254177 for the measure which president bush 
had been pressing since june 11 when the supreme court threw out 
the 1989 flag protection act as unconstitutional 
however the margin fell 34 votes short of the twothirds needed 
for approval of the amendment which would pave the way for the 
federal government and the states to ban burning or other 
desecration of the american flag 
republicans voted 15917 in favor of the amendment while 
democrats were 16095 against 
the senate remains committed to vote on the amendment before 
leaving on a fourth of july recess next week but the house action 
appeared to render that virtually meaningless and speaker thomas 
s foley dwash said there was no chance that the house would 
return to the issue this year 
foley and other democratic leaders campaigned hard against the 
measure 
the house action followed a day of emotional debate in which 
more than 100 lawmakers paraded to the microphone to either praise 
the amendment as protection for a national symbol and condemn it as 
an attack on the bill of rights 
minority whip newt gingrich rga immediately renewed his 
warning of earlier in the week that the battle will now move to the 
campaign trail 
i am absolutely confident that in those districts where the 
members values are clearly at variance with his district where 
you dont have a hollywoodgreenwich villagesan francisco kind of 
value structure that this will be a significant issue in debates 
in october as candidates stand side by side gingrich told 
reporters 
minority leader robert h michel rill a chief sponsor of the 
amendment did not attend gingrichs news conference but said in 
debate that the issue was not a partisan one 
gingrich said he doubted if the flagburning issue would be 
decisive in any campaigns but that in races where there is a 
fight over values it will be one more piece of evidence 
how can it avoid being a big political issue he said it 
is a legitimate cultural values issue 
critics portrayed their decision as a stand in favor of freedom 
of speech despite warnings from gingrich that their vote would be 
used to inflame passions among americans who grow emotional at the 
sight of a burning flag 
rep david skaggs dcolo said after the vote that there 
were many individual acts of political courage on the floor 
men and women have literally risked their political future on 
behalf of the constitution and the bill of rights he said 
rep don edwards dcalif a leading critic of the amendment 
contended that despite recent public opinion polls that indicated 
proamendment sentiment voters are undergoing a change over heart 
over the issue 
edwards said his mail was running as much as 301 against his 
position a year ago but now is 501 in favor the american people 
are actually moving toward understanding better what they have in 
the bill of rights every day he said 
because he opposes the amendment jones said his election 
opponent is gleefully using it but he said it also seems to 
me that i represent a district which is independent and thoughtful 
and will make its decision in november based on a broad range of 
considerations and a number of issues 
after the vote on the amendment the house rejected 236179 a 
narrowly drawn statute to punish people who burn flags to promote 
violence or who burn flags on federal property or flags belonging 
to the federal government 
republicans voted overwhelmingly against it after gop leaders 
called it a political fig leaf to protect democrats who opposed 
the amendment 
on the house floor michel said there was not a single phrase 
in our amendment not a single word suggesting this amendment 
would or could lead to censorship of unpopular ideas by the 
government 
edwards however asked if the house would tell visiting 
south african black leader nelson mandela next week that weve 
had enough of unlimited free speech in this country we dont trust 
free speech anymore and last week we voted to cut back on it

a plan to boost funding for poor and 
middleincome schools at the expense of the wealthiest schools won 
final approval thursday in the state assembly 
the action came just two weeks after the state supreme court 
ruled the system of school funding discriminated against children 
in poor districts new jerseys system dependent on the property 
tax is among a dozen that have been overturned by courts in recent 
years 
the assembly vote on the proposal by gov jim florio on thursday 
morning followed allnight haggling and debate the assembly also 
approved florios proposal for 28 billion in tax increases 
including income tax hikes for residents who make 35000 a year or 
more and raises in sales oil and tobacco taxes 
the bills are now before florio who is expected to sign them 
next week 
the controversial school funding bill cleared the assembly 
4133 with just enough votes for passage the state senate passed 
the school funding plan and income and sales tax increases about 15 
hours earlier with the bare minimum 21 votes all cast by democrats 
higher income taxes will pump 11 billion more in state aid to 
public schools largely to poor and middleincome districts aid 
will be sharply cut or eliminated to the wealthiest 
the powerful teachers lobby bitterly opposed the school funding 
bill because it requires some wealthy districts to pay for pension 
costs the teachers representatives contend that shifting that cost 
from the state endangers teachers financial security 
the state supreme court found the current school funding system 
unconstitutional ordered that it be changed by the 199192 school 
year as in other states schools in welltodo areas were better 
funded because local governments were able to collect more in 
property taxes 
other states where courts have ordered changes in school funding 
are kentucky kansas wisconsin california connecticut 
washington west virginia wyoming arkansas and montana 
the 30 poorest school districts in the state would receive the 
bulk of the new state aid and about 350 suburban and rural 
districts would also see more state money at the same time aid to 
the 250 wealthiest districts would be reduced or abolished by 1995 
republicans bitterly opposed all the proposals they charged the 
school aid plan will decrease aid and raise property taxes in 
middle class communities they represent 
we dont need to penalize one set of school districts in order 
to benefit another said assemblyman robert littell rsussex 
but democrats said it was time to act before another generation 
of youngsters from poor urban communities is lost they said that 
while some districts will lose aid there will be more state aid 
for 73 percent of new jerseys schoolchildren 
this bill guarantees every child in this state will have a 
quality education said assembly speaker joseph doria dhudson 
florio said he would take the package to the public explaining 
its benefits to propertytax payers and schoolchildren 
this will not be a difficult thing for us to sell he said

with the citys homicide rate up nearly 60 percent 
during last year officials hope beefedup patrols neighborhood 
youth programs and an antigang task force can stem the violence of 
summer 
but with homicide rates on the rise in big cities like new york 
and dallas no one is quite sure how to reduce the drugrelated 
gunplay and gang warfare on the streets as summer begins 
its troubling said jim jordan spokesman for the boston 
police department which reported 74 homicides so far this year 
compared with 51 from january to july 1 of 1989 
in boston that means steppedup police patrols in highcrime 
areas like roxbury and dorchester and the vigilance of a antigang 
task force that has made 269 arrests of gang members since its 
formation in march 
the citys safe neighborhoods plan targets youth in the 
innercity by offering them hundreds of options to stay off the 
streets 
city officials business and community leaders hope to guarantee 
a summer job to every teenager who wants one they also have 
scheduled hundreds of activities ranging from cookouts to 
neighborhood cleanups 
more important is the citys decision to maintain the program 
yearround said safe neighborhoods director ted landsmark 
violence went up last fall when folks went back to school so 
we learned we have to keep it going all year landsmark said 
we know itll help during the summer and for the rest of the 
year too 
federal drug czar william bennett last week said antidrug 
efforts have caused a shortage of cocaine that could lead to 
violence there will be the same number of dogs fighting over a 
smaller number of bones bennett said 
in texas more than 150 elected dallasarea officials including 
the mayor and chief of police meet friday to map an anticrime 
strategy for the summer 
dallas police business and community leaders also instituted 
project city a program aimed at providing recreation and 
employment for youth in the mostly black and hispanic oak cliff 
area 
historically we see a 10 to 15 percent increase in crime in 
the summer and we like to do something about it beforehand said 
police sgt jim chandler the homicide rate in dallas is up 16 
percent over last year 
chicago has added 50 officers to the police anticrime unit for 
the summer and has beefed up the narcotics unit 
we can deal with the enforcement part but the jails are 
overcrowded and people get out faster said tina vicina a 
chicago police spokeswoman she said the 375 reported homicides in 
chicago is nearly even with last years rate but she said it 
always gets worse in the summer 
in new york where the homicide rate is up 29 percent over last 
year police arent planning anything special for this summer 
its not good said new york police det joseph mcconville 
we need more cops but we got budgetary restraints well just be 
deploying officers where we think theyre needed 
in los angeles where 412 homicides were reported as of june 14 
compared with 386 for the same time last year the police 
department has announced no specific plans for the summer said 
officer don lawrence

the durian is back in season and hawkers are 
thinking up special names and twisting arms to sell a bumper crop 
of the sweet but malodorous fruit 
calling the spiky green globe smelly does it injustice it 
stinks 
among the printable descriptions one says it evokes rich 
brimstone musk whispering of depravity and monthold eggs durian 
is to fruit what limburger is to cheese and pornography is to 
literature 
the stench allows no indifference you love it or you leave the 
neighborhood 
no junk food the muchloved muchhated durian is high in 
protein carbohydrates and vitamins b and c experts say it thrives 
in soil with a high sulfur content which doubtless contributes to 
its pungent odor 
the telltale aroma now permeates sections of singapore 
malaysia thailand indonesia and the philippines durians ripen 
twice a year in decemberjanuary and junejuly 
they vary widely but many are about eight inches long and seven 
inches wide durians weigh about 6 pounds the outer rind bristles 
with tough thorns or duri which protect a creamy yelloworange 
pulp 
the fruit is traditionally eaten raw after careful appraisal and 
sharp bargaining by purists who pride themselves on picking out 
just the right one 
that was more difficult this year as hardsell tactics were used 
by some singapore vendors others tried to take the homely durian 
upmarket with designer labels 
the police warned that strongarm tactics would not be tolerated 
after several shoppers complained they were intimidated by 
aggressive fruit vendors durians are sold from outdoor stalls that 
have a carnival atmosphere at night at the peak of the season 
the best the best the very best from malaysia one hawker 
chanted with the aplomb of a determined auctioneer 
other merchants try to turn top grade durians into something 
special costlier anyway with names such as lion den and tiger 
hill and xo xo is on the label of some expensive cognacs 
xo sounds expensive like something with class we want to 
impress people said ben teo manager of seh sen fruits imported 
from neighboring malaysia xo boasts smoother texture and thicker 
pulp teo said 
while ordinary durians cost from 136 to 272 each an xo 
costs about 9 a pound 
the bigger king xo fetches more than 27 a pound the king has 
smaller seeds than the ordinary xo and retains its smell longer 
teo said 
the powerful aroma is the perfume of prosperity for growers and 
others in the trade wholesale prices vary widely according to 
freshness weight shape and where they were grown a market that 
seems as delicately balanced as wall street 
related botanically to hibiscus hollyhock cotton and kapok 
durian is native to malaysia and has been cultivated for centuries 
unlike the shorter thai plantation version trees in malaysia and 
elsewhere are too lofty to harvest and the fruit crashes to the 
ground when it is ripe 
fermentation that starts the moment it drops can change the 
flavor perceptibly within hours the fruit spoils within a week and 
few will eat durian more than three days after they fall 
thailand is the biggest commercial grower and old asia hands 
rate thai durians as tops in consistency and flavor the most 
malodorous seem to be grown in the philippines 
malaysian devotees regard it as a passion fruit capable of 
stirring deep emotions when the durians come down the sarongs go 
up according to local legend

president bushs suspension of talks with 
the plo will strengthen the hand of palestinian militants and 
hardline arab states who oppose yasser arafats peace effort it 
also will intensify growing antiamerican sentiment 
bushs decision wednesday to freeze the 18monthold talks 
rather than break them off completely has left the door open for 
contacts to resume 
but the breakdown raises the prospects of a resumption of 
widescale terrorism at a time when passions in the middle east are 
flaring and moderate leaders are warning that a new arabisraeli 
conflict may be looming 
bush suspended the talks because arafat refused to condemn an 
abortive guerrilla attack on israel 
the lowlevel dialogue began in december 1988 when the united 
states ended a 13year boycott following arafats renunciation of 
terrorism and recognition of israels right to exist it was seen 
as a breakthrough in the tortuous middle east peace process 
but palestinian leaders have become increasingly disillusioned 
with washingtons inability to prod israel into peace talks with 
the palestine liberation organization 
well not shed any tears over the us decision arafats 
top lieutenant salah khalaf said in tunis the dialogue 
produced no positive results 
we recognized israel we did everything the americans asked 
and israel didnt give an inch khalaf said 
the prospect of talking directly to the americans may have 
been the carrot that prompted arafat to renounce terrorism and 
explicitly recognize israel but the dialogue or rather the 
threat to break it off has come to be seen by many palestinians 
and not all of them radicals as a stick brandished by the united 
states to extract ever greater concessions from the plo without 
offering anything in return veteran analyst charles snow wrote 
in the middle east economic survey a few days ago 
the plo leadership has not said what it will do but arafats 
peace initiative looks dead in the water along with the bush 
administrations effort to mediate a peace settlement 
saeed kamel the top plo official in cairo said thursday the 
palestinian leadership is currently considering options to press 
forward toward peace this will be unveiled in the coming weeks 
he refused to elaborate but his statement indicated arafat is 
not about to reverse course and opt for allout violence 
a government official in cairo which has mediated between 
israel and the united states said egypt will support arafat and 
his moderate policy and curb the palestinian militants 
arafat said recently that if his peace effort failed he would 
call a meeting of the palestine national council the palestinians 
parliamentinexile submit his resignation as plo chairman and say 
i am returning your mandate 
kamels statement appeared to indicate this point has not been 
reached 
however it is unlikely that arafat will bow to us demands 
that he discipline mohammad abass maverick leader of the palestine 
liberation front for launching the may 30 attack and dismiss him 
from the plos ruling executive committee 
arafat insists that only the palestine national council can 
dismiss abass from the plos executive committee 
with the dialogue suspended arafat may feel even less inclined 
to punish abass whose small faction is part of the plo if he did 
crack down on abass he risks alienating the plos radicals and 
triggering widespread defections 
there has been no indication so far that arafat will respond to 
the us decision by unleashing his guerrillas against israel again 
but there is always the risk that the militants will take 
matters into their own hands with the dialogue on the rocks they 
no longer believe there is anything to lose 
despite the efforts of leaders like king fahd of saudi arabia 
and president hosni mubarak of egypt moderation is in short supply 
in the arab world these days 
antiamerican feeling is growing because of what many arabs see 
as washingtons political military and economic support for israel 
a longtime moderate figure in jordan former foreign minister 
taher masri said recently the americans are too cowardly to do 
anything 
the state department on thursday urged americans traveling to 
the middle east and elsewhere to exercise extra caution 
the arabs also blame the americans for doing nothing to prevent 
a wave of immigration to israel by soviet jews israeli officials 
expect 150000 by the end of the year and say up to 1 million will 
seek to settle in the jewish state in the next few years 
the arabs fear many will settle in the occupied west bank and 
gaza land proclaimed an independent palestinian state pushing out 
large numbers of palestinians 
the plo is losing support in the occupied zones to the extremist 
islamic fundamentalists of the gazabased hamas group who advocate 
an allout struggle against israel 
arafats credibility in the occupied territories where 
palestinians have been waging an uprising for the last 30 months 
is likely to be eroded further because of his failure to achieve a 
political breakthrough the prospect of that is now more remote 
than ever 
khalaf warned last month that the plo leaders run the risk of 
becoming generals without troops 
arafats critics stress that the uprising has neither persuaded 
the israelis to relinquish the west bank and gaza nor persuaded 
them to consider peace talks with the plo 
in this climate of uncertainty and frustration coupled with a 
buildup of longrange missiles and weapons of mass destruction 
what happens in the next few weeks will be crucial

new aids treatments emerging from the national 
institutes of health promise to be as good as existing treatments 
but without many of the severe side effects new studies show 
existing treatments revolving around the drug azt may soon be 
replaced by combinations of drugs that can kill the aids virus 
without the damage to the bloodproducing bone marrow often caused 
by azt researchers said thursday at the sixth international 
conference on aids 
the worlds largest meeting on aids continued to be the target 
of demonstrations several hundred demonstrators marched to city 
hall and about 50 were arrested when they blocked traffic in a 
nearby intersection 
an aidsinfected doctor who delivered a moving talk to the 
conference on discrimination against aids patients said that the 
johns hopkins university medical school had taken the unusual step 
of seeking a court injunction to bar his speech 
dr hacib aoun who contracted aids from a patients blood in 
1983 while in training at hopkins was forced to sue hopkins to get 
medical coverage he said 
the 1987 settlement of the suit was kept secret and a hopkins 
spokeswoman said the institution was trying to be sure aoun did not 
violate that secrecy 
the following were among the meetings highlights 
tests by dr gary richwald and colleagues at ucla of 246 
prostitutes in a legal nevada brothel found that none had acquired 
an aids infection since 1986 that was the year the state made use 
of condoms mandatory in its 35 legal brothels 
along about 1985 when the aids epidemic really hit and was a 
news item i really serious thought that perhaps the party was 
over said russell reade coowner of the chicken ranch in 
pahrump nev i was pleasantly surprised that business 
increased 
ten years into the aids epidemic some gay men are relapsing 
into unsafe sexual practices that could lead to an even larger 
second wave of deadly infection researchers said 
maggie reinfeld of the gay mens health crisis in new york city 
said the organization has established an educational and 
advertising campaign to combat that safer sex gets a lot tougher 
when you have to live with it your whole life she said 
more than 1 million african children who are not infected with 
the aids virus have aidsinfected mothers and are likely to become 
orphans said eunice kiereini of the world health organization 
fifty percent of africas aids cases are in women she said 
aouns speech about aids discrimination included the charge that 
johns hopkins had discriminated against him by failing to renew his 
contract and trying to deny him health benefits he did not mention 
the institution by name however 
paul rosenberg vice president and general counsel for the johns 
hopkins medical school and hospital in baltimore said we did in 
fact seek guidance of a court with respect to dr aouns speech 
he responded to aouns charges through a statement released by a 
hopkins spokeswoman 
hopkins also contacted the conferences program director to try 
to get an advance copy of aouns speech the program director dr 
robert wachter of the university of california san francisco 
wrote back to hopkins to say that he didnt have a copy 
it wasnt to prevent him from speaking rosenberg said we 
actually wanted to see his speech 
the studies of new aids treatments mostly dealt with drugs of 
the same class as azt such as one called ddi and another called 
ddc 
we clearly need alternatives to azt said dr thomas merigan 
of stanford university he was one of six researchers who described 
experiments with the new drugs he noted that patients react 
differently to the drugs and said that ddc for example would be 
especially useful for patients who have trouble with ddi or azt 
while studies using combinations of the drugs look promising it 
is too early yet to begin widespread use of such combination 
treatments the researchers said 
continuing studies with azt now suggest that the drug is best if 
given as soon as possible after diagnosis of infection with the 
aids virus said dr margaret fischl of the university of miami 
she presented the strongest evidence yet that use of azt early 
in infection can significantly slow development of lifethreatening 
illness

president patricio aylwin says he would 
allow the trial and punishment of any military officer including 
expresident augusto pinochet on human rights abuse charges if the 
courts find legal grounds 
the decisions of the courts will be complied with aylwin 
told a news conference thursday on his 100th day in office 
there has been speculation the government will eventually decree 
a pardon or amnesty aylwins statements on thursday appeared to 
rule that out although he said often justice is out of reach 
because of the time that has elapsed 
since chiles return to democracy authorities have found two 
mass graves believed used by the army after a 1973 coup led by gen 
pinochet in all 23 bodies were unearthed but 700 suspected 
leftists who disappeared during military rule remain missing 
aylwin who replaced pinochet in march after winning free 
elections said he and his defense minister asked top military 
authorities for information on any other hidden graves 
the answer i received is that there is willingness to 
cooperate on the matter but that the high commands dont know 
where these places really are he said 
among the missing were more than 100 people summarily executed 
by special militaryled tribunals after the coup according to 
human rights organizations the victims families were notified of 
the executions but the bodies were not handed over most of the 
other missing people also were believed to have been in military or 
police custody 
aylwin has said he plans to pursue a reconciliation of civilians 
and the military and that a special investigation launched by his 
administration into human rights abuse would conclude with a time 
for forgiveness 
pinochet led a september 1973 military takeover that toppled an 
elected leftist government 
after 16 years of authoritarian leadership on march 11 he 
handed over the presidency but remained commander of the 
60000member army a constitutional clause bars aylwin from 
replacing him 
while in power pinochet decreed an amnesty for atrocities 
committed from the coup through march 1978 
aylwin questioned the validity of the decree citing 
international treaties that require chile to respect human rights 
he said some jurists believe the treaties supercede any amnesties 
and can be applied retroactively 
aylwin also took issue with a recent army declaration that 
called the atrocities the inevitable result of an internal war 
between the armed forces and militant leftists 
within three days of the takeover aylwin said they the 
military had the country under control they cant cite a state of 
war to justify excesses abuse and human rights violations 
even in states of war some basic rules have to be 
respected he said 
despite clashes between the military and the government on the 
human rights issue aylwin categorically rejected the possibility 
of a coup 
he said the military have made clear their loyal desire to 
obey the constitution and the law while his government plans to 
respect the institution of the armed forces 
he said he was trying to build as frank and as positive a 
relationship as possible with pinochet

racially motivated melee among 100 prisoners thursday wounding 16 
inmates officials said 
the guards at the minimumsecurity cimarron unit at arizona 
state prison fired shotguns into the ground after a warning shot 
and tear gas failed to end the disturbance said corrections

pellets he said 
eight of the injured were treated at area hospitals and eight 
others were treated at the prison dominiak said he was unable to 
say how badly they were hurt no guards were injured 
the incident started about 5 pm with rock throwing between 
blacks and hispanics in a crowd of about 100 inmates the spokesman 
said white inmates joined in siding with the hispanics and guards 
moved in to try to break up the fight 
dominiak said a guard lieutenant ordered a shot fired into the 
air and then tear gas fired into the crowd of fighting inmates but 
both measures failed to stop the fight 
he said guards fired into the crowd of inmates only after the 
group began to advance in what he described as a threatening 
way toward the guards 
part of the unit was locked down and guards late thursday were 
working to return all prisoners to their cells dominiak said

declaring the cold war over a house committee 
is pushing a 158 billion foreign aid bill that begins shifting 
the emphasis in americas help from military toward more economic 
aid 
the west has won the cold war and we have a right to say 
so the appropriations committee trumpeted in its report on the 
1991 aid measure approved thursday on a voice vote 
the march toward democracy and free markets in eastern europe 
and elsewhere brings congress face to face with the 
responsibility to reshape our foreign assistance budget the 
democraticrun committee said harshly criticizing president bush 
for drafting a sleepwalkers budget 
rep david obey dwis foreign aid subcommittee chairman 
called bushs request for 5 billion in military aid an increase 
of 300 million over the current level particularly quaint 
given the changes in the world instead the panel approved just 
over 46 billion in military aid to friends and allies around the 
globe 
obey mapped out a fiveyear agenda for changing the emphasis of 
us aid beginning this year with a shift of 400 million from 
military aid into programs for refugees children and economic 
development for africa latin america and eastern europe 
he had sought even deeper cuts but was forced to add back 144 
million to the military aid account to buy at least the temporary 
support of the administration and republican lawmakers when the 
bill goes to the full house next week 
there will be plenty of other fights on the bill including 
battles over us aid to el salvador to cambodian rebels and to 
international population control agencies the bill remains subject 
to further change when it goes to the senate 
on the most difficult issue el salvador the bill would 
withhold half of next years expected 85 million in military aid 
the fate of the money would depend on progress in peace talks 
between the government and leftist rebels who have waged a 10year 
civil war 
if the fmln rebels were to mount a major military offensive or 
abandon peace discussions the governments military aid would be 
restored if the salvadoran government were to take such action it 
would lose the remaining half of its aid 
the assistant secretary of state for the western hemisphere 
bernard aronson met late thursday with key lawmakers of both 
parties to begin forging a compromise bipartisan policy toward el 
salvador that could be substituted for that part of the bill 
aronson brought a counterproposal to the meeting calling for 
similar conditions on the us aid money but restricting a smaller 
portion of it perhaps 25 to 30 percent democrats however were 
coming under pressure from liberal members to hold the line and 
make no concessions to the administration 
to win gop support for the package obey also agreed to provide 
50 million for the world bank just less than half of what bush 
had asked obey has fought what he sees as the practice of giving 
money to international lenders that ends up going to bail out large 
commercial banks from loans made to third world countries 
and in another concession to the white house the appropriations 
committee agreed to raise aid ceilings for three countries that 
host us military bases 
turkey would get 430 million up 30 million from the earlier 
version of the bill greece would be increased from 280 million to 
301 million and portugal would go from 90 million to 95 
million all remained substantially below currentyear levels 
another fight loomed over a section barring any aid to the 
noncommunist resistance coalition in cambodia that includes the 
khmer rouge the group believed to have massacred about 1 million 
people when it ruled cambodia in the 1970s 
about 7 million a year in us humanitarian aid now flows to 
the resistance coalition which is fighting the 
vietnameseinstalled government of cambodia the united states 
supports the faction of prince norodom sihanouk and provides aid 
even though some of it finds its way to the khmer rouge the 
militarily strongest part of the coalition

in 1910 it was an ordinary summer event in 
the preparation of dinner on the farm the noon meal for a 
chicken to be caught its neck wrung and then dressed cut up and 
plunked in the frying pan 
today descendants of the 1910 family if they still are 
farmers shop at supermarkets often for the same convenient items 
enjoyed by city families 
there is still a significant amount of home butchering 
vegetable growing and other use of farmgrown products but not 
like it was when automobiles and airplanes were new when horses 
and musclepower were the prime movers 
a new report by the agriculture department tells in stark 
unemotional numbers what has happened 
for example in 1910 the estimated value of home 
consumption by farm families items mostly food that are 
produced themselves was 127 billion in 1988 the value of 
those items was 810 million 
the figures are not adjusted for inflation so a few more 
comparisons may help and keep in mind that the number of farmers 
has dropped sharply in the past 80 years 
according to usda records there were 32 million people living 
on 636 million farms in 1910 the 1988 tally was 495 million 
people living on fewer than 22 million farms 
in 1910 farmers sold about 578 billion worth of products in 
other words the value of cash marketings that year was only 
45 times as great as the 127 billion value of home consumption 
but in 1988 cash marketings totaled more than 1514 billion 
or nearly 187 times larger than home consumption reported at 810 
million 
there has been a decrease in the number of farm families and 
theres more prepared food that people can buy outside the farm 
said cheryl d johnson of the departments economic research 
service the reports author 
at the same time she said thursday in a telephone interview 
farm production has increased while total input items used by 
farmers to produce crops and livestock has generally declined 
in other words farmers today are actually producing more with 
less than they were before world war i johnson said 
the reports section on productivity used 1977 as a base year 
for comparison in 1910 the output of crops was 42 percent of the 
base although 1988 was a drought year of severely damaged crops 
production was still 92 percent the record was 118 percent in 1985 
livestock production in 1910 was 39 percent compared with 115 
percent in 1988 the record high 
on the input side farmers purchased only 32 percent of the 
items needed to produce in 1910 compared with the 1977 base year 
of 100 percent while their nonpurchased items were reported 
at 175 percent 
in 1988 farmers purchased 92 percent of what they bought in 
1977 reflecting the downturn in the farm economy since the late 
1970s and early 1980s when the purchased inputs peaked 
nonpurchased inputs in 1988 were reported at 78 percent of the 
1977 base representing a part of the general downturn since the 
early 1930s a period when mechanization chemicals hybrid seeds 
and scores of other items finally crowded out the homespun 
environment of the american farmer 
the peak year for the use of nonpurchased items incidentally 
was 1920 when those represented 198 percent of the 1977 base year 
in 1932 those still totaled 191 percent but dropped rapidly after 
that

james cason who was rejected last year by the 
senate for a top job in the agriculture department is working as 
deputy manager of the federal crop insurance corp 
cason 35 asked the white house last november to withdraw his 
nomination as assistant secretary for natural resources and the 
environment 
casons withdrawal effectively ended an eightmonth battle 
between president bush and environmentalists who were supported by 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee 
opposition was led by the sierra club national wildlife 
federation wilderness society league of conservation voters and 
national audubon society 
the groups alleged casons record in several top interior 
department positions during the reagan administration showed 
favoritism toward development of public lands despite 
environmental concerns 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who cleared cason for the 
new 79200ayear usda job had strongly supported the nomination 
and had characterized the opposition as both misguided and 
unfair 
the federal crop insurance corp which provides subsidized 
insurance to farmers to help protect them from losses due to 
drought and other natural disasters said thursday that cason 
joined the agency on may 6

in this day and age when countries argue less 
and cooperate more when armies are trimmed and eastwest divisions 
erased the arabisraeli conflict stands out as an anomaly 
the prospects for a settlement are at another low point some 
people are talking openly about the possibility of yet another war 
in the region it is the only major conflict in the world in which 
there is no serious peace process under way 
palestinians have an understandable desire to have a nation of 
their own israelis have an equally understandable yearning to be 
free from external threat palestinians feel oppressed israelis 
feel insecure 
mistrust is everywhere the fledgling us dialogue with the 
palestine liberation organization has lapsed while still in its 
infancy victim of an abortive terrorist raid near tel aviv that 
the plo leadership refused to repudiate 
president bushs decision to scuttle the dialogue won plaudits 
in jerusalem still the usisraeli dialogue is about as 
corrosive now as it has been at any time since the early carter 
years 
the contrast with the situation elsewhere on the globe could not 
be greater perhaps for the first time the soviet union has a 
leader almost universally regarded as a man of peace there is now 
even talk of western economic aid for the kremlin 
in europe its doubtful that the people of that continent have 
ever gotten along better than they do now the main agenda item 
this week is german reunification secretary of state james a 
baker iii is in berlin for those discussions 
in the post world war ii era baker more than any of his 
predecessors has had the luxury of being able to reconcile old 
conflicts as opposed to confronting new ones consider the remark a 
generation ago of secretary of state dean rusk when im asleep 
twothirds of the rest of the world is awake stirring up trouble 
baker sleeps easier than rusk did 
just this past monday baker concluded a visit to guatemala 
where five central american presidents talked about integrating 
their economies it was the first time these presidents got 
together to talk about managing peace instead of war 
much of the wariness of usmexican relations has dissipated of 
late with luck and hard work the once unthinkable notion of a 
free trade agreement will be a reality in a couple of years the 
idea of a free trade zone in the caribbean also is gaining 
momentum a decade ago that region seemed ripe for ideological 
conflict 
the tensions in southern africa seem tamer than before cubans 
are leaving angola and the south african government has taken long 
strides toward ending its status as a pariah state the tumultuous 
reception being given to former prisoner nelson mandela on his us 
visit demonstrates how deeply rooted the concept of equal rights 
under law has become 
south african president fw de klerk has yet to dismantle some 
of the most objectionable aspects of apartheid such as the 
restrictions on where blacks can live 
but south africans can take some encouragement from the peaceful 
evolution to democracy in namibia a former south african colony 
where the white minority lorded it over the black majority for 
decades amid the hubbub over mandela namibias president sam 
nujoma passed through washington on monday almost unnoticed 
mandela seems to be on everybodys most admired list these days 
with the exception of some worried whites back home not the least 
of his feats has been the ability in his travels to charm both 
palestinians and jews one of the few things both groups have been 
able to agree on

the first time richard nixon saw 
pat ryan she turned him down for a date but he boldly predicted 
that one day they would marry 
on thursday the former president and his wife celebrated their 
50th wedding anniversary surrounded by their children and 
grandchildren 
there was nothing grandiose about it just a family gathering at 
the nixon home tucked away in the woods nixon celebrations are 
usually lowkey and private 
on this occasion they allowed an associated press reporter and 
photographer to visit providing a rare glimpse of the former first 
lady who has been out of public view since nixon resigned from the 
white house in 1974 
despite illnesses over the years including a major stroke in 
1976 and a mild one in 1983 mrs nixon looked well still slender 
and wearing her blond hair in much the style it was in the white 
house she walked unaided carried on a genial conversation and 
smiled readily for the camera 
the nixons two grandsons and two granddaughters cavorted around 
while the golden anniversary picture was taken a few minutes 
later relieved of having to pose any more two of the children 
were in bathing suits and splashing in the pool 
the nixons allowed the outsiders to visit only on ground rules 
that their remarks were not to be published 
they usually celebrate special occasions with only their 
immediate family edward and tricia cox and their son christopher 
11 and david and julie eisenhower and their children jennie 11 
alex 9 and melanie 6 
the pictures were made in the woodsy panorama that extends from 
the back of the nixon house down from a natural deck past the 
garden that mrs nixon tends past the swimming pool where the 
former president swims laps each evening to the tennis court used 
most often for basketball practice by the two grandsons 
mrs nixon wore a pink and white adele simpson suit for the 
anniversary portrait her daughters said the suit was a favorite 
from the white house years 
the former president and his wife will move soon to a town house 
in park ridge about a mile away to escape the burden of caring for 
a fouracre estate 
the nixons met in whittier calif in 1938 at the casting 
tryouts for the dark tower a play by george s kaufman and 
alexander woollcott 
i thought i knew everyone in whittier but that night a 
beautiful and vivacious young woman with titian hair appeared whom 
i had never seen before nixon said in his memoirs i found i 
could not take my eyes away from her for me it was a case of love 
at first sight he got the part of barry jones and she played 
daphne martin 
i got a friend to introduce us and then offered them both a 
ride home said nixon on the way i asked pat if she would like 
a date with me she said im very busy i said you shouldnt 
say that because someday im going to marry you 
nixon was then a young partner in the law firm of wingert 
bewley and nixon and pat taught business courses at whittier high 
school for 190 a month they were married on june 21 1940 in 
what he describes as a small family ceremony at the mission inn 
in riverside and honeymooned in mexico 
pat was the name she substituted for the name she was born with 
and disliked thelma catherine 
mrs nixon has consistently been on lists of americas most 
admired women even though she is seldom seen her husband has 
emerged as a prolific commentator on world events and a political 
prognosticator he has written eight books seven since the 
presidency 
although mrs nixons 1976 stroke left one side paralyzed she 
recovered fully her health however has been fragile and she has 
been hospitalized several times 
in a biography of her mother julie said the first stroke came 
on the day her mother read the final days the bob woodward 
and carl bernstein account of nixons resignation 
for mother the most unbearable part of the book was the 
analysis of her marriage as loveless mrs eisenhower wrote and 
she said of her parents marriage 
together they traveled far but by a turn of fate most of 
their journey was taken in the public eye the political road 
was not easy for one who had always valued her privacy and 
independence

the center cafe seems like many other 
restaurants theres pipedin music white tableclothes and vases 
with yellow carnations 
it is different mike who is homeless is welcome there with a 
coupon someone handed him on the street 
i dont know who he was just some dude give me this coupon 
so i came in he said as he poked at a helping of cole slaw 
during a recent lunch 
this food is pretty good 
mike got his hot meal through a food coupon program on skid row 
designed to give people an alternative to handing out spare change 
that may go for cheap wine or drugs instead of food 
houston has a similar program and one is planned for the fall in 
philadelphia using tokens 
the los angeles program is operated by the weingart foundation 
which runs a health clinic housing programs and offers drug and 
rehabilitation from the weingart center near the cafe on skid row 
we needed a way to help people deal with panhandlers and that 
uncomfortable situation people run across every day of not knowing 
what to do when people are asking for money said elizabeth 
bailey weingarts vice president of development and public 
relations 
the program which is considered a model was started in march 
1989 since then 22000 of the coupons have been distributed 
besides hot meals the recipients are encouraged to use other 
weingart services 
many of the coupons are purchased by businesses which hand them 
out to employees to use when approached on the street for money 
some companies buy a batch of coupons and give them back to 
weingart to help the foundation raise money 
the cafe set up by weingart to purposely not look like a soup 
kitchen also serves free meals to people in other weingart 
programs and offers meals at a low cost to people who stroll in off 
the street 
despite the success the plan has some drawbacks 
the coupons can only be redeemed at the cafe giving them to 
homeless people elsewhere in the sprawling city would do little 
good because they might never get to the skid row cafe 
the program doesnt prevent people from buying drugs or alcohol 
by selling the coupons on the street where they are said to be 
worth 150 
still homeless advocates see the coupon program as one of the 
better ways to help both the homeless and those who are approached 
by panhandlers 
people feel a little better about giving a homeless person a 
ticket if they know that it is being used for something good 
said steve bryant operations director of the search homeless 
project which started the food program in houston 
the los angeles cafe offers a different main dish each day to 
the holders of coupons but they have a choice of side dishes 
offered up on steam tables a breakfast of bacon and eggs is 
available to people without coupons for less than 1 
many of the cafes customers dont have coupons and pay the low 
price for meals 
in philadelphia businesses and homeless advocates are gearing 
up for a food token program in the fall organizers hope to sell 
tokens in local stores with window stickers advertising token 
outlets 
the tokens will be good for meals in dining rooms to be set up 
the whole thrust of the program is to get the panhandlers up 
off the street said nancy gold head of the token program 
when people give them money what theyre doing is supporting 
them staying there

democrats unable to override president bushs 
veto of a bill to let federal workers join political campaigns now 
want to extend the ban to bushs cabinet and hundreds of other 
presidential appointees 
whats good for the goose is good for the gander sen david 
pryor dark said in introducing the new bill thursday earlier 
the senate failed by two votes to override bush veto of the 
legislation to broaden federal workers political rights 
pryors new bill would extend the 1939 hatch acts ban on 
federal workers political activities to the more than 350 
employees on the white house payroll and another 600 presidential 
appointees 
in vetoing the earlier bill friday bush said that allowing 
federal workers to participate in campaigns would inevitably lead 
to repoliticizing the federal work force and destroy its 
essential political neutrality 
if thats your big concern stop appointing those 
ambassadors who simply gave 100000 to the republican committee 
said rep gerry sikorski dminn who with rep william clay 
dmo introduced pryors bill in the house over the last dozen 
years the number of political appointees in the federal work force 
has increased almost 60 percent 
the senate override attempt failed on a 6535 vote with three 
republican supporters switching their votes to deny the needed 
twothirds majority all 55 democrats voted to override 
when the bill was passed by the senate in may with a potentially 
vetooverriding 6730 majority 13 republicans had supported it 
reversing their earlier votes thursday were sens alfonse damato 
of new york pete v domenici of new mexico and trent lott of 
mississippi 
the white house also picked up the support of republican sens 
pete wilson of california and kit bond of missouri both had missed 
the vote in may 
the house with nearly half of its republicans bolting the 
administration voted 32793 wednesday to override bushs veto 46 
votes more than needed 
democrats attributed the senate loss to white house pressure on 
republicans to maintain bushs perfect record of overpowering 
congress in all 11 previous veto showdowns his first 17 months in 
office 
all of us regret that the merits of this struggle were 
overshadowed by partisan appeals to preserve the presidents 
unbroken string of consecutive vetoes sustained by congress sen 
edward m kennedy dmass said 
the closest bush has come to losing a veto override was last 
july when 34 senators by a single vote upheld his veto of a bill 
to impose conditions on his sale of fsx jet fighter technology to 
japan 
senate gop leader bob dole of kansas offered another explanation 
for the vote switch democratic desires to bolster the political 
action committees of federal employee unions which funneled 88 
percent of their campaign contributions in the 1988 election to 
democrats 
the pac heads of the letter carriers and others unions want 
more power to raise more money to give to democrats dole said 
thats how it works around here money is power 
the legislation would have allowed 3 million federal and postal 
workers for the first time in 51 years to attend political 
conventions and caucuses as delegates on their own time and 
speak at rallies on behalf of candidates 
it also would have removed a ban on government workers holding 
offices in local state or national political organizations or 
soliciting donations from coworkers for federal employee and 
postal union political action committees 
federal workers however still would have been prohibited from 
taking leaves of absence to seek elected public office or 
soliciting campaign contributions from the general public or on 
behalf of a specific candidate 
in introducing his bill pryor said that under current law a 
federal employee who cannot stuff envelopes of his own volition 
can in effect be required to write a partisan political speech 
for his boss the agency head

outside the door a red light shines to show 
the navys emergency coordination center is at work inside the 
names of the dead and wounded from the fire and explosion aboard 
the uss midway are printed on a white board for all to see 
the names of the dead are highlighted in blue 
hunched over rows of telephones scribbling names and phone 
numbers some 20 navy officers and enlisted men and women speak 
calmly to frantic relatives unsure about their loved ones half a 
world away 
may i have your sons name do you know his social security 
number a young officer asks 
she pauses searches the board in front of her and offers the 
best news a worried mother could hear maam his name is not on 
the list 
in the first 30 hours after the center opened the navy logged 
more than 6100 calls from friends and family concerned about the 
4500 sailors aboard the aircraft carrier stricken in the ocean off 
japan on wednesday 
even after the fire that broke out deep inside the huge ship was 
put out and news reports about the incident abated the calls 
continued to pour in 
as the other services do in such times of tragedy the navy 
geared up its phone bank in the basement of the navy annex on a 
hill above the pentagon soon after the midway fire broke out 
we just grabbed people out of the hall to staff the first 
calls coming in said rear adm frank gallo who heads the naval 
personnel command and is in charge of the center weve got a lot 
of good people they pitch in and help and do what needs to be 
done 
one volunteer who helped take calls lt synthia jones of 
daphne ala said she was just as nervous as some of the callers 
then i thought if it were my family how would i treat them 
they were comforted just to know they could talk to someone 
she said 
petty officer james newsham said he sometimes felt hampered 
knowing that fires on board ships are so critical and that 
information wasnt easy to come by in the first hours of the crisis 
newsham an electrical technician from bay city mich said he 
was sometimes taken aback by the reaction to his news on the other 
end of the line 
youd say no maam that names not on our list and youd 
hear a yell like the home team just scored a touchdown he said 
even though newsham said he tried to answer each and every 
question he knew he had to be brief because there were so many 
callers waiting 
several said they were frustrated with trying to get through 
but as a sailor its reassuring to know that america does 
care he said over an eighthour period newsham said he 
answered 450 to 500 calls 
another phone bank is set up so navy officials can get in touch 
with the families of those who have been identified as casualties 
and help make arrangements if two family members choose to travel 
to them 
if a family member calls in who has not yet been notified by the 
navy that a relative has been identified as wounded or deceased 
their telephone number and location is taken and the case is handed 
to the officials in the navy casualty assistance division adm 
gallo said 
death notification is only handled by officers from the division 
in person he said 
that office is headed by joe greer a civilian who has worked in 
helping families deal with such crisis for 18 years 
we go to great lengths to get in touch with the families we 
even enlist the state police anyone who might help us greer 
said 
gallo said the phone lines very quickly got swamped and many 
families had to try repeatedly to get information 
we learned something here the admiral said saying he will 
be meeting with the telephone company next week to see if the 
process can be made more flexible so that they can add additional 
lines in such times of crisis

the earthquake that struck northern iran brought 
reminders of another quake that devastated soviet armenia in 1988 
like thursdays earthquake in iran the dec 7 1988 earthquake 
in armenia killed about 25000 people most died in structures that 
collapsed when the quake hit 
its very similar to what we had in armenia said russ 
needham a geophysicist with the us geological survey 
the armenian quake was measured at 69 on the richter scale but 
thursdays earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 77 
according to the us geological survey 
in the iranian quake the casualty count was pushed up by the 
fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time just after 
midnight many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a 
ceramictype brick or adobe that collapses easily 
in the armenian quake a soviet parliamentary report later 
blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings 
most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something 
falling on top of you said needham in a telephone interview from 
golden colo 
the quake struck an area of iran where most of the buildings are 
built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an 
earthquake and allows structures to collapse needham said 
the 77magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that 
area where two major plates of the earths crust meet he said 
iran is in a very active seismic region he said and that 
there have been many smaller quakes 
twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in 
iran during the last 30 years needham said 
a quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake capable 
of widespread heavy damage in populated areas

iranian state television showed chilling 
scenes from the earthquakedevastated north including collapsed 
buildings and a stuffed toy and a small shoe lying in a 
debrischoked street 
but news anchors showed little emotion at the film clips of 
death and destruction the quake killed an estimated 25000 people 
in northern iran 
iranian media monitored from nicosia were quick to report 
thursdays earthquake within a halfhour the official islamic 
republic news agency reported the tremor had been felt in tehran 
the capital 
but subsequent reports some a few minutes apart said the 
damage must have been principally to crops with brief mentions 
that many casualties were feared in zanjan and gilan provinces 
the only color reported for hours was that when the quake hit 
tehran residents were either asleep or watching a world cup soccer 
match between brazil and scotland 
devastating quakes are not new to the country about 25000 
people died in eastern iran in a 1978 earthquake roughly the same 
number died in a december 1988 quake in nearby soviet armenia 
iran has endured other largescale tragedies in recent years an 
estimated 1 million iranians were killed or wounded in the 
eightyear war with iraq that ended in 1988 and the islamic 
revolution that in 1979 toppled the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
cost hundreds of thousands of lives 
official radio was off the air when the earthquake struck 
during the iraniraq war it would come back on the air after 
signoff to report important news but there was no such move 
thursday 
iranian radio first reported the earthquake on the main newscast 
6 hours later 
the radio like irna also kept listeners informed about the 
areas hit and the number of casualties but again the reporting 
lacked color and description for hours 
the televisions first shots from the stricken north were 
screened 12 hours after the quake with no comment from reporters 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani declared three days of 
mourning for the quakes victims 
during the 40day mourning period declared after the death of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini last year only recitations from the 
koran islams holy book and documentaries on the revolution were 
allowed on televison 
but on thursday cartoons and an educational program for 
children were aired and the television ended its programming with 
live transmission of a world cup soccer match between egypt and 
england

a states rights dispute among administration 
officials could hold up a proposal to require nutrition labeling on 
nearly all packaged foods government sources say 
white house officials oppose the health and human services 
departments efforts to set up a uniform national foodlabeling 
system that would supersede state rules said the sources speaking 
thursday on condition of anonymity 
the food industry has been lobbying strongly for the 
administration to propose national labeling regulations that could 
not be disturbed by the states although california is the only one 
that currently might be affected 
we have a national food system said roger coleman a 
spokesman for the national food processors association we need 
to have a free flow of these goods throughout the country and to 
avoid consumer confusion we need to have a national uniform system 
of food labeling 
legislation pending in the house and the senate would preempt 
any state nutritionlabeling requirements 
in announcing last march that the food and drug administration 
would propose foodlabeling changes hhs secretary louis sullivan 
said states would be able to add to the federal requirements 
but sullivan recently sent to the office of management and 
budget proposed regulations for uniform national rules government 
and industry sources familiar with the regulations said 
the department had hoped to announce the regulations and publish 
them in the federal register next week 
however omb officials argue the philosophical principles of 
federalism in opposing preemption of state rules the sources said 
there is opposition from a number of agencies one source 
said 
omb spokeswoman dede spitznagel said officials at the agency 
could not comment on the hhs proposal because it was still under 
review 
it was not clear whether the disagreement over preemption would 
hold up the regulations one source said i think it will resolve 
in the near future 
jeff nedelman a spokesman for the grocery manufacturers of 
america said the food industry supports labeling regulations as 
long as they are applied uniformly across the country as are 
labeling rules for meat and poultry 
food industry officials have argued that if states are allowed 
to add their own labeling requirements on top of federal labeling 
rules food companies could face as many as 50 different sets of 
requirements 
there is neither a medical nor a health reason why consumers 
in one state need different health information about products than 
people living anywhere else in the country nedelman said 
without uniformity nationwide consumers would be confused and 
manufacturers might decide not to market their products in states 
where requirements varied from the majority he said 
california could be affected most directly by a federal 
preemption because that states proposition 65 allows officials 
to require consumer warnings on products they deem to pose a risk 
of birth defects or cancer the cancerwarning is being challenged 
in court 
however some observers say the california initiative would not 
be affected because the regulations being drafted apply only to 
nutrition content 
other pending regulations though would cover health messages 
or claims and some believe that if federal nutrition labeling is 
deemed preemptive that will be extended to health messages as 
well

the governments list of foreigners barred from 
the country for political reasons is far longer than previously 
thought and most names were added since the reagan administration 
documents show 
details of the socalled lookout book emerged in documents 
released in response to a lawsuit brought by a prizewinning 
colombian journalist who was turned back at a new york airport four 
years ago 
the list previously estimated by immigration lawyers to have 
some 40000 names has 353324 entries from 146 countries 
territories and other areas more than twothirds of the entries 
appear to come after 1980 
officials cautioned there was no way of knowing how many 
individuals were on the list because some of the names are entered 
more than once 
assistant us attorney chad vignola who handled the 
governments case said that an estimate by a lawyer for the 
journalist patricia lara of more than 300000 individuals is 
simply wrong 
nevertheless its the first time that concrete dimension has 
been given to the magnitude and scope of this lookout system 
laras lawyer arthur c helton said thursday 
us district judge john m walker ruling last september in 
laras case ordered the list turned over to her lawyers he said 
the names of people on the list should remain secret to protect 
them 
the list called the national automated immigration lookout 
system was turned over to helton earlier this month after more 
legal wrangling 
in the past the list usually came to light only when the 
government excluded famous people including many whose writings 
and movies were widely available here at the time the artists 
themselves were barred 
they included nobel laureates gabriel garcia marquez and pablo 
neruda authors graham greene doris lessing and carlos fuentes 
french actor yves montand and former rhodesian prime minister ian 
smith 
the entries on the list date to 1904 but the vast bulk of 
entries come under three sections of the 1952 mccarrenwalter act 
the sections roughly cover security risks political beliefs and 
subversion and violent activities 
most of the individuals at least 341000 entries were barred 
because of their political beliefs according to helton an 
attorney at the new yorkbased lawyers committee for human rights 
i think the disclosure is astounding both in terms of the 
magnitude of the listings and the high level of current denial 
helton said 
he said that more than twothirds of the books entries 
238140 were made since 1980 and 4399 in the first three months 
of 1990 
the increased number of exclusions came at a time when both 
congress and the courts were trying to narrow the scope of who 
could be excluded helton said 
that goal was achieved in february when president bush signed a 
law prohibiting the exclusion of visitors on the basis of political 
belief in the case of anarchists communists or adherents to 
totalitarian beliefs 
many immigration lawyers claim that the state department is 
ignoring the spirit of the law and continuing to exclude aliens for 
political reasons 
the government is not obliged to justify its exclusion 
decisions in the most recent entry on the watch list for 
example dated march 1 the state department excluded 46 people 
under the political provision 
a state department spokesman philip covington acknowledged 
that exclusion decisions have been subjective 
obviously the law is interpreted in different ways at 
different times he said 
the highest number of exluded visitors were from china with 
106777 entries the soviet union was in the middle range with 
33064 
ms lara a 1980 graduate of the columbia university graduate 
school of journalism came to new york in 1986 to receive the maria 
moors cabot prize awarded for advancing interamerican 
understanding and freedom of information she was detained at 
kennedy international airport her visa was revoked and she was 
sent back to colombia without a hearing 
authorities alleged she was linked to a colombian terrorist 
group ms lara maintained she was barred for writing articles 
critical of us policy in central america

the administration is abandoning plans for 
limitedservice methadone clinics that provide the drug but little 
else to heroin addicts waiting for an opening in a comprehensive 
treatment program 
officials at the health and human services department decided to 
withdraw the nofrills proposal because of hefty criticism 
mona brown a spokeswoman for the national institute on drug abuse 
said thursday 
the comments and testimony at public hearings didnt support 
going ahead she said we are rescinding those regulations 
interim methadone maintenance clinics were proposed by the 
institute and the food and drug administration to help curb the 
spread of aids among intravenous drug users who can transmit the 
virus when they share needles 
in some cities drug addicts have to wait for six months or more 
to get into a comprehensive methadone treatment program that 
provides support and counseling 
without the regulations however drug abuse treatment centers 
can still apply for a waiver to allow them to set up an interim 
clinic and dispense methadone on an outpatient basis brown said 
beth israel medical center in new york city is the only 
healthcare facility currently operating an interim clinic under a 
waiver 
the proposed regulations would have eliminated the waiver 
process and made it easier for treatment centers to operate interim 
programs in these programs heroin addicts unable to get into a 
comprehensive program can get methadone daily at outpatient clinics 
and from mobile medical units 
but critics disputed the effectiveness of methadone treatment to 
wean addicts from heroin and some feared that because of tight 
budgets the limitedservice programs would gradually replace 
comprehensive programs 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics abuse and control who opposed the proposed 
regulations praised the move by the health and human services 
department 
what addicts need and seek is comprehensive treatment allowing 
integration into a fully productive life with education job skills 
and emotional support to stay drug free rangel said in a 
statement 
just sending addicts back into the street with a different 
drug is no answer he said now i hope we begin developing a 
strong comprehensive national treatment strategy 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan told rangels 
panel last august that methadone programs were not ideal but 
this we feel is better than nothing for those individuals 
however studies by the congressional general accounting office 
and the drug enforcement administration questioned the wisdom of 
the departments plan they cited continued drug abuse by many 
patients in methadone treatment and illegal diversion of the drug

texas developer leonard briscoe refused to 
answer questions before congressional investigators looking into 
the housing scandals citing his constitutional right against 
selfincrimination 
briscoe of fort worth on thursday became the sixth witness to 
invoke his fifth amendment right in spurning questions from the 
house government operations subcommittee on housing 
he is the first such witness however who was not a former 
official of the scandalplagued department of housing and urban 
development former hud secretary samuel r pierce jr now the 
object of a special prosecutors investigation was among those who 
would not answer questions 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif said he intended to 
provide special prosecutor arlin adams a letter requesting that his 
inquiry be expanded and setting forth in detail evidentiary 
support 
briscoe contended that his attorney had not been given enough 
time to prepare for the testimony and had been refused a delay in 
his appearance under subpoena 
but lantos said briscoe had initially agreed to testify 
voluntarily and waited too long to obtain a new lawyer after his 
first one withdrew because of a conflict of interest 
he posed five questions to briscoe mostly about his 
relationship with lance wilson a former top hud official who later 
became a housing consultant and was involved in several projects 
receiving lucrative hud grants 
briscoe declined to answer each question his attorney irvin b 
nathan angrily denounced lantos outside the hearing room 
the chairmans conduct today clearly indicates it was not a 
fair hearing nathan said 
dubois gilliam a former deputy assistant secretary of hud now 
serving a prison sentence testified under immunity last month and 
named briscoe in describing how lucrative federal housing and 
community development grants were steered to favored developers 
wilson was involved in four lowincome housing projects in 
florida and texas in which he provided assistance or was paid 
consulting fees or given a percentage interest one of the 
questions briscoe refused to answer was why he gave wilson a 15 
percent interest in one project in riviera beach fla 
outside the hearing room briscoe denied making any improper 
payments or gifts to wilson or gilliam 
wilson is a former executive assistant to pierce and has also 
invoked his constitutional right to avoid testifying

the 1990 farm bill goes to the senate without 
the boost in financial guarantees many democrats wanted to give 
farmers but with a promise of support from key republicans 
theres not everything in here that every member would want 
and i appreciate that senate agriculture committee chairman 
patrick leahy dvt said thursday after the panel approved the 
bill but he said the measure makes sense for farmers and 
consumers and is within the budget 
leahy had worked particularly hard to strengthen environmental 
provisions including research to help farmers reduce chemical 
additives and revise agricultural trade policies to better assist 
poor countries and governments moving toward democracy 
a section that would protect private forest land also was added 
to the measure that sets farm policy for five years 
the estimated cost of the price supports over the life of the 
bill is 55 billion 
sen richard lugar of indiana the committees ranking 
republican said both he and senate gop leader bob dole of kansas 
would support the measure on the floor 
the house agriculture committee finished work on its version of 
the bill last week with floor action expected early in july 
the committee approved the bill on a 154 vote with sens 
thomas daschle dsd max baucus dmont howell heflin dala 
and slade gorton rwash opposing it 
lugar had said he would cause trouble for the legislation in the 
senate if the democrats raised subsidies and moved the bill out of 
committee on a party line vote the democrats have a 109 majority 
on the panel 
in order to get something to the floor we had to make some 
compromises said sen thomas harkin diowa who said he would 
fight to increase target prices and loan rates once the senate 
debate begins senator lugar and the republicans dug in their 
heels 
heflin said target prices wont keep up with inflation under the 
legislation and should have been higher baucus and daschle also 
wanted higher supports 
gorton said he voted against the bill because of its soybean 
program and the committees refusal to reform secondary programs 
like honey wool and mohair 
the plan on loan rates accepted by the committee gives the 
agriculture secretary two options 
the loan rate is the amount of money the government pays the 
farmer in advance to cover production using the expected crops as 
collateral if the market price is lower than the loan rate the 
farmer can forfeit his crops to the government instead of paying 
back the loan 
the secretarys first option would be to make loans under 
existing formulas though never dipping below the 1990 level he 
would not be able to activate the socalled findley provision a 
method used to reduce loan rates to bring us prices for 
commodities in line with the world market 
the secretarys second option allows him to use the findley 
provision but requires that he pay the farmer in advance three 
quarters of a cent for every penny he reduces the loan rate this 
would be in addition to any other advance payments and would have 
to be repaid by the farmer nine months after the start of the 
marketing year 
if the secretary selects the second option he would have to give 
the house and senate agriculture committees an explanation why 
based on budget implications farm income orderly marketing price 
competitiveness and avoidance of excess stocks 
acceptance of this loan rate provision was viewed as a 
concession by the republicans but barely better than nothing by 
the democrats 
some other provisions of the bill 
milk price supports at a minimum of 1010 per hundred pounds 
the current rate 
a soybean marketing loan rate of 550 per bushel 
if malting barley prices exceed feed barley prices by more than 
22 cents the excess above 22 cents would not be considered in 
establishing the barley deficiency payment 
for every 10 percent decrease in final deficiency payments that 
result from an increase in prices the agriculture secretary would 
give 2 percentage points of the decrease back to the farmer

maybe it was the coming of summer whatever 
the reason 150 to 200 holstein cows broke loose from a farm and 
strolled into this suburban community south of seattle 
the cows fanned out after escaping from joe neffs auburn farm 
just before midnight wednesday but most headed south along the 
valley freeway 
i couldnt believe it they busted out of the barn and broke 
through a halfinchthick steel gate neff said 
the cows didnt make it to downtown kent or auburn but their 
proximity was sensed 
when i came to work at midnight it smelled like the chicago 
stockyards said auburn jail officer jim miller 
it took police in cars and on foot several hours to round up the 
strays the last of them were returned to the barn by 630 am 
thursday 
the police are very good cowboys neff said

the state department in a followup to 
president bushs suspension of the us dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization thursday urged americans traveling to the 
middle east and elsewhere to exercise extra caution 
deputy spokesman richard boucher attributed the advisory to 
rising tensions in the area but said he was unaware of any specific 
threats 
he said it was possible that the tension might increase as a 
result of bushs announcement but he stressed there were other 
reasons for the warning as well 
he recalled that on may 31 the day after the abortive attack by 
the palestine liberation front on beaches near tel aviv the 
department had said it was concerned about tensions in the region 
and that terrorists had threatened to attack american citizens or 
interests

us military force reductions in south korea 
should be used to bargain for concessions from communist north 
korea a member of the us senate armed services committee says 
because some reduction of the 43000strong us military force 
in south korea is inevitable we should make a virtue of 
necessity by using troop cuts as leverage for peace especially in 
light of the need to engage north korea in dialogue sen timothy 
e wirth dcolo said in a speech 
in short we should link coming troop reductions to a 
redoubled effort at reconciliation on the korean peninsula wirth 
told a wednesday meeting of korean experts hosted by the cato 
foundation a nonpartisan washington think tank 
noting that north korean propaganda since 1953 has been aimed at 
the us military presence wirth suggested pyongyang might respond 
to such an approach 
north korea cannot remain unaffected by world changes 
especially in light of the changes under way in its superpower 
allies he said the issue is how pyongyang will manage the 
inevitable transition from a closed society to a more open one 
from the 40year rule of kim ilsung to a new generation

demonstrations at the worlds largest 
meeting on aids have taken on a predictable pattern a 
themeoftheday march speakers and street theater followed by a 
sitin 
each morning a dispatch is sent out by act up the aids 
coalition to unleash power detailing the days planned 
demonstration it ends each time with the same phrase civil 
disobedience is anticipated during the protest 
the groups activities produced about 50 arrests thursday 
bringing the total to 149 since the start of the sixth 
international conference on aids 
on thursday the sitin was at the busy intersection of market 
and van ness where 50 protesters ignored police warnings and 
huddled in the street several hundred other demonstrators remained 
on the sidewalk yelling the groups slogan act up fight back 
fight aids 
before the sitin protesters lighted a small bonfire of protest 
placards spray painted dayglo slogans and outlined their bodies 
with chalk to symbolize how the citys largely volunteer effort to 
fight aids has been exhausted 
despite some claims of police brutality there has been little 
violence other than some shoving and a few bruised and bloodied 
knuckles from police batons 
while anticipated disruptions of science sessions at the moscone 
center have failed to materialize the protest organizers are 
pleased with their showing so far 
i think weve been very effective about getting on the agenda 
and getting our voices heard said josh gamson a member of the 
san francisco chapter of act up it was very ambitious to get a 
different theme out there each day 
the theme for wednesday was access for those with aids to 
research and policy making 
on thursday demonstrators marched a winding route through san 
franciscos civic center area to point out what they claim is a 
lack of government action and funding for aids programs 
the march had stops at federal state and city office buildings 
a mock trial was held outside the offices of state insurance 
commissioner roxannie gillespi who was criticized for failing to 
respond to charges that insurance companies were discriminating 
against people with aids 
a few dozen demonstrators stormed into the building lobby but 
left a short time later

defense secretary dick cheney is asking 
congress to cancel 68 of the most obvious construction 
projects mostly in europe and excluding strategic homeports in 
the united states 
the overwhelming majority of the projects are located in europe 
with only three sites in the united states 
they were chosen from a list of 207 projects worth 12 billion 
cheney has been considering canceling notably absent from the list 
sent to congress on thursday were the navys strategic home 
ports in texas alabama mississippi and new york 
defense department spokesman pete williams said the remaining 
projects still were under consideration for cancellation including 
the home ports but that decisions on those would take more time 
we know we are not going to need these facilities williams 
said of thursdays list these are the cuts that are the most 
obvious 
cheney has come under intense criticism on capitol hill for 
taking aim at military sites in democrats districts as he has 
moved to pare funds from the pentagon budget in this time of 
lessened eastwest tensions 
the list contains a variety of construction projects including 
schools for military dependents in west germany munitions storage 
centers in italy a mess hall on guam and even a classified 
threeunit housing project for families associated with the 
supersecret national security agency 
in the united states the list includes 39 million for a supply 
warehouse at red river texas 19 million for an addition to the 
flight simulator at luke air force base in arizona and 56000 for 
fireplaces at wrightpatterson air force base in ohio 
the secretary disapproves of installing fireplaces in senior 
officers quarters the pentagon announcement said no other site 
was singled out for mention 
formally cheneys action means that he is asking congress to 
rescind the funds for the projects which were authorized for 
payment in past years 
the move requires congressional approval and the funds will not 
revert to the pentagon coffers williams said 
the spokesman said cheneys decision to freeze nearly 7 billion 
worth of military construction projects remains in effect and that 
additional requests to stop other projects could be made from that 
entire group 
while the pentagon weighed the fate of the navy homeports two 
senior democrats on the house armed services committee released a 
congressional report showing that the navy has not halted ongoing 
construction at the staten island facility despite lawmakers 
letters calling for a stoppage 
work under contracts already awarded has continued unabated 
and the navy is going ahead with plans to dedicate the new york 
naval station on june 25 1990 the general accounting office 
said 
in addition the gao found that eight families of military 
personnel assigned to the cruiser uss normandy have moved to staten 
island and 131 families are in the process of relocating from 
norfolk va to new york 
in a letter reps charles bennett dfla and patricia 
schroeder dcolo urged cheney to reverse engines on all family 
relocations to staten island 
families should not have to sell their homes leave friends 
and change schools just to have to turn around and return to their 
old homes when the staten island homeport is finally and 
permanently closed bennett and schroeder said

nelson and winnie mandela made hope live again 
for a while on a harlem street corner brimming with history 
the hope and the pride were evident on the faces of the 
100000 admirers as two black cultures american and south african 
intertwined thursday in a rally outside the harlem state office 
building 
this is a day like none other in the history of harlem 
resident isabel coles said it brings together the american black 
and the african this day symbolizes that we are one in spirit we 
are still african 
some celebrated their africanamerican heritage by wearing red 
orange yellow gold or green dashikis a type of african tribal 
robe others simply wore mandela tshirts and buttons 
most reveled with the sound of african drumbeats jamaican 
reggae and american jazz even a policeman danced when a bob marley 
recording blared over the loudspeaker 
mandela the 71yearold african national congress leader told 
the crowd that harlem helped him win his freedom after spending 27 
years in a south african prison for antiapartheid activities 
i am able to speak to you because of the massive resistance of 
our people and the unceasing solidarity of millions throughout the 
world it is you the working people of harlem that helped to make 
it happen 
the kinship that the anc feels for the people of harlem goes 
deeper than skin color mandela said it is a kinship of our 
shared historical experience and the kinship and the solidarity of 
the victims of blind prejudice and hatred 
the rally was held on a corner 125th street and adam clayton 
powell boulevard that until a decade or so ago symbolized the 
harlem equivalent of londons hyde park panafricanists 
garveyites and malcolm x stood on crates or platforms to speak 
before rallies or to passersby 
this time the stage and the audience was considerably 
larger but mandela didnt forget the black heroes of yesteryear 
the crowd cheered as mandela evoked names like martin luther 
king malcolm x marcus garvey the black nationalist leader of the 
1920s singeractor paul robeson and the late congressman for whom 
the boulevard was named 
the stage was shared by malcolm xs widow betty shabazz she 
wept when mrs mandela embraced her 
time is very short and i would like to stand right here and 
cry for a thousand years but i cannot said ms shabazz a woman 
in the crowd shouted out me too 
i greet you all in the soweto of america mrs mandela said 
it is a great honor for me and especially the women of my 
country to stand here in the capital of the revolution throughout 
the world harlem 
mandela added while my comrades and i were in prison we 
followed closely your own story of the injustices of racial 
segregation and economic inequities 
to our people he said harlem symbolizes strength and 
beauty in resistance

nelson mandelas passionate plea for black 
equality inspired legions of joyful supporters who packed the 
streets of harlem on thursday in one of the most emotional and 
exuberant stops on his world tour 
for generations of american blacks harlem has served as 
cultural capital and mandelas visit before a crowd that police 
estimated at 100000 was a tribute to his fight for racial justice 
brothers and sisters comrades and friends victory is in 
sight mandela said the light at the end of the tunnel is so 
bright but we are not yet there 
to reach the end of the tunnel it requires that we make the 
necessary sacrifices it requires that we remain unrelenting in 
pursuit of our goal 
recalling part of a speech he gave the day he was sentenced to 
prison mandela told the crowd that abolishing apartheid is an 
idea which i am prepared to live for but if need be it is an idea 
for which i am prepared to die 
he added that while in prison he was aware of the resistance 
of the people of harlem and continue to be inspired by your 
indomitable spirit 
my only regret is that i am unable to embrace each and every 
one of you he said 
the crowd which filled streets balconies and fire escapes 
responded enthusiastically to mandela and his wife winnie with 
shouts and raised fists 
mandela told the crowd he was moved by a slogan he had seen on a 
womans sweatshirt earlier in his visit it said black by 
nature proud by choice 
mandelas visit to the united states has tapped into a deep vein 
of emotion in black communities in new york a surge of pride has 
welled up in neighborhoods where selfesteem is often lacking 
he spoke in harlem at 125th street and adam clayton powell 
boulevard a corner long associated with political oratory from 
black leaders including web dubois martin luther king jr paul 
robeson malcolm x and the former congressman for whom the 
boulevard was named 
from harlem mandela went to yankee stadium in the impoverished 
south bronx where he told a sellout crowd of 52000 that he always 
knew americans were thinking of him when he was imprisoned 
you the people never abandoned us even when we passed 
through the most difficult years he said we are winning 
because you made victory possible 
he said the anc vision of a democratic south africa is a 
society free of all sort of racism and sexism 
his solemn appearance at the stadium ended on a lighter note 
when mayor david dinkins presented mandela a yankees warmup jacket 
and baseball cap 
now you know who i am a beaming mandela said after donning 
the cap i am a yankee 
ticket prices at the stadium ranged from 5 to 500 
the message to keep the pressure on until apartheid is 
abolished has been a constant theme during mandelas 13nation anc 
fundraising tour 
since his arrival on wednesday nearly 1 million people have 
turned out to cheer and greet the african national congress leader 
the celebration began earlier thursday at a joyous ecumenical 
service at riverside church that brought religious leaders of all 
faiths together in a call for equality 
the invitationonly service was anything but solemn as 
participants danced in the aisles to the beat of african drummers 
caught up in the fervor the 71yearold freedom fighter merrily 
waved his fist and bopped to the crowds rhythmic clapping after 
the african national congress choir finished singing its anthem 
addressing the congregation mandela invited longtime supporters 
to come home to claim their rightful role in the recreation of a 
new south africa and thanked the religious community for its long 
support 
the anc leader released feb 11 from a south african prison 
after serving 27 years for antiapartheid activities told the 
crowd of about 2000 that they were entering the final phase of 
their struggle for black equality 
but he also cautioned that the age of freedom has not yet 
dawned and that to lift economic sanctions against the 
whiteminority south african government now would plunge us back 
into the darkness from which our country is painfully struggling to 
emerge 
before the rallies mandela appeared on a local radio show met 
with the editorial board of the new york times and taped a town 
meeting with ted koppel which was to be aired thursday night on 
abctv 
during the koppel show former reagan administration official 
kenneth adelman asked mandela why he supported palestinian leader 
yasser arafat cuban president fidel castro and libyan strongman 
moammar gadhafi 
one of the mistakes the western world makes is to think that 
their enemies should be our enemies mandela replied to the 
audiences loud approval we have our own struggle 
he added that arafat gadhafi and castro support our struggle 
to the hilt there is no reason whatsoever we should have any 
hesitation about their commitment to human rights in south africa 
they are placing resources at our disposal to win the struggle 
before the ecumenical service mandela met privately with 150 
religious leaders and received a 200000 check donations were 
also made during the service but the amount raised was not 
immediately available 
mandela began his day with an impromptu breakfasthour stroll 
through a park adjacent to gracie mansion where he is staying with 
the mayor 
his unannounced appearance sent a dozen security men and scores 
of police officers scurrying to surround him as he walked four 
blocks to the park 
it was very nice he said afterward thank you im sorry 
i didnt think it would be so much trouble 
the security detail dubbed operation topaz is part of a 
massive effort put together by city police and state department 
agents 
police overtime during mandelas threeday stay is expected to 
cost 2 million dinkins said the state department has agreed to 
pick up the tab 
during his first day in new york mandela addressed brooklyn 
students was given a tickertape parade up broadway and received 
the key to the city police estimated 800000 people turned out to 
greet him

a panel of experts says removing a cancerous 
tumor in the early stages of breast cancer gives as good a survival 
chance to women as more radical surgery in which the entire breast 
is removed 
mastectomies in which the entire breast is removed and 
lumpectomies in which only the tumor is removed both give 
excellent results for stage i and stage ii breast cancer the 
panel said 
the committee of 15 experts was assembled by the national 
institutes of health to consider research on the survival of women 
with early stages of breast cancer and to develop a consensus on 
what therapy should be used to treat the disease 
the therapies appear to be equivalent in survival said dr 
william c wood a harvard medical school surgeon and chairman of 
the committee we believe it is preferable to preserve an organ 
mastectomy is still the most commonly used therapy for early 
stage breast cancer wood said a lumpectomy is followed with 
radiation therapy and wood said some patients choose mastectomy 
because they prefer to lose a breast instead of have six weeks of 
radiation therapy 
in its report the committee said surgery in which the breast is 
saved or conserved is an appropriate method of primary therapy 
for the majority of women with stage i and ii breast cancer and is 
preferable because the breast is preserved and the survival 
chances are the same as for mastectomy 
wood said that both mastectomy and lumpectomy involves the 
removal of nearby lymph nodes if these nodes are cancerfree and 
the primary tumor is smaller than one centimeter both methods of 
treatment have about a 90 percent chance of cure 
about 150000 american women will be diagnosed with breast 
cancer this year the committee report said between 75 percent and 
80 percent of this group will have stage i or stage ii disease and 
about twothirds of these will have cancerfree lymph nodes 
stage i and ii cancers have not spread beyond the breast and 
lymph nodes but just how to treat this earlystage breast cancer 
long has been controversial 
traditionally the preferred treatment has been a radical 
mastectomy in which the entire breast and much adjacent tissue is 
removed during the past two decades there have been a number of 
studies comparing the survival results of less extensive breast 
surgery including lumpectomy 
the committee found that based on the studies survival rates 
are virtually the same for the two types of therapy 
the experts said the picture was less clear for followup 
treatment using chemotherapy or a drug that blocks the hormone 
estrogen the studies show a trend that may suggest an advantage in 
taking the follow up or adjuvant therapy but the committee said 
the drugs may be toxic or degrade the patients quality of life 
for patients with very small primary tumors one centimeter or 
less adjuvant therapy is not required the committee said 
the committee also said that the use of lumpectomy should be 
based on an individual evaluation of each patient and with the full 
understanding by the patient of all the options lumpectomies are 
not appropriate for all stage i or ii patients because of the size 
of the breast or the distribution of tumors or calcified lumps 
within the breast the committee said

nelson mandelas us visit 
splashed across most major south african newspapers though 
government broadcasts played down coverage of the black nationalist 
leader 
mandela on a world tour received more subdued media coverage 
on his european swing with reports focusing more on the issue of 
sanctions for south africas white government 
the resurgent coverage since mandelas arrival in new york on 
wednesday may be explained by south africas fascination with 
american hype 
the big apple threw its hat in the air yesterday and 
demonstrated in its best and most extravagant way its admiration 
and affection for nelson mandela in a parade was without precedent 
in the citys history correspondent ramsey milne wrote in 
thursdays edition of the the star the nations largest daily 
mandela wows new york was the stars banner headline 
thursday it carried a large frontpage picture of mandela in 
almost every one of its nine editions wednesday and thursday 
most major newspapers in the country gave prominent play to the 
cheers from american throngs and the praise from american officials 
that greeted mandela when he arrived in new york 
however an evening tv news program ignored the welcome and two 
other government broadcast outlets put on several other news items 
first 
another exception was the sowetan the nations largest black 
daily newspaper it continued the policy it has adopted since 
mandela left for his 14nation sixweek tour by reporting his 
progress on inside pages and devoting its front page to activities 
of the black community inside south africa 
the progovernment englishlanguage newspaper the citizen 
carried the banner headline mandela gets big us welcome on 
thursday its second story covered president bushs remarks 
wednesday that he wanted to show appreciation to president fw de 
klerk for his movements toward ending apartheid 
mandelas historic tickertape parade through manhattan occurred 
too late to be broadcast on the evening television news show of the 
governmentrun south african broadcasting corp on wednesday it 
was shown on the early morning news show thursday but not repeated 
thursday evening so most south africans did not see it 
governmentrun radio south africa led its thursday morning news 
with a report that the us state department had suggested the 
african national congress could receive aid if it gave up violence 
the second item focused on bushs remarks the third news item 
mentioned that mandela had arrived in the united states but gave 
no details on his welcome 
the same order was followed on the thursday evening television 
news broadcast in afrikaans but the mandela items were carried 
later in the tv show which began with a cabinet minister saying 
the government wanted to begin negotiations on a new constitution 
next year

some in this city once notorious for political 
patronage were skeptical that a us supreme court ruling outlawing 
the system of jobs for political work will put such abuses to rest 
but michael shakman a chicago lawyer whose lawsuits helped pare 
patronage in the city said the ruling thursday could affect hiring 
practices throughout the country 
it should result in a much fairer system to applicants for 
jobs who are no longer going to be required to give a political 
loyalty oath in effect in order to get the job shakman said 
fred cooper a georgia republican party official predicted a 
barrage of lawsuits alleging discrimination 
many departments do hire based on what they think the next 
elections will bring he said this will be the basis for 
complaints in the future 
both political parties in illinois have a long track record of 
political hiring but chicagos system became particularly 
wellknown under democratic mayor richard j daley the 
quintessential bigcity boss in office for more than 20 years until 
his death in 1976 
daleys son richard m daley is now mayor of chicago 
political consultant don rose who worked against the elder 
daley said the supreme court ruling is just another step away from 
the late mayors machine 
its just another reason for him to spin in his grave but 
hes probably used to it by now said rose viewed by many as a 
reformer 
a 1973 federal court decree restricted political firings in 
chicago and other governments in northern illinois eight years 
after daleys death the administration of harold washington the 
citys first black mayor agreed to a system intended to prohibit 
most political hiring that system remains intact thursdays 
ruling came in an illinois case and orders an end to political 
hirings firings and promotions the court ruled that federal 
state and local government jobs generally may not be awarded based 
on party affiliation 
the justices voting 54 said constitutionally protected rights 
are violated when people are denied government jobs promotions or 
transfers for reasons of political partisanship partisanship now 
may play a role in deciding who gets a government job only when 
political affiliation is an appropriate requirement such as for 
highlevel policy advisers 
two earlier high court rulings in 1976 and 1980 basically 
restricted political firings 
i just think its a futile attempt to try and change something 
thats been here since the beginning of this city said one of 
cook countys nearly 25000 employees 
told that the high court had basically outlawed patronage the 
employee said itll still be the same thing but itll have a 
different name to it 
the man like other workers interviewed in the lobby of the cook 
county building refused to give his name 
i think patronage will always be everybody has their own 
people said an administrator who has worked for the county for 
14 years 
the supreme court ruling stems from a 1985 federal lawsuit on 
behalf of three illinois residents who claimed they were denied 
state jobs or promotions because they were not active republicans 
the suit was filed against gov james r thompson and other gop 
leaders in illinois and contended the governor made party 
allegiance a requirement for 68000 state jobs under his control 
robert chanin a lawyer who represented the national education 
association in urging the justices to stamp out patronage 
predicted little impact for federal jobs but wide impact on states 
there are probably 40 states that have some type of 
comprehensive merit system but perhaps as many as 10 states and 
puerto rico dont have such systems or have slippage in their merit 
systems they rely primarily on what amounts to a patronage 
system 
thompson who is not running for reelection again denied the 
lawsuits allegations thursday he said he has hired democrats and 
republicans but said he would choose a republican if applicants 
were equally qualified 
i think the parties are worth saving and i think the supreme 
court is naive in saying that patronage has no basis in 
strengthening political parties thompson said 
but rose said if the only reasons political parties can exist 
and thrive is through abusive hiring and firing practices than 
there is no reason for them to survive

with the weekend deadline for its passage 
approaching a constitutional agreement aimed at keeping 
frenchspeaking quebec in the canadian federation was still blocked 
in two provinces 
the agreement must be ratified by all 10 provinces by midnight 
saturday or expire eight of the provinces favor the meech lake 
accord as it is called 
the fivepoint agreement would designate quebec a distinct 
society something the supreme court would be obliged to consider 
when looking at specific laws challenged under the constitution 
quebec is the countrys largest province in terms of land area 
and includes more than onefourth of the countrys 25 million 
people 
prime minister brian mulroney one of the most ardent supporters 
of the agreement flew thursday to newfoundland one of the holdout 
provinces in an effort to save the agreement 
in manitoba province an indian lawmaker demanding constitutional 
recognition of indian tribes as distinct societies has used 
procedural delays to block debate for a week on approval of the 
agreement 
in a restrained but tough address on thursday mulroney 
confronted newfoundlands 52seat legislature with the possibility 
of constitutional paralysis economic problems and increased 
support for the separatist cause 
on that night when youre sitting there with your family and 
your children one thought is going to go through your mind do you 
mean to tell me that we could have avoided all of this for meech 
lake mulroney said 
if that night were ever to come the terms of meech lake are 
going to look very very reasonable indeed to every member of this 
house of assembly and every house of assembly across canada he 
said 
the meech lake agreement first approved by the prime minister 
and the premiers of the provinces in 1987 is aimed at winning 
quebecs signature on canadas 1982 constitution at that time the 
ministers set a threeyear deadline for approval by the parliament 
and legislatures 
in the interim governments changed in three of the provinces 
manitoba newfoundland and new brunswick and the premiers 
reneged on the signatures of their predecessors 
in early june mulroney called the premiers to ottawa where 
they spent a week in intense private meetings they agreed to pass 
the original accord as it is new brunswick passed it last week 
for many quebecois in montreal canadas secondlargest city 
the arguments have worn thin and the endless debate over a document 
thought signed and sealed in 1987 has led to widespread cynicism 
and a rise in nationalist feelings 
premier robert bourassa has categorically rejected suggestions 
for extending the saturday deadline there will be a profound 
disappointment sadness and much disillusionment in quebec he 
said 
a poll published thursday in the frenchlanguage newspaper la 
presse indicated that 57 percent of quebecois favor sovereignty up 
slightly from 56 percent in march 
but unlike a decade ago when a referendum was held by the 
separatist parti quebecois to determine the future of the province 
passion is missing 
i think people have accepted that it meech lake wont pass 
with a shrug said robert gagnon a computer systems specialist 
for a montreal insurance company 
jean chretien leading candidate for the leadership of the 
opposition liberal party told the partys congress in calgary that 
failure of meech lake would not necessarily mean a breakup of 
canada

men infected with aids are 14 times more 
likely to pass on the deadly virus to women during sex than the 
other way around a new study indicates 
researchers looked at 58 male sex partners of infected women and 
found that only one man became infected in that case the couple 
reported having intercourse without condoms more than 1000 times 
over seven years 
the research suggests that in the united states at least the 
aids virus is transmitted far more efficiently from men to women 
than from women to men 
a similar study conducted in europe found considerably less 
difference between the sexes the risk of maletofemale 
transmission was only twice as high as femaletomale 
dr nancy s padian who directed the us study said it was 
unclear whether the difference could be attributed to biological 
differences between the sexes or whether other factors are involved 
heterosexual transmission of aids is still relatively rare in 
the united states it accounts for 5 percent of the 130000 cases 
reported so far 
in africa heterosexual aids is far more common the virus seems 
to spread with equal proficiency from men to women and from women 
to men some experts believe that is because untreated venereal 
disease is relatively common in africa and resulting sores provide 
openings for the virus to enter the body 
despite her findings padian said men should not become 
complacent about the risk of catching acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome from women 
we still recommend caution with unknown sexual partners 
regardless of their gender she said 
padians research conducted at the university of california in 
berkeley was reported thursday at the sixth international 
conference on aids 
her group also studied 269 women who had sex with infected men 
of them 54 women or 20 percent caught the virus 
when the figures were adjusted for the number of sexual 
contacts the researchers calculated that the maletofemale 
transmission was 14 times more common than femaletomale 
in the united states aids is transmitted largely by male 
homosexual intercourse and by sharing hypodermic needles however 
women who have sex with male drug addicts are also at risk as are 
their babies who can catch the virus before birth 
in another report doctors from johns hopkins university 
recommended that all pregnant women be offered the option of aids 
tests 
current health guidelines generally recommend that the tests be 
suggested only for women who admit risky behavior such as drug 
abuse however the johns hopkins study showed that limiting 
testing to these women will miss many who are infected and risk 
passing the virus to their babies 
at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore health care workers 
found that the number of women discovered to be infected more than 
doubled when everyone was offered the test

and party officials 
mengistu urged lawmakers to pass a resolution expressing the 
immediate answer of the ethiopian people to the eritreans 
refusal to resume peace talks a round of talks had been set for 
this month 
the eritreans fighting a 3decadeold secessionist war said 
last week they planned to achieve their goals militarily eritrean

marc bohan the former designer for christian 
dior is expected to take over as artistic director of the fashion 
house of norman hartnell dressmakers to two generations of british 
royalty 
if the bohan appointment is sealed as expected he will become 
the first major french designer to head an english fashion house 
there is a fairly imminent announcement expected hartnells 
chairman manny silverman said thursday we really should be 
resolving it the lawyers in the final analysis have to sort things 
out 
the appointment of 63yearold bohan would be a coup for 
silverman who led a consortium that rescued hartnell from the 
brink of bankruptcy in 1987 
for the past three years silverman has been looking for a 
topflight designer for hartnell 
bohan a star in the french fashion world was abruptly 
dismissed by dior in 1989 after 28 years in an inhouse coup that 
shook the industry he was replaced by italian designer gianfranco 
ferre 
during bohans years at dior the company expanded into luxury 
readytowear clothes for men and children it also sold licenses 
for accessories and household goods ranging from scarves to sheets 
when he left dior bohan took with him a fiercely loyal 
clientele including princess caroline of monaco 
the house of hartnell founded in 1924 by the late sir norman 
hartnell has a prestigious past which silverman has said he wants 
to revive 
a romantic designer who loved full skirts embroidery and 
sequins hartnell designed the wedding and coronation gowns of 
queen elizabeth ii and the floaty chiffons still worn by queen 
mother elizabeth his customers included the wealthy the titled 
and stars of the stage 
after his death in 1979 the fashion houses fortunes started to 
decline and in 1987 a courtappointed administrator was appointed 
to look for ways to refinance the company thats when silvermans 
consortium stepped in 
silverman tried out a number of british designers in an attempt 
to restore hartnells image before casting his eye to france 
the only other frenchborn designers to have had any lasting 
impact on british fashion are roland klein who set up business in 
london some 20 years ago and catherine walker of the chelsea 
design co a favorite of the princess of wales

presidentelect alberto fujimori has indicated 
he will probably support a usfunded antidrug plan his 
predecessor rejected 
in principle i consider the agreement useful and opportune 
for the fight against narcoterrorism fujimori who is to take 
office july 28 said thursday 
under the accord peru would receive 35 million in us 
military aid this year that includes 20 million for a training 
base near perus upper huallaga valley which is the worlds main 
source of coca leaf the raw material for cocaine 
at least a thousand maoist shining path guerrillas are believed 
to operate in the valley located on the eastern jungles of the 
andes 250 miles northeast of lima 
the rebels provide protection for drug traffickers in exchange 
for money and arms 
the military agreement has been strongly criticized by peruvian 
politicians who fear it will lead to direct us involvement in the 
countrys guerrilla war 
the outgoing president alan garcia refused to sign the 
military aid agreement demanding that the united states also 
provide other economic aid for the antidrug effort 
us and peruvian authorities already run an antidrug air base 
in the valley the training camp will likely be built at a 
preexisting peruvian military base in the jungle us embassy 
sources said an earlier plan to build the base in the valley was 
abandoned 
usperuvian military relations were restricted after leftist 
gen juan velasco alvarado led a coup in 1968 velasco forged close 
military ties with the soviet union and obtained large amounts of 
soviet arms and equipment 
more than 18500 people have died in political violence since 
the shining path begans its armed insurgency 10 years ago

secretary of state james a baker iii says 
international talks on german unification are not lagging behind 
the fast pace set by the two germanys 
another round of negotiations is scheduled today between the two 
germanys and the four world war ii allies that divided them the 
soviet union united states britain and france they are the 
socalled twoplusfour talks 
baker met thursday with east german foreign minister markus 
meckel to discuss the international aspects of unification just as 
the east german parliament voted overwhelmingly to merge the 
nations economy with west germanys 
west german lawmakers in the lower house of parliament approved 
the same accord thursday and upper house was expected to pass it 
today the treaty will result in de facto unification of the 
germanys on july 2 a full political merger is expected in the 
months ahead 
most of the major domestic issues of german unity are being 
resolved at a lightning pace while the superpowers remain at odds 
over the strategic role of a single germany 
baker responding to a question while speaking to reporters 
after the meeting with meckel denied that the international talks 
were being outpaced by domestic developments 
i think the talks are moving along quite expeditiously he 
said 
it is important in the view of the united states and some 
other countries that there not be a hiatus between the internal 
unification that is political and economic unification of the two 
germanys and a resolution on the external aspects of unification 
he said 
baker arrived in east berlin on thursday for separate talks with 
meckel and west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
before meeting with meckel baker was asked about meckels 
proposal for a joint warsaw pactnato summit on german unification 
it seems to me that that might do some violence to the concept 
of german sovereignity he said 
the meeting as i understand it was to consider whether or 
not germany should be a member of a particular alliance of course 
under the helsinki final act thats up to the sovereign states to 
make those determinations he said 
meckel said after the meeting that he was proposing that the 
sovietled warsaw pact and the north atlantic treaty organization 
hold a summit in the fall and sign a declaration that we are no 
longer enemies against each other 
meckel whose foreign policy pronouncements have sometimes 
differed from those of east german prime minister lothar de 
maiziere said his proposal was accepted as an idea by baker 
and that it would be discussed later 
the united states insists that a united germany be a member of 
nato which the soviet union opposes east germany is now in the 
warsaw pact and west germany is in nato 
meckel and baker spoke briefly to reporters after their 
90minute meeting 
he said he and meckel discussed the issues that will be dealt 
with by all six nations today such as the status of a unified 
berlin which is still technically under allied control 
but he reiterated that germany itself should alone decide which 
superpower alliance to join both german states favor nato 
membership

seventeen shrimp fishermen have been ordered 
to pay fines up to 12000 for failing to equip their nets with 
devices required under federal rules to protect sea turtles 
it was the first major decision on enforcement of the 
regulations requiring turtle excluder devices or teds 
hugh j dolan an administrative law judge in the department of 
commerce ruled the fishermen must pay the fines despite protests 
that the cagelike devices would cause them financial ruin 
those who conduct commercial fishing operations are obligated 
to know what the law and regulations are and to abide by them 
said dolan ruling from washington 
his ruling signed tuesday and released thursday upheld fines 
proposed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
three of the fishermen were fined 500 but most were fined 7500 
or 8000 the highest fine was 12000 
the shrimpers in the gulf of mexico could have settled out of 
court by installing teds but decided not to officials said most 
of the 17 fishermen are vietnamese immigrants 
the devices allow sea turtles to escape from shrimp nets 
fishermen complain teds let the shrimp escape also 
dolan said tee john mialjevich of new orleans head of concerned 
shrimpers inc who represented the fishermen misled the 17 
he assertedly told the shrimpers they did not have to obey the 
law and that no fines needed to be paid because the law was to be 
changed dolan wrote 
mialjevich would not comment thursday 
federal officials first ordered shrimpers to install teds in 
june 1987 but protests and legal fights delayed their use until 
the commerce secretary put regulations in full force in september 
1989 
joe gibson a spokesman for the coast guard said about 325 
citations for trawling without the devices were issued in 1989 and 
1990 records for this year show 218 of 373 vessels boarded by the 
coast guard had teds he said 
in washington marydele donnelly director of sea turtle 
programs at the center for marine conservation said this will 
go a long way to improving that situation 
in his decision dolan cited a new study on sea turtles by the 
national academy of sciences that recommended teds to save turtles 
the study said shrimp nets kill more turtles than all other human 
activity combined 
i am not unsympathetic to the plight of these hard working 
fishermen dolan said but he added that all gulf shrimp 
fishermen must abide by the laws enacted to protect endangered sea 
turtles

there was a time when the carefree boys of 
castro street loved life and each other with equal abandon then 
aids came and they had to change their ways or die 
many changed they practiced safer sex used condoms entered 
monogamous relationships many others died 
now researchers say some of those who changed are reverting to 
the highrisk sexual practices that spread the fatal disease they 
warned at the sixth international conference on aids thursday that 
the socalled relapse behavior by some gay and bisexual men 
could mean a second even more devastating wave of infection and 
death than the one that already has swept their community 
people changed because they were scared to death said 
maggie reinfeld of the gay mens health crisis in new york which 
has created the nations first program for confronting the relapse 
problem safer sex gets a lot tougher when you have to live with 
it over your whole life 
almost 20 percent of gay and bisexual men surveyed in san 
francisco had abandoned safer sex practices at least once 
according to studies by the center for aids prevention studies at 
the university of california san francisco 
ten years into the epidemic educators say they are facing a 
community increasingly weary from maintaining burdensome changes in 
their lifestyle a community grieving for the carefree days forever 
lost 
it isnt enough to say dont because no adult can live with 
dont for a whole lifetime especially when it comes to sex 
reinfeld said 
the american foundation for aids research has awarded 145000 
to communitybased aids groups to create a national relapse 
prevention network advertising campaigns in san francisco 
addressing relapse and a series of seminars in los angeles based on 
the gmhcs keep it up relapse workshops 
the percentage of gay and bisexual men consistently practicing 
safer sex has jumped from 316 in 1984 to 579 in 1988 researchers 
say but with an estimated 1 million hivinfected people in the 
united states today about 67 percent of them gay and bisexual men 
relapse to highrisk behaviors can have potentially devastating 
results 
no hiv educator can expect to change the basic behaviors that 
form our identity we can modify those behaviors to the extent that 
we can help people replace risky things with lessrisky things 
reinfeld said 
but when that involves sex replacement does not mean 
sanitizing behavior so its acceptable to the rest of the world it 
does mean helping people create satisfying alternatives 
alternatives that are hot sexy raunchy and sometimes shocking to 
the people outside the community 
educators say that its increasingly common for gay men to 
engage in risky sex binges practicing safe sex or celibacy for 
months at a time then spending one wild night of total abandon 
men at special risk of relapse include those in their 20s those in 
monogamous relationships and substance abusers 
its common to hear i got so drunk that whole story 
said gmhcs michael demayo who created the keep it up relapse 
program which has helped 1200 men in the last 10 months its 
used time and time again as an excuse to engage in behaviors that 
are remembered and longed for mourning for a whole way of life

eunice kiereini tells the story of three 
young african children born a year apart orphaned by aids and 
left to die in a small room by their relatives 
munkolenkole kamenga speaks of the 3yearold abandoned by his 
father in zaire after his mother died of aids at age 32 he was 
taken in by his grandmother already caring for six other children 
anne bayley recalls the words of the taxi driver one of 10 
children who has lost two brothers to aids they had seven 
children between them the driver has tested positive for the 
virus as has another sibling they have 16 children between them 
in africa where 80 percent of aids is spread through 
heterosexual contact and 50 percent of cases are in women of 
childbearing age more than a million uninfected children under 
the age of 10 have an hivinfected mother said medical specialists 
at the sixth international conference on aids 
that means that sometime in their lives they probably will 
become orphans a condition once unknown in most parts of africa 
because of the tradition of extended families aids has changed 
that 
now in some parts of africa other family members are already 
overwhelmed by children whose mothers and fathers have died from 
aids and cannot accept them said mrs kiereini chairwoman of 
the world health organization regional nursingmidwifery task force 
others will not accept even these noninfected children 
because of the false beliefs that these children will somehow cause 
them bad luck or even infect them with hiv orphans have therefore 
become a tragic african reality 
in african society women are expected to bear large numbers of 
children as well as grow crops collect water and cooking fuel and 
take surplus crops to village markets to sell when the mother 
dies the family often crumbles 
in a study of 468 children of hivinfected mothers over a 
threeyear period kamenga of project sida in kinshasa zaire 
reported thursday that 15 of 28 children orphaned in that time were 
not being cared for by their fathers more than 60 percent of the 
fathers either had died or abandoned their children after learning 
that the childs mother died of aids 
sida is the french acronym for aids hiv is the human 
immunodeficiency virus which causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
bayley who works with aids organizations in uganda said she 
hears the same story day after day

a 17yearold boy who testified he did bad 
things after repeated viewings of the movie a clockwork 
orange was convicted of fatally stabbing and strangling a friend 
in her back yard 
a jury watched about 50 minutes of the 1971 film before it 
convicted michale anderson on thursday of murdering 17yearold 
karen hurwitz last fall 
andersons attorney jon botula said anderson was incited to 
kill by numerous viewings of the movie which stars malcolm 
mcdowell as a marauding young briton with a vacant stare who acts 
on his violent impulses 
anderson told police he did bad things only while wearing a 
black clockwork orange tshirt he wore the shirt when the girl 
was stabbed six times in the sternum with a martial arts sword and 
strangled at her pittsburgh home 
i think theres a great deal of emotion attached to this case 
and a great deal of sympathy for the family botula said i 
think that entered into the verdict 
karens parents linda and dennis hurwitz left the allegheny 
county courtroom shortly after botula began showing the jury the 
movie which was directed by stanley kubrick and based on the 1962 
novel of the same name by anthony burgess 
you cant stand to think that your child has been so 
brutalized and someone who is the most gentle i mean she would 
not kill a spider in the house ms hurwitz said after the 
verdict was announced 
in the movie alex who is mcdowells character and his gang 
kill and rape at random on the streets of postmodern england alex 
eventually is caught by authorities who try to deprogram him 
the film was nominated for several academy awards but was 
denounced for extending the frontiers of screen violence in 1972 
kubrick withdrew the movie from british circulation because of 
death threats 
anderson faces a mandatory life sentence without parole botula 
said he will appeal 
ms hurwitz recalled seeing the movie while pregnant with karen 
i remember walking out afterwards so shaken saying to myself 
i hope im not bringing my child into a world with these kinds of 
people without any feeling or any emotion just plain brutality 
she said 
anderson who also was convicted of stealing the hurwitzs car 
after the killing still faces charges of stealing karens credit 
card and running up 600 in purchases prosecutor w christopher 
conrad said 
common pleas judge robert dauer revoked andersons bond and 
ordered him to appear aug 23 for sentencing 
anderson has been held at a juvenile detention center since his 
arrest

nelson mandela says he supports plo leader 
yasser arafat libyan col moammar gadhafi and cuban president 
fidel castro because they have helped south africas blacks fight 
for human rights 
one of the mistakes that the outside world makes is to think 
that their enemies should be our enemies mandela said thursday 
during the taping of a television special our attitude toward 
any country is determined by the attitude of that country toward 
our struggle 
on the second day of his us trip the leader of the african 
national congress faced questions at a town meeting attended by 
1000 invited guests on the city college of new york campus ted 
koppel moderator of abcs nightline was host for the hourlong 
program broadcast later thursday 
also on thursday interviewed by new york times editors and 
writers mandela said the anc wasnt committed to socialism as the 
only way to redress the economic disparities between south africas 
whites and blacks 
we are not looking at any particular model mandela said 
as far as economic policy is concerned our sole concern is that 
the inequalities which are to be found in the economy should be 
redressed 
in his first speech after he was released in february mandela 
called for a fundamental restructuring of his countrys 
economy the anc has long supported nationalization of important 
industries 
mandela however told the times if anybody can indicate to 
us that there are other options which will enable us to rectify 
this imbalance we will certainly look at that option and the 
question of nationalization for us will not be an option at all 
at the town meeting taping the handpicked overwhelmingly 
promandela audience often erupted into cheers when mandela 
responded firmly sometimes with biting sarcasm to questions about 
his political and economic views 
kenneth adelman former director of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency under president reagan asked mandela why he 
embraced arafat gadhafi and castro leaders the united states 
accuses of supporting or encouraging international terrorism 
yasser arafat colonel gadhafi fidel castro support our 
struggle to the hilt said mandela there is no reason 
whatsoever why we should have any hesitation about their commitment 
to human rights in south africa they are placing resources at our 
disposal to win the struggle 
at another point he described arafat as a comrade in arms 
and we will treat him as such 
koppel cautioned mandela not to be misled by a hometown 
crowd and said his views would not be well received by other 
americans especially jews and might imperil congressional support 
for sustaining economic sanctions against south africa 
mandela said his organization sympathizes with the struggle of 
the jewish people down the years and recalled that jewish lawyers 
were the first to defend him and his anc colleagues arrested for 
resisting the minority regime in south africa 
that does not mean that the enemies of israel are our enemies 
anyone who changes his principles depending on who he is dealing 
with is not a man who can lead a nation mandela said 
mandela also warned that efforts by western countries such as 
the united states to help south african president fw de klerks 
reform program will have the opposite effect by driving white 
south africans toward the countrys racist right wing 
please whatever you do dont do that he said you are 
playing with fire if you think of rewarding mr de klerk because 
you will undermine his position

the changing terminology of aids does more 
than shape the way people talk about the disease experts say it 
shapes everyones way of thinking about and responding to the 
epidemic 
activists at the sixth international conference on aids this 
week are so sensitive to some words and phrases they distributed a 
buzzword flyer it spells out why speakers at the meeting 
which began wednesday and continues today run the risk of being 
booed if they use politically incorrect words 
among the taboo phrases are highrisk groups innocent 
victims and intimate sexual contact 
the evolving terminology of aids is based on the idea that 
language is political said robin lakoff a linguistic professor at 
the university of california at berkeley 
in the last 30 years people have become more sensitive about 
the language they use and about the language used about them she 
said 
disempowered groups will change the language about them to gain 
respect and authority she said the civil rights movement 
effectively changed negro to black and the womens 
movement changed lady to woman for that reason 
aids workers prefer highrisk behavior to highrisk 
groups because actions such as sharing drug needles spread aids 
not mere membership in a group such as intravenous drug users 
language change may start out as a psychological factor for 
empowerment lakoff said but it has very real consequences the 
way you think can change your behavior 
calling an infant an innocent victim of aids is considered 
very impolitic aids workers say because it implies other people 
living with aids somehow deserve it and should feel guilty about 
contracting the disease 
aids workers also say people are not aids victims they are 
people with aids or more recently people living with 
aids to call people victims strips them of dignity workers 
say 
dr david wilkins an associate professor of linguistics at the 
university of california at davis said he has found evidence of a 
skewed terminology prompting ignorance about a subject 
in wordassociation tests using aids as a prompt word 
wilkins said his students responded with such words as death 
gay fear homosexual 
people learn the words wilkins said but they use the 
words to convey these associations not what the words actually 
mean 
aids educators are rankled by terms they find too vague such as 
bodily fluids semen vaginal fluids and blood are known to 
transmit the human immunodeficiency virus hiv but not tears 
sweat and saliva 
similarly intimate sexual contact makes some people think of 
kissing and fondling aids activists say the media should name 
specific acts of sexual intercourse in discussions of highrisk 
behavior 
using specific language instead of polite euphemisms and using 
nonjudgmental language was crucial in this citys attempts to 
treat the disease said rene durazzo of the san francisco aids 
foundation 
one of the reasons we have been able to be successful is that 
we have been able to stress behavior without pointing fingers 
durazzo said if the language seems to be judgmental you start 
to alienate the very people you want to reach 
recently durazzo named one of the most important changes in the 
aids language as being the shift to discussing hiv as a critical 
problem not just aids 
rather than calling hiv the aids virus durazzo prefers that 
aids be portrayed as the most acute stage of infection with hiv 
there was a misconception that people who were infected but 
didnt show it were well durazzo said with the increased focus 
on hiv durazzo said funding and awareness of early intervention 
programs has increased significantly

crews aboard the fireravaged mega borg 
are continuing to transfer millions of gallons of oil from the ship 
onto other vessels and expect the process to be finished by next 
week 
the tedious transfer known as lightering began wednesday 
night it had been delayed for a few days so salvage crews could 
test the stability of the 886foot norwegian tanker which was 
rocked by an explosion june 8 while transferring oil to another 
ship 
the transfer is being done using portable pumps because the mega 
borgs pump room was destroyed in the fire following the explosion 
coast guard chief petty officer jerry snyder said thursday 
the lightering is going well he said they boosted their 
maximum output to 9600 barrels per hour its continuing right on 
schedule and we expect to fill the motor vessel janus by saturday 
and then start transferring the cargo onto the motor vessel 
atlantis 
unless there are complications the entire transfer should be 
completed by monday snyder said 
crews already have removed 13 million barrels of oil off the 
crippled mega borg anchored 57 some miles from galveston he said 
late thursday 
the tankers remaining cargo estimated at 34 million gallons 
will be taken to terminals in texas city and houston in two trips 
said robert klawetter an attorney for the mega borgs owners no 
decision has been made on whether the super tanker will be scrapped 
or salvaged he said 
coast guard officials said 39 million gallons of oil leaked 
from the tanker most of it either burned evaporated or has been 
skimmed from the water 
an oil slick once 30 miles long that resulted from the 
explosion is continuing to dissipate into a series of patches 
offshore coast guard officials said they could not predict where 
tar balls may wash ashore raising the possibility that much of the 
remaining oil spill may never reach the beach 
its out there and heading further out snyder said its 
about 18 miles offshore and not well defined at all its breaking 
up because of a 3 to 4foot chop 
if the oil patches start to move they probably would wash 
ashore somewhere along a 47mile stretch of beach between high 
island and sabine pass the coast guard predicted high island is 
about 30 miles northeast of galveston and sabine pass is farther 
up the coast at the louisiana border 
there have been no reports of tar balls from the mega borg 
reaching texas beaches earlier this week volunteers helped clean 
beaches of debris in an effort to make any later cleanup of oil 
easier 
the cause of the mega borg blast has not been determined two 
crew members died and two others are missing and presumed dead

dr vera adler head of the health ministrys public health 
department told israel radio that the department initially asked 
that more chlorine be added to the water 
but she said we still got contaminated water even with 
increased chlorination 
the water for the coastal region is drawn from the sea of 
galilee and piped to tel aviv via the national water carrier 
mekorot a mekorot official said the water leaving the galilee was 
pure and that it was being contaminated within the tel aviv 
regions water system 
health officials said this could be the result of algae in the

states 
us district judge john f keenan on thursday rejected motions 
by the defense to dismiss all charges defense lawyers routinely 
request dismissal after prosecutors rest their case arguing they 
failed to prove the charges 
but keenan repeated earlier puzzlement about why the case was 
tried in the united states because much of the alleged illegal 
activity took place in the philippines

former philippines president ferdinand marcos looted their 
countrys treasury of 222 million during their 20 years in power 
investing some of the money in four new york office buildings 
jewelry and art works 
codefendant adnan khashoggi a 54yearold saudi arabian 
financier is accused of faking documents to help the marcoses 
conceal their ownership of the real estate and some paintings after 
a us court order froze their assets following their ouster from 
power in february 1986 
if convicted of mail fraud and obstruction of justice he could 
be sentenced to 10 years in prison and 500000 in fines

the newspaper quoted smith as saying the plot also called for 
killing south african communist party leader joe slovo minister of 
law and order adriaan vlok minister of foreign affairs pik botha

some prominent staff members of the governmentrun south african 
broadcasting corp television station were also on the hit list 
the report said 
in london south african archbishop desmond tutu said the 
governments leniency toward rightwing groups created the climate 
for racist assassination plots 
weve always said the government was not coming down 
sufficiently strongly on the right wing and there have been very 
many incidents in the past which just seem to baffle the police 
tutu said in an interview with sky tv during a visit to britain 
de klerks government this year freed mandela from 27 years in 
prison has begun dismantling apartheid laws and lifted repressive 
state of emergency measures in most of the country

personal income edged up 03 percent in may 
for the second straight month but personal spending was unchanged 
from the previous month the government said today in another sign 
of consumer caution 
consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health 
since it accounts for about twothirds of the nations economic 
activity 
the commerce department reported that incomes totaled a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 470 trillion the 03 percent 
gains followed three consecutive monthly advances of 08 percent 
and were the lowest since a 02 percent increase last september 
consumer spending remained unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 366 trillion after seven straight months of gains 
including 05 percent in april and 03 percent in march but even 
the april and march advances were weaker than first thought they 
were revised downward from 06 percent and 05 percent reported 
last month 
todays report follows other signs of consumer weakness 
including three consecutive monthly declines in retail sales 
through may it was the first time retail sales had dropped three 
months in a row since the summer of 1981 during the last recession 
nevertheless the difference helped improve americans savings 
rate the rate savings as a percent of disposable income rose 
to 62 percent following a 60 percent rate in april and a 63 
percent rate in march the march rate was the highest in five years 
a higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital 
since funds thus would be available domestically for business 
investment 
the report said americans income after taxes increased 02 
percent the same rate as in april 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
rose 103 billion after a 164 billion gain the previous month 
on the spending side purchases of durable goods products 
expected to last at lest three years fell 126 billion after a 
85 billion gain in april but durable goods purchases had fallen 
the previous two months 
purchases of nondurable goods were down 500 million in may 
their third consecutive decline spending on services slowed to 
131 billion after a 147 billion gain in april and a 196 
billion advance a month earlier

avianca pilots were not trained to use the 
term fuel emergency but common sense should have told air 
traffic controllers that an avianca jet was in trouble the night it 
crashed an avianca pilot testified 
avianca capt saul pertuz who testified thursday said the 
controllers argument that the flight crew in januarys fatal crash 
failed to use the right term was equal to demanding prescribed 
phrases and leaving the common sense out of expressing an 
emergency 
the national transportation safety board is holding a hearing in 
this town on new yorks long island to determine how communications 
broke down between controllers and the crew of the avianca plane 
that crashed on long island in january leaving 73 people dead 
tapes of conversations between air traffic controllers and the 
crew of the avianca flight show that the pilots while saying they 
were low on fuel and wanted to land did not use the term fuel 
emergency 
consequently according to controllers who testified the plane 
received no priority to land that night 
the term fuel emergency is a standard american term but is 
not always standard among international airlines the federal 
aviation administration issued a bulletin shortly after the 
accident warning both pilots and controllers about the need to use 
the specific terms

a fuel barge and a fishing boat collided 
today in the morning fog spilling less than 1000 gallons of 
gasoline into the ocean off of rhode island authorities said 
gasoline poured from a 6inch crack in the barge st85 about two 
hours as the fuel was transferred to another tank said petty 
officer paul gerecke of the marine safety office in providence 
its not another world prodigy he said referring to the 
oil tanker that caused the states worst oil spill last year 
it was a year ago saturday that the world prodigy ran aground 
off newport releasing 289000 gallons of home heating oil into 
rhode island sound 
estimates of the amount of gasoline discharged into block island 
sound this morning were not immediately available but at worst it 
was 1000 gallons said gerecke 
when youre dealing with a sunny day like this and gasoline 
its gone almost immediately its gone as soon as it leaks out 
said gerecke 
in addition the tide was heading out to sea and away from the 
beaches 
the crack was about two feet above the water line of the 
360foot barge he said the barge had a total cargo of 84000 
barrels or 35 million gallons but only 1000 gallons of gasoline 
was above the crack he said 
the collision occurred about four miles south of weekapaug 
point midway between the galilee section of narragansett and the 
watch hill area of westerly he said it is about 10 miles from the 
spot where the world prodigy ran aground on brenton reef 
the fishing boat and barge rammed shortly before 7 am when 
there was zero visibility said coast guard petty officer dave 
brear

the barge which is owned by the tug new york co out of

as much as 40 percent of a special tax benefit 
for lowincome families with children is being claimed by 
ineligible persons the internal revenue service estimated today 
as part of its audit program the irs found that in 1985 818 
million of the total 21 billion earnedincome credit went to 
those who were found to be ineligible credits totaling 6 billion 
are expected to be claimed this year by more than 10 million 
working families 
the credit has strong support in both political parties 
president bush has supported increases in the credit and both 
houses of congress have agreed to boost the benefit as part of 
rival childcare bills congressional leaders say the new irs study 
clouds those efforts 
steve pyrek an irs spokesman said the 40 percent error rate 
first reported by the washington post is accurate but pointed out 
that the estimate is based on a very limited sample of tax returns 
the credit is an area where there are lots of errors in 
computation because it is a very complex calculation pyrek said 
the credit was enacted in 1975 to reward lowincome workers who 
hold a job rather than relying solely on welfare benefits at that 
time the credit was viewed as basically an offset against social 
security taxes 
for 1990 the credit is for 14 percent of the first 6810 of 
wages and other earned income a maximum benefit of 953 the 
credit drops as wages rise and is eliminated once income reaches 
20264 
a qualifying family that owes no federal income tax can get a 
check from the government for up to 953 the credit may be paid in 
advance throughout the year through increased takehome pay or 
claimed when a tax return is filed the following year

the us fish and wildlife service today 
declared the rare northern spotted owl to be a threatened species 
but held up a specific plan for protection out of concern for 
thousands of logging jobs in the northwest 
the biological evidence says the northern spotted owl is in 
trouble john turner head of the fish and wildlife service said 
in announcing the owl will be protected under the endangered 
species act effective july 23 we will not and cannot by law 
ignore that decision 
designation as a threatened species would make it illegal to 
harm any of the owls or destroy their critical habitat without 
federal government approval 
an estimated 3000 to 5000 pairs of spotted owl survive in the 
ancient forests of washington oregon and northern california an 
interior department study has estimated that protecting the owl 
would curtail logging over millions of acres and cost as many as 
28000 logging jobs over the next decade 
i strongly believe there is room in the world for both owls 
and loggers turner told reporters 
our intent now in the fish and wildlife service and throughout 
the administration is to find a way to protect the owl with the 
least possible disruption of the timber economy of the northwest 
turner said 
turner said it was a difficult and painful decision both for 
the agency and me personally 
we remain convinced the northwest can accommodate both logging 
and owls ralph morgenweck of the fish and wildlife service told 
members of congress earlier 
the formal protection plan wouldnt be released until next week 
this issue is so complex it involves such a vast area that the 
consequences could be harsh therefore this decision on a 
management plan couldnt be made without taking into consideration 
its impact said interior spokesman mark stephenson 
a committee led by forest service biologist jack ward thomas 
announced in april that the northern spotted owl has lost about 
twothirds of its habitat since 1800 the panel recommended more 
than 3 million acres of previously unprotected forests an area 
nearly as large as connecticut be set aside to preserve owl 
habitat 
the endangered species act was passed in 1973 and has been used 
to provide protection to the bald eagle and grizzly bear among 
other animals 
under the law a designation of a threatened species means it is 
likely to become extinct without protection whereas extinction is 
viewed as a certainty for an endangered species 
the announcement comes on the heels of a declaration by 
government scientists in april that the rare owl is likely to 
become extinct unless millions of acres of habitat are created the 
owls natural habitat is in the northwests oldest forests 
environmentalists have billed the decision as an important 
precedent in a larger fight over protection of the forests because 
the forest service earlier decided the health of the owl is a good 
indicator of the overall condition of the forests themselves 
under one draft protection plan the timber harvests permitted 
on federal lands in the northwest would be cut nearly in half and 
cost the region 28000 direct timberbased jobs 
industry leaders predict a much greater impact rep denny 
smith rore estimates a rippling effect in the economy could 
touch as many as 75000 workers 
forest service chief f dale robertson lawmakers and industry 
leaders have said implementation of the biological plan would carry 
effects unprecedented under the endangered species act 
weve worked with endangered species before but weve never 
worked through something this huge with such high stakes and such a 
high volume business robertson said recently 
environmentalists argue that job loss in the timber industry is 
more the result of automation than forest protection 
the general accounting office an investigative arm of congress 
predicted in april that national timber harvests will increase 55 
percent over the next halfcentury while industry employment will 
fall about 27 percent as wood mills are modernized 
two years ago the fish and wildlife service decided against 
declaring the owl as threatened however amid accusations of 
highlevel tampering in the reagan administration a federal judge 
ordered the agency to review the owls status 
the endangered species act applies to private as well as public 
lands but the vast majority of the owls live on the federally 
owned lands of the forest service and the bureau of land management 
robertson has said his agency intends to implement most of the 
thomas report which would designate owl habitat conservation areas 
throughout the pacific northwest 
but blm citing the effect on the timberbased economies of 
oregon is pursuing alternatives that would lock up less land

president vaclav havels political 
movement and its sister ally today formed the nations first freely 
elected noncommunist government in four decades 
the state ctk news agency reported that the agreement was 
reached at talks in the slovak capital bratislava participants 
were havel prime minister designate marian calfa and 
representatives of the civic forum its sister movement public 
against violence the christian democratic movement and the 
democratic party 
the civic forum and public against violence which led the 
peaceful revolution that ousted the communists from power last 
november won 170 seats in the 300seat parliament in june 89 
elections 
the incumbent government also headed by calfa will resign next 
wednesday and the new government will be appointed by havel ctk 
said 
agreement came two days after the christian democratic movement 
which had first refused to join the new government returned to 
coalition talks 
ctk did not give any names of ministers in the new 16member 
cabinet and did not say how the ministries were distributed among 
the parties 
informed sources in prague indicated earlier this week that four 
portfolios were being considered for the christian democrats 
it was unclear whether the democratic party which only won 
seats in the slovak regional parliament was to be included in the 
government or was only present at the talks today 
a christian democratic alliance of three loosely allied parties 
won 40 seats in the elections coming in third behind the 
communists with 47 the christian democratic movement of jan 
carnogursky a former dissident like havel and incumbent 
vicepremier is the largest in the christian democratic union 
the christian democratic movement returned to the coalition 
talks after its leadership reversed carnogurskys earlier decision 
to boycott them a civic forum official said wednesday 
civic forum and public against violence could have formed a 
minority goverment but would have lacked the necessary threefifths 
majority needed in both chambers to push through key constitutional 
changes 
officials from both groups had repeatedly stated they sought the 
broadest possible coalition as the country embarks on a transition 
to a market economy which will require drastic economic reform

soldiers from three nations locked the doors 
of checkpoint charlie today and a crane whisked away the cold war 
relic that symbolized a divided world 
a us army band played a stirring song about old berlin as the 
rectangular white sentry station a place east germans died trying 
to reach was hoisted onto a truck for its passage into history 
the famed allied checkpoint by the berlin wall was closed with 
an elaborate ceremony that brought together the top diplomats from 
the germanys and the four world war ii allies 
for 29 years checkpoint charlie embodied the cold war us 
secretary of state james a baker iii told a crowd of invited 
guests and journalists on berlins friedrich street 
and now 29 years after it was built we meet here today to 
dismantle it and to bury the conflicts it created 
baker soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and the 
foreign ministers from france britain and the two germanys each 
heralded the end of the checkpoint as a symbol of change 
shevardnadze called for the removal of berlins status as an 
alliedcontrolled city and the withdrawal of troops within six 
months after the two german states unify which could come in 
december 
the proposal as translated into english by the soviets and 
distributed later to news media apparently would also include the 
kremlins soldiers stationed just outside the city proper the 
united states france and great britain have an estimated 12000 
troops in west berlin 
berlin has been split into soviet us british and france 
sectors and west berlin remains technically separate from west 
germany 
the german and allied foreign ministers are meeting in east 
berlin to discuss the status of the city and a united germanys 
role in world affairs 
all borders are to be opened between the berlins and the 
germanys by july 2 when the nations merge their economies 
large sections of the berlin wall are being dismantled daily 
and us officials decided to time the removal of checkpoint 
charlie with the foreign ministers meeting 
a color guard of french british and american soldiers strode to 
the building and locked the doors leading to each allied nations 
compartment in the checkpoint 
the giant crane then lifted the boxlike building high into the 
air us army spokesman sgt ed mccarthy said he believes it is 
destined for a museum 
checkpoint charlie stood just 20 yards from an east german 
checkpoint and was the only place between the berlins that could be 
crossed on foot by nongermans 
the ceremony was closed to the public but not to the residents 
of the buildings that line friedrich street which had been divided 
by the berlin wall since 1961 
illa wobig leaned out her window and watched the ceremony unfold 
just 20 yards below the fourthfloor apartment where she has lived 
for 24 years 
i saw eight people shot to death on that street she said 
i saw an east german officer try to go under a guard rail he was 
shot in the neck 
she said she also saw at least 20 successful escapes by tunnel 
car and on foot 
i saw kennedy reagan and carter give speeches here she 
said i saw a james bond movie filmed here this is wonderful for 
history but it is sad for me it was part of my home 
east german construction worker andreas bratke was working near 
the wall in january 1986 when he suddenly bolted through the east 
german checkpoint down friedrich street and through checkpoint 
charlie 
i ran as fast as i could he said from his home in west 
berlin checkpoint charlie is a very important place to me

the soviet union has begun removing nuclear 
warheads from some of its more volatile republics out of concern 
that the weapons may fall into the hands of nationalist elements 
an administration official said today 
its the prudent thing to do said the official alluding to 
the upheavals that have occurred in the baltic region and in other 
areas in the southeastern part of the country the official asked 
not to be identified 
stephen meyer an expert on the soviet military and a professor 
at the massachusetts institute of technology said soviet 
government officials told him of the consolidation 
there is a consolidation going on he said adding it 
appears the soviets may also be concerned that warheads from a site 
in a rebellious republic could be handed over to iran or another 
third world country 
the wall street journal which reported the story in todays 
editions said the soviets have told american officials and experts 
that they have consolidated control over 33000 nuclear warheads 
the state department had no comment on the report 
the article said one soviet concern is the possibility of a 
breakdown of central authority in the country followed by civil war 
a second concern involves the possible theft of nuclear weapons 
in the event that a soviet storage site were overrun by rebel 
forces it said 
at the soviet embassy in washington spokesman georgi v 
shchekochikhin said he had no information that warheads had been 
moved he referred questions to the soviet foreign ministry 
the journal article said the effort appears to focus on bringing 
tactical nuclear weapons such as shortrange missiles nuclear 
artillery and bombs into the russian republic 
it added that the move is not believed to include longrange 
strategic nuclear weapons and therefore does not constitute a 
change in the superpower balance of forces 
meyer said it seemed from his conversations with soviet 
officials that the consolidation began after violence flared last 
january between armed azerbaijani and armenian groups around the 
city of baku where some nuclear warheads are believed to be 
stored moscow sent russian airborne units to stop the fighting 
but isolated attacks on military units in that area reportedly have 
continued 
meyer said the consolidation involves both nuclear warheads and 
conventional or nonnuclear armaments he equated the move with a 
us decision in the 1970s to sharply reduce the number of nuclear 
warhead storage sites in western europe in response to a rise in 
terrorist threats against us installations

iranian workers using police dogs today 
rescued thousands of people buried under the rubble of their homes 
by an earthquake that killed about 29000 people official media 
reported 
in geneva a un relief official said the iranian foreign 
ministry had told un officials that 35000 people were killed 
at least 100 aftershocks continued to rattle the northern region 
near the caspian sea shaking the capital tehran and causing new 
landslides that trapped trucks carrying relief supplies 
but a fleet of rescue helicopters and planes got through to 
areas cut off by thursdays quake the planes brought tons of 
supplies and carried out thousands of survivors 
the earthquake measured at least 73 on the richter scale and 
struck at 1230 am while most iranians were asleep the temblor 
was centered 125 miles northwest of tehran 
the official islamic republic news agency said relief officials 
had compiled a list of 28950 dead and 28198 injured the iranian 
mission to the united nations released a death toll of 25000 and 
said the count would likely rise as rescuers reached more remote 
areas 
fabrizio gentiloni of un disaster relief coordinators office 
in geneva said the iranians told un officials in tehran that an 
estimated 35000 people were killed more than 100000 injured 
most of the deaths were in two northern farming provinces gilan 
and zanjan which have a combined population of 27 million irna 
said with more than 25000 people killed in coastal gilan alone 
telephone lines electricity and water supplies were cut in the 
provinces 
the international red cross said in geneva that radio reports 
from the red crescent of iran indicated that at least 400000 were 
left homeless 
iranian authorities did not immediately allow foreignbased 
reporters to enter iran to cover the disaster 
rescuers began using dogs today to search for survivors and 
victims trapped beneath the mountains of debris irna monitored in 
nicosia quoted an air force commander as saying the use of police 
dogs yielded good results 
the commander identified only as gen naderian said 6000 
victims many injured but alive were dug out and airlifted from 
gilan and zanjan provinces to hospitals in other cities 
he said rain and poor visibility grounded some relief aircraft 
but they began getting through today irna said 10 c131 transport 
planes and 30 chinook helicopters helped evacuate victims after the 
weather had improved 
more than 3000 tons of relief supplies have been flown to the 
region in 50 trips by air force transport planes naderian said 
officials pleaded for blood blankets and medicine and other 
countries promised to send supplies an iranian health official 
said today there was no need for foreign blood because of 
donations from iranians 
but he said hospitals needed surgical thread blood bags 
orthopedic surgical equipment medicines tents sheets and 
blankets 
scenes on government tv showed young men desperately digging at 
debris from flattened concrete buildings in rasht 175 miles 
northwest of tehran with a population of 189000 people 
bulldozers and cranes lifted away larger pieces of debris 
bulldozers also tried to clear roads for ambulances and other 
rescue vehicles 
tehran television monitored in cyprus showed masked rescuers 
in white aprons pulling dustcovered bodies from under concrete 
slabs the corpses were laid on blocks of ice in open trucks 
apparently to keep them from decomposing 
a dam south of rasht burst flooding the surrounding area irna 
said 
frightened survivors spent the night outdoors afraid to go 
home in quakedevastated towns women in black chadors flanked by 
weeping children camped out in public squares 
the tv showed villages in which 90 percent of the buildings were 
destroyed in one an entire row of houses collapsed and slipped 
down a hillside in tehran crowds gathered in collection centers 
donating blankets food kerosene heaters and fistfuls of cash 
in the village of abdar in zanjan televison showed mountains 
of rubble and a speaker said it was all that was left of apartment 
buildings they appeared to have been shaken off their foundations 
collapsing like a deck of cards 
the camera zoomed in on a stuffed toy rabbit and a childs shoe 
lying in a street carpeted with dust 
irna said at least 1000 people were killed in abdar alone 
the region is vulnerable to earthquakes because many homes are 
built on flood plains of loosely deposited soil that shifts 
violently in a quake the primary construction materials are 
ceramic bricks and unreinforced concrete both of which crumble 
easily 
irans spiritual leader ali khamenei called the disaster a 
divine test and urged the bereaved residents of the stricken 
provinces to pass this test with pride through patience and 
cooperation 
khamenei and president hashemi rafsanjani flew to the area to 
supervise relief operations rafsanjani declared three days of 
mourning 
the iranian cabinet met in emergency session and called the 
quake a sad painful and horrible tragedy it placed all 
government organizations on full alert 
offers of help poured in from around the world japan said today 
it would send a rescue team and 500000 in emergency aid the 
european community promised 12 million in emergency relief and 
the united states offered humanitarian assistance even iraq one 
of irans most bitter enemies offered condolences and aid 
president bush sent a message of condolence to rafsanjani along 
with the us offer of assistance it was delivered to iran by an 
unidentified country because the united states does not have 
diplomatic relations with tehran 
the earthquake was the worst since a quake registering 77 on 
the richter scale struck iran on sept 16 1978 killing 25000 
people on dec 7 1988 roughly the same number of people died in 
a quake in nearby soviet armenia that registered 69 on the richter 
scale of ground motion 
thursdays temblor measured 73 on the richter scale the 
geophysics center at tehran university said the us geological 
survey however measured it at 77 
the richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude a reading of 7 on the scale indicates a major 
earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage

death there wednesday arab witnesses said 
officials at east jerusalems mukassed hospital said police shot 
zuhri ibrahim shuweiki 17 in the head police spokesman uzi 
sandori confirmed only that a 17yearold youth arrived dead at a 
hospital after mass demonstrations in the hilly silwan quarter 
it is most likely he was shot by police officers sandori 
added 
he said the area was placed under curfew confining its 8300 
residents to their homes 
israel radio said riots in silwan began when hundreds of masked 
palestinian activists armed with metal bars and stones attacked a 
police jeep it said police opened fire with live ammunition after 
the arabs got dangerously close 
after the curfew on silwan was declared many police officers 
were seen advancing in the streets using smoke grenades the radio 
said 
one of the injured at mukassed who gave his name as mohammed 
said the protesters were throwing stones at every police car 
angry protesters took shuweikis body to a funeral in silwan 
and about 1000 palestinians later marched in the village streets 
carrying outlawed palestinian flags groups of protesters continued 
to throw stones at policemen mohammed said 
it was the most violent demonstration in silwan since the 
uprising began he said everybody was in the streets men 
women and children 
shuweiki was the second palestinian to be shot to death by 
border police this week and the eighth to be killed in jerusalem 
during the 30month revolt against israeli occupation 
at least six israelis have been slain in jerusalem during the 
uprising and 719 palestinians have been killed by israeli 
soldiers police or civilians fortyfive israelis have been slain 
by palestinians also about 225 palestinians have been slain by 
fellow arabs most on charges they collaborated with israeli 
authorities 
curfews in east jerusalem are rare because they violate israeli 
policy that jerusalem is a united sovereign city the measure is 
opposed by mayor teddy kollek 
east jerusalem was captured from jordan along with the west bank 
in the 1967 middle east war israel annexed the area but most 
western nations including the united states do not recognize the 
action palestinians want east jerusalem to be the capital of their 
independent state 
silwan where shuweiki was killed is an arab village that was 
annexed along with east jerusalem

lawyers tried today to persuade a federal 
judge to call off the execution of black widow killer judi 
buenoano claiming floridas electric chair can malfunction and 
torture her to death 
us district judge patricia fawsett who granted ms buenoano a 
temporary stay of execution thursday heard more testimony today on 
her appeal based largely on a malfunction that shot flames above 
the head of the last executed inmate 
ms buenoano 47 was sentenced to death for the fatal arsenic 
poisoning of her husband she also was convicted of drowning her 
paralyzed teenage son and trying to kill a boyfriend in a car 
bombing 
ronald thornton maintenance supervisor at florida state prison 
testified today that the prison has no specific test to detect a 
faulty or damaged head electrode saying the electrode was visually 
inspected after the last execution 
thornton said an attempt to energize the electrical system 
on the monday after the execution of jesse tafero on may 4 resulted 
in a power failure in the part of the prison that includes the 
death chamber 
a check showed a break in one of the feeder cables to the system 
that thornton said was old but he testified that this had 
nothing to do with the tafero execution 
prison superintendent thomas l martin jr said the last 
execution made it abundantly clear to everybody that we had a 
problem we hadnt had before but he said a wet sponge on 
taferos head the states explanation for the malfunction was 
the only thing that could have gone wrong 
fred a leuchter jr who designs and manufactures execution 
systems and hardware said that a faulty electrode caused sparks 
flames and smoke at taferos head 
leuchter and ms buenoanos lawyer jay nickerson contended 
that tafero had suffered cruel and needless torture before he died 
and the problem had not been corrected 
fawsett ordered a temporary halt to thursdays scheduled 1201 
pm execution about four hours before ms buenoano was to die 
the florida supreme court on wednesday rejected similar claims 
that an electrode in the electric chair was broken during the 
tafero electrocution 
the state argued that the smoke and flame around taferos head 
was caused by a synthetic sponge attached to the electrode it has 
been replaced and everything is in working order for the next 
execution the department of corrections has said 
assistant attorney general margene roper on thursday repeated 
contentions by prison officials that tafero did not suffer and was 
dead after the first of three surges of electricity 
leuchter called floridas chair a makeshift device poorly made 
and maintained 
he said corrosion or a break in an electrode resulted in a 
nonlethal charge that did not kill tafero until he was jolted 
three times over a period of several minutes 
one woman has been executed in the united states since the 
supreme court lifted its ban on capital punishment in 1976 north 
carolina killed velma barfield by lethal injection in 1984 for 
poisoning her boyfriend 
ms buenoano was condemned to death for the slaying of air force 
sgt james e goodyear in orlando in 1971 
she also was convicted of killing her paralyzed son michael 
goodyear 19 by pushing him from a canoe in a 1980 outing and of 
attempted murder in a car bombing that injured her boyfriend john 
gentry in 1983

the soviet union said today that a united 
germany can join nato after a fiveyear transition period during 
which all soviet and us troops would leave the country the 
united states rejected the proposal a us official said 
the proposal was outlined by soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze during international talks in east berlin on the 
strategic future of a united germany 
the remarks a copy of which were obtained by the associated 
press indicates that a united germany would be free to join the 
western nato alliance after a fiveyear transitional period 
but in exchange western and soviet troops would pull out of the 
country and germanys own military strength would be sharply 
reduced according to the proposal 
shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with us secretary of 
state james a baker iii and their counterparts from britain 
france and the two german states 
i am underwhelmed baker said when asked about the soviet 
proposal while posing for pictures with the other foreign ministers 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said us 
officials objected to the fiveyear time limit before germany could 
join nato the official said the other western ministers expressed 
the same reservations 
the united states wants a united germany to be a member of the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the soviet union has been 
staunchly opposed 
west germany now is a mainstay of nato and east germany is a 
member of the sovietled warsaw pact 
shevardnadze said the soviet proposal seeks to limit the 
strength of the german armed forces and to revamp their structure 
to make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensive 
operations 
it said those reductions could be undertaken over a threeyear 
period germany also would be prevented from producing or deploying 
chemmical or nuclear weapons 
it also said that within six months of unification all western 
troops should leave west berlin which remains technically under 
military occupation by the united states france and britian 
the four nations would reduce their military forces in the 
country during a threeyear period following unification first by 
50 percent then bring them down to a level of token contingents 
or completely withdraw them from germany 
there are about 380000 soviet troops in east germany while a 
quartermillion us troops are stationed in west germany along 
with tens of thousands of british and french soldiers 
previously the soviets had said their troops would stay in what 
is now east germany for several years but had left unclear the 
exact plans for pulling them out 
shevardnadze speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of 
the western allies checkpoint charlie said he wanted the big four 
powers troops out of greater berlin within six months after 
unification 
the proposal as translated into english by the soviets and 
distributed to the news media apparently would also include the 
kremlins soldiers stationed just outside the city proper 
the united states france and great britain have an estimated 
12000 troops in west berlin an official reached by telephone in 
the office of the military attache at the soviet embassy in east 
berlin said there were no soviet troops stationed in the city 
proper

from her window virginia spence can see 
the road to the nursing home where she may have to move if 
officials close the shenandoah county farm the last countyrun 
poorhouse in virginia 
the farm where ms spence came to live in 59 years ago during 
the great depression is an anachronism a quaint evocation of a 
more compassionate age it may also be an unaffordable luxury for a 
rural county faced with bills for school improvements and other 
priorities 
the county supervisors they dont give a damn about this 
place said the farms director and caretaker delford keckley 
stamping on a sagging board in the kitchen floor at one time 
every county just about had an alms house a place where you 
could go if you had no other place now its just the state or 
social security or what have you that looks after people its not 
the same 
the drab 18th century farmhouse tucked between folds in the 
green and purple hills of northwestern virginia is home to six 
indigents several of whom cannot remember living anywhere else 
at one time the farms population was as high was 40 keckley 
said the residents lived communally dividing chores and raising 
and slaughtering most of their own food state licensing 
regulations eventually forbade that 
the 265acre farm was a gift to the poor of shenandoah county 
from revolutionary war gen peter muhlenberg in 1783 it is open to 
any county resident who can prove indigency 
it is the only home in virginia run solely by a county for its 
poor residents officials said in at least one other case several 
virginia counties and towns operate joint homes for the indigent 
county officials and keckley believe it may be the last 
countyrun poorhouse in the nation although there has been no 
formal accounting of such institutions 
the poorhouse costs the county 91000 annually and 
improvements to meet proposed fire code requirements could cost 
between 80000 and 100000 county administrator john d cutlip 
said 
you can look at the other 94 counties in virginia and see that 
they have done away with their alms houses clearly it was 
something they thought they could not afford cutlip said 
after weeks of debate this spring county officials decided to 
keep the farm open another year while searching for grants or 
historical preservation money to lighten the financial load 
at a public meeting county residents seemed to support keeping 
the poorhouse open but few endorsed a proposed 4cent increase in 
the real estate tax rate to pay for repairs cutlip said 
keckley 67 has sparred with cutlip and the board of 
supervisors frequently in his 10 years at the farm a 
barrelchested man with a gaptoothed smile and cackling laugh he 
is selfappointed watchdog for the interests of some of his older 
charges 
i dont know where theyd go keckley said it would be a 
sin some of these nursing homes around here aint fit to put your 
dog in 
cutlip counters that the farms residents might be better off 
without it they can be served elsewhere and in many cases in 
newer facilities he said 
cutlip also noted many people eligible to live at the farm have 
chosen other options in recent years im assuming since there is 
a declining population at the farm people are finding the other 
options attractive 
but for virginia spence the other options are not attractive 
and the future is suddenly troubling i just dont know she 
said in a thin stumbling voice i dont want to go

land now being used for a military exercise 
soon will be a place for some plain old exercise 
a mock operation in suburban fairview township is giving 
soldiers armed with m16 rifles and bulldozers some practice 
grading a landing strip under combat conditions and helping the 
community build a new soccer field 
col clyde hornberger commander of the 315th engineer group at 
the new cumberland army depot said the army exercise will continue 
for two weeks 
the rough grading will save the township about 150000 but 
wont cost the army extra because the corps conducts twoweek 
operations similar to this each year said charles bender chairman 
of the township board of supervisors 
us secretary of the army michael pw stone last week gave the 
army corps permission to begin the project 
northern york county has been without a soccer field since 
chemical contamination from an abandoned army landfill forced the 
marsh run park to close in 1987 bender said

the nations top military officer gen colin 
powell jumped into the thick of the battle over the pentagon 
budget today saying quick and severe cuts in military spending 
would break the back of our armed forces 
if you suddenly cash in your insurance policy to buy a peace 
dividend you will have neither powell said in a speech prepared 
for delivery to the national press club 
the speech was the generals first major address on the debate 
over spending for the nations military arsenal at a time of 
lessened eastwest tensions 
powell a former national security advisor was sworn in as 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff nine months ago in that 
role he serves as the presidents primary military counselor and 
coordinator of the nations military leaders 
the general said that even though the berlin wall has fallen 
during that time and the warsaw pact has nearly evaporated he has 
been called upon to put american men and women in uniform in harms 
way 
i have been reminded again and again since becoming chairman 
that this is still a dangerous world and that youd better be able 
to respond if someone challenges your interests he said citing 
panama the philippines the persian gulf europe and korea as 
examples 
powell said that while the soviet union has experienced dramatic 
change its military retains the capability of destroying the 
united states with nuclear weaponry within 30 minutes 
we must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a 
decline in the nations enduring defense needs to deal with the 
enduring realities we face powell said 
he noted that defense secretary dick cheney earlier this week 
put forward a plan for cutting the military forces by 25 percent 
over five years signalling that we are willing to examine any 
reasonable proposal 
but powell also defended president bushs 3033 billion 
spending plan for fiscal 1991 as a realistic prudent response 
to the changing world 
that plan the general said will begin to reduce the nations 
forces over time on this glide path we will reach a base force 
which i believe is not prudent to go below if we wish to match 
enduring defense needs with enduring realities powell said 
we know we will get smaller that is inevitable powell 
said but if bushs budget request is cut back significantly you 
will force us to start breaking faith with the nations 
allvolunteer force 
you will force us to start breaking the back of our armed 
forces he said 
the general also took aim at those primarily on capitol hill 
who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time 
although he named no names house armed services chairman les 
aspin dwis has been sharply critical of cheneys 25 percent 
plan and senate armed services chairman sam nunn dga has 
complained about blanks in cheneys budget 
chiding people who clamor for new strategies new vision new 
thinking powell asked such critics for time to plan for a 
gradual reduction of forces 
we are looking ahead with our eyes open were cutting 
programs we want to close bases weve frozen construction and 
hiring were cutting troops were cutting generals the general 
said 
what we need are not more insights on how to trim the margins 
what we need is breathing space we need to time to make the plans 
work powell said

its just not fair 
lisa rapp gets paid 30 an hour to do absolutely nothing her 
boss thinks shes great incredibly there are some workaholics who 
actually applaud her brazen indolence 
to her credit ms rapp doesnt waste time hanging out with 
gossips around the water cooler in fact she doesnt say a word 
she scarcely breathes she hardly ever blinks and never scratches 
her nose 
ms rapp is a living mannequin who spends weekends modeling 
clothes at local shopping malls she stands motionless in high 
heels and stares blankly for two hours at a stretch broken only by 
quick costume changes every 15 minutes 
its not as easy as it looks she says 
especially when your feet are killing you youre sweating in 
the hot lights and kids are yanking on your sleeves or when some 
leering bozo is yelling hi sweetie and trying to tempt you 
with his hot dog or a sip of his coke 
its fun when youre able to fool the public and make them 
think youre not real she says but the hardest part is the 
great deal of mental concentration it takes to ignore everyone 
around you 
frank barone president of the barone modeling agency in 
suburban alexandria va agrees that standing in high heels for 
long hours is tiring work 
a twohour job isnt too bad but four hours is tough and six 
hours is exhausting you really have to be in shape he said 
ms rapp a lithe cheerful 24yearold who works as a doctors 
assistant during the week gets top dollar on her donothing 
weekends barone says shes one of his most photogenic models and 
always attracts big crowds 
when i see her long neck and turnedup nose i think of helen 
of troy the face that launched a thousand ships he says 
barone said his mannequin models like their work because all 
of them want to be looked at and admired but ms rapp says her 
biggest kick is winning the battle of wits with her gawkers 
people dont like to be ignored and thats what im doing 
im ignoring people i think people just hate that she says with 
a laugh 
her secrets 
i think plastic and unresponsive she said i push them 
away with my mind i try to avoid eye contact and concentrate on 
something like the intersection of tiles on the wall if my nose 
itches i simply ignore it when my eyes start watering from the 
air conditioning and i have to blink i blink one eye at a time 
very quickly 
only twice in nearly two years of modeling has ms rapp lapsed 
into giggles once was when a small boy mashed his face against the 
store window and gaped in awe until his mother yanked him away 
the other time a woman had walked around me several times 
before she came up close she reached up my longsleeved blouse to 
pull out the price tag and when she felt warm flesh she shrieked 
and jumped back we both broke out laughing 
ms rapps audiences occasionally burst into applause over her 
virtuoso act 
i cant smile in response but im really happy that someone 
is pleased at what im doing even though im not doing anything at 
all she said

nelson mandela symbol of black african 
liberation urged the united nations today to maintain sanctions 
against south africa until apartheid is abolished and warned of 
danger from armed white racists 
calling apartheid a crime against humanity mandela said 
we strongly urge that there should be no relaxation of existing 
measures the sanctions that have been imposed by the united 
nations and by individual governments should remain in place 
in remarks to the un committee against apartheid mandela also 
issued a warning against white racists among civilians the army 
and police in south africa 
there are many among our white compatriots who are still 
committed to the maintenance of the evil system of white minority 
domination he said some are ideoligically committed to racism 
while others fear democratic majority rule he added 
some of these are to be found within the army and the police 
other whites are working at a feverish pace ot establish 
paramilitary groups whose stated aim is the physical liquidation of 
the african national congress 
mandela deputy president of the anc said we cannot afford 
to underestimate the threat that these defenders of a brutal and 
continuing reality pose to the whole process of working towards a 
just political settlement 
mandela extended greetings to the peoples of palestine who 
are fighting for liberation and human rights we commend their 
struggles to you he said 
but he made no mention of the palestine liberation organization 
or its leader yasser arafat whom he has called a comrade in 
arms mandela also has said he supports israels right to exist 
mandela arrived to a standing ovation at the united nations for 
what was generally regarded as the most important adress of his 
us tour the united nations had demanded for years that he be 
released from prison where he spent 27 years for his 
antiapartheid struggle before he was set free this year 
several hundred delegates dignitaries and celebrities cheered 
for several minutes as mandela entered the packed hall waving both 
hands and smiling among the guests invited were mayor david 
dinkins boxer joe frazier the rev jesse jackson boxing promoter 
don king boxers ray leonard and mike tyson and theater director 
joseph papp 
as mandela spoke a radarequipped police launch cruised close 
offshore in the east river as part of strict security to protect 
him a south africa newspaper reported friday that a white racist 
group including a former nazi had plotting to kill mandela and 
president fw de klerk who released mandela 
south africa a un member was ousted from the 159member 
general assembly in 1974 and was not represented in the hall the 
united states is not a member of the committee but three top 
ambassadors were present 
the united nations has for years led the battle against 
apartheid in the international arena the 159nation body has 
denounced south africas system of racial segregation called for 
the establishment of a nonracial democracy and backed sanctions 
against south africa in his current 14nation tour mandela has 
been urging that such sanctions be kept in place in order to keep 
up the pressure on south africas government 
united nations efforts to win mandelas release date back at 
least to 1976 when the general assembly proclaimed an annual day 
of solidarity with all south african political prisoners in 1982 
it endorsed a campaign joined by 2000 mayors worldwide for the 
release of mandela and other prisoners 
since 1962 the general assembly has urged the council to impose 
mandatory economic sanctions against south africa but the assembly 
only can make recommendations and the united states and britain 
have vetoed efforts in the council to mandate certain sanctions 
in a special general assembly session in middecember the 
assembly agreed without a dissenting vote that while the 
apartheid system in south africa persists the peoples of africa as 
a whole cannot achieve justice human dignity and peace 
apartheid it said is a crime against the conscience and 
dignity of mankind

west germany gave final approval today 
to the economic merger with east germany a move that will 
effectively unite the two countries after 40 years of cold war 
division 
parliaments upper house or bundesrat passed the state treaty 
a day after the east german parliament and the powerful lower house 
of the west german parliament approved it 
with the decision the mighty west german mark becomes the 
official currency in east germany on july 2 the historic pact 
marks the de facto unification of germany and the end of 40 years 
of communism in east germany 
also today the soviet union said a united germany can join nato 
after a fiveyear transition period during which all soviet and 
us troops would leave the country the united states rejected the 
proposal a us official said 
the proposal was outlined by soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze during international talks in east berlin on the 
strategic future of a united germany 
shevardnadze also proposed the withdrawal of the allies troops 
from berlin six months after german unification that plan 
apparently includes soviet soldiers stationed just outside east 
berlin 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said us 
officials objected to the fiveyear time limit before germany could 
join nato the official said the other western ministers expressed 
the same reservations 
the united states wants a united germany to be a member of the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the soviet union has been 
staunchly opposed 
there are about 380000 soviet troops in east germany and 
250000 us troops and tens of thousands of british and french 
soldiers are stationed in west germany 
there was little reaction when the president of the west german 
bundesrat walter momper polled each of the 11 west german states 
on whether they approved the treaty on economic monetary and 
social unification 
by contrast loud applause and standing ovations greeted passage 
of the treaty in east berlin and the lower house in bonn thursday 
only the west german states of lower saxony and saarland voted 
to reject the treaty they are social democratic strongholds and 
saarland is the home state of social democratic chancellor 
candidate oskar lafontaine the most vocal opponent of the pact 
lafontaine was not in the chamber for todays debate he was on 
vacation 
the opposition social democrats who control the chamber had 
criticized the speed with which unity was approaching and what they 
saw as the treatys lack of adequate support for east germans after 
socialist support systems fall to freemarket rules 
but they said they would not torpedo the pact because of the 
high expectations for german unification that have mounted since 
the fall of the berlin wall in november 
some experts have predicted up to 2 million unemployed in east 
germany as outmoded governmentowned factories and businesses try 
to compete more than a third of the enterprises are expected to 
close and there are fears social unrest could result 
west germans fear the high cost of unification and worry about 
the possibility of higher taxes and inflation 
political unification is now seen as a possibility before years 
end and the conservative christian democrats of west german 
chancellor helmut kohl have called for allgerman elections in 
december 
east germanys hardline communist regime fell amid massive 
demonstrations last fall giving way to elections in march that 
brought to power the countrys first noncommunist government that 
immediately began negotiating unification 
but before germany can become one again the international 
ramifications of unification such as the new germanys military 
status are to be resolved in negotiations between the two germanys 
and the allies 
both german parliaments on thursday approved a resolution 
recognizing polands western border the oderneisse rivers as 
final 
both sides declare that they will not raise territorial claims 
now or in the future the resolution said 
the issue had become one of the most emotional in the runup to 
full german unification poles feared a united germany might try to 
retake former territories lost to poland after world war ii and 
ultraconservative west germans saw the return of the territories 
as homeland rights 
kohls reticence to clearly recognize the polish border only 
fueled concerns in march after international and domestic 
criticism he called for the resolution that was passed thursday 
night

personal spending was flat in may the 
government said friday in a report indicating growing caution among 
consumers who have been a major source of strength for the economy 
during seven years of growth 
the consumer clearly has pulled back in a dramatic fashion 
said stephen s roach senior economist with morgan stanley amp co 
in new york 
the commerce department said consumer spending remained 
unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 366 trillion 
after seven straight months of gains including 05 percent in 
april and 03 percent in march 
but even the april and march advances were weaker than first 
thought they were revised downward from 06 percent and 05 
percent reported last month 
consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health 
since it accounts for about twothirds of the nations economic 
activity 
analysts have cited a poor job market and weak wage increases 
for the flagging consumer confidence 
indeed the commerce department said personal incomes rose just 
03 percent in may for a second straight month to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 470 trillion the identical gains 
followed three consecutive monthly advances of 08 percent and were 
the lowest since a 02 percent increase last september 
the income gains have not even matched the inflation rate 
observed economist sandra shaber of the futures group a washington 
management consulting firm certainly consumers are feeling the 
pinch she said 
fridays report was the latest indicating a slowdown in consumer 
spending which has been a driving force for much of the current 
economic expansion now in its eighth year 
the commerce department reported last week that retail sales 
fell in may their third consecutive monthly decline it was the 
first time retail sales fell for three straight months since the 
summer of 1981 during the last recession retail sales represent 
about half of overall consumer spending 
and the department on thursday revised downward its previous 
estimate of consumer spending in the first quarter 
nevertheless roach said the slow pace of consumer spending is 
not likely to tip the economy into a recession since there are 
other things out there still boosting the economy 
roach cited a second commerce department report friday showing 
that orders for durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
at least three years jumped 39 percent in may 
paul getman an economist with regional financial associates in 
west chester pa said there have been some signs recently of a 
manufacturing rebound 
exports are healthy and inventories are rather low which 
bodes okay for a pickup in manufacturing and durable goods over the 
next six months getman said 
the difference between incomes and spending in may helped 
improve americans savings rate the rate savings as a percent of 
disposable income rose to 62 percent following a 60 percent 
rate in april and a 63 percent rate in march the march rate was 
the highest in five years 
a higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital 
since more funds thus would be available domestically for business 
investment 
the report said americans income after taxes increased 02 
percent the same rate as in april the key component of the income 
category wages and salaries rose 103 billion after a 164 
billion gain in april 
on the spending side purchases of durable goods fell 126 
billion after an 85 billion gain in april durable goods 
purchases had fallen the previous two months 
purchases of nondurable goods were down 500 million in may 
their third consecutive decline spending on services slowed to 
131 billion after a 147 billion gain in april and a 196 
billion advance in march

an israeli colonel accused of ordering 
soldiers to break the limbs of palestinians testified friday that 
beatings were part of the accepted norm in that period of the 
palestinian uprising 
testifying in his own defense col yehuda meir told three 
military judges that his superiors did not question the beatings 
because there was nothing special in it there was nothing out 
of the ordinary 
meir testified thursday that former defense minister yitzhak 
rabin gave orders in january 1988 to break the bones of palestinian 
inciters as punishment 
rabin rejected meirs contention in an interview friday on 
israel radio he said he ordered the army to beat rioters only to 
bring them under control 
meir 37 is being courtmartialed on seven felony counts the 
most serious charge causing bodily harm with malicious intent 
carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment 
military prosecutors say soldiers acting on meirs orders 
arrested about 21 palestinians in two west bank villages in january 
1988 took them into nearby fields and beat the bound and gagged 
detainees with rifles and clubs 
at least 12 palestinians from the villages of hawara and beita 
were reported to have had their limbs broken in the two incidents 
israeli military authorities introduced beatings as a method to 
deter arab demonstrators a month after the palestinian uprising 
against israeli rule of the west bank and gaza strip began in 
december 1987 
meir admitted ordering beatings but said he now feels abandoned 
by rabin and by maj gen amram mitzna the former military 
commander of the west bank and meirs former commanding officer 
i feel like they abandoned me and threw me to the dogs meir 
told the judges he began to cry minutes later and asked for a 
recess 
mitzna testified last month that beatings were not to be 
administered as punishment but were only intended to disperse 
protesters and control detainees he was a prosecution witness 
meir resumed his testimony after a 30minute break he accused 
his superior officers of double bookkeeping he said they spoke 
in two different directions with two different voices one for 
those who have to do the work and the other for the news media 
the us government the legal system and leftwing israeli public 
officials 
he also said he had been opposed to the policy of beatings 
which was begun at a time when soldiers were more restricted in 
their use of gunfire 
the beatings inevitably resulted in excessive use of force and 
did not deter palestinian demonstrators meir said 
the soldiers were satisfied they could vent all their 
anger all their frustration he testified in essence the 
army started to behave like hooligans 
meir rejected the testimony of two soldiers who said he ordered 
them to break an arm or leg of a 14yearold palestinian before 
releasing him 
one of the soldiers was not telling the truth meir said 
he suggested that the other soldier might have mistakenly 
identified him because the jacket he was wearing concealed his rank 
meir was reprimanded for his conduct and placed on leave without 
pay from the army israels supreme court responding to a lawsuit 
by the association for civil rights in israel ordered military 
prosecutors to put meir on trial the courtmartial began march 29

nelson mandela charmed business leaders and 
brought his message of liberation to the united nations this 
morning endorsing sanctions against south africa until apartheid 
is abolished 
we strongly urge that there should be no relaxation of 
existing measures mandela told the un committee against 
apartheid the sanctions that have been imposed by the united 
nations and by individual governments should remain in place 
mandela deputy president of the african national congress 
leader said the world should be aware there are white racists in 
south africa still bent on the physical liquidation of his 
organization 
we cannot afford to underestimate the threat that these 
defenders of a brutal and continuing reality pose to the whole 
process of working towards a just political settlement said 
mandela who was greeted at the un with two standing ovations 
one on arrival and one before his speech 
in johannesburg south africa police have arrested 11 whites in 
connection with a rightwing plot to assassinate mandela president 
fw de klerk and other figures a newspaper reported today 
authorities confirmed the arrests and said all were later 
released the afrikaanslanguage weekly vryeweekblad said that 
under the plan mandela would have been shot at johannesburgs jan 
smuts airport when he returned home july 18 
mandelas un address was considered the most important 
appearance of his us tour which began wednesday 
earlier mandela displayed the same deft touch hes brought to 
stadiums and street corners in addressing a group of the citys top 
business leaders at the world trade center this morning 
the african national congress leader met with 150 
representatives of fortune 500 companies and other corporate 
executives at the lower manhattan skyscraper to assuage their 
doubts about investments in his troubled homeland 
he was bringing hope to these people about the future and 
they responded extremely well said port authority chairman 
richard leone there was a crackling excitement in the audience 
and you dont usually see that in an audience of this type 
the port authority a government agency that runs the trade center 
was a cohost of the closed meeting 
mandela still basking from his packed receptions in harlem and 
yankee stadium a night earlier told reporters after the meeting 
that his new york welcome has been beyond my wildest dreams 
the outpouring of emotion and exuberance since his arrival here 
on wednesday will send him home strong and inspired mandela 
said mayor david dinkins flashed a thumbsup sign when mandela 
made his comment 
on thursday mandela made exuberant and emotional appeals to a 
packed house at yankee stadium and an estimated 100000 people at a 
rally in harlem 
earlier the 71yearold freedom fighter and other participants 
in an ecumenical service at riverside church danced jubilantly to 
the beat of african drummers the service with 2000 guests 
brought religious leaders of all faihs together in a call for 
equality 
before leaving for the closed meeting with business leaders he 
started the day early with a walk to and through carl schurz park 
not far from gracie mansion where mandela has been staying with 
dinkins 
mandela wore a blue business suit for the 635 am jaunt 
dinkins tagged along in a jogging suit mandela smiled and said 
hello to joggers and benchsitters 
in his public addresses thursday mandela urged a redoubling of 
efforts to bring a speedy end to this shameful blot on humanity 
we are on the verge of victory but the last mile of the 
freedom road could prove to be the most difficult and the most 
intractable he warned 
international pressure must be intensified and sanctions 
maintained keep the pressure on apartheid mandela said 
reiterating the main theme of his 14nation tour to raise money for 
the black nationalist anc 
the crowds in harlem began gathering hours before mandela 
arrived an hour behind schedule many wore the red black and 
green colors of african liberation 
police estimated the crowd numbered 100000 
to our people harlem symbolizes strength mandela told the 
crowd to a roar of applause 
at the street rally and later at a soldout yankee stadium he 
credited the unceasing solidarity of millions throughout the 
world with helping to win his release from prison feb 11 after 
27 years served for antiapartheid activities 
the 52000 tickets to the stadium sold for 5 to 500 
organizers said they raised more than 250000 for the anc 
while focusing his remarks on conditions in his homeland 
mandela and his wife winnie also noted the struggle against 
racism that continues in this country 
as we enter the last decade of the 20th century it is 
intolerable unacceptable that the cancer of racism is still 
eating away at the fabric of societies in different parts of our 
planet he said 
all of us black and white should spare no effort in our 
struggle against all forms and manifestations of racism wherever 
and whenever it rears its ugly head 
mandelas visit to the united states has tapped deep emotions in 
black communities in new york where at least 1 million people 
have come out to see him so far a surge of pride has welled up in 
poor neighborhoods 
at a town meeting with ted koppel that aired thursday night 
on abc mandela was asked why he supported palestinian leader 
yasser arafat cuban president fidel castro and libyan strongman 
moammar gadhafi 
one of the mistakes the western world makes is to think that 
their enemies should be our enemies he replied to the 
audiences loud approval we have our own struggle 
he added that those leaders are placing resources at our 
disposal to win the struggle 
before the ecumenical service mandela met privately with 150 
religious leaders and received a 200000 check donations also 
were made during the service and collected at the harlem rally 
the days appearances ended on a lighter note at yankee stadium 
when dinkins presented mandela a new york yankees warmup jacket 
and cap 
now you know who i am a beaming mandela said i am a

robin hud the former real estate agent who 
claimed she stole from the department of housing and urban 
development to help the poor was sentenced today to nearly four 
years in prison and ordered to return 110000 to the government 
us district judge herbert murray followed the prosecution 
recommendation to sentence marilyn harrell to 46 months federal 
sentencing guidelines called for a sentence of 30 to 37 months but 
the judge agreed to a prosecution recommendation to increase the 
sentence for aggravating factors the total however is still less 
than the maximum 
harrells attorney public defender anthony gallagher had asked 
for a sentence of 16 months half to be served in a halfway house 
or some other community based program 
i have never said what i did was right harrell said in 
court in fact if a person steals five cents then they should be 
done with whatever the court sees fit 
harrell 46 was nicknamed robin hud after claiming she 
siphoned off millions from the sale of governmentowned houses and 
gave most of it to charity she has acknowledged stealing 57 
million and pleaded guilty in january to stealing government 
property and filing a false tax return 
murray also sentenced harrell to serve three years probation 
624 hours of community service and 600000 in restitution for the 
embezzlement charge she was ordered to serve one year in prison 
concurrently on the tax charge 
some of those funds used admittedly were for good purposes 
the judge said but a substantial amount of the whole sum went to 
you or members of your family 
harrell told the judge that wasnt true and gallagher said 
later that the sentence would be appealed 
about 490000 worth of property she owned has already been 
forfeited to hud she now owes approximately 110000 
the two charges carry a maximum sentence of 13 years in prison 
and 500000 in fines 
us attorney general dick thornburgh has called the case the 
largest theft of federal funds by an individual harrell became a 
symbol of mismanagement at hud during the reagan administration 
when the scandal broke 
character witnesses testified today that harrell gave them a 
place to live and helped feed the poor 
marilyn saw that id have everything i that i needed said 
carol ann swift a double amputee who lived at a womens home that 
harrell supported with government funds she gave me a home she 
went and got me clothes furnished transportation and paid all my 
doctors bills and medication bills 
the rev henry studer of prince georges county md testified 
that harrell gave 10000 for the down payment on a building for 
maryland rescue ministry and would sometimes take two and three 
families at a time to giant supermarket at 200 a pop 
before sentencing the total amount of theft and the amount given 
to charity had been disputed by both sides the figures were not 
resolved in court today 
prosecutors said in a presentencing memorandum that harrell 
failed to turn in to huds washington office about 66 million 
from the sale of 99 properties between 1985 and 1988 of that 
amount harrell gave about 11 million to charity prosecutors 
said 
gallagher disputed those figures in a memo filed wednesday 
claiming harrell spent more than 51 million to help others and 
kept only 243000 
as an escrow agent harrell collected money from the sales of 
property purchased with hudguaranteed loans that had been 
foreclosed on harrell said lax management allowed her to divert 
the proceeds

orders for bigticket durable goods jumped 
39 percent in may the government reported friday analysts said 
it was further evidence the economys sluggish manufacturing sector 
may be bouncing back 
there have been some signs of a manufacturing rebound said 
economist paul getman of regional financial associates in west 
chester pa exports are healthy and inventories are rather low 
which bodes okay for a pickup in manufacturing and durable goods 
over the next six months 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
such as automobiles and appliances expected to last at least three 
years totaled a seasonally adjusted 1282 billion after falling 
42 percent in april 
orders have risen during three of the last four months after 
plunging a record 105 percent in january 
the 39 percent increase in durable goods orders almost offset 
the 42 percent decline registered the previous month said 
gordon richards an economist with the national association of 
manufacturers 
taken in conjunction with the stronger 67 percent gain in 
march there are signs that industrial activity may be gradually 
emerging from its slump he added 
stephen s roach senior economist with morgan stanley amp co in 
new york noted that much of the recent manufacturing weakness has 
been in the automobile industry 
with the auto sector moving back to more normal the 
manufacturing tone in terms of orders unfilled orders and 
industrial production is starting to look a little better roach 
said it could be an element of hope that has not been present 
for over a year 
most of the may increase was in transportation equipment up 99 
percent to 353 billion nearly twothirds of this advance was 
concentrated in automobiles most of the remainder was in aircraft 
transportation orders have been volatile during much of the 
year including a 135 percent drop in april and a 241 percent 
gain in march 
excluding transportation orders were up 18 percent in may 
but while analysts saw some reason for optimism in the overall 
report the closely watched nondefense capital goods sector often 
a barometer of business investment plans fell 14 percent to 361 
billion it was the fourth decline this year after peaking in 
december at 444 billion 
defense orders another volatile category jumped 190 percent

eric levin hoped a catchy name for his 
record store would bring in business but he got more attention 
than he wanted after opening secret service music amp more 
the shop specializing in progressive and hardtofind recordings 
hadnt been open long when the 20yearold owner got a visit from 
two real secret service agents they told him he was violating a 
federal law by using the name of their employer 
their reasoning was that if someone knew of someone 
threatening the life of the president and wanted to call the secret 
service they could get confused levin said thursday 
the agents who showed up may 21 confiscated levins business 
cards several posters and several dozen tshirts featuring the 
stores logo 
a shaken levin who had no idea he was breaking the law agreed 
to change the stores name 
its now criminal records

police detained 11 white men 
in connection with an alleged plot by rightwing whites to kill 
nelson mandela and president fw de klerk the men were released 
friday after questioning 
a newspaper said the plan called for mandela to be shot at 
johannesburgs jan smuts airport when he returns july 18 from his 
sixweek tour of north america africa and europe the 
assassinations were intended to create chaos and cause a white 
rightwing uprising to stop the governments racial reforms the 
vrye weekblad newspaper said 
the south african press association quoted mandela as saying in 
new york he was too busy to worry about reports of the plot 
mandela told reporters the african national congress would be able 
to function well without him if he were assassinated sapa said 
vrye weekblad said the plot was exposed by jannie smith a 
former security policeman and national intelligence service agent 
after he infiltrated farright groups smith went into hiding under 
police guard friday after giving police an affidavit vrye weekblad 
editor max du preez said 
working with newspaper staff smith taped conversations by 
having himself wired and rooms bugged police have been given 
copies of recordings containing information about the plot and a 
detailed affidavit the paper said 
in his affidavit smith said i believe that various members of 
the awb afrikaner resistance movement are very serious in putting 
these plans into action urgent action against them is needed to 
prevent a bloodbath 
the afrikaner resistance movement is the bestknown of south 
africas rightwing white organizations and it was among those 
smith infiltrated 
kays smit chief secretary of the afrikaner resistance movement 
said in a bbc radio interview that several members of the 
organization were among those detained thursday but seeing that 
the police has released all of them it was a frameup by the 
newspapers smit added 
a spokesman for the ministry of law and order capt peet 
bothma said the 11 white men were released after questioning he 
said they had been held under a law that allows police to hold a 
suspect for 48 hours for questioning 
if the police believe there is a case to pursue they will 
present the information to the attorneygeneral who may then 
decide whether to prosecute bothma said 
so far we dont have much but there are certain leads that we 
are following bothma said he refused to disclose details from 
the questioning or identify any of the men detained 
the newspaper quoted smith as saying south african communist 
party leader joe slovo minister of law and order adriaan vlok 
foreign minister pik botha and defense minister magnus malan were 
also threatened by rightwing elements 
de klerks government this year freed mandela from prison after 
he served 27 years of a life sentence for plotting against the 
government de klerk has also scrapped some apartheid laws and 
lifted the state of emergency in most of the country since he took 
office in september 
the changes have angered the countrys rightwing whites who 
oppose sharing power with the black majority currently blacks 
have no representation in parliament and are barred from voting in 
national elections 
the newspaper said a former nazi captain whom it identified as 
heinrich beissner was behind the plot to kill mandela it 
identified beissner as a regional head of the afrikaner resistance 
movement 
governmentrun television quoted smit as acknowledging that 
beissner was a member of the afrikaner resistance movement but 
saying he would never have been placed in charge of any military 
operation 
the afrikaner resistance movement also planned to blow up power 
stations kill members of parliament and poison the water supply to 
soweto a huge black residential area outside johannesburg the 
newspaper said 
an anc spokesman ronnie mamoepa said this attempt to bring 
about total anarchy must be harnessed before it is fully 
unleashed 
the newspaper said smith was told june 19 that he was to carry 
out the mandela assassination using a rifle with telescopic sights 
once smith heard of the plot he informed the anc of which 
mandela is deputy president they had planned it in detail it 
could have worked de preez said they had a very special rifle 
with very special bullets 
a council member on the rightwing boksburg town council tj 
ferreira was among those arrested thursday night ferreira told an 
independent radio station he was not involved in any plot

cancer surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence ici 
pharmaceuticals group of wilmington del sells it as nolvadex 
fda had previously approved tamoxifen for women in whom cancer 
cells had spread to the lymph nodes under the arm given that

a woman whose child died of meningitis 
while a christian science practitioner was treating the girl with 
prayer has been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter 
laurie walker whose 4yearold daughter shauntay died in 
1984 was placed on probation and sentenced to up to 600 hours of 
community service thursday by superior court judge george 
nicholson walker had waived a jury trial 
according to court records shauntay fell ill feb 21 1984 and 
her mother following a basic premise of christian science that 
disease can be healed through prayer alone shunned medical 
treatment and sought the services of an accredited christian 
science practitioner 
the practitioner norma alpert prayed for the child in 
accordance with the tenets and practices of the religion but the 
childs breathing became labored and she died march 9 1984 
according to court documents no charges were filed against alpert 
walker was then accused of involuntary manslaughter and child 
endangerment allegations that she has contested for six years 
nicholsons decision also contains protections for walkers 
older daughter tamu until dec 25 1994 tamus 18th birthday 
the mother is obliged to let the daughter decide how she wishes to 
be treated medically in the event of illness 
prosecutor john omara said he agreed to the terms of the 
settlement because the same result would have occurred had it gone 
to trial he also said nothing would be gained by jailing walker 
who now lives in boston 
similar cases have arisen around the nation but the us 
supreme court typically has refused to hear such cases and there 
has been little consensus in state courts around the country

to hobie cawood the proposed monument to 
the constitution is a thing of beauty and grace symbolism and 
significance to edmund bacon it looks like bugs bunny ears 
the first amendment right of free speech was exercised fully 
thursday when independence national historical park held an open 
house to display models and drawings of the monument 
detractors said the limited competition that led to the design 
was inadequate for a national monument some bemoaned the loss of 
the fountain now on the independence mall site across the street 
from the liberty bell pavilion 
if built according to current plan the 5 million monument 
would consist of two 19foothigh walls running parallel and 
pointing at the bell and independence hall at the base a shallow 
fountain would rush over a mosaic of stone 
bacon a former city planning commission director and one of 
those responsible for the park and mall maintained a steady stream 
of criticism and passed out typed lists of his complaints at the 
open house 
whats going on here is supposed to be the monument to the 
constitution which in a certain sense transcends even the 
washington jefferson and lincoln memorials because it is not to an 
individual it is to a great concept he said i think it looks 
dinky i think it looks like bugs bunny ears 
somebody else said it looks like the security things you pass 
through when you go into an airport and other people think it 
looks like billboards 
and it is so clear that in that huge space it will look 
absolutely ridiculous and it will make the city of philadelphia 
and the nation look silly 
replied cawood superintendent of the park what is ed bacons 
monstrosity is somebody elses work of art 
under the plan the walls would have the constitution 
amendments and all etched in bronze on the outside the walls 
would be faced with stone slabs from all 50 states 
its a sincere attempt to make something appropriate 
something that is a thing of beauty said designer bruce 
thompson who had to pretend not to hear such comments as i 
dont like this at all 
the plan would require the demolition of the circular fountain 
which has been dry since 1987 cawood said it is beyond repair 
dangerous and too expensive to operate 
opponents argue the fountain could be fixed for half the 
expected 5 million cost of the new monument 
citizens were encouraged to write down their comments and leave 
them in a box 
besides the differing opinions money is a problem though 
congress passed a bill in 1988 authorizing the building of a 
monument its up to cawood to find the money from private and 
public sources 
as benjamin franklin said nothing in life is certain except 
death and taxes cawood said

children entralled with the teenage 
mutant ninja turtles should be reminded that the swashbuckling 
exploits of the movie arent meant to be played out in the streets 
safety experts said friday 
at the northampton studios where the popular characters were 
created a few calls have been received mainly dealing with 
children who apparently went looking for their heroes in reallife 
drainage systems said cheryl prindle executive director of mirage 
studios 
since the sewerdwelling comicbook heroes made a smash screen 
debut in april there have been a few reports of injuries 
officials said they dont see any widespread problem but they do 
recommend using some parental common sense 
there are isolated things here and isolated things there 
said bob obrien director of public relations for the 
chicagobased national safety council 
the comicbook characters a quartet of green hip creatures who 
got their super crimefighting powers after falling into a puddle 
of radioactive goo in a new york city sewer use martial arts 
techniques learned from the mutant pet rat of a ninja master 
basically our feeling is that kids need to be able to discern 
what is real and what isnt prindle said 
definitely the ninja turtles dont encourage the kids to go 
in the sewers looking for them she said i do definitely agree 
with the national safety council that children need supervision 
whether it be from the home or the school or wherever it is theyre 
playing 
in worcester the director of the university of massachusetts 
medical center pediatric trauma care said he has seen about a 
halfdozen young patients since april who said they were playing at 
being turtles 
the kids are very impressionable and the turtles have never 
looked so cool as they do in the movies so i think theyre bound to 
be imitated said dr michael p hirsh 
elsewhere two young boys in the dayton ohio area had to be 
pulled from a pond by adults after they followed a sewer culvert to 
its end the mother of one of the boys said the children were 
pretending to be ninja turtles also in april a lombard ill boy 
dropped a manhole cover on his foot authorities said 
the turtles have been around since 1984 when northampton 
friends kevin eastman and peter laird scraped up the funds for the 
first printing of their characters from there the characters 
michelangelo raphael donatello and leonardo got their own 
television show their film debut was the biggest spring opening in

two hospital pharmacy workers were fired 
friday after the deaths of three premature infants that had 
received an incorrectly mixed intravenous solution hospital 
officials said 
the infants were given an iv solution incorrectly prepared in 
the pharmacy that contained potassium said martin goldsmith 
president of albert einstein medical center the potassium caused 
a drop in heart rate in the three babies despite aggressive 
resuscitation efforts the infants died 
an internal investigation into the deaths of two girls and a boy 
in the neonatal intensive care unit june 1516 revealed that 
pharmacy workers incorrectly prepared a solution used to flush an 
iv tube after medication is given the hospital said 
the iv solution should have contained heparin dextrose and 
water goldsmith said instead it contained heparin and 
potassium 
three employees were initially suspended but one was cleared 
friday by the hospital investigation the two others a pharmacist 
and a pharmacy technician were fired the hospital said the 
employees names were not released 
goldsmith said the infants were very ill all were born 13 to 15 
weeks premature and weighed less than 2 pounds at the time of 
death the hospital said 
all three deaths were ruled accidental by the medical examiner 
said spokesman bill gilbert immediate cause of death for all three 
was hyperkalemia or abnormally high potassium levels in the blood 
he said 
the medical examiners office identified the victims all of 
philadelphia as latoya simmons 1 month old george rodriguez 3 
months and rayna williams 15 days old prematurity was listed as 
a contributing factor in the deaths 
goldsmith said the hospital reviewed safety procedures and is 
strictly monitoring compliance he ordered mandatory inservice 
training for all pharmacy workers and will bring in outside experts 
to review safety procedures 
we are certain this was an isolated occurrence due to human 
error and we want to make sure were doing everything possible to 
prevent future accidents goldsmith said 
goldsmith said hospital officials felt remorse about the 
deaths 
we are distraught that we had a mistake made in our 
pharmacy he said

the interior department citing evidence the 
northern spotted owl may become extinct ordered the reclusive bird 
protected friday as a threatened species putting thousands of 
logging jobs into jeopardy 
the decision was expected to dramatically curtail logging across 
millions of acres of virgin forests in the pacific northwest where 
intense clearing of ancient trees over decades has destroyed the 
owls habitat and put its survival into question 
but the government said the regions jobs complicated the issue 
and postponed an announcement of a specific owl recovery plan on 
what logging restrictions will be required to protect the brown 
bird an announcement on the forest management plan was expected 
next week 
the biological evidence says that the northern spotted owl is 
in trouble said john turner director of the fish and wildlife 
service who made the decision to declare the owl threatened under 
the endangered species act 
we will not and by law cannot ignore that evidence 
industry and government estimates said as many as 28000 timber 
industry jobs could be lost in the next decade and entire logging 
communities disrupted by restrictions to protect the owl 
environmentalists who have fought to protect the owl say those 
estimates are exaggerated 
our intention now is to find ways to protect the owl with the 
least possible disruption to the timber economy in the pacific 
northwest said turner he said he is convinced there is room 
to protect both the owl and loggers 
the estimated 3000 to 5000 pairs of remaining northern spotted 
owls are scattered in oldgrowth forest in washington oregon and 
northern california an area that also accounts for by far the 
largest supply of lumber in this country 
turner said compelling evidence shows that the spotted owl is 
at risk of extinction if current logging practices continue and 
more forest is destroyed in the three states 
although the decision to protect the owl is expected to have 
widespread impact on logging turner said he does not foresee 
significant disruption of this summers harvesting of northwest 
timber 
planned logging is going to go on and with very little 
disruption said turner timber cutting under current contracts 
with the government would proceed he said the effective date of 
turners listing of the owl as threatened goes into effect july 23 
about 90 percent of the remaining spotted owls live in forests 
owned by the federal government and managed by either the us 
forest service or interiors bureau of land management 
interior secretary manuel lujan and agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter are to announce next tuesday a plan aimed at 
protecting the owl on the government lands and at the same time 
reduce the disruption to logging communities our plan will 
be to achieve a balance said interior spokesman steve goldstein 
the management plan which is envisioned to include curbs on 
logging must be approved by the fish and wildlife service to 
assure it provides protection to the bird private landowners 
seeking to cut in areas where the owl lives will also have to take 
steps to limit the impact on owl habitat officials said 
designation of a species as threatened makes it illegal to harm 
any of the owls or destroy their critical habitat without federal 
government approval a threatened species is one that is likely to 
become endangered in the foreseeable future it is afforded similar 
protections as species classified as endangered 
the protection applies to owl on both private and government 
land under some circumstances private land owners may petition to 
cut in areas occupied by the owl federal agencies may not allow 
cutting on federal lands unless a tree harvesting plan has been 
approved by the fish and wildlife service 
the decision to protect the owl represents a reversal by the 
fish and wildlife service which for many years refused to list the 
bird and had to be forced by a federal court in 1988 to reconsider 
the status of the owl

the two germanys for 40 years the 
most visible symbol of the cold war divide on friday took their 
biggest step toward unification by reaching final agreement on 
economic merger 
in east berlin representatives of the world war ii victors and 
vanquished gathered to discuss german unity and one of the most 
notorious markers of eastwest conflict checkpoint charlie was 
removed from the berlin wall 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in berlin for the 
unity talks said a united germany could join nato after a 
fiveyear transition period and the pullout of foreign troops from 
the country secretary of state james a baker iii rejected the 
proposal saying it was a decision for the germans to make after 
unification 
nonetheless shevardnadze said later he hoped agreement on 
unification could be reached by the end of the year 
despite international differences over unification the german 
states continued the race to merge 
government officials in bonn speaking on condition of 
anonymity said an allgerman election was most likely dec 9 
they said chancellor helmut kohl preferred that date because it 
would allow a new parliament to convene in early january an 
earlier date would have required the new parliament to meet between 
christmas and new year the sources said 
wighard haerdtl an official in west germanys interior 
ministry said friday negotiations were under way between east and 
west germany for a second treaty outlining the consitutional 
aspects of german unification he said it should be ready for 
signing in september 
the only real remaining obstacle to unification is the military 
stance of a united germany the united states and western allies 
want the new country to be a member of the north atlantic treaty 
organization the soviet union has refused to accept this 
baker rejected shevardnadzes conditional acceptance plan 
friday saying the issue should be decided by a sovereign germany 
with little fanfare the upper house of the west german 
parliament on friday approved the treaty that will merge the 
economies of the german states on july 2 
on that day the powerful west german deutsche mark takes over 
east germanys 40 years of rigid socialism gives way to capitalism 
and the borders that once separated families and worlds will fall 
on thursday lawmakers in the east german parliament and the 
powerful lower house of the west german parliament overwhelmingly 
approved the economic treaty and sealed their decision with joyous 
applause 
both countries also pledged to respect polands western border 
and not make any territorial claims after unification on german 
territory lost after world war ii the issue had become one of the 
most sensitive in the unification realm about a third of 
presentday poland is former german territory 
west german finance minister theo waigel appeared before the 
bundesrat or upper house friday to argue for passage of the 
economic treaty 
the west german opposition social democrats had long criticized 
the swift pace of unification and complained the treaty on 
monetary economic and social union didnt contain enough 
safeguards for east germans as they move from a socialist economy 
to a free market 
nontheless passage had been virtually assured social 
democratic chairman hans jochenvogel had said thursday they 
wouldnt torpedo the treaty because east german expectations were 
too high and uncontrollable events could result from a novote 
in fridays debate lothar spaeth governor of the 
badenwuerttemberg state and a member of kohls christian 
democrats called it a most ridiculous argument that economic 
unification move more slowly 
the people over there have set the pace he said noting the 
hundreds of thousands of east germans who fled their repressive 
communist country last year after borders were open to the west 
kohl was meeting with french president francois mitterrand on 
the rhine when the economic treaty gained final approval and there 
was no immediate reaction from the man who aspires to be the first 
chancellor of a unified germany 
in a plea thursday for approval of the pact he said the hopes 
of the people of germany for the unity and freedom of all germans 
are about to be fulfilite the rush to unification there are many fears 
about next 
months economic merger 
some experts have predicted up to 2 million east germans will 
lose their jobs as outmoded governmentowned factories and 
businesseled 
desps try to compete in the freemarket system more than a 
third of the enterprises are expected to close and social unrest 
could result 
west germans worry how much unification could cost them either 
in possibly higher taxes or inflation 
however the west german government has said it wont raise 
taxes and in may unveiled a nearly 70 billion german unity fund 
to be used to rebuild east germany

the nations top military officer jumped into 
the pentagon budget battle friday arguing that hasty cuts in 
military spending will end up breaking the back of americas 
defense 
if you suddenly cash in your insurance policy to buy a 
socalled peace dividend you will get neither gen colin 
powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said in a speech to 
the national press club 
as we get smaller we also need to get better if we do it too 
fast we dont get better we get hollow he said warning 
against a return to the postvietnam war and world war ii 
reductions 
powells blunt remarks were his first major commentary on the 
debate over spending for the nations military arsenal at a time of 
lessened eastwest tensions 
a former national security adviser powell now serves as the 
presidents primary military counselor and coordinator of the 
nations military leaders 
powell said that even though the berlin wall has fallen and the 
warsaw pact has nearly evaporated he has had to place the american 
military in dangerous situations during his brief stint in office 
i have been reminded again and again since becoming chairman 
that this is still a dangerous world and that youd better be able 
to respond if someone challenges your interests he said citing 
panama the philippines the persian gulf europe and korea as 
examples 
powell said that despite changes in the soviet union the 
soviets still have the ability to destroy the united states with 
nuclear weapons 
we must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a 
decline in the nations enduring defense needs to deal with the 
enduring realities we face powell said 
the fourstar general said that although soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev remains very much in charge his policies 
are sowing the seed of his own weakness 
the soviet union will remain a superpower well into the next 
century powell said so even as we reduce we must maintain our 
ability to deter and defend he said 
powell said defense secretary dick cheneys plan released 
earlier this week to cut military forces by 25 percent over five 
years shows we are willing to examine any reasonable proposal 
but the general also defended president bushs 3033 billion 
spending plan for fiscal 1991 as a realistic prudent response 
to the changing world 
the administration budget blueprint powell said will begin to 
reduce the nations forces over time on this glide path we will 
reach a base force which i believe is not prudent to go below if we 
wish to match enduring defense needs with enduring realities 
powell said 
we know we will get smaller that is inevitable that is the 
correct thing to do powell said but if bushs budget request is 
cut back significantly you will force us to start breaking the 
back of our armed forces he said 
the general also took aim at lawmakers who are seeking more 
severe cuts over a shorter period of time although he named no 
names house armed services chairman les aspin dwis has been 
sharply critical of cheneys 25 percent plan and senate armed 
services chairman sam nunn dga has complained about strategic 
blanks in cheneys budget 
we are looking ahead with our eyes open were cutting 
programs we want to close bases weve frozen construction and 
hiring were cutting troops and believe it or not were cutting 
generals powell said 
what we need are not more insights on how to trim the margins 
what we need is breathing space we need to time to make the plans 
work powell said

a hardline critic of mikhail s gorbachev gained 
the most votes friday in the election for a new communist party 
chief in the russian federation and was favored to win the post in 
a runoff 
a victory by ivan polozkov could turn the communist party in the 
russian federation the soviet unions largest republic into a 
power base for conservatives it could also cause a split in the 
national communist party 
the new leader was expected to be named saturday 
polozkov received the most votes among seven nominees friday 
with 1017 to 848 for moderate oleg lobov soviet journalists 
predicted polozkov would win enough of the total 2633 votes from 
the defeated conservatives to triumph in the runoff 
technically all communists are automatically considered members 
of both the national and republic parties but a delegate from the 
volga river city of kuibyshev said the election of the conservative 
polozkov as head of the russian party could cause half the 
communists in his area to quit 
the national communist party congress meets in nine days to 
revamp its program and leadership and many expect it to split 
just three weeks ago radical reformer boris yeltsin was elected 
president of russia that gave gorbachev a strong rival on the 
other side 
it is not known if gorbachev and his centrists would side with 
conservatives with reformers or head out on their own 
but this weeks russian party congress made a gorbachev alliance 
with hardliners seem unlikely they repeatedly attacked the soviet 
presidents reforms and applauded speakers calling for gorbachevs 
replacement as head of the national party 
leaving the party job legally would not affect gorbachevs 
position as president of the soviet union 
the russian communist party was reestablished this week for the 
first time since 1925 at that time it was absorbed into the 
national party partly for fear its leaders could become competitors 
in the struggle for power russia contains half the soviet people 
more than half of its communists and threequarters of its land 
despite polozkovs harsh criticism of reform gorbachev backed 
him three weeks ago for president of the russian republic against 
populist reformer boris yeltsin in his campaign speech on 
thursday polozkov moderated his most extreme views 
adding to the confusion gorbachev was beaming friday laughing 
and joking at the russian party congress where he has been under 
severe attack by hardliners all week 
reformist vyacheslav bragin a communist party chief from 
kalinin told the congress before the vote if we elect polozkov 
it will mean the sunset of the party 
many delegates reacted to bragins speech which also criticized 
the military with derisive whistles gorbachev who presided over 
the proceedings quieted the delegates down but also rebuked bragin 
for fostering confrontation 
lobov 53 an ethnic russian construction engineer and a member 
of the national parliament supports gorbachevs proposed party 
platform and favors transferring power from the party to the 
government 
in his campaign speech he said his bywords include dont 
panic and there are no unsolvable problems 
the government daily izvestia said he believes the party should 
have a dialogue with its opponents and cooperation with local 
governing bodies 
polozkov 55yearold party chief in the southern russian region 
of krasnodar has called for strict party discipline and has 
complained that older party members are not respected 
he also has condemned informal political groups and has become 
famous for warring against the small private businesses legalized 
by gorbachev 
on wednesday he rejected reformers calls for the party to 
apologize for decades of dictatorship 
the 2700 communists of the russian congress will be the 
majority of the 4700 delegates at next months national party 
congress reformers have complained they were bypassed in the 
selection of delegates

a controversial study by aids activists of 
a chinese herbal treatment has produced promising early signs of 
stopping the aids viruss lethal destruction of blood cells its 
organizer said friday 
the treatment called compound q is being tested by a community 
group outside the usual control of medical schools and hospitals 
that ordinarily evaluate new medicines 
at this stage we have seen a major and dramatic change in 
what happens to these patients said martin delaney 
delaney director of san franciscos project inform said his 
group wanted to speed up the timeconsuming process of figuring out 
whether potential aids drugs work 
however some experts said the groups data is of limited value 
in assessing compound q and one prominent physician called delaney 
irresponsible for releasing his conclusion without providing data 
to back it up 
delaney described his groups work at the sixth international 
conference on aids 
compound q a protein derived from an herbal plant root is also 
being tested by researchers at the university of california san 
francisco but doctors there said its too soon to say whether the 
treatment is worthwhile 
dr james kahn who is conducting that study said delaneys 
work doesnt invite scientific scrutiny but it helps us focus on 
whats important 
kahn also cautioned that compound q can have toxic even fatal 
side effects this is a very dangerous drug he said 
in their experiment project inform has tested compound q on 46 
patients for 116 days before the treatment their helper t cells 
the primary target of the aids virus had been steadily declining 
but after treatment the loss stopped or even reversed itself in 38 
of them 
delaney cautioned that his work does not prove that compound q 
will be an effective aids drug but he said we dont see 
anything like this with azt the only aids drug now approved for 
routine use 
he did not reveal basic information about the study such as 
other drugs the patients were taking how sick they were or how 
they were recruited 
you are irresponsible in making such statements without 
providing your data said dr arnold relman editor of the new 
england journal of medicine we dont know if this is just 
another flash in the pan or something great 
dr dan hoth director of the division on aids at the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases said he did not 
consider delaney to be irresponsible but he said he worried about 
what sick people would make of his conclusions 
i fear that patients because they are so desperate will 
grasp at this he said we simply dont know we havent 
reviewed it 
joel thomas a patient taking compound q said he thought the 
medicine had made a dramatic difference for him 
it has literally turned my health around thomas said 
there is a clear regression of the disease 
compound q appears to work by attacking infected macrophages 
these blood cells which eat germs and debris in the bloodstream 
become virusmaking factories when they are invaded by hiv the 
aids virus

israel will not wait for us help in arranging 
peace talks but will try on its own to find palestinians willing to 
negotiate without the blessing of the plo officials said friday 
all such efforts have failed in the past and prominent 
palestinians say the new quest is doomed without the approval of 
yasser arafats palestine liberation organization 
yossi ben aharon a top policy adviser to prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said israel was not dependent on the united states to 
arrange a dialogue with palestinians 
we do not need to wait for mediation we will try to reach out 
to palestinians he said in an interview we will not rely on 
one channel to try to do things that can be done by israel 
the effort by israels new rightwing cabinet comes after the 
last government collapsed when its liberal and conservative members 
split over accepting us proposals for opening israelipalestinian 
talks in cairo egypt 
secretary of state james a baker iii wanted to include 
palestinians that have been deported by israel as a compromise to 
plo demands that palestinians not living in the occupied lands be 
included in the delegation but shamir said this amounted to 
indirect plo control 
ben aharon disputed bakers statement thursday that any dialogue 
needs plo acquiesence 
we are going to make a determined effort to convince our 
palestinians here that the plo option is not available he said 
we have been seeking peace for 42 years and no one has come 
forward its a long haul but there is no alternative 
palestinian sources said defense minister moshe arens has 
already sought to arrange meetings with influential palestinians to 
explore the prospects for a formal dialogue but most efforts to 
even talk about talks have failed 
arens spokesman dan naveh said the goal of such talks was making 
progress toward israels proposal for elections in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
he refused to say whether arens had succeeded in arranging any 
meetings but denied palestinian claims that he was refused by 
hilmi hanoun mayor of the west bank town of tulkarem 
mansur alshawwa a gaza businessman said he met with brig 
gen arieh ramot head of the armyrun government in gaza 
he told me that israel is working towards building up a new 
generation of palestinians who are willing to talk with israel 
without any ok from the plo he said 
alshawwa said he might agree to meet shamir or arens but did 
not believe israel would find much support among gazas 750000 
palestinians 
palestinians have resisted more than 20 years of efforts by 
israel to create an alternative leadership to the plo 
since the palestinian uprising began 30 months ago palestinians 
who cooperate with israel have come under attack some 225 
palestinians have been killed by other palestinians most on 
suspicion of being informers 
ben aharon said it may be impossible to find palestinian 
partners unless the united states completely severs its dialogue 
with the plo 
president bush on wednesday suspended the 18monthold dialogue 
when the group failed to condemn an aborted terrorist attack on 
israel may 30 abu abbas a member of the plo executive committee 
and a leader of a plo faction claimed responsibility 
benaharon said that by suspending the talks instead severing 
them the united states has not shut the door it has just shut 
the window

virginia gov douglas wilder the first 
black elected governor campaigned friday in the state that breeds 
presidential dreams but insisted he was here to stump for iowa 
democrats 
wilder was appearing around the state friday and saturday to 
campaign for don avenson the democrat seeking to unseat republican 
gov terry branstad and other candidates 
he conceded one goal of his tour would be to speak about what 
i think is taking place around the country in terms of people 
recognizing the need to have voices articulating what the new 
mainstream is 
the new mainstream is a key wilder theme one that enabled 
him to win election in a southern state that is just 19 percent 
black many democrats view wilder as a less threatening national 
candidate than the more charismatic and radical jesse jackson 
as to who belongs to the new mainstream there are any number 
of those persons around and id like to think im one of those 
persons wilder said 
wilder insisted he would serve out the fouryear term as 
virginia governor to which he was elected in november 
ive only been elected for six months and i dont think ive 
established a sufficient enough record of accountability as a chief 
executive to talk about trying to lead a nation said wilder 
nevertheless he said it isnt too early for others to talk 
about the 1992 campaign wilder had harsh criticism for some 
leading democratic contenders who seem to be keeping a low profile 
in light of president bushs high approval ratings 
i think its bad i think its a mistake to believe that you 
can sit out for four years and come back and be a leader four years 
later said wilder for instance in 1992 you say well just 
sit back and wait because who wants to run against an incumbent 
its difficult its hard in 1996 ill be your leader 
the people need leadership now said wilder this is one 
of the reasons im hoping we can frame the issues force the 
dialogue 
asked how reporters should judge his visit to the state whose 
caucuses kick off the presidential season wilder said i guess 
im a politician i guess youll have to judge me that way trust 
me im here for the purposes of electing a good man governor

japan surpassed the united states to become the 
worlds largest donor of foreign aid in 1989 providing nearly 9 
billion in official development assistance the foreign ministry 
said friday 
the 896 billion that japan supplied to poor nations was down 
19 percent from the previous year in dollar terms but still put 
japan in the no 1 position the ministry said 
in yen terms japans contributions to developing countries 
increased by 56 percent according to organization of economic 
cooperation and development statistics cited by the ministry 
among the key donor nations in the 24member oecd however 
japan ranked 12th in the percentage of its gross national product 
spent on development aid at 032 percent identical to the previous 
year norway and denmark were in first and second place at 102 and 
1 percent respectively the oecd said 
the united states previously the top donor provided 766

495 billion and italy with 333 billion it said 
foreign ministry officials said japan would continue to boost 
its aid budget in yen terms but that a fiveyear aid plan calling 
for more than 50 billion in assistance in 198892 might be hard to 
fulfill because of exchange rate fluctuations the kyodo news

the bush administration brushed aside nelson 
mandelas support for antiamerican leaders and said friday that 
his meetings here next week will focus on negotiations to end 
apartheid in south africa 
president bush and other administration officials will ask 
mandela on monday about his road map for negotiations with the 
white minority government assistant secretary of state herman 
cohen told reporters 
cohen who heads the departments africa affairs bureau said he 
believes agreement will be reached soon on releasing south african 
political prisoners and that the administration wants to know 
mandelas view on subsequent steps in the democratization process 
what happens after that he asked who sits at table what 
would be the format what are his mandelas constitutional 
ambitions what are his economic models 
cohen spoke as the african national congress leader wound up a 
tumultuous threeday visit to new york and prepared to head for 
boston 
cohen said he disagreed with the statements of support mandela 
has made for cuban president fidel castro libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi and palestine liberation organization chairman yasser 
arafat 
all have been accused by the united states of engaging in 
terrorist activities but mandela said the three support our 
struggle to the hilt he declined to criticize their humanrights 
record 
we feel that one cannot fail to take into account the human 
rights records in their own countries cohen said just to feel 
that these are good people because they are helping your cause we 
think is an insufficient response to human rights violations 
mandelas observations on gadhafi castro and arafat wont be a 
central element in mondays talks cohen said 
mandela has said repeatedly the united states must retain the 
sanctions it has imposed against south africa to do otherwise 
would ease the pressure on the south african government to 
dismantle apartheid he has said 
cohen said the sanctions will remain in place because south 
africa has not met the congressionally mandated requirements for 
lifting them 
he said he does not see sanctions as an important issue during 
the 2 hours mandela will spend with bush and a subsequent meeting 
with secretary of state james a baker iii 
sanctions cohen said are not a key element of the talks 
the administration he said hopes to get clues from mandela on how 
it can best support negotiations on ending apartheid

west european leaders will be put to 
the test at an upcoming summit to see if they can fall behind a 
common approach to eastwest relations a top official of the 
european community said friday 
it is very important that the european community should have 
an overall vision of the way in which it wants europe to develop 
said jacques delors president of the trading blocs executive 
agency 
he told reporters the 12nation community must show that it can 
be as firm dynamic and convincing in this area as it is in 
economic and monetary fields 
the main test of the summit opening monday in dublin 
ireland will be the leaders ability to come up with a similar 
analysis of the changes under way on their continent and how to 
deal with them he said 
the test he said is to see whether the officials are able 
to respond to the challenges of a new international situation 
the community should unite behind common positions in 
preparation for a 35nation summit in paris in december he said 
the gathering will be held as part of the conference on security 
and cooperation in europe a forum used in the past for discussing 
human rights issues 
without a united approach delors said he was concerned that 
the sirens at the summit may pull them one way or another a 
reference to a variety of proposals being offered for reshaping 
europe 
he also said the leaders would discuss at the dublin meeting 
whether they should put together an aid package to help soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev rescue his failing economic reform 
program 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois 
mitterrand have urged their colleagues to discuss the issue at the 
summit 
delors declined to elaborate on possible options for the 
kremlin he said the executive body the european commission was 
waiting to see how and on what terms the leaders wish to tackle 
this matter 
we will be ready he said we have our ideas on this 
the commission was put in charge last summer of an effort by two 
dozen western countries to help poland and hungary the program 
will be expanded next month to include some other emerging 
democracies in eastern europe 
some officials believe it is unlikely that the soviet union 
would be brought into that program because of the countrys 
enormous size and extent of its economic woes

republicans on friday tried to inflict 
political pain on democrats whose votes defeated president bushs 
constitutional amendment against flag desecration 
the house the socalled peoples body has said no to the 
millions of concerned americans who believe that old glory deserves 
one type of protection only and thats cultural protection 
said sen bob dole rkan the senate minority leader 
these guys are tone deaf to cultural anger said rep newt 
gingrich rga the house republican whip 
the house on thursday voted 254177 for the amendment 34 votes 
short of the twothirds required to send the proposed change in the 
constitution to the states 
democrats who led the opposition glowed in their victory over 
what they termed as an assault on the bill of rights majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo even suggested that speaker thomas 
s foley dwash and others join the honor roll beside 
thomas jefferson and james madison 
what we defeated was a rather homely form of politics that 
will sacrifice anything even our hallowed constitution to air an 
ad defeat a candidate or grasp for power he said 
within minutes after thursdays vote gop campaign operatives 
sent out press releases attacking democrats who voted against the 
amendment 
gingrich told reporters friday that the democrats have totally 
misunderstood america and republicans would make that point in 
this falls elections 
foleys leadership on the flag issue was an extraordinary 
mistake politically he said 
gingrich said he and house minority leader bob michel rill 
were meeting with veterans groups to enlist their help in defeating 
democrats who voted against the amendment 
youre going to see a systematic effort to use it and i think 
its going to be effective in some places he said especially 
when combined with other issues republicans contend show a 
lawmakers values 
its not a killer issue by itself its not going to beat 
anybody but for somebody whose values are in question anyway he 
said it could make the difference 
although the house action killed the amendments chances for 
this year the senate is expected to start debate on monday and is 
looking to vote tuesday night 
the gop hopes to take over the senate this fall from the 
democrats who now hold a 5545 majority and could make the no 
votes of liberal democrats a factor in the races 
sen tom harkin diowa who has said he would oppose the flag 
amendment and who faces a challenge from rep thomas tauke riowa 
on friday introduced a bill to foster public education about the 
flag 
but dole said the choice would be very simple 
we can either follow the houses lead and embrace the beltway 
knowitalls or we can embrace the will of the american people 
dole said

the gesture is unlikely to make a dent in the 
federal deficit but the maker of a new board game called read my 
lips thought it might be able to sell a few more games if it 
offered to contribute 
pressman toy corp of new york has pledged to donate 1 from the 
sale of each 17 game to the federal government to help reduce the 
nations deficit 
the board game whose title was the campaign rallying cry for 
president bush in his pledge not to raise taxes involves one 
partner trying to guess the words being mouthed by another 
to promote its move the company sent copies of the game to bush 
and reporters in washington 
buyers have to send the company their sales receipts and a game 
scorecard to put the donation into effect said pressman spokesman 
mark kulkis 
the promotion is good from june 25 through july 4 to give the 
gimmick an independence day angle 
the money that is collected will go to the bureau of the public 
debt in washington the agency that accepts donations to reduce the 
152 billion deficit said kulkis 
he said the company asked whether bush would agree to be 
photographed receiving a check for the amount raised and perhaps 
play a couple rounds of the game 
but its unlikely that bush will ever see the game sent to him 
or receive the check in person 
the company received a reply from joe hagin a deputy assistant 
to the president instructing that the game be sent to the white 
house gift room the cemetery for unsolicited gifts that come 
to the president from the public said kulkis

the percentage of delayed passenger flights 
has not improved since 1987 when airlines first were required to 
disclose their performance a congressional study said friday 
the study by the general accounting office criticizes the 
government reporting system for failing to show how late flights 
are and said some flights are not accurately reported by the 
airlines 
since september 1987 ontime performance logged by the 
transportation departments monthly reports has ranged from a low 
of 66 percent in december 1987 to a high of 86 percent in september 
1988 the data is based on reports airlines are required to file 
with the government 
in 1988 20 percent of all flights were late last year late 
flights increased to 24 percent the gao said 
airline industry and government officials agree that most flight 
delays are due to poor weather and that airport congestion is a 
growing factor delays generally are greater in winter months 
transportation secretary samuel skinner on thursday said that if 
something is not done about airport capacity the number of 
airports experiencing 20000 annual hours of delay will increase 
from 21 now to 39 by 1997 
a flight is considered on time if it departs or arrives within 
15 minutes of its scheduled time 
delays due to mechanical problems are not counted and the gao 
said the department does little to verify information about the 
23000 such flights each month thats about 5 percent of scheduled 
flights 
the gao study said that the departments inspector general found 
last year that a tracing of sample flights of 12 major airlines 
showed that of 3903 flights excluded from delay statistics because 
of mechanical problems 564 should have been reported 
the study also said about 4700 flights a month are cancelled 
for nonmechnical reasons but are reported simply as late flights 
and put in the same category as those running more than 15 minutes 
behind 
some of the nonmechanical cancellations the gao said are 
caused when a flight is cancelled for mechanical problems and other 
flights schedules are adjusted to accommodate the most passengers 
possible 
the gao recommended changes in the reporting system to include 
the reasons for nonmechanical delays

the interior department citing evidence the 
northern spotted owl may become extinct ordered the reclusive bird 
protected friday as a threatened species putting thousands of 
logging jobs into jeopardy 
the decision was expected to dramatically curtail logging across 
millions of acres of virgin forests in the pacific northwest where 
intense clearing of ancient trees over decades has destroyed the 
owls habitat and put its survival into question 
but the government said the regions jobs complicated the issue 
and postponed an announcement of a specific owl recovery plan on 
what logging restrictions will be required to protect the brown 
bird an announcement on the forest management plan was expected 
next week 
the biological evidence says that the northern spotted owl is 
in trouble said john turner director of the fish and wildlife 
service who made the decision to declare the owl threatened under 
the endangered species act 
we will not and by law cannot ignore that evidence 
industry and government estimates said as many as 28000 timber 
industry jobs could be lost in the next decade and entire logging 
communities disrupted by restrictions to protect the owl 
environmentalists who have fought to protect the owl say those 
estimates are exaggerated 
our intention now is to find ways to protect the owl with the 
least possible disruption to the timber economy in the pacific 
northwest said turner he said he is convinced there is room 
to protect both the owl and loggers 
the estimated 3000 to 5000 pairs of remaining northern spotted 
owls are scattered in oldgrowth forest in washington oregon and 
northern california an area that also accounts for by far the 
largest supply of lumber in this country 
the decision brought mixed response from congress 
sen patrick leahy dvt said the designation recognizes the 
mistakes of the past which allowed massive clearcutting of our 
last remaining ancient forests 
but congressmen from the northwest states urged that loggers and 
the local communities not be forgotten in developing an owl 
recovery plan 
we have to protect the environment and maintain the livelihood 
of our people finding the balance will be difficult said 
sen mark hatfield rore adding that every man woman and 
child in his state is going to be affected by the decision 
some environmentalists meanwhile cautioned that the future of 
the bird may depend on how aggressively the bush administration 
seeks to curtail timber cutting in owl recovery plan 
our concern is if they do not put appropriate restrictions 
on timber harvesting todays listing decision will be gutted and it 
will be meaningless said frances hunt of the national wildlife 
federation 
turner said compelling evidence shows that the spotted owl is 
at risk of extinction if current logging practices continue and 
more forest is destroyed in the three states 
although the decision to protect the owl is expected to have 
widespread impact on logging turner said he does not foresee 
significant disruption of this summers harvesting of northwest 
timber 
planned logging is going to go on and with very little 
disruption said turner timber cutting under current contracts 
with the government would proceed he said the effective date of 
turners listing of the owl as threatened goes into effect july 23 
about 90 percent of the remaining spotted owls live in forests 
owned by the federal government and managed by either the us 
forest service or interiors bureau of land management 
interior secretary manuel lujan and agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter are to announce next tuesday a plan aimed at 
protecting the owl on the government lands and at the same time 
reduce the disruption to logging communities our plan will 
be to achieve a balance said interior spokesman steve goldstein 
the management plan which is envisioned to include curbs on 
logging must be approved by the fish and wildlife service to 
assure it provides protection to the bird private landowners 
seeking to cut in areas where the owl lives will also have to take 
steps to limit the impact on owl habitat officials said 
designation of a species as threatened makes it illegal to harm 
any of the owls or destroy their critical habitat without federal 
government approval a threatened species is one that is likely to 
become endangered in the foreseeable future it is afforded similar 
protections as species classified as endangered 
the protection applies to owl on both private and government 
land under some circumstances private land owners may petition to 
cut in areas occupied by the owl federal agencies may not allow 
cutting on federal lands unless a tree harvesting plan has been 
approved by the fish and wildlife service 
the decision to protect the owl represents a reversal by the 
fish and wildlife service which for many years refused to list the 
bird and had to be forced by a federal court in 1988 to reconsider 
the status of the owl

rival christian forces clashed with 
artillery and mortars in east beirut on friday killing a young 
girl and a french envoy continued trying to mediate an end to the 
4monthold conflict 
police said three other women including the dead girls sister 
were wounded in predawn fighting between troops of rebel gen 
michel aoun and militiamen led by samir geageas lebanese forces 
before it died down 
the sisters were hit when a mortar round fired by aouns 
gunners landed on their house in east beiruts sin elfil 
district controlled by the lebanese forces 
by police count 1044 people have been killed and 2789 wounded 
since the aoungeagea power struggle for control of the small 
christian enclave broke out jan 30 
the fighting has forced more than 400000 of the enclaves 1 
million inhabitants to flee to safer areas or leave the country 
french envoy francois scheer on friday crossed from west beirut 
where he met with government leaders into the christian sector of 
the divided lebanese capital to meet with aoun 
scheer briefed aoun on the reactions of syrian and lebanese 
leaders to frances sixday effort to implement an arab 
leaguebrokered peace pact to end lebanons 15yearold civil war 
between christians and moslems 
he later returned to west beirut to catch a plane bound for 
paris 
shortly before his departure scheer said he conveyed to 
president elias hrawis government proposals from aoun he refused 
to disclose further details 
scheer directorgeneral of frances foreign ministry arrived 
in beirut late monday the christian rivals have been fighting 
continually since then despite a nominal monthold ceasefire 
scheer held a series of meetings with lebanese leaders then made

to implement the accord which shares power equally between the 
longdominant christians and moslems now 55 percent of the 4 
million population 
aoun refuses to recognize hrawi and rejects the peace accord 
because it does not guarantee the withdrawal of 40000 syrian 
troops in lebanon since 1976 under an arab league peacekeeping 
mandate 
the generals actions have blocked hrawis efforts to extend his 
authority to the christian enclave and put constitutional reforms 
into effect 
geagea whose militia is the largest christian private army in 
lebanon has recognized hrawi and termed the peace accord a 
gateway to national reconciliation

an attorney for the city government testified 
in marion barrys drug and perjury trial friday that he found the 
mayor slumped one night in a bathroom littered with drug 
paraphernalia 
the smoke and the smell got stronger as the evening 
went on said james mcwilliams recalling a december 1988 night 
he spent with barry and key prosecution witness charles lewis at a 
washington hotel room 
mcwilliams who is cooperating with prosecutors after pleading 
guilty to drugrelated charges backed up testimony from lewis 
about the evening of alleged crack cocaine use by the threeterm 
mayor 
mcwilliams said he went to lewis room that night to discuss a 
job transfer with the mayor but the bearded mcwilliams said that 
as he pressed his case barry just told him at one point you 
know you look a lot like santa claus 
a legal counsel for the citys department of public works 
mcwilliams testified he helped lewis and barry hide the alleged 
drug use from police investigators because i was protecting 
marion barry 
barry 54 is facing three felony charges of perjury 10 
misdemeanor charges of cocaine possession and one misdemeanor count 
of conspiracy to possess cocaine he has pleaded innocent 
lewis a convicted drug dealer testified earlier this week that 
he used drugs with barry repeatedly between 1986 and 1988 and 
smoked crack cocaine with him on four occasions in lewis 
washington room including dec 19 1988 
mcwilliams said he went to lewis room that night to talk 
discuss a job transfer with the mayor but lewis first asked 
mcwilliams for 40 to got out and get some stuff mcwilliams 
testified 
i understood he was going to go out and get some drugs with 
the money said mcwilliams lewis came back with a plastic bag 
that had a white substance inside he said 
barry who he said arrived later then went repeatedly with 
lewis into the bathroom and kitchen smoke and a strong unusual 
smell from the bathroom grew as mcwilliams watched monday night

asked assistant us attorney richard roberts 
that this is good stuff i will go back and have another 
hit replied mcwilliams quoting barry and lewis 
mcwilliams a former assistant attorney general in the virgin 
islands said he tried to talk to barry about the job transfer but 
i didnt think i was getting through 
in the bathroom an armslength from the mayor a vanity was 
littered with matches white residue in a plastic bag and a 
tinfoilcovered glass testified mcwilliams 
the mayor appeared restful peaceful mcwilliams said he 
was sitting on the commode and he was just slumped over a little 
bit i kept making my pitch about the job 
he looked up and said you know you look a lot like santa 
claus testified mcwilliams whose beard is heavily streaked 
with gray 
mcwilliams never said however that he saw barry using drugs 
mcwilliams said he didnt use drugs himself 
mcwilliams also backed up parts of lewis testimony that lewis 
and the mayor conspired to hide their alleged acts as a police 
investigation closed in on lewis saying he acted as a gobetween 
for lewis and barry 
mcwilliams said he lied to police when detectives interviewed 
him about his visit to lewis room 
i didnt tell the truth because i was protecting marion 
barry he said barry was someone who i respected and the 
mayors services to the city and civil rights were something i 
considered important he testified 
testifying after mcwilliams a longtime friend of lewis said 
he hosted lewis over the christmas weekend in the days just after 
barry and lewis found out about the police investigation

six months after the violent 
revolution that overthrew communist dictator nicolae ceausescu his 
successor stood and wept friday by the graves of those killed in 
the fighting 
official observances and prayer services marked the halfyear 
anniversary of the revolution but among many romanians there was a 
sense of uncertainty about the future following last weeks 
crackdown on antigovernment demonstrators in which six people died 
and hundreds were injured 
ion iliescu sworn in as president on wednesday and premier 
petre roman laid wreaths at the young heroes cemetery where 
students and other young people killed in battles with ceausescus 
security forces are buried 
according to the official death toll at least 1033 people were 
killed in the december revolt 
at the cemetery in southwest bucharest the crowd observed a 
minute of silence as iliescu wept by the graves earlier he 
exchanged brief remarks with mourning relatives 
iliescu and radu campeanu leader of the opposition national 
liberal party were among those attending a memorial service at 
bucharests patriarhie cathedral 
patriarch teoctist spiritual leader of the romanian orthodox 
church told the worshipers that remembering the heroes of the 
revolution provides a moment of reflection over our consciousness 
and life 
despite betterstocked food stores and an influx of imported 
sony tv sets and jvc video recorders for the first time some 
people felt the revolutions aims were unfulfilled 
at least if we knew why these people had to die we do not 
really enjoy peace said iuliana vasiliu who mourned at the 
grave of her son florentin 37 
bucharest residents joined the revolution on dec 21 ceausescu 
was ousted on dec 22 and executed three days later together with 
his wife elena 
i do not think george would have been happy to see the latest 
developments said iolanda radulescu about her brother who was 
killed in december and buried in the young heroes cemetery 
he did not die just to see us hate and beat each other she 
said referring to the riots that started june 13 when police broke 
up a 53day antigovernment demonstration in bucharests main 
square 
the demonstrators had been demanding the ouster of iliescu 
accusing him and other government officials of being 
neocommunists iliescu was a former communist party secretary who 
fell into disfavor with ceausescu 
after angry crowds attacked official buildings iliescu appealed 
to workers to help defend the government thousands of loyalist 
miners heeded the appeal attacking political foes students and 
bystanders throughout bucharest 
in addition to the six dead more than 500 were injured the 
government said more than 1000 people were detained including 
student leaders most of whom have been released 
in another development friday ceausescus sister maria agache 
went on trial under charges of fraud involving public property and 
abuse of privilege 
a brief report by the state rompres news agency did not provide 
further details but knowledgeable romanians said ms agache had 
amassed a fortune by buying and selling property illegally 
her trial started a day after the supreme court sentenced 
nicolae andruta ceausescu a general and one of ceausescus five 
brothers to 15 years in prison for inciting mass murder and 
attempted aggravated murder during the revolution he had said he 
was innocent of charges that he shot at demonstrators in bucharest 
on dec 21

the northern spotted owls listing as a 
threatened species marks a dark day in the history of the pacific 
northwest leading loggers said friday 
environmentalists said the listing was long overdue adding they 
wanted to see what steps federal agencies would take to protect the 
uncut forests where the twofoottall brown bird lives 
the interior department citing evidence the owl may become 
extinct ordered the reclusive bird protected as a threatened 
species friday but it postponed until tuesday an announcement of a 
plan that will determine how much logging is to be permitted in the 
owls habitat 
the listing by itself will not protect the owl or the ancient 
forests said melanie rowland of the wilderness societys office 
in seattle the key is what the agencies are going to do and how 
much politics interferes with biology 
members of the northwest forest resource council which 
represents the timber companies and 131000 workers told a news 
conference they would seek to limit the bans on logging by 
emphasizing the economic impact of setting aside land for owls 
the government estimates that as many as 28000 timber industry 
jobs could be lost in the next decade in oregon washington and 
northern california entire logging communities could be disrupted 
by the logging restrictions 
the listing represents a dark day in the history of the 
pacific northwest said gary jones president of summit timber co 
while the endangered species act requires listing of a species 
be made on scientific evidence alone it has a provision that gives 
an endangered species committee including cabinet members and 
other state and federal officials the power to modify how the 
listing is enacted 
jones said the council was considering a lawsuit against the 
fish and wildlife service and would probably go to court if plans 
to protect the owl failed to provide sufficient protection for 
logging 
environmentalists said the declaration should mark the end of an 
era 
the timber frontier is over said rick johnson of the sierra 
club this is the clear indication where you cannot go over the 
next hillside and have something to cut we have a limited and 
finite timber base and we have to have some understanding of the 
consequences of what that logging will have 
people in the logging towns claim that environmental groups 
many of whose constituents are urban dwellers dont understand how 
damaging the decision will be to a way of life 
its like boeing leaving seattle what would that be like 
said jerry leppell president of the american loggers solidarity 
committee in forks 
timber is the leading industry in oregon and also is key in 
washington the governors of both states said they would lobby 
against overly strict owl recovery plans 
federal legislation is needed to protect some oldgrowth 
forests while allowing logging to continue without administrative 
delays in others said oregon gov neil goldschmidt 
gov booth gardner of washington said the ruling presents a 
challenge to the northwest clearly what the timber communities 
and workers need is assurance of an ongoing and adequate timber 
supply he said the federal government should provide special 
assistance to communities hurt by the decision 
according to a federal study at least 84 million acres of the 
timberlands should be preserved as habitat to save the owl from 
extinction the area is equivalent to a swath about 5 miles wide 
stretching from los angeles to new york city 
about 54 million acres of owl habitat already are in national 
parks or wilderness areas off limits to logging so an additional 3 
million acres would have to be withdrawn

two lawmakers who opposed one another on a 
constitutional amendment banning desecration of the flag joined 
forces friday to support a measure to end imports of us flags 
most of which come from taiwan 
rep john bryant dtexas voted against the proposed 
constitutional amendment on thursday rep harley o staggers jr 
dwva voted for it 
on wednesday they introduced a bill of their own to ban imported 
flags on thursday the proposed amendment failed to get the 
necessary threefourths vote in the house despite strong support 
from president bush 
at alamo flags in dallas texas a major dealer an employee 
said imported flags were much cheaper an aide to bryant said 90 
percent of them came from taiwan and smaller quantities from china 
and hong kong 
he added that when bush a fellow texan went into bryants 
district two years ago to campaign against him bush supporters 
were waving flags made in taiwan 
the senate will vote on the proposed amendment tuesday but its 
vote will have no practical effect and no further action on the 
propoal is likely this year the issue is expected to be widely 
used during the campaign leading to the congressional elections in 
november 
during the debate on thursday when it seemed likely that the 
proposed amendment would be defeated bryant and staggers sent 
letters to the other members of the house seeking cosponsors for 
their bill an aide to bryant said friday that there had been no 
response yet 
the bill would set up an official united states flag commission 
to regulate the manufacture and use of flags 
the commission may only grant a license to manufacture 
official flags of the united states if such flag will be 
manufactured in the united states the bill says 
the commerce department reported that the united states imported 
321877 flags in the first four months of this year more than 
twice as many as the 132667 brought in during all of 1989 
the bryantstaggers bill would punish with a 5000 fine the 
sale of a flag not made in the united states anyone already owning 
such a flag could submit it to the commission for designation as an 
official flag 
the bill also calls for a 1year prison sentence and a fine of 
5000 for anyone who knowingly mutilates burns tramples upon 
or otherwise damages an official flag of the united states the 
supreme court has declared unconstitutional two laws with similar 
provisions to this prompting the unsuccessful effort to pass a 
constitutional amendment 
the new bill says a flag may be burned if its no longer in 
condition for display

the soviet union said friday that a united 
germany would have the right to eventually join nato but only after 
a fiveyear transition period during which all soviet and us 
troops would leave the country 
the united states supported by the western allies rejected the 
plan as a delaying tactic 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze made the proposal during 
unification talks involving the four world war ii allies and the 
two german states 
shevardnadze also proposed pulling us soviet british and 
french troops out of berlin within six months of a german merger 
which could take place by the end of year 
at a news conference afterward shevarnadze said we would 
like to build a new europe without military confrontation 
but secretary of state james a baker iii told reporters the 
plan would leave berlin which is expected to become germanys 
capital again surrounded by 380000 soviet troops 
as for all of germany shevardnadze proposed a 50 percent 
reduction in foreign forces over five years from east and west 
germany and then over an unspecified period removing all of them 
except token contingents 
over a fiveyear transitional period shevardnadze said east 
and west germany would be obliged to maintain all concluded 
international treaties and agreements now in effect 
western diplomats interpreted this statement as a soviet attempt 
to delay nato membership for the merged germany 
however shevardnadze went on to say that afterward the 
united germany within its rights can conclude international 
agreements unhindered by other considerations he thereby gave 
approval to the germans right to join any alliance after the 
fiveyear period 
baker replied why not let the sovereign unified germany make 
that decision 
he said the withdrawal of foreign forces should not be imposed 
on the germans in the final settlement to be worked out by the 
allies the united states britain france and soviet union and 
the east german and west german foreign ministers 
the question of a united germanys military stance is the 
biggest obstacle to that agreement the united states wants the new 
country to be a member of the western alliance nato the soviet 
union opposes nato membership for germany 
currently west germany is in nato and east germany is a member 
of the sovietled warsaw pact 
shevardnadzes plan would have the effect of delaying full 
sovereignty for a united germany since during the fiveyear 
transition period it could not declare itself a member of nato 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said us 
officials objected to the fiveyear time limit before germany could 
join nato the official said the other western ministers expressed 
the same reservations 
a senior west german official speaking on condition of 
anonymity told reporters his government was opposed to a 
transition period but that there might be room for a windingdown 
process 
a senior british offical also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that everyone rejected the idea of a transition 
period 
the british official said that a united germany must have full 
sovereignity and not be subject to discriminatory treatment 
despite the disagrement shevardnadze said he expected the 
allies would reach agreement on german unification by the end of 
this year the two german nations already are planning joint 
elections for december 
on another difficult issue the ministers agreed to meet in 
paris on july 17 to consider polands concern about its border with 
germany poland is concerned that lands ceded to it from germany 
after world war ii may be lost to reunification 
shevardnadze said his proposal regarding troops on german soil 
was an outline on which the kremlin was prepared to compromise it 
also contained the following provisions 
1 the united germany must not produce possess receive or 
deploy nuclear chemical or biological weapons 
2 the four power occupation of berlin that has existed since 
world war ii would end within six months of the formation of a 
single german government 
3 the final settlement being drafted by the six nations should 
propose measures to limit the size of germanys armed forces 
4 nato and the warsaw pact would agree on a new code of conduct 
toward each other in which the two alliances no longer would be 
potential military adversaries

tamil separatist guerrillas hacked to 
death 62 moslem men women and children in eastern sri lanka on 
friday after accusing them of being government informants 
a defense ministry official and a moslem leader said the village 
massacre at nintavur came on the 11th day of an increasingly 
violent war between tamil guerrillas and sri lankan forces for 
control of the northeast the separatists are also believed to have 
gunned down 278 unarmed policemen last week 
in the north rebel forces overran one army base and attacked 
four other strategic government garrisons ethnic strife between 
tamils and sinhalese spread to south and central sri lanka 
military officials said at least 139 more people died in fighting 
that has already left more than 1400 people dead 
the government announced more than 210000 people had fled the 
bloodshed seeking shelter in temporary refugee camps in schools 
temples churches and mosques across sri lanka 
troops found the bodies of 62 moslem men women and children in 
nintavur a village 28 miles south of batticaloa town a defense 
ministry statement said corpses were found floating inside water 
wells 
military officials said rebels used knives to kill the villagers 
instead of guns so the noise wouldnt alert security forces posted 
nearby 
survivors said the rebels raided the village early friday 
because they feared villagers would reveal the site of their jungle 
hideout according to mahroof gani an official of the sri lanka 
moslem congress an opposition party 
earlier this week government attacks in the east pushed the 
rebels into the jungle 
it was a slaughter of innocent moslem men women and 
children gani said calling the rebels bloodthirsty 
criminals 
he said after killing villagers the rebels set fire to a 
mosque looted and burned down the villages 150 houses and left 
placards written in red paint warning moslems not to work for the 
government 
the government on thursday claimed its troops had captured the 
strategic east coast region from the tamil tigers who are fighting 
for a separate tamil homeland the rebels contend tamils are 
discriminated against by the sinhalese majority 
but an associated press reporter who visited the area on 
thursday and friday found the rebels appeared to control large 
parts of the region the coastal town of batticaloa which the 
government claimed to have captured was virtually deserted 
in batticaloa the threestory police station gutted by a fire 
set by tamil rebels was empty and shops were boarded up several 
people roamed the streets searching for food which residents say 
is running short after nearly two weeks of fighting 
government troops only controlled an airstrip on batticaloas 
outskirts on the roads rebels could be seen driving tractor 
trailers loaded with looted food soap and other essentials 
a 25yearold rebel leader who identified himself only as 
newton said the tigers had withdrawn from most of the major towns 
in the east and were readying for guerrilla war 
from now on there will be no negotiations we will ambush and 
attack government troops he said cocking his new chinesemade 
automatic rifle as he spoke to reporters in pullamalia a village 
near batticaloa 
eight miles away sinhalese police peered warily from their 
bunkers in maha oya no one was allowed in or out of the town 
without police permission 
tamil rebels took reporters on a tour of the east coast region 
in an effort to show they were still in control 
at periyaparativu a village 12 miles south of batticaloa most 
of the 300 homes were gutted rebels and some villagers claimed the 
homes had been destroyed by government troops before they withdrew 
when the army came here last week the people fled when they 
withdrew we returned said a 26yearold tamil university 
student 
the tamil tigers have been waging a sevenyear insurgency to set 
up a separate state in the north and east where tamils predominate 
the fighting flared again on june 11 when the rebels abrogated a 
13monthold ceasefire by attacking police stations after a tamil 
civilian complained he was manhandled by sinhalese police 
tamils who are predominantly hindu make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people the buddhist sinhalese comprise 75 
percent while moslems constitute seven percent

a 775 million plan to convert a 
vacant electronics mill into the worlds largest contemporary art 
museum is a risky venture that wont work a state official 
said 
in my view its not legal inspector general joseph barresi 
said friday in a telephone interview from his boston office 
barresi is responsible for pointing out fraud and waste in 
government 
in a report released thursday barresi said the city of north 
adams had no credible plan to raise the more than 10 million 
required as its share for the first phase of construction 
without that money the state cannot legally proceed with any 
spending for construction barresi said bids were scheduled to be 
let this year 
he also contended a proposed plan to have a private developer 
build the building and lease it to the museum is not allowed under 
massachusetts bidding laws and he warned that the venture could 
end up costing north adams taxpayers hundreds of thousands of 
dollars a year if attendance didnt meet optimistic 
projections of 150000 visitors a year 
two years ago the legislature authorized 35 million to help 
convert the vacant 28building sprague electronics co mill 
complex into an art museum but release of the money depends on 
acceptance of a feasibility study by state planning and finance 
officials as well as a museum commission 
local officials in north adams hope a museum to house 
ultracontemporary artworks many of them roomsized will boost the 
economy of this industrial town of 18000 critics question whether 
it could ever attract enough people to the town at least 2 hours 
by car from boston 
the idea of using the huge complex as an art museum was devised 
by thomas krens then director of the williams college art museum 
in nearby williamstown and now director of the solomon r 
guggenheim museum in new york an italian art collector count 
giuseppe panza di biuomo has said he is willing to make a 
longterm loan of 300 works to the museum 
state rep daniel bosley who represents north adams and 
strongly supports the museum plan criticized barresi for issuing 
his report 
its not his job to pass judgment on a project bosley said 
thats for others to do but bosley said he may seek to amend 
the enabling legislation to change the financing requirements to 
meet barresis objections 
krens was traveling abroad friday and could not be reached for 
comment on barresis criticisms while north adams mayor john 
barrett iii was not available for comment because of a death in his 
family his office said 
barresi said north adams taxpayers need to be aware that they 
museum is a risky venture the feasibility study relies on 
optimistic forecasts 
the study released in april contends upwards of 150000 people 
annually would be willing to travel to the town in the northern 
berkshires and pay 650 apiece to view ultramodern work such as a 
300foot sculpture of lighted neon tubes 
but the wellestablished clark art institute with free admission 
in nearby williamstown gets just 120000 visitors annually barresi 
said if the proposed museum got that many visitors 30000 fewer 
than its breakeven target it would run a 274000 deficit that 
would have to be made up by the taxpayers he said

100000ayear trading assistant at drexel burnham lambert inc 
was sentenced friday to 10 months in prison for lying to a grand 
jury investigating wall street fraud 
us district judge leonard b sand reduced the 18month 
sentence jones received last year after an appeals court threw out 
the term on grounds it was longer than mandated by federal 
sentencing guidelines 
sand also fined jones 25000 and ordered her to pay 14850 for 
the cost of her incarceration he required jones to receive mental

nothing to indicate she was suffering from diminished mental 
capacity at the time of her crimes 
jones who worked at drexels beverly hills calif junk bond 
department was the first person convicted in the governments

a taiwanese folk singer sent back home by 
china seven years after he defected to that country said friday he 
would have preferred to remain in beijing to continue criticizing 
the communist chinese leadership 
it was not my plan to come back to taiwan at this moment 
hou dejian told reporters one day after being released on bail by 
taiwanese authorities i wanted to stay in china and remain an 
acceptable reasonable dissident 
hou 34 and two others disappeared may 31 in beijing just hours 
before they were to issue an open letter to chinese leaders calling 
for the release of political prisoners 
the singer said chinese authorities had accused him of spreading 
rumors about the death toll in the june 1989 military crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing hundreds and perhaps 
thousands of people died 
hou said chinese authorities offered him a choice of either 
going to prison or being sent back to taiwan 
i didnt want to go to jail and i dont want to be 
irrational so i chose to come back hou told a news conference 
at a taipei hotel 
the two others seized gao xin and zhou duo resurfaced earlier 
this week in beijing gao said he had spent the two weeks 
vacationing under police supervision 
hou arrived in taiwan on wednesday aboard a fishing boat 
prosecutors said they would review hous case to determine if he 
entered taiwan illegally but premier hau peitsun indicated the 
folk singer would not be sent to jail 
since he turned himself in there shouldnt be any serious 
consequences the premier said friday 
hou was a popular folk singer in taiwan when he defected to 
china in 1983 in what he described as a move to seek his roots his 
father was a soldier in the nationalist army that retreated to 
taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to communist forces on the 
chinese mainland 
hou was one of four young intellectuals who staged a hunger 
strike in beijing during the prodemocracy movements final days 
following the military crackdown hou took refuge in the 
australian embassy in beijing for more than two months until the 
chinese government promised he would not be arrested 
after leaving the embassy he was one of the few chinese to 
continue to publicly call for democratic reform

for the 20 months after her aids diagnosis 
kathy and chris pitkin made the most of the life she had left by 
caring for her at home she lived well with aids instead of simply 
dying well with it 
the 20 months of care before her death in 1988 cost 150000 80 
percent of it for six hospital visits the cost of home care which 
helped extend and improve her life had to come out of pitkins 
pocket 
its one of the most frustrating things we face said merle 
sande chief of medicine at san francisco general hospital during 
a panel discussion friday in connection with the sixth 
international conference on aids 
we can get resources if you hospitalize a patient but to take 
care of them at home to focus on the quality of life to try to 
keep them out of the hospital you cant get support for it it 
doesnt make any sense 
as aids enters its second decade caregivers community aids 
groups and people infected with the deadly virus are talking about 
quality of life home care good nutrition and critical emotional 
support and how it can help lengthen life and give them a sense 
of control over a disease that often seems out of control 
its easier to see whats needed in the bigger picture than it 
is to find money to pay for it 
finding the resources to support it is almost harder to do 
than finding the resources to support what it takes to die well 
said jean mcguire executive director of the aids action council a 
washington dcbased lobbying group 
the council recently challenged the continuing reviews of social 
security and medicaid benefits of people with aids ironically 
current drug therapies were often improving the health of aids 
patients so dramatically that they were deemed no longer eligible 
for the benefits that had given them access the very medical care 
that had helped them she said 
kathleen squires was an intern at a philadelphia hospital in 
1981 when patients started popping up with an illness no one could 
identify 
by the time these patients presented at the hospital they 
never made it out of the hospital again said squires now 
assistant attending physician at new york hospital they were 
subjected to every test known to man and every kind of medication 
and in terms of quality of life there was none 
in many cases there still is none doctors have to begin 
incorporating those concerns into their mainstream care 
psychiatrist stuart nichols said 
we have to go beyond what doctors can do for patients we can 
help patients live longer and function better but quality of life 
ultimately depends on having the courage to look at your life and 
see if youre doing enough with it doing the kind of things you 
want said nichols of beth israel hospital in new york 
physicians tend to focus too narrowly on the negative aspects of 
aids he said 
if you ask most doctors about the basic psychological response 
to being diagnosed theyd tell you about the catastrophic reaction 
where your sense of who you are and where youre going is wiped 
out he said but they seem to forget entirely theres a 
second and more important phase where the patient emerges with 
a new sense of who they are a new sense of what they want to do 
with new friends new goals in life 
pitkin who learned he was hiv positive six years ago has all 
but abandoned the conservative lifestyle that found him pursuing an 
advanced business degree and socking away retirement money 
attitude is everything he believes 
thats the thing with aids its like death and dying and 
everythings going to hell he said lets get out and play 
some golf do some sailing and have some fun

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze responding to repeated urgings by the united states 
late friday gave new assurances that his government would keep 
allowing jews to leave the country 
shevardnadze however requested israel keep the refugees from 
settling on the occupied west bank or gaza strip territories 
we have very good reasons to insist shevardnadze said after 
a twohour meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii 
the session was held after a conference on germanys future 
attended also by the foreign ministers of britain france east 
germany and west germany 
before flying home to moscow the foreign minister said the 
soviet parliament would complete legislation establishing the right 
to emigrate 
that would meet a precondition set by the bush administration 
for lowering tariffs against soviet products 
baker raised the issue after soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev threatened to suspend jewish emigration which is now at 
an alltime high if some of the refugees are settled in the lands 
formerly held by jordan and egypt 
but shevardnadye told reporters as for our practice in regard 
to emigration nothing has changed 
two weeks ago shevardnadye gave similar assurances to baker 
during a meeting in copenhagen denmark but then gorbachev raised 
the possibility again as he had at the washington summit with bush 
that ended june 3

the us government friday night prepared to 
airlift blankets tents and other items for earthquake victims in 
iran after being informed by iranian authorities that american 
assistance would be welcome 
the relief items were to donated through the american red cross 
iran had informed the state department that it was willing to 
accept contributions from that agency or similar private 
organizations 
the state department said the goods valued at 225000 were to 
be flown via charter from a us government logistics base near 
pisa italy the charter cost was listed at 66000 
we want to be helpful without regard for our political 
differences with iran said deputy spokesman richard boucher 
iranian officials put the death toll at more than 36000 
the state department said the us contribution would consist of 
1000 hard hats 1000 leather gloves 10000 face masks 2940 
wool blankets 160 5gallon water jugs and 800 tents 
meanwhile in stamford conn the americares relief 
organization said it would send a medical team and 80000 pounds of 
supplies to iran on saturday 
we really cant be perceived as so bad if we reach out to the 
people there said terry tarnowski who has worked for americares 
since it was founded in 1982 
there have been only rare instances of usiranian cooperation 
since the two countries broke diplomatic relations a decade ago 
the united states holds iran partly responsible for the continued 
detention of american hostages by proiranian groups in lebanon 
boucher said iran told the us government that private donor 
agencies should contact the iranian red crescent society a 
humanitarian group that is the conduit for all outside assistance 
the us government routinely channels humanitarian assistance 
through the red cross and other donor groups 
pat davis a spokeswoman for the american red cross said the 
agency has donated 50000 in cash and is accepting cash donations 
for the purchase of blankets medicines clothes and flashlights 
she said checks payable to iran relief can be sent to the 
american red cross po box 37243 washington dc 20013 checks 
also can be sent to local red cross chapters 
boucher said the iranian message to the united states presumably 
was delivered through a third party but added that he was 
uncertain messages between the two countries normally are handled 
by the swiss embassy in tehran 
the type of help us charitable groups could send would be 
based on the recommendations of a un disaster relief team that 
has been sent to the affected area 
the iranian message came a day after the bush administration 
responded to the tragedy in the northwest part of the country with 
a message of condolences and an offer of humanitarian aid 
iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries 
except israel and south africa us officials said an american 
offer of aid after an earlier natural disaster in iran was rejected

largescale testing of aids vaccines could 
begin in two years and a vaccine could be widely available by the 
middle of the 1990s researchers said friday 
in an address at the sixth international conference on aids dr 
jay a berzofsky of the national cancer institute said the most 
effective vaccines will probably be synthetic made through 
recombinant dna technology or genetic engineering 
were now in a position to take advantage of recent advances 
in immunology to design an artificial vaccine berzofsky said 
and it should be possible to develop such a vaccine in the near 
future 
near the moscone center convention hall more than 200 
protesters mostly women gathered in the latest of a string of 
daily demonstrations sponsored by act up the aids coalition to 
unleash power 
more than 140 people were arrested when the group of 
demonstrators marched from near the convention hall into the center 
of an intersection and lay down in a symbolic diein 
another group of 100 activists demonstrated friday afternoon in 
front of the hall of justice 
fridays demonstration focused on what act up contends is the 
exclusion of women children and minorities from research 
treatment and other services 
many protesters bound themselves to metal barricades with 
symbolic red paper chains chanting women die faster this is a 
disaster and waved signs reading health care now women gets 
aids too and prostitutes make safe sex their business 
catherine ritter a new york woman who said she has aids said 
ive been denied access to clinical trials ive been denied 
medical treatment 
inside the conference the aids vaccine group led by dr jonas 
salk reported that the salk aids vaccine has boosted immunity in 
about 60 percent of the 82 people with aids virus infections who 
have so far received it 
the vaccine is intended not to prevent the aids infection but 
to ward off disease in people already infected 
none have died up to twoandahalf years after being given the 
vaccine said alexandra m levine of the university of southern 
california three developed the aidsrelated cancer kaposis 
sarcoma one developed pneumonia and another developed an eye 
infection she said 
the results were encouraging enough for the researchers to 
announce that largescale trials of the vaccine will begin in 
several months with the approval of the us food and drug 
administration 
a san francisco community research group also reported 
improvement in aids patients given a drug called compound q 
derived from a chinese herb 
before being given the drug the patients suffered a steady 
decline in immune system cells called cd4 cells after 
administration of the drug to 46 patients 38 of the patients 
showed either a stabilization of cd4 cells or an increase said the 
studys director martin delaney 
at this stage we have seen a major and dramatic change in 
what happens to these patients delaney said but he said he 
could not yet recommend that the drug be taken widely because of 
potentially dangerous side effects 
wayne koff chief of the aids vaccine research branch at the 
national institute of allergy and infectious diseases said the 
most promising human vaccines should be ready for largescale 
testing in two or three years and it will take two or three more 
years to determine their effectiveness 
so were still looking at the midtolate 1990s as a minimal 
time frame for selection of a vaccine for general use koff said 
i think there is reason to be more optimistic now in 1990 
than at any previous international aids conference he sid 
some 30 approaches toward the development of vaccines are now 
being studied koff said half a dozen vaccines are already being 
tested or are about to be tested in humans he said 
optimism about an aids vaccine is spurred by recent successes 
with vaccines in animals said dr murray b gardner of the 
university of california davis 
in massachusetts two of six monkeys given vaccines did not get 
infected when exposed to the simian aids virus in louisiana 
vaccines prevented infection in eight of nine vaccinated monkeys 
at gardners primate research center three of three monkeys 
vaccinated were protected against infection 
it should not be too long before these laboratorysuccessful 
vaccines can be translated into hiv vaccines for the real world 
gardner said hiv is the virus that causes aids 
even if human vaccines arent successful in protecting humans 
against disease they might well delay the onset of serious 
symptoms of aids gardner said 
the animal vaccines tested were socalled wholevirus vaccines 
they consist of killed aids viruses injected to trigger an immune 
response that can defend against live aids virus 
the danger in using such vaccines with humans however is that 
there is some risk they will inadvertently transmit the disease 
because they contain intact aids viruses researchers said 
because a synthetic vaccine would lack viral components it 
could not inadvertently cause aids said berzofsky furthermore 
such a vaccine could be designed to stimulate only those parts of 
the immune system known to attack the aids virus he said 
stimulation of other parts of the immune system could actually 
intensify an aids infection because those immune cells are 
infected with the aids virus he said

other ties with belgium on friday in response to brussels

zaire over the may 12 massacre of students at the university of 
lubumbashi 
on friday zaires president mobutu sese seko accused belgium of 
meddling in zaires internal affairs 
he suspended a 1989 accord under which belgium canceled 311 
million in debt and rescheduled another 399 million halved the 
four weekly flights from brussels to kinshasa by sabena belgiums 
national airline and closed three of belgiums four consulates in

countrys official news agency azap 
belgium denied it was interfering in zairean affairs foreign

the highly publicized suicide of a member of 
the unitarian church focused new attention on the denominations 
liberal social stands as leaders began their annual conference 
friday 
two years ago the church endorsed the right to die and leaders 
voiced support for janet adkins an alzheimers disease patient who 
used a suicide machine to end her life june 4 
the issue was expected to be a prime topic of discussion at the 
fiveday annual conference of the unitarianuniversalist 
association said the rev william schultz the churchs national 
president 
schultz who was scheduled to speak on the issue late friday 
declined to say if he expected attempts to reverse the churchs 
support for euthanasia he continues to support the principle and 
noted it is characteristic of the denomination which has endorsed 
homosexual marriages and marijuana legalization and prides itself 
on its openminded approach to social issues 
unitarianuniversalists have always affirmed that religion is 
not a sunday morning experience schultz said in an interview 
unitarianuniversalists believe religious principles need to be 
brought to bear on public policy questions and the political events 
of the day 
about 3000 delegates were expected to attend the conference of 
the bostonbased church which claims about 190000 members and 
1010 congregations nationally 
mrs adkins of portland ore ended her life june 4 in a van 
in a detroit suburb dr jack kevorkian hooked her up to a suicide 
device he built enabling the 54yearold woman to give herself a 
lethal dose of chemicals 
kevorkian hasnt been charged with a crime but a court issued 
an injunction barring further use of the machine 
unitarianuniversalists endorsed the right to die at their 1988 
meeting leaders voiced support for mrs adkins though a unitarian 
minister in michigan refused to let her use the machine inside a 
church 
euthanasia is far from the first difficult issue for schultz 
who has led the church since 1985 
we have always been outspoken that we as religious people have 
every right and even an obligation to speak out the truth as we see 
it to those who govern us and who are in positions of power he 
said 
at their general assembly in 1984 the church became the first 
majopr denomination to sanction marriages between homosexual 
couples 
in 1975 the unitarianuniversalists set up a national office 
for homosexual concerns in the early 1970s it sponsored sex 
education courses and passed a resolution calling for the 
legalization of marijuana it has long supported abortion rights 
and supported birth control as early as 1962 
schultz said unlike most mainstream christian bodies the church 
doesnt have a single doctrine instead it attempts to keep faith 
as open and tolerant as possible 
there is no theology that everyone is required to believe in 
but that doesnt mean there arent common principles we adhere 
to he said we believe the world the universe is too grand 
too complex too mysterious to be captured or capsulized in any one 
creed on any one religious tradition 
the first universalist church in north america was established 
in gloucester mass in 1779 in 1961 it merged with the 
unitarian church a 16th century church founded in romania

israeli foreign minister david levy offered 
friday to send humanitarian relief to iran to help search for 
trapped survivors of that countrys killer earthquake 
israel is very sorry for the grave natural disaster in iran 
and is prepared to give the iranians immediate aid as it has done 
for various other nations said eliza goren levys spokeswoman 
iran reportedly said humanitarian aid would be welcomed from all 
nations except south africa and israel 
goren said levy made the offer through the league of 
international red cross israel has had no diplomatic ties with 
iran since the islamic revolution ousted the shah in 1979 
dr mark heller a top researcher at the jaffe center for 
strategic studies said no one really expected the offer to be 
accepted 
i suspect that this is an attempt to demonstrate to the 
iranians that israel has no intrinsic hostility to iran heller 
said but i dont think that anyone seriously expects the iranian 
government will accept 
levys offer to iran comes as the new rightwing government has 
made various moves toward neighboring arab states 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has invited syrian president hafez 
assad to unconditioned talks and published his phone number 
requesting any arab states seeking peace to call 
but goren said levys offer to send a relief team to iran was 
made on humanitarian grounds only 
before khomeini rose to power iran was an island of support for 
the jewish state in the middle east and home to a wealthy jewish 
community of about 60000 it also provided 40 percent of israels 
oil needs 
israel sent relief teams after irans september 1978 earthquake 
israel has hoped that president ali khamenei would be more 
moderate than his predecessor 
israel has tried to cultivate better relations with iran for a 
long time but since the revolt the iranian regime has been 
extremely hostile to israel heller said the offer is 
consistent with israeli policy in the past the only change will be 
if iran actually accepts 
clandestine contacts between israel and iran however have 
continued they largely involved the sale of weapons and spare 
parts during irans eightyear war with iraq 
in december 1987 israel sent a 42member rescue team to search 
for survivors in soviet armenia

police arrested 140 aids activists friday 
after they blocked downtown traffic to protest claims that women 
are denied access to aids treatment and research 
the protest marked the fourth day of demonstrations by aids and 
gay rights activists many who traveled to san francisco for the 
sixth international aids conference 
fridays arrests brought the total to 299 nearly all the 
protests have taken place outside the conference the only incident 
inside the moscone center came friday morning when several 
demonstrators briefly interrupted a morning seminar there were no 
arrests 
the demonstration a few blocks from the conference included a 
march and several women speakers including those advocating the 
rights of prostitutes 
the crowd shouted slogans such as women die faster its a 
disaster and nih we think youre vile we need clinical 
trials 
the call refers to the national institutes of healths trials of 
experimental drug which rely heavily on male subjects 
ive been denied access to clinical trials and ive been 
denied medical care catherine ritter a new york woman with aids 
told the crowd as a number of women tied themselves to police 
barricades with red paper chains 
carol leigh a selfprofessed prostitute from san francisco 
complained that prostitutes are being wrongly persecuted as aids 
carriers 
dressed in a gay 90s music hall dress and a red feather boa 
leigh said prostitutes help stop the spread of disease by using 
condoms 
prostitutes are safesex educators she said 
protesters moved from their spot near the moscone center and 
marched through crowded lunchtime streets chanting and blowing 
whistles before finally halting for a diein at a busy 
intersection 
police issued what has become a standard warning to clear the 
street when a group of protesters elected to stay police circled 
them and began the long process of arresting them as noon time 
shoppers and other demonstrators looked on most were booked for 
failure to disperse and then released 
a half hour later a second group of demonstrators ran back into 
the street starting the process all over again 
many shoppers were trapped on the street until police finished 
the arrests most watched patiently but some expressed frustration 
with the week of demonstrations that have tied up the city 
i can understand their emotions but i question their 
tactics said lillian schneiderman a shopper from nearby east 
bay 
but not everyone was aware of the ongoing protests an elderly 
woman startled by the crowds asked what was going on when told 
it was an aids demonstration her face wrinkled in disgust 
its their own fault she said they shouldnt have ever 
taken that stuff

a constitutional accord aimed at keeping 
frenchspeaking quebec in the canadian federation died late friday 
and a government official blamed the premier of newfoundland 
the agreement which would have designated quebec a distinct 
society had to be ratified by all 10 provinces by midnight 
saturday all but newfoundland and manitoba had ratified the 
socalled meech lake accord 
newfoundlands premier clyde wells on friday night suspended 
debate indefinitely on the measure a move that effectively killed 
the accord said sen lowell murray prime minister brian 
mulroneys top constitutional adviser 
murray said mulroney would address this nation of 26 million 
residents on saturday 
quebecs premier robert bourassa told his provincial legislature 
friday that the meech lake accord has not been ratified 
in the name of all quebecois i want to express my profound 
disappointment he said 
the federal government had made a lastditch effort to save the 
accord through a supreme court extension of the deadline 
government lawyers believed that only quebecs ratification which 
took place june 23 1987 and started the process would expire 
saturday night 
but murray said an extension of the deadline would only have 
worked if preceded by a positive vote in newfoundland one of 
canadas poorest provinces with about 500000 residents 
earlier the manitoba legislature pushed the agreement close to 
death when it was forced to adjourn by the lone indian member of 
the assembly the lawmaker wanted constitutional recognition of 
indian tribes as distinct people 
manitoba did its best but was obstructed premier wells 
decision to break his committment and not hold his vote tonight 
killed the last hope for meach lake to succeed murray said 
in newfoundland wells said he felt meech lake is wrong for 
the longterm future of canada and wrong for the longterm future 
for this province 
the fivepoint agreement first approved by the prime minister 
and the premiers of the provinces in 1987 is aimed at winning 
quebecs signature on canadas 1982 constitution in that year the 
ministers set a threeyear deadline for approval by the parliament 
and legislatures 
but in the interim governments changed in three of the 
provinces manitoba newfoundland and new brunswick and the 
premiers reneged on the signatures of their predecessors 
in early june mulroney called the premiers to ottawa where 
they spent a week in intense private meetings they agreed to pass 
the original accord as it is new brunswick passed it last week 
the dithering over the accord has given rise to increased 
nationalist sentiment in quebec it has been implied that if the 
meech lake accord is not ratified quebec which contains 
onefourth of canadas population will have to rethink its role in 
the canadian federation 
english canada must clearly understand quebec is today and 
forever a distinct society bourassa told the legislature 
opposition parti quebecois leader jacques parizeau extended his 
hand to bourassa to work together to find a new path for quebec 
lets just accept the idea of being together and discussing 
the future among ourselves parizeau said 
manitobas delay was the work of legislator elijah harper who 
managed to put off a vote on the accord in winnipeg 
on friday the manitoba legislature legally was required to 
adjourn in the early afternoon unless it extended its session 
unanimously harper holding an eagle feather uttered no 
we will use every tactic to make sure that the aboriginal 
people are heard said harper a cree indian 
quebecs minister for intergovernmental affairs gil remillard 
said thursday that if meech lake was not ratified quebec would not 
make another effort to revive the process and would start looking 
for something else 
we will not start again remillard said weve had enough 
thats it 
there has been speculation quebec may again threaten to secede 
from canada

a government official on friday warned british 
newspapers that they could face legally binding controls if they 
fail to take steps to within one year to stop invasions of privacy 
home secretary david waddington writing in the times of london 
said it was the last chance for the newspapers to police 
themselves before the government intervenes 
we will not flinch from introducing statutory regulation of 
the press waddington said we all hope that it will not come 
to this but it is up to the industry proprietors editors and 
journalists to realize this hope for no one else can 
britains racy tabloids the prime target of the ultimatum 
conjured up a dire vision of their journalists being jailed for 
going on a favorite assignment dogging royalty if the 
government goes ahead with its threat 
the journalists union and editors organizations also protested 
that the move threatened press freedoms 
but amid the protests and fingerpointing there was also rueful 
acknowledgment that the fiercely competitive popular tabloids 
sometimes go too far 
in recent years incidents have included a reporter posing as a 
doctor to get medical records of a dying tv personality to see if 
the man had aids 
last january a reporter and photographer for a freewheeling 
weekly sunday sport barged into an intensive care ward to 
interview an actor suffering from brain damage 
in an announcement in parliament on thursday the government 
said it will establish a statefunded press tribunal headed by a 
judge or senior lawyer unless the press sets up within 12 months a 
new voluntary watchdog body 
if newspapers flout an 18point code of ethics to be 
administered by the voluntary body the newspaper complaints 
commission or it proves generally ineffective after six months 
the tougher press tribunal will be appointed 
the tribunal would have powers to stop publication of offending 
articles and force newspapers to pay compensation to people whose 
privacy has been violated the government said 
waddington said the government also plans to create three new 
criminal offenses that would outlaw physical intrusion bugging 
photographing or taperecording on private property to obtain 
personal material for publication 
private property would include hotel bedrooms and hospital wards 
the moves were recommended by a panel chaired by a cambridge 
university dean david calcutt which was appointed in april 1989 
after growing complaints about press invasions of privacy 
the opposition labor party in rare accord with the conservative 
government welcomed the ultimatum reflecting growing impatience 
with previous press promises to curb excesses 
we believe in another freedom the right of individuals to 
live in freedom and in peace said roy hattersley labors deputy 
leader 
unlike most other western european countries britain has no 
righttoprivacy laws or laws against physical intrusion 
the ultimatum culminated years of complaints about the sexy 
kissandtell tabloids purchased interviews and footinthedoor 
pursuits of pop stars royalty politicians criminals or 
littleknown people suddenly in the limelight 
the present watchdog body for britains 130 daily and sunday 
newspapers and 1800 other weekly papers is a press council that 
merely has powers to complain 
the association of british editors called waddingtons ultimatum 
another turn of the screw against the free workings of the 
press 
the 585000circulation tabloid today headlined its report 
jail editors to protect the royals others complained the 
regulations would hamper investigative journalism 
but several influential newspapers and press executives welcomed 
the move

the city commission dropped a planned welcome 
resolution for nelson mandela on friday and some cuban exiles 
called for demonstrations during his visit here to protest 
mandelas praise for fidel castro 
mandela is scheduled to address a labor convention in miami 
beach on june 28 as part of his us tour 
the political furor arose over mandelas comments thursday on 
abc in which he thanked castro as well as palestine liberation 
organization leader yasser arafat and libyan president moammar 
gadhafi for their longtime support of the onceoutlawed african 
national congress 
those remarks also prompted criticism friday from american 
jewish leaders 
the statement pained many many members of the miami 
community said mayor xavier suarez a cubanamerican 
there was an unwilligness to analyze other struggles for 
freedom suarez said it was sort of hes my ally and my ally 
can do no wrong 
a proclamation welcoming mandela and praising his struggle was 
dropped because such measures are traditionally approved by 
unanimous vote and two cubanamerican commission members victor 
deyurre and miriam alonso have now objected suarez said 
the mayor added that he also was troubled by the comments 
although he said he strongly supports mandelas campaign for a 
nonracial democracy 
the miami reaction was not only on an official level phone 
lines on cuban talks shows lit up friday with almost all callers 
condemning mandela 
we cubans should go protest one caller to radio mambi said 
out with mandela we have enough communists here 
tomas regalado the stations news director said cubans felt 
mandela was hypocritical 
this guy has a double standard on human rights regalado 
said he wants human rights for black people in south africa but 
hes denying human rights to the black people in cuba 
mandela said western leaders should not assume that their 
enemies are the same as the ancs enemies he said castro arafat 
and gadhafi had been staunch supporters of the anc at times when 
the west ignored the black south african cause 
in new york leaders of jewish organizations also criticized 
mandela 
we believe americans generally will be disappointed by his 
notion that the terrorism and human rights violations of the 
gadhafis arafats and castros of this world do not matter as long 
as they provide aid to the african national congress said robert 
k lifton and henry siegman president and executive director 
respectively of the american jewish congress 
albert vorspan senior vice president of the 840congregation 
union of american hebrew congregations stated 
nelson mandelas statements of support for the plo libya and 
cuba during his visit in new york are disappointing his 
problematic remarks have undone some of the good work accomplished 
at our meeting in geneva in clarifying issues of concern to the 
jewish community 
abraham h foxman another member of the jewish group that met 
with mandela in geneva two weeks ago said mandelas statements 
remain troubling and inconsistent 
americans will continue to support mandelas struggle against 
apartheid they are likely however to take issue with his remarks 
which reiterated his loyalty to sworn enemies of the united 
states and democracy said foxman director of the 
antidefamation league

the editor of gettysburg colleges 
literary magazine rejected a federal arts grant friday saying he 
believes restrictions placed on the money violate the right to 
freedom of expression 
peter stitt editor of the gettysburg review said new 
stipulations banning obscene or meritless art result in prior 
restraint 
the stipulations were added to the national endowment of the 
arts grants last year after a furor over federal funding of an 
exhibit by robert mapplethorpe some of the photos had homoxesexual 
themes the changes have brought widespread protests from artists 
and their supporters 
the gettysburg review publishes poetry fiction and nonfiction 
articles it has never published anything considered obscene stitt 
said 
my decision should not be construed as support for 
obscenity he said but i cannot see any way for us to 
determine what the endowment considers obscene unless we submit the 
materials that we wish to publish to the endowment for review prior 
to the publication 
submitting marterial for approval an action that could result 
in prior restraint contradicts the first amendment right to 
freedom of expression he said 
the nea does not have a procedure for checking up on the 
thousands of photographers dancers urban designers painters and 
other artists who receive federal grants each year 
the journal received a 4550 grant to increase its advertising 
budget stitt said the publication had asked for the grant before 
the new regulations were enacted last fall 
under the regulations grant recipients were asked to swear off 
art that included depictions of sadomasochism homoeroticism the 
sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts 
and which when taken as a whole do not have serious literary 
artistic political or scientific merit 
all of the more than 4000 grant recipients this year were asked 
to sign letters promising to comply with federal guidelines 
at least two artists have declined to accept nea grants because 
of the restrictions 
theater producer joseph papp refused a 50000 grant and dance 
choreographer bella lewitzky declined 72000 
the new school for social research which received a 45000 
grant to build a sculpture garden at its new york city campus 
filed a lawsuit in may saying the guidelines were 
unconstitutional the lawsuit has not been settled 
congress currently is considering an bush administration 
proposal to extend the nea program for five years without any 
restrictions 
the proposal scheduled to be considered on the house floor in 
midjuly could face amendments that would add restrictions or 
guidelines for grants house leaders have said

now that the red phone linking soviet 
and us leaders in case of military crisis is becoming obsolete 
the governments should establish green lines to battle 
ecological problems officials said friday 
scientists and government officials approved a series of 
recommendations to further communication and cooperation in 
conservation and wildlife management at the usussr 
conference on environmental conservation 
the weeklong conference of nearly 40 representatives from each 
country was held at washington and lee university 
edward laroe a research director for the fish and wildlife 
service said the conference was the most comprehensive since the 
usussr agreement on cooperation in environmental protection 
was signed in 1972 
delegation leaders said the increasing popularity of the 
environmental movement in both countries and the prospect of a 
peace dividend the shift from military to domestic spending 
could further environmental cooperation 
the resolutions friday included establishing green lines of 
rapid communication between governments during environmental crises 
like the exxon valdez oil spill in alaska and the nuclear accident 
in chernobyl 
us fish and wildlife service spokesman mike smith said his 
agency is anticipating its largest budget ever in 1991 
we believe we are going to have the level of funding necessary 
to begin some of these cooperative efforts smith said 
the idea for green lines came from the soviet delegation 
leader aleksei yablokov a zoologist and member of the natural 
resources committee in the congress of peoples deputies the lines 
would link key government leaders and experts in particular 
scientific fields 
if the countries can have a red phone for use in a potential 
military crisis why not a green phone between the two 
nations smith said 
other proposals were to 
study areas in both countries that have undergone ecological 
catastrophes 
establish common information banks with standardized methods 
for data collection and storage 
increase the number size and types of ecosystems represented 
in networks of protected areas 
carry out wildlife inventories and monitoring activities in 
both health and disturbed ecosystems

for singing sexually explicit songs 
fiftythree percent of the registered voters responding to the 
masondixon poll disagreed with a federal court ruling that the 
groups recored nasty as they wanna be is obscene the 
pollsters announced friday thirtyeight percent of the respondents 
agreed with the ruling 
in order to rule the record obscene the court had to find it 
violated community standards of decency 
the poll conducted for newspapers and broadcasters around the 
state was conducted last week among 627 randomly selected 
registered voters the margin of error was 4 percent 
the poll also found 54 percent of those surveyed said it was 
wrong for broward county sheriffs nick nararro to order the arrest 
of band members after a concert two weeks ago while 37 percent 
supported the arrests 
band leader luther campbell was buoyed by the poll results 
thats great he said nobody in the united states should 
be able to tell somebody else what they can listen to 
navarro refused to comment on the poll results 
the sheriffs really not interested in the poll said 
navarros spokesman al gordon hes interested in the law

a federal judge friday refused to block the 
execution of black widow killer judi buenoano whose lawyers 
had claimed that a malfunctioning state electric chair posed cruel 
and unusual punishment 
us district judge patricia fawsett said tests on the chair 
showed the equipment was in good working order 
she extended the temporary stay of execution until 9 am 
monday and it was rescheduled for 901 am said jon peck 
spokesman for gov bob martinez 
ms buenoanos chief defense lawyer billy h nolas said the 
decision would be appealed to the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals in atlanta 
ms buenoano 47 known as the black widow killer because of 
convictions for the fatal poisoning of her husband the drowning of 
her son and the attempted murder of her boyfriend had been granted 
a temporary stay of execution thursday 
the judge said a polyurethene sponge since removed from the 
electric chair was what caused sparks smoke and fire to leap from 
the head of executed killer jesse tafero last month 
but she said that and other equipment problems had been 
corrected by the state 
nolas contended the defenses claim that the electric chair may 
malfunction has not been resolved 
we are still concerned that our client may literally be burned 
at the stake he said 
prison officials called in an independent electrician to inspect 
the chair for damage and he testified late friday that he found no 
problems with the equipment 
if there had been a crack or a fault there is no way i would 
have gotten that good reading from his testing meter said the 
electrician thomas brandies of jacksonville 
the state contends that tafero received such a powerful bolt of 
electricity during his execution that he did not suffer despite 
the flames and sparks 
the florida supreme court on wednesday rejected an appeal from 
buenoano on the same basis 
ms buenoanos lawyers also crossexamined her trial lawyer 
james johnston to prove he was ineffective counsel in the 1985 
firstdegree murder trial here he was quizzed closely about why he 
did not introduce possible mitigating circumstances to convince the 
jury to sentence his client to life in prison instead of the 
electric chair 
ms buenoano was sentenced to death for the fatal arsenic 
poisoning of her husband air force sgt james e goodyear in 
orlando in 1971 
she also was convicted of killing her paralyzed son michael 
goodyear 19 by pushing him from a canoe in a 1980 outing and of 
attempted murder in a car bombing that injured her boyfriend john 
gentry in 1983 
she would be the second woman executed in the united states 
since the us supreme court lifted its ban on capital punishment 
in 1976 north carolina killed velma barfield by lethal injection 
in 1984 for poisoning her boyfriend

the fbi summarily dismissed an fbi agent who 
had sued the agency for attempting to fire him because of his 
homosexuality the mans lawyer said 
two fbi officials came to agent frank buttinos home wednesday 
morning and read a brief termination order from fbi headquarters 
said buttinos lawyer richard gayer 
he was shocked very upset gayer said thursday from san 
francisco he didnt think they would be gross enough to fire him 
before the hearing 
fbi spokesman gene reihl in san diego declined comment and 
referred calls to spokesman charles steinmetz in washington dc 
who was unavailable friday 
the fbi placed buttino on administrative leave in september 
after a 20year career his security clearance was revoked may 29 
without explanation 
on june 8 buttino filed a suit in us district court in san 
francisco seeking to stop the government from firing him 
the 45yearold buttino has handled counterespionage terrorism 
investigations and other sensitive cases gayer said 
gayer said the firing order makes the fbi look cruel and 
callous its obvious from their approach that they intend to 
fight tooth and nail on this now we have something really tangible 
to fight 
according to the bureaus hiring policy the agency does not 
discriminate based on sexual preference 
they gave no explanation why the agents security clearance 
was revoked or why he was fired gayer said just that 
suddenly they dont trust him any more 
buttinos lawsuit alleges that the fbi regularly discriminates 
against gays gayer said 
after the fbi learned in 1988 that buttino was homosexual he 
provided details of his personal life to eliminate any concern he 
could be blackmailed gayer said 
the agents san diego supervisors and colleagues with whom he 
has worked for 17 years continue to trust and respect him gayer 
said 
what washington is saying is we dont trust you because 
youre gay gayer said its significant that everyone he 
worked with supports him but there are two or three people in 
washington who have never met him or spoken to him and they are 
the ones with the power to revoke his security clearance 
buttino was five years away from qualifying for a full 
government pension he must regain his job within a year or he will 
lose that pension gayer said

cascade mountains this week by biologists who howled to attract the 
elusive endangered predators 
the den was the second found this year in washington the state

wolf dens in washington after their eradication decades ago is 
truly a happy event for everybody

and wildlife service since 1967 in every state but minnesota and 
alaska 
sightings of adult gray wolves have been reported off and on for 
years in washington state the most recent 15 years ago but 
breeding wolves have been unknown in washington since the turn of 
the century making the recent discoveries remarkable said state 
endangered species specialist harriet allen 
state and federal biologists discovered the second den monday 
during a howling survey in which biologists emulate wolf calls 
and hope for an answer 
isenson said the biologists saw two wolf pups cross in front of 
their headlights shortly after the officials had howled 
on may 23 biologists confirmed the existence of a wolf den in 
the hozomeen area of the ross lake national recreation area 
roughly 40 miles northwest of the second discovery

a house committee on thursday voted to cut off 
military aid for zaire to protest human rights abuses president 
mobutu sese sekos alleged corruption and his failure to carry out 
promised political reforms 
the decision by the house appropriations committee is expected 
to be upheld by the full house when the foreign aid bill reaches 
the floor next week 
the committee does not believe that us interests in zaire 
should override our concerns with respect to corruption and human 
rights abuses the bill said 
the committee seriously questions the administrations 
insistence on providing us taxpayers dollars to a government 
whose head of state has reportedly amassed a personal fortune of as 
much as 6 million while zaire remains a very poor country it 
said 
us military aid to zaire this year was 4 million in 
addition the united states provided almost 50 million in food and 
development assistance 
a group of lawmakers is preparing a letter to secretary of state 
james a baker iii asking that all us development aid be 
channeled through private voluntary organizations rather than 
through the government of zaire 
the letter also criticizes the backward steps taken by 
mobutu since he pledged last april to lift a ban on opposition 
parties and allow free elections said a source familiar with the 
letter 
some members of congress have accused the bush administration of 
ignoring mobutus human rights abuses because of his support for 
us policy in africa in recent years mobutu has played an 
important role by serving as a conduit for us arms to the rebels 
fighting the sovietbacked government of angola 
the administration on thursday praised a report by an inquiry 
commission in zaire for bringing to light important facts about a 
may 11 military raid against university students at lubumubashi 
university 
the panel said it could not determine how many students were 
killed when masked soldiers launched the raid in revenge for the 
beating of three students who were government informers differing 
reports put the death toll between 50 and 150 
the panel said the governor of shaba province authorized the 
attack but he remains free and no one has been charged in the 
attack 
the united states has not condemned the incident initially 
saying it could not confirm reports of a massacre and subsequently 
saying its embassy had found out that one or two students were 
killed 
belgium decided to freeze all cooperation with its former colony 
once it learned of the killings last month the belgian government 
welcomed the commissions report but said it would not resume 
cooperation with zaire pending government action on the findings of 
the report

a compromise over limiting liability in oil 
spills may help move a bill on that issue that has been beached in 
congress house members said on thursday 
a compromise offered by rep gerry studds dmass would allow 
a fiveyear trial period to see if international standards of 
liability are adequate or can be changed 
i think its a sound approach it goes more than halfway 
said rep jack fields rtexas 
the house has approved letting international standards guide how 
much responsibility an oil or shipping company must take for a 
spill the senate version of the bill lets states set those 
standards nineteen states have laws requiring companies to assume 
unlimited liability for damage from a spill 
this compromise will allow us to enact the complete oil spill 
legislation said rep don young ralaska 
the congressmen during a hearing by the coast guard and 
navigation subcommittee of the house merchant marine and fisheries 
committee on response to recent oil spills urged the senate to 
agree to studds resolution of liability limits the main issue 
tying up the bills passage 
studds proposed a trial period of up to five years for the less 
stringent international protocols during that time the united 
states would push to strengthen international liability limits if 
they couldnt be strengthened the united states would return to 
its own standards

a bomb exploded on a military base northwest of 
london thursday but a security guard had spotted a suspicious 
rucksack and the base and a nearby senior citizens home were 
evacuated shortly before the blast 
no injuries were reported from the blast at the royal air 
forces 250acre administrative base stanmore park police said 
on wednesday night postal workers intercepted letter bombs 
addressed to the government minister in charge of welsh affairs and 
to a conservative parliamentarian who represents a welsh 
contituency 
the incidents at the base and in london appeared to be unrelated 
no one claimed responsibility for the explosion at the military 
base but suspicion fell on the irish republican army 
we cant say who was responsible at this stage but it looks 
as if the ira are the main suspects said detective chief 
superintendent derek willison secondincommand of scotland yards 
antiterrorist squad 
two men driving in the area after the explosion were picked up 
and questioned about the blast a scotland yard spokesman said 
they were later released without charge 
ministry of defense officials were investigating the attack 
while police forensic teams and antiterrorist officers searched 
the base scotland yards antiterrorist squad was called in to 
look for possible links with other recent attacks on military 
personnel 
there have been at least eight attacks on military personnel or 
facilities in britain since february they are blamed on the ira 
which is seeking to end british rule in northern ireland 
a civilian security guard on routine patrol found a suspicious 
looking blue rucksack between a perimeter fence and an 
administrative building shortly after 9 am police said he then 
called an inspector from the harrow police 
the base which contains living quarters for 40 air force 
officers and their families and a nearby home for about 30 elderly 
people were evacuated police said 
an explosives expert was called but the bomb exploded around 
940 am before he arrived on the scene 
a police spokesman credited the quick evacuation with saving 
lives 
they would have all been within the area of the bomb if they 
had not been evacuated he said of the elderly people 
wing commander simon appleton said there had been an apparent 
breach of perimeter security at the base 
willison said there was an outside chance that the bombers threw 
the explosive device over the 6foot wooden perimeter fence topped 
by barbed wire that surrounds the base 
in the other bomb incident investigators were looking into the 
possibility the two letter bombs had been sent by welsh extremists 
police said thursday no group claimed responsibility for the 
incendiary devices a welsh police spokesman said 
the letter bomb addressed to welsh secretary david hunt was 
intercepted wednesday night by workers in the westminster palace 
mail room 
a second letter bomb sent to nicholas bennett a conservative 
member of parliament also was intercepted by workers in the mail 
room at the house of commons on wednesday night 
bennett accused the welsh organization sons of glendower of 
sending it he said he had been targeted because he represented a 
welsh constituency 
police were investigating two other letter bombs sent wednesday 
one of which slightly injured an office worker at a welsh boat yard 
the other sent to a restaurant in dolgellau wales failed to 
go off and was handed over to police 
welsh nationalist extremists have waged a 10year arson campaign 
aimed primarily at englishowned businesses and properties

want to extend the ban to bushs cabinet and hundreds of other

whats good for the goose is good for the gander sen david 
pryor dark said in introducing the new bill thursday earlier 
the senate failed by two votes to override bush veto of the 
legislation to broaden federal workers political rights 
pryors new bill would extend the 1939 hatch acts ban on 
federal workers political activities to the more than 350 
employees on the white house payroll and another 600 presidential 
appointees 
in vetoing the earlier bill friday bush said that allowing 
federal workers to participate in campaigns would inevitably lead 
to repoliticizing the federal work force and destroy its 
essential political neutrality

and migration from the countryside that is about oneseventh of 
the national population 55 million 
tehran and other overpopulated cities have expanded so much 
that a remedy has to be found the daily newspaper abrar 
declared the problems are so complex that it seems even the most 
skilled planners are at a loss to find a workable program 
beyond the 8 million officially counted tehran has a floating 
population estimated at 2 million most of them in shantytowns on 
its southern edge those squalid slums were the bedrock of support 
for ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died a year ago 
in the parkstudded northern suburbs on the lower slopes of the 
alborz mountains overlooking the city wealthy iranians still live 
comfortably in their mansions and earn millions from real estate

no piped sewerage system drug abuse is rife despite a nationwide 
crackdown 
drinking water is becoming scarce and authorities speak of 
rationing the official islamic republic news agency said tehran is 
the most polluted city in the world 
tehrans 15 million motor vehicles clog the streets in a 
single vast traffic jam and the city is covered by choking smog 
it may take an hour to travel five miles in central tehran 
these days newspapers call tehran traffic the national enemy 
instead of iraq with which iran was at war for eight years until 
august 1988 
resalat another daily said in may that city buses are stuck in 
traffic jams for so long they burn 22 gallons of gas on a 30mile 
route it estimated tehran residents spent 12 billion hours a year 
in traffic jams

because of the polluted air and warns mothers not to take young 
children out 
officials acknowledge planning has become a nightmare a subway 
project is stalled although president hashemi rafsanjani ordered 
it speeded up 
the first 7mile section linking mohseni square to imam 
khomeini square was supposed to open in december it didnt

just talking about it a global survey published in may said 
tehran was the worlds most expensive city in dollar terms 
the study by corporate resources group of geneva based its

three women convicted of crimes against the 
state are put in an underground prison 
theyre stripsearched daily isolated from other inmates and 
kept under 24hour surveillance by guards and video cameras even 
in the shower everything they do including their conversations 
is logged by their jailers 
this isnt the gulag but a federal prison and it isnt 
fiction but a documentary film through the wire airing 
tuesday night to open the third season of pov the 
independent filmmakers series on pbs 
through the wire is typical of the kinds of risktaking 
unconventional documentaries offered in the 12week run of 
pov the cinematic abbreviation for point of view 
the film examines the high security unit of the federal prison 
at lexington ky which was condemned as a sensory deprivation 
tank for us political prisoners almost from the day it opened in 
1986 
the womens cells get virtually no natural light or ventilation 
their visiting rights correspondence and reading matter are 
severely limited they are barred from training rehabilitation or 
recreation programs 
psychologists call the technique small group isolation it 
makes prisoners easier to manage it is scary to think about it 
being used against people convicted of politically motivated crimes 
next weeks pov is just as unconventional 
metamorphosis man into woman follows two years in the life of 
gary a man who suffers from gender dysphoria the conviction 
that he is a woman trapped in a mans body 
metamorphosis follows gary as he undergoes preliminary 
plastic surgery therapy and other subtler processes he must go 
through to live as a woman and qualify for sex reassignment 
surgery 
its a subdued and sympathetic portrait of a person braving a 
profound transformation its engrossing to watch gary and his 
friends and coworkers cope with his struggle to become gaby 
in through the wire us bureau of prisons officials 
contend the highsecurity unit is not to punish or brainwash the 
women but because they may be subject to rescue attempts by 
outside groups 
the women are 
susan rosenberg indicted in the 1983 bombing of the us 
capitol serving 58 years for possession of weapons and explosives 
with recommendation against parole 
alejandrina torres of the faln puerto rican independence 
movement serving 35 years for seditious conspiracy to bomb a us 
military installation with recommendation against parole 
sylvia baraldini serving 43 years for conspiracy and 
racketeering in aiding and abetting the bloody 1981 brinks armored 
car robbery in nyack ny 
through the wire produced directed and cowritten by nina 
rosenblum has weaknesses including the assertion that the womens 
crimes were nonviolent when in fact they conspired in or 
furthered very violent acts indeed 
theres also a jarringly unnecessary simulation of male 
guards at surveillance monitors watching one woman pacing back and 
forth and another women showering with her back to the camera we 
got the idea without it 
and there are montages of home movies and still photos showing 
the women in their childhoods and preradical days it suggests the 
obvious that even cute welladjusted kids from nice families can 
become dedicated revolutionaries 
and the film finds no irony in its portrayal of revolutionaries 
who attack a government they view as fundamentally evil break its 
laws and then complain that the state isnt playing by the rules 
in the way it punishes them 
even so it becomes obvious in the course of the film that these 
women are suffering in a punishing oppressive environment 
rosenberg especially seems to decline physically and emotionally 
none of them flourishes 
eventually the women sue the bureau of prisons in july 1988 
us district judge barrington parker orders that rosenberg and 
baraldini be moved in with other inmates he forbids the 
consideration of past political associations or personal 
political beliefs in deciding inmate transfers 
he does not find that the units conditions unconstitutionally 
cruel but says the prisoners treatment skirted elemental 
standards of human decency 
through the wire concludes with a few ominous notes 
parkers ruling subsequently was overruled by an appeals court 
the lexington unit was closed but the bureau of prisons opened 
a new highsecurity prison in marianna fla in september 1988 
and there are 16 prisons with similar highsecurity units 
currently under construction or in planning in the united states

from the kitchen table of her tidy comfortable home on route 
10 geiger runs the elvis postage stamp campaign her goal is 
to convince the us postal service to give the king its stamp 
of approval 
without question elvis presley is the perfect subject for a 
us commemorative postage stamp geiger said he was and even 
though he left us 13 years ago continues to be one of this 
countrys greatest goodwill ambassadors 
her devotion may pay off a postal service official says elvis 
is indeed still alive in a postal sense 
theres a very good chance that sometime in the future there 
will be an elvis stamp said frank thomas a postal service 
marketing specialist in washington dc personally i think 
there will be 
the major obstacle for a presley postage stamp is concern over 
the lifestyle issue thomas said the postal service has received 
mail complaining that honoring a known drug abuser sends a bad 
message to americas youth he said 
but geiger scoffs at that notion pointing to other stamp 
subjects with controversial private lives presley stamps already 
have been issued in at least seven countries including west 
germany she said 
since beginning her campaign in 1983 geiger said she has gone 
through five postmasters general and is now on her sixth anthony 
frank 
frank reportedly said soon after taking office that he supports 
an elvis stamp but after the ensuing outcry over presleys 
welldocumented drug abuse the king died of an overdose in 1977 
frank retreated and said the issue requires further review 
his wavering prompted geiger to publicly call him a wimp 
it also renewed her determination to honor the man she credits 
with changing her life 
i will not give up until either elvis gets his stamp or i die 
whichever comes first the 70yearold greatgrandmother said 
over a lunchtime beer 
to understand the extent of geigers passion for presley one 
must visit her house it is walltowall and floortoceiling 
elvis posters line every wall most highlighting presleys 1970s 
jumpsuit phase 
bookcases are stuffed with presley tomes both reverential and 
scandalous shelves burst with videocassettes of presley movies 
and photo albums hold thousands of pictures thats not including 
her records and tapes 
the first presley picture geiger bought a blackandwhite shot 
taken at a 1968 press conference will be buried with her she vows 
pictures are my addiction geiger said then adds pardon 
me evis for using that word 
presleymania came late in geigers life although her older son 
dressed in pink and black in the 1950s to emulate presley geiger 
did not convert until a 1968 tv show known as the comeback 
special 
i looked at that man in that black leather suit and said 
phew geiger said i sat in that chair and said nobody is 
that good looking it was kind of sudden i was never the same 
after that night 
the postage stamp entered her life in 1983 when a fellow 
presley fan mentioned the idea after some investigating geiger 
learned ordinary citizens are not eligible for stamp consideration 
until 10 years after their deaths 
so geiger spent the next several years laying the groundwork for 
her big 1987 push 
i thought it would be a simple thing she said boy was i 
naive 
postal service officials have come to know geiger well thomas 
said she is in fact one of their best customers firing off 
letters to anybody connected with the agency 
you name em ive written to em she said waving a wrist 
adorned with an elvis presley watch 
commemorative postage stamps are nominated by the 15member 
citizens stamp advisory committee which meets every two months 
and then must be approved by the postmaster general thomas said 
although presley has been eligible for three years he still has 
not been chosen for the honor does this mean elvis the stamp 
is dead 
no not at all thomas said 
the committee might include presley in a stamp series on 
american musicians but that doesnt sit well with geiger 
elvis was one of a kind there will never be another she 
said he does not fit into a group 
the committee will announce next years commemorative stamps 
within a month thomas said 
if they dont announce it that doesnt mean it wont show up 
in 1991 he said the fact that theyre spending so much time 
on the subject is a positive sign 
meanwhile geiger waits impatiently and spends her days mostly 
on presleyrelated matters there are the constant letters from 
supporters around the world the radio appearances the newspaper 
interviews 
how did i get here i absolutely do not know she said 
next to my children hes the most important person in my life i 
dont know what id do if there wasnt an elvis

using a farm machine like a giant 
mixing spoon don wilkinson whips up a batch of sewage sludge 
sawdust and papermill waste carefully protecting his recipe for 
garden feed and fill 
its hard to get the formula so we dont let it out 
wilkinson said after climbing down a monstrous device that has 
just chewed up a 100yardlong pile of the reeking black 
concoction 
wilkinson is chief operator at the hawk ridge compost facility 
which turns organic waste into products sold to contractors and 
nurseries 
its also hoping to turn a profit before long after only six 
months the facility already is paying its costs and looking 
forward to making money on its landscaping and garden supplements 
which are made with industrial and municipal sludges long dismissed 
as useless 
all were doing is speeding up natures own work said jamie 
ecker acting manager of hawk ridge 
but the facility is a pioneer in what is widely seen as an 
industry of the future not only does it recycle materials that 
would otherwise be dumped in landfills but it provides evidence 
that caring for the environment doesnt always have to cost money 
the market for these kinds of recycled materials will take off 
and enhance our ability to make money on the venture said 
william ginn president of the yarmouthbased resource conservation 
services inc which owns hawk ridge and is involved in a variety 
of recycling enterprises 
we think composting is going to be one of the major 
solidwaste solutions ginn said 
each week hawk ridge accepts 25 dumptruck loads of dried sewage 
sludge from nearly a dozen communities along with six tractor 
trailers of sawdust and 10 dumptruck loads of papermill waste 
hawk ridge is paid to take the sludge and mill waste but it 
buys the sawdust which is becoming increasingly scarce as more 
paper mills burn it for energy 
wilkinson and his assistant doug knowlton make a new batch of 
compost by taking a base of the old stuff adding papermill 
sludge a layer of sawdust as a bulking agent and sewage sludge 
once the mixture reaches the crucial 131degree temperature 
its turned by steel teeth protruding from huge rollers on a 
customdesigned machine which is driven over the piles every day 
for 15 days 
the heat resulting from biochemical reactions kills 
diseasecausing bacteria in the compost heaps 
while the process seems as simple as spreading manure ecker 
said it took time to develop a mixing and curing formula that 
results in a safe odorless and commercially viable product using 
readily available wastes 
the process is even tracked by computer to make sure each batch 
of compost is made according to recipe said wilkinson 
nora goldstein executive editor of biocycle magazine a journal 
of waste recycling said she knows of no other facility that 
accepts such a wide assortment of wastes for composting 
she also said it is one of few that is privately owned a number 
of municipalities have their own sludge facilities and yardwaste 
sites 
since it opened in march hawk ridge has turned out 6000 cubic 
yards of composted material ecker said its commercial mix is used 
for such projects as landfill closings and highway and industrial 
park landscaping 
a homeowners mix as ecker calls it is made without 
papermill sludge which may contain tiny amounts of dioxin that 
ensures it is completely safe for gardens 
ecker said the company is still in the startup phase were 
not expecting to burn up the mortgage right away he said 
after all no one has done this before on this kind of scale 
but the possibilities appear endless hawk ridge will be 
processing food and paper wastes from fast food restaurants in new 
hampshire in july to see if composting is cheaper for them than 
other means of disposal ecker said 
the facility is composting food wastes from a maine processor 
and may run trials of old supermarket produce 
and an experiment mixing paper plates with sewage sludge was a 
huge success said wilkinson it degraded nice

not far from satans alley and a deadend street 
called god 48 families live in a public square they are victims 
of a war on squatters waged by a city of plenty with little room 
for its poor 
since march 15 when a winter moratorium on evictions ended 
riot police arriving before dawn have cleared dozens of buildings 
the evictions inspire denunciations demonstrations and charges 
that the city of paris where housing prices are soaring is trying 
to push the poor out of town 
were miserable here because we have nothing said assa kan 
a 30yearold woman from mali with six children they are among 150 
people who have lived under tents since may 2 in the place de la 
reunion 
at night its really cold she said caressing the chapped 
cheeks of her 4monthold daughter all the children are sick 
hers is the largest of three camps set up by squatters or 
renters turned out of condemned buildings nine families camp at 
the foot of sacre coeur the montmartre basilica and six live 
outside a city government office 
in announcing the spring offensive paris officials said 
squatting had reached inadmissible proportions 
the city is dutybound to solve this problem and evictions 
are the only way to stop the multiplication of squatters said 
jean tiberi deputy to mayor jacques chirac 
within days 300 people were homeless nearly half of them 
children 
these people had a right to squat said abbe pierre a 
bearded roman catholic cleric who is frances premier champion of 
the needy when a man is hungry he has the right to take bread 
from the baker 
abbe pierres humanitarian organization the emmaus community 
provided tents for those evicted 
a siege mentality prevails in the place de la reunion which is 
ringed with rosebushes and dotted with orange and blue tents 
amenities consist of one water spigot three portable toilets 
like those used at construction sites and intermittent lighting at 
night via an extension cord from a nearby cafe one tent serves as 
a kitchen 
mrs kan and others said they would remain until the city 
provided a suitable alternative 
we are confronted with the unacceptable bertrand main 
deputy chief of the league of human rights told reporters 
demands for rehousing are met with a wall of silence 
incomprehension and sometimes contempt 
paris proposed temporary housing for the evicted in buildings 
scheduled for demolition in st denis a poor northern suburb 
officials there objected 
we dont have a money problem in paris we have a problem of 
land tiberi the deputy mayor said in explaining the housing 
shortage on french radio 
for moral reasons we cannot accept the principle of 
rehousing squatters who rob legal occupants of apartment space 
he said 
at a news conference abbe pierre said it is a crime to 
refuse lodging in a city like paris where several thousand 
apartments are vacant 
the committee against poor housing a protest group that finds 
vacant buildings for squatters claims there are 3000 to 4000 
vacant governmentsubsidized moderate rent housing units around 
paris the city denies it 
officials say the number of buildings occupied by squatters 
most of them africans has grown from 36 to 187 in three years and 
41 of the buildins are subsidized units which have a waiting list 
of 50000 
mayor chirac said in a letter to abbe pierre made public june 
20 that rehousing evicted squatters would be a profound 
injustice to people on the waiting list paris is a city with 
heart he said but neither the capital nor the paris 
region can take in all the misery of the world 
critics claim the city is being transformed into a ghetto for 
the elite 
president francois mitterrand denounced those who enrich 
themselves while sleeping because they own a good piece of land 
or a nice apartment 
prices have risen so quickly he said that they are starting 
to exclude the possibility of suitable lodging for senior 
executives with salaries that can reach 50000 francs per month 
about 8700 
frederica koch and amina amara are among those keeping a vigil 
with the homeless at the place de la reunion 
ms koch was evicted last year from the rentcontrolled 
apartment she occupied for 25 years and at 58 is a squatter she 
lost her job as a clothes cutter during a 10year battle to keep 
her home 
ms amara a single woman with five children has been on a 
waiting list for a lowrent apartment for 15 years after eviction 
from one building she and her two youngest children spent a year 
in a shabby hotel and two months in a restaurant basement before 
squatting anew in december 
this problem is too big for us said berhima tembely an 
immigrant from senegal who paid a sympathy visit to the square 
the rich people are treating us like dogs you have to fight to 
live in this world

the ghost of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
stalks the islamic republic a year after his death in the form of 
a power struggle among the imams disciples that remains unresolved 
the revolution khomeini began 11 years ago surviveshowever 
frustrating the doomsayers who predicted it would fall apart when 
he was no longer there to unite the factions 
moves by president hashemi rafsanjani and his pragmatists 
toward a more liberal course have been stymied by antiwestern 
radicals who accuse him of straying from imam 
as khomeini was known 
both groups claim to be khomeinis true ideological heirs and 
invoke his commandments to justify their actions 
an iranian official speaking anonymously said rafsanjani 
sought tthe path of theo legitimize his more liberal policies through 
subtle 
interpretations of khomeinis teachings 
in response the 270member parliament passed a law in may that 
makes changing khomeinis writings a crime the parliament is 
dominated by radical followers of ali akbar mohtashemi a former 
interior minister 
the radicals include ahmad khomeini 44 the ayatollahs only 
surviving son he has made no apparent effort to claim his fathers 
mantle and is overshadowed by rotest demanding the government not involve 
itself in the hostage 
issue 
diplomats in tehran say rafsanjani appears determined to show 
the west he is moving the country away from isolation 
in an effort to create a more liberal social and political 
climate he has eased restrictions khomeini placed on irans 55 
million people he cannot move quickly because of radical 
opposition and faces growing discontent from a populace whose 
expectations were raised when he gained power 
there have been demonstrations against shortages unemployment 
estimated at 4 million and high inflation opposition groups say 
the revolutionary guards killed several protesters and arrested 
scores 
some progress has been made diplomats estimate inflation was 
trimmed from 30 percent to 20 percent in the past year and the 
government has contracts for major investment projects estimated to 
be worth billions of dollars 
rafsanjanis plans depend on oil revenue it is expected to be 
about 15 billion this year but nothing is certain in the volatile 
oil market 
the authorities know they have at best one or two years grace 
before economic problems produce dangerous political 
dissatisfaction vahe petrossian an iranian analyst based in 
london wrote last month in the middle east economic digest 
a waiter named khosrow in a tehran restaurant said all i want 
are three square meals a day for myself and my family someone has 
to rule but i dont really care who it is so long as i have enough 
to provide a roof for my family 
during the war i never complained but enough is enough 
mehrdad a taxi driver said i think most of the people are 
behind rafsanjani and they know hes trying to do something good 
for us 
asked if restoring relations with the united states did not go 
against khomeinis teachings he replied 
the imam said we must strike a blow against the united states 
how are we hurting the united states when we pay triple the price 
for american goods because we buy them through middlemen 
we would strike a more effective blow if we resumed ties and 
rebuilt our economy and industry so we become truly independent and 
powerful

warren beatty once among the most secretive 
of film stars is suddenly popping up all over the place arsenio 
oprah letterman good morning america and today 
why because he has some goods to sell namely dick tracy 
his stylish movie rendition of the old comic strip but beatty did 
virtually nothing to promote his last three films ishtar 
reds and heaven can wait 
he recently explained the change of heart 
for 12 or 13 years i didnt do much in the way of interviews 
that makes room for anybody to make up anything they want and some 
of the results can be disturbing i decided there was no way to 
cope with that unless you talk to people he said 
he has done more talking to the media in the past 10 days than 
at any time in his 30year film career at the dick tracy 
premiere last week at walt disney world in orlando fla he 
conducted a news conference before a mass of reporters before 
leaving for a round of satellite interviews in new york beatty 
talked by telephone about the aftermath of the movies opening 
about the first weekends gross 21 million from 2200 
screens ive never had that kind of opening the numbers are 
great i really never expected anything like it after all dick 
tracy didnt have a following from a comic book or a tv series 
like batman 
about the reviews theyre amazing virtually unanimous the 
only bad one we got was one of the first by some guy whose name i 
dont know it was joseph mcbride of daily variety who called 
the film a major disappointment executives from the walt 
disney co were so proud of the critical raves that they ran 
doublepage newspaper ads reprinting them in toto 
beatty first became interested in dick tracy many years ago 
but the project passed through other hands until he finally 
resolved to make it with disney why did he wait so long 
it is such a detailed picture that it wasnt something you 
could just go out and shoot i was involved in other things 
including a howard hughes story ive been wanting to do then i 
began getting ideas about how to do dick tracy i think you get 
around to making a picture when you can no longer put it off 
most critics have praised the look of dick tracy the use 
of the same basic colors without different shades beatty said the 
concept originated in a conversation with playwright herb gardner 
im not rappaport 
he used to do a comic strip and he told me how the printer 
had numbers for the colors on the rotogravure which was the paper 
they used in those days for instance red might be number 2 and 
he would give the number to a hat a car a flower and so forth i 
was captivated by that idea 
many reviewers commended the outlandish characters of al pacino 
and dustin hoffman as well as the sexcharged madonna beatty does 
not appear to feel slighted that his own performance was sometimes 
overlooked what appealed to me was that the material allowed for 
some outrageous performances all the people were so interesting 
that it was good for the picture 
in the comic strip dick tracy was always the solid guy in the 
middle of all these weird characters he was very very straight 
and thats how i played him 
the initial prosperity of dick tracy has led to talk of a 
sequel beatty commented cautiously ive never done a sequel 
but i wouldnt totally rule it out then again there are so many 
other things to do and movies arent the only thing in my life

since politicians in both parties aided and 
abetted the savings and loan scandal it takes some rewriting of 
history to make the mess into a 1990 congressional campaign issue 
for either republicans or democrats 
both sides are trying in a dispute that has them shouting about 
blame but saying little about solutions to the problems behind the 
biggest bailout in american history 
after his spokesman waded into the sampl dispute president bush 
endorsed the counterattack but claimed the high road i think 
more important than continuing to pour fuel on that spark is 
continuing to work with the congress in trying to get that mess 
solved he said wednesday 
the white house already had provided a text for republican 
revisionists by claiming that in the dead of night a decade ago 
democrats pushed through legislation to sharply increase the 
ceiling on deposit insurance and ease restrictions on savings and 
loan lending practices 
in fact republicans collaborated on the measure which had a 
gop coauthor and overwhelming support in both parties it passed 
the house 380 to 13 with only five republicans voting no the 
senate approved it without a roll call vote 
when president jimmy carter signed it on march 31 1980 he 
called it a bipartisan landmark reform an important move toward 
deregulation and a boon to small savers 
democrats prefer to start the crisis clock running a bit later 
after ronald reagan took office putting the blame on his 
administration and his vice president george bush for lax 
regulation of savings and loans 
when reagan signed a bill in 1982 permitting sampls to make 
commercial loans and increase consumer lending leeway that 
licensed riskier ventures with federally insured deposits he said 
it was a longterm solution to industry problems 
all in all i think we hit the jackpot he said 
some jackpot 
that bill it should be noted had democratic sponsorship and 
support 
nor do democrats talk much about the way house democratic 
leaders stalled and sliced measures to start dealing with industry 
problems sooner at costs that now look like a bargain resigned 
house speaker jim wright had a hand in that his involvement with 
savings and loan interests and his intervention with regulators 
were factors in his downfall 
four of the five senators involved in the most celebrated of the 
savings and loan cases are democrats the senate ethics committee 
is investigating their intercession with federal regulators on 
behalf of charles h keating jr and his now bankrupt lincoln 
savings and loan association after he gave them campaign 
contributions 
so some democrats have taken to arguing that the savings and 
loan crisis should be viewed in two installments before bush and 
after bush they argue that the bush administration has mishandled 
the bailout miscalculated the cost and done too little to 
prosecute sampl wrongdoers and reclaim their take bush says his goal 
is to protect depositors and bring the guilty to justice and that 
hes doing both 
but almost across the board both parties have their problems 
theres plenty of blame to go around said sen robert dole 
of kansas the republican leader in the final analysis it lies 
everywhere 
thats because of the attributes that have made savings and loan 
interests so powerful politically and in lobbying for their aims 
theres a branch in almost every town a bloc in every 
congressional district all with money to spend on campaign 
contributions 
that has led members of both parties to say write and do things 
they may now regret the standard explanation is that the letter 
or phone call or visit was in behalf of a constituent 
theres enough a lot of responsibility for every place but 
i see some disturbing signs of democrats wanting to make this 
political to republicans and i just want to put them on notice 
that this plays both ways and were ready to play white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said in his surprise attack on 
tuesday 
a big part of the problem here is that in the dead of night a 
few years ago the democrats pushed through raising the limits to 
100000 per person he said 
i am sure the president is concerned about this becoming a 
campaign issue in 1992 said sen bob kerrey dneb a critic of 
the way the bailout is being managed and a target of the fitzwater 
attack 
new york gov mario cuomo says the sampl crisis will be a 
heavyweight issue for democrats in the 1992 presidential campaign 
cuomo who could be the democratic challenger next time is making 
it one of his issues now saying that because of lax regulators 
the bankers stole everything in sight they fouled up everything 
in sight and now you are paying 
sen christopher s bond rmo who wants bush to set up an 
independent commission to investigate the sampl situation said the 
real danger with this terrible crisis is that it will deteriorate 
into partisan warfare 
it is

a policeman in the medellin cartels 
hometown goes to work each day with an assault rifle a bulletproof 
vest and a prayer the drug lords will pay 4300 to anyone who 
kills him 
so far this year more than 120 have been slain 
policemen say they live on nerve and in fear of being the next 
victim 
some routinely arrive home with pistol drawn in case an assassin 
lurks in the shadows dozens of of the victims were murdered while 
off duty 
police in medellin are part of a national force of 80000 men 
which is part of the military and under defense ministry 
jurisdiction 
the government which declared war on drug traffickers last 
year has sent 1800 reinforcements in recent weeks to augment the 
normal force of 2600 the killings continue at an average of one a 
day in this city of 3 million colombias secondlargest 
if the same percentage of police officers was killed in new york 
city which has a force of 26000 the total would surpass 1000 
an associated press reporter talked with 30 medellin policemen 
and accompanied seven on a patrol of a dangerous part of medellin 
an officer pointed out the spots where six comrades had been killed 
in the past two months 
i get scared out here one said i see a movement in the 
shadows or hear a motorcycle moving toward me and the hair stands 
up on the back of my neck i wonder if this is it i wonder if im 
the next victim 
none wanted his name used figuring it would be a death warrant 
highranking medellin police officials refused to be interviewed 
about the dangers their men face the patrolmen said the drug 
cartels tactics had caused 300 police resignations in three months 
and recruiting was difficult 
im ready to quit if i dont get a transfer out of here 
soon a 20yearold policeman said were just statistics 
he and the others said they were frightened and exhausted by 
working up to 18 hours six days a week but most said they would 
not quit 
you can die of hunger too a 12year veteran commented 
their families are destroyed along with the policemen an 
officers widow gets only half his 95 monthly salary as a pension 
said a spokesman for the national police in bogota 
three widows said they could not support their children on that 
my children dont get milk they dont get meat they dont 
know what eggs taste like ruth duque said when they get sick 
we just pray there isnt any money for medicine 
mrs duques situation is even worse because she gets no pension 
at all her husband was killed march 23 1988 before the pension 
law was passed 
she said she makes the equivalent of about 102 a month working 
in a drugstore she feeds her son and daughter aged 4 and 3 one 
meal a day of rice and beans 
colombias minimum wage equals about 100 a month a quart of 
milk costs 75 cents and a onepound loaf of bread 1 
unemployment is over 30 percent in medellin according to 
sociologists at the local university the government says the rate 
is 10 percent but doesnt count thousands of people who mow lawns 
work as sidewalk peddlers or have other parttime jobs 
ive been looking for a job ever since my husband was 
killed said socorro rua her husband was killed may 19 by a man 
who stuck a gun in his ribs on a crowded bus 
her 15yearold daughter liliana turned her head away and 
tears coursed down her cheeks mrs rua also has a 6yearold son 
carlos 
they live in an apartment complex built by the government for 
policemen the shabby threeroom apartment costs only 20 a month 
but even that may be out of reach because officials have told her 
the pension paperwork will take a year 
another widow carmen montoya said she had high hopes for their 
children when her husband was alive but now we just try to get 
by day to day my little boy wanted a toy car for his birthday i 
cried when he asked me because i knew i couldnt afford it they 
dont get anything at christmas 
my little girl used to chatter and sing all the time before 
her daddy was killed she said now she just stares and hardly 
says a word 
i asked the police department to pay for a psychologist to see 
her but they told me there is no money for that 
mrs montoya has two children lina 5 and alexander 3 she 
receives about 80 a month because her husband had 20 years on the 
force

on a sunday morning 40 years ago 
north korea sent thousands of troops across the 38th parallel into 
south korea starting a war that killed more than a million people 
including 54000 american soldiers 
it is the only war the united states has entered in this century 
that remains unresolved the korean peninsula divided after world 
war ii still is split between the communist north and the 
capitalist south 
the invasion stunned and enraged the west the north koreans 
occupied seoul the south korean capital in three days and overran 
most of the southern half of the peninsula in six weeks 
fifteen nations sent soldiers to fight for south korea under the 
usled united nations command another 25 provided medical aid 
food and weapons 
china with war just across its border sent hundreds of 
thousands of soldiers to help the north 
when a ceasefire took effect 37 months later the losses were 
staggering an estimated 24 million soldiers and 44 million 
civilians killed or wounded military dead totaled more than 
800000 a land of remarkable beauty lay ravaged treeless burned 
jand barren 
the korean war was a traumatic chapter in american history and 
its impact on succeeding generations has been profound 
it was an inglorious war without victory often nearly 
forgotten patched into history between world war ii and vietnam 
no peace treaty has been signed 
it was a war in which we turned the tide against communism for 
the first time in a victory regrettably sometimes ignored by 
history president bush said at a dinner for veterans of the war 
korea was the first confrontation of the big powers in the 
nuclear age it intensified hostilities between east and west and 
and spurred a ussoviet arms race that only now is ending 
from it grew the notion that communism in east asia could be 
contained with help from the us military that led to american 
intervention in vietnam a decade later 
forty years after the battle north and south korea watch one 
another from behind barbed wire and concrete bunkers on either side 
of a demilitarized zone 2 miles wide and 155 miles long 
the single telephone line between them is in red cross offices 
there is no mail radio or television communication no direct 
travel without the permission of both governments which is hardly 
ever given 
nearly 9000 american military personnel still are unaccounted 
for or listed as prisoners 
last month in a gesture seen as a political overture to 
washington north korea returned what it said were the remains of 
five american soldiers it was the first such action since 1954 
the american korean war veterans association says it has reports 
from witnesses indicating some americans still may be alive in 
north korea or other communist countries 
sporadic dialogue has occurred between the koreas over the 
years but little progress has been made in lessening tension 
mutual suspicion and distrust they have accused each other of more 
than 1 million violations of the armistice agreement an average of 
75 a day since the war ended 
reunification of the peninsula long a dream of koreans on both 
sides remains elusive 
the united states keeps 43000 soldiers in south korea to deter 
another invasion there are plans to reduce the number but some 
us forces are expected to remain indefinitely 
for washington the conflict of 195053 was a war in which the 
politicians wrenched control from the generals it is remembered as 
much for president harry trumans firing of douglas macarthur as 
for the generals bold strategy of pushing the enemy back with an 
amphibious landing at inchon a western port 
historians divide the korean war into the first year of 
dramatic farreaching maneuvers and the next two years of static 
positional battle 
americans were not prepared mentally or physically for a war 
fought in foxholes and trenches on rugged mountainous terrain that 
was freezing in winter and scorching in summer 
no place was so cold so dirty grease from a hundred c rations 
was frozen to parkas and gloves underwear wasnt changed for 
months perspiration in boots turned to ice in winter blood froze 
on wounds before it could coagulate 
men fought handtohand for small pieces of territory called 
punchbowl pork chop hill heartbreak ridge bunker hill each 
changed hands many times 
more than 5 million men and women served in the american forces 
their casualties were 103284 wounded and 54246 dead including 
33629 killed in combat the infantry bore the brunt of the 
fighting 
what began as a crusade to save south korea from communism 
enjoyed only brief public popularity soldiers returned home not to 
a heros welcome but to a public dissatisfied with an unpopular 
unsatisfactory war 
weary soldiers disheartened and dispirited faded into the 
placid properous american society of the 1950s keeping their pain 
to themselves 
not until vietnam veterans received public attention did the 
korean vets begin to organize they formed an association five 
years ago and are trying to raise 105 million for a memorial 
korea is the only war without a memorial in washington 
in south korea the war is called the 625 incident reflecting 
the date it began and the korean preference for numbering rather 
than naming events 
some south koreans feel shame that the country needed help to 
defend itself and the anniversary is not a cause for celebration 
many people who remember those days remain deeply grateful to 
the americans monuments have been built in rice paddies and town 
squares to all nations that sent soldiers and aid 
the relationship between south korea and the united states has 
changed dramatically in the past 40 years south koreas booming 
economy and growing pride in its own accomplishments make it less 
tolerant of pressure from washington on economic trade and 
political issues 
antiamerican sentiment continues to grow visiting 
koreanamericans say relatives and others scold them for wearing 
americanstyle haircuts and clothes and for speaking korean with 
american accents 
most koreans disapprove of militants who burn us flags and 
shout yankee go home however and polls indicate they want 
american troops to remain

the pipe and wegee creeks two normally tranquil tributaries of 
the ohio river erupted june 15 when 5 inches of rain fell in less 
than three hours a wall of water 20 feet high and 300 feet wide 
as long as a football field tore through the hollows ripping 
asphalt from the ground snapping trees like toothpicks hurling 
cars in the air and sweeping people out of their homes 
it came so fast there was no warning 
but for every tragedy for every death there are amazing 
stories of survival in shadyside tales of people beating the odds 
literally hanging on for their lives helen saffle is one 
on the flood night the 54yearold diabetic was at home when 
the power went out and the water rushed in soon it was waisthigh 
the couch started to float she latched onto it she thought 
shed climb to the ceiling for air but when she looked the roof 
was gone 
the raging water smashed her house to pieces and sucked her out 
she grabbed a tank let go repeatedly ducked under the water to 
avoid debris 
i kept calm i prayed all the time she says then i came 
up against something solid it was a tree uprooted i was 
completely naked i had a gown but had pulled it off because it 
was smothering and choking me 
i remember at one time i thought this must be a dream she 
recalls i said no this is like the johnstown flood 
a rescuer eventually heard mrs saffles screams and carried her 
to safety she was bruised and cut but otherwise unharmed if it 
was gods will for me to die i would have he needed me for some 
reason 
perhaps it was divine intervention that brought the survivors 
through perhaps it was their own wits and willpower but many told 
similar stories 
nineyearold amber colvin and her babysitter kerri polivka 
tried to float in a bathtub the tub broke and kerri was killed 
but amber clung to a log and wooden shingles in the ohio river for 
seven hours before she was able to paddle to shore about seven 
miles from home 
i can doggie paddle a little but i only had to do that 
once she says ken gibbons who owned the nowdestroyed 3 ks 
night club grabbed his homes rafters as the house was ripped off 
its foundation it carried him about 800 yards 
you ever see a ball in a pinball machine thats what it was 
like i could hear it the house hitting stuff and crunching he 
says surveying his crushed 1979 red corvette and shiny 83 gold 
jaguar and clutching one of his remaining belongings the muddy 
1947 wedding certificate of his late parents 
his brother charlie whose trailer was destroyed was swept 
under a house as he tried to get his wife and neighbor onto a porch 
though charlie gibbons has heart trouble he climbed a tree 
inching higher as the water rose when youre scared youve got 
strength believe me he says puffing on a cigarette 
if his heart didnt get him and the water didnt get him 
says his wife fran he says hes going to live forever

a securities industry group pushing for 
passage of legislation to let the securities and exchange 
commission regulate stock index futures says it is growing more 
optimistic each day there is no vote 
i think right now its a tossup a week ago id say we were a 
decided underdog said joseph r hardiman president and chief 
executive of the national association of securities dealers give 
us more time and i think well prevail 
the nasd which oversees the overthecounter market is part of 
the ad hoc coalition for intermarket coordination thats been 
meeting with senators this week to push for passage of the 
amendement 
other members include the american stock exchange the boston 
stock exchange the chicago board of options exchange the pacific 
stock exchange and the national securities clearing corp 
last month the treasury department unveiled legislation that 
would strip the commodity futures trading commission of authority 
over stock index futures and give it to the rival sec 
the administration and the sec said the measure is necessary to 
prevent sharp rises and drops in market prices the futures 
industry and the cftc strongly oppose the bill 
the proposal also would give the sec authority to oversee stock 
index futures margins the downpayment required of investors who 
buy the contracts on credit 
the futures exchanges currently set those margins which are 
generally much lower than those of securities the sec and treasury 
have said low margins on stock index futures were partly to blame 
for the 1987 stock market crash and the 190point drop last october 
stock index futures allow investors to speculate on movements in 
the stock market without buying the underlying stocks 
the administration proposal was introduced as a separate bill in 
the house but will be included in cftc market reform legislation 
that has been pending since last fall 
our position is getting stronger with every day hardiman 
added if youd asked us a week ago we would have said heavens 
dont let them take a vote now today were saying things are 
looking a lot better because weve had an opportunity to tell our 
story and the more people we tell it to the more ears we get that 
are willing to listen 
in a joint interview with philadelphia stock exchange president 
nicholas a giordano and options clearing corp chairman wayne

the 18000 workers who will lose their jobs when 
ames department stores inc closes more than 200 stores this summer 
will receive vacation and severance pay under a plan approved in 
federal bankruptcy court 
judge howard c buschman iii authorized both the closures and 
the pay plan during a hearing thursday the pay plan which will 
cost ames 25 million also includes checks for 6600 workers laid 
off when ames closed some stores just before its april 25 chapter 
11 filing 
the employees have a stake in this company as well as 
everybody else buschman said i dont think anyone in this 
room is comfortable with the notion that there are 18000 people 
that are about to be terminated 
the judge approved the companys plan to pay vacation and 
severance benefits over the objection of a committee of the 
companys creditors 
the companys position is that were trying to save the 
jobs of 32000 people spokesman harris diamond said referring 
to the employees ames expects to retain the judge basically 
authorized them to go ahead 
the judge also approved the closure of 219 of ames 679 stores 
in the eastern united states and two distribution centers 
he delayed action until midjuly on a request to close two other 
stores after albert togut an attorney for employees claimed the 
stores werent unprofitable as ames had said 
the rocky hill connbased company filed for bankruptcy largely 
because of problems that stemmed from its 788 million acquisition 
of the zayre chain in 1988 that purchase transformed ames from a 
northeast retailer into the countrys fourthlargest discounter 
most of the stores slated for closure are former zayre stores 
the hearing was delayed for much of the day by the creation of a 
committee of eight former and current ames workers to represent 
employees 
the creditors committee had requested that laid off employees 
be paid only a portion of the vacation and severance pay due them 
buschman citing sympathy for the thousands of affected workers 
called for an employees committee to participate in negotiating an 
agreement 
an analyst at a new york investment firm that specializes in 
bankruptcies said bringing employees into the negotiations could 
set a precedent 
although it remains to be seen how much power the employees 
committee will have it would change the face of bankruptcy if 
you have to take them into account said steve lampe of rd 
smith 
the agreement calls for ames to pay 78 million in vacation pay 
to the 18000 workers and 165 million in severance pay it also 
calls for ames to pay 850000 in vacation pay to the 6600 
employees laid off just before the bankruptcy filing 
the company employed about 55000 people before the filing 
another part of the plan requires ames to assign advisors to 
each targeted store to help employees search for jobs and write 
resumes 
i recognize the tragedy the judge said i have been 
urging this debtor to give you people a good shot at getting jobs 
the judge also approved ames plan to conduct going out of 
business sales at the stores which are scheduled to close by the 
end of the summer 
the sales will be managed by jubilee co of columbus ohio and 
two other liquidation firms said george granoff president and 
chief operating officer of ames 
diamond said ames expects to receive 144 million from the sales 
on tuesday ames reported firstquarter losses of 4309 
million mostly because of the costs of closing stores the loss 
gave the discount retailer a negative stockholders equity or net 
worth of minus 74 million 
the stores to be closed are in connecticut florida illinois 
indiana kentucky maryland massachusetts michigan new 
hampshire new york north carolina ohio pennsylvania rhode 
island virginia and west virginia 
the distribution centers to be closed are in plant city fla 
and worcester mass 
on wednesday ames filed documents with buschman seeking 
permission to reject employment contracts it had signed with four 
former top executives the company said it cannot afford to 
continue paying the approximately 14 million a yar in salaries it 
owes to the four 
buschman has scheduled a hearing on the matter july 17

bankers working to cement a 65 million loan to 
keep donald trump from defaulting on millions in junk bond payments 
arent likely to finish the paperwork in time an individual 
involved in the talks said 
as a result the cashsqueezed developer is likely to need a 
separate shortterm loan to make a 43 million bond payment by a 
midnight tuesday deadline said the source who spoke thursday on 
condition of anonymity 
even if the banks complex plan to restructure trumps debt is 
approved by lenders there isnt enough time to finalize any 
agreement before the deadline the source said 
last friday trump missed the 43 million payment of interest 
and principal on two bond issues used to finance the trump castle 
hotel and casino in atlantic city nj 
under the terms of the bond covenants trump has a 10day grace 
period to make the payment before he can be declared in default 
defaulting on a total of 352 million in bonds could threaten 
trumps licenses from the new jersey casino control commission and 
lead to his losing control of the trump castle 
a default also could trigger other defaults in the developers 
casino and real estate empire and force trump to seek protection in 
bankruptcy court 
a plan to lend trump another 65 million and defer interest and 
principal payments has been held up by three japanese banks and a 
west german bank the four banks each hold 15 million worth of an 
outstanding 75 million loan made to trump by chase manhattan bank 
said the source 
the banks sumitomo bank mitsubishi bank daiichi kangyo bank 
and dresdner bank have balked at a plan to put a second lien on 
the trump tower the residential and commercial skyscraper on fifth 
avenue in manhattan the new york times reported thursday the 
banks loans are protected by the current lien on the building the 
newspaper said 
the times also reported that there was trouble in negotiations 
over whether cash flow from trumps properties would be directed to 
the new loans 
trumps ability to move money from his cashrich properties 
such as the trump plaza casino have helped him stay afloat 
analysts have said 
the bond agreement on the plaza allows trump to take all but 8 
million annually from the available cash flow he then can use the 
money to subsidize properties that drain cash such as 100 acres of 
abandoned railroad yards on manhattans upper west side 
thus far trump has taken 50 million out of the plaza in the 
form of dividends said larry klatzkin a bond analyst at shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
the downturn in the new york real estate market and the 
struggling atlantic city casino industry have cut into the amount 
of cash trump has to spread around his empire 
assuming the plaza continues generating cash trump would be 
able to draw on even more beginning next year the agreements with 
bondholders reached when the bonds were issued in 1986 will no 
longer require him to leave behind 8 million a year 
additionally he would be able to draw upon the money he has 
been forced to leave in the casino 
late thursday trump announced he sold a dutch shipyard near 
amsterdam for an undisclosed price trump bought the amels shipyard 
a little over a year ago for 5 million to ensure completion of 
work on a 420foot yacht new york newsday reported last month 
trump said through a spokesman howard rubenstein that he made 
a substantial profit on the sale

japans stubbornly high trade surplus with the 
united states is the result of natural factors not closed 
markets the trade ministry said in its annual report today 
the ministry said japan benefits by emphasizing exports of high 
value manufactured goods while the united states relies more on the 
sale of minerals and agricultural commodities 
the ministry of international trade and industrys 1989 white 
paper on trade and the economy also said statistics show japans 
mammoth overall trade surplus will continue to fall despite the 
yens relative weakness against other currencies 
the report was released as japan and the united states were 
preparing to meet june 25 for a final round of trade talks on 
economic reforms aimed at changing business practices and policies 
that inhibit trade and investment 
it said difficulties in slashing japans 49 billion trade 
surplus with the united states could be explained naturally 
a gradual recovery in us export competitiveness boosted us 
exports to japan 659 percent between 1986 and 1989 while us 
exports to the european community rose 629 percent it said 
but while the united states posted a 15 billion trade surplus 
with the ec last year a significant improvement over its 206 
billion deficit in 1987 it ran a 49 billion deficit with japan 
that was a slight improvement from a record 563 billion gap in 
1987 but still huge compared to 1980s 99 billion deficit 
according to the us commerce department 
the report attributed the slower recovery in the us trade 
balance with japan to the composition of goods traded 
higher value manufactured goods account for 806 percent of us 
exports to europe but only 58 percent of us exports to japan it 
said other exports to japan included grain meat lumber iron ore 
and coal 
the report said 781 percent of japans exports to the united 
states were machinery and transport goods for sustaining and 
expanding us domestic industrial activity in contrast 
european exports included more primary products it said 
japans exports are increasingly hightech products that are 
essential to the production and other economic activities of 
companies in the countries that are importing them the report 
said 
it said there were signs of a stable trend toward continued 
growth in imports and reduced reliance by japanese companies on 
exports despite the yens relative weakness against other major 
currencies 
the ministry said the yens average value fell to 138 to the 
dollar in 1989 from 1282 in 1988 in 1985 when the major 
industrial nations agreed to strengthen the yen to help correct 
trade imbalances the dollar bought 2385 yen 
economists have said a weaker yen which makes japanese products 
cheaper on world markets could abort efforts to curb the trade 
imbalance 
indeed the japanese government earlier this week said the 
countrys economy grew strongly in the three months ended in march 
because of a fresh surge in exports 
the trade ministry said japans total trade surplus in 1989 was 
7692 billion down from 9502 billion in 1988 
imports grew 125 percent to 2108 billion last year for the 
first time ever more than half of those imports 503 percent 
were manufactured goods the report said in 1985 only 31 percent 
of japans imports were manufactured goods 
we consider the fact that imports rose despite the weak yen 
to signify that import expansion is here to stay said kazukiyo 
higuchi director of mitis international trade research office

the streets of warsaw show an economic 
revolution in progress six months after the government jolted the 
country with marketoriented reform but the faces of the people 
show the human cost 
polands plunge into capitalism jan 1 was far bolder than any 
program undertaken by neighboring countries also shedding their 
communist past 
some people are obviously thriving new mercedes and volvos with 
polish license plates are a common sight on warsaw streets a few 
luxury boutiques sell dresses and suits for more than the average 
months salary and do not lack for customers 
there has been a general enlivening of commerce 
but there also is the pathetic sight of old people counting out 
a few zlotys to buy one or two rolls and the banners announcing 
the sale of gas guns to counter the crime wave that police experts 
blame on the hard times 
according to government statistics the country has entered a 
deep recession 
polands rocky experience during the first six months of 
switching to a market economy is giving pause to its giant neighbor 
to the east 
soviet officials so far have rejected radical economic reform 
along polish lines apparently admitting they do not have the 
political credibility to survive such a rapid transition 
instead soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov proposed in late may a 
regulated market economy that called for bread prices to triple 
july 1 and other prices to double jan 1 
panic buying and popular discontent forced postponement of the 
bread price increases 
such halfmeasures typified poland during the 1980s until 
solidarity came to power and its economists declared it was 
impossible to leap a wide chasm in short steps 
bolstered by strong popular support the solidarityled 
government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki instituted a plan 
that instantly liberated most prices after decades of control but 
kept wages tied down 
state subsidies for enterprises were ended the easy flow of 
bank credits were staunched by high interest rates the 
deficitridden state budget was balanced 
the polish zloty was made fully convertible inside poland 
backed by a 1 billion reserve fund lent by western nations that 
eliminated the confusing array of legal semilegal and illegal 
exchange rates 
after nearly six months the plans architect finance minister 
leszek balcerowicz can claim a certain success said polish 
economics journalist krzystof bien in an interview 
what he has managed to do so far has never been accomplished 
before he said 
however it is not yet the stage that would permit us to say 
that we are irrevocably on the road to a market economy everything 
we have achieved so far could be destroyed in a day bien said 
the chief potential danger he said is a resurgence of 
inflation if the government relaxes its strict pay policies in 
response to recent industrial strikes and protests by small private 
farmers 
taming runaway inflation estimated at more than 1000 percent 
in 1989 has been the greatest achievement of the program so far 
prices spiked up when the plan was launched but the tight controls 
on wages and lending soon brought them down 
statistics tell the story prices grew 79 percent in january 24 
percent in february 47 percent in march 81 percent in april and 
5 percent in may 
freeing prices while holding down wages had an immediate effect 
on supplies in stores suddenly the chronic shortages evaporated 
because of the drop in demand caused by the high pricetags then as 
supplies become more reliable consumers stopped hoarding further 
helping keep the shelves stocked 
for consumers with money poland has become if not yet a 
shoppers paradise at least a country where one can find most of 
lifes essentials and a few luxuries without irritating lines or 
complicated barters bribes and deals 
sellers are chasing buyers and not the other way around as 
before former luxuries such as bananas and lemons are now sold on 
the street and food stands that have sprung up serve customers at 
night on weekends and on holidays warsaw even has a 24hour 
french grocery 
on the down side unemployment is about 400000 people or about 
3 percent of the work force joblessness officially nonexistent a 
year ago is expected to grow to 9 percent or 13 million people 
this year 
faced with high interest rates and reduced demand many 
factories slowed production to a trickle output by government 
industry is down about 30 percent the dire picture is probably 
offset somewhat by increased production in the private sector where 
government statistics are less reliable 
with wages tied down by punitive taxes and prices steadily 
rising especially in january and february real incomes dropped 
dramatically down about 40 percent according to official 
statistics but again the numbers do not fully reflect the 
burgeoning private business activity 
i am an optimist said slawomir rudnicki the proud coowner 
of the new french grocery it would have been impossible to open 
this shop a few years ago 
but in the next breath he goes on to present a long list of 
complaints against petty officials and regulations that still 
hinder business like the rule that the bottled mineral water he 
imports be submitted to a health check each time his truck crosses 
the polish border

pathe communications corp got four 
more months to try to acquire mgmua communications co with a new 
deal that raises the purchase price by 100 million the companies 
said 
the new arrangement was announced thursday amid questions over 
whether pathes top financial backer time warner inc would bow 
out of the deal due to concerns pathe was borrowing too much money 
under the new 13 billion acquisition plan holders of common 
and preferred mgmua stock will receive 2150 per share up from 
the original buyout price of 20 a share pathe and mgmua said 
but stockholders now will receive payments of 4 a share on july 
20 with the balance of 1750 expected to be paid on or before 
oct 23 of this year the deadline for the former deal was to have 
been saturday 
pathe headed by italian financier giancarlo parretti has 
extended its offer several times past its original closing date of 
april 30 
part of the 4 payment will come out of an escrow account into 
which pathe already has deposited 200 million the additional 53 
million necessary to make the 4 payment to stockholders of record 
on july 10 is to be deposited by pathe on july 16 
pathe intends to merge a newly formed subsidiary with mgmua 
and mgmua will seek shareholder approval for the merger kirk 
kerkorians tracinda corp said it has agreed to vote for the 
merger 
pathe is obligated to consummate a tender offer if the merger is 
not concluded for any reason 
in support of the acquisition pathe will deliver to escrow an 
additional 100 million consisting of two installments of 50 
million each to be paid on aug 21 and sept 20 of this year 
pathes problems are with its chief backer time warner inc 
which has agreed to loan pathe 650 million time warner would get 
a lien on the united artists movie library distribution rights to 
that library and distribution rights to future pathe and mgmua 
releases as part of the deal 
according to a published report thursday time warner was 
contemplating pulling out of the deal daily variety citing 
anonymous sources said time warner was considering the move 
because pathe was relying on debt and not equity to finance its 
purchase of mgmua 
time warner has insisted the 600 million remaining to close the 
deal must not come from borrowed funds and that pathe put up 450 
million of that equity itself 
but pathe said in a statement thursday negotiations with time 
warner were continuing 
a time warner spokeswoman agreed 
we assume that the purpose of pathes obtaining the extension 
is to continue our discussions as to how pathe can satisfy the 
conditions of our agreement and we are continuing the 
discussions said spokeswoman marilyn harris 
she would not comment on the daily variety report 
mgmua has been virtually dormant in movie production during the 
past two years since kerkorian put the company on the auction 
block 
so far pathe head parrettis proposed patchwork of loans 
through european affiliates of pathe has failed to meet time 
warners criteria

opec president sadek boussena friday 
reiterated a warning to the oil cartels members that they face an 
imminent collapse in sagging prices if they continue producing 
excessively 
the situation is very serious and id say its alarming if 
something is not done immediately to stop the slide in prices he 
told a news conference 
boussena algerias mines minister arrived in baghdad thursday 
on the first stop of a tour of middle east oil producers seeking to 
secure adherence to a may 2 geneva agreement to limit production to 
221226 million barrels to day and shore up sinking oil prices 
he had warned the 13member organization of oil exporting 
countries earlier this month that if they did not stick to the 
agreement prices will drop through the floor as they did in 1986 
the nicosiabased middle east economic survey a respected 
weekly oil review estimated current opec production at 2368 
million barrels a day 
oil prices have recently slumped to 15 a barrel from opecs 
benchmark of 18 
boussena said the objective of his tour is to study ways of 
propping up prices 
he declined to indentify the opec members who are producing more 
than their quotas but the main violators are believed to be kuwait 
and the united arab emirates 
iraqs oil minister issam abdulrahim alchalabi did not 
hesitate to name the uae as one of the principal overproducers 
great harm is being done because the uae is not part of the 
agreement chalabi told the news conference 
theres no justification whatever for giving away one barrel 
free for every three barrels we sell its simply unjustifiable and 
illogical he said 
boussena said were all suffering great losses but some of 
us are feeling the burden more than others because of their 
requirements and their economic and social problems 
boussena ruled out convening an emergency meeting of opec oil 
ministers to consider the crisis but he said the next scheduled 
meeting on july 26 will do so 
he said he saw no reason why some members were not abiding by 
the agreement 
im not convinced by the reasons they give for their 
undisciplined behavior its simply illogical that they are 
overproduciung to sell their oil at cheaper prices while they could 
keep it and sell it at higher prices when the market situation 
improves he said 
if the organization wants stable prices then it should have a 
solid and durable agreement on production and prices he added 
but he sounded pessimistic on the prospect of general acceptance 
of an agreement 
we only have the solidarity among us to respect our 
obligations and to abide by the agreements he added 
boussena is scheduled to visit saudi arabia and other gulf 
states in the next few days

a federal communications commission order that 
local phone companies reduce their access charges by 11 billion 
nationwide is expected to result in a further reduction in 
longdistance rates 
the fcc on thursday ordered the cut in rates charged to 
longdistance companies for access to local phone networks 
effective july 1 longdistance carriers typically pass along to 
their customers savings from such cuts 
american telephone amp telegraph co the nations largest 
longdistance company announced last month it would cut its rates 
by 160 million annually effective july 1 in anticipation of the 
fcc decision this would mean a cut of 25 percent in typical 
evening rates 
other phone companies such as mci communications corp and us 
sprint usually follow suit to remain competitive 
atampt has decided on deeper rate reductions however since it 
had based its cuts on local phone company proposals to the fcc the 
local companies in april had asked to reduce their access charges 
by just 405 million on july 1 
the fcc ordered an additional 696 million cut thursday saying 
the local phone companies had underestimated likely calling demand 
by about 24 percent or 7 billion minutes 
the fcc also based its rate reductions in part on corrections 
of the local phone companies cost estimates 
there will be some further reduction beyond the 160 million 
atampt proposed may 17 atampt spokesman herb linnen said i dont 
know how much buts its good news for residential and small 
business customers 
he said atampt probably would announce additional cuts next week 
we expect atampt to file reductions in its rates to reflect 
these further reductions said kelly cameron an official in the 
fccs common carrier division 
cameron said the longdistance price cuts would not necessarily 
be a direct flowthrough of access charge savings 
before july 1989 when atampts earnings were restricted to about 
a 12 percent rate of return on its investment the flowthrough of 
costs generally were nearly automatic 
but atampt now is under a regulatory scheme that controls its 
prices within a prescribed range tied to the rate of inflation not 
its profits 
atampts may proposal for 25 percent evening reductions would 
reduce the price of a 10minute directdialed call to anywhere in 
the united states to 153 or less from 158 sunday through 
friday 5 pm to 11 pm 
atampts prices have dropped more than 40 percent since 1984 
separately thursday atampt began offering corporate phone rates 
that match those of its competitors while undercutting rates atampt 
is allowed to charge under its governmentapproved tariffs 
a fivemonth waiting period for the plan under fcc rules expired 
at midnight wednesday said atampt spokesman andy myers 
under the plan atampt must seek government approval each time it 
signs a contract to offer phone rates to a specific customer that 
match those offered to the customer by competitors and are lower 
than atampt is allowed to offer under its tariffs myers said 
in addition the fcc has an additional 12 to 15 months to 
continue its investigation into the socalled tariff 15 plan and 
could decide to disallow the plan during that period said john 
cimko chief of the fccs tariff division 
so far atampt has filed seven requests involving customers such 
as cbs inc and pepsico to offer competitive rates under tariff 
15 myers said 
the rate plan that went into effect thursday is for resort 
condominiums international inc of indianapolis cimko said the 
plan in effect was a test case for tariff 15 
under fcc rules atampt must gain the commissions approval for 
all rate changes while competitors may change rates at will 
however the fcc has said it will examine whether it should relax 
that requirement

firefighters have extinguished a fire at a 
siberian oil tank farm that was ignited by a direct lightning 
strike and spread to 22 acres the evening newspaper izvestia said 
friday 
the newspaper said it took firemen a full day to put out the 
blaze that engulfed at least four of the oil stations 24 tanks at 
the karkateyevy station near nefteyugansk in the tyumen oil region 
of western siberia 
the tass news agency said on thursday that the reservoirs at the 
station contain a total of 380000 tons of oil it said 160 firemen 
used 28 pieces of equipment to douse the blaze 
no one was injured in the blaze and evacuation of the area was 
not necessary izvestia said 
according to the regional executive committee negligence was 
partly to blame for the blaze which broke out wednesday night 
lightning rods were not working and there was no special foam 
to extinguish the blaze it said also taps on the pipes were 
not working and oil was going through them while they were 
burning 
the newspaper did not give any estimate of damage or oil loss

a cutback in bank lending for commercial real 
estate construction and corporate mergers hasnt harmed the economy 
as a whole federal reserve chairman alan greenspan says 
with the exception perhaps of the troublesome situation in 
the new england region credit availability more broadly appears 
not to be significantly impaired greenspan told the senate 
banking committee on thursday 
enough credit appears to be available to fuel economic 
growth nationally he said but he also warned significant 
problems cannot be ruled out in the period ahead 
we are attentive to the possibility that this more cautios 
stance in the granting of credit could cumulate to threaten the 
economic expansion greenspan said 
although fewer loans are being made to finance construction and 
mergers the caution was justified by deteriorating conditions in 
those areas and was not a result of a crackdown by bank examiners 
the central bank chief said 
greenspan was disputed by commerce secretary robert a mosbacher 
who issued a statement to the committee saying while real 
estate lending has been especially slow this year other lending 
has also been reduced especially hardhit have been small and 
mediumsized businesses 
he added while the credit problem differs by region it 
appears to be national in scope substantial credit is essential 
for us firms to meet the challenge of foreign competition he 
said 
at the same time a senior federal deposit insurance corp 
official warned that commercial real estate difficulties were 
spreading beyond new england and the southwest and were likely to 
get worse before they get better 
we do expect some continuing slowing and softness in the real 
estate markets said paul g fritts fdic director of bank 
supervision we dont think its bottomed out in new england yet 
we see some softness beginning to develop in california 
greenspan sought to reassure worried new england lawmakers as 
well as senators from pennsylvania maryland and florida who said 
business people in their areas are reporting great difficulty 
getting loans for what they consider creditworthy projects 
some examiners and bankers may have turned overly cautious 
greenspan said but whatever overreaction that may have occurred 
does not appear to have been widespread 
access to credit has not been reduced to an extent that it has 
had a dampening influence on the american economy overall he 
said 
however rep joseph p kennedy dmass who appeared before 
the senate panel as a witness said many bankers and people in 
the business community say that while regulators may not have 
caused the economic downturn they sure have greased the pole 
sen john kerry dmasssaid residents of the northeast are 
effectively paying for the savings and loan crisis twice they are 
paying for 47 percent of the bailout while only 10 percent of the 
costs are attributed to sampl failures in the region he said 
now regulators are being too tough on institutions in the 
northeast for fear of repeating the mistakes they made in the 
southwest kerry said 
however sen jake garn of utah senior republican on the 
banking committee warned against criticizing regulators too 
harshly noting that they were pressured to ease up when economic 
trouble first hit savings and loans in the southwest 
lets be careful you dont have to have a long memory to 
remember that we went through this before he said this 
senator if he has to err will err on the side of tougher 
regulation

is backed up by the power of a supercomputer or minisuper with 
the numbercrunching power to assess the impact of interest rate 
shifts on individual bonds or portfolios containing dozens of bonds 
were in a technical business theres no doubt about it 
says tony vignola head of fixedincome research at kidder peabody 
amp co the capability of analyzing and processing information 
quickly is becoming an ever increasing means of staying competitive 
in the business 
technologys biggest inroads have been in the field of 
mortgagebacked securities whose complex structures demand raw 
computing power 
these securities represent packages of thousands of individual 
mortgages some fixedrate and some variable with different 
prepayment risks whats more the securities often are packaged 
further into structures like collateralized mortgage obligations 
or cmos which group bonds in tiers of increasing risk and compound 
the complexity 
basically all the value is in the details and there are 
zillions of details says vincent pica cohead of institutional 
strategies at prudentialbache securities inc 
prubache last year bought a lowend supercomputer from intel 
corp and recently upgraded the machine using the companys latest 
highspeed computer chip 
the ipsc860 or hypercube as its called helps the investment 
bank to design new mortgage bond structures and to assess 
securities in the secondary market 
the machine can evaluate how the bottom tier of a cmo will 
perform under scores of interest rate scenarios in about 90 
seconds compared with about 20 minutes for a desktop workstation 
pica says entire portfolio analyses that used to be done overnight 
now can be crunched out during the trading day 
that speed means business whether its spotting a market 
opportunity for the firm or finding a trade for a client while the 
client waits on the phone 
the race is to the swift pica says 
elliot swan manager of intels sales to the financial services 
industry says the company has targeted its sales effort at up to 
200 large investment banks insurance companies and other 
institutional heavyweights 
everyone is overwhelmed with data swan says making sense 
of the data is really what this is all about 
the state of the streets technology can be hard to gauge says 
gary smaby who runs a research firm in minneapolis that bears his 
name the hardware itself plus the applications software that 
allows bankers to manipulate bond data is guarded jealously by 
firms seeking a competitive edge he says 
we dont want to discuss what were doing for competitive 
reasons says peter roche a spokesman at morgan stanley amp co 
the recent squeeze on wall streets earnings may be slowing the 
spread of highpriced supercomputers prubache declined to say 
what it spent on its hypercube intel says the machine ranges from 
250000 to 3 million with the most likely wall street model 
selling for around 1 million 
union bank of switzerland has invested about 450000 in a 
lowpowered hypercube at its new york securities operation in the 
past year says christian gabathuler the banks us head of 
information systems the bank has used the machine only for 
research but hopes to put it to work in its credit market 
operations by the end of the year he says 
more common are socalled minisupercomputers says smaby they 
dont offer the computing speed of a true super but they cost much 
less and can handle complex bond calculations many times faster 
than a workstation 
torque computer inc sells a sort of turbocharged box for about 
100000 that can increase a workstations computing speed as much 
as 50 times says sam bogoch the companys president 
you literally turn hours into minutes he says 
that kind of power is fast becoming indispensable in wall 
streets race to design more exotic bonds and find extra basis 
points of yield 
as pica says of prubaches supercomputer one year from now 
were all going to look back and say how did intelligent life 
exist without this thing

garfinckels one of the washington areas 
oldest upscale retailers will lay off a fourth of its employees 
close seven department stores and open two smaller specialty stores 
for women 
the retailer announced the changes thursday after filing for 
protection from creditors under chapter 11 in the us bankruptcy 
court for the district of columbia 
garfinckels existing business structure cannot produce either 
the merchandising mix or financial performance for the company to 
viably serve its customers or meet its debt obligations george 
p kelly chairman and chief executive officer of garfinckels 
said garfinckels does not have the economies of scale given 
its reduced revenue base and market share since 1987 to be a 
competitive retailer in this marketplace 
the retailer is owned by an investment group headed by middle 
eastern investor wafic said said also owns a major stake in 
washington bancorporation the parent company of the troubled 
national bank of washington 
in recent years garfinckels had been struggling to overcome 
changes in ownership a heavy debt burden taken on to prevent a 
leveraged buyout and competition from other large stores such as 
seattlebased nordstrom inc that have come to the washington area 
a spokesperson for the company who asked to remain anonymous 
said 200 of the companys 850 employees will be laid off 
immediately 
garfinckels nine stores all located in the metropolitan 
washington area will remain open through an inventory liquidation 
process the spokesperson said the liquidation process which will 
take about 60 days will be directed by schottenstein stores corp 
officials said 
the company will sell their leases on seven of the stores and 
will seek to reorganize and open two smaller specialty stores for 
women those stores will be located in prestigious georgetown park 
and connecticut avenue 
a release issued by kelly thursday said the consumers 
preference for specialty stores apparently led to the companys 
demise along with numerous changes in ownership 
changing ownership five times since the early 1980s subjected 
garfinckels to different marketing strategies so that its image 
among customers became significantly impaired kelly said this 
was compounded by the deterioriating condition of the retailing 
industry generally following a number of recent bankruptcies 
garfinckels holding co is the parent company of garfinckels 
the store currently has locations in washington and suburban 
maryland and virginia 
garfinckels once was a division of allied stores corp it was 
sold after the 1986 acquisition of allied by canadas campeau corp

an undercover fbi agent in a wideranging probe 
of corruption at the worlds biggest commodities exchanges was no 
bumpkin a federal prosecutor said today in concluding his case 
against three traders 
randall jannett who posed as a corrupt trader at the chicago 
mercantile exchange was a special special agent who 
accurately recalled how the three men all traders in the swiss 
franc pit cheated their customers assistant us attorney james 
p fleissner told jurors at the us district trial before judge 
ann c williams 
ladies and gentlemen randall jannett was no bumpkin 
fleissner said 
defense attorneys for the defendants robert d mosky danny 
scheck and david zatz argued throughout the sixweek trial that 
jannett was in over his head incompetent at discerning what were 
and were not legitimate trades 
thursday moskys attorney elliot samuels told the 12member 
jury that his client was being unfairly blamed for ambiguous 
trading rules at the commodities exchanges 
federal prosecutors contend mosky was the ringleader of a group 
of traders in the mercs swiss franc futures pit who routinely 
stole money from customers through various illegal trading schemes 
that prevented the customer orders from being executed in the open 
market 
but samuels backed by testimony from a merc official contended 
a key trading rule that mosky allegedly broke is subject to 
interpretation according to the customs and practices of the 
marketplace 
heres the governments game folks lets call the conduct 
fraudulent and lets indict the guy samuels told the jury near 
the end of his twohour closing argument 
if theyre not happy with the damn rules let them go to 
washington and get congress to change it but dont bob put mosky 
in jail because of it samuels said 
congress already is addressing the vagueness of some commodity 
trading rules as part of a periodic examination of the industry 
that has taken on added weight after the chicago corruption probe 
samuels referred specifically to the interpretation of open 
outcry trading the accepted method of commodity futures trading 
in which traders crowd into recessed pits to buy and sell 
contracts for future deliveries of commodities through a 
combination of hand signals and shouted bids and offers 
the federal charges are rooted in the premise that the 
defendants executed customer orders through prearranged or 
offmarket trades instead of through open outcry thus depriving 
the customers of the supposedly superior prices that result from 
competitive trading 
the government contends the defendants used the profits from the 
illegal trades to cover their personal losses from trading errors 
samuels cited the testimony of merc executive vice president 
gerald beyer who indicated during crossexamination that the 
precise definition of a legitimate bid or offer whether a 
wordless hand gesture is sufficient for example depends on the 
customs of each trading pit 
samuels said the government had not proved that mosky had not 
executed customer orders through open outcry samuels suggested 
undercover fbi agent randall jannett merely missed moskys legal 
trades then mistook the ensuing confirmation discussion between 
the traders as illegal offmarket trading 
this is the first trial resulting from an unprecedented 
undercover fbi probe of corruption at the merc and the chicago 
board of trade the worlds two biggest commodity exchanges in 
all 48 people were indicted and 16 already have pleaded guilty 
two other groups of traders face september trials 
mosky scheck and zatz face more than a dozen counts each of 
mail or wire fraud and violations of the commodity exchange act 
each count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a 
150000 fine 
mosky also is charged with racketeering conspiracy for which he 
could be sent to prison for 20 years and be forced to forfeit 
personal assets including exchange membership

president bush accused by members of congress 
of being too sluggish on enforcement of savings and loan fraud 
today asked lawmakers to double spending for the crackdown 
we will not rest until the cheats and the chiselers and the 
charlatans spend a large chunk of their lives behind the bars of a 
federal prison bush said in a speech to us attorneys at the 
justice department 
the president also announced his support for an amendment to 
pending crime legislation that would devote more internal revenue 
service and justice department investigators and prosecutors to 
financial fraud cases 
bush is asking congress to increase next years spending from 
the current 50 million to 100 million in the 1991 budget year 
for 1990 the administration sought and received only 50 million 
even though congress had authorized 75 million 
bush also announced he was establishing a new position in the 
attorney generals office a special counsel for financial 
institution fraud who will coordinate investigations and 
prosecutions in that area 
on capitol hill democrats lashed out at the presidents 
initiative as inadequate 
its too little and woefully late said rep charles 
schumer dny a member of the house banking committee he said 
100 million may have been enough for 1990 but it is not enough 
for 1991 
the administration is now moving only because the political 
heat is up said sen howard m metzenbaum dohio 
bush said his administration is sending out teams of razor 
sharp prosecutors and auditors recruited from their departments 
and other agencies striking city by city teams that will jump 
right into the paper chase teams that will hit the trail while 
that trail is still hot 
bush was criticized by members of congress this year for failing 
to take advantage of the full 75 million they authorized last 
august when they passed the savings and loan bailout package 
congress subsequently appropriated only the 50 million bush had 
asked for 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said the administration could 
not use the full 75 million during the startup phase of the 
intensified sl crackdown but in the fiscal year 1991 wants to 
spend 100 million 
in addition to beefing up the investigative and prosecutorial 
forces the administrations legislative package would authorize 
wiretaps in bank fraud and financial fraud cases freezing of 
personal and corporate assets of civil defendants in financial 
fraud cases and barring use of bankruptcy to avoid damages and 
penalties in these cases 
among those under investigation by thrift regulators is bushs 
son neil bush of denver a former director of silverado banking 
savings and loan one of the failed associations involved in the 
sampl probe 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater on thursday 
defended the administrations antifraud efforts democratic 
critics have complained that the justice department has a backlog 
of nearly 7000 cases 
fitzwater said last year there were 791 convictions for 
financial institution fraud involving losses of 100000 each 
since 1987 he said the government has issued 184 major sampl 
indictments with 159 convictions 
the justice department has 530 failed institutions under 
investigation up from 282 three years ago fitzwater said 
with the 50 million already appropriated for this fiscal year 
the justice department is hiring 368 new employees including 202 
fbi agents and 120 prosecutors 
the department says it is creating special offices in 27 cities 
to go after financial institution fraud 
congressional critics pointed out however that us attorneys 
offices around the country asked for an additional 231 prosecutors 
and fbi field offices asked for more than 400 additional agents 
criticism on capitol hill has mounted with the administrations 
announcement a month ago that the sampl cleanup costs would be far 
greater than originally thought 
the estimates now range from 89 billion to 132 billion and 
officials have said the administration would need from 30 billion 
to more than 50 billion more in the next fiscal year alone 
fitzwater this week lashed out at democrats who he said are 
trying to politicize the savings and loan issue he said many 
democratic lawmakers share the blame for the debacle which 
mushroomed during the reagan administration years bush said he 
approved of fitzwaters statements

former drexel burnham lambert inc trading 
assistant lisa jones was sentenced today to 10 months in prison for 
lying to the government during its investigation of the wall street 
firm 
the punishment was eight months less than jones received at her 
original sentencing last year that term was thrown out by a 
federal appeals court that said the sentence was longer than 
prescribed by federal sentencing guidelines 
us district judge leonard b sand also ordered the onetime 
teenage runaway who climbed to a 100000ayear job at drexel to 
pay 25000 in fines plus the cost of her incarceration 
jones 27 was convicted by a federal jury in march 1989 of 
seven counts of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a 
federal grand jury investigating trading activities at drexel 
she was the first person convicted in the governments lengthy 
investigation of fraud on wall street 
prosecutors showed at her trial that jones handled transactions 
that constituted illegal stock parking which involves hiding 
the true ownership of securities jones had denied any knwowledge 
of such transactions 
jones worked at drexels beverly hills calif junk bond 
department as a trading assistant to bruce newberg who was 
convicted last year of parking and other charges and sentenced to 
three months in prison 
newberg reported directly to michael milken the exhead of 
drexels junk bond department who pleaded guilty to six felonies 
earlier this year to settle wideranging securities fraud charges 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in march ruled that sand 
wrongly gave jones a sentence greater than the 10 to 16month term 
recommended by new sentencing guidelines governing crimes that 
occurred after january 1987 
sand originally had added on to the term on grounds that jones 
perjury had severly impeded the governments drexel investigation 
sand said today that jones perjury was not a sudden impulse 
it was a persistent conduct of perjury on several occasions despite 
warnings from the government 
jones who sobbed throughout the 90minute sentencing was 
ordered to continue to receive mental health therapy during her 
term she is to report to a minimumsecurity prison camp in phoenix 
in 30 days

that means us bankruptcy court judge joseph l cosetti will 
proceed with a june 28 hearing on the companys reorganization 
plan despite pleas from the firm japonica partners and bank 
creditors who want more time to settle their differences and come 
up with a plan that can be approved 
japonica which has purchased millions of dollars of the 
companys creditor claims told cosetti that creditors had rejected 
its 661 million reorganization plan 
the plan was approved overwhelmingly by the classes of creditors 
japonica holds controlling interest in unsecured creditors and 
subordinated debtholders but opposition from bank creditors and 
common stockholders was enough to derail the plan 
joy flowers conti a lawyer representing the banks said 
proceeding with allegheny internationals 687 million plan will 
spark extensive litigation among the company japonica and creditor 
groups 
but cosetti said thursday that allowing japonica and the banks 
more time to negotiate a settlement would only delay the day it 
emerges from bankruptcy

technology has been a major reason for the 
united states success in the world agriculture market but this 
country risks losing its prominence experts said at a conference 
the day has passed when american agriculture had a lock on the 
world marketplace for food us agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said 
he joined international food experts scholars and businessmen 
in indianapolis in april to discuss global food trends during the 
1990s at a conference sponsored by the conservative think tank 
hudson institute 
the united states held 35 percent of the value of world trade in 
bulk agriculture commodities in 1988 yeutter said but in 
intermediate products such as flours and vegetable fats the us 
share dropped to 18 percent among consumeroriented agriculture 
products such as processed fruits cut flowers and bakery 
products american farmers have less than a 6 percent stake 
in the past year eastern europe has begun moving toward free 
market systems that wont help american farmers but it may be a 
windfall for food processors one analyst said 
richard judy a soviet specialist at the hudson institute said 
there will be a demand for companies involved in food processing 
and marketing 
one of them is central soya based in fort wayne since january 
it has formed joint ventures with hungarys stateowned 
agribusiness concern to produce livestock feed and with a 
yugoslavian company to produce soybean concentrates used in meat 
processing 
bioprocessing represents another opportunity genetically 
engineered microorganisms will be used to produce food fuel 
industrial feedstocks and commodity chemicals from corn sugar cane 
and other crops said john r campbell president of oklahoma state 
university 
however such products may meet resistance including consumer 
fears 
technology has been one of the major reasons for the success 
in american agriculture said john urbanchek a senior vice 
president for economics in the washington office of the consulting 
firm hill and knowlton inc 
the problem is that the contribution of current technology is 
being rapidly exhausted and must be replaced if the us is to 
retain its prominence as an agricultural producer and exporter and 
to continue to supply american consumers with highquality safe 
and reasonably priced food he said 
duane acker a former agriculture official with the us agency 
for international development said this countrys system of 
research and farm extension once was the envy of the world 
accounting for an estimated 75 percent of the public funds invested 
in that area 
today estimates place that figure at 25 percent or less acker 
said 
though we continue to brag about our excellent system we no 
longer have a corner on knowledge or technology said acker now 
an administrator at the us department of agriculture 
to help the united states attain a globally oriented and 
internationally competitive agriculture system by the year 2000 
acker called for investment in agriculture research links with 
gene banks and research institutions around the world and us 
investment in developing countries

excalibur automobile corp manufacturer of 
neoclassic automobiles fancied by wealthy collectors has suspended 
production after being rocked by layoffs lawsuits bounced 
paychecks and allegations of mileage tampering 
the suburban milwaukee company whose cars feature a minimum 
price tag of 75000 hopes the restructuring will raise enough 
capital to move forward with a planned venture in japan 
almost everybody likes to be part of excalibur and the cars 
and the lifestyle image said scott dennison who took over as 
president june 1 after the resignation of henry a warner 
if we could build 120 cars a year we could be profitable 
were really not in the car business were in the toy business 
dennison said 
the company has been producing its 1930sstyle cars at a rate of 
just one per week since january and has a backlog of 76 vehicles 
employees incensed by unpaid wages about 40 layoffs and 
allegations the company used old parts in new cars picketed the 
company this week threatening to set back any rebound by the 
27yearold company 
only five of the companys 45 workers remain on staff after the 
layoffs this month 
weve used up just about all the tolerance we had said dan 
neilson a laidoff technician and one o the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the soviet union has been 
staunchly opposed 
west germany now is a mainstay of nato and east germany is a 
member of the sovietled warsaw pact 
shevardnadze said the soviet proposal seeks to limit the 
strength of the german armed forces and to revamp their structure 
to make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensive 
operations 
it said those reductions could be undertaken over a threeyear 
period germany also would be prevented from producing or deploying 
chemmical or nuclear weapons 
it also said that within six months of unification all western 
troops should leave west berlin which remains technically under 
military occupation by the united states france and britian 
the four nations would reduce their military forces in the 
country during a threeyear period following unification first by 
50 percent then bring them down to a level of token contingents 
or completely withdraw them from germany 
there are about 380000 soviet troops in east germany while a 
quartermillion us troops are stationed in west germany along 
with tens of thousands of british and french soldiers 
previously the soviets had said their troops would stay in what 
is now east germany for several years but had left unclear the 
exact plans for pulling them out 
shevardnadze speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of 
the western allies checkpoint charlie said he wanted the big four 
powers troops out of greater berlin within six months after 
unification 
the proposal as translated into english by the soviets and 
distributed to the news media apparently would also include the 
kremlins soldiers stationed just outside the city proper 
the united states france and great britain have an estimated 
12000 troops in west berlin an official reached by telephone in 
the office of the military attache at the soviet embassy in east 
berlin said there were no soviet troops stationed in the city 
proper

crop futures prices closed moderately lower 
friday on the chicago board of trade as forecasts for drier weather 
in the midwest prompted some profittaking after strong gains 
during the week 
drier conditions would allow farmers to finish soybean planting 
which has been delayed by excessive rain in some of the most 
productive soybean regions notably parts of illinois and missouri 
the general perception among traders though is that crop 
conditions overall are improving analysts said 
william biedermann research director with the futures brokerage 
allendale inc said fridays selling was led by speculators and 
commodity investment funds but he said the corn and soybean 
markets were underpinned by strong support among grain handlers 
at the close wheat futures prices were 4 cents lower to cent 
higher with july at 334 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents 
lower with july at 282 a bushel oats were 5 cents to 6 cents 
lower with july at 134 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 7 
cents lower with july at 6 a bushel

take a ride around austin these days and 
youre likely to spot a bunch of college students tossing white 
towels in the air 
no its not some fraternity or sorority prank theyre 
imitating pizzadough tossing to help generate business for hwy 
pizza a fledgling company that takes carryout to new heights of 
convenience 
without ever leaving their cars motorists can buy readytobake 
pizzas for 495 from one of 11 roadside carts 
businessman kerry wood 37 started the business with about 
40000 in late 1988 after first having the idea researched by 
university of texas graduate students 
but wood said he already had a pretty good idea about the people 
who would buy many of his pizzas working women between the ages of 
24 and 49 with children 
i think we knew this prior to the study that it was real 
attractive to working mothers because of the convenience of picking 
it up and the fact that theyre doing it cooking at home and the 
children like to help make it said wood a lima ohio native 
its a lot of fun for them to make it it becomes their 
dinner and a way to help mom out he said 
wood said he gets calls almost every day from customers praising 
the timesaving product 
the basic pizza kit includes a 14inch crust in an ovenready 
disposable pan tomato sauce and cheese each extra ingredient 
pepperoni black and green olives jalapenos mushrooms canadian 
bacon hamburger and italian sausage is 50 cents 
one pizza will feed a husband wife and two small children 
wood said 
wood estimates that about 110000 pizzas have been sold since 
the business opened about 18 months ago his pizza carts are open 
from 4 pm to 8 pm seven days a week 
wood said he plans to open a 12th cart in july and eventually 
expand his business statewide hes also hoping for a nationwide 
franchise in about 10 years 
i think it would work well in the northern states more so 
than in austin because youre taking it home and youre cooking it 
yourself he said a lot of times austin residents just 
dont want to fire up the oven when its 100 degrees outside 
for now the biggest problem wood seems to face is getting 
people to try his pizza hes had limited success with radio 
television and billboard ads 
the curbside towelthrowing gimmick while cute didnt always 
work especially when the tossers sometimes drop them on the 
pavement 
customers thought we were making them out on the street 
wood said they have a tendency to think we might be making them 
in the back of our garage instead of in a healthapproved 
commissary under the conditions that we have 
we make them fresh every day handmade its the freshest 
product that you can sell to the public 
wood said he solved the mistaken identity problem by bordering 
the phony dough towels in red

a federal appeals court today reinstated a 
potential multibilliondollar lawsuit by the states of california 
arizona oregon and washington that accuses oil companies of 
conspiring to fix prices and contrive a gasoline shortage in the 
early 1970s 
the suit against seven major companies was dismissed in 1986 by 
us district judge william gray of los angeles who said the 
states had failed to present evidence of a conspiracy in violation 
of antitrust laws 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals in a 30 decision 
said today that evidence of information exchanges and parallel 
actions by the companies would allow a jury to find that a 
conspiracy existed 
the ruling if it stands would send the case to trial robert 
mittelstaedt a lawyer for chevron corp said no decision had been 
reached yet on whether to appeal 
expressing surprise at the ruling mittelstaedt said we fully 
expect to win at trial if it comes to that 
the case is separate from another antitrust lawsuit by 
california that accuses six major oil companies of conspiring to 
depress the price of oil they pumped from stateowned tidelands in 
long beach grays dismissal of that suit was also overturned by 
the appeals court and a trial is scheduled for november

coniston partners one of the most prominent 
takeover strategists of the 1980s said friday it is closing up 
shop in response to the shrinking market for mergers and 
acquisitions 
but the three men who led the investor group arent going out of 
business theyre restructuring their operation to reflect the 
changing times 
were realistic said paul e tierney jr one of the three 
founding partners of coniston were trying to adapt our 
investment policy to what we believe to be the current market 
environment and we think its changed a lot 
in its heyday conistons biggest targets included gillette co 
allegis corp and tw services inc 
coniston said it was disbanding the 700 million investment pool 
it used to fund its takeover bids and proxy fights because of the 
scarcity of financing and suitable target companies most of the 
money will be returned to conistons investors 
the trio will continue its investment in ual corp the 
successor to allegis and its ownership of tw services the food 
service company whose operations include the dennys restaurant 
chain 
tierney and his partners augustus k oliver and keith r 
gollust said they would secure financing for future deals on a 
casebycase basis 
disbanding coniston relieves the partners of their 
responsibilities to investors which have become more difficult to 
fulfill with the changes in the takeover market tierney said 
he noted coniston had a 40 percent rate of return before the 
general partners interests were subtracted a very difficult 
rate of return to achieve and sustain with the way the market is 
going 
the trio plans to continue looking for acquisitions but may 
move into areas such as real estate and foreign companies where 
they have not been heavily invested tierney said in an interview 
they will also look for companies in bankruptcy or financial 
distress that need investors and will be involved in arbitrage 
the practice of selling a security in one market and buying it for 
less in another market to profit from the price difference 
the demise of coniston marks the latest retreat of the 1980s 
corporate raiders following the collapse of the junk bond market 
last fall the failure of the 67 billion buyout of federated 
department stores inc by campeau corp last september slowed 
takeover financing to a crawl and brought the merger boom to an end 
coincidentally another big investor group shamrock holdings 
inc also is shifting away from takeovers toward a different kind 
of venture shamrock which failed in a 1988 hostile bid for 
polaroid corp said it is forming a fund to help bail out 
companies that are faltering under heavy debt loads 
news that coniston was closing came on the same day that philip 
morris cos announced it would acquire the swiss coffee and 
chocolate company jacobs suchard ag in a 38 billion deal but 
theres no irony in that 
the deals being done these days including the suchard 
acquisition tend to be strategic moves by companies looking for 
expansion in a related industry that was not the case with 
takeover strategists or corporate raiders like coniston who 
generally were investors seeking profits on their stock holdings 
tierney oliver and gollust all ivy league graduates formed 
coniston in 1982 as the takeover boom was awakening the 
partnership typically took a large stake in a target firm and 
pressured management to take actions to increase the price of the 
companys stock 
one of its biggest successes came in 1987 at allegis the parent 
of united airlines the hertz car rental company and two hotel 
chains 
armed with a 13 percent stake in the company coniston 
threatened a proxy fight and forced the allegis board to fire 
chairman richard j ferris and shed all its assets except for 
united airlines coniston came away with a 175 million profit 
allegis changed its name to ual corp and the companys 
management eventually found itself again tussling with coniston 
the partnership is currently participating in a 438 billion plan 
by united airlines employees to take ual private 
in 1988 coniston lost a proxy fight for four seats on 
gillettes board the partnership and the company later reached an 
agreement under which gillette bought back 16 million of its 
shares giving coniston a profit at least on paper 
last year after a protracted fight coniston won control of tw 
services

minneapolisbased first bank systems 
inc on thursday terminated its planned acquisition of banks of 
iowa inc iowas biggest bank holding company breaking off an 
8year engagement 
the courtship of des moinesbased banks of iowa by first bank 
had been at the center of an acrimonious debate over legalizing 
interstate banking in iowa iowas interstate banking law becomes 
effective in 1991 
but holmes foster chairman of banks of iowa told shareholders 
at the companys annual meeting that the deal fell through because 
a weakened financial condition left first bank system unable to 
obtain the necessary regulatory approval for the takeover 
foster said banks of iowa would begin discussions with other 
potential buyers disclosing the institution already has been 
approached by three serious suitors he did not identify the 
prospective purchasers and said there is no assurance any deal 
would be struck 
banks of iowa stock fell 50 cents to 6950 a share in national 
overthecounter trading first bank system fell 25 cents to 1450 
a share on the new york stock exchange 
first bank system has assets of 202 billion and has 32 banks 
and trust companies with more than 140 offices in minnesota 
colorado montana north dakota south dakota washington and 
wisconsin 
banks of iowa has assets of 259 billion with 12 affiliate 
banks and a data processing company in iowa 
under their december 1981 deal first bank agreed to pay 15 
times banks of iowas book value at the time the interstate banking 
law passed 
at the time first bank also bought 550000 shares of banks of 
iowa stock from a minority shareholder 
under the breakup agreement banks of iowa will buy back the 
550000 shares for nearly 38 million or 69 a share pending 
regulatory approval 
first bank system said it expected a net gain of about 95 
million on the sale of its stock and said the proceeds would be 
credited to a previously established reserve for its financial 
restructuring 
the takeover agreement had been contingent on the approval of a 
law to allow interstate ownership and operation of banks 
minnesota authorized such deals in 1986 this year after years 
of bitter legislative battles iowa passed an interstate banking 
law that will take effect at the beginning of 1991 the iowa law 
allows interstate banking with institutions in adjoining states 
but before the deal became legal first bank system ran into 
financial difficulties 
two years ago first bank system reported a 317 million loss as 
a result of a 497 million pretax loss on the sale of securities 
in 1989 the company encountered loan problems 
foster told the shareholders meeting in des moines that even 
though first bank system recently raised 175 million of new 
equity neither company believed the federal reserve would allow 
completion of the deal or any other such transaction between the 
two either now or in the foreseeable future 
foster said the termination of the agreement will permit banks 
of iowa to pursue other deals with the help of the chicago corp 
an investment banking firm

a securities industry group on thursday

the administration and the sec said the index futures measure is 
necessary to best regulate the securities which some critics hold 
responsible for sharp rises and drops in market prices 
the proposal also would give the sec authority to oversee stock 
index futures margins the down payment required of investors who 
buy the securities on credit 
the commodity futures exchanges currently set those margins 
which are generally much lower than those for securities the sec 
and treasury have said low stock index futures margins partly were 
to blame for the 1987 stock market crash and the 190point market 
drop last october 
stock index futures allow investors to speculate on movements in 
the stock market without buying the underlying stock 
the administration proposal strongly opposed by the futures 
industry and the cftc was introduced as a separate bill in the 
house but will be included in cftc market reform legislation which 
has been pending since last fall

pork belly futures which have taken a severe beating in the 
past two weeks are expected to fall even further after a 
government report friday showed a greater supply than the market 
had expected 
but analysts said the report would quickly be overshadowed by 
the agriculture departments quarterly hogs and pigs tally which 
is due out next friday 
in trading friday on the chicago mercantile exchange frozen 
pork belly futures fell the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a 
pound for the fifth time in the last seven trading sessions 
on other commodity markets energy futures rose grains and 
soybeans were lower orange juice advanced and precious metals 
retreated 
frozen pork bellies settled 95 cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 5940 cents a pound the first 
close below 60 cents since april 18 
in livestock trading hog futures ended 15 cent lower to 78 
cent higher with august at 5795 cents a pound live cattle were 
30 cent to 78 cent lower with august at 7327 cents a pound 
feeder cattle were 20 cent to 67 cent lower with august at 8475 
cents a pound 
a pork belly is the part of a hog from which bacon is made 
slack demand for pork has weighed heavily on hog and belly 
futures for the last two weeks and the usdas monthly coldstorage 
report friday offered no support 
the report which was released after the close showed 1055 
million pounds of bellies in the nations commercial freezers as of 
may 31 nearly 3 million pounds above market expectations 
the number was 26 percent below the yearago level and about 7 
percent higher than the 10year average said charles levitt 
senior livestock analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
chicago 
analysts predicted another limit drop in belly futures monday 
but said traders are likely to then turn their attention to the 
upcoming hogsandpigs report 
the big things coming down the pike a week from today said 
analyst dale durchholz of agrivisor services inc in bloomington 
ill 
levitt estimated the report will show a 1 percent decline in the 
us hog herd since last year but he said it also likely will show 
an increase in farrowing intentions meaning that beginning this 
summer the number of hogs being born will be larger than a year ago 
that is more negative to the longer term situation in the 
market than anything a monthly coldstorage report could show 
levitt said 
crude oil futures made their strongest advance since june 12 on 
the new york mercantile exchange boosted by technical factors 
once the august crude contract pushed above the 1730abarrel 
barrier the market just jerked higher said analyst james 
steel at refco inc 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 25 cents to 52 cents 
higher with august at 1746 a barrel heating oil was 75 cent to 
99 cent higher with july at 4866 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 40 cent to 135 cents higher with july at 6137 cents 
a gallon 
crop futures fell moderately on the chicago board of trade as 
forecasts for beneficial dry weather in the midwest prompted 
profittaking after strong gains during the week 
wheat futures settled 4 cents lower to cent higher with july 
at 333 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents lower with july 
at 282 a bushel oats were 5 cents to 6 cents lower with july at

45 cent to 475 cents higher with july at 1839 a pound 
precious metals were little changed on new yorks commodity

an arrogant young commodities broker devised 
the perfect scam to skim customer profits a prosecutor said 
friday as the first case in a sweeping probe of the worlds largest 
commodities exchanges went to the jury 
robert mosky 34 facing fraud and racketeering charges 
regularly and illegally circumvented the rules of trade at the 
chicago mercantile exchanges swiss franc futures pit assistant 
us attorney james p fleissner said during closing arguments 
jurors were unable to reach a verdict after deliberating two 
hours friday afternoon they will resume at 1030 am edt monday 
mosky and two other traders in the swiss franc pit danny scheck 
and david zatz were the first to stand trial in a lengthy fbi 
investigation of corruption at the mercantile exchange and the 
chicago board of trade 
in all 48 people have been indicted and 16 already have pleaded 
guilty 
mosky was alleged by prosecutors to be the ringleader of a group 
of traders who routinely stole money from customers by trading 
schemes that prevented customer orders from being executed in the 
open market 
its the perfect scam fleissner told jurors who heard 
testimony in us district judge ann c williams courtroom for 
more than six weeks you can do it and you cant get caught 
mosky scheck and zatz were charged last august with more than a 
dozen counts each of mail or wire fraud and violations of the 
commodity exchange act each count carries a maximum penalty of 
five years in prison and a 150000 fine 
mosky also was charged with racketeering conspiracy which 
carries a maximum prison term of 20 years he also could be forced 
to forfeit personal assets 
the government alleged that the three men executed customer 
orders through prearranged or offmarket trades instead of through 
open outcry 
by doing so prosecutors said customers were denied the 
superior prices that would result from open competitive trading 
the defendants were accused of shifting their personal losses 
from trading errors into their customers accounts then hiding 
their practices by changing or destroying trading records 
during closing arguments fleissner argued mosky was arrogant 
and greedy 
once the undercover probe of the exchanges was revealed in 
january 1989 fleissner said mosky told a colleague prosecution 
tape recordings were probably worthless and bragged if no one 
talks theyve got no tapes 
but in closing arguments thursday moskys attorney elliot 
samuels said his client had been scapegoated by overeager 
prosecutors trying to enforce ambiguous commodities trading rules 
if theyre not happy with the damn rules let them go to 
washington and get congress to change it but dont put bob mosky 
in jail because of it samuels said 
his concluding remarks differed considerably from those made by 
the attorneys of scheck and zatz who instead attacked the 
credibility of government witnesses including that of fbi agent 
randall jannett who posed undercover as a corrupt trader 
but fleissner said jannett was no bumpkin 
did agent jannett make mistakes fleissner asked 
rhetorically there were mistakes 
but you go back and count those mistakes up see how far you 
get on your second hand he instructed the jury

a syndicate of banks friday began to soften its 
opposition to a 65 million loan and restructuring plan that would 
help donald trump avert default on a casino bond issue 
however a final agreement on the plan which would suspend some 
payments on bank loans in return for equity in some of trumps 
properties still had not been reached 
a group of four banks three japanese and one german 
institution with a combined 75 million loan to trump secured by 
trump tower had opposed the restructuring because it would put a 
new lien on the fifth avenue skyscraper 
the four banks are sumitomo bank mitsubishi bank and daiichi 
kangyo bank of japan and the dresdner bank of germany they 
reportedly dont like the idea of someone else having a claim to 
property that secures their loans 
on friday some of the japanese banks began to acquiesce said a 
banking source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the foreign banks are tied into a large network of lenders to 
trump led by citibank chase manhattan bankers trust and 
manufacturers hanover that pressed trump to restructure his 
finances after he asked for a fresh loan to cover the bond payment 
the payment was due last week on bonds issued to finance the 
trump castle hotel and casino in atlantic city nj under a grace 
period he has until midnight tuesday to make the 43 million 
payment 
trump issued a statement friday afternoon confirming there had 
been progress 
an overwhelming number of participating lenders representing 
both national and international financial institutions have now 
joined the major banks in supporting our plan trump said in a 
prepared statement 
i am confident that the handful of remaining banks will choose 
to join us to get this restructuring deal put together he said 
trump has until midnight tuesday to finalize the plan or the 
banks could move to seize his assets a 10day grace period started 
after he failed to make the initial june 15 midnight due date 
if he defaults bankruptcy court could become the most 
attractive building in manhattan to the struggling 
developerfailing to make the payment on the trump castle bonds 
could trigger defaults on bank loans secured by other properties 
that could be seized said analysts 
if faced with seizure by his bank lenders whom he owes about 2 
billion bankruptcy court could provide trump with time to avoid a 
foreclosure and get a better price by selling assets in an orderly 
fashion 
he could risk losing everything now or retain things to 
sell under bankruptcy one analyst said 
if the banks took a property they could get a bargain if the 
market value of the property exceeds the balance of outstanding 
loans against it analysts said 
there is some risk for the banks who may not want to take on 
real estate in the slumping new york market they may fare better 
by loaning trump enough money to get him through his cash crisis 
and look at selling properties when manhattan real estate prices 
recover 
while it is possible trump would take all his properties into 
bankruptcy court it is more likely that he would only need to 
protect those to which the banks could lay claim 
the bond obligations on trumps two other atlantic city 
hotelcasinos the trump plaza and the taj mahal protect them from 
defaulting dominostyle after a trump castle default 
however the terms of the bank loans are not public like bond 
agreements so there is no way of knowing for certain which have 
the commonlyused crossdefault clauses 
even if the foreign bank problem is solved paperwork on the 
compex deal probably couldnt be completed before the deadline one 
individual involved in the talks said if all sides agree to the 
restructuring and loan it is likely a shortterm loan could be 
arranged to help him make his payment the individual said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
trump cannot negotiate an extension of the bond payment 
deadline said paul levine spokesman for first fidelity bank in 
newark nj trustee for the bonds the language in the bond 
agreements allows for no extension after the 10day grace period 
he said 
trump has raised some cash through asset sales recently on 
thursday he announced he sold a shipyard near amsterdam in the 
netherlands new york newsday reported last month that he paid 5 
million for the shipyard to make sure work was completed on a 
420foot yacht being built for him 
through a spokesman trump said he made a substantial profit on 
the sale but would not disclose the price

honeywell inc said friday it will drop its 
weekold campaign to halt imports of autofocus cameras made by 
minolta camera co 
honeywell said it was withdrawing its complaint before the 
international trade commission because an expedited trial date of 
sept 3 1991 was set in a corresponding civil suit 
but minolta the japanese cameramaker said honeywell withdrew 
its itc action because it is bound under contract to settle the 
dispute in court 
honeywells autofocus patent infringement lawsuit has been 
pending for more than three years when honeywell announced june 14 
it was asking the itc to ban imports on minolta maxxum cameras and 
other models the company said a trial was two years away 
honeywell said it was calling for the import ban in hopes of 
getting quicker relief the minneapolisbased company said it is 
unjustly losing millions of dollars in royalties while the case is 
being litigated 
the lawsuit accuses minolta of infringing on four honeywell 
patents the itc action sought to ban imports of maxxum cameras and 
others including aftele and freedom dual models 
honeywell contends that minolta breached a 1979 contract calling 
for honeywell to share patented technology and trade secrets 
minolta was restricted to using only honeywellmade autofocus 
modules under the contract honeywell said 
instead honeywell alleges minolta used honeywell autofocus 
technology while developing a module of its own 
minolta said honeywells patent claims are invalid and 
unenforceable the japanese company said its own autofocus 
innovation dates to the 1960s and is well documented by many us 
patents 
the suit seeks unspecified damages and a sales injunction 
honeywells filing with the itc was in clear violation of a 
prior court order minolta spokesman michael gross said their 
withdrawal was solely to avoid the consequences of this violation 
gross said a court hearing had been set for monday in us 
district court in newark nj to challenge the itc filing he 
said honeywell ran the risk of being formally ordered by the 
court to withdraw 
christopher j steffen honeywell vice president and chief 
financial officer said the company was dropping its itc action 
because it was very pleased that our case has been accelerated by 
more than one year 
the fixed trial date will end minoltas continued efforts to 
delay the court case and will produce a decision in the same time 
frame as the itc action steffen said 
but gross said it was honeywells legal maneuvering that 
prompted delays in the case he said the september trial date came 
as no surprise to minolta 
were very happy with the trial date gross said we 
welcome honeywells decision to drop its itc complaint and abide by 
its 1988 agreement to adjudicate this case in the federal court

shamrock holdings the private investment 
company headed by walt disneys nephew roy disney has formed a 
partnership to bail out companies overburdened by debt shamrocks 
chief strategist said friday 
the 450 million fund raised money primarily from previous 
investors in shamrock the company that last year failed to acquire 
polaroid corp after a long highly publicized bid 
several such funds have emerged recently with the intent of 
rescuing companies that overleveraged themselves during the 
borrowing frenzy of the 1980s 
its all youre going to be seeing for the next two years 
shamrocks chief executive stanley p gold said in a telephone 
interview 
shamrocks fund trefoil capital partners is allowed to attempt 
hostile takeovers under the terms of the partnership however it 
is expected to concentrate on friendly white knight deals 
shamrock takes a 1 percent fee for managing the partnership 
a white knight is a third party that often acquires a stake in a 
company to help a takeover target avoid an unfriendly merger 
we want to do three or four deals gold said about 150 
million to 250 million is the ideal 
the partnership already has offered to provide capital for 
struggling companies including southland corp and ames department 
stores both filed for protection from creditors in us bankruptcy 
court 
shamrock also was interested in investing in koor inc israels 
biggest conglomerate which is struggling to service a 12 billion 
debt that offer basically a restructuring in which creditors 
would forgive some koor debt is typical of those trefoil will 
make gold said 
trefoil said it would buy a stake in koor with 100 million of 
new equity if the banks and bondholders would forgive half of their 
12 billion in koor debt no deal has been worked out yet 
theyre trying to restructure their debt gold said they 
may come back to us after they make some progress 
at a time when junk bond and bank financing for big investors is 
hard to come by the fund will provide shamrock with a ready source 
of funds so it can move fast if it spots an attractive deal 
gold said the partnership expects to complete its first deal by 
the end of the year 
shamrock owns the music plus music and video stores in southern 
california and the sound warehouse chain in texas it also owns 15 
radio and three television stations 15 percent of oil field 
equipment maker enterra corp and has various real estate holdings 
trefoil is looking into deals in similar industries officials
