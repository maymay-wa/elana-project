when patricia morison first met cole porter in 
1947 she sang a rodgers and hammerstein song for him 
i thought it was safer she says with a laugh porter must 
have liked what he heard from the young actress who at the time was 
not known as a singer 
he gave me the score for something called kiss me kate and 
told me to learn it miss morison recalls he was having a 
difficult time raising the money for the show it took over a 
year 
the wait was worth it kiss me kate turned out to be 
porters biggest musical success and gave miss morison the 
opportunity to play the temperamental lili vanessi and sing such 
songs as wunderbar and so in love 
forty years later she will sing those songs again in new york 
at a cabaret for cole one of the opening attractions of the 
first new york international festival of the arts the onenight 
concert will be held sunday at town hall 
broadway has always been my first love says miss morison 
who now lives in california you never lose that once youve 
tasted it 
one of the women who turned down a role in kiss me kate 
will also be on hand for the sunday songfest mary martin will sing 
another porter song my heart belongs to daddy from leave it 
to me a number she first sang on broadway 50 years ago the show 
was miss martins broadway debut and the song a coy striptease 
number made her a star 
these two legendary women are not the only attractions at a 
cabaret for cole the other singers doing the songs of cole 
porter also have impeccable credentials they include karen akers 
kaye ballard barbara cook michael feinstein hildegarde sylvia 
syms margaret whiting and julie wilson 
the concert is a benefit for the mabel mercer foundation which 
was founded after miss mercers death in 1984 to widen the audience 
for cabaret the singer was generally considered to be the supreme 
cabaret artist known for her ability to interpret a songs 
emotional sense 
from the late 1930s until the late 1970s she sang in several 
new york nightclubs including le ruban bleu and tonys as well as 
at the st regis hotel 
porter was a great friend of miss mercer he thought her 
rendition of just one of those things was the best version ever 
done 
for miss morison the chance to appear in kiss me kate 40 
years ago was a dream come true to do it she needed to get out of 
a commitment to appear in what was a new line of work for actors in 
1947 a tv series 
i think it was called the cases of eddie drake miss 
morison says i played a lady psychiatrist to whom the detective 
came and told his stories lying on the couch 
miss morison did get to new york after the producer shot all her 
13 segments on the television show in a quick twoweek period and 
she agreed to publicize the series 
cole was a wonderful friend miss morison says he had an 
essential musicality plus there was the elegance of his lyrics 
i just saw a concert version of jubilee which is where 
begin the beguine came from that was done in 1935 even with all 
the topical and in jokes of the period about dorothy parker and 
elsa maxwell and noel coward and others the young audience 
watching it got everything cole never seems to really date

experts investigating why the sphinx 
is crumbling say the culprit is sewage from a tacky tourist village 
and a hotel favored by the rich and famous 
cries of alarm were raised in early february after a chunk of 
limestone fell from the 4500yearold statues right shoulder 
suddenly salt oozing through the limestone statue and previously 
ignored cracks in its pharaohs face and lions body were seen as 
evidence the monument was near collapse 
a committee of specialists from egypt france west germany and 
italy probed scraped and tested the stone for four months to see 
what is happening to one of the worlds bestknown ancient 
monuments 
the answer is quickened decay and the reason is sewage said 
zahi hawass an egyptologist and director general of the pyramids 
area where the sphinx has crouched since the old kingdom 
hawass blamed sewage water flowing freely from the nearby 
tourist village of nazlet alsamman and an inadequate sewage system 
at the wellknown mena house hotel 
once a sleepy town at the edge of the desert nazlet alsamman 
has mushroomed in the last 20 years with an injection of funds 
earned by locals in the persian gulf oil countries the town boasts 
an eversprouting array of tourist shops selling pharaonic 
bricabrac with names like moses place pharaohs perfume 
factory and cleos bazaar 
just to the northwest the mena house was built in 1868 to house 
dignitaries assembled for the opening of the suez canal 
the stately hotels reputation grew over the decades as it 
hosted charlie chaplin british field marshal bernard montgomery 
presidents franklin d roosevelt and jimmy carter winston 
churchill and others in 1974 400 rooms were added to the original 
150 
hawass said no sewage system was installed to meet the needs of 
the bustling village and the hotels system was inadequate for its 
expanded size thus excess waste water entered the water table and 
undermined the sphinx 
before the recent study hawass said it was assumed the statue 
was deteriorating due to changes in the underground water table 
caused by the aswan high dams regulation of the nile rivers flow 
now that the cause of the damage is determined he said work 
will begin on repairing it 
egyptian experts are being joined by others from west germany 
britain and the university of louisville in the united states to 
formulate a longterm savethesphinx plan 
the government already has allocated 23 million for a new 
sewage system aimed at halting the dirtywater flow beneath and 
around the sphinx hawass said 
a committee set up to oversee repairs met thursday and approved 
plans to have a masonry support of limestone blocks laid just below 
where the chunk of rock fell in february then to replace the rock 
on july 9 
hawass said restoration work in recent years especially an 
effort that began in 1982 and was stopped when the latest piece 
fell did not match ancient attempts to protect the monument the 
first on record was a patchup campaign that began 1000 years 
after the sphinx was created about 2500 bc 
hawass said cement used to secure loose rocks after 1982 had 
turned the limestone to powder the cement didnt allow the rocks 
to breathe now were removing all the cement and testing gypsum 
mixed with rocks from giza plateau itself to see if the mix cant 
protect sensitive areas 
the team of local and foreign experts also is to study the 
effects on the sphinx of cairos air pollution which on most days 
can be seen from giza hovering in layers over the city of 12 
million 
next to the cheops pyramid the sphinx is the most popular among 
egypts thousands of monuments but as egyptians laugh at many of 
the modern worlds tribulations they have chuckled at the sphinxs 
sewage problem through newspaper cartoons 
in one cartoon the sphinx has lost his everpresent subtle 
smile he says i dont care whether they call it waste water or 
sewage runoff this stuff stinks 
in another pharaohs cheops chephren and mycerinus builders of 
the worlds three most famous pyramids on the plateau behind the 
sphinx stand before an immigration officer obviously ready to 
leave town 
we dont care what country you choose one pharoah says 
as long as it has a sewage system

in a subdued setting of marble and etched glass 
bettors on saturdays 120th running of the belmont stakes will drop 
thousands of dollars while dining on the likes of caesar salad or 
lobster tails 
its called upscale wagering and new yorks offtrack betting 
corp is counting on this as the course of its future 
the restaurant in manhattans wall street financial district 
with its thick carpeting brass rails and maroon and sportinggreen 
decor is one of two opened within the last two years by otb in the 
city scattered through its rooms are 11 betting windows for 
parimutuel wagers at track odds and several huge screens for 
watching races 
the restaurant skyward the select club also has an overhead 
stockprice ticker for wall street watchers and a 5 cover charge 
the steep prices lobster tails for lunch are 2195 or at 
least the ambiance that comes with them are intended to attract 
highrollers and it seems they do 
were consistently breaking 1000 per capita daily easily 
north american records other people say theres nothing 
comparable otb spokeswoman barbara thompson said of the two 
restaurants each exceeds the 1000 mark at least five or six 
times a month she said compared to an average of 20 to 30 per 
bettor at other otb offices 
the upscale sites also are moneymakers in total take only about 
the five busiest parlors in the city ever go over 100000 a day 
and thompson said the restaurants consistently do 
otb parlors legal in the city since 1971 tend to be scruffy 
single rooms containing little more than betting windows with no 
seating food service or toilet facilities with the floors 
littered by the debris of losing finishes the citys stable of 104 
standardissue otbs are hardly places to encourage the fastidious 
to hang around and keep betting 
but with the 1986 opening of its first restaurant inside track 
on the upper east side otb toned its image 
whether otb is really attracting a new breed of bettor or is 
simply making life more pleasant for damon runyon characters of the 
1980s is hard to tell 
a glance around the select club reveals few apparent tourists or 
others unschooled in the ways of picking a daily double 
for the conservative 2 bettor a novice to the nuances between 
a quinella and an exacta bet the place has the hush and the aura 
of serious business few murmur much less cheer even as horses 
head for the finish many bettors do not dine but sit hunched up 
in easy chairs circled in front of the large screen at the end of 
the main dining room 
the 5 entrance fee doesnt apply to bettors who have a platinum 
card that is customers who keep a minimum of 1000 in an otb 
escrow account the betting corporation also takes telephone bets 
and accepts credit cards from established patrons 
a regular who would identify himself only as keith said hes at 
the select club every day until 4 pm when hes due at work 
nearby he carried a stack of punchcards he said he uses to 
handicap the horses 
the history of every horse that races in this state is on 
these cards he said shuffling the deck 
when he was spotted there after 5 pm and asked why he wasnt 
at work he said hed come in to cash a winning ticket for his boss 
keith said there was a mob at the restaurant for the kentucky 
derby and he expects the same saturday actually otb figures 
indicate that those who show up for highprofile races dilute the 
take on the saturday before the derby paid admissions were 97 and 
the per capita bet was 999 the 250 people on derby day may 7 
dropped the average to 650 
in new york the first of four states to legalize offtrack 
betting the citys otb has contributed 18 billion to city 
state local governments and the racing industry from 1971 through 
fiscal 1987 
otb president howard p giordano said that in the city where 
the odds are high against finding low rents otb will continue to 
upgrade its parlors just as fast as real estate will let us

little league slugger mike curran has 
hit six homeruns in his last 10 games now none of the opposing 
teams will pitch to him raising questions of lessthanadult 
sportsmanship his coaches say 
curran 12 has a batting average of 888 and plays for the 
leagues top team the orioles harvey katzen one of currans 
coaches says the decision by the leagues other coaches to 
consistently walk the hot hitter fails to set a good example for 
the players curran has been walked 12 times in his last four games 
what are you teaching the kids when they encounter a 
difficult situation in life they should avoid it katzen said 
currans father james p curran said the general decision to 
keep walking his son is unfair 
the little league should be for the kids not the managers 
he said hes being punished because he is good 
the middlesex news reported thursday that the opposing coaches 
have continued to intentionally walk the slugger despite a 
leaguewide advisory issued last week discouraging use of the 
tactic 
but the young player is taking it in stride 
when they walk me i just think about getting them back when i 
pitch he said its a joke really 
curran has pitched two nohitters this season

usa today founder allen neuharth the 
chairman of gannett corp says he cares about sea turtles its 
the sea turtle protection society he could do without 
society members patrol beaches nightly here in allterrain 
vehicles searching for turtle poachers and bright lights that can 
disorient nesting turtles 
two weeks ago the society complained to police that lights at 
neuharths oceanfront estate here were too bright under a city 
ordinance that regulates beach lighting 
a police officer knocked on the newspaper magnates door after 
midnight with two society members cocoa beach city manager jim 
smith said 
neuharth told the officer that his lights did not violate the 
ordinance because they were specially designed to direct the light 
inland he later complained about the intrusion to cocoa beach 
mayor bob lawton in a threepage letter 
i strenuously object to this middleofthenight harassment 
neuharth wrote i happen to agree with sea turtle supporters that 
we should do anything within reason to encourage their nesting and 
hatching but i also know as im sure you do that sea turtle 
soapboxers are like all other specialinterest pressure groups 
they get carried away with their causes 
neuharth also threatened to sue the city if there is any 
recurrence 
smith later told the society it could not use its vehicles on 
the beach because it did not have a special permit 
the society said it will no longer try to enforce the lighting 
ordinance because the citys sixmile stretch of beach is too long 
for volunteers to patrol each night on foot

a house subcommittee is recommending 
continuation of bans on federal oil lease sales off the coasts of 
california and new england and renewal of one covering part of 
floridas coast 
the stance was taken wednesday by the appropriations interior 
subcommittee as it gave voicevote approval to a 97 billion 
spending package for the interior department and the us forest 
service for the year beginning oct 1 
the legislation would continue the bans that congress has been 
placing yearly on leasing oil and gas tracts in northern california 
and along the georges bank in the atlantic 
it would also reinstate a leasing ban for southwest florida 
waters that had been imposed by congress through september 1987 
chairman sidney yates dill said he thought the proposed 
bans lasting through sept 30 1989 would be endorsed by the full 
committee at a vote scheduled for next week 
the subcommittee bill giving the department 400 million more 
than it is receiving this year would boost spending by the 
national park service to 950 million an increase of 50 million 
over current levels 
the legislation would provide 170 million to acquire land for 
wildlife refuges and other openspace uses that is more than 10 
times the 15 million requested by the reagan administration 
under the spending plan the us forest service would get 18 
billion a 100 million increase construction of logging roads 
would be set at 166 million down from the current 196 million 
for the second straight year the tongass national forest in 
alaska would get less than the 50 million annual appropriation it 
is supposed to receive under a temporarily suspended federal law 
the huge forest which conservationists say is being 
overharvested by commercial timbering would get 31 million 12 
million below this years level and 22 million under what the 
administration sought for fiscal 1989

new york investment banker nicholas brady who 
has often served as an outside consultant to the reagan 
administration may soon be joining the administration as the next 
treasury secretary 
administration sources said wednesday that brady is on a short 
list of candidates to succeed treasury secretary james a baker 
iii who is expected to resign this summer to oversee vice 
president george bushs generalelection campaign 
these sources who spoke on condition that their names not be 
used said that brady was the leading candidate they said other 
officials being considered are deputy secretary of state john 
whitehead and treasury undersecretary george gould 
publicly all sides were saying that baker has made no decision 
to step down but sources said that the decision was very close to 
being made and the white house had begun reviewing possible 
successors 
brady the cochairman of the wall street investment firm of 
dillon read amp co is close friends of both bush and baker and 
because of these ties the administration has used him in a 
succession of advisory positions 
he headed the administration task force which investigated the 
causes of last octobers stock market crash although his final 
report which called for tighter regulations of financial markets 
displeased the administrations freemarket advocates 
in addition to leading the brady commission brady has served at 
the presidents request on the packard commission that studied 
defense reforms the scowcroft commission that studied mx missile 
deployment and the kissinger commission that studied us policy 
in central america 
one source said the ultimate choice was likely to wind up 
between brady and whitehead because gould while highly respected 
for the job he has done on banking issues does not have the 
necessary international experience for the top spot 
in addition gould holds the no 3 job at treasury and his 
elevation to the top spot would be seen as a slap at deputy 
treasury secretary m peter mcpherson the no 2 official 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
insisted that the administration did not have any candidate list 
because no vacancy exists but the wall street journal reported 
wednesday that the selection of brady was being discussed at the 
highest echelons of the administration 
the choice of brady would likely be well received in domestic 
and international financial markets in part because of his 
longtime ties with both bush and baker 
the markets which are still jittery after the october collapse 
would likely view brady as someone brought in to continue the 
approach started by baker who has won high praise for his handling 
of economic issues 
sources said they believe baker will step aside as treasury 
secretary sometime around the aug 1518 republican convention to 
run bushs campaign a belief that has intensified in recent weeks 
as the bush camp has been beset by internal staff dissension and 
the candidates plunge in the polls behind democrat michael dukakis 
baker has denied he has decided to leave his post to join the 
bush campaign saying as recently as sunday that there is no 
agreement no arrangement no deal 
but baker has also been saying recently that he would respect 
the wishes of the president and vice president on his future 
brady refused to comment on the speculation saying ive 
heard the rumor a hundred times im very happy at dillon read and 
i intend to stay here im not going to speculate about a 
hypothetical comment 
brady served briefly in the senate in 1982 when he filled out 
the term of former sen harrison williams of new jersey who was 
convicted of bribery and corruption in the 1980 abscam scandal 
brady had been viewed as the frontrunning candidate to serve as 
treasury secretary in a bush administration 
his elevation to that job in the reagan administration would 
make sense sources said because as a former senator he could be 
expected to have an easier time winning senate confirmation a 
primary consideration given that only seven months remain in the 
current administration

john glenn says the democrats vice 
presidential nominee should be a national hero a former astronaut 
and a midwesterner with foreign policy experience 
but ive talked to neil armstrong and hes not interested 
joked the ohio senator about the first man to walk on the moon 
it is of course glenn who best fits his own description for 
the second spot on the national ticket with probable nominee 
michael dukakis and many democratic insiders agree that the first 
american to orbit the earth would be a good choice 
hes on everybodys short list and ought to be democratic 
party chief paul kirk told a chicago fundraising audience recently 
as he introduced glenn 
even jesse jacksons campaign manager gerald austin puts glenn 
on his vp list right behind jackson 
its a great american story you take mike dukakis son of 
greek immigrants and john glenn a smalltown boy who married his 
childhood sweetheart a woman who overcame a stuttering problem 
and then glenn goes on to be the worlds most famous astronaut and 
a us senator said austin an ohio political consultant 
and a recent california poll provides another argument for 
glenn who hails from new concord ohio 
dukakis led bush without any mention of a running mate by 13 
points in midmay but with gov george deukmejian on the gop 
ticket it was an even race 
except against dukakis and glenn that democratic ticket bested 
the homestate choice in california by 10 percentage points 
glenns office declined a request for an interview to discuss 
the possibility of the no 2 spot on the ticket 
so why wont dukakis pick glenn who will celebrate his 67th 
birthday on the day the democratic national convention opens in 
atlanta on july 18 
one big reason is 1984 
glenn sought the democratic presidential nomination in 1984 an 
effort that was by even his own account a disaster 
i humiliated my family gained 16 pounds and went over 25 
million in debt outside of that it was a great experience 
glenn said last year in assessing his 1984 performance 
glenn was judged the top opponent to former vice president 
walter mondale for the 1984 nomination but a campaign torn by 
dissention and lackluster performances on the stump by the 
candidate brought a quick end to the bid before spring 
even if the memories of 1984 fade the debt hasnt 
the campaign still owes about 24 million to vendors and to 
four ohio banks more than four years later and much of that time 
has been spent fighting with the federal election commission over 
the legality of the loans that battle was settled last year with a 
promise by the campaign to pay 4000 to the fec 
with dukakis emphasizing his own management of fiscal policy and 
his legendary tightfisted personal habits glenns debt might be a 
problem 
what most americans remember about glenn comes not from 1984 
but from 1962 
that year the marine corps pilot was the first american to orbit 
the earth blasting off from cape canaveral aboard the mercury 
capsule friendship 7 on a journey that moved the nation firmly 
back into the space race 
glenn returned to tickertape parades and the adulation of a 
nation that had been shaken by soviet successes in space 
he returned to ohio to enter politics in his home state but 
success eluded him he failed in senate bids in 1964 and 1970 
before winning a bitterly contested primary against howard 
metzenbaum in 1974 and going on to capitol hill 
the retired marine corps officer has followed a moderately 
liberal course in the senate focusing intensely on one or two 
issues too intensely critics have said but he has been the 
senates expert on efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to 
other countries 
his record on military matters has not been one of unquestioning 
support for the pentagon glenn supported the b1 bomber strongly 
but opposed the mx missile he backed production of binary nerve 
gas weapons but opposed aid to the nicaraguan contras 
through his career he has had moderately high ratings from 
liberal groups such as the americans for democratic action and 
moderately low marks from conservative groups such as the american 
conservative union 
and he argues that such a middle path is the winning choice for 
the party in the general election 
the democratic party should pursue a reasoned and a middle 
course glenn says if our agenda is the nations agenda then 
rankandfile americans will come home to the democratic party i 
believe we can and should be the party of the sensible center

it could be the leadin to a prime time crime 
show with the ratatat of a machine gun and a wailing siren in 
the background a deepvoiced announcer delivers his lines 
pictures of assassination victims flash on the screen 
in fact its an ad for the government of colombia 
for the past week or so stations in new york and washington 
have been showing 15second spots purchased by colombia to 
dramatize its position on the front lines of the global drug war 
and dispel the notion colombians arent fighting the drug lords 
all we ask when you think of colombia dont just think of 
the drug dealers remember the colombian heroes who are dying every 
day the announcer says 
halfpage ads displaying the names of fallen heroes in the war 
against drugs policemen judges government ministers 
journalists and prosecutors killed in colombia have appeared in 
the wall street journal the new york times and the washington post 
rodrigo pardo counselor to colombian president virgilio barco 
said wednesday that the 350000 campaign is an effort to counter 
an impression americans might have that colombia is complacent 
about its reputation as a drug barony 
we want to show it isnt true that we are engaged in a 
struggle he said the ads are a step toward an accurate 
understanding of the situation 
president barco as it turned out had to cancel a us visit to 
promote the campaign because of what might be another battle in the 
drug war the kidnapping of alvara gomez hurtado a leading 
colombian political figure barco stayed home to monitor the crisis 
caused by hurtados abduction 
for years south and central american countries listed as major 
sources of narcotics for the us market have been asserting that 
the reagan administration should stop picking on producing 
countries and do more to stop demand on the streets of america 
standing in for barco at a news conference at the colombian 
embassy foreign minister julio londono stated the view bluntly 
asked if he thought president reagan was doing enough to stop 
drugs londono declared all the information i have received 
shows the consumption of drugs has increased the past few years 
im surprised that when you walk down 42nd street in new york 
people are selling phony watches cocaine and crack and thats 
right under the noses of the police londono said i would hope 
there is sure punishment on a daily basis to those selling in the 
streets 
as for the use of us military forces to stop drugs in 
colombia londono said it would be akin to the colombian police 
going to new york city to help the new york police stop drug 
consumption 
the print ads prepared by the sawyer miller group a new york 
agency handling the campaign suggest that colombia is fighting 
drugs but the united states campaign is all talk 
below a news photo of a funeral cortege presumably for a 
government victim of the drug cartel the ad says in colombia

a pair of congressmen who are working to have 
the first medals of honor awarded to black servicemen who fought in 
the two world wars say theyll take their case to the white house 
if the pentagon cant be swayed 
sgt henry johnson a world war i hero and seaman dorrie 
miller a world war ii hero were among the 137 million black 
americans who fought for the united states during the two world 
wars 
reps joseph dioguardi rny and mickey leland dtexas sent 
a letter wednesday signed by 102 of their colleagues asking defense 
secretary frank c carlucci to clear the way for the medals to be 
awarded both johnson and miller are deceased 
of the 549 medals of honor that were awarded for heroism during 
the two wars not one went to a black serviceman dioguardi said 
the basic issue here is fundamental justice he said at a news 
conference wednesday 
i think the next step at this point is to hope that secretary 
carlucci recognizes this is an oversight he said no matter 
what the secretary does no matter what the army does no matter 
what the navy does we are prepared to go to the white house to get 
these medals issued 
last month army and navy brass wrote to rep les aspin 
dwisc who is chairman of the house armed services committee to 
voice their opposition to legislation that would allow the two 
servicemen to be considered for the medal the army and navy object 
because the statute of limitations for awarding the medals ran out 
long ago 
many medals of honor have been awarded after the fiveyear 
limitations statute has expired the congressmen wrote to 
carlucci we need to correct this as soon as possible 
the legislation introduced last october by dioguardi and 
leland is stalled in the armed services committee for lack of 
pentagon support leland said the bill was unlikely to go anywhere 
without army and navy backing 
we would rather not have a war against the pentagon he said 
at the news conference 
dioguardi also said aides to president reagan told him last week 
that the white house will not put up roadblocks to the bill 
johnson of albany ny served in france during world war i 
one night while on sentry duty he killed four german soldiers 
rescued a wounded comrade and captured a stockpile of weapons 
despite being severely wounded himself he was awarded the croix de 
guerre frances highest military honor 
miller of waco texas was stationed as a mess steward aboard 
the uss virginia when the ship was attacked at pearl harbor when 
his captain was mortally wounded miller dragged him to safety and 
manned a machine gun shooting down two enemy aircraft he was 
awarded the navy cross the services second highest honor a 
warship the uss miller was named in his honor in 1971

hospital corridor police described the slaying as part of an 
underworld feud 
an official of the carabinieri italys paramilitary force said 
a gunman firing an automatic weapon killed francesco stillittano 
34 on wednesday

heart said the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the victim was in polyclinic hospital apparently to visit his 
daughter the official said and was shot in a hallway near an 
entrance 
he said the gunman escaped possible aided by an accomplice and 
that the investigation has been hampered by reluctance of witnesses 
to talk to police 
two years ago stillittano who has been convicted of criminal 
association was leaving his house to go to work in a pastry shop 
when gunmen opened fire stillittano was injured and a railway 
worker who accidentally got into the way was killed the 
carabinieri official said

house rejection of a home health care plan 
buried any chance of action on the proposal this year but 
lawmakers and lobbyists say the next congress is likely to pass an 
even broader program 
it is safe to say that 1989 will be the year that congress 
considers seriously a comprehensive longterm care program said 
ron pollack executive director of villers advocacy associates a 
lobbying group for the lowincome elderly 
the house on wednesday voted 243169 not to consider a longterm 
home health care bill proposed by rep claude pepper dfla 87 
known and revered by senior citizens across the country as a 
champion of their concerns 
pepper won lavish praise from his colleagues and a standing 
ovation after making a tearful appeal for his fiveyear 28 
billion medicare expansion plan but in the end he was defeated by 
a coalition of democrats and republicans who objected not only to 
parts of the bill itself but also to the fact that it never 
underwent committee scrutiny 
the vote was not a vote against the elderly or others in need 
of longterm care said rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman 
of the ways and means committee which has jurisdiction over 
medicare 
rostenkowski said a commission on longterm care needs both at 
home and in nursing homes is scheduled to report to congress in 
six months 
i fully anticipate that the commissions report and 
recommendations will form the starting point for congressional 
action on longterm health care in the next congress irrespective 
of who is the president in november rostenkowski said on the 
floor 
peppers bill would have provided longterm home services to the 
disabled and chronically ill of all ages it would have been 
financed by imposing the medicare payroll tax on income above 
45000 which is currently exempt an estimated 22 million people 
would qualify for the benefit in 1990 
the bill came to the floor without going to rostenkowskis panel 
or the energy and commerce committee chaired by rep john dingell 
dmich as a result of a special arrangement between pepper and 
house speaker jim wright dtexas 
the spurned chairmen put on a lot of heat pepper commented 
after the vote he accused the 99 democrats who voted against him 
of forgetting what the democratic party stands for the 
republicans he said have not changed their stripes 
pepper won the opportunity for a floor vote by agreeing not to 
attach his plan to the catastrophic illness bill that won final 
congressional passage wednesday and was headed for the white house 
house leaders feared it would sink that bill a reagan 
administration initiative designed to help the elderly deal with 
the costs of acute illness 
house republican leader robert michel rill blasted the 
pepper bill as a shallow and costly election year pasteup job 
longterm care should be viewed as a health care problem and not 
a political opportunity he said 
lawmakers of both parties voiced concerns ranging from the cost 
of the bill to its lack of aid to nursing home patients and their 
families 
many said the program promised more than it could deliver 
because the agencies and services it requires do not yet exist 
they questioned opening medicare to all age groups as well as a 
provision requiring congress to cut services and charge 
beneficiaries if as expected the program began to run a deficit 
the congressional budget office estimated the pepper program 
would cost 28 billion over five years and after that the 
medicare tax increase would not be enough to cover it health and 
human services secretary otis r bowen said administration 
calculations indicate the program would rack up a 9 billion 
deficit in 1990 and 26 billion by 2000 
among those fighting the pepper bill was the coordinating 
committee for longterm care policy a coalition of insurance and 
business groups that includes the american council of life 
insurance and the us chamber of commerce 
the chamber praised the house action in a statement issued after 
the vote the group said filling the gaps in longterm care will 
require a partnership between the public and private sectors not 
precipitous action by government alone

education secretary william bennett is 
opposing proposals within the reagan administration to take away 
student loans drivers licenses and public housing from anyone 
convicted of using drugs administration sources say 
the cabinetlevel national drug policy board is considering 
whether to endorse withholding federal aid from state and local 
governments colleges and universities and other publicly financed 
institutions if they dont adopt the antidrug proposals which are 
still in the discussion stage attorney general edwin meese iii 
chairs the policy board 
some of these measures may appear draconian but may be very 
necessary while others may be draconian and may be rejected but 
the point is that somehow some way the american public needs a 
2by4 between the eyes to convince them to stop this insatiable 
appetite for drugs said acting associate attorney general 
francis keating the no 3 official at the justice department 
but bennett is trying to steer the reagan administration away 
from the proposals 
bennett who favors increased use of the military as an 
antidrug measure has expressed doubts that the current proposals 
would be effective administration sources speaking on condition 
of anonymity said wednesday 
a spokesman for the department of education loye miller 
declined to comment on bennetts views 
under current law educational institutions receiving federal 
aid are required to certify that they have drug abuse prevention 
programs the drug policy board is considering support for 
toughening those requirements with specific punishments for drug 
pushers and users while bennett doesnt oppose putting teeth in 
the law he doesnt feel such steps are central to the war on 
drugs said one source 
bennett argued successfully at a policy board meeting may 27 
against one proposal to make anyone ineligible for student aid 
once they are convicted of drug use according to the sources 
at the meeting bennett focused on the broader point as well 
that we should be extremely tough on people who are pushing drugs 
in public housing projects or anywhere else but that we want to 
protect the people living in public housing not putting our weight 
behind proposals that would cut off aid to poor people said one 
source 
if endorsed by the policy board the white house and adopted 
through a combination of legislation and federal regulation the 
proposals would represent an expansion of the administrations 
zero tolerance program under it law enforcement officials are 
seizing cars and boats in which drugs are found no matter how 
small the amount 
policy board members are discussing having student loan 
recipients sign a document stating that being a convicted drug user 
can mean loss of the loan 
they also are discussing making it a federal crime to sell drugs 
near public housing similar to the federal schoolyard law making 
it a federal crime to sell drugs in the vicinity of schools 
another proposal under discussion at the policy board calls for 
state governments to refuse to issue firsttime drivers licenses 
to minors who have been convicted of drug use the federal 
government would enforce this by threatening to withhold federal 
transportation financing

vice president george bush trying to 
recapture lost ground in public opinion polls is revamping his 
campaign tactics and will seek to take the offensive in the weeks 
ahead campaign advisers say 
part of bushs new postprimary strategy will include trying to 
paint democrat michael dukakis as an ultraliberal to the left of 
walter mondale said campaign official ed rogers referring to 
the 1984 democratic presidential candidate 
the guy dukakis is a wimp the guy opposes every major 
weapons system there is he is for the nuclear freeze he is 
against more aircraft carriers he is for pulling troops out of 
south korea hes a sandinista lover hell blast our allies and 
say nothing bad about the sandinistas or castro rogers said 
but other bush advisers and prominent republican leaders 
caution that such attacks could go too far 
you dont become president by only diminishing your opponent 
that in fact enlarges your opponent said rep lynn martin 
rill national cochair of bushs presidential campaign 
john sears a washington lawyer and political consultant who 
managed ronald reagans unsuccessful 1976 presidential bid agreed 
he isnt that far back in the polls to be desperate sears 
said attacks on dukakis at this point could come back in his 
face he should be out there making positive points about what this 
administration has accomplished and not let the agenda be 
constructed by the democrats 
bush changing gears with the tuesdays end of the primary 
season was embarking today on a series of appearances aimed at 
building up party unity and broadening his base of support outside 
the traditional gop constituencies 
the vice president was flying to his adopted hometown of 
houston where he will meet with a group of hispanics and address 
the texas state republican convention 
on friday hell travel to denver for the first in a series of 
what the gop has billed unity 88 conferences bush will be 
joined there by three vanquished republican white house hopefuls 
senate minority leader bob dole rep jack kemp and television 
evangelist pat robertson 
meanwhile reagan on tuesday promised to do everything i can 
to help bush win in november and said bush shouldnt worry about 
his underdog status in the polls 
id say george wait until you and i get out there on the 
trail and start pinning him dukakis down on the things he claims 
which we know are not true reagan said during a 
questionandanswer session with regional reporters 
reagan said bush had a part of everything weve accomplished 
in this administration 
the president appeared unconcerned about recent attempts by bush 
to distance himself from the administrations policies 
in particular reagan was asked to respond to comments the vice 
president made about the soviet union and human rights issues 
which seemed at odds with reagans more positive assessments voiced 
at the moscow summit 
no hes being as careful as we all must be reagan said 
bush advisers said that candidates postprimary strategy will 
focus on dukakis record as governor of massachusetts and will 
stress both his lack of foreign policy experience and his 
opposition to weapons systems 
a republican party official knowledgeable about the bush 
campaigns general election strategy said that bush was unlikely to 
break with reagan over any heavyweight issues such as the 1981 tax 
cuts the easing of government regulation of business or the 
military buildup 
i dont think bush is going to give a stop the bombing 
statement like hubert humphrey when he broke with lyndon johnson 
over vietnam said the official who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
in fact this official said the bush campaign may be spending 
too much time engaging in discussions of the candidates obstacles 
to election this fall there may be too much 
temperaturetaking he said 
bush will be partly constrained in his activities until after he 
formally receives the gop nomination in august by a shortage of 
funds 
the campaign is within just 1 million of the federal 
preconvention 27 million spending limit and had to lay off dozens 
of campaign workers but aides said bush would take advantage of 
other fundraising events including todays texas gop convention 
and fridays unity dinner in denver 
we can raise money for the republican national committee for 
republican candidates for the unity conferences for state 
parties said bush spokesman stephen hart

clarence m pendleton jr the controversial 
former us civil rights commission chairman was eulogized 
wednesday as a tireless advocate of a colorblind society who died 
before seeing his dream achieved 
sadly a strong voice has been silenced but not the words he 
gave us or his powerful thoughts said william bradford reynolds 
assistant us attorney general for the civil rights division 
clarence pendleton was a remarkable leader a man in many ways 
ahead of his time he said 
pendleton 57 died sunday of an apparent heart attack while 
exercising in a san diego health club he was the first black to 
head the nations civil rights commission when president reagan 
appointed him to the post in 1981 
his wife margrit and three children attended the service at 
st pauls episcopal cathedral with more than 500 mourners 
including us attorney general edwin meese iii civil rights 
commissioners and government officials 
he was one of the outstanding leaders of president reagans 
team and he will be missed very much meese said afterwards 
pendletons conservative views such as his frequent reference 
to programs that specially benefitted minorities as the new 
racism angered some congressional members and civil right 
leaders 
but reynolds praised pendleton in his eulogy for daring to 
challenge conventional ideas advocating racial equality through 
affirmative action quotas and similar programs 
the road penny traveled was not smooth or easy and 
integrity was his middle name reynolds said he held to his 
beliefs tenaciously and was not afraid to stand alone 
pendletons wife and 9yearold daughter paula each placed a 
red rose on top of his coffin as six pallbearers including san 
diego police chief bill kolender wheeled it to the hearse after 
the funeral service ended 
reynolds whom pendleton counted among his best friends along 
with meese said the former head of the san diego urban league 
shared the dream of a society without racial prejudice just as 
fervently and just as fully as slain civil rights leader the 
rev martin luther king jr 
pendletons body will be cremated and his ashes buried at 
lincoln memorial cemetary during a yetunscheduled private 
interment civil rights commission spokesman john eastman said 
a public memorial service in washington dc is planned 
sometime within the next two weeks he said

new york gov mario cuomo finally endorsed 
michael dukakis for the democratic presidential nomination but 
insists his support was never relevant 
in the early stages of the campaign many democrats had hoped 
that cuomo might emerge as the nominee cuomo repeatedly said he 
wasnt running but refused to flatly rule out a draft until less 
than two months ago 
cuomo gave his backing to dukakis on wednesday a day after the 
massachusetts governor wrapped up the nomination in the final four 
primaries of the season 
cuomos public endorsement of dukakis came only after prodding 
by reporters at the governors news conference when cuomo revealed 
that he had talked to dukakis on wednesday morning reporters asked 
about an endorsement and cuomo brushed the question aside 
for months i said i was for whoever comes out of the primary 
process first so that was a fait accompli as soon as the 
primaries were over said cuomo 
pressed on the point he said its an empty question my 
endorsement was never relevant 
why cant you bring yourself to say that you endorse him 
one reporter finally asked 
i endorse him i endorse him i endorse him cuomo burst out 
in response there three times i endorsed him

agriculture department economists are 
forecasting an additional 1 billion in farm exports over 
februarys estimate for the current year raising the total amount 
to 335 billion 
the volume of exports also should increase by 3 million tons to 
1455 million usda said wednesday in a report on the outlook for 
farm exports 
it said the rise in value chiefly reflects greater shipments of 
animal and horticultural products as well as soybeans 
tonnage increased was primarily attributed to additional 
shipments of wheat feed ingredients and soybeans 
the forcast was for an increase of 16 million tons and 56 
billion over the export levels for last year 
animal products in this case mainly those derived from 
livestock were estimated to be in for a 600 million increase to a 
record 56 billion an increase of 12 percent stronger demand 
overseas is bringing higher prices for red meats animal fats 
hides and skins the report said 
meanwhile usda economists said imports would climb 500 million 
from februarys estimate to 21 billion they said the nations 
surplus in agricultural trade most likely would reach 125 billion 
wheat and flour exports are being estimated at 402 million 
tons an increase of 12 million tons or 3 percent from the 
previous forecast the report said it attributed a significant 
amount of the gain to export enhancement program payments to grain 
companies to subsdize sales 
much of the increase was due to purchases by the soviet union 
and china the report said it said india is also buying more wheat 
this year 
reduced brazilian soybean production was cited by the economists 
as the reason for prospective 300 million increase in oilseed and 
oilseed products exports to 77 billion most of the increase was 
expected to be in soybeans 
the increase also was expected to more than offset by a 
prospective reduction in soybean meal exports 
exports of sunflower seed oil should reach 300000 tons the 
report said from a previous forecast of 200000 tons 
competitive prices stemming from the lower dollar plus a 
substantial boost in us almond sales in western europe and the 
soviet union are contributing to improved prospects for 
horticultural products the economists said they put the forecast 
at 37 billion an increase of 200 million from the previous 
forecast 
coarse grain rice cotton and tobacco exports were expected to 
remain at the levels forecast in february according to the 
document

an 18yearold rule that bars husbands and 
their wives from each collecting federal farm payments is being 
eased 
responding to a federal court order agriculture secretary 
richard e lyng said the agriculture department would no longer 
consider husbands and wives engaged in separate farming operations 
before and after their marriage as one person when federal 
payments are being figured 
under the rule when husband and wife are viewed as one 
person they are eligible for only one payment 
the announcement wednesday came after a us district court here 
ordered the department to halt the practice with respect to 
husbands and wives who contribute equally to farming operations 
the court acted in a lawsuit filed by women involved in farm 
economics wife a nationwide organization of farm women it 
called the rule unfair 
lyng said the new rule would apply to the 1988 crop year and was 
subject to revocation if usda wins its appeal of the lower court 
ruling 
the payments would have to be refunded with interest if the 
appeals court overturns the ruling lyng added

jesse jackson says the vice presidency is a 
great job and anyone who thinks he wouldnt want it should think 
again 
while jackson didnt come out and say he wants the post he used 
glowing terms wednesday to characterize it as a position of great 
leadership and great responsibility 
you understand my background the baptist minster who was 
born illegitimately to a poor teenage girl in south carolina asked 
reporters wednesday 
the vice presidency is not quite the top but its a long way 
from where i started he added speaking on the day after he 
suffered a final round of primary losses to michael dukakis 
jackson arrived wednesday night at the posh la costa resort near 
san diego he had no activities scheduled today except an afternoon 
meeting with aides 
jackson has been saying for some time that he deserves to be 
considered for the no 2 spot on the ticket after dukakis won 
enough delegates for the nomination jackson took it one step 
further 
consideration means an offer he said if in fact the 
offer is made at that time ill make a judgment but ive earned 
that option 
he told reporters he has a good resume for the job 
if the issue is we need someone from the south im from the 
south he said someone who can mobilize masses of democrats 
ive done that someone not limited to regional appeal but has 
national appeal ive won primaries across the nation 
on the day after dukakis beat him resoundingly in the last four 
primary contests jackson was asked if he were conceding the 
nomination 
of course not he said the nominee will be determined by 
the convention in atlanta 
however he extended congratulations to dukakis on tuesday night 
after the massachusetts governor won primaries in california new 
jersey new mexico and montana 
jackson said he will be contacting all the socalled super 
delegates and atlarge delegates even those who have announced 
support for dukakis 
these delegates are by definition not committed until they 
vote their votes are fluid we will compete in every state and in 
every congressional district for their support he said 
jackson announced a busy schedule for the weeks leading up to 
the convention 
he will hold strategy meetings with advisers regarding the 
convention and a series of meetings with interest groups beginning 
next week with civil rights leaders in chicago 
jackson also plans speaking appearances a voter registration 
drive and a strategy to woo more delegates to his side 
between now and the convention jackson said he wants to press 
dukakis and the democrats to come around to his positions on issues 
and on delegate selection rules that he considers unfair 
he indicated he expects to have such changes apply not only to 
future conventions but to be put in place this year to help him 
garner the added delegate strength he believes he has earned 
he cited pennsylvania and new jersey where the winner of each 
district gets all that districts delegates rather than having 
them distributed proportionately according to the popular vote for 
jackson that resulted in far fewer delegates than he would have 
received if they were chosen proportionately 
he said he had spoken wednesday morning to democratic party 
chairman paul kirk and was confident they could work out some 
remedy

here are some highlights of the housesenate 
compromise catastrophic health insurance bill 
hospital full coverage for 365 days a year of hospital bills 
after a onceayear deductible estimated at 564 in 1989 the 
deductible is indexed to rising hospital costs medicare now 
charges a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and 
provides full payment for just 59 days a year 
doctor bills full payment of reasonable and proper doctor 
bills after a 1370 annual cap is met medicare continues to pay 
80 percent of charges after a 75 deductible both the initial 
deductible and the 20 percent patient copayment will count toward 
the 1370 cap patient remains responsible for that portion of 
fees that exceed the amount allowed by medicare 
drugs medicare pays 50 percent of outpatient drug costs after 
a 600 annual deductible starting in 1991 medicare pays 60 
percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter 
with the deductible to be indexed to rising drug costs medicare 
now has no acrosstheboard prescription drug coverage 
costs to be paid solely by medicare beneficiaries current 
part b premium of 2480 to increase by 4 a month in 1989 by 
1993 the catastrophic monthly premium is projected at 1020 
in addition to whatever the regular part b premium is at that time 
more than 60 percent of total program costs are to be financed by 
an additional supplemental premium that is linked to federal 
income tax liability the supplemental starts at 2250 a year per 
150 of tax liability in 1989 rising to 42 a year per 150 of tax 
liability in 1993 
nursing home expands number of days per year for skilled 
nursing facility care from 100 days to 150 and reduces copayment 
from 6750 a day after 20th day to 2050 a day for first eight 
days then none no provision for longterm custodial care 
respite care 80 hours per year home health services to relieve 
unpaid care providers this is a new benefit 
home health care expands present coverage of up to three weeks 
of care per illness for five days per week to up to 38 days of care 
per illness for seven days per week 
hospice care expands present 210 days per year to 365 days per 
year as long as patient is certified as terminally ill 
mammograms a mammogram examination every other year for women 
over 65 this is a new benefit 
medicaid the bill phases in over four years a requirement 
that state medicaid programs pay all medicare premiums deductibles 
and copayments for the elderly and disabled with incomes below the 
federal poverty line but too high to qualify for medicaid coverage 
this improvement varies widely from state to state depending on 
what the state already does 
spousal impoverishment gradually raises the income that may be 
retained by a spouse remaining in the community when the husband or 
wife has to go to a nursing home at medicaid expense starting oct 
1 1989 the spouse at home can keep at least 786 per month or 
122 percent of the federal poverty level for a twoperson family 
spouse also allowed to keep up to 12000 in liquid assets

here are some questions and answers about the 
housesenate compromise catastrophic health insurance bill 
q whats the purpose behind this legislation 
a to insure americas 32 million medicare beneficaries most 
of them elderly against financial ruin from a particular illness 
or series of illnesses 
q how does it do this 
a by setting a limit on the amount of money people covered by 
medicare will have to pay out of their pockets above that limit 
the government picks up the costs 
q how is it financed 
a by the medicare beneficiaries themselves 
q how 
a through a combination of flat monthly premiums on all 
medicare recipients and an additional supplemental premium that 
works like an income tax surcharge it assesses those who can 
afford to pay more 
q but its only the elderly who have to pay the higher tax 
a the elderly and about 3 million disabled people under age 65 
who are covered by medicare the tax would be imposed if they have 
enough taxable income to pay income taxes 
q there are about 29 million elderly people you mean their 
taxes are being raised 
a estimates are that about 60 percent of the people over 65 
dont have enough income to pay income taxes and therefore will pay 
only the higher flat monthly premium 
q how much is that 
a in the first year of the plan 1989 it is 4 a month by 
1993 the catastrophic monthly premium will be 1020 
q what about the tax for the other 40 percent 
a it varies according to income for example it starts at 
2250 a year per 150 of federal income tax liability in 1989 and 
rises to 42 a year per 150 of tax liability in 1993 
q how much money does a person have to make before having to 
pay the supplemental premium 
a the estimates are that individuals with incomes below 10000 
a year would not be subject to the supplemental premium or tax 
surcharge if that is what you prefer to call it 
q what do they get for their money 
a medicare will pay full charges for 365 days hospitalization a 
year instead of 60 days as the law presently provides there is a 
one day deductible of 564 in 1989 
q i have to pay that deductible every time i go in the hospital 
now does that change 
a yes no matter how many times you are hospitalized from 1989 
on or for how many total days you only pay one deductible a year 
q how about doctor bills 
a medicare will pay all reasonable and proper charges after 
you pay out 1370 from your own pocket in any given year 
q that doesnt sound like an improvement i only have to pay a 
75 deductible now before medicare kicks in 
a thats true but under the new plan medicare still will pay 
80 percent of your reasonable and proper charges after the 75 
deductible under the expansion the 75 you pay up front and your 
20 percent share will count toward your 1370 annual cap 
after that medicare pays 100 percent of reasonable and proper 
charges 
q reasonable and proper that sounds like some kind of 
loophole 
a it is important to understand what that means so you wont be 
surprised by a big bill medicare wont pay medicare has a set fee 
schedule for every kind of treatment provided by doctors and your 
doctor knows what that fee is however many think it is too low 
and charge their customers more than what the government thinks is 
reasonable and proper if your doctor is one of those it is 
between you and him or her to settle up on the amount medicare 
wont pay an increasing number of doctors accept medicare as 
payment in full and the government is trying to push even more to 
do so 
q didnt i hear something about a new prescription drug benefit 
a yes there will be a general prescription drug benefit for 
the first time since medicare was set up 23 years ago medicare 
will pay half of outpatient drug costs after a 600 annual 
deductible starting in 1991 medicare pays 60 percent the 
following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter 
q anything else new 
a effective in 1990 medicare will pay for a mammogram every 
other year for women 65 and older and at various intervals for 
younger women covered by medicare 
q i hear this bill does nothing for people who have to go into 
nursing homes 
a thats correct if youre talking longterm custodial care 
the sort of situation in which an elderly person too frail to live 
alone but not necessarily needing hospitalization goes to a 
nursing home 
q what other kind is there 
a what is called skilled nursing home care where a person needs 
special care to recuperate from a serious illness 
q what does this bill do in that area 
a expands the number of days covered from 100 days to 150 days 
per year and the person covered no longer will have to spend at 
least three days in a hospital before becoming eligible 
q anything else 
a yes instead of having to pay 6750 per day for each day 
beyond 20 days out of his own pocket as is the case now after 
1989 the person will have to pay 2050 a day for the first eight 
days and the next 142 days are free

nearly 20 years after happy birthday wanda 
june opened offbroadway author kurt vonnegut says hes glad the 
play is no longer seen as a political statement 
when the play opened there were strong divisions about the 
vietnam war said vonnegut 65 it was a confusing time today 
it stands as a play and not a political statement and i much 
prefer it that way 
last year director joe abramo told vonnegut the rocky mountain 
theater guild planned to stage wanda june in denver it was 
scheduled to open today at the university of denver 
i envisioned him coming here to do some kind of workshop 
abramo said he told me he had been on the road for many years 
and was staying away from that but he was happy that someone was 
doing the play 
in wanda june a swaggering adventurer and male supremacist 
named harold ryan returns from eight years in the amazon rain 
forest having missed the 1960s altogether his wife penelope 
believing harold was dead had formed a romantic attachment with a 
pacifist 
when harolds roughneck values clash with her new loves 
peacemongering penelope is forced to confront her feelings for 
each man 
the original production of wanda june received mixed reviews 
and was closed early because of an actors strike 
it had the life it deserved vonnegut said novelists 
arent good playwrights anyway

archbishop teklehaimanot the 
former barefoot monk who led ethiopias 20 million orthodox 
christians through the turbulent transition from feudal empire to 
marxist state has died he was 70 
state television and radio gave unexpectedly long coverage to 
teklehaimanots funeral wednesday including a halfmile procession 
with much pomp through downtown addis ababa to trinity cathedral 
for the requiem 
thousands of weeping ethiopians laid flowers on his coffin 
memorial services have been held across this east african nation 
for the patriarch who died sunday night after an undisclosed 
illness 
teklehaimanot dedicated his life to missionary work in primitive 
rural areas and was more at home shepherding his peasant converts 
than with the pomp of high church life 
he was elected patriarch in june 1976 at a time when the new 
military government was attacking the church for its opposition to 
change 
significantly the former father melaku chose the name 
teklehaimanot which means the tree of faith 
teklehaimanot replaced archbishop or abune tewoflos an 
urbane and widely traveled man who was detained in february 1975 
five months after a marxist clique of army officers overthrew 
emperor haile selassie 
president mengistu haile mariams government never brought 
charges against tewoflos whose fate is unknown 
after teklehaimanot was elected patriarch the government 
continued its onslaught against the church nationalizing its vast 
lands and buildings 
the government gave the church a modest annual budget but 
ethiopians flocked to church in the millions after the revolution 
attendance was at an alltime high and most parishes were 
selfsupporting 
anecdotes spread overnight that the new patriarch had difficulty 
wearing his new shoes and was more comfortable in the rough yellow 
kaftan of a monk than the fine robes of a prelate 
within months of his election the frail sadfaced monk was 
accepted as a humble and dedicated churchman whose ambition was to 
guide his adherents through the turbulent times without 
confrontation with the new military rulers 
teklehaimanot involved the church in relief work in 
droughtstricken areas and often weeped openly when he preached of 
the plight of famine and drought victims 
nearly half of ethiopias 44 million people belong to the 
orthodox church while the remainder are mostly moslems 
teklehaimanot was born into a poor farming family in northern 
showa province he proselytized in remote parts of southern sidamo 
region bringing christianity to an area where paganism was 
widespread 
christianity was introduced to ethiopia in the 4th century by a 
syrian boy called frumentius who converted the king ezana

sweden became the first nation to 
endorse a program to rid itself of nuclear power as its parliament 
voted to unplug two nuclear reactors by 1996 
the bill adopted tuesday set the timetable for dismantling the 
first of swedens 12 reactors and established a mechanism for 
deciding when to shut down the others within 21 years 
the bill passed with support of 160 of parliaments 349 
legislators but 70 others voted against and 82 abstained the rest 
were absent 
under the law one reactor will close in the barseback complex 
in southern sweden and another in ringhals on the western coast 
swedes voted in a 1980 nonbinding referendum to dismantle 
nuclear energy by the year 2010 
though the power stations have proven safe and provided cheap 
electricity energy minister birgitta dahl said it is a matter of 
honor to keep the referendums promise 
but doubts remain about the wisdom of the publics decision 
taken in the heat of worldwide debate following the nuclear 
accident at three mile island the plant near harrisburg pa was 
damaged in march 1979 after a combination of human and mechanical 
errors led to a partial meltdown of the nuclear core 
swedens first reactor was built in 1971 and the final two were 
installed five years after the referendum 
nuclear power provides half the energy needs of sweden a 
country slightly larger than california with a population of 84 
million 
dismantling the two reactors could cost 800 million and the 
nuclear plants will probably be replaced with coal or oilfired 
stations according to vattenfall the governments energy agency 
swedes now pay about three cents per kilowatt hour which means 
an average household pays about 30 a month for electricity 
including heating during the long frigid winters 
fear of expensive bills has prompted some industrialists and the 
largest trade unions to voice reservations about eliminating 
nuclear power 
critics of the nuclear shutdown also say dirty fossilfuel 
energy that replaces atomic power will threaten swedens pristine 
forests and hundreds of thousands of clear lakes 
but sweden was hit badly by the 1986 chernobyl accident costing 
the authorities 84 million to compensate reindeer herdsmen and 
farmers for contamination and to counter other effects said the 
radiation protection board 
the government plans new investment in hydroelectric power oil 
gas and coal plants and in wind power a government committee is 
investigating the possibility of placing hundreds of 300foothigh 
windmills off the island of oland in the baltic sea

a genetic study of the family tree of the 
aids virus suggests it may have appeared only about 40 years ago 
scientists reported today 
at most the results suggest it probably evolved from its west 
african cousin within the last 100 years said researcher temple 
smith 
aids viruses are found in humans and monkeys but the study 
could not determine whether an ancestral virus jumped from monkeys 
to humans or vice versa said smith director of the molecular 
biology computer research resource at the danafarber cancer 
institute of harvard medical school 
the work follows a study published last week that suggested an 
ancestral aids virus infected the primitive ancestors of humans and 
monkeys more than 20 million years ago smith said he doubts that 
conclusion 
the new work which used a different method of analysis appears 
in the british journal nature smith wrote it with colleagues at 
the us centers for disease control in atlanta and the los alamos 
national laboratory in new mexico 
it concerns the aids virus called hiv1 a west african 
relative called hiv2 and a monkey aids virus called siv 
researchers focused on genes which act as inherited blueprints 
for proteins from the coating of the viruses they compared genes 
from a total of seven samples of hiv1 and hiv2 plus two samples 
of siv 
after defining similarities and differences that resulted from 
the evolutionary history of each virus sample they constructed a 
family tree that would account for the similarities and differences 
they found 
to measure how fast hiv1 was evolving they compared a 1976 
sample to others found during the 1980s 
results suggest that hiv1 and hiv2 split into separate 
evolutionary paths at least 40 years ago smith said in a telephone 
interview and unless there is something very unusual going on 
he said the split must have occurred no more than 80 to 100 years 
ago 
russell doolittle biology professor at the university of 
california san diego said the estimate made sense to him 
other researchers also have concluded the split in the human 
virus occurred relatively recently said doolittle who has studied 
the evolution of the family of viruses that includes the one 
causing acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
smith said the monkey virus also have split from the human 
viruses 40 years to 100 years ago but that assumes that the monkey 
virus has evolved at about the same rate as the human viruses and 
no information is available on that smith said 
such a recent branching into human and monkey viruses contrasts 
sharply with last weeks study that suggests the split occurred 
more than 20 million years ago when humans and monkeys went their 
own ways on the family primate tree 
smith said he doubted that various samples of the human aids 
virus found so far would resemble each other so closely if a human 
version had so much time to evolve into different variants

the nations first test of distributing 
hypodermic needles to drug users for curbing aids will begin next 
month in portland ore and the prosecutor says its worth a try 
im saddened we have a population that warrants such a 
program but i see there are valid public health and public policy 
reasons for such a program or at least putting it in place said 
multnomah county district attorney michael schrunk 
to me the aids prevention and the drug treatment counseling 
for each participant is really the key to it he said in a 
telephone interview 
such counseling may reach people who would not otherwise get it 
so it may well benefit the community he said im willing to 
gamble the counseling will be good 
but schrunk who said he believed in a firm drug enforcement 
policy declined to say whether the program would break laws 
those are things well have to work through he said 
legal opposition has been holding up a similar program in new 
york city in massachusetts state lawmakers on wednesday debated a 
needle distribution program in boston 
the oregon project will be conducted by outsidein a social 
service agency under a 67000 grant from the american foundation 
for aids research said kathy oliver outsideins executive 
director 
the yearlong program in which 125 drug abusers will get 
counseling and exchange used needles for new ones is designed to 
study whether such programs can reduce the spread of the aids virus 
among drug abusers said project consultant don des jarlais of 
narcotic and drug research inc a nonprofit new york foundation 
a needle used by an infected person can infect the next person 
who uses it besides providing sterile needles exchange programs 
provide opportunity for counseling about drugs and aids said des 
jarlais who is also coordinator of aids research for the new york 
state division of substance abuse services 
he and other health officials said they knew of no other such 
program in the nation 
no starting time has been set for new york citys planned 
program which must wait at least until a state regulation allowing 
it takes effect next month said city health department spokesman 
sam friedman 
in addition officials must complete delicate conversations 
with law enforcement and prosecutorial people in new york city 
he said 
the citys special drug prosecutor in february declared that 
dispensing the needles would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to a 
year in prison 
in boston the legislatures health care committee conducted a 
hearing on a bill that would allow the city to set up a pilot 
needle exchange for six months 
such programs have begun in europe but the idea has sparked 
controversy in the united states 
it does carry an implied message that government is condoning 
the drug use which we think is an inappropriate message for 
youth said allan randall of the national federation of parents 
for drugfree youth based in silver spring md 
but des jarlais said he believes the portland program will send 
the opposite message because of its drug counseling 
to qualify for the portland program a person will have to admit 
intravenous drug use show identifiable injection marks and have a 
needle to exchange for a new one but no used needle will be 
required the first time they get a new one 
about 5 percent of the portland areas estimated 7000 to 10000 
intravenous drug users are thought to be infected with the virus 
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome des jarlais said 
but that proportion could jump to 50 percent in a few years 
unless effective action is taken he said 
participants in portland will be interviewed and their blood 
tested periodically results will be compared to members of a 
second group of drug injectors recruited from 11 other cities and 
matched to the participants for such characteristics as race age 
and the period since the person began regular injections 
a third group will be 125 people seen at outsidein who have 
histories of using noninjected drugs they will be compared to a 
fourth group of similar size from new york city of people who do 
not inject drugs but are high risk for starting injections because 
of their use of heroin or cocaine 
both noninjecting groups will receive limited aids education 
and counseling they will be included to see if needle programs 
encourage noninjectors to start intravenous drug abuse a prospect 
most experts doubt des jarlais said

plo chairman yasser arafat asked arab 
leaders for more support for palestinian protests in israeliheld 
territories and jordans king hussein blamed the united states for 
the middle east deadlock 
despite arafats plea wednesday delegates from 20 nations at 
the arab league summit did not immediately extend new financial aid 
for the uprising in the west bank and gaza strip 
summit sources said arab leaders were discussing financial 
support for the uprising in the range of 300 million to 400 
million to compensate for loss of income caused by strikes 
but nothing had been done about by wednesday evening 
the threeday summit opened tuesday to discuss ways of backing 
the 6monthold palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza 
strip in which more than 200 palestinians have died 
hussein speaking behind closed doors to the leaders of the 
palestine liberation organization and the arab nations endorsed 
some aspects of secretary of state george p shultzs middle east 
peace plan 
but he accused the united states of dragging its feet on a 
middle east peace settlement 
the united states has no middle east policy other than support 
for israel hussein said 
hussein who lost the west bank to israel in the 1967 war urged 
arab states to keep up the pressure on israel by encouraging and 
subsidizing the continuing palestinian revolt in the occupied 
territories 
the king renewed his endorsement of the plo as the palestinians 
sole legitimate representative and said he would not be 
involved in any peace process that did not include plo 
participation 
aides distributed copies of his speech to reporters 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi meanwhile angered some 
delegates by telling arab leaders who collaborate with the united 
states that they undermine the arab cause and should go to 
hell he did not refer to any leaders by name 
gadhafi wore a white glove on his right hand and one libyan 
delegate said the glove was intended to avoid contact with a hand 
that shook that of israeli foreign minister shimon peres 
moroccos king hassan ii received peres then prime minister in 
july 1986 
hussein also said in his speech that if arab leaders make the 
establishment of a palestinian state a condition for a peace 
conference then we shall not differ with them on that 
but he cautioned that such a stand which conflicts sharply with 
american and israeli positions may end hope for convening an 
international middle east peace conference 
egypt was not invited to the summit it was suspended from the 
arab league in 1979 after agreeing to the camp david peace accord 
with israel

the cumbersome launchers and the 
cruise missiles are lined up inside this us air force base the 
antinuclear protesters remain outside and everybody is waiting 
for the soviet inspectors 
they could do it today im ready to go said col william 
e jones an ebullient tennessean who is the commander at greenham 
common 50 miles west of london 
i have 29 launchers i have 101 missiles everything i have is 
for display he said wednesday 
in the background photographers milled round a 55foot missile 
launcher on show for the first time 
us military authorities lifted the veil at greenham common and 
two other intermediaterange nuclear missile bases at florennes 
belgium and mutlangen a pershing ii missile base in west germany 
ahead of the soviet visits 
the teams of up to 10 inspectors are due to arrive at 16 hours 
notice sometime in july or august implementing the first step of 
the superpower accord to eliminate by 1991 the 2700 landbased 
intermediate range missiles both sides have deployed in europe 
the initial checks under the agreement ratified june 1 are to 
inspect the missiles before they are dismantled 
while soviet inspectors visit 12 bases in five west european 
countries and 14 in the united states american teams have a 
reciprocal right to check 133 sites in eastern europe 
during the greenham display the launchers which are scheduled 
for destruction along with their missiles trundled out of giant 
bunkers ringed by four layers of rolled barbed wire then roared 
through muddy lanes showing off their paces 
on the perimeter fence a favorite target of protesters hung a 
banner with the slogan bread not bombs a solitary woman 
protester tried to climb the fence but jumped back and disappeared 
outside a nearby gate a dishevelled halfdozen group of women 
protesters sat round a camp fire a broken baby carriage and other 
litter in the background 
women protesters have camped at greenham since 1981 two years 
before the cruise missiles arrived 
on wednesday they said that they or others will still be 
living in the tent and plastic camps here long after the missiles 
have gone eversuspicious that cruise missiles will simply be 
replaced by something just as deadly 
the americans have a history of reneging on agreements said 
a young woman in her 20s a former clerk who identified herself as 
xak aroo 
so theyre going to take out the cruise its no big deal we 
object to americans being here anyway 
inside the base preparations have included fullscale rehearsals 
mock inspections with pentagon officials playing the part of 
soviet inspectors 
the first group played very belligerent out of sorts soviets 
and we had to deal with that said lt col michael mccarney 
the second group were what we expect very professional very 
businesslike soviets and we found that you really could do the 
inspection in two to three hours 
mccarney project director for the inspection arrangements said 
he does not expect suspicion to cloud each soviet visit 
i think they are as anxious as we are to make this thing 
work he said 
the fine print of the agreement means that the longest soviet 
teams can stay on any one inspection visit is 4 days 
the visitors will fly to greenham and remain at the base or go 
under escort to the second cruise base in britain at molesworth 
near cambridge where 24 missiles are deployed 
mccarney said hes laying on a few extra touches miniature 
bottles of vodka and videos hes also been collecting sears 
roebuck department store catalogues because he said thats what 
soviets who inspected a facility in san diego recently took home

housepassed legislation would restore limits 
to the amount of advertising during childrens television programs 
a measure opposed by the reagan administration as inimical to 
free speech rights 
lawmakers voted 32878 on wednesday for the bipartisan measure 
which would limit commercials in childrens programs to 10 minutes 
per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays 
in a related action wednesday the senate voted approval of a 
bill designed to curb violence on television 
that measure sponsored by sen paul simon dill exempts 
members of the television industry from federal antitrust laws for 
three years to allow them to work together to develop voluntary 
standards on tv violence 
the bill approved on a voice vote moves to the house where 
the judiciary committee plans to hold hearings shortly 
the fcc abandoned its childrens tv advertising limits four 
years ago on the theory that commercials would be regulated by 
marketplace forces 
the housepassed bill would give tv stations until jan 1 1990 
to comply with new ad limits and it would allow the fcc to modify 
the time standards after jan 1 1993 
during debate on the bill rep edward j markey dmass said 
for far too long we have allowed childrens television to be 
driven solely by commercial considerations 
rep matthew j rinaldo rnj ranking republican on the 
subcommittee said the measure strikes a balance between 
financial support for childrens programming and the desire to 
shield children from overexposure to commercial messages 
opponents say the measure is misdirected and raises 
constitutional questions 
an administration statement said attempts such as this one 
to inject the federal government into programming and advertising 
decisions that are properly those of television broadcast 
licensees are inappropriate illadvised and inimical to the 
spirit of the first amendment 
the house compromise was stripped of earlier proposals to 
prohibit programs that feature toy manufacturers products 
referred to by critics as programlength commercials 
legislation pending in the senate would ban such programs no 
hearings have been scheduled on the senate bill which is sponsored 
by sen howard metzenbaum dohio

base 
they had been with us for some time doing touchandgo 
training landings said richard brewer air traffic manager at 
the northeast mississippi airport the plane was in the pattern 
and the first we knew something was wrong was when it impacted 
witnesses said the plane appeared to veer to its left as it was 
landing and crashed into a clearing near the runway military 
authorities sealed off the area shortly after the accident 
when i saw it it was a just a big fireball said kellems 
another witness said the plane appeared to nose straight into 
the ground and the tail and six or seven feet of the body of the 
plane were the only sections left intact 
four bodies were recovered by late wednesday and the remains of 
the two others were believed under the wreckage said col dennis 
wood another spokesman for the base 
a spokeswoman for the air force base airman 1st class deborah

bates said a board of officers will investigate the accident 
bates also said it is not unusual for members of the arkansas 
air national guard to be on training missions out of state 
the most recent crash of a c130 stationed at little rock was in 
march 1985 when a crash near fort hood texas killed six crewmen 
prior to that seven airmen were killed when a c130 exploded 
and crashed near judsonia ark on may 12 1982 due to mechanical 
failure

most can take care of themselves 
in two clashes near the west bank city of nablus on wednesday 
troops shot and wounded four palestinians hospital officials said 
the army confirmed the shootings in the balata refugee camp and the 
nearby village beit fourik but put the number of wounded at three 
an israeli driver suffered minor injuries when assailants threw

the army said soldiers later clamped a curfew on the village 
in a new leaflet issued this week the united leadership of the 
uprising led by the palestine liberation organization ordered 
palestinians to shutter their stores and stay away from their jobs 
today 
since the antioccupation unrest began dec 8 in the lands 
israel seized in the 1967 middle east war 202 palestinians and two

the veterans administration says there is a 
growing scientific consensus that the herbicide agent orange 
cannot be conclusively blamed for cancer and other illnesses among 
vietnam veterans 
thomas e harvey the va deputy administrator told the house 
committee on veterans affairs on wednesday studies have 
demonstrated no basis for the nation to compensate vietnam veterans 
based on their exposure to agent orange 
he said none of the numerous studies on dioxin the contaminant 
in agent orange has established that the chemical causes cancers 
or illness among veterans or birth defects in their children 
but he told the panel further research is needed as a result of 
one study that showed an inconclusive association between 
herbicide exposure and nonhodgkins lymphoma a type of cancer 
harvey said the vas agent orange registry has now recorded the 
results of physical examinations of 220000 vietnam veterans and 
still does not show any unusual health patterns among them

the bill approved 2513 on wednesday and sent to the house 
public works and transportation committee would grant a coal 
pipeline company the power of eminent domain to enable it to 
condemn land needed for the facility

a black woman was holed up in a church a second 
day today after being sentenced to jail for not testifying about 
her daughters alleged rape by whites and a family adviser 
insisted we will never back down 
glenda brawley probably will not be arrested as long as she 
remains in the queens church state attorney general robert abrams 
said wednesday 
that decision is in the hands of the sheriff said abrams 
the special prosecutor in the investigation 
but i think he and i agree that if we charge that church 
today that would be precisely what the advisers for the brawley 
family would want in terms of their agenda and another chapter of 
the media circus they have performed 
mrs brawley 33 spent wednesday in the ebenezer baptist 
church where more than 400 supporters gathered in the evening for 
a prayer service giving her a standing ovation 
we will never back down we will never give up we will never 
buckle under we will never apologize the rev al sharpton one 
of mrs brawleys advisers told the gathering 
in poughkeepsie where a grand jury investigating the case met 
again wednesday abrams said if glenda brawley chooses to exile 
herself confine herself jail herself in a particular church and 
she wants to do it for a day 10 days 30 days thats her choosing 
its only going to be added to and on top of a 30day 
eventual jail sentence she will have to serve for her violation of 
the courts order 
dutchess county sheriff fred scoralick refused to say what 
action if any was being taken on tuesday the department issued 
a statewide arrest warrant for mrs brawley 
sharpton said were going to stay here until the warrant is 
killed 
tawana brawley 16 disappeared for four days in november and 
was found wrapped in a plastic bag about 10 miles from her 
wappingers falls home 
some of her hair had been chopped off animal excrement was 
smeared and racial epithets were scrawled on her body 
in sketchy interviews with authorities she said she had been 
abducted and sexually abused by six white men one of whom had a 
policestyle badge a hospital found no evidence of rape 
her mother was sentenced monday to 30 days in jail for defying a 
grand jury subpoena but she had been given until wednesday to 
cooperate mrs brawley made no statements wednesday 
sharpton and lawyers alton maddox jr and c vernon mason say 
miss brawley and her mother wont cooperate with the grand jury 
which they claim is biased against blacks 
they have accused authorities of conspiring in a coverup and 
are demanding a new special prosecutor 
weve got the facts and the evidence sharpton said during 
the prayer service addressing abrams and gov mario cuomo all 
youve got to do is call our bluff and give us an impartial 
prosecutor give us a prosecutor and tell us to put up or shut up 
cuomo on wednesday supported abrams handling of the case 
referring to the brawley advisers he said they say in effect no 
black person gets justice in this state and therefore they will 
not participate 
if they were to be utterly logical then no black person 
should ever pay a parking ticket no black person should ever pay 
their income taxes nor serve on a jury nor in any way participate 
in this society and thats an absurdity i think most of this 
state and most of the country recognize it for what it is 
the attorney general has said that if there is no cooperation 
from the family the grand jury would likely wind up its 
investigation in about a month

the soviet union has stolen the 
disarmament show with a dramatic invitation to un leaders to 
witness the destruction of intermediaterange nuclear missiles on 
its soil next month 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze speaking 
wednesday at a un disarmament session asked secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar members of the security council and 
representatives of the 102nation nonaligned movement to come to 
the nuclear bonfire in july 
it will be not the bolshoi theater but a major premiere 
nonetheless a momentuous historic event he declared 
when the first public execution of weapons in human history 
takes place no one is likely to cry or weep it will herald an end 
to a lot of tears he said but having dug a grave for weapons 
of mass destruction mankind must now build the foundation of a 
nuclearfree and nonviolent world 
diplomats said shevardnadzes speech was a tour de force that 
put the united states on the diplomatic defensive 
even us ambassador vernon a walters praised the speech as 
hopeful useful and good 
it was an extremely interesting new speech it broke a lot of 
new ground and it is deserving of study he said 
secretary of state george p shultz plans to deliver a us 
statement before the 40nation conference next week 
but diplomats speculated that vice president george bush or 
even president reagan might make a lastminute decision to offset 
the soviet firststrike advantage and deliver a weighty american 
rejoinder 
the soviet union got on the stage first and kept up the 
momentum of its view from the moscow summit they showed they are 
in the forefront of the disarmament effort said one un 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity they have made the 
un their forum 
the missiles will be among the first scrapped under the 
nowratified intermediate nuclear forces treaty 
in a news conference wednesday soviet arms negotiator viktor 
karpov said the destruction of the missiles would begin soon after 
july 1 under the treaty all 2700 landbased intermediaterange 
missiles the superpowers have deployed in europe are to be 
destroyed by 1991 
in his speech shevardnadze also invited the united states to 
join the soviet union in banning all nuclear tests as the first 
move toward a stepbystep elimination of nuclear weapons by the 
year 2000 
and for the first time he said the soviet union would announce 
the presence or absence of nuclear weapons on naval ships on 
foreign port calls if the united states and western allies do the 
same 
the united states has consistently refused to confirm or deny 
whether its ships are nuclearpowered or carry nuclear weapons 
shevardnadze also called for the north atlantic treaty 
organization and the warsaw pact each to reduce their forces by 
500000 troops 
in august 1985 the soviet union commenced a unilateral nuclear 
test moratorium but the united states continued testing the 
soviets ended their moratorium 1 years later 
on the basis of reciprocity with the united states we are 
ready to reintroduce and to observe it this time not for a year 
and a half but for all times shevardnadze said 
on conventional disarmament the area in which nato says the 
soviets hold a clear advantage in europe shevardnadze proposed an 
exchange of official data on troop strength followed by onsite 
inspections 
this session the third in 10 years is debating disarmament 
issues and will draw up a declaration of objectives and an 
international action plan 
those attending include prime minister noburo takeshita of 
japan prime minister rajiv gandhi of india president and nobel 
prize winner oscar arias of costa rica british foreign secretary 
sir geoffrey howe and prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel 
shevardnadze also called for 
a global ban on chemical weapons 
establishment of a un agency that would coordinate and 
monitor arms reduction agreements verify compliance and monitor 
the military situation in conflict areas 
preventing the introduction of weapons into outer space and 
establishment of an international space monitoring agency 
restrictions on sales and supplies of conventional arms 
limits on development of more destructive conventional arms and 
new technologies such as laser beams genetic and electromagnetic 
systems 
including naval forces in disarmament negotiations 
creation of un naval forces of permanent security council 
members he proposed a joint trial in which the member fleets would 
practice maintaining freedom of navigation by un forces 
the united states and many western countries which have naval 
forces in the middle east have opposed a un force as unworkable

the united states plans to urge its western 
european allies to use economic assistance to eastern europe as a 
lever to bring about political reforms in the soviet satellites a 
us official said 
the 16 nato foreign ministers meeting here today and friday plan 
to focus on the outlook for eastern europe in light of mikhail s 
gobachevs push for reforms in the soviet union 
lord carrington the nato secretarygeneral said the alliance 
has a great interest in the new soviet policy of political and 
economic change and what effect it will have on us 
the council of the north atlantic treaty organization holds its 
semiannual spring assembly in madrid on thursday and friday 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
eastern europe will be a testing ground for gorbachevs 
reforms the official added that the united states will urge its 
european allies not to aid eastern european countries unless they 
undertake substantial political reforms 
the united states has been making the point all along that 
economic reform is not going to work unless there is political 
reform as well the official said 
the united states will be represented by secretary of state 
george p shultz alton keel jr us ambassador to nato and 
roseanne ridgeway the assistant secretary of state for european 
affairs 
no formal communique will be issued when the meeting ends 
friday but carrington said he would read a brief statement 
east european nations in the warsaw pact the soviet blocs 
counterpart of nato are bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany 
hungary poland romania and the soviet union 
carrington said the nato ministers would also discuss arms 
control and how nato members divide up the cost of western defense 
that includes transferring 72 us f16 fighterbombers from spain 
to italy acceding to a spanish demand that the fighter wing leave 
its soil 
the councils meeting in madrid is the first in spain since it 
joined nato in may 1982 
spain is not integrated into the nato military command in 
accordance with a march 1986 referendum in which spaniards also 
voted to remain in nato only on condition that us military 
presence in spain be substantially reduced 
the american official said the united states planned to tell its 
allies it feels it is carrying the financial burden of natos 
defense 
he said congress will probably seek a reduction in the 325000 
us troops stationed in europe unless this burden is more 
equitably distributed

a 7yearold chemical poisoning lawsuit 
ended with monsanto co agreeing to pay 12 million to six of the 
173 former workers who sued but one who will share the award said 
the money doesnt make up for his cancer 
as part of the agreement announced wednesday monsanto will pay 
200000 each to the six retired employees who said their exposure 
to a rubber additive at the companys nitro plant gave them bladder 
cancer 
as part of the settlement 127 dioxinrelated claims and 34 
other chemical poisoning claims will be dropped 
in addition the st louisbased corporation agreed to drop its 
300000 courtcosts claim against six other retired workers who 
unsucessfully claimed the company recklessly exposed them to highly 
toxic dioxin at the plant monsanto had attached liens to their 
homes to guarantee payment 
im pleased with it said retired worker john hein of the 
200000 he will receive 
but the nitro resident said the money doesnt make up for 
his illness which sends him to a hospital twice a year for 
treatments he also said he was unhappy that the other plaintiffs 
were left out of the settlement 
theres a lot of them that the statute of limitations ran out 
on i dont like that hein said 
hein was one of the 173 former monsanto workers who filed suit 
in 1981 
he was awarded 200000 in 1985 after proving in an 11month 
trial that exposure to pab a rubber additive caused his cancer 
and that monsanto knew the risk however it wasnt until 
wednesdays settlement that monsanto agreed to pay the award 
but he and six other retirees in the marathon trial lost their 
dioxin poisoning claims and the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
rejected their appeal 
it was after that trial that monsanto sought to recover 
304000 a fraction of its court costs from the retirees the 
workers faced losing their homes if the chemical company prevailed 
the settlement was reached a week before the scheduled us 
district court trial of hein and the five other bladder cancer 
victims who will split the money 
attorney stuart calwell who filed the original lawsuit against 
monsanto said the six pabrelated claims were really all thats 
left of the case 
i am very pleased for my clients he said i think for 
them its a very good settlement 
added monsanto lawyer charles love iii were relieved of 
course that its over we do not believe we injured these people 
intentionally however rather than go through this again we 
decided to settle the matter 
monsanto manufactured pab at its queeney plant in st louis and 
shipped it to nitro for manufacture into rubber chemicals calwell 
said other nitro workers exposed to pab have a precancerous 
condition but were not part of the lawsuit 
until 1983 west virginia law allowed employees to sue their 
employers for jobrelated injuries if workers could improve willful 
and reckless disregard for their safety 
calwell said the case attempted to test the political 
alignment of the courts in this country to determine how much 
risk employers can expose workers to without losing protection from 
civil suits 
the federal jury hearing the dioxin claims found that the 
chemical a byproduct in agent orange production was dangerous to 
monsanto employees health dioxin has been linked to cancer the 
workers said they were exposed when the plant made the herbicide in 
the 1950s and 60s 
the jury ruled that the dioxin claimants failed to prove 
monsanto knowingly risked their safety monsanto then sought the 
court costs 
one of the dioxin plaintiffs lonnie hurley died in 1987 from 
liver cancer that spread into his lungs calwell said during the 
trial calwell had tried to prove that hurleys cancer was 
attributable to his exposure to dioxin while monsanto lawyers 
blamed it on hurleys lifestyle including his cigarette smoking 
we had an autopsy done on lonnie hurley and sent out tissue 
samples and those samples had dioxin in them calwell said

nearly 8 percent of west germans 
are vehemently antisemitic and a third believe jews have too much 
influence in the world according to a survey sponsored by a jewish 
group 
the survey commissioned by the antidefamation league of new 
yorks bnai brith said 15 percent of west germans polled have 
some prejudice against jews it said elderly men rural people and 
those with lowerlevel jobs made up much of the group 
west germanys respected allensbach research and polling 
insitute conducted the study last fall in conjunction with the 
center for research on antisemitism at west berlins technical 
university 
researchers planned to present the study formally at a news 
conference today in berlin they made the written results available 
to the associated press a day in advance 
the pollsters interviewed 2102 people over age 16 in west 
germany and west berlin between sept 24 and oct 5 1987 with a 
standardized questionnaire 
about 33 percent of those polled believe that jewish influence 
in the world is too high but west germans are not fearful of 
jewish influence in their own country the researchers said 
only about 36500 jews remain in west germany and west berlin 
after the nazi holocaust wiped out much of the european jewish 
population 
antisemitism after 1945 in the federal republic west 
germany is largely an antisemitism without jews the survey 
report said that means that antisemitism in the federal 
republic always must be discussed in the context of the nazi era 
the debate over the past and the question of guilt and 
reparations 
the study said overall just under 8 percent of the 
population must be classified as vehemently antisemitic 
it added that 15 percent of the population demonstrated some 
level of antijewish prejudice 
this group is drawn in an aboveaverage way from older men 
above age 60 people in the lower education and job strata and the 
rural population said the study 
violence and vandalism occasionally are directed against jews in 
west germany 
before dawn on april 18 unknown attackers exploded a bomb 
outside frankfurts jewish community center the blast caused 
substantial damage but injured no one 
prosecutors speculate the bomb may have been in retaliation for 
the assassination two days earlier of khalil wazir the palestine 
liberation organization military commander 
on june 4 vandals painted nazi slogans and emblems on a new 
stone memorial for holocaust victims erected in the saarland town 
of waldmohr 
federal officials in bonn say there are about 1520 neonazis in 
west germany and that about 200 of them are considered militant 
west germany continues to pay compensation to jews and other 
victims of the nazis terror the total amount now stands at 48 
billion and is expected to reach 60 billion by the turn of the 
century 
the survey did not address whether antijewish feeling had 
changed after palestinian unrest broke out dec 8 in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip

the man they called indian joe lived 
at pickerel lake for more than 40 years steadfastly guarding his 
precious 232 acres and refusing to sell to developers who promised 
him fortunes 
the death sunday of joseph indian joe cizauskas marked the 
end of an era in kent county outside grand rapids where some say 
the property is worth millions to housing developers 
cizauskas an eccentric loner who poured his earnings into 
buying the land apparently left no will though he was married 
years ago he has no children what happens to the unspoiled 
territory likely will be decided by a court relatives say 
it will likely have to be sold now its a shame someone 
couldnt continue to use the land as he had said rose kerr 
cizauskas niece 
cizauskas who relatives say was about 80 was buried wednesday 
in grand rapids and while the ruggedlooking man with decaying 
teeth and a wild thatch of hair may not have left a will he did 
leave a legacy 
i think his appearance frightened some people but i admired 
him for what he stood for and for what he did said leonard 
weller cannon townships clerk since 1969 
all the material things in life didnt mean much to him the 
houses the radios and televisions the clothes and fancy cars that 
we all want those things didnt mean much to him only his 
land weller said 
cizauskas lived at the end of a long dirt road in a tworoom 
concreteblockandsteel building that had electricity but no 
plumbing he built the place to be fireproof after his ramshackle 
wooden home mysteriously burned eight years ago 
he lived on social security and retirement benefits from his 
years of work in the tannery in rockford 
in the summer he offered a days fishing on his lake for 50 
cents in the late fall customers lined up to select a 5 
christmas tree from the thousands of colorado blue spruce he had 
planted on the rolling land 
though cizauskas weathered features resembled those of an 
american indian he was born in lithuania he attributed his 
nickname to the children who visited him over the years from 
neighboring camp roger 
though he seemed to enjoy his solitude cizauskas freely shared 
his views on everything many of his favorite philosophies 
including his cure for inflation freeze prices could be found 
on handdrawn signs posted about his land 
he wasnt really a hermit he loved to talk to you for a few 
minutes at a time sharing his ideas but he was never long in one 
spot weller said he was always right back to his land 
for the last 10 years township secretary ruth hatt greeted 
cizauskas when he came to the township hall to pay his property tax 
bill he always made the trip in person 
he knew he had to pay and he never griped about it hatt 
said the property was valued at 122200 
in recent visits hatt said she noticed cizauskas wasnt as 
spry as he used to be 
but cizauskas distrusted the medical profession claiming he 
hadnt been examined by a doctor in 30 years 
cizauskas once told a reporter he didnt care what happened to 
the land or his body after he died 
ill tell you he said when i die you can take me out and 
throw me on the garbage heap when youre dead youre dead

remote american outpost during a shoreleave blowout celebrating 
the recent ussoviet fisheries agreement 
more than 600 soviet sailors many clutching fistfuls of 
dollars arrived late tuesday in this aleutian island town of about 
1900 people 800 miles southwest of anchorage 
they were treated to rock music mounds of food and gallons of 
various beverages welcome sights and sounds for soviet sailors who 
had been at sea more than six months 
this is the first time i meet americans said alexander 
cherkov first mate aboard the vessel semiozernoye americans are 
very nice people 
these people are real people an american fisherman who 
identified himself only as captain america slurred as he staggered 
off his arms around two soviet seamen just like you and me can 
you believe it 
the party was held partly to celebrate the fisheries agreement 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev signed during 
last weeks moscow summit meeting the agreement allows us 
vessels to fish in soviet waters and use soviet ports and joint 
fishing and conservation in the north pacific

so but mayor paul fuhs said he could not remember when more 
soviets had visited at one time 
this is great just great said a beaming fuhs who also 
played with one of the rock bands where else could this happen 
fuhs finished the evening with a red carnation tucked behind his 
ear it was one of those nights he said 
as the party picked up steam a soviet maritime officer in full 
uniform tried to make his way across the windblown town dock jammed 
with hundreds of dancing people but was beseiged by giggling 
children he stopped put down his coat and began playing games 
with them 
soviet sailors showered toys candy and other gifts on any child 
in sight 
americans and soviets struggled to converse and traded pins 
hats and anything else not nailed down 
while music blared from the rusty flatbed trailer that served as 
a bandstand the soviets showed old flickering blackandwhile 
films of lenin and soyuz space launches on a screen dangling from 
the side of a ship 
soviet sailors lined up to have their pictures taken with police 
officers off to the side a young soviet seaman quietly played a 
guitar for an american girl 
by nights end the sailors had to help one another back aboard 
their vessels many townspeople were in no better shape 
the party was a success harbormaster gary daily said early 
wednesday everybody seems to have survived 
this is the greatest thing thats ever happened to 
sovietamerican relations said dianna matthias lead observer of 
the soviet fleet for the national marine fisheries service i 
never never again want to hear that these people and americans 
cant get along 
i love these guys said ed cameron a fisherman from tacoma 
wash this is the fishermens summit i could never raise a 
hand or gun to any of them if we ever have a war with them ill 
be a conscientious objector 
the soviets started coming ashore at dutch harbor for crew rests 
around 1985 said mark dudley dutch harbor manager of maritime 
resources co international a joint ussoviet fishing venture 
word spread like wildfire in the soviet fleet dudley said 
yelling to be heard over the music and every year after that 
there have been more and more calls 
he said his company expects its soviet vessels to make about 30 
port calls by years end town officials said they expect perhaps 
10 additional soviet ships 
each ships crew is given up to 20000 to spend here dudley 
said 
the sailors come ashore to buy american and japanese goods 
before the party they descended on stores to stock up on such 
goods as music tapes portable radiotape decks solar powered 
watches ice cream and gum lots of gum 
my kids call it hooba booba said alexander mokhov captain 
of the mys chassavoi a 285foot fish processor they want

attackers tried to assassinate ugandan 
president yoweri museveni after hundreds of his soldiers mutinied 
in april ugandan dissident military officers said 
at least 200 mutineers of the 19th artillery regiment and the 
8th infantry battalion were killed in clashes with 3000 loyal 
troops april 78 before rebel units surrendered the sources said 
wednesday the two units are based near the ugandan capital of 
kampala 
about 700 mutineers were captured and detained by military 
police at luzira prison in kampala said the sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
a presidential convoy was ambushed april 11 on the 22mile 
highway from kampala to the state house in entebbe mutineers 
killed at least 16 military escorts when they fired on two of three 
military trucks the sources said 
but museveni was not traveling in his official bulletproof car 
he had flown by helicopter from kampala to the state house and 
evidently had sent the sevenvehicle convoy along the road without 
him the sources said 
the attackers escaped 
military headquarters in kampala ordered local journalists not 
to report the mutiny and several people were detained in the 
capital for discussing it publicly the sources said 
the sources said they belong to a group of dissident officers 
who want museveni to hold peace talks with several rebel armies 
improve conditions for soldiers and expel 100 libyan and 250 north 
korean military instructors from the former british colony in east 
africa 
they said the mutiny and ambush were aimed at toppling museveni 
the military command in kampala contacted by telephone from 
nairobi would not confirm or deny the reports 
telephones at state house alternately went unanswered or were 
busy 
no previous attempts to assassinate museveni have been reported 
museveni seized power jan 27 1986 ending a fiveyear bush war 
against civilian president milton obote and the military junta that 
ousted obote in july 1985 
the sources said the captives had not been illtreated and would 
be sent to reeducation camps at entebbe kyankwanzi west of 
kampala and mobuku near the zaire border the government set up the 
camps to screen surrendering rebels before they are absorbed into 
the army or allowed to return to civilian life 
soldiers loyal to obote and other toppled ugandan leaders 
including military dictator idi amin have mounted insurgencies 
since august 1986 and musevenis national resistance army has been 
battling several rebel groups 
on saturday museveni signed a peace agreement with the 
commander of the largest rebel group lt col john angelo okello 
of the northernbased uganda peoples democratic army but eric 
otema allimadi the rebels leader in exile in london rejected the 
accord in advance 
museveni envoys are trying to negotiate a similar agreement with 
a smaller rebel group fighting in the east the uganda peoples 
army

the first apparent example of an 
einstein ring a celestial illusion predicted by the famed 
physicist more than 50 years ago has been discovered by 
astronomers 
they found an elliptical ring they believe occurs because radio 
waves are bent by the gravity of a distant cosmic object the 
discovery reported today in the british journal nature was made 
by jacqueline n hewitt of massachusetts institute of technology 
and other radio astronomers 
the scientists believe the sighting is another example of a 
gravitational lens 
during the past decade several other celestial mirages have 
been spotted a galaxy relatively close to earth acts as a lens 
bending the light emitted by a more distant object in most of the 
other examples the result has been the appearance of two objects 
where only one actually exists 
however the latest probable gravitational lens is bending radio 
waves rather than light into a ring 
albert einstein speculated in 1936 that such things exist but 
are too small to see that was before the development of radio 
astronomy 
hewitts discovery was made with the national radio astronomy 
observatorys vla or very large array telescope near socorro 
nm it was based on observations in 1986 and 1987

a sevenweek hunt for the abominable snowman in 
the wilds of tibet yielded strange footprints in the snow and the 
remains of two skinned sheep but no proof that the mythical apeman 
exists 
a sixman expedition explored the 23237foot menglungtse 
summit where british explorer eric shipton took his famous 
photograph of a fourtoed footprint in 1951 
since shiptons photograph there have been scores of alleged 
sightings of a fearsome hairy beast known both as yeti and the 
abominable snowman with the characteristics of neanderthal man 
but chris bonington 53 leader of the expedition told a news 
conference wednesday theres certainly not any conclusive 
evidence one way or another that the legendary apeman exists 
in a london radio interview bonington said the teams main 
evidence consists of the skins of two mountain sheep known as 
bharals that were found at 17000 feet 
the skins seemed to have been ripped cleanly off the sheep in a 
manner inconsistent with any of its known predators 
bonington said tibetans pass through the area where the skins 
were found but not at this time of year in addition the tibetans 
would have taken the skins because of their value he said 
he said one member of his team also found a very very good 
very clearly distinct line of tracks that seemed to be of a biped 
the team is waiting for the film to be developed 
adding to the mystery was the sighting by british broadcasting 
corp film producer john davidson of a dark figure at about 1000 
feet 
my first impression was that it was probably a bear 
bonington said but it didnt act like one 
finally team members said they could not explain what happened 
to ski poles that vanished after andy fanshawe 25 and alan 
hinkes 34 buried them under a heavy pile of rocks 
the team has turned over its evidence to londons natural 
history museum for scientific tests

the rate of leukemia among young people living 
near a nuclear complex in a barren area of northern scotland is 
nearly twice britains national rate a report published today says 
the report by the governmentsponsored committee on medical 
aspects of radiation in the environment says six known cases of 
leukemia were diagnosed among young people under 24 who lived 
within 15 miles of the plant in dounreay between 1968 and 1984 
this is twice the number expected on the basis of the national 
rate the report says adding that the likelihood of such a high 
rate occurring by chance is about one in 12 
five of the victims lived within 78 miles of the nuclear 
complex the center for britains fastbreeder reactor research 
program the study says 
the report says the reason for the number of leukemia cases is 
not known though the findings echo a 1986 government investigation 
showing the childhood leukemia rate near the sellafield nuclear 
reprocessing plant in cumbria northwest england to be four times 
the national average 
it is hard to imagine that you could see an excess around 
dounreay and an excess around sellafield and it is just bad 
luck said commission chairman martin bobrow 
the committee said it was conceivable that minute amounts of 
radioactive material carried home may accumulate and lead to 
exposure of infants in some unforeseen way 
but it said the level of leukemia might also be due to exposure 
to chemicals viruses or even chance 
scottish health minister michael forsyth said the government had 
accepted the committees recommendation to hold an investigation 
into the high rates despite thesmall number of cases involved 
however union spokesman bryan durrans of the institute of 
professional civil servants called the report inconclusive 
if most of us thought anything was likely to happen to our 
children or families we would not be here he said 
the dounreay complex employs 2100 workers in a barren area of 
northern scotland that offers little alternative employment 
the environmental group friends of the earth lauded the report 
as the first government admission of a link between leukemia and 
nuclear emissions and called for an immediate closure of both the 
dounreay and sellafield plants 
the nuclear industry has finally been implicated in causing 
cancers something it has denied for years said spokesman 
stewart boyle 
leukemia clusters occurrences of the disease statistically 
higher than normal have also been found in southern england near 
the atomic weapons research establishment the royal ordnance 
factory and the uk atomic energy authority 
in each case scientists in the nuclear industry argued that 
recorded emissions of radiation were not high enough to account for 
higher rates of the radiationlinked disease 
the national leukemia rate is eight cases per 100000 people

france will wipe out a third of the debt owed to it 
by the worlds poorest nations and has proposed that the worlds 
six other major industrial powers do the same an aide to president 
francois mitterrand said 
mitterrand set out his proposal in a letter sent to the six 
other leaders with whom he will be meeting at the toronto economic 
summit june 1921 special counselor jacques attali said wednesday 
it has never been so urgent and so necessary to act to help 
the countries of the third world while the gap between rich 
countries and poor countries continues to grow mitterrand wrote 
excerpts of the letter were made public by his office 
mitterrand president reagan and the leaders of canada britain 
west germany italy and japan will be present for the annual 
threeday meeting 
france is proposing that the seven summit nations agree to take 
one of three approaches 
consolidate existing debt at market rates of interest but 
extend repayments over 25 years rather than the current norm of 20 
years 
consolidate the debt at a preferential interest rate of no 
more than half the market rate but with repayments over about 15 
years 
forgive onethird of the total public or governmentguaranteed 
commercial debt with the rest consolidated at normal market terms 
its a very new procedure attali said with its menu of 
options it gives us reason to hope for a consensus 
whether or not the summit partners agree france intends to go 
ahead with the first option wiping out onethird of the debt 
attali refused to specify how much money was involved beyond 
saying the amount is not just in the hundreds of millions of 
francs at current exchange rates 100 million francs is about 
172 million 
he declined to identify the countries that would be eligible 
saying only that they numbered about 20 to qualify a nation must 
be extremely poor deeply in debt and in the process of improving 
the management of its economy he said 
among frances biggest debtors are its former african colonies 
the mitterrand plan would not apply to the worlds most indebted 
nations such as mexico and brazil because they are not among the 
poorest the president said such countries must also be aided with 
new resources and inventive techniques 
attali said france will be represented in toronto by mitterrand 
and finance minister pierre beregovoy

a peace convoy was stalled at the 
mexican border by trade restrictions but organizers say the 41 
vehicles carrying food and medical supplies for nicaragua wont 
budge until they are allowed to cross the rio grande 
right now were prepared to stay here until we are allowed to 
leave our own country said gerry condon one of the nearly 100 
participants in the veterans peace convoy to nicaragua 
we feel like we are being held hostage with this humanitarian 
aid 
the group held a closed meeting wednesday night at its laredo 
campground base to plan actions that would be dramatic that 
would up the ante said condon a vietnam veteran from santa 
cruz calif 
they marched wednesday through nuevo laredo mexico just across 
the river carrying signs and chanting slogans then briefly 
blocked one of the international bridges with mexican supporters 
new york lawyer stephen somerstein traveling with the convoy 
said attorneys with the new yorkbased center for constitutional 
rights are representing the convoy in its negotiations with the 
treasury department 
somerstein said he expected demonstrations of support around the 
country including a protest planned today at the federal building 
in san francisco 
convoy organizers who oppose the us governments trade 
restrictions against nicaragua and aid to the contras who have 
fought to overthrow the leftist government had planned to cross 
the mexican border wednesday morning 
they had hoped to reach nicaragua on june 18 
but on tuesday night federal officials advised them that 
although the food clothing and medical supplies would be allowed 
to be taken to nicaragua the vehicles they planned to leave in the 
central american nation for distribution of the aid would violate a 
trade embargo 
the nicaraguan trade control regulations of the treasury 
departments office of foreign assets control prohibit the 
unlicensed export of goods to nicaragua except for donated 
articles such as food clothing and medicine intended to be used 
to relieve human suffering 
in order to take the five buses and 36 trucks and cars to 
nicaragua the treasury department said the convoy would have to 
post bonds equal to the value of the vehicles as assurance that 
they would be returned to this country 
the group also would have to return them to the united states 
within 30 days or face forfeiture of the bonds and other federal 
penalties under the international emergency economic powers act 
according to a notice the department gave to convoy members 
we do not plan to bring them the vehicles back said 
convoy member dave silk from stonington conn thats part of 
our humanitarian aid 
convoy organizers say the vehicles are needed in nicaragua so 
private relief agencies can distribute the donations the 150 tons 
of aid including food concentrated milk diapers hospital beds 
toys and bicycles is for children they said 
customs officials said they took the initiative tuesday night to 
tell the convoy about the regulations and maintained that the 
group was not being harassed 
its a very usual ordinary and customary procedure said 
charles conroy a customs spokesman in houston all they are 
doing is going through our usual export control procedure 
the convoy started may 21 from points in the west coast the 
rockies midwest and east coast 
by the time it reached the border tuesday night it included 55 
veterans from world war ii korea and vietnam as well as 39 
supporters 
as long as the reagan administration wants to have veterans 
sitting here with baby food on the border thats how long well be 
here said condon

residency program at the university of illinois medical schools 
hospital

her 
ms hudsonwhite said she was separated and living with her 
children in 1974 when she decided to resume her studies 
being a doctor has always been a goal she said wednesday

enough for food and used furniture ms hudsonwhite got a 
fellowship to cover her tuition 
in 1979 she earned a bachelors degree and in 1981 a masters 
degree in biology from chicago state university then she began 
applying to medical schools in illinois and surrounding states

at first i thought i was too old she said but my medical 
college admissions test scores werent as good as they could have 
been 
she took the test again in 1982 improving her scores and 
reapplied to the 20 schools this time most accepted her

iraq said today its warplanes hit a ship 
off irans persian gulf coast during the night and iran said its 
interceptors shot down an iraqi jet in a dogfight over the waterway 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia said one civilian was killed and six wounded when iraq 
planes bombed a village near sardasht in northwestern azerbaijan 
province wednesday 
the agency said the frenchbuilt iraqi mirage f1 was shot down 
and exploded over the gulf 
there was no confirmation from baghdad but the official iraqi 
news agency reported that iraqi helicopter gunships shot down an 
iranian bell 214 helicopter today over the northern sector of the 
gulf war battlefront 
baghdad radio monitored in nicosia quoted a military 
communique as saying iraq fighterbombers carried out the 
accurate and effective shipping raid wednesday night 
it did not identify the vessel and there was no immediate 
independent confirmation of the attack from shipping sources 
the official radio said the attack was carried out as part of 
iraqs campaign to choke off irans vital oil exports on which 
tehran depends to bankroll its war effort 
the two countries have been at war for nearly eight years 
the iraqis claimed to have hit another ship in the tanker 
holding area near irans kharg island oil terminal june 4 but 
there has been no independent confirmation of that attack either 
the last confirmed iraqi air strike against shipping in the gulf 
was may 16 when fighterbombers attacked the 112445ton iranian 
tanker bisoton 
the bisoton was formerly the norwegianowned mia margrethe 
which was hit by two iranian gunboats in the southern gulf last 
june 26 and set on fire 
about 500 merchant ships have been attacked by both sides in the 
socalled tanker war that began in early 1984 more than 300 
seamen have been killed

blacks returned to work and 
school today after more than 2 million stayed away for three days 
to protest curbs on antiapartheid activity and legislative 
proposals to limit the right to strike 
organizers called the nations longest and largest general 
strike a success and the white minority governments manpower 
minister said he might delay action on the proposed labor 
legislation 
employers estimated that the strike cost the economy 250 
million 
downtown johannesburg which had been relatively deserted was 
bustling again for the first time this week fleets of minibus 
taxis arrived carrying workers from the huge black township of 
soweto 
in durban the port city where the strike was most effective 
transport companies said ridership on commuter trains and buses 
remained 20 percent below normal officials suggested some blacks 
feared it was unsafe to return to work because commuter buses had 
been stoned and firebombed during the strike 
police said three men were stabbed to death by other blacks 
during the night at riverview in natal province there was an 
unconfirmed report that a fourth man was killed there today when a 
mine in his possession exploded 
eight other killings were reported earlier this week in natal 
where groups supporting and opposing the protest clashed two 
people were killed in unrest elsewhere during the strike 
black labor federations backed by prominent clergymen 
organized the strike to protest restrictions put on antiapartheid 
groups feb 24 and proposed legislation that would limit the right 
of unions to strike 
todays editions of the financial newspaper business day quoted 
manpower minister pieter du plessis as saying he planned to send a 
formal invitation to black labor leaders to meet with him 
du plessis also offered to suspend action on certain clauses of 
the labor bill if the unions could convince him this was warranted 
business day said 
to antiapartheid activists the protest was a success because 
it took place without overt help from the restricted opposition 
groups 
the stayaway is an indication of the determination of the 
people to oppose the apartheid government said the rev frank 
chikane general secretary of the south african council of 
churches it means the february restrictions have not suppressed 
the spirit of resistance 
security forces maintained a relatively low profile during the 
protest and government officials made virtually no public 
statements about it but employers threatened to reduce work forces 
and move toward mechanization if political strikes continue 
black miners virtually ignored the strike and kept the nations 
most lucrative industry operating almost normally despite support 
for the protest by the national union of mineworkers leadership 
mining produces 80 percent of south africas export earnings 
including the neartotal boycott of urban black schools the 
number of participants each day appeared to have exceeded 2 million 
the number of people who stayed home june 16 1986 to protest the 
nationwide state of emergency imposed four days earlier 
president pw botha declared the emergency to combat a black 
uprising against apartheid the racial policy that preserves power 
for south africas 5 million whites and denies the 26 million 
blacks a voice in national affairs 
it is expected to be renewed this week for a third year the 
state of emergency gives police sweeping powers of detention 
without trial imposes press restrictions and outlaws several forms 
of peaceful protest 
police told news media this week it was illegal under emergency 
regulations to report on the extent of a general strike 
such reports were carried by progovernment newspapers and the 
staterun broadcasting company along with other media but many 
accounts were worded cautiously and avoided positive assessments of 
the strike

rebellion hospital officials said israeli soldiers shot and killed 
a 17yearold arab in a clash 
meanwhile israeli physicians accused the army of causing 
paralyzing injuries by using powerful highspeed bullets to 
disperse demonstrators 
seventeenyearold ahmed hassan hawari died after he was shot in 
the head during a confrontation with troops in sebastiya near 
nablus in the west bank said officials at ittihad hospital in 
nablus 
an 18yearold youth and a 12yearold girl were shot and 
wounded when soldiers fired at protesters in the west bank town of 
tulkarem officials at the tulkarem and nablus hospitals said both 
were shot in the legs 
another seven tulkarem residents were treated for cuts inflicted 
by rubber bullets the hospital official said 
an israeli military spokesman said the army was checking the 
reports 
since the antioccupation unrest began dec 8 in the lands 
israel seized in the 1967 middle east war 203 palestinians and two 
israelis have been killed more than 5000 arabs have been wounded 
or injured and 5000 are in jail 
underground leaders of the palestine liberation organization 
ordered todays general strike stores were closed workers stayed 
home public transportation was paralyzed and many children stayed 
home from school 
men with kafiyeh headresses wrapped around their faces went into 
schools in the west bank and encouraged children to leave classes 
and demonstrate israeli army radio said 
an underground leaflet calling for the general strike urged 
children to stay out of schools which have opened in recent weeks 
after a fourmonth shutdown ordered by israeli military authorities 
the army clamped curfews on about 110000 palestinians in 
villages or refugee camps they included the jabaliya refugee camp 
in gaza which has been under curfew for a week and the west bank 
village of janiya and beit ur et tahta where attackers hurled 
firebombs at two israeli vehicles overnight 
two army officers suffered minor injuries when their jeep was 
hit by a firebomb and set ablaze in janiya the army said 
six israeli doctors said in a report on military action in the 
gaza strip that the army should not disperse protesters with 
highvelocity bullets of the type used in the m16 automatic rifle 
the report said such bullets produced 13 paraplegics and two 
quadaplegics and caused 20 cases of serious internal injuries 
it also accused the army of misusing tear gas by firing into 
enclosed areas failing to keep proper records of injuries and 
failing to carry out autopsies in unexplained deaths 
in some cases the army transferred seriously injured people to 
israeli hospitals to interrogate them thereby exposing them to 
increased risk the report charged 
a military spokesman denied most of the charges in the medical 
report and said the army never gives out information about the 
types of ammunition it uses 
transfer to hospitals in israel is done solely in order to 
give the patient better treatment that is not available in gaza 
hospitals the spokesman said on condition of anonymity it is 
done for only humanitarian reasons 
he said the army frequently does not conduct autopsies because 
arab families oppose them and regularly take away and bury the 
bodies of relatives before autopsies can be performed 
the team of doctors organized by leftwing parliament member 
dedi zucker said it could not determine whether tear gas causes 
miscarriages palestinian women have charged they suffered 
miscarriages after being exposed to tear gas in enclosed spaces 
the physicians did report that a 35yearold pregnant womans 
fetus died after troops twice accidentally fired tear gas into her 
home 
two elderly women suffered a heart attack and a paralyzing 
stroke after being exposed to tear gas in a closed area the report 
said 
we deny altogether that the army uses tear gas incorrectly or 
that it causes miscarriage said the army spokesman who said the 
tear gas was tested for side effects but he said there may be 
specific cases where for example tear gas penetrate a home by 
accident 
the report described as a preliminary study was based on 
interviews with arab physicians and medical officers for the armys 
administration in the gaza strip

three mistakes in two days by air traffic 
controllers at ohare international airport prompted federal safety 
officials to begin an investigation of the system for directing 
planes in the area officials said 
officials at the national transportation safety board were 
alarmed because controllers made two errors monday and one tuesday 
raising to 20 the number of mistakes theyve made at the nations 
second busiest airport this year said mike benson an agency 
spokesman 
the significant increase in operational errors from 12 in all 
of last year to 20 already this year set off concern for us 
benson said wednesday 
benson said four investigators would arrive in chicago possibly 
today their investigation initially will focus on controllers in 
ohares radar room where most of the mistakes have been made 
benson said 
the federal aviation administration plans to send three safety 
specialists to assist and allow the faa to take immediate action 
if any discrepancies are uncovered faa administrator t allan 
mcartor said 
the faa also said it has assigned eight additional airtraffic 
controllers to help overworked controllers at ohare during the 
busy summer season the washington post reported today 
controllers in the radar room are in charge of routing air 
traffic in a 30mile radius of ohare while controllers in the 
tower primarily direct landings and takeoffs benson said 
last year controllers in ohares radar room made nine of the 
12 operational errors he said this year the radar room has been 
responsible for 15 of the 20 mistakes including the three this 
week benson said 
mondays first error involved a united airlines jetliner bound 
for ontario calif and a lear jet benson said 
after takeoff radar records showed that the boeing 727 
carrying 128 passengers came within 1200 feet of the other plane 
said dan sheehy a united spokesman 
such incidents are not classified as nearcollisions unless the 
aircraft come within less than 500 feet of each other 
sheehy said the united pilot did not file a nearcollision 
report but the company was investigating the incident 
our captain did not take any evasive action because there was 
no reason to there was enough separation between the planes 
sheehy said 
but the pilot of the lear jet filed a nearcollision report 
said agency spokesman mort edelstein 
later monday radar room controllers were blamed for an error 
involving united flight 608 a boeing 727 bound for washington and 
a cessna 172 airplane said sheehy and benson 
tuesdays error involved an american airlines dc10 and a midway 
airlines boeing 737 benson said he said he could provide no other 
details 
the ntsb team will begin by investigating the three errors and 
then interview the controllers involved in this years other 
mistakes he said 
then they will interview a crosssection of controllers and 
examine programs that influence their job performance such as 
training quality assurance and amount of overtime worked 
the national air traffic controllers association based in 
washington said ohare like other airports nationwide is plagued 
by short staffing and overworked controllers 
we would welcome any type of outside oversight right now 
said john thornton the groups national coordinator around the 
country were seeing short staffs equipment problems and sometimes 
an insensitivity on the part of the faa to resolve these problems 
during the past several years the faas airtraffic control 
operations at ohare have been scrutinized by the safety board and 
congess because of the airports congested skies and a shortage of 
fully trained controllers

is honesty still the best policy 
only if you talk to the right bureaucrat 
consider the case of peter elia of mendham township who during 
one recent morning rush found a cashiers check for 10000 on the 
floor of a commuter train station not far from this new york city 
suburb 
an amazing stroke of luck but not for elia who spent the 
better part of his day trying to return the check to its owner 
elia 36 said he made several calls to chemical bank in new 
york which had issued the check but nobody at the bank would take 
responsibility for finding its owner 
they switched me to about eight different branches he said 
amazingly one guy even told me how to cash it 
but elia perservered finally taking the check to the new york 
post which contacted chemical bank officials 
the bank issued a redfaced apology to elia a merchandising 
manager for kinney shoes in manhattan 
i certainly extend our apologies to mr elia bank spokesman 
kenneth herz said we very much appreciate what he did

muhammad ali says he must take medication 
every three hours to relieve some of the symptoms of parkinsons 
syndrome but he insists he is not braindamaged and his slurred 
speech comes from fear of crowds 
its unfortunate that people have an image of me as a 
legendary figure and if they see me as anything less than 
superman they cant accept it he said in an interview published 
today in the washington post 
the former threetime heavyweight champion said he is frustrated 
that he cant demonstrate to people that he is not braindamaged 
and that he is hurt when people talk about him in his presence as 
if he doesnt understand them 
i bet youre surprised im talking this good ali said to a 
post reporter during the telephone interview see im not 
stupid im not braindamaged the mind is good the difference 
now is that i dont feel so crowded 
when its crowded i feel pressure and i just cant project 
he said 
ali was in washington to attend a capitol hill news conference 
tuesday to announce the appointment of a friend stephen saltzburg 
to a justice department post 
doctors have said alis illness is a progressive neurological 
degeneration related to parkinsons disease that was caused by 
blows he suffered during his boxing career parkinsons disease is 
a potentially fatal condition that causes gradual loss of muscle 
control sometimes leading to the slurred speech that has been the 
source of rumors about ali being braindamaged 
ali said the medication he takes every three hours makes a 
real difference in how he feels he wouldnt discuss the 
treatment in detail but said his speech shows it if he deviates 
from the regimen 
god gave me this physical impairment to remind me that i am 
not the greatest he is he said 
during the wideranging interview ali also spoke of jesse 
jacksons presidential campaign and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
i like jesse but i think his timings off he said 
he needs to prove that he is not just a cheerleader he should 
run for office and get himself elected governor or senator i think 
its too big a responsibility for him to be the leader of the free 
world right out of the starting gate 
about gorbachev ali said if its all a show hes a better 
actor than ronald reagan

a navy investigator has begun 
deliberating on whether five swimming instructors and a commanding 
officer should be courtmartialed for a recruits death during a 
training program 
a navy prosecutor contended wednesday in his closing arguments 
that the use of force to stop airman recruit lee mirecki from 
quitting the elite rescue swimmer training program was a crime 
these men were not malicious they were hardened said lt 
cmdr larry d wynne in his closing arguments they were not 
vicious they were indifferent they saw saw but did not 
perceive 
five of mireckis instructors at the pensacola naval air station 
rescue swimmer school and its commanding officer should be 
courtmartialed wynne contended as attorneys concluded their cases 
in the fourday investigative hearing 
cmdr daniel j dalesio jr the investigator will make a 
recommendation on the courtmartial charges to rear adm david 
morris chief of naval air training at a later date 
morris based in corpus christi texas has 120 days after the 
may 10 filing of the charges to begin courtmartial proceedings if 
that is his choice other options are nonjudicial punishment or 
dismissal of the charges 
the 19yearold recruit from appleton wis died march 2 after 
allegedly being forced back into a pool when he tried to quit 
during a drill 
a pathologist testified that mirecki who suffered heart failure 
before he drowned had a phobia about being pulled under water and 
literally was scared to death classmates were ordered to turn 
their backs on the pool and sing the national anthem before mirecki 
collapsed witnesses said 
the instructors charged with involuntary manslaughter are petty 
officers 1st class richard e blevins and david j smith and petty 
officers 2nd class frankie d deaton john w zelenock and michael 
w combe 
lt thomas a torchia the officer in charge of the school is 
accused of dereliction of duty 
mirecki had a right to quit and the uniform code of military 
justice prohibited the use of force against him wynne said 
defense lawyers argued that pushing scared exhausted or 
malingering trainees into the pool or pulling them off its walls 
was an accepted practice this is the navy said lt julie l 
hoving deatons lawyer the students must be forced to their 
limits 
she and other defense counsel contended that failure to use 
force to simulate the stress of an actual rescue in bad weather or 
combat situation would not adequately prepare students and could 
endanger them and those they are trying to save 
wynne said torchia was in his office overlooking the pool 100 
feet away when mirecki was being pushed in he contended the 
officer could see and hear what was happening but did nothing 
torchias lawyers introduced a report on a lie detector test 
indicating he was telling the truth when he said he was taking a 
telephone call from headquarters in washington and neither saw nor 
heard what was going on 
witnesses testified mirecki had tried to quit training a month 
before he died and subsequently was classified by a flight surgeon 
as unfit to continue because he had a phobia about being dragged 
under water 
a clinical psychologist disagreed with the finding and mirecki 
was returned to training through a series of errors without 
obtaining a required physical examination and a flight surgeons 
approval witnesses said

an amish convict must submit to an id 
photograph despite objections on religious grounds a federal 
appeals court has ruled 
the 8th circuit us court of appeals on wednesday upheld a 
lower court ruling in the case of andy slabaugh of canton minn 
who was charged in 1986 with offering an irs agent a 500 bribe 
federal marshals were required to photograph him at the time of 
prisoner processing 
slabaugh however cited the biblical commandment against the 
making of graven images and argued that his appearance was 
distinctive enough to make a photo unnecessary he has one arm and 
wears a long beard and plain amish dress 
the picturetaking was delayed until the court could hold a 
hearing before the hearing could be held he pleaded guilty and 
was placed on three years probation 
a us district court later ruled that the government had a 
compelling publicsafety interest that overrode slabaughs right to 
free exercise of religion 
the appeals court affirmed the ruling but said that because 
slabaugh had pleaded guilty the lower court needed only to find 
that the photograph had a reasonable relationship to the 
purposes of the probation law 
scott tilsen a public defender who represented slabaugh said 
he will appeal to the us supreme court

a federal health official said today that 
national distribution of a pamphlet on aids has dramatically 
increased calls to aids hotlines but he acknowledged that not all 
of them are giving callers the same answers 
dr james mason director of the centers for disease control in 
atlanta said calls on the centers spanishlanguage hotline have 
risen from about 20 a day before may 26 when the mass mailing 
began to almost 6000 a day now 
one day last week there were 17000 calls on all the centers 
hotlines compared to about 6000 a day before the mailing to 107 
million us households he said 
meanwhile a congressional report released wednesday said 
substantial misconceptions remain about aids and witnesses 
told a panel that efforts to educate the public are often bogged 
down in red tape 
mason interviewed on cbs this morning said it is 
understandable that callers to the literally hundreds of 
hotlines around the country are getting different answers on some 
aspects of the disease 
we need to do everything we can to standardize those answers 
and were doing that but that youre getting a few different 
answers is not really surprising mason said 
he said the cdc has put out a list of 30 standard questions and 
answers about the disease but it does not cover every conceivable 
situation that callers might raise 
mason said hotlines run by state health agencies and most 
community hotlines are reliable but if callers want to be 
sure he said they should call federal or state government 
hotlines 
a philadelphia city official testifying before congress said 
bureaucracy has become a major enemy of cities trying to fight 
the aids epidemic and singer dionne warwick said the aids 
information pamphlet distributed by the federal government to every 
household is no panacea 
regrettably perhaps the most important people that we need to 
reach to stem the spread did not receive these brochures or if 
they did simply ignored them and never read them miss warwick 
told the senate governmental affairs committee at a hearing 
wednesday 
miss warwick has begun a foundation to award grants to community 
groups for aids education programs especially those targeted at 
minorities that are disproportionately affected by the disease 
a study released at the hearing by the congressional office of 
technology assessment found that the general population continues 
to hold substantial misconceptions about how the aids virus is 
transmitted 
these include believing one can become infected by donating 
blood or by working near someone with the virus the study said 
still ota said education through the mass media can change 
behavior as shown in campaigns to stop people from smoking the 
agency also noted that dramatic behavioral change has occurred 
among homosexual males in response to the aids epidemic 
david fair executive assistant to the health commissioner for 
aids programs in philadelphia told the panel that three aids 
testing and counseling centers have not yet opened because 800000 
in federal money the city expected to receive last september has 
become entangled in bureaucracy 
the problem he said lies in philadelphias reliance on the 
state government which distributes the federal money to cities 
they hold up they play that kind of politics even though its 
an aids situation committee chairman john glenn dohio asked 
absolutely fair replied the reference that i use when 
talking to state legislators is that aids is not a weatherization 
project they need to treat it a little bit differently 
asked by glenn whether the pennsylvania case was common alan 
hinman of the federal center for prevention services said not 
every state has problems getting funds out but there are problems 
yes 
gary noble deputy director for aids at the federal centers for 
disease control said the agency is reexamining the criteria for 
distributing money to large cities where acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome is most prevalent 
cdc staff levels present another problem michael zimmerman of 
the general accounting office said 
the staff assigned by cdc to manage its aids education efforts 
appears to be insufficient to monitor state and local health 
departments and advise them on how to develop and operate effective 
aids education programs he said 
aids a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system is spread most often through sexual contact needles shared 
by drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from 
infected pregnant women to their offspring

the owners of a restaurant are having 
a food fight with the health department over when exactly 
leftovers become leftovers 
saginaw county health officials have ordered the bavarian inn to 
stop serving food left on its platters to employees 
as of tuesday everything is going down the drain like they 
say it has to said don keller the restaurants marketing and 
sales director the restaurant faced revocation of its license if 
it didnt comply 
the owners admitted to health inspectors during an inspection in 
april that they reserved food to employees a violation of state 
law officials said 
keller said the law is not properly written for familystyle 
restaurants such as the bavarian inn where food is served on 
platters that diners pass around the table 
we agree it would be revolting to take food off someone elses 
plate keller said but we are saying it isnt served until it 
goes on the customers plate the health department is saying once 
it leaves the kitchen it is served 
we are quietly trying to figure out some way this good food 
can be used again keller said

autonomous soviet republic northeast of leningrad foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady i gerasimov told reporters at a news briefing 
the selection of yeltsin could make for lively debate if he 
speaks at the conference which runs from june 28 to july 1 
yeltsin 57 was fired as moscow party boss and stripped of his 
post as a nonvoting member of the countrys ruling politburo 
because of an angry speech he gave last october 
in the speech to the partys policymaking central committee 
yeltsin criticized the no 2 man in the soviet leadership yegor k 
ligachev and complained that reforms were moving too slowly 
he gave several interviews to western television networks last 
week solidifying his reputation for speaking his mind freely about 
controversial matters in one interview he called for ligachev to 
resign because he said ligachev was blocking reforms 
gerasimov said there was no requirement in party rules that a 
conference delegate live or work in the area he is chosen to 
represent yeltsin lives in moscow where his current job is first 
deputy chairman of the state building committee

the party conference is shaping up to be a battleground for 
supporters of gorbachevs social and economic reforms known as 
perestroika and the midlevel managers who resist him 
tatyana zaslavskaya a prominent soviet sociologist has said 
the most pronounced advocates of perestroika were not selected 
as conference delegates 
the newspaper of the moscow city party moskovskaya pravda 
complained today that election of the candidates not everywhere 
has been conducted in the atmosphere of wide glasnost 
gorbachevs policy of openness on selected issues 
the newspaper said the nominating procedure should be changed 
because some party and nonparty members could not speak out 
their opinions 
the conference the first of its kind in 47 years will review 
proposals to consolidate political changes favored by gorbachev 
including limits on terms for party officials 
according to party sources there will be about one delegate for

house speaker jim wright said today he is 
supremely confident allegations against him will be put to rest 
once the house ethics committee hears his answer to charges he 
violated conflictofinterest rules through a book contract and 
lobbying for oil companies 
wright dtexas said he was filing a brief with the committee 
today and was preparing a narrative to release to the public but 
he had not yet been asked to appear before the panel 
i am supremely confident when all of it is seen out on the 
table in the sunlight it will be abolutely clear to everyone that 
no rules were violated wright told reporters 
the committee today holds its second meeting to review the case 
against wright and set the scope of its inquiry rep newt 
gingrich rga who filed the complaint against wright has also 
asked the panel to hire an independent counsel for the probe 
gingrich a political foe of the speaker charged that wright 
had a financial stake when he lobbied us and foreign officials on 
behalf of oil companies and when he accepted an unusually 
lucrative royalty contract from a friend and campaign contractor 
who published his last book 
common cause a nonprofit group which pushes for tighter 
government ethics standards also has called for an ethics 
investigation 
i believe i can put all the allegations to rest said 
wright if the committee will give priority into looking at each 
and every charge it will discover i have violated no rule 
and certainly violated no commonly accepted ethical standard 
i would like for it to be done at the earliest possible 
time he said however the ethics committee had not yet asked 
him to appear he said 
wright chairman of next months democratic national convention 
was asked if the party was concerned that his troubles might hurt 
chances of regaining the white house in the fall 
i havent heard that concern expressed he said adding that 
anyone who was so concerned should come and see him the speaker 
and other democratic leaders have said wright is a victim of a gop 
effort to distract attention from ethical lapses in the reagan 
administration 
privately wrights aides said they were frustrated with the 
slow pace of the ethics committee probe 
the committee held its first meeting on the case a week ago 
since that meeting it has been reported that wrights book a 
collection of his stories and sayings was completed with the help 
of one of his capitol hill staff who took a taxpayerfinanced trip 
to texas to do some of the work 
gingrich subsequently conceded that one of his aides helped him 
with a book 
wright is working on another book with help from one of his 
assistants but the aide says this work is being done in his spare 
time 
the ethics committee officially called the committee on 
standards of official conduct is the only house panel with equal 
representation of the two parties with six democrats and six

central american leaders oppose the use of military force to oust 
panamas gen manuel antonio noriega 
my conviction is that only through persuasion can noreiga be 
removed arias said at the statehouse after a meeting with gov 
michael s dukakis the likely democratic presidential nominee 
noriega under indictment in the united states on drug charges 
has held on to power in the panama despite us sanctions and 
protests at home 
i dont think any latin american country would be in favor of 
a military solution of military pressure of economic sanctions 
said arias who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts to bring 
peace to central america 
they hurt the panamanian people not necessarily the 
government we must reach a diplomatic solution and we would 
never be in favor of military pressure 
arias met with dukakis before attending the harvard university 
commencement at which he was to deliver a speech and receive an 
honorary degree

thousands of radical students armed 
with clubs rocks and firebombs and screaming yankee go home 
stormed into the streets today and battled riot police who blasted 
them with tear gas 
the vicious street fighting occurred around yonsei university 
where roughly 20000 students had gathered for a march friday to 
communist north korea to press for unification of the divided 
peninsula 
korea was split into the communist north and prowestern south 
in 1945 
students clashed with riot police in at least eight provincial 
cities when authorities tried to block marches in support of 
fridays march or tried to stop radicals going to seoul 
riot troopers guarded government buildings and diplomatic posts 
in seoul to prevent student attacks hundreds of police ringed the 
us embassy 
in seoul police armored vans fired hundreds of tear gas bombs 
into the charging students as special martial arts squads tried to 
hold the protesters off at least a dozen riot policemen were 
engulfed in orange flames after being hit by firebombs 
scores of police and protesters were injured in the fighting 
the students had surged out the schools main gates to attack 
police after they heard the sound of fighting in nearby streets 
where cordons of riot police were trying to turn away students 
attempting to reach the campus 
down with the military dictatorship and march to north 
korea students yelled as they pelted the lines of riot police 
with rocks and bricks 
police trying to fend off the attacks with shields hurled 
rocks and bricks as well as tear gas grenades at the charging 
protesters 
masked students repeatedly ran right up to the police lines to 
hurl firebombs at close range officers with fire extinguishers 
doused the blazing clothes of comrades set on fire 
students from dozens of colleges had gathered at yonsei for an 
overnight vigil before trying to march friday to the north korean 
border in efforts to force unification of the divided peninsula 
north koreas official news agency monitored in tokyo said a 
north korean student delegation already had left the capital of 
pyongyang for the border to meet the south korean students and seek 
a breakthrough for peaceful unification 
earlier police had arrested scores of students who were trying 
to reach the yonsei university campus and used tear gas to disperse 
groups of students in nearby side streets 
national police officials in seoul reported that about 25000 
students took part in rallies at 78 colleges nationwide but the 
figure appeared low 
in the southern city of kwangju about 1000 students hurling 
firebombs and rocks attacked riot police when authorities tried to 
stop them leaving for seoul police arrested about 200 students 
students also fought police in suwon taejon taeju mockpo 
chung iri and kyongju 
the government deployed more than 60000 riot police and put all 
security forces on maximum alert to stop fridays planned march to 
the border truce site of panmunjom 30 miles north of seoul 
government leaders said the march was a threat to national 
security and students were playing into the hands of the communist 
north opposition politicians urged the students to cancel the 
march 
in taejon about 5000 people held an anticommunist rally today 
in front of the railway station to urge the students to abandon the 
march 
radical groups claim the united states enforces partition of the 
peninsula and rules the south as a colony their protests have been 
violently antiamerican calling for withdrawal of the 42000 us 
troops in the south 
the students a small but powerful minority claim they are not 
communist but insist korea must be reunited and ideological 
differences are secondary 
president roh taewoo insists all contacts with the north be 
handled by the government he has said he would seek meetings 
between north and south students under proper supervision 
there are no intergovernment unification talks now the last 
contacts between the two sides were in 1985 north korea rejected 
talks in 1986 because of ussouth korean military exercises it 
said was preparation for war 
both sides have proposals on new talks that the other rejects 
north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean war 
and repeatedly has staged terrorist attacks over the years

and the space shuttle has announced it will resume production next 
week 
kerrmcgee corp said wednesday it will resume manufacture of 
ammonium perchlorate monday at its henderson plant which shut down

the oilrich persian gulf states have 
agreed to give the palestine liberation organization a massive 
subsidy to finance the sixmonthold uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories the plo said today 
sources in other delegations at the arab summit said the amount 
may exceed 100 million per year 
earlier saudi arabia and north yemen called on the arab states 
at the summit take egypt back into the arab league but were 
rebuffed by the summit host algeria officials said the league 
expelled egypt after it signed a peace accord with israel in 1979 
the summit due to close later in the day was called primarily 
to discuss the palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip more than 200 palestinians have died since the uprising 
began dec 8 two israelis also have died 
plo leader yasser arafat initially asked the summit to provide 
600 million a year he said the revolt cost the plo more than 50 
million a month in relief compensation for wages lost by striking 
palestinians and medical expenses of injured rioters 
the requested sum was reduced following negotiations among an 
eightmember committee of delegation chiefs convened to seek 
agreement on the subsidies as well as payments to jordan and syria 
for costs stemming from the uprising 
the committee included delegates from algeria syria jordan 
the united arab emirates qatar saudi arabia kuwait and the plo 
plo spokesman bassam abu sharif denied news reports the summit 
had rebuffed plo demands for financial support for the uprising 
the most serious challenge to israel since it captured the west 
bank and gaza during the 1967 middle east war 
delegation sources said the gulf states turned down arafats 
initial request claiming funds were limited by instability in the 
world oil market and the effects of the iraniraq war on oil 
exports 
they said the plo later agreed to cut its request to 300 
million to 400 million but delegates of the gulf states said even 
that was too much 
there was no mention of egypt during the first two days of the 
summit but saudi foreign minister saud alfaisal raised the issue 
late wednesday as a ministerial committee was drafting the summits 
final communique 
alfaisal argued that since a majority of the arab nations have 
restored diplomatic ties with egypt it was counterproductive 
to keep the largest and most powerful arab nation outside the arab 
league 
summit delegates speaking on condition of anonymity said 
algeria and the moderate proegyptian majority in the 21member 
league reached a compromise that would pave the way for egypts 
possible readmission to the league at its next regular summit 
scheduled for november in riyad saudi arabia 
but libya and syria maintained their uncompromising opposition 
to egypts readmission the sources said 
after intense backstage discussions algeria and saudi arabia 
agreed to postpone the issue until the riyad summit they said in 
a compromise algeria agreed not to object to a proposal to be 
presented at riyad inviting egyptian hosni mubarak to join the 
meeting 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi and syrian president hafez 
assad said they would continue to oppose the readmission of egypt 
for betraying the arab cause 
gadhafi angered some delegates by telling arab leaders who 
collaborate with the united states that they undermine the arab 
cause and should go to hell he did not refer to any leaders by 
name 
gadhafi wore a white glove on his right hand and one libyan 
delegate said the glove was intended to avoid contact with a hand 
that shook that of israeli foreign minister shimon peres 
moroccos king hassan ii received peres then prime minister in 
july 1986

the chairman of the house space committee is 
criticizing the reagan administration for refusing federal aid for 
the explosiondamaged nevada town which makes a vital component of 
the fuel that powers the nations rockets and the space shuttle 
booster 
rep robert roe dnj asks how the townspeople of henderson 
nev can be expected to drop their opposition to making the 
volatile chemical ammonium perchlorate there at the same time the 
federal goverment turns down a request for disaster assistance 
one of the towns two ammonium perchlorate plants operated by 
pacific engineering and production company exploded on may 4 
killing two people injuring hundreds and causing 73 million in 
damage the second plant operated by kerrmcgee corporation was 
shut down after the explosion reopened briefly and closed again 
after gov richard bryan threatened to sue on grounds that the 
facility was a safety hazard 
a few hours after a hearing by roes investigations subcommittee 
of the house science and technology committee ended wednesday 
kerrmcgee announced in henderson that differences with the clark 
county fire department had been ironed out and that the company 
plans to resume production of ammonium perchlorate next week the 
fire department had found some safety violations and threatened 
action 
together the two plants were the only us source of the 
chemical which is also used in dozens of rockets such as the 
trident peacekeeper minuteman titan and delta 
on wednesday the federal emergency management agency rejected a 
request from bryan for disaster relief for henderson 
why in gods name would we not give them aid roe asked 
its extraordinary to me that here we are looking for the 
cooperation that we need desperately now with the good authorities 
in nevada and we are coming back and saying too bad you can 
rebuild your own libraries rebuild your own schools we want to 
get the most production out of this facility but were not going 
to do anything to help you 
richard truly the head of nasas space shuttle program 
responded that while the probleble of producing 40 
million pounds of a major solid rocket fuel component called 
ammonium perchlorate kerrmcgee can produce 36 million pounds 
the las vegas reviewjournal reported wednesday that the pacific 
engineering plant had been cited by the occupational safety and 
health administration for 123 health and safety violations since 
1974 company spokeswoman connie richardson declined to comment on 
the report 
truly told the house committee that nasa has four sets of 
booster rockets on hand and if the fuel shortage continues next 
year some flights will have to be dropped 
he said morton thiokol which builds the rockets will be in a 
position in midjune to direct pacific engineering to build a new 
facility capable of producing 30 million pounds of fuel a year 
that he said could be accomplished within six months to eight 
months with some added time for testing 
the money for the plant truly said would come from a 5 cents 
per pound surcharge on the fuel the same method might be used to 
expand kerrmcgees facility 
our first and foremost effort truly said must be to 
safely but as quickly as we possibly can to get kerrmcgee 
production back in place we must rebuild our lost capability and 
we have moved out to do so 
the committee was told that demand for ammonium perchlorate 
would rise from 378 million pounds this year to more than 60 
million pounds in 1989 the bulk of the fuel would be used by nasa 
the army navy and air force and the rest for commercial export 
and other uses 
truly also said nasa was weighing options for fixing and using 
six sets of booster rockets remaining from before the challenger 
accident in january 1986 those rockets have the same flaws in the 
joints that doomed the challenger 
we are seriously thinking about how those boosters would be 
used truly said it would be very premature as to what options 
we may have 
each set of shuttle boosters uses 17 million pounds of ammonium 
perchlorate

michael dukakis took his wife home from the hospital met with 
costa rican president oscar arias and got back to work at the 
massachusetts statehouse today in his first day back in boston 
after sewing up the democratic presidential nomination 
his presidential campaign focused on choosing a running mate 
vice president george bush the allbutcertain republican 
nominee was opening his postprimary campaign with a trip to 
texas grateful for new words of support from president reagan who 
said wednesday he would do everything i can to help bush win 
dukakis who has strongly criticized reagan administration 
policies in latin america praised arias peace plan for central 
america and said the united states must develop a new 
relationship based on respect with the regions areas 
arias sidestepped a question about the us elections saying 
only that he would be a good friend of whoever you decide to 
elect in november 
dukakis then went to the hospital where his wife kitty was 
released six days after undergoing spinal surgery 
mrs dukakis wore a neck brace and appeared to be in some pain 
she said her doctors told her she could take the brace off at the 
democratic national convention in july on the night her husband 
formally accepts the nomination 
dukakis whose victories in the final four primaries of the 
season on tuesday gave him the delegates he needs for a 
firstballot victory at the convention received a round of support 
from onetime opponents on wednesday 
rep richard gephardt sen paul simon and former arizona gov 
bruce babbitt all weighed in with endorsements wednesday and new 
york gov mario cuomo the most speculatedabout noncandidate of 
the year finally lent his backing although it wasnt exactly the 
flowery tribute traditionally offered on such occasions 
i endorse him i endorse him i endorse him an exasperated 
cuomo said after persistent questioning by reporters there 
three times i endorsed him 
even though the nomination is numerically his dukakis is still 
engaged in a duel of sorts with jesse jackson the secondplace 
finisher in the primary sweepstakes 
jackson says hell continue his campaign up until the 
convention and he has put dukakis on notice that he wants to be 
offered the no 2 spot on the ticket 
the massachusetts governor has said hell consider jackson as a 
possible running mate but jackson says consideration alone wont 
do it 
consideration means an offer it does not mean just in 
passing he said wednesday the vice presidency is not the top 
but it is a long way from where i started 
dukakis kept to what has become his stock line on the subject 
that jackson himself has said its the nominees decision to make 
im going to cast my net far and wide he said adding that 
he hoped to have a very good idea prior to next months 
convention of whom he wants for a running mate 
jackson was spending a few days at a california resort resting 
and talking to advisers he waged a grueling primary campaign 
seldom missing a day of stumping 
bush on the other hand was heading back out on the trail 
today he was traveling to houston where he was to address the 
texas state gop convention 
like dukakis bush was seeing former rivals line up behind him 
three of them bob dole rep jack kemp and television evangelist 
pat robertson were joining him on friday at a unity 88 
conference in denver 
on wednesday bush met with reagan who pledged afterward he 
would campaign hard for his vice president and do everything i 
can to keep the white house in republican hands 
george wait until you and i get out there on the trail and 
start pinning him dukakis down on things he claims which we know 
are not true the president said 
as bush has been doing in recent days reagan accused the 
democrats of being too pessimistic 
if he listened to dukakis the president said i would be 
convinced that were in an economic downturn and that people are 
homeless and that people are going without food and medical 
attention and that weve got to do something about the 
unemployed 
dukakis responded good jobs and affordable housing and health 
insurance for working families are what the american dream is all 
about 
we can do a lot better than weve been doing to make that 
dream come true for every citizen in the land the governor said 
in a statement released by his campaign 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked today about 
reagans remark said the president believes the homeless is a 
very serious problem but what he was saying yesterday is that 
dukakis is the prophet of doom and gloom and always uses the 
homeless as an example of how everything is going wrong in 
america 
bush has been saying he is unworried by recent polls suggesting 
he trails dukakis he insists he relishes the underdogs role

democrat michael dukakis met today with costa 
rican president oscar arias and said the united states must 
develop a new relationship based on respect with latin american 
leaders his presidential campaign focused on choosing a running 
mate 
dukakis praised arias peace plan for central america and said 
the us government should consult frequently with leaders of the 
troubled region arias sidestepped a question about endorsing the 
certain democratic nominee saying only that he would be a good 
friend of whoever you decide to elect in november 
dukakis attended the harvard university commencement where 
arias was to give the main address and was at wife kittys side as 
she was released from massachusetts general hospital mrs dukakis 
is recovering from spinal surgery a week ago 
on wednesday dukakis placed paul brountas his senior adviser 
and friend since law school in charge of his vice presidential 
selection process 
he was the guy with the ideas brountas said of the 
massachusetts governor we talked about timing how to go about 
developing the process getting moving how were going to do it 
dukakis stopped in st louis along the way to receive the public 
backing of a defeated rival rep richard gephardt dmo two other 
rivals also clambered aboard the dukakis bandwagon sen paul 
simon dill and former gov bruce babbitt of arizona and he got 
the backing of new york gov mario cuomo as well 
we clashed from time to time but that conflict that trying 
and testing of ideas and energies can only be good for the party 
and for the nation gephardt said 
dukakis picked up 27 missouri delegates along with gephardts 
backing and simon released the delegates he had won but it hardly 
mattered 
dukakis had gained a majority of delegates with his twotoone 
victory in california bringing down the curtain on a race for the 
nomination that had long since lost its suspense 
at his first news conference since gaining a mathematical lock 
on the nomination dukakis rejected jacksons assertion that he had 
earned the right to choose whether he would join dukakis on the 
ticket 
he deserves consideration hes done a very impressive job in 
running his campaign dukakis said but there are other people 
who will be considered as well and its up to the nominee to make 
that selection 
he said his top priority would be selecting a firstrate 
candidate who could assume the presidency if needed and said 
traditional political considerations such as geographic region or 
ideology were of less importance 
other considerations obviously are not irrelevant but they 
pale by comparison dukakis said 
im going to cast my net far and wide he said it is best 
to begin with as large a group as possible 
he said he hoped to have a very good idea of who his running 
mate would be before the democratic national convention in atlanta 
in midjuly 
brountas said no formal search committee was planned and that 
he would discuss the selection with top campaign staff members and 
consult with political business and labor leaders 
brountas also said im sure jackson would be among those 
consulted 
dukakis was asked if any women were on his list and replied 
theres no list 
he said there was no ideological or issue litmus test im not 
looking for a clone he said 
dukakis turned briefly to the fall campaign against republican 
nomineetobe george bush taking issue with the vice presidents 
comparison of this election race to the 1972 campaign between 
george mcgovern and richard nixon 
thats nonsense dukakis told a television interviewer 
this isnt nixonmcgovern and its not fdrhoover this will be 
a campaign between two individuals both of whom have been in 
public life for a long time 
when dukakis returned home on wednesday night he was greeted by 
a crowd of about 75 people most of them campaign workers in his 
boston headquarters 
he arrived several hours late after being delayed in st louis 
by severe thunderstorms 
here i am the nominee i cant do anything about the 
weather he joked 
he thanked the campaign workers for their support and help 
saying you have helped to teach me and im very grateful to all 
of you

a high school senior says administrators 
apparently misinterpreted his comments in deciding to cancel 
graduation ceremonies and final exams for fear that students would 
carry out a suicide pact 
neal loeslein 18 denied the existence of a suicide pact or 
other plans for violence among students at fairview high school 
there wasnt one that was just a rumor he said in todays 
pittsburgh press 
loeslein told the newspaper he was the student present at 
christmastime at the home of another senior who fatally shot 
himself in the head with a handgun in this affluent lake erie 
suburb of about 7500 people 
he said that talk of a suicide pact surfaced soon afterward and 
that the talk apparently intensified two weeks ago when he told 
classmates in a general way this is a graduation we will all 
remember 
loeslein said he had planned to play out a practical joke at the 
ceremony but had not decided on the joke 
he accused administrators of spreading rumors they built all 
of this out of nothing he said 
officials on tuesday canceled baccalaureate ceremonies scheduled 
for today and graduation ceremonies scheduled for sunday for about 
150 seniors saying they have evidence of a suicide pact among 
friends of the dead student 
officials said another similar handgun was stolen from the dead 
students home 
its more than just pranks said school solicitor frank 
kroto its more than the typical end of the year dissatisfaction 
with authority 
administrators who spoke to the erie morning news on condition 
they not be identified said consultants determined at least two 
students involved in the alleged suicide pact were indeed suicidal 
kroto also said several school administrators also received 
personal threats and are under police protection he gave no 
details 
state police cpl james scheig said law enforcement authorities 
are not investigating the alleged threats of violence or the 
possibility of suicides he said some administrators homes were 
being checked periodically

the leftist sandinista government 
outlined a plan today that could lead to a lasting ceasefire in 
its sixyear civil war with usbacked rebels 
gen humberto ortega the defense minister released a timetable 
to free imprisoned rebels and former national guardsmen to discuss 
democratic reforms and to disarm the rebels known as contras 
the plan if approved by the contras later today would begin 
friday with the release of 200 former national guardsmen 
they the contras asked for the timetable and now they dont 
have any pretext not to sign a peace agreement said paul 
reichler a washington attorney who is on the sandinista 
negotiating committee 
ortega released the plan at a news conference and said he was 
giving it to contra negotiators there was no immediate comment by 
contra leaders 
under the plan contra combatants should begin moving into seven 
determined zones and sandinista troops will move out of those areas 
on june 16 
on july 12 the contras could relieve exclusively humanitarian 
aid and eight contras can take part in internal talks with the 
political opposition in managua on the same day the government 
would begin 60 days of talks on democratic reforms 
at the end of that period the contras would begin disarmament 
ortega said by oct 10 contras would leave the zones and 
disarmament would be completed 
on the same date the contras can receive exclusively 
humanitarian aid also eight contra representatives can take 
part in internal talks with the political opposition parties in 
managua also 50 percent of the contra prisoners will be freed and 
400 exnational guardsmen will be freed 
the contras had agreed to extend a truce that began on march 21 
until today it was not immediately clear whether the fighting 
which has killed more than 26000 people would start again 
the sandinistas say they will unilaterally observe a truce until 
june 30 
the rebels accused the sandinistas of being evasive about when 
promised democratic reforms would be enacted 
in our view a concrete result depends on the political 
goodwill of the government matamoros said 
the contras complained that the government postponed until today 
a meeting that had been planned wednesday afternoon with leaders of 
nicaraguas opposition political parties 
the meeting would be the first time contra leaders would be 
allowed to hold political talks with the internal opposition groups 
meanwhile the sandinista police wednesday rounded up 14 
political opposition figures for staging an unauthorized march 
they were detained briefly then released 
the demonstration was called to protest a law that has enabled 
the sandinistas to close radio stations for broadcasting what the 
government claims to be misinformation or unconfirmed news about 
the war or military draft 
among those detained were erick ramirez president of the social 
christian party and agustin harquin anaya president of a faction 
of the same party 
negotiators for the government and the rebels differ on amnesty 
for political prisoners political representation in national talks 
and disarmament 
matamoros said the contras on wednesday prepared a list of the 
names of 4207 political prisoners in 37 sandinista jails the 
government claims there are 3100 such prisoners

electronic warfare jet crashed during a touchandgo drill at 
miramar naval air station in san diego 
in touchandgo drills a pilot allows the planes wheels to 
briefly touch the runway before taking off again the drills often 
simulate a ground drop in combat conditions in which cargo would 
be dumped out of the moving plane 
maj jim bates a spokesman at little rock air force base said 
the aircraft was assigned to the 189th tactical airlift group of 
the arkansas air national guard

president reagan began telephoning members of 
congress about a new trade bill thursday as the white house 
expressed concern over a democratic parliamentary move in the wake 
of the senate vote sustaining his veto of a previous version 
the will of the senate was expressed yesterday and we are 
proceeding to work with the leadership in developing a new bill 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
president reagan is calling a number of members today to urge 
them to proceed as rapidly as possible on a new bill and i think we 
will be able to show some movement very soon fitzwater said 
the spokesman declined to identify the members the president was 
calling but said they were the leaders who have been involved in 
the development of this trade bill over a long period of time he 
said they included both democrats and republicans 
the senate fell five votes short wednesday of the twothirds 
majority required to make the trade measure law despite reagans 
objections 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva a strong supporter 
of the trade bill voted against it at the last minute in a 
parliamentary maneuver that could later allow him to ask for 
reconsideration of the 1000page bill 
fitzwater said byrds action does complicate it and we 
certainly are discouraged that he would try to do that it is 
certainly clear that the president wants a trade bill the 
republicans want a trade bill the democrats most of them want a 
trade bill and we would like to see it proceed as quickly as 
possible 
byrd in announcing his action said this is insurance that 
the american people can still have a trade bill this year he 
argued that efforts to draft a new measure could become hopelessly 
bogged down in debate over complex amendments 
the bill reagan vetoes would have overhauled the governments 
system for imposing import curbs to aid us industries and 
retaliate against trade violations 
reagan objected to a provision to require companies with 100 
employees or more to provide 60day notice of plant closings and 
largescale layoffs

a year after banning smoking in all 
buildings the mayo clinic is taking on a new pollutant microwave 
popcorn 
employees cannot pop corn in breakrooms and the clinic has 
removed the microwave product from vending machines 
the ban was prompted by complaints from patients who were teased 
by the smell while fasting in preparation for exams clinic 
spokeswoman meg black said 
the strong aroma would permeate to patient areas and it 
certainly wouldnt be fair to tell them they cant eat and then all 
of a sudden have them smelling popcorn black said

an israeli military official said thursday his 
troops have quelled the palestinian uprising against israels 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip but now are bracing for 
increased terrorism by a hard core of arab youths 
it took us more time than we expected said maj gen amram 
mitzna but israeli troops have gained back the deterrence that 
we lost at the beginning of the intifadah arabic for uprising 
mitzna the military commander of the west bank spoke to 
reporters during a visit to washington about the 7month arab 
revolt that has resulted in the deaths of 203 palestinians and two 
israelis 
there is no more high velocity of violence in the streets 
mitzna said the situation is calming down 
the palestinians willingness to openly confront isaeli soldiers 
is less and less mitzna said 
instead palestinians are resorting to pinpoint attacks such 
as hurling firebombs at israeli patrols mitzna said he predicted 
the palestinians will turn more to bombs and guns rather than the 
stones and burning tires that were their main weapons until now 
a hard core of palestinian youngsters is still there mitzna 
said although the majority of the population is tiring of the 
revolt 
having failed to accomplish political gains in the uprising 
it is a great worry for us that once again pure terrorism will 
return as palestinians seek recognition for their demands he 
said 
the 15 million palestinians in the territories captured by 
israel in the 1967 mideast war are demanding an end to israeli 
control and an independent state 
mitzna said the terrorism would be directed both against the 
estimated 65000 jewish settlers in the predominantly arab 
territories and against dense israeli population centers 
he predicted israel will have to maintain higher than normal 
troop levels in the occupied territories despite the returning calm 
because i dont think well be able to go back to the status 
quo 
israeli intelligence has reported broad disagreement within the 
leadership of the palestine liberation organizaiton over the future 
course of the revolt he said 
some think the uprising should be stopped because of its failure 
to achieve a political breakthrough and the high human toll it has 
exacted he said 
others in the plo think the antiisrael violence should be 
escalated in order to drive a permanent wedge between the 
palestinians in the territories and israel 
instructions by the palestinian leadership to boycott israeli 
products resign from israelipaid jobs and withhold payment of 
israeli taxes have had partial success which is now being eroded 
he said 
he conceded that israel still does not know who are the leaders 
of the uprising 
but he said the assassination in tunis last april of abu jihad 
the no 2 man in the plo will adversely affect the ability of the 
organizers to continue their revolt abu jihad who is widely 
believed to have been killed by israeli commandos was in charge of 
operations in the occupied territories 
israel has also taken another step to crush the leadership of 
the revolt by ordering the expulsion of mubarak awad a palestinian 
with us citizenship whom miztna described as the theoretical 
mastermind behind the revolt 
his deportation is first of all to cut his immediate influence 
in the area he said 
the united states has asked israel to reconsider the move but 
mitzna insisted that although awad did not have a role in 
organizing the revolt its leaders were translating his antiisrael 
writings into action

it was 9 am and tom herman was out the door of 
the massachusetts statehouse after an early morning meeting with 
his boss michael dukakis 
hermans time was up this was a statehouse day for dukakis 
who for 15 months has carefully juggled his dual role as 
massachusetts governor and presidential candidate 
herman a top presidential campaign issues adviser recalls 
asking dukakis to review position papers on health care and crime 
on a day the governor was tending to state duties 
tom statehouse days are state business days dukakis 
lectured him 
it drives some people crazy but thats mike dukakis herman 
said he has two morethanfulltime jobs now and while it can 
sometimes be very frustrating for us at the campaign he feels very 
strongly about statehouse days 
throughout his presidential campaign dukakis with few 
exceptions has spent at least two and generally three full days a 
week at the statehouse those statehouse days mean campaign aides 
have limited access to their candidate 
although he does use his statehouse office for some campaign 
staff meetings and receptions with visiting congressmen such 
sessions are infrequent and generally held either in the early 
morning before state offices open or in the late afternoon 
we respect his time as governor and will only interfere with 
that if it is absolutely necessary said campaign spokesman 
leslie dach campaign folks always want more time for the 
campaign but hes got a big job here 
there are some obvious signs of the separation of governor and 
candidate 
dukakis had a campaignfinanced telephone installed in his 
statehouse office so that he doesnt call advisers delegates 
supporters congressmen and others on his state phone campaign 
phones also were installed in the governors press office and those 
of his top aides 
in fact im speaking to you on that phone john devillars 
the governors deputy chief of staff said in a recent interview 
michael has a very cautious and careful and conservative approach 
to making certain that his political activities are separate and 
distinct from the exercise of his responsibilities as chief 
executive thats an approach that has marked his entire career 
the state each month charges the campaign for copying courier 
services and other campaignrelated expenses it incurs 
the careful bookkeeping is nothing new for dukakis who for 
years has reimbursed the state whenever his state car has been used 
to drive him to fundraisers or to the supermarket he also lists 
such trips as income on his tax returns 
but dukakis now has a horde of campaign reporters following him 
daily and it is inevitable that there will be some overlap between 
his state duties and his candidacy at recent statehouse briefings 
dukakis has set the ground rules questions on the topic of the day 
first before the media freeforall 
sometimes overlap is deliberate other times it is not 
when dukakis signs state legislation that he believes helps his 
national candidacy the words model for the nation frequently 
flow from the mouth of the governorcandidate he also is quick to 
schedule photo sessions with visiting congressmen or dignitaries 
but when campaign reporters are trying to make a national issue 
of a state problem its current budget crisis or controversial 
prison furlough program for example dukakis is equally quick to 
link them to a national problem or cite his record of making 
tough choices a stock line in his campaign stump speech 
other examples of overlap include the inclusion of a campaign 
aide in the governors scheduling meetings and increased demands on 
dukakis statehouse aides to answer campaignrelated queries 
dukakis also has used his gubernatorial stationery when sending 
campaignrelated letters to president reagan secretary of state 
george shultz other administration officials and congressional 
leaders 
the overlap also works the other way 
while on the road campaigning dukakis lugs along two nylon bags 
filled with state work which he tends to at breakfast and while 
traveling between campaign stops

a child molester who murdered five boys 
will die by injection after midnight tonight barring any 
unforeseen appeals 
arthur gary bishop who has forgone further appeals met 
wednesday with his parents his lawyer and mormon bishop heber 
geurtz and planned to spend his final hours fasting said 
corrections department spokesman juan benavidez 
he seems to be preparing himself for what will take place as 
well as anyone can benavidez said 
bishop 36 would be the third person in utah and the 99th 
person in the nation to be executed since the us supreme court 
reinstituted capital punishment in 1976 
because bishop wants to die and has been found competent by a 
judge civil rights groups such as amnesty international and the 
american civil liberties union say lastminute friendofthecourt 
appeals are unlikely 
bishop fired his attorneys and said he would not contest his 
death sentence further after the utah supreme court rejected his 
appeal in february he has said he hopes his death will bring peace 
to the parents of his victims 
art is resolute in his decision to go through with this 
said his attorney walter f bugden jr he is as ready as one can 
be to die 
bishop was taken late wednesday to a holding cell near the death 
chamber utah law allows the condemned to choose between death by 
lethal injection or firing squad 
bishops oldest victim was 13 two were 4 another was 6 and the 
other was 11 two of the boys were drowned after being struck on 
the head with a hammer another was killed with a hammer one was 
suffocated and one shot 
in taped statements to police after his arrest bishop an eagle 
scout and excommunicated mormon missionary said i know im 
damning myself to hell for doing it im glad you caught me 
because i couldnt stop i would do it again if i had a 
chance 
he also laughed at several points during his confession 
describing to police how he did his victims 
the lawyer said bishops spirits were not particularly high 
but he did joke about closing out his 5 commissary account at the 
prison 
he said something about not wanting to overdraw the account 
here because we already know there are first security banks all 
over hell bugden said 
the money was given to his brother douglas bishop who is 
serving a prison term for sexually abusing boys 
the last execution in utah was in august when pierre dale selby 
was put to death for the 1974 torturemurders of three people 
during a robbery at a stereo shop

so the 4monthold boy doesnt officially have a name 
its all a question of numbers as colleen ohara discovered 
when she tried to register her newborns name 3 months ago with 
the british columbia division of vital statistics 
she wanted to upgrade him one number from his father gerald 
charles thompson iii but she was told legislation prevents roman 
numerals from being used in names 
thats the name i wanted she said tuesday i want my son 
to carry on his fathers name 
district manager franca santucci said that if ms ohara wants 
to continue the family tradition she would have to spell out the 
roman numeral so the infants name would be gerald charles ohara 
the fourth thompson 
i dont want his middle name to be the fourth and thats what 
it would end up being ms ohara said im not giving up 
eventually he has to have a name

jesse jackson says the reporters covering his 
campaign will be better people for the experience and should in 
turn educate their bosses 
jackson frequently criticizes the news media in his speeches 
telling voters not to be misled by reports that play down his 
chances of winning the presidential nomination 
but he suggests hes done plenty for the reporters educating 
them on american culture by taking them to the back corners of the 
nation where he campaigned 
ive taken media people to low places ive taken them to the 
ghettos the barrios to reservations ive also taken them to the 
high places to see the real america he said 
he said this week he has seen a shift in news media attitudes 
toward his candidacy over the course of the campaign 
there has been an evolution in the medias consciousness and 
in its maturity he said after all the media leaders 
themselves are bound by their own culture and they must grow and 
expand 
our campaign in some measure has been a factor in educating 
many members of the media some have made better grades than 
others jackson said in the course of our campaign you have 
seen a growth process taking place 
the people working on my campaign will be better people when 
its over theyll be different people theyve seen more of 
america than most americans have the media people working on my 
campaign know more than their editors do their publishers do 
these reporters now must educate their bosses he suggested 
he objected that news reports have raised the issue of his race 
and he said there should be more minority members and women in 
positions of news leadership 
im the stimulus im the catalyst for that change and one 
day when you look into newsrooms youre going to see black white 
and brown publishers and editors correspondents script writers 
he said there must be a multicultural presence in that room to 
have a multicultural result

businesses enjoying a boom in export sales 
plan to modernize and expand at the fastest rate in four years the 
government said thursday 
the commerce department said a survey completed in may showed 
us companies plan to spend 4352 billion on capital projects an 
119 percent increase over last years spending of 3888 billion 
if realized it would be the biggest gain in plant and equipment 
spending since 1984 when spending shot up 166 percent as 
businesses recovered from the 198182 recession the rate of 
increase would be seven times greater than the anemic 17 percent 
gain posted in 1987 
in 1986 investment spending fell by 26 percent as firms put 
plans on hold while congress rewrote the tax code spending had 
increased a strong 96 percent in 1985 
the new estimate which is adjusted to remove the effects of 
inflation represents an upward revision from a previous survey 
completed in march which had put the gain for 1988 at 80 percent 
analysts said the report was good news for the economy because 
the cheaper dollar has created more demand abroad for american 
goods us industries need to increase their manufacturing 
capacity in order to simultaneously boost export production and 
avoid inflationary pressures 
manufacturing especially in 1988 looks like it has very 
aggressive plans thats got to be good news said david 
wyss chief financial economist of data resources inc of 
lexington mass 
manufacturers expected to boost spending by 129 percent makers 
of durable goods big ticket items expected to last three or 
more years expect to boost capital spending by 116 percent while 
producers of nondurable products expect a 142 percent increase 
nonmanufacturing firms projected an 113 percent increase with 
transportation companies predicting a 101 percent rise mining 
companies a 56 percent increase and utilities a 32 percent gain 
however wyss warned that rising interest rates or renewed 
trouble in the stock market could cause businesses to quickly scale 
back expansion plans 
people are still very nervous especially after the stock 
market crash as result any evidence of a slowing economy or 
financial turmoil could have an even bigger effect than normal on 
expansion plans he said 
stephen s roach senior economist at morgan stanley amp co in 
new york sounded another cautionary note although increases in 
capital spending are real and very solid much of the 
investment surge is going for hightechnology items like computers 
telecommunications equipment photocopiers and scientific 
instruments he said 
we continue to feel that the bulk of this increase is not 
showing up in any dramatic new construction of industrial 
facilities and thats where our capacity shortfall is most 
notable he said 
more spending by businesses for hightechnology equipment much 
of it imported from abroad is probably bad news for efforts to 
reduce the trade deficit he said 
the new survey taken after businesses had the actual spending 
totals for the first quarter showed a 10 percent increase in 
investment spending during the first three months of this year 
following a 38 percent increase in the last three months of 1988 
expectations for the rest of the year are for a giant 48 
percent rise during the current quarter a 22 percent increase in 
the third quarter and a 18 percent gain in the fourth quarter 
roach said that pattern was consistent with the theory that 
businesses are spending sooner rather than later because of 
uncertainty about the stock market and interest rates

there were security problems at 830pupil school 
everyone there says that theres security said parent 
teresa troy among those at ms martins office thursday theres 
no security theyre lying and everyones covering it up 
another mother debra allen complained her daughter had come 
home with a black eye earlier in the week and school officials 
knew nothing about it 
the alleged offenders described by police as olderlooking 
and stronger were in the same fifthgrade class as the victims 
the teacher allowed groups of boys to go to the bathroom to 
minimize class disruption school officials said 
the case was discovered monday when one victim told a teacher 
and ms martin alerted police 
the boys told investigators they were mimicking acts they saw on 
latenight cable television said police sgt james mazer 
the incidents are isolated to students in this one class 
mazer said we dont know with what regularity the attacks 
occurred we believe they didnt happen every day but a few 
times

a force of 800 firefighters closed the 
noose early today around the fire that has scorched nearly 23000 
acres of grass and timber since sunday on the northern cheyenne 
indian reservation 
fire boss al kutt said he probably would declare the blaze 
contained tonight and under control friday night a day earlier 
than he had predicted and might be able to begin demobilizing the 
firefighting force on saturday 
its looking great really great kutt said 
four days of temperatures over 100 degrees and low humidity had 
fueled the fire but sudden cooling wednesday night gave 
firefighters a boost kutt said 
im sitting here with a wool sweater on he said 
the fire was 98 percent contained by wednesday night said fire 
information officer michelle ravnikar hot dry weather and wind 
gusts combined to double the size of the fire tuesday night when 
it ballooned from about 10000 acres 
thats about the most extreme fire behavior ive ever seen 
al kutt incident commander said wednesday it went bananas last 
night 
at the most extreme points the fire stretches about 10 miles 
from east to west and seven miles from north to south 
crews came from montana wyoming idaho and the dakotas fought 
the blaze officials have estimated the cost of the firefighting 
effort at 450000

the school board in this mountain resort has 
decided to go into the real estate business to help employees live 
in the community where the average price of a house is 275000 
aspen is a very expensive place to live we want our teachers 
to be an integral part of our community and not have to commute 
board president jon seigle said wednesday 
the district with an enrollment of just over 1000 is 
negotiating to buy a threebedroom condominium and may lease a 
house and rent it to a new administrator he said 
officials also are looking at buying land and leasing it to 
teachers to build homes seigle said the board is working with the 
aspenpitkin county housing authority to acquire 10 to 15 
properties in coming years he said 
in aspen the going price for a twobedroom condominium is about 
1200 a month he said while the school districts average salary 
is about 2600 a month 
while aspen is a very attractive place to come and work it 
causes us problems when we get a final candidate for a job and they 
look at the price of housing seigle said 
some teachers and administrators commute 20 to 30 miles he said 
every employer group is affected from the person who is 
trying to hire the dishwasher to the people who are hiring the 
school superintendent said jim adamski executive director of 
the housing authority 
costs for housing provided by the district will be negotiated in 
future salary and benefit packages with the teacher or 
administrator paying the district rent said seigle

for barbara kirchner and her band 
of diehard antinuclear protesters the vigil goes on outside a 
rocket base despite the superpower accord scrapping mediumrange 
nuclear weapons in europe 
ms kirchner 21 vows to persist until the last of the missiles 
leaves west germany in 1991 but now shes under pressure from the 
antinuclear movement to clear out of a house near the mutlangen 
us missile base 25 miles east of stuttgart 
for the past two years ms kirchner has been the most outspoken 
among the few remaining activists occupying the ramshackle building 
200 yards from the entrance of the pershing 2 missile site 
only about six to eight are regulars here anymore ms 
kirchner said of what was once a group of more than two dozen that 
occupied the house and regularly protested at the site after 
missiles were stationed in november 1983 
the house is owned by a peace group called the peace and 
encounter center ms kirchner said now with the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty ratified june 1 they want 
us to move out so they can use it to conduct seminars on 
nonviolent resistance she said but we dont want to leave 
and were not going to stop until everything is out 
in the months before and during initial deployment of the 
missiles in west germany hundreds of thousands of west germans 
protested nationwide as the first site to get the nuclear weapons 
mutlangen became a focal point for demonstrators 
ms kirchner spoke to the associated press on wednesday during a 
press tour of the site given by us officials to explain how 
verification and removal of the pershing 2s in accordance with the 
inf treaty would be conducted 
about 100 protesters stood outside the entrance as reporters 
were bused in some waving others holding up banners reading 
take the toys from the boys or you cant have both babies 
and bombs 
within the west german antimissile movement there are mixed 
feelings about the results of the superpowers inf treaty to remove 
the pershing 2s some see it as a victory while others see it as a 
propaganda stunt 
its being sold to the public as disarmament when in fact 
there are still thousands of air sea and other nuclear weapons 
ms kirchner said 
but she claimed the treaty shows her group has been successful 
we have achieved something the west german government will 
find it very difficult to ever again take part in an arms 
buildup ms kirchner said

a fire at a chevron refinery was 
extinguished thursday after burning for nearly 20 hours following 
an explosion at the plant 
the fire began in a pump station at the refinery west of port 
arthur on wednesday morning and spread to some small storage tanks 
nearby 
later wednesday some burning fluid began spreading along the 
ground and into ditches but was kept isolated chevron spokesman 
art spencer said 
five people suffered minor injuries and one firefighter was 
admitted to a hospital for observation suffering from dehydration 
and heat exhaustion 
spencer said it was too early to determine what caused the 
explosion 
crews located a valve believed to be feeding the fire with 
unfinished gasoline and closed it off wednesday afternoon but the 
fire continued through the night 
spencer said most of the blast occurred away from the main 
manufacturing area and was not affecting all operations at the 
plant 
the refinery pump station moves hydrocarbons unfinished 
gasoline from the manufacturing section to the storage area

defendants were jailed in serious cases only 
as the city struggled today to meet a courtimposed cap on its 
prison population 
the city had freed 180 inmates as of wednesday afternoon but it 
was not enough to meet the limit of 3750 prisoners by the courts 
deadline of 5 pm wednesday that triggered a moratorium on the 
jailing of inmates on minor charges 
at midnight wednesday the count stood at 3865 according to 
bail commissioner charles murray 
under the court order the moratorium is the only sanction 
imposed against the city for failing to meet the cap said william 
c babcock special courtappointed prison master the order 
contains no fines or other penalties he said 
district attorney ronald castille who unsuccessfully challenged 
the population cap criticized the citys decision to bail out 
inmates 
if the city puts up the bail theres no incentive for the 
person to show up he said if he wants to come in he can but 
why should he 
a small group of philadelphians cursed inmates leaving one jail 
wednesday and people driving by shouted lock em up and 
dont let them out 
terry williamson a spokesman for the district attorneys 
office said the order prevents the city from jailing all but those 
accused of the most serious crimes murder or attempted murder 
rape or attempted rape kidnapping arson robbery aggravated 
assault or crimes involving a gun knife or large amounts of drugs 
other suspects will be arraigned given court dates and freed 
police will continue to make arrests without regard for the 
prison population said spokesman detective edward tenuto police 
will do their duty as theyre trained to do he said 
us district judge norma shapiro on friday ordered the city to 
reduce the prison population to 3750 inmates 259 fewer than 
mondays total 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals issued an emergency stay 
at castilles request but unexpectedly reversed itself tuesday 
without explanation 
the ceiling was set in a consent decree the city signed in 1986 
and originally was scheduled to meet a year ago the agreement 
stemmed from a 1982 classaction suit by inmates challenging 
conditions in philadelphias four prisons

holmes bell that he was aware of unreported test failures on 
laserguided bomb gyroscopes made by allied corps bendix guidance 
systems division 
i literally shut my eyes said iadarola currently of 
roseland nj i knew of the problems but i did nothing to 
disclose the problems or solve them this was wrong 
iadarola was indicted in august on one count of conspiring with 
six employees he supervised to defraud the us government by 
allowing the reports to be falsified and sent to the government he 
also was charged with 19 counts of making the false statements and 
concealing facts from the government and with 14 counts of mail and 
wire fraud 
he pleaded guilty wednesday to the conspiracy count and one 
count of causing a false report to be prepared and facts to be 
concealed from the air force 
iadarola faces a maximum of five years in prison and a 250000 
fine on each count at sentencing aug 19 
but assistant us attorney thomas j gezon said iadarola 
pleaded guilty in exchange for the governments agreement not to 
fight his request that he receive a sentence similar to those his 
former employees received 
the six men were each fined 5000 bell also ordered each to 
perform 200 hours of community service and placed them on three

officials at this us air base 
are thinking of everything from interpreters to miniature bottles 
of vodka as they prepare for a soviet inspection of the bases 101 
cruise nuclear missiles 
at a halfdozen gates around the base disheveled groups of 
antinuclear protesters are waiting it out too 
the protesters smoky littered tent and cardboard camps have 
been at greenham common 50 miles west of london since 1981 
it is one of the oldest of the peace camps set up at us 
facilities to protest the deployment of us intermediaterange 
missiles in europe 
deployment began in november 1983 when the first missiles 
arrived at greenham common 
under the superpower arms control agreement ratified june 1 the 
900 missiles are being removed from bases in four west european 
countries along with around 1800 soviet mediumrange missiles 
aimed at western europe 
but the protesters say they will stay on suspicious that prime 
minister margaret thatchers conservative government and the united 
states will simply agree to install some other deadly weapons at 
greenham 
i doubt if ratification means much said sarah hipperson a 
middleaged protester who gave up a job and a regular home six 
years ago to live outside greenham common we are looking for a 
whole conversion away from nuclear weapons 
on wednesday the us military allowed journalists into 
greenham common and two other intermediaterange nuclear missile 
bases at florennes in belgium and mutlangen west germany for the 
first time 
the previously closely shrouded weapons were shown off before 
the arrival of the soviet inspectors according to the treaty the 
first inspections by 10member teams will take place at 16 hours 
notice in july or august 
the inspectors will make baseline checks to verify the 
missiles in place before dismantling by 1991 all the missiles must 
be gone sent back for destruction under soviet eyes at us 
facilities 
what youll have at the end of this is scrap metal said 
greenham common comander william e jones indicating the 55foot 
missile launchers lined up beside the giant grasscovered bunkers 
from which they still make forays into the english countryside on 
manuevers 
when theyve been i shall feel very verified said jones 
46 of memphis tenn adding the treaty provisions were tight 
enough to stop cheating by either side 
the soviet team which can stay as long as 4 days on any one 
inspection visit will remain on the base or be taken under escort 
to the second cruise base in britain at molesworth twentynine 
missiles are deployed there

the worlds most powerful particle 
accelerator has passed its last major test and will begin operating 
this september to help physicists explore the fundamental nature of 
matter its director said 
the k800 cyclotron at the national superconducting cyclotron 
laboratory was successful in accelerating a beam of atomic 
particles to nearly 40000 miles per second onefifth the speed 
of light and then directing it onto a stainless steel target 
the k800 now will really move into a 10 to 20year career as 
a very important research instrument this should really be the 
worlds center for heavy ion nuclear physics said henry blosser 
codirector of the governmentfunded cyclotron laboratory at 
michigan state university 
blosser said the 10 million machine which has been under 
construction since 1980 would be ready to go to work in september 
the laboratory will ask scientists from around the world to send 
in proposals for experiments that will be evaluated by an advisory 
committee he said about 75 percent of the experiments selected 
will be done by american scientists while the rest will be 
conducted by foreign researchers 
blosser said once experiments began the cyclotron would operate 
24 hours a day seven days a week beehive is a good word for 
what it will be like he said 
the energy of the test beam generated was 360 million electron 
volts but the machine is capable of accelerating particles to a 
level approaching 8 billion electron volts 
by comparison the worlds second most powerful heavy ion 
cyclotron ganil in caen france has accelerated beams to an 
energy level of 4 billion electron volts 
the k800 cyclotron funded by the national science foundation 
can accelerate atomic nuclei as heavy as uranium which is the 
heaviest of the naturally occuring elements 
in comparison with pre1980s cyclotrons its like being able 
to accelerate cannon balls instead of bbs blosser said 
sam austin the labs other codirector said experiments 
performed on the machine could guide physicists to fundamental 
rules governing subatomic matter this in turn could lead to a 
better understanding of cosmic events such as the explosions of 
stars or supernovas 
it will be possible to see how nuclear material behaves when 
it is compressed by the highspeed impact of one very heavy nucleus 
on another austin said this compression leads to extremes of 
density and temperature as great as those that cause stars to 
explode and led to the big bang that created the universe 
physicists think that the universe began from a point of 
incredibly dense matter that exploded billions of years ago and is 
still expanding 
scientists generated the k800s first highenergy beam in 
february using its superconducting magnet to accelerate 
electrically charged helium and carbon nuclei in a tight spiral 
within the 7foot diameter confines of the cyclotrons magnetic 
field the nuclei gradually reached a speed of more than 60000 
miles per second or about a third the speed of light 186451 
miles per second 
the latest test succeeded in targeting a beam consisting of the 
cores of heavier atoms 
for their experiments scientists will direct the beam into 
other atomic particles a complex array of electromagnetic 
radiation detctors linked to computers will record the outcome of 
the collisions 
physicists hope that by studying the effects of temperature 
pressure and energy of impact they will be able to define 
fundamental relationships governing nuclear matter and reactions 
an earlier model of the k800 the k500 went into operation in 
1982 and has been used by more than 275 scientists from 47 
institutions

the commerce department released new figures 
thursday showing that the countrys huge trade deficits are 
improving but not as quickly as previously believed 
the departments new statistics for the first time in two years 
adjust the monthly numbers for normal seasonal changes in shipping 
patterns 
with seasonal adjustment the trade deficit for march turned out 
to be 119 billion 22 percent higher than the previously reported 
97 billion figure 
the nonadjusted figure the best showing in three years had 
been hailed by the reagan administration as solid evidence that the 
countrys trade problems had finally turned around 
the administration said the new figures still show an improving 
trend noting that the average monthly deficit for the first three 
months of the year was 125 billion compared to an average 
deficit of 143 billion in the final three months of 1987 a 
decline of 13 percent 
the nonadjusted figures showed a sharper 21 percent drop from 
the fourth quarter to the first quarter 
the trade deficit is on a downward trend exports are 
increasing and its a very encouraging picture in terms of the 
foreign trade deficit said presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater in an assessment that was echoed by private economists 
the seasonally adjusted figures show that trade is slowly 
turning and that should be the story for the rest of the year 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co there is no 
reason to be discouraged by the new figures 
commerce undersecretary robert ortner said the revised figure 
had been anticipated given the fact that us export sales always 
climb sharply during march and the seasonal adjustment would take 
that into account 
most government statistics are adjusted to factor out 
fluctuations which occur on a seasonal basis such as the normal 
drop in housing construction during winter months but the 
government was forced to abandon seasonal adjustments of the trade 
figures for two years because of problems with collecting the data 
on a timely basis 
with that problem solved the government will resume reporting 
seasonally adjusted trade figures beginning with the april trade 
report scheduled to be released next tuesday 
ortner said that the deficit so far this year is running at an 
annual average of 150 billion about what the administration has 
been expecting the merchandise trade deficit hit a record 1703 
billion last year 
the annual figure for 1987 was revised slightly from an original 
figure of 1712 billion the 1986 figure was also revised to show 
a deficit of 1551 billion the changes in the annual totals 
reflected more complete data rather than any effect from seasonal 
adjustments which will not change annual totals 
the february deficit which had originally been reported at 
138 billion was raised to 144 billion while the january 
deficit originally reported as 124 billion was lowered by the 
seasonal adjustment to 113 billion 
government statisticians hope that the seasonal adjustments by 
smoothing out the monthtomonth volatility will ease some of the 
extreme reactions financial markets have had to the monthly trade 
figures 
bad trade figures were blamed for adding to the pessimistic mood 
right before last octobers stock market crash just two months ago 
the original report on the february deficit which was much higher 
than had been expected sent the dow jones industrial average down 
by 101 points its fifth worst loss ever 
the seasonal adjustments will cover about 80 percent of us 
trade one major exception will be oil imports the government said 
it could not detect any seasonal pattern to these shipments so they 
will not be adjusted 
before 1986 the government had always adjusted the monthly 
import and export figures to smooth out seasonal shipping patterns 
however it was forced to abandon the practice when a tide of 
imports overwhelmed the ability of the customs service to process 
the trade information on a timely basis 
in some months the socalled carryover of late information from 
previous months accounted for 50 percent of the new months total 
that figure has now been reduced to around 3 percent per month

independent counsel lawrence walsh today 
selected fired national security council aide oliver l north as 
the first of four defendants to be tried in the irancontra 
conspiracy case 
walsh advised us district judge gerhard a gesell of his 
selection of north but also asked the judge to reconsider his 
decision ordering separate trials for north former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim 
and richard a secord 
walsh asked that gesell order two dualjury trials in which 
north and poindexter would first be tried together and hakim and 
secord would then go to trial jointly 
gesell had ruled that trying the four defendants jointly would 
prejudice their constitutional rights because of the inability to 
use the defendants immunized congressional testimony as part of 
the defense 
gesell had ordered separate trials to allow one defendant for 
example north to use poindexters congressional testimony as part 
of his defense 
the government recognizes the need to safeguard such rights 
but submits that there are ways to accommodate those interests 
without imposing the tremendous burden of four sequential trials on 
the government and the judiciary walsh said in a brief filed 
with the court 
walsh said that two juries could be empaneled to hear a joint 
trial of north and poindexter without prejudicing each defendants 
constitutional rights the evidence the government would offer at 
separate trials of north and poindexter and of secord and hakim 
would be overlapping walsh said 
walsh said it would be logical to try north and poindexter 
together because they are accused of using their positions of 
trust and power to facilitate and protect an illegal financial and 
logistical network to divert us arms sale profits to the 
contras 
secord and hakim should be tried together walsh said because 
they are accused of operating an illegal enterprise to carry out 
activities forbidden to the government 
walsh explained how a dualjury trial could protect an 
individuals constitutional rights when one of the two 
defendants being tried together seeks to introduce the immunized 
testimony of his codefendant the codefendants jury can be 
excused from the courtroom thereby protecting the defendants 
constitutional right not to have his immunized testimony used 
against him he said 
walsh had been given till friday to notify gesell which 
defendant he wanted to proceed with first in asking the judge to 
reconsider his severance ruling walsh said that four separate 
and sequential trials will result in at least some of the 
defendants living under the cloud of an indictment for several 
months 
the public has its own interest in a speedy resolution of the 
charges against the defendants which may not be met if these cases 
are permitted to extend over a period of years he said 
legal experts say the irancontra prosecutors were handed a 
worst case scenario when gesell ruled that the defendants must 
each be tried separately 
its like kissing a rattlesnake said former federal 
prosecutor e lawrence barcella jr of washington describing the 
ordeal of conducting what is essentially the same case over and 
over again its not fun and usually injurious to your health 
the immunized testimony would likely be inadmissible in a single 
trial thus denying defendants their normal right to crossexamine 
each other on their prior statements 
the defendants have said the immunized testimony of the other 
defendants before the congressional irancontra committees would 
show their innocence prosecutors cannot introduce the immunized 
testimony of the specific defendant on trial as part of their case 
against that defendant 
the four defendants are charged with conspiring to illegally 
divert profits from us arms sales to iran to the nicaraguan 
contras when such assistance was banned 
gesell said either north a former national security staffer or 
poindexter must be tried first north is charged in 16 counts of 
the 23count indictment while poindexter is named in seven 
the judge also said he had not made final decisions on whether 
the congressional immunity given to all defendants except secord 
posed such a serious problem as to preclude trying the cases at all 
he said he would decide that and other major pretrial issues by 
july 1 so he could set a date for a prompt trial 
one legal source familiar with the case who would comment only 
on condition of anonymity said the ruling could have one beneficial 
effect for the prosecution 
he said walsh would have the right to call anyone convicted in 
an earlier trial as a witness in a subsequent trial if the four 
had been tried together the prosecution could not call one 
defendant to testify against another 
but barcella who handled major antiterrorism cases as an 
assistant us attorney in washington and his former boss 
exus attorney joseph digenova agreed that on balance the 
ruling went against prosecutors 
this ruins the prosecutions entire strategy digenova said 
its what every prosecutor dreads its the worst case scenario 
for the independent counsel 
prosecutors wanted all four in the courtroom together he 
said they wanted the entire conspiracy before the jury which 
could look at them see the evidence against all of them and weigh 
the conspiracy against them 
in his ruling gesell said any defendant should have 
considerable leeway to use indirectly and possibly directly 
immunized testimony while defending the charges against him 
each of the three defendants who gave immunized testimony 
revealed information which one or more of the defendants considers 
helpful to his own defense if not exonerating some aspect of the 
case gesell said 
separate trials are needed because trying the defendants jointly 
would compromise each defendants fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination and the sixth amendment right to challenge the 
testimony through crossexamination the judge said 
the judge provisionally denied a defense motion to continue the 
trials until after the november election saying prospective jurors 
would have to be questioned about whether political discussions 
about the irancontra affair would undermine their impartiality 
the judge also ruled all the trials would be held in washington 
denying defense requests that they be moved because of extensive 
pretrial publicity

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze said today that a team of israeli diplomats will visit 
the soviet union next month but said full diplomatic relations 
cannot be resumed until israel agrees to an international peace 
conference on the middle east 
shevardnadze made the statement to reporters after a meeting 
with prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel both men described 
the session as friendly and useful but without any breakthrough or 
flexibility on either side 
the soviet minister also said emigration of soviet jews was 
continuing he said there were some constraints which he 
identified as military secrets only 
i would not call this meeting a new stage in relations but it 
was a useful meeting shevardnadze later told a news conference 
if we can convene an international conference shevardnadze 
said that would make it possible to settle the problems of our 
diplomatic relations 
shevardnadze asked if the soviet union would not restore full 
diplomatic relations without a unsponsored conference answered 
yes he said a conference was the only way to reach a 
comprehensive settlement of the middle east problem 
shamir told reporters the hour and 50minute session was very 
friendly productive and useful but he stood firm against an 
international peace conference 
shamir told israeli reporters that a consular team would visit 
the soviet union in the second half of july and indicated it would 
issue visas to soviet jews who wish to emigrate 
a soviet consular team earlier visited israel and this would be 
a reciprocal visit 
but shevardnadze asked if the team would issue visas said 
no 
it was shamirs first meeting with a soviet official since 1984 
when he met foreign minister andrei gromyko shevardnadze has met 
israeli foreign minister shimon peres who takes a more flexible 
position on the middle east 
diplomats said the meeting could signal a new warming of 
sovietisraeli relations and reflected the increased soviet 
interest in improved ties and increased influence in the middle 
east 
shamir said it would be difficult for the soviet union to play a 
constructive role in a middle east settlement without having 
diplomatic relations with israel the soviet union broke relations 
during the 1967 middle east war 
the israeli prime minister said the two discussed the middle 
east situation the state of sovietisraeli relations the problem 
of emigration of soviet jews the arms race and arms reduction 
he gave no details but said i think there will be some 
further discussions on the same problems 
the soviet union sought the meeting with shamir in its first 
contact with the conservative leader shamir has opposed a soviet 
call for a middle east peace conference and the exchange of 
israelioccupied arab lands for peace peres has been more 
conciliatory 
israel favors direct talks with her arab neighbors and officials 
say an international conference is an excuse for not negotiating 
directly with israel it says it will not accept any imposed 
settlement 
israel is opposed to inclusion of the palestine liberation 
organization in any conference while most nations regard the plo 
as the only legitimate representative of the palestinian people

boris n yeltsin the communist party firebrand 
and fallen protege of mikhail s gorbachev has been elected to 
attend a party conference where he and other reformers may square 
off against conservatives over gorbachevs reforms 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said thursday 
that yeltsin will attend this months 19th communist party 
conference 
the presence of the outspoken acidtongued yeltsin who was 
ousted in november as moscow party boss may make for lively debate 
at the nationwide conference the partys first in 47 years 
the election of yeltsin to the party conference continues the 
rollercoaster career of the 57yearold russian who was fired as 
moscow party boss and stripped of his post as a nonvoting member 
of the politburo because of a speech he gave to the central 
committee in october 
prominent advocates of gorbachevs reform drive allege that 
middleechelon apparatchiks in the 20million member communist 
party have maneuvered to bar many gorbachev allies from the meeting 
the newspaper of the moscow city party moskovskaya pravda 
complained thursday that election of the candidates has not 
everywhere been conducted in the atmosphere of broad openness 
the nominating procedure should be changed because some party and 
nonparty members could not voice their opinions it said 
the conference is considered crucial because it will consider 
potentially radical changes that remove vestiges of stalinism from 
the soviet political and legal system those changes could be in 
doubt if conservatives dominate among the 5000 delegates the 
conference is scheduled to convene in moscow june 28 
among changes they will consider is a proposed limit on the 
terms of communist party officials who have been virtually assured 
of lifetime tenure 
however a set of proposals approved by the partys 
policymaking central committee published on may 26 advocates a 
limit of two fiveyear terms for all party officials including 
gorbachev the partys general secretary 
such provisions as well as gorbachevs campaign for 
perestroika or economic and social restructuring threaten the 
power and privilege of many party officials 
the contest for election to the 19th party conference has been 
like no other party balloting in memory with disputes openly aired 
in official media a petition drive on behalf of one reformist 
candidate in moscows pushkin square and a street rally in 
leningrad that reportedly drew 1500 people 
prominent progorbachev supporter tatyana zaslavskaya a 
sociologist charged friday that because of conservative 
bureaucrats maneuvering the most pronounced advocates of 
perestroika were not selected as delegates to the conference 
that evening the moscow party leadership put zaslavskaya and 
some other outspoken gorbachev supporters back on the ballot as 
candidates to help fill the 319 delegate slots from moscow 
zaslavskaya and several others were not elected but other 
prominent perestroika advocates were including filmmaker elem 
klimov and economist leonid abalkin 
the politburo the partys ruling body acted monday to make 
sure the views of rankandfile communists are represented at the 
conference in an apparent move to further shortcircuit the 
influence of middlelevel officials 
in an official communique the politburo instructed local party 
committees to collect proposals from the grassroots to to make sure 
they will be taken up yeltsins october speech criticized the no 
2 man in the soviet leadership yegor k ligachev and complained 
that gorbachevs program for social and economic change was moving 
too slowly 
he gave several interviews to western television networks last 
week during the sovietamerican summit solidifying his reputation 
for speaking his mind freely about highly controversial matters in 
one interview he called for ligachev to resign because he was 
blocking reforms 
a week after being fired from his moscow party job yeltsin was 
named first deputy chairman of the state building committee 
yeltsin was named a delegate from karelia an autonomous soviet 
republic north of leningrad and near the finnish border yeltsin 
has no known contacts with karelia but gerasimov speaking at a 
government news briefing said there was no requirement in party 
rules that a conference delegate live or work in the area he is 
chosen to represent 
by calling a party conference gorbachev is using an instrument 
that was last used and then discarded by stalin the partys 
nominally supreme body is the congress which meets every five 
years the last party congress the 27th took place in 1986

issued at a news conference where attorney general edwin meese iii 
underscored the impact of crime

american will be the victim of a theft during a lifetime and that 
if crime continues at current levels five of every six people will 
be the victim of an attempted or completed crime of violence

federal health officials recommended thursday 
that all pregnant women be tested for hepatitis and that newborns 
of infected women be vaccinated to prevent 3500 babies a year 
from becoming potentially doomed hepatitis carriers 
the centers for disease control which in 1984 recommended 
typeb hepatitis tests for women in highrisk groups such as 
injectible drug abusers and some venereal disease patients said 
thursday that many obstetricians dont know what the highrisk 
groups are and the plan has not worked 
it is now evident that routine screening of all pregnant women 
is the only strategy that will provide acceptable control of 
mothertochild hepatitis b transmission the cdc said in its 
weekly report 
each year in the united states about 16500 babies are born to 
mothers with hepatitis b infections the cdc said about 3500 of 
those infants become chronic hepatitis b carriers and it is 
estimated that more than 25 percent of them will die of liver 
cancer or cirrhosis 
the cdcs immunization practices advisory committee now 
recommends that pregnant women be tested for hepatitis b during an 
early prenatal visit if a woman is infected her baby should 
receive hepatitis b immune globulin preferably within 12 hours of 
birth to provide immediate protection and hepatitis b vaccine 
within seven days and again at 1 month and 6 months 
such a routine is between 85 percent and 95 percent effective in 
preventing a child from becoming a chronic hepatitis b carrier cdc 
researchers said 
the cdc also recommends screening household members and sexual 
partners of infected women and vaccinating them if appropriate 
hepatitis b vaccine is the first human vaccine that can 
prevent both serious chronic disease and a uniformly fatal type of 
cancer the cdc noted 
still vaccinating every newborn child in the united states for 
hepatitis b is not practical from a cost standpoint said dr mark 
kane a cdc hepatitis specialist a childs vaccine regimen costs 
60 or more he noted 
hepatitis b is one of the two most common forms of hepatitis a 
serious inflammation of the liver hepatitis b is transmitted 
chiefly in the blood there is not yet a vaccine for hepatitis a 
which is most commonly associated with poor hygiene 
about 25000 cases of each type occur in the united states each 
year 
highrisk groups for hepatitis b include injectible drug users 
homosexually active men heterosexuals with multiple episodes of 
venereal disease and medical personnel exposed to blood on the job 
the cdc previously recommended hepatitis b tests for highrisk 
women but major problems have been encountered in implementing 
these recommendations the atlantabased agency said in its 
weekly report 
there have been about 10 scientific papers over the past two 
years studying the matter and almost all have pointed out that the 
previous recommendations were inadequate kane said 
in one study 40 percent of obstetricians couldnt name more 
than two highrisk groups for hepatitis b and 72 percent didnt 
know the recommended treatment for infants born to infected 
mothers the cdc said 
in addition studies in several innercity hospitals which test 
all pregnant women found that only 35 percent to 65 percent of 
those infected would fall under the old guidelines 
also thursday the cdc recommended vaccination of all newborns 
in certain small but veryhighrisk populations such as alaskan 
natives and pacific islanders in those groups hepatitis b is 
highly endemic the cdc said

israeli soldiers killed a palestinian and 
wounded four on thursday one of the most violent recent days in 
the occupied lands and arabs mounted another general strike to 
begin the seventh month of their rebellion 
at least 203 palestinians have been killed and more than 5000 
injured since the uprising began dec 8 and 5000 arabs are in 
prison an israeli soldier and a jewish settler also have been 
slain 
stores were closed and public transport halted thursday in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip and in arab east jerusalem but 
the army said many palestinians ignored the general strike 
a 40yearold arab motorist died of a heart attack after his car 
was stoned as he passed the dheishe refugee camp near bethlehem 
the army said israel radio said camp residents stoned several 
arabowned cars apparently to enforce compliance with the strike 
the radio quoted military officials it did not identify as 
saying thursday was one of the most violent days since the level of 
protest began to decline in may 
in an attempt to quell violence the army put eight refugee 
camps and towns under curfews that confined nearly nearly 10 
percent of the 15 million palestinians in occupied territories to 
their homes 
a report by six army doctors on army methods in gaza accused 
soldiers of misusing tear gas by firing it into closed spaces 
it also said use of highvelocity bullets that can cause 
devastating injuries is unjustified in dispersing protests the 
army will not say whether it uses such ammunition 
at khezaa village in the southern gaza strip the army razed the 
home of a palestinian accused of trying to firebomb a building 
thursday that houses the local council appointed by israeli 
authorities 
the message of demolishing the house must be clear to 
everybody anybody who tries to harm these people appointed arab 
officials will be caught and severely punished the army 
commander of the southern gaza strip said on israel radio he was 
identified only as col yitzhkad 
the unsuccessful attack occurred two days after the attempted 
assassination by stabbing of hassan tawil 74 the mayor israel 
appointed for el bireh in the west bank palestinian underground 
leaders have demanded that all municipal officials appointed by 
israel resign 
israeli military officials in the west bank said many students 
and palestinians who work in israel ignored the strike called by 
the united leadership of the uprising which is led by the 
palestine liberation organization 
school attendance was about 70 percent thursday compared to 
nearly 100 percent wednesday said olivier rafowicz a spokesman 
for the military government 
army radio said masked men entered west bank schools thursday 
and urged students to leave classes and demonstrate palestinian 
leaders had asked students to boycott classes 
spot checks showed several schools closed including some in 
east jerusalem and ramallah 
rafowicz said most of the 45000 west bank arabs working in 
israel reported to their jobs he had no figures for gaza 
arab doctors said soldiers killed ahmed hassan hawari 17 with 
a bullet in the head in sebastiya village near nablus the army 
said hawari was standing on a terrace and an officer shot him when 
the youth raised a large rock apparently to throw at soldiers 
dozens of protesters attacked soldiers with bottles and stones 
in the nablus market and the troops opened fire wounding two the 
army reported 
hospital officials said soldiers shot an 18yearold palestinian 
and a 12yearold girl in the legs at tulkarem the army confirmed 
one wounded 
the team of israeli doctors organized by dedi zucker a 
leftwing member of parliament said highvelocity bullets disperse 
in the body and shatter bones 
they work on the principle of the dumdum so it is much more 
damaging the bone fragments virtually act as bullets in the 
body said dr ruhama marton her reference was to softnosed 
bullets first made at the dumdum arsenal near calcutta india 
according to the report such bullets produced two 
quadriplegics 13 paraplegics and 20 cases of serious internal 
injuries 
the doctors accused soldiers of misusing tear gas by firing into 
closed spaces but said they could not determine whether tear gas 
had caused miscarriages 
bill lee of the un relief agency said last week that tear gas 
fired into confined spaces had killed 11 palestinians and caused 
dozens of miscarriages

colossus will get his first glimpse of 
another gorilla in more than 20 years when his gorilla girlfriend 
arrives next week from st louis on a breeding loan a zoo official 
said thursday 
colossus billed as the largest lowland gorilla in captivity at 
6foot2 and more than 550 pounds hasnt seen another member of 
his species since infancy when he was captured in west africa 
colossus and his soontobe girlfriend muke are both 22 prime 
breeding age for such apes said pat quinn director of the zoo 
which is near this pensacola suburb in western florida 
muke pronounced mookey arrives wednesday 
have i got a girl for him quinn joked 
to prepare colossus for his blind date scientists from the 
university of west florida have been showing him videotapes of 
gorillas 
he did respond quinn said he was most interested in 
gorillas that interacted with humans because thats what he is used 
to 
colossus has been the star attraction at the zoo since he took 
his first step into the outdoors at a gorilla compound march 18 he 
came to the zoo from bensons animal park in hudson nh where he 
had been kept in a small indoor cage since his capture 
an effort in new hampshire to produce offspring from colossus 
through artificial insemination failed because the huge ape wasnt 
very sexually active quinn said colossus has recently shown signs 
of more sexual interest 
gorillas are an endangered species and colossus is seen as 
particularly attractive for breeding because he was captured in the 
wild and will introduce a new gene pool into the community of 
captive apes

now we dont have any faith in the government zeni ametov 
a 35yearold tatar said in a telephone interview from his moscow 
home 
ametov said he was now in a state of shock and said crimean 
tatars tentatively are planning june 20 demonstrations in moscow 
and other cities to protest the decision 
the government announcement was a major setback for the ethnic 
group whose members have been agitating for a return from what 
they consider exile in central asia to their ancestral lands on the 
black sea 
a government commission headed by president andrei a gromyko 
was formed to study tatar grievances after activists staged an 
extraordinary 21hour demonstration in red square last summer 
the commissions report carried by the official tass news 
agency criticized groups of crimean tatars for insisting that 
the issue of creating a crimean autonomy be resolved first 
it said there has been greater employment and educational 
opportunities in the past year 
the issue of disgruntled ethnic minorities has been a sensitive 
one for soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev who has acknowledged 
that appeasing the countrys more than 100 national groups is among 
the soviet unions most pressing problems 
the crimean tatars as well as ethnic armenians have taken 
advantage of greater tolerance under gorbachev to stage public 
demonstrations 
the tatars were deported from their crimean homes after josef 
stalin accused them of collaborating with the nazis during world 
war ii 
tatar activists say about 110000 people or 46 percent of their 
population died during or soon after the deportation the rest 
were resettled in the ural mountains uzbekistan and kazakhstan 
the tatars who today number about 300000 were rehabilitated 
in 1967 but still not permitted to return en masse to the crimean 
peninsula 
the government statement noted that the soviet union has eased 
restrictions that barred some tatars from returning to the crimea 
since the middle of 1987 about 2500 crimean tatars have been 
granted resident permits and fixed up with jobs in the crimea 
the statement said 
in addition extra conditions have been created to develop 
their national culture and opportunities broadened to study their 
native language 
but ametov said crimean tatars who have moved back to their 
homeland have done so solely on their own initiative after lengthy 
battles with authorities 
there are some improvements but that is only through the 
efforts of individuals ametov said

a high school senior says he told classmates 
their graduation would be memorable but he just intended a 
practical joke not the violence feared by administrators who 
canceled final exams and graduation exercises 
neal loeslein 18 who witnessed a friends suicide denied that 
some students at fairview high school troubled by the death had 
made a suicide pact 
there wasnt one that was just a rumor he told the 
pittsburgh press in a story published thursday 
officials in fairview an affluent suburban erie county 
district decided earlier this week to cancel wednesdays finals 
thursdays baccalaureate service and sundays graduation for about 
150 seniors because they felt they could not guarantee the safety 
of students and guests 
an administrator who spoke to erie county newspapers on 
condition he not be identified said psychologists believed the 
threat of violence during graduation was real and they advised the 
board to cancel all events that would give the troubled students a 
forum to carry out their threats 
loeslein told the press he was the student present at 
christmastime at the home of another senior who fatally shot 
himself in the head with a 44caliber magnum he said talk of a 
suicide pact surfaced soon afterward and that the talk apparently 
intensified two weeks ago when he told classmates in a general way 
this is a graduation we will all remember 
loeslein said he had planned to play a practical joke at the 
ceremony but had not decided what it would be he said his remarks 
were misconstrued by classmates and officials 
an attempt by the associated press to reach loeslein by 
telephone thursday was unsuccessful because the family has an 
unlisted number 
requests for comment on loesleins remarks were referred to the 
school board solicitor frank kroto who did not return phone 
messages thursday 
after the suicide school officials called in experts from the 
university of pittsburghs western psychiatric institute and clinic 
to talk to students loeslein said his own counselor told school 
officials he was doing well but the pittsburgh counselors warned 
he was still troubled 
loeslein told the press he has had trouble with school officials 
for repeated rule violations his mother shirley loeslein said 
some teachers and students have an unfair opinion of her son 
after the student died the paranoia set in she said 
they were afraid that he loeslein might explode or something 
school administrators who spoke to the erie daily times and the 
erie morning news said the pittsburgh counselors diagnosed at least 
two unidentified students as suicidal and possibly homicidal 
we went from trying to protect several students from 
themselves to trying to protect the entire class and their parents 
from these disturbed kids one highranking administrator said 
kroto said several officials had received death threats but he 
would not be more specific 
state police capt douglas l greenfield in nearby girard said 
police were not asked for assistance until wednesday and a 
spokesman said thursday no complaint about any death threats had 
been filed 
state police said the homes of threatened administrators were 
the object of increased routine patrols and school board president 
barbara junker said the administrators have been offered whatever 
private protection they believe appropriate 
loeslein and other students said they know of at least one 
administrator in charge of discipline who was the object of 
written and verbal statements that could be misconstrued as threats 
i think they are totally overreacting loeslein said 
senior class officers donated their 800 class fund much of it 
intended for flowers and other graduation costs to create a 
special suicide prevention fund to be administered by the schools 
guidance department 
the officers thought this was the best way to do something 
positive class president gary guzzardo said

a house subcommittee completed public hearings 
thursday in the impeachment proceedings for us district judge 
alcee l hastings of miami with a woman contradicting the 
testimony of dade county mayor steve clark 
florreyn joyette royals a staff member of the metro miami 
action plan a civil rights organization said hastings did not 
talk to clark after a breakfast social meeting on sept6 1985 as 
the mayor had testified before the house judiciary subcommittee on 
criminal justice 
clark told the subcommittee on may 26 that after hastings had 
made a speech at the breakfast the judge stepped off the stage 
shook the mayors hand and told him to stay away from kevin 
waxy gordon against whom hastings had approved an fbi wiretap 
fbi agents testified last week that hastings had compromised the 
wiretap and caused them to close down three major corrpution 
investigtions in the miami area 
miss royals told the subcommittee that she was assigned to 
escort hastings to the meeting and back to his car after he had 
spoken she said hastings had told her he needed to be in court by 
1030 am and for her to see to it that he finished his speech and 
was on his way by 1015 am 
i started tugging at his coat at 1015 am said miss 
royals who said she was stooping behind the judge as he made his 
speech to the organization after his speech he left he went 
back through the catering area and went and got his car the only 
person he talked to was our executive director lanny sumptner who 
he shook hands with as he went out the front door of the hotel 
if he had shaken hands with mayor clark he would have had to 
jump over the podium and would have dragged me with him because i 
was tugging on his coattails said miss royals 
miss royals and the rev bryan o walsh a catholic priest in 
the miami diocese testified on behalf of hastings as the judges 
only witnesses before the subcommittee closed its public hearings 
walsh said he talked briefly with hastings and clark together prior 
to the breakfast meeting 
hastings declined to testify before the subcommittee 
he said he believed the subcommittee would exonerate him of the 
charges but that he is personally relieved and prepared to go 
forward if the articles of impeachment are approved against him 
i am legally correct morally correct and spiritually 
satisfied said hastings after the hearing 
chairman john conyers dmich said he would leave the record 
open until next friday so that the defense could submit any 
documents or statements it wished to make 
conyers declined to say when the subcommittee would make a 
recommendation to the house judiciary committee on whether hastings 
should be impeached if hastings is impeached by the house the 
senate will conduct a trial to determine whether he should be 
removed from office 
in addition to the charge that he compromised the three 
investigations by leaking the fact that the fbi had a wiretap 
hastings also is accused of conspiring with washington lawyer 
william borders to receive a bribe in exchange for modifying the 
sentences of two convicted racketeers 
borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a 150000 bribe for 
hastings was sentenced to five years in prison and was fined 
35000 in a separate trial hastings was acquitted of the bribery 
conspiracy charges

announcement of the first program to 
distribute hypodermic needles to drug users has sparked a debate 
between those who say the plan will curb the spread of aids and 
those who say it will encourage drug use 
its like trying to put out a fire with gasoline said lon 
mabon executive director of the oregon citizens alliance a 
conservative political group opposed to the project 
outsidein a portland social service agency will use a 67000 
grant from the american foundation for aids research to conduct the 
nations first test to determine if exchanging used needles for 
new sanitary ones will curb the spread of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome sharing needles has been one of the main ways 
for transmitting the human immunodeficiency virus that causes aids 
to qualify for the program a person will have to admit 
intravenous drug use show identifiable injection marks and have a 
needle to exchange for a new one participants who can remain 
anonymous will receive periodic blood tests and counseling 
in a way its a hook to get drug users reconnected to the 
helping system while seeing if it doesnt decrease the spread of 
the hiv virus said bradley j woodworth president of 
outsideins board of directors 
but mabon criticized it as sending a wrong message it seems 
very contradictory on one side of our government and society to say 
drugs are wrong and then to be handling out needles he said 
mayor bud clark said the needle exchange is worrisome and 
might be interpreted as encouraging drug use at a time when the 
city is making great efforts to eradicate drugs he called for 
researchers to make public results of the program as soon as 
possible 
gov neil goldschmidt also has some reservations about the 
program said press aide gregg kantor any time you appear to 
make these drugs easier to take it worries him kantor said 
that doesnt necessarily mean the governor opposes the idea 
kantor said 
well have to wait and see what the results show and whether 
it makes sense or not kantor said it may in fact help 
reduce the spread of aids 
rosanna creighton executive director of citizens for a drug 
free oregon a group that lobbies for antidrug laws questioned 
whether drug addicts would participate in the program 
if you look at the history of their lifestyle and behavior 
patterns it doesnt look like a strong possibility she said 
woodworth said a similar program in scotland showed drug users 
were willing to travel up to two miles to get clean needles 
there may be some who are totally unsalvageable were trying 
to find out if theres a percentage of people whose behavior can be 
modified 
dr lester wright the states top public health officer said 
he thinks the needle exchange program is worth a try 
wright who is deputy administrator of the state health 
division rejected arguments that the program will encourage drug 
use 
drug use is unhealthy its stupid and its illegal but it is 
happening he said i dont see a need to make it any more 
fatal than it already is 
because of the aids problem i think we have to look at 
anything that could reduce its spread and evaluate whether it 
works wright said 
several critics expressed fears that the program would hurt 
portlands reputation 
this whole free needle thing is just one more nail in the 
coffin as far as our image said mayoral candidate ron still a 
former police chief 
legal opposition has been holding up a similar program in new 
york city in massachusetts state lawmakers on wednesday debated a 
needle distribution program in boston 
woodworth said portlands comparatively low aids infection rate 
among drug users 5 percent compared to 60 percent in new york 
makes the city an ideal location for the project 
this is a city where its not too late to see if it makes a 
difference he said

the house banking committee approved 
legislation thursday to make it more difficult for drug dealers and 
other criminals to hide their profits 
the bill would require banks to file transaction reports for all 
cashiers checks money orders and travelers checks of 3000 or 
more now banks need to file such reports on transactions of 
10000 or more 
the measure would also authorize law enforcement agencies to 
inspect the records of bank insiders suspected of being involved in 
criminal activity against the bank without the targeted people 
being tipped off the financial privacy act now requires such 
persons to be told when agencies are looking at their record 
the legislation would also authorize the treasury secretary to 
target an individual institution in a geographical area for 
additional recordkeeping where drug activity is heavy and large 
cash sums are being generated

a pair of wild pigs that wandered off 
course got hit by an f16 fighter forcing the pilot to eject as 
the jet veered off a runway and crashed at jacksonville 
international airport 
the pigs were killed the pilot was bruised the 16 million jet 
was destroyed 
lt col sam carter was rolling down the runway at 160 mph after 
landing when saw a brown blur and felt a bump before his air 
national guard jet veered toward a ditch and a stand of pines late 
tuesday night 
carter who has flown jets for more than 24 years including 
sorties over vietnam ejected before the aircraft plowed into the 
woods the remains of a pair of wild pigs were found scattered on 
the runway 
its a very inglorious way for a 16 million aircraft to come 
to an end said carter bruised but otherwise uninjured it was 
the first time he had ever bailed out of an aircraft 
carter whose career includes 9 years in the air force and 15 
years with the air national guard said wednesday that he has heard 
his fill of oinker jokes including his wifes offer to let him pig 
out at a pork dinner 
air force investigators were at the scene thursday 
airport officials said they planned to check for breaks in the 
airport fence which is designed to keep animals off runways wild 
pigs are common in florida 
carter 46 of orange park had completed a training mission 
over the atlantic ocean and returned to the airport 
col don garrett commanding officer of the florida air national 
guards 125th fighter interceptor group said the pigs must have 
been struck by the planes left landing gear causing the aircraft 
to veer sharply and leave the runway 
the gear broke off probably after the plane ripped through a 
ditch before crashing into the pine trees he said 
he carter made a quick and timely decision to eject you 
never know when youre leaving a prepared surface if the plane 
could turn upside down when it started heading for the trees he 
decided to eject garrett said 
the rocketpowered ejection seat carried carter 200 feet into 
the air barely high enough for his chute to open carter said the 
parachute blossomed just before his feet hit the ground 
he landed about 100 yards from where the aircraft came to rest 
in the splintered pines 
you dont expect that sort of thing he said

a federal herbicide expert said thursday he 
was forced out of his job for refusing to recommend use of a 
plantkilling substance against cocaineproducing plants in south 
america 
walter gentner 66 former national technical adviser on 
narcotics said he decided to take early retirement rather accept a 
demotion from his agriculture department post 
at issue is a preliminary plan by the government to use 
tebuthiuron known informally as spike to eradicate coca 
plants in peru and other andean countries 
eli lilly amp co the indianapolisbased manufacturer of the 
herbicide decided late last month not to sell the product to the 
us government for use against coca plants 
this prompted an angry reaction last week from the state 
department which said the safety and effectiveness of spike has 
been clearly demonstrated and defended by the company it said 
numerous environmental tests have been carried out in compliance 
with federal regulations 
on thursday state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
appeared to back away from the earlier department statement by 
asserting that the herbicide is still being tested by the us and 
peruvian governments 
rep glen english dokla had expressed outrage over lillys 
decision last week calling the company a deserter in the war 
on drugs but an aide to english said thursday that the 
congressman after conferring with lilly officials agreed that 
there were environmental concerns that need to be met 
gentner who first told his story to national public radio and 
spoke thursday in a telephone interview from his maryland home 
said his experience was a reflection of the tremendous pressure 
to do something about drugs 
but we need the facts before we go and do something 
irreversible said gentner whose 39year career with the 
agriculture department ended several weeks ago 
he said spike is manufactured in pellet form and is ideal for 
use along railroads and highways but he said the herbicide may not 
be safe if it is applied to wet soils which are later drenched by 
heavy rains in that case the pellets could roll downhill and 
affect plants outside the target area he said adding that 
cocaproducing areas in the andes often have an inch of rain a day 
expressing sympathy for lillys position gentner said a 
cocaeradication campaign in south america would represent only a 
small part of lillys overall operation 
but if the herbicide proved to be ecologically damaging lilly 
could be faced with a wave of liability suits and give the product 
a black mark affecting its marketability in the united states 
and elsewhere 
the washington times reported in wednesdays editions that an 
epa report concluded that the toxic effect of spike and two other 
products under consideration in the antidrug war have not been 
fully evaluated 
gentners boss thomas army deputy administrator of the 
agricultural research service did not immediately a call thursday 
seeking comment on gentners allegations but army told the 
washington times that gentner wasnt aggressive enough 
you got to get after it with a sense of urgency army said 
mrs oakley said the herbicide is widely used in the united 
states and brazil and that lilly stands by the safety of its 
product 
but a lilly spokesman ted mckinney said thursday the herbicide 
is safe only when used according to labeled directions for 
approved purposes 
lilly has not tested tebuthiuron for use in controlling coca 
nor has the company tested tebuthiuron under the actual conditions 
found in peru he said

somali troops executed dozens of men and 
destroyed homes of suspected rebel sympathizers in a town where at 
least 1000 people were killed or wounded in recent fighting 
foreign aid workers said thursday 
the workers who were airlifted from the northern somali town of 
hargeisa and arrived in nairobi on wednesday could not give an 
accurate count of the number killed or wounded in fighting that 
began with a moonlit rebel attack may 31 they also could not say 
how many were civilians soldiers or rebels 
however the accounts depicted bloodier hostilities than have 
been admitted so far by the prowestern government of maj gen 
mohammed siad barre 
jean metenier 28 a french technician working for the german 
emergency doctors humanitarian organization said he saw dozens of 
bodies around hargeisa somalias second largest town including 
almost two dozen corpses of young men in civilian garb found behind 
his house 
the soldiers would make summary trials and then execute 
them said metenier whose house was next to that of gen mohamed 
morgan siyad somalias northern army commander and barres 
brotherinlaw they were all in civilian clothes and all young 
men 
metenier said he did not witness the executions but heard the 
gunfire and counted 21 bodies between may 31 and june 2 
he said troops driving bulldozers scooped up five of the bodies 
behind his house one day and dumped them on a street corner a block 
away 
mentenier also said about 1000 wounded were admitted to the 
hargeisa hospital in the first five days of clashes 
probably most of them were soldiers metenier said of the 
wounded i think in town a lot of people have been injured 
mostly civilians 
six evacuees seated with metenier at nairobis norfolk hotel 
corroborated his accounts of fighting atrocities and the 
destruction of homes of suspected rebel sympathizers but they 
would not speak individually to reporters 
an american aid worker ron wieland of dazey north dakota said 
a shell went through the window of his house when government troops 
chased rebel forces up a dry river bed running alongside his 
compound wieland 36 said no one in his house was injured but 
that the situation warranted evacuation 
metenier said the fighting was fiercest in the town center and 
on gennet one of the nearby hills the government was shelling 
daily with tanks bazookas and mig19 aircraft he said 
he said about 5000 people lived on the slopes of the hill the 
site of the state national refugee commission compound 
food stores other supplies trucks and equipment were kept in 
the compound where the commission coordinated the distribution of 
relief aid to 350000 ethiopian refugees in 15 northern somali 
camps including hargeisa he said 
he said that even if emergency stocks and transportation had not 
been destroyed in the government bombardment of the hill the 
fighting had closed off the road to the camps cutting off the 
refugees lifeline 
metenier also said rebels had taken control of a small power 
plant about 12 miles outside hargeisa which operated the water 
pump he said hargeisa had been without water since the first few 
days of the rebel attack 
the rebels intensified their offensive in may one month after 
an agreement between ethiopia and somalia in which the horn of 
africa nations agreed to cease support and sanctuary to insurgents 
fighting each others government 
the rebels of the somali national movement which took up arms 
against the government in 1981 claim to control barao a town of 
50000 people 110 miles east of hargeisa the hargeisa airport and 
three nearby garrison towns 
siad barre seized power in a 1969 military coup the united 
states is somalias staunchest ally 
the evacuees who spoke were among 165 foreign aid and relief 
workers airlifted from hargeisa last friday and saturday in a 
uncoordinated airlift that angered the government

president reagan said thursday that americas 
problem with drug use in the workplace stems in part from students 
of the 1960s and 1970s who experimented with illegal substances and 
retained their destructive drug habits 
in many ways our country is still paying for the erosion of 
our values and the decline in selfresponsibility that occurred in 
the 1960s and the 1970s reagan said in a speech to corporate 
leaders trying to drive drugs from the work site 
the students of that period who used illegal drugs in high 
school or college have in many cases taken their destructive drug 
habits with them into their places of employment reagan said 
drug users at the workplace reagan said pose a threat to 
their coworkers and represent a corporate crisis and a national 
catastrophe 
first lady nancy reagan in a separate speech indicated that 
she agreed 
for years young people were the biggest advocates of drug 
use today young people are much more aware of the dangers mrs 
reagan said in a speech to the world gas conference 
today the real advocates of drug use are the aging holdovers 
from the 1960s and 1970s mrs reagan said 
the president said that what was once defended as a victimless 
crime is costing america billions of dollars a year in lost 
productivity 
in his speech to the national conference on a drugfree 
workplace reagan did not advance any new steps to combat drug 
abuse 
the cabinetlevel national drug policy board is deliberating 
proposals to take away student loans and deny drivers licenses for 
anyone convicted of using drugs and impose federal penalties for 
drug dealing near public housing projects 
but sources say the panel is split and that education secretary 
william j bennett is trying to steer the administration away from 
adopting such harsh proposals 
reagan did not mention the panels proposals 
the president said there are limits on what can be 
accomplished in fighting the supply of drugs so the battle 
against drugs must be directed against the user 
because so long as there is a demand for illegal drugs there 
will be a powerful financial incentive for drug traffickers to 
satisfy that demand reagan said 
the president said he believed there has been a major change 
of attitude in america about drug use and that the momentum has 
shifted from those who celebrated the drug subculture to those who 
just say no and help others do the same 
it is this change in attitudes that i believe makes total 
victory in the war on drugs not just possible but ultimately 
certain reagan said 
the national drug policy board also is considering whether to 
endorse withholding federal aid from state and local governments 
colleges and universities and other publicly financed institutions 
if they dont adopt the antidrug proposals which are still in the 
discussion stage 
under current law educational institutions receiving federal 
aid are required to certify that they have drug abuse prevention 
programs 
attorney general edwin meese iii chairs the policy board but 
bennett is trying to steer the reagan administration away from some 
of the proposals according to administration sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
bennett who favors increased use of the military as an 
antidrug measure has expressed doubts that the current proposals 
would be effective the sources have said 
a spokesman for the department of education loye miller 
declined to comment on bennetts views 
policy board members are discussing having student loan 
recipients sign a document stating that being a convicted drug user 
can mean loss of the loan 
they also are discussing making it a federal crime to sell drugs 
near public housing similar to the federal schoolyard law making 
it a federal crime to sell drugs in the vicinity of schools 
another proposal under discussion at the policy board calls for 
state governments to refuse to issue firsttime drivers licenses 
to minors who have been convicted of drug use the federal 
government would enforce this by threatening to withhold federal 
transportation funds

the bestdressed students at two public elementary 
schools could be in blueandwhite uniforms this fall as principals 
try to stifle fashion rivalry and tighten discipline 
the dade county school board adopted the voluntary program 
wednesday for the martin luther king and charles r drew elementary 
schools in liberty city 
a study by the school principals found overwhelming acceptance 
of the uniforms and school officials anticipate a high rate of 
cooperation 
drew and king are the first public schools in dade to adopt 
uniforms but the practice has taken hold elsewhere in baltimore 
where four public schools adopted uniforms last year the outfits 
were so successful in raising selfesteem ending fashion wars and 
improving discipline that 35 more schools will follow suit this 
fall 
the uniforms at drew and king will be jumpers or skirts and 
blouses for girls and trousers shirts and ties for boys uniforms 
for lowincome students will be donated by private companies 
when they wake up in the morning when they look in that 
closet they are going to know what theyre going to wear and 
theyre going to come to school focusing on the basic skills

the supreme court on thursday cleared the way 
for the imprisonment of former us intelligence analyst samuel 
loring morison convicted of espionage and theft 
the court by a 63 vote denied morisons emergency request to 
remain free pending a formal appeal of his conviction 
chief justice william h rehnquist had turned down morisons 
request on june 2 and morisons lawyers then turned to justice 
william j brennan for help 
after brennan referred the request to the full court a federal 
trial judge in baltimore ruled that morison could remain free until 
june 15 while the full court considered his bid to stay out of 
prison 
presumably us district judge joseph youngs order now will be 
set aside and morison will have to begin serving a twoyear term 
the supreme court order issued thursday was one sentence it 
said the application for continued release from detention 
presented to justice brennan and by him referred to the court is 
denied 
justices brennan thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun 
dissented they voted to let morison remain free until the court 
acts on his formal appeal 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld the conviction in 
april rejecting morisons arguments that congress intended laws 
against spying to protect against the distribution of classified 
material to a foreign government rather than leaks to the press 
morison grandson of the late pulitzer prizewinning naval 
historian samuel eliot morison was convicted in october 1985 of 
giving to janes defence weekly photographs taken by a us spy 
satellite of a soviet nuclear aircraft carrier under construction 
morison who worked as a civilian for the navy also was 
convicted of the theft of the photos and government documents 
describing a may 1984 explosion at the soviet unions severomorsk 
naval base 
he was sentenced to two years in prison but remained free under 
100000 bond pending appeal 
prosecutors said morisons actions endangered national security 
because the photos revealed how a us spy satellite worked they 
also said he leaked the photos to get a fulltime job with janes 
after doing parttime work for the military journal while employed 
by the navy 
defense attorneys contended morison was trying to educate the 
public about a soviet navalbuildup and that the photos told the 
soviets nothing they had not learned already from a 1978 incident 
in which the spy satellites operations manual was sold to a soviet 
agent 
the case is morison vs us a876

the senate voted 6927 thursday to choke off a 
filibuster that has blocked action on a bill permitting the death 
penalty for major drug dealers who kill police officers 
the decision sets up a vote on the bill friday that supporters 
and opponents agreed probably would result in approval 
this sends the message that were not going to tolerate the 
kind of warfare were seeing on the streets of our cities sen 
alfonse damato rny chief author of the bill told his 
colleagues 
but opponents such as sen daniel evans rwash derided the 
measure as an electionyear attempt to appease public demands to do 
something about illegal drugs they also noted the death penalty 
already exists in many states and it hasnt deterred drug pushers 
once again were going for an electionyear slam dunk on 
drugs evans said noting that a similar bill was proposed in 
1986 were taking precipitous steps to indulge our own political 
vanity 
thursdays tally was nine votes more than the 60 needed to 
invoke cloture the parliamentary device used in the senate to end 
a filibuster opponents began an effort to talk the measure to 
death after damato originally attached it as an amendment to the 
defense budget bill 
but damato dropped his amendment on the defense bill two weeks 
ago leading to senate approval of that measure in return for a 
promise by senate democratic leaders to allow floor action on a 
separate death penalty measure 
senate approval would send the bill to the house where it faces 
an uncertain future it would go to the house judiciary committee 
which has in the past steadfastly refused to send such a measure to 
the floor 
damatos bill provides that the death penalty can be imposed on 
people who are convicted in federal courts of running a drug ring 
and who are then separately convicted of killing law enforcement 
officers or private citizens it applies to federal laws but could 
also be followed by individual states 
before invoking cloture the senate killed 6531 a proposed 
amendment that would have imposed a penalty of life imprisonment 
without parole instead of the death penalty for persons convicted 
under the terms of damatos bill 
while the senate was debating new york mayor edward i koch was 
calling for the use of military forces to halt drug trafficking and 
suggesting that the federal government should open tent jails in 
nevada to help relieve prison overcrowding caused by drugrelated 
arrests 
we want the navy with the air force on the high seas to 
detect apprehend and arrest drug smugglers koch told a hearing 
by two house armed services subcommittees 
the panels are looking at proposals approved separately by the 
house and senate to increase the militarys role in the antidrug 
effort 
koch called for repeal of the posse comitatus act the 1878 law 
barring the military from enforcing civilian laws its 
ridiculous get rid of it he said 
he also noted prisons are too crowded now and suggested the 
federal government should open up tent jails out in nevada 
nevada wont like it 
he was willing to split the cost with the us government if 
the feds opened up additional jails as i hope that they will 
well pay onethird koch said he endorsed creation of a federal 
surtax with the new money to be devoted solely to antidrug 
programs 
meantime president reagan said the nations problems with drugs 
in the workplace arise partly from students who used illegal 
substances in the 1960s and 1970s and who have retained 
destructive drug habits 
in many ways our country is still paying for the erosion of 
our values and the decline in selfresponsibility that occurred in 
the 1960s and the 1970s the president said in a speech to 
corporate leaders trying to drive drugs from the work site 
the students of that period who used illegal drugs in high 
school or college have in many cases taken their destructive drug 
habits with them into their places of employment reagan said 
earlier thursday the house banking committee approved 
legislation making it more difficult for drug dealers and other 
criminals to hide their profits 
the bill would require banks to file transaction reports for all 
cashiers checks money orders and travelers checks of 3000 or 
more now banks need to file such reports on transactions of 
10000 or more

a sharp increase in errors by air traffic 
controllers at chicagos ohare airport comes at a time when such 
mistakes nationwide have been declining steadily federal aviation 
administration officials said thursday 
faa administrator allan mcartor directed an agency team to join 
an investigation into why the number of controller errors have 
increased at ohare the independent national transportation safety 
board this week sent a team to look into controller operations at 
chicago because of the soaring number of controller miscues 
we may have a team out there two or three weeks faa 
spokesman john leyden said of the agencys ohare investigation 
the ntsb investigation was prompted by reports that there have 
been 20 controller errors at the ohare facilities so far this year 
compared with 12 such errors for all of 1987 
during the first four months of this year operational errors by 
controllers throughout the faa air traffic control system declined 
by 12 percent according to the agency leyden said there were 345 
such errors from january through april compared with 393 during 
the same four months of 1987 
an operational error occurs whenever a controller allows two 
aircraft under his direction to fly closer than regulations allown 18 
percent increase in errors 
during the first half of 1987 following two years of decline the 
number of errors dropped in the in the second half of 1987 
resulting in the number of errors increasing only slightly for the 
full year 
the national trend in controller errors is downward said 
leyden 
but the ohare tower and its radar room have repeatedly over the 
years been a trouble spot for the faa in recent years the ohare 
facilities have been investigated by faa teams from washington the 
ntsb and congressional committees 
the tower handles planes in and out of ohare which last year 
had nearly 789000 aircraft takeoffs and landings the radar room 
handles aircraft within a 30mile radius of the airport including 
overflights and approaches and departures to and from chicago 
some 112 controllers work at the two facilities 27 fewer than 
authorized and only about half of them are classified as being 
fully qualified to work at all air traffic positions according to 
the faa 
mcartor this week directed that eight additional controllers be 
assigned to handle traffic at ohare because of the expected 
traffic volumes this summer 
but unusual jumps in controller errors is nothing new at ohare 
according to an investigation last year by the house government 
operations committee the number of errors at ohares tower 
increased to 23 in 1986 from only 14 the previous year 
that increase also came at a time when controller miscues 
nationwide were declining

low and moderateincome families would 
receive taxfree interest on savings bonds used to pay for college 
under a bill proposed thursday by the reagan administration 
the college savings bond act of 1988 was sent to capitol hill by 
education secretary william j bennett and treasury secretary james 
a baker iii 
for families with adjusted gross incomes under 60000 interest 
earned on the bonds would be taxexempt if the proceeds were used 
to pay for college tuition or related expenses by the bondholder 
spouse child or dependent 
the tax benefit would be reduced for families earning between 
60000 and 80000 and eliminated entirely for households with 
incomes above 80000 
the treasury department estimated lost federal revenues would 
total 11 million in fiscal year 1989 and gradually rise to 284 
million by fiscal year 1994 the bonds would be available starting 
jan 1 
in a statement bennett said college savings bonds would be a 
safe and convenient higher education investment for millions of 
americans and for their children 
an education department spokeswoman said the administration bill 
would be formally introduced within the next few working days by 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan and rep john duncan 
rtenn the senior republican member of the house ways and means 
committee some 50 cosponsors are expected on the house side said 
department spokeswoman jane glickman 
the administration proposal is similar to a more generous bill 
introduced last fall by sens edward kennedy dmass claiborne 
pell dri and robert stafford rvt 
under their plan no taxes would be due on interest earnings 
used for educational purposes if the taxpayers income was below 
75000 the tax benefit would decline gradually to zero at the 
150000 income level 
kennedy said at the time it had been estimated that if 1 million 
families each bought 500 in bonds and held them for 15 years 
under his bill the tax revenue lost when the bonds were redeemed 
would be 845 million 
lawmakers and others have been seeking ways to help families 
cope with rising higher education costs citing a 75 percent hike 
since 1980 and a major federal shift from grants to loans in the 
student aid area 
vice president george bush when he launched his campaign for 
the gop presidential nomination last year said he wanted to be 
known as the education president and suggested the college 
savings bonds approach

the judge in the irancontra case abruptly 
canceled a closed pretrial hearing thursday following prosecution 
complaints that the defense had improperly subpoenaed cia justice 
department and white house documents 
us district judge gerhard a gesell also quashed the subpoenas 
issued for documents that showed how officials at the three 
agencies were briefed and prepared for questioning by the grand 
jury that investigated the irancontra affair 
gesells order came a day after six news organizations filed a 
motion to open the proceeding to the public on grounds that the 
judge had not sufficiently justified keeping it closed 
the hearing which gesell had scheduled for next monday was to 
have been held to determine whether government agency lawyers had 
used the immunized congressional testimony of three of the 
irancontra defendants to prepare officials for questioning by the 
grand jury 
the possible exposure of grand jury witnesses to the immunized 
congressional testimony of fired national security council aide 
oliver l north former national security adviser john m 
poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim is an issue before gesell 
the defense contends that the staff of independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh and grand jurors were exposed to admissions the 
three defendants made to congress under limited grants of immunity 
and therefore the case must be dismissed 
walsh contended in court papers that the defense improperly 
served oppressive subpoenas calling for documents beyond the 
scope of the ordered hearing in an effort to obtain internal 
governmental materials some of them privileged which this court 
has twice previously ruled that the defendants should not now 
have 
in april gesell took similar action to quash defense subpoenas 
for similar material and penalized defense lawyers by barring them 
from presenting testimony at an earlier hearing on the immunity 
issue 
during that proceeding the defense was allowed to crossexamine 
walsh who testified about procedures he had implemented to prevent 
his staff and grand jurors from being exposed to the immunized 
testimony gesell also quashed subpoenas ordering other members of 
walshs staff to appear at the hearing 
this time gesells response was to cancel the hearing it was 
not immediately clear whether he would hold another proceeding 
later 
but gesells action appears to make moot a motion by two 
television networks and four newspapers to open the hearing to the 
public 
after he originally scheduled the proceeding gesell explained 
in an order he was closing the hearing because it is expected the 
testimony may to some extent involved classified materials and to 
some degree relate to matters of attorneyclient privilege 
the news organizations contended that the mere fact that 
certain material may be classifed is not in itself sufficient to 
warrant automatic closure of an entire hearing 
at most it would justify exclusion of the press and the public 
from that portion of the hearing at which classified information 
was discussed said the brief filed by cbs abc the new york 
times the los angeles times the wall street journal and the 
washington post

infected women be vaccinated to prevent 3500 babies a year from 
becoming potentially doomed hepatitis carriers 
it is now evident that routine screening of all pregnant women 
is the only strategy that will provide acceptable control of 
mothertochild hepatitis b transmission the centers for disease 
control said 
each year in the united states about 16500 babies are born to 
mothers with hepatitis b infections about 3500 of those infants 
become chronic hepatitis b carriers and it is estimated that more

an experimental birth control vaccine shows 
promise for blocking pregnancy for six months without significant

the vaccine spurred the immune systems of women volunteers into 
making proteins called antibodies that block the action of a 
hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin which is produced 
during pregnancy 
the vaccines effectiveness could not be tested directly because 
the women had been surgically sterilized but animal studies had 
shown that an antibody attack on the hormone could halt a pregnancy

nancy reagan said thursday that a first lady 
must be a stone wall when it comes to looking after her 
husbands health and if that interferes with affairs of state 
then so be it 
mrs reagan in a speech to the world gas conference said no 
first lady need make apologies for looking out for her husbands 
welfare 
although mrs reagan made no reference to former white house 
chief of staff donald t regan her remarks were clearly directed 
at the critical portrait he painted of her in his recently 
published book for the record 
the book disclosed that mrs reagan consulted an astrologer for 
aid in helping prepare her husbands schedule regan also portrayed 
the first lady as controlling access to the president in the weeks 
following his prostate surgery in 1985 and having engineered 
regans ouster in the aftermath of the irancontra affair 
mrs reagan has refused to comment directly on the assertions in 
regans book during a tour of leningrad at last weeks ussoviet 
summit reporters had a chance to question her and she replied 
everything has been said about that that needs to be said 
in her speech mrs reagan made no mention of astrology 
her address largely echoed a similar speech she delivered last 
spring when she defended her role as her husbands protector 
several weeks after regans departure from the white house 
no matter what is written about her theres one thing on 
which any first lady must be a stone wall the first lady is first 
of all a wife she said thursday 
speaking of his hospitalization she said i believe my 
husband has as much right to a normal recuperation as any other 
husband and i think its an important legitimate role for a first 
lady to look after a presidents health and wellbeing and if that 
intereferes with affairs of state then so be it 
the first lady also likened her life as a highwire existence 
and i wouldnt trade the experience for even extra years added to

the senate passed and sent to president reagan 
on thursday legislation that would limit the use of liedetector 
tests by private employers 
the legislation which was approved 6824 also would prevent 
employers from taking adverse actions against employees solely on 
the basis of the test results 
sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor 
committee said the legislation will put an end to decades of 
injustice 
kennedy said the measure carefully balances the interests of 
employers and employees based on the known scientific evidence 
regarding lie detectors and their potential for abuse 
judy goldberg representing the american civil liberties union 
said the bill will protect thousands of workers who are currently 
being labeled as liars by these machines that dont work 
the house approved the bill last week on a 251120 vote 
the office of technology assessment estimated that two million 
polygraph tests were administered in 1987 with 90 percent given by 
private employers most of those tested were job applicants 
although tests also were given to workers under investigation 
twentytwo states prohibit the tests in the private sector and 
19 regulate private use of the tests 
the accuracy of test results has been questioned and so has the 
competency of some examiners 
the compromise legislation which followed passage of separate 
polygraph bills by the house and senate would permit private 
sector testing of applicants for only two types of jobs 
those applying for security guard positions could still be 
tested and so could prospective employees who would have direct 
access to the manufacture storage distribution or sale of 
controlled substances 
in addition an employer could test an employee during an 
ongoing investigation involving economic loss or injury to the 
company 
however the employee must have had access to the property that 
is the subject of the investigation and the employer must have 
reasonable suspicion that the worker was involved in the incident 
before the test began the worker would have to have been given 
specific information about the incident under investigation 
only the federal government would be permitted to administer 
tests to those employed by assigned to or detailed to the 
nations intelligence agencies and to fbi contract employees 
to protect the rights of workers the bill would prohibit an 
employee from being discharged dismissed disciplined 
discriminated against or denied employment or promotion solely on 
the basis of the test or solely because of his refusal to take the 
test to take action against the worker an employer would have to 
have additional supporting evidence 
questions on religious or political beliefs could not be asked 
questions would have to be submitted to the test subject in writing 
before the examination the examinee could end the test at any time 
qualification standards would be set for examiners who would 
need a license granted by the state if one were required by the 
state the examiner also would have to maintain a 50000 bond 
the legislation would take effect six months after it became law

two alabama businessmen told congress on 
thursday they were processing imported shrimp under instructions 
from the commerce department when their plants were raided in april 
by armed customs service agents 
dj ficarino sr an owner of mobile freezers inc and joseph 
e ladnier president of sea pearl seafood co said they had been 
informed by commerce officials that they could label imported 
shrimp as a us product once they peeled deveined and repacked 
the shrimp 
if i though i was doing something illegal i would have sure 
locked up my doors and done it at night ficarino said i 
certainly wouldnt do it in broad daylight 
the customs service however decided that the two shrimp 
processors as well as a third south alabama company gulf coast 
white knight were illegally labeling imported shrimp as a product 
of the united states and on april 13 agents raided the three 
plants and seized about 600000 pounds of shrimp worth several 
million dollars 
the shrimp processors according to rep sonny callahan rala 
were caught up in an unfortunate bureaucratic snafu that 
resulted from differing interpretations by two us government 
agencies of the same law 
that law permits an import to be labeled as a product of the 
united states if it undergoes substantial transformation 
between the time it is imported and the time it is placed on the 
market for sale to consumers 
the national marine fisheries service a division of the 
commerce department had advised shrimp processors that peeling and 
deveining of shrimp constiuted a substantial transformation 
the customs service disagreed 
at thursdays hearing before the house energy and commerce 
investigations and oversight subcommittee us attorney jefferson 
b sessions iii of mobile ala said he decided not to prosecute 
the three shrimp processors because the advice they received from 
the commerce department removed the element of criminal intent 
sessions said however that he agreed with the customs service 
that peeling and deveining imported shrimp does not constitute a 
substantial transformation of the product 
james w brennan assistant administrator for fisheries at the 
commerce department acknowledged his agency had provided 
misleading and inaccurate information to the south alabama 
shrimpers 
but brennan said that for the past 35 years shrimp processors 
all along the gulf coast have been placing product of the us 
labels on imported shrimp they have peeled and deveined and he 
said his department received no notification from the customs 
service prior to the april raids that such a practice now was being 
considered illegal

a securities industry representative offered a 
compromise thursday in an attempt to head off legislation that 
would bar securities firms from requiring customers to settle 
disputes through industrysponsored arbitration 
the finance subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee is reviewing a proposal that would prohibit firms from 
forcing customers to waive their right to sue in court as a 
condition of opening a brokerage account 
william j fitzpatrick general counsel of the securities 
industry association said securities firms like any other 
business have a right to set the terms under which they are 
willing to do business 
that includes the right to demand that customers sign a 
socalled mandatory arbitration clause binding them to settle 
disputes before an arbitration panel sponsored by a stock exchange 
or other market organization he said 
fitzpatrick said if there is a problem with customers 
unknowingly signing such agreements the industry would have no 
objection to offering a separate document disclosing the 
arbitration clause and explaining its terms 
however rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the 
subcommittee argued that mandatory arbitration properly disclosed 
or not is inherently unfair and oppressive 
investors like all the rest of our citizens believe they 
have a right to their day in court he said 
markey said a survey by the staff of the securites and exchange 
commission showed that 95 percent of the nations top retail 
brokerage firms require customers to sign arbitration clauses when 
they borrow money from the firm on margin 
ninety percent of the firms require the clauses for customers 
who trade options and 38 percent require the clauses for cash 
accounts an additional 32 percent intend to begin requiring the 
clauses for cash accounts 
no ones holding a gun to a customers head what is going on 
is a sort of benign neglect and a hurried process where the 
customer signs an arbitration clause without really knowing what he 
is doing said g richard shell a professor of legal studies at 
the university of pennsylvania 
he termed the industrys argument that customers are voluntarily 
choosing arbitration when they give up their right to sue a kind 
of trick 
the industry is getting something and the customer is getting 
nothing because the customer always has the right to arbitrate 
regardless of whether they sign the agreement shell said 
the legislation being considered by the subcommittee would also 
bar people with connections to the industry from serving on 
arbitration panels and it would give arbitrators the power to 
compel securities firms to produce documents relevant to the case 
boyd page an atlanta arbitration attorney said firms often 
stonewall document requests or produce them only at the last 
minute 
the sec plans to vote july 7 on whether or not to endorse a ban 
on mandatory arbitration clauses three of its five members have 
said they support such a ban

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
said thursday the soviet union wants to restore diplomatic 
relations with israel but will not do so until the israelis agree 
to an international conference on middle east peace 
he spoke to reporters after his first meeting with prime 
minister yitzhak shamir who leads israels rightwing likud bloc 
and firmly opposes such a conference 
both sides said a consular team will go the the soviet union 
next month on the first visit by israeli diplomats since the soviet 
union broke diplomatic relations during the arabisraeli war of 
1967 a soviet consular team now is in israel 
shevardnadze and shamir said there were no breakthroughs in the 
meeting shich lasted just 10 minutes short of two hours but 
described it as friendly productive and useful 
it does not signify a new stage in relations but it was a 
useful meeting shevardnadze said if we are able to convene a 
conference that would make it possible to settle the problem of 
our relations with israel 
he and shamir were here for the special general assembly session 
on disarmament it was shamirs first session with a high soviet 
official since he met in 1984 with andrei gromyko then foreign 
minister 
israel has sought a resumption of relations for years and the 
kremlin has stepped up contacts in hopes of increasing its 
influence on middle east peace negotiations 
the soviet foreign minister has met with foreign minister shimon 
peres who approves of a peace conference and of trading occupied 
arab territory for peace which shamir opposes 
perez who leads the centerleft labor party and shamir are 
partners and rivals in israels tenuous coalition government 
elections are due in november 
what role the consular team will play in moscow is not clear 
israeli officials indicated the diplomats might issue visas to 
soviet jews wishing to emigrate but shamir told israel radio he 
did not know whether they would be allowed to deal with jewish 
matters 
shevardnadze answered no when asked whether the israeli team 
would issue visas there is a certain frame in that agreement and 
the israeli prime minister and foreign minister and the group 
itself are well aware of what that understanding is he said 
without elaborating 
our team was well received in tel aviv and normal conditions 
were created for their work we shall try to do likewise for the 
israeli group 
emigration of soviet jews is continuing he said and there 
are no obstacles but some constraints he identified the 
constraints as military secrets only 
shamir told israeli reporters later that shevardnadze said the 
situation of soviet jews will improve and the special communist 
party meeting scheduled for june 28 will consider the problems of 
jews 
answering a question about an international peace conference 
shevardnadze said israel must accept a conference before we can 
restore ties these are interrelated elements let us convene a 
conference and let us also hold serious discussion on settling our 
relations 
shamir said he told shevardnadze our relations are not 
normal we want an embassy in moscow and you should have an 
embassy in israel he said shevardnadze agreed but said the 
solution was a peace conference 
the israeli prime minister wants direct talks with israels arab 
adversaries he contends israel would be outnumbered at an 
international conference and pressured to make concessions 
he told the israeli reporters it would be difficult for the 
soviet union to play a constructive role in a middle east 
settlement without having normal relations with israel

two house committees on thursday approved 
legislation that would sever virtually all economic ties between 
the united states and south africa to pressure the pretoria 
government to abandon its policy of racial apartheid 
the measure was approved by the intelligence and armed services 
committees both meeting in closeddoor sessions after amendments 
were added that would permit the united states to share 
intelligence information about cuban military activities in 
southern africa and permit military cooperation with south africa 
if the president determines such ties to be in the national 
interest committee aides said 
the bill which still must clear two more committees before it 
can go to the full house for action would require us 
disinvestment in south africa within a year and ban most trade 
between the two countries 
as originally written the bill also would have banned military 
and intelligence cooperation but the two committees added language 
creating an exemption for diplomatic activities and intelligence 
sharing concerning cuban activities in angola where usbacked 
rebels are fighting the marxist government 
committee aides said the exemption was granted in part to avoid 
having the sanctions bill become a vehicle for a renewed debate 
over us support for the angolan rebels 
the armed services panel also approved an amendment by rep jon 
kyl rariz permitting military cooperation if the president 
deems it in the national interest 
both committees reported the bill out on voice votes 
the measure still must clear the ways and means and interior 
committees before being considered by the full house where it is 
expected to pass the measure is expected to have a tougher time in 
the senate however because it lacks the republican support which 
was crucial to passage of a limited sanctions bill two years ago

the senate appropriations committee gave 
voicevote approval thursday to an 1805 billion fiscal 1989 
spending package for water and energy development programs 
the bill totalling 92 million less than president reagan 
requested is noteworthy because it contains no money for new 
construction starts by the corps of engineers and the bureau of 
reclamation 
the nonewstarts posture is identical to the stand taken by the 
house last month when it approved its energy and water 
appropriations bill for the year starting oct 1 
hundreds of dams harbor improvements and irrigation systems 
would continue to get money for operation and maintenance and work 
would continue on dozens now under construction 
the senate and house bills would also apply the nostarts 
stricture to the superconducting super collider the huge 
highenergy physics installation that would enable scientists to 
delve deeper into the nature of matter 
both bills would provide 100 million to continue preliminary 
research for the ssc but they would bar the start of construction 
on the multibillion dollar project in fiscal 1989

representatives of nasa and the defense 
department began discussions thursday to decide which agency will 
get the first batches of rocket fuel when the sole supplier of a 
key ingredient gets back in business next week in nevada 
kerrmcgee corp has announced it will resume manufacture of 
ammonium perchlorate monday at its henderson plant which shut down 
under public pressure may 12 eight days after an explosion 
destroyed a competitors plant nearby 
in nevada meanwhile seeking to alleviate concerns about the 
dangers of continuing manufacture of the fuel gov richard bryan 
ordered weekly inspections of the kerrmcgee plant by the state 
division of occupational safety and health 
bryan said he wont try to block resumption of operations but 
that he will work with federal officials to minimize the amount of 
ammonium perchlorate stored at kerrmcgee 
kerrmcgee and pacific engineering amp production co were the 
only producers of ammonium perchlorate an oxidizer used in the 
space shuttle booster rockets and in such military rocket programs 
as the navys trident the armys stinger and the air forces 
peacekeeper mx minuteman titan 34d and delta 
the national aeronautics and space administration lost the fuel 
for two shuttle boosters when the pacific engineering amp production 
co plant was demolished by a series of explosions that also killed 
two people it left the space agency with rocket sets for only four 
flights 
the fact that kerrmcgee is opening monday does help the 
situation said russ bardos director of shuttle propulsion for 
nasa the longer the delay in kerrmcgee opening up the more 
serious the immediate problem in terms of keeing the flow and 
processing moving on schedule 
bardos and george abbey the no 2 man in nasas space shuttle 
program is scheduled to meet again friday with representatives of 
other rocket users to allocate the fuel 
the ingredients in the fuel mix are different for each 
application and the priorities must be decided in advance bardos 
said it takes 10 days to two weeks to produce the 17 million 
pounds of fuel used by the shuttles 
nasa had scheduled nine shuttle flighs next year 
we have lost two batches in the pacific engineering explosions 
and we cannot recover those two batches in the next few months 
bardos said therefore there will be an impact on at least two 
flights 
but he cautioned that does not mean the shuttle can fly only 
seven times next year four of the first 11 postchallenger flights 
two this year are dedicated to secret air force cargo giving 
the pentagon an incentive to allocate some of its fuel to those 
missions 
anita bridges a kerrmcgee spokeswoman announced wednesday 
that agreement had been reached with the clark county nev fire 
department and state officials over the plants safety and are 
ready to resume production 
the impasse had threatened to block reopening of the plant 
because of fears of another explosion 
kerrmcgee hired a team of independent safety experts to inspect 
the plant and has done everything humanly possible to try to 
alleviate the fears and concerns of our operation the 
spokeswoman said

a decision by roman catholic officials not to 
expel two nuns who signed an advertisement challenging the churchs 
antiabortion stance may mark the end of the use of dismissal to 
quiet dissent one of the nuns said thursday 
i would like to hope that its the beginning of a process for 
our community and others to begin to look at the question and 
to look at the question of choice for women sister patricia 
hussey told a news conference its about our right to dissent 
and our right to dissent publicly on the issue of choice 
i think also that dismissal would never again be used as an 
instrument to quiet dissent she said it is not helpful it is 
not lifegiving and in fact its very draining and not for the good 
of our congregation and not good for the church 
hussey and barbara ferraro members of the general government 
group of the sisters of notre dame denamur were under threat of 
expulsion from the order after they refused to recant opinions in 
an oct 7 1984 advertisement in the new york times which bore 
their signatures 
the full page advertisement which noted the churchs position 
that abortion is never permissible said there is a mistaken 
belief in american society that this is the only legitimate 
catholic position it also said a diversity of opinion exists 
among committed catholics on the issue of abortion 
shortly after publication of the advertisement the 22 nuns and 
four priests who signed the statement were asked to recant or face 
dismissal from their religious orders because hussey and ferraro 
refused to do so they expected to be dismissed 
last saturday the order issued a statement from the vatican 
saying it will not proceed with the process to dismiss the nuns 
we were as astounded on saturday upon hearing the decision 
hussey said i think they seriously listened to women in our 
religious community who said dismissal and the threat of 
dismissal is violent its nongospel and its nonchristian 
the nuns who work with the homeless in charleston wva at 
the covenant house acknowledged that the vatican still has the 
final word and they could be excommunicated and their superiors 
dismissed 
hussey said she hoped the vatican would honor the orders 
decision and that we will be able to be respected as autonomous 
women in religious communities 
i hope the vatican clearly knows that dissent is extremely 
important to the life of the church and doesnt use its tactics as 
it has in the past to squelch dissent she said 
wouldnt it be wonderful if women now and men in the roman 
catholic church would not be fearful and would not be afraid to 
speak out on their positions ferraro said 
she cautioned however that those who go public could pay a 
price 
people need to realize it will not be without struggle it 
will not be without great personal cost and based on what we went 
through the past four years it just does not come easily

the number of students bused for integration in 
seattle will be halved by 1989 school officials said thursday 
after the first major city to desegregate its classrooms without a 
court order adopted a system to educate many pupils closer to home 
seattle is adopting a cluster school concept designed after one 
instituted in cambridge mass in 1981 the plan divides seattle 
into eight racially balanced clusters each with six to 10 schools 
from which parents have a controlled choice of schools 
michael alves a massachusetts consultant who has worked on 
similar efforts across the country pronounced the plan 
firstrate after it was adopted unanimously wednesday night by 
the citys sevenmember school board 
it will maintain desegregated schools it should work in a way 
that is fair and i think it is constitutionally defensible 
alves said 
seattles black civic leaders were among those who had to be 
convinced that changing the 10yearold busing plan would not mean 
a return to segregation 
lacy steele president of the seattle chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said he was 
impressed with the work done by superintenent william kendrick and 
his planners who spent two years on the cluster program 
the plan should result in less black students being bused 
because they have borne the brunt of the busing steele said 
we say on the surface it seems to be a fair plan 
kendrick hopes the plan which takes effect in september 1989 
will save money spent on busing and improve classroom learning for 
the districts 43400 students 
some schools will be closed and other programs consolidated to 
save as much as 2 million the first year and as much as 37 
million annually in future years kendrick said 
parents in each neighborhood would pick from two middle schools 
and two high schools several other schools still would be 
available to the whole city at each level with magnet programs 
attracting those desiring special approaches or concentrations of 
study 
depending on families choices the plan may be totally 
voluntary said donna dunning director of district relations if 
not school assignments will be made on a firstcome firstserved 
basis 
administrators say at most 4800 students will be bused for 
desegregation compared with between 10000 and 11000 now riding 
buses to keep a racial balance 
at a cost of 122 million per year of which the state pays 62 
percent a total of 22000 of the districts students are bused 
including some for special education english as a second language 
and preschool needs 
changes in the 10yearold desegregation plan also were needed 
because the minority population in the schools climbed from 35 
percent in 1977 to 525 percent this school year partly reflecting 
a white exodus to private and suburban schools official said 
its a plan that many people said needed major surgery 
kendrick said we will change the perception that kids are bused 
all over the countryside we will see kids coming back into the 
public schools from the private schools he said 
a major compromise made to meet concerns of some parents allows 
grandfathering to keep students entering grades three four 
six seven 10 and 11 next fall at the same schools 
the plan makes all grade schools teach through grade five and 
middle schools grades six through eight 
the new plan for the first time includes kindergartners in 
mandatory busing outside their neighborhood but that issue may be 
reconsidered school board members said 
john davis presidentelect of the seattle education 
association said the teachers union would closely follow how the 
district handles teacher and program transfers 
there are parts of the plan that are there in skeleton form 
and im interested in seeing how the flesh is added he said i 
have some real concerns about the whole new framework its going 
to create some initial chaos

artist george rodrigue said thursday he will 
have a oneday show on capitol hill of paintings that he had to 
smuggle out of the soviet union following his exhibition there 
rodrigue 43 of lafayette la attracted widespead attention 
when soviet officials ordered him during the moscow summit to 
remove from display his oil paintings of president reagan and 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev 
denied exit permits to take his exhibit out of the country 
rodrigue said he turned to the visiting news media to ferry his 13 
paintings back to the united states 
he said some americans traveling with reagans entourage 
volunteered to carry the paintings on air force two the plane that 
ferried the press rodrigue refused to identify the couriers but 
he said they didnt have to go through customs 
back in the united states rep bob livingston rla agreed to 
cosponsor the show on friday to allow the american people to see 
the paintings that the soviet people were banned from seeing 
no one answered the telephone at the soviet information office 
a message left on the recording machine was not returned 
rodrigue said his experience with soviet functionaries left him 
with a sour taste 
the ordinary people i met were real nice said the cajun 
painter but the soviet bureaucracy we could not deal with there 
was no negotiation 
rodrigue was invited to the moscow summit by a soviet delegation 
that hoped to create a louisiana theme 
during the summit 13 of rodrigues paintings including the 
oils of reagan and gorbachev were to hang in a restaurant at 
moscows international trade center where a louisiana chef served 
cajun food rodrigue said he was disappointed the soviet people 
could not enter the trade center without special passes 
the day after rodrigue put up the oils showing reagan as a 
cowboy on a white horse and gorbachev carrying a red flag soviet 
officials confiscated the paintings officials gave conflicting 
reasons for the action 
they asked why wasnt gorbachev on a horse he said 
then they said the paintings were too expensive then they 
asked why reagans painting did not have a sun in it 
the various reasons were real stupid rodrigue said the 
bottom line really is they didnt want the president hanging in a 
russian restaurant thats what i think 
but rodrigue speculated widespread media attention on the 
painting prompted the soviets to reconsider two days before he was 
to leave they rehung the two paintings 
then he said various officials tried to persuade him to donate 
the picture of gorbachev to the soviet union an offer rodrigue 
said he would grant only if he could personally hand the painting 
to the kremlin leader

the us embassy issued an urgent notice to 
americans on thursday after china warned that terrorists from 
another country may be planning attacks on americans living in the 
chinese capital 
the unprecedented warning caused the us embassy to issue an 
alert to the 1500 americans living in china that they should take 
measures to protect themselves said us consular official dewey 
pendergrass 
the embassy said highlevel chinese public security officials 
told the embassy wednesday of possible terror attacks on americans 
by an unspecified third country the chinese did not give specific 
information about the terrorists or what kind of attacks might be 
planned 
in washington a us government official said the chinese did 
tell us authorities that there was middle eastern involvement 
the state department has said in recent weeks that it suspects 
libyan involvement in a series of terrorist attacks in latin 
america and europe in april and may libya has envoys in china 
based at its peoples bureau or embassy 
asked if libya was suspected in the threat against americans in 
china the official in washington said the country involved was 
not specified the official spoke on condition of anonymity 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the department 
did not issue a travel advisory to tourists because it was a 
generalized threat and was issued only against americans living 
in beijing 
the embassy notice said officials believe this warning 
reflects a genuine threat and that american citizens in the beijing 
area should take appropriate steps to protect themselves 
a second memo distributed to embassy staff and american 
businessmen who held an emergency meeting thursday afternoon 
advised against frequenting areas known to be american hangouts 
and wearing clothes that are characteristically american 
were taking it very seriously pendergrass said at the 
meeting of the american chamber of commerce in beijing that was 
called to discuss the threat 
the embassy warning was sent to about 1100 americans in beijing 
and the port city of tianjin 60 miles away who have registered with 
the embassy however embassy officials say they believe 400 to 500 
americans mostly students are not registered 
security is good in the chinese capital which is considered one 
of the safer cities worldwide there have been no reported 
incidents of terrorists attacking foreigners or chinese 
a foreign ministry spokesman said thursday that the safety of 
foreign embassies and citizens in china is ensured 
li zhaoxing responding to reporters questions at a weekly news 
briefing said he was not aware of any discussions between chinese 
authorities and the us embassy on how to prevent possible 
terrorist attacks 
embassy spokeswoman sylvia b rifkin said the embassy has in the 
past sent out similar warnings based on worldwide alerts against 
terrorist but this was the first time the threat was directed 
specifically to americans in china 
your guess is as good as mine she said when asked who might 
be behind the threat 
the embassy warning recommended that americans avoid certain 
restaurants markets and nightclubs known to be gathering points 
for americans or foreigners and report suspicious incidents to the 
embassy 
a 15point advisory of personal security tips was 
distributed at the chamber of commerce meeting thursday 
it told americans dont daydream while traveling to and from 
work and that they should avoid public gathering places such 
as western hotel lobbies the airport and tourist restaurants it 
added that americans should not be lured into conversations with 
strangers and dont agree to meetings arranged through strange 
telephone calls or chance encounters

president pw botha on friday 
morning extended the nationwide state of emergency for a third 
year according to a presidential statement 
the statement came two days after blacks ended their biggest and 
longest general strike the extension takes effect upon publication 
friday in the government gazette 
botha said despite success in curtailing violence and unrest he 
believed ordinary laws were still inadequate to ensure public order 
and safety 
it is indeed the aspiration of the government that conditions 
will change to such an extent that the declared state of emergency 
can be lifted botha said in the statement 
intimidation and terror are aimed at undermining the 
political economic and social activities of all our communities 
it is also being employed to disrupt our courts and legal 
procedures he said 
there were no immediate details of any possible changes in the 
emergency regulations which allow sweeping powers of detention 
outlaw many forms of peaceful antigovernment protest and restrict 
freedom of speech press and assembly 
we might just as well prepare ourselves for a permanent state 
of emergency independent member of parliament jan van eck told a 
gathering in johannesburg earlier thursday a minority regime 
will not be able to govern this country without the very wide and 
very aribitrary powers afforded by these state of emergency 
despite banning of apartheid groups and restrictions on their 
leaders more than 2 million blacks stayed away from work school 
and shops from monday to wednesday 
the action left streets deserted in major cities such as 
johannesburg and durban and cost the economy about 250 million 
according to the associated chambers of commerce 
botha first issued the nationwide decree on june 12 1986 after 
two years of daily violence that claimed 1700 by mid1987 the 
violence lessened but not after an additional 2500 people died in 
township political violence security force action and in strikes 
and other protests against the governments apartheid policies 
about 100 bombings and land mine explosions have taken place in 
the country in the past two years most of them blamed on the 
outlawed african national congress the anc is waging a sabotage 
campaign to end white domination of the government and apartheid 
legislation which separates the races and restricts where the 26 
million black majority may live attend school work and play 
although the violence has considerably subsided except for

at 25 years after george wallaces 
stand in the schoolhouse door at the university of alabama one 
in 10 of its students is black and on thursday the school 
sponsored a forum on race relations 
the conference attracted more than 300 academics alumni and 
journalists harry knopke a university official who helped plan 
it said the event would mark the anniversary with something 
positive productive and informative 
since wallaces showy futile attempt to block two blacks from 
enrolling at the state campus black students and faculty members 
agreed that much progress has been made at the university 
three blacks sit on the 15member board of trustees five blacks 
have been elected homecoming queen and one black as student 
government president and black fraternities and sororities are on 
the picturesque fraternity row 
i like going to school up here said laura tate a black 
senior from selma she said race relations on campus are a 
considerable improvement over her hometown where she said 
incidents of racial hostility were commonplace 
but theres always room for improvement she said of the 
university 
tate recalled her sophomore year when her sorority alpha kappa 
alpha was greeted by a burned cross when they moved into a house 
on allwhite sorority row two white male students later were 
suspended for the cross burning 
when we acquired the house they didnt like it but i think 
now people have just gotten used to us being there she said 
the university did react and deal with it in a very forthright 
manner said rhoda e johnson who heads the womens studies 
department she credited the university for efforts to deal with a 
problem many institutions have ignored 
at least we are trying to deal with the issue of race 
relations at the university thats a far cry from a lot of other 
places she said 
the first black graduate vivian malone jones finished in 1965 
ten years later 10 percent of the schools students were black 
the figure dipped in the early 1980s and remains at about 9 percent 
of a student population now 16000 strong 
knopke executive aide to the university president said the 
school has succeeded by systematic recruiting that reaches out to 
alabama students as early as ninth grade 
the schools black enrollment is significantly greater than that 
of it crossstate football rival auburn university which had a 
35 percent black enrollment in 1986 
like many other schools alabama has had a difficult time 
attracting black faculty members knopke said about 25 percent of 
the schools faculty is black a figure the school is trying to 
increase 
its a common goal for both the adminstration and the 
departments he said were interested in a setting here that 
fosters multicultural development thats what a university is all 
about thats how people learn 
jarrod bentley a black senior from birmingham agreed 
i think alabama has better prepared me to live in the real 
world he said in deciding on a college i wasnt thinking 
well wallace stood in the door 25 years ago i was thinking 
about getting an education 
bentley an accounting major said he has at times witnessed and 
felt discrimination at the university 
im not blaming it on the university or the state of 
alabama he said america itself still has a long way to go

air force investigators picked through 
wreckage thursday for clues to the cause of a plane crash that 
killed six air national guardsmen as they completed a series of 
touchandgo landings 
the c130 transport plane plunged into a soybean field and burst 
into a fireball about a mile short of the greenville airport on 
wednesday afternoon 
investigators are looking for important pieces of wreckage 
things that could give us a clue to what happened said maj jim 
bates a spokesman for little rock ark air force base where the 
plane had left about 1 pm wednesday theyll be able to get an 
indication of what the impact was like 
using search lights rescued workers pulled the last two bodies 
from the wreckage of the fourengine turboprop about 130 am said 
col dennis wood interim head of the investigating team 
at a news conference thursday wood said investigators believe a 
student pilot and an instructor were at the controls when the plane 
crashed 
wood said the plane had just completed a touchandgo landing at 
the civilian airport and was returning for another in a scheduled 
training exercise 
the planes approach would have completed the exercise said lt

republican presidential candidate george bush on 
thursday branded michael dukakis as an outofthemainstream 
politician using moderate tones in an attempt to attract voters 
inclined toward change 
after eight years of one party in the white house no matter 
how successful some good people will yearn for a change hoping 
that change means improvement bush told the republican state 
convention here 
its our job to let them know that this time in this case 
change and improvement comes from the incumbent the incumbent 
vice president 
in his most detailed pointbypoint attack on the massachusetts 
democrat his certain opponent in the fall bush said dukakis would 
raises taxes harass americans with irs audits weaken national 
defense and advocate an isolationist foreign policy 
dukakis communications director leslie dach scoffed at bushs 
contentions 
given where george bush is in the polls i think its no 
surprise that hes chosen to spend his time mudslinging and tearing 
down he said 
shortly before his speech to delegates assembled at the george 
r brown convention center the vice president told reporters he 
was shifting his campaign into a more aggressive stance 
im going to spell out the differences i will do it 
factually i will do it fairly i want to get it all together he 
said 
in the speech interrupted several times by applause bush said 
at issue this year are two completely different visions of our 
country and where its going the vice president told delegates 
to the texas state gop convention 
bush said he believes he will do well this fall despite polls 
showing him trailing dukakis because he will run a 
lookattherecord campaign 
he said he and president reagan inherited a sick country when 
they were sworn into office in 1981 with the economy suffering 
from stagflation and the united states suffering foreign policy 
defeats abroad 
the patients back on his feet and better than ever bush 
said and now who do we hear knocking on the door but the doctors 
who made him sick 
bush charged that dukakis would raise taxes and step up internal 
revenue service audits of citizens with or without justification 
governor dukakis operates from the premise that most americans 
must be guilty of tax cheating he said i operate from the 
premise that most americans are innocent and shouldnt be hassled 
on foreign policy bush accused dukakis of favoring a policy of 
retreat on the support of burgeoning democracies around the world 
while opposing development of new us weapons systems 
the vice president said the soviets would never have negotiated 
a mediumrange missile treaty if there had been the sort of nuclear 
freeze that dukakis advocates he also chided dukakis for 
advocating greater reliance on multilateral bodies such as the 
united nations to advance us foreign policy interests 
hesoldstyle 60s liberalism on crime bush said of 
dukakis 
bush claimed that dukakis lacks experience to make practical 
decisions affecting taxes and the overall economy 
when i wanted to learn the ways of the world i didnt go to 
the kennedy school at harvard i came to texas he said i 
didnt go to a symposium on job creation i started a business i 
didnt study a monograph on the effects of economic growth i met a 
payroll 
my opponent is an articulate defender of a flawed world view 
a man who holds strong convictions and who speaks in moderate 
tones he said but his views and values are too often in my 
view out of the mainstream 
earlier at a news converence bush said he didnt put much 
stock in polls showing him behind michael dukakis because i am 
convinced the country doesnt want to swing left politically 
yeah i dont worry about it the vice president said when 
asked to comment on a newly released texas poll showing him leading 
dukakis in his adopted home state by only 7 percentage points 
i feel really relaxed about it i really do he said 
were not playacting here i like fighting back 
bush said he had no quarrel with the way his campaign is being 
run although he acknowledged that there will be some changes 
along the way 
campaign manager lee atwater while sidestepping the question of 
whether treasury secretary james a baker iii would be soon 
arriving to head the campaign strongly suggested that such a move 
is in the offing 
my sense is that everybody would love to see jim baker as 
campaign chairman he said my idea is that anytime that hed 
like to come wed love to have him

michael dukakis the allbutsure democratic 
presidential nominee met thursday with costa rican president oscar 
arias and said the united states should encourage democracy in 
central america through economic assistance instead of military 
force 
the massachusetts governor also attended harvard universitys 
commencement took his wife home from the hospital where she had 
spinal surgery six days ago and spent several hours catching up on 
state business 
dukakis meanwhile came under attack from republican george 
bush who spoke to republicans at a texas state convention in 
houston bush attacked the massachusetts governor for 
oldstyle60s liberalism whose views are out of the 
mainstream 
its clear that the vice president doesnt think that his own 
record or vision can bring him the votes he needs in november 
retorted dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
dukakis was speaking at a thursday night victory party 
celebrating his tuesday primary victories clinching enough 
delegates to assure his nomination dukakis campaign meanwhile 
continued a lowkey search for a running mate amid quiet 
preparations for the democratic national convention in july 
dukakis who has been critical of reagan administration central 
america policies told reporters after meeting with arias that if 
elected he would develop a new relationship based on repect 
with the regions leaders 
we did have an opportunity once again to talk about concerns 
that he has and i have and all of us have about central america 
about his leadership in bringing peace to the region and about the 
opportunity economically for development said dukakis who held 
a similar meeting with arias several months ago 
arias in boston to deliver a commencement address at harvard 
laughed when asked if he would endorse dukakis for president he 
said he would do business with whoever you decide to send to the 
white house 
he then referred to dukakis fluent spanish and said perhaps 
its easier we can get along in the same language that helps 
dukakis speaking in spanish to a television reporter traveling 
with arias said efforts to remove panamas gen manuel antonio 
noriega from power should be centered on negotiations that involve 
central american leaders 
the governor said the reagan administration has failed to 
consult with arias and other leaders in the region during efforts 
to persuade noriega who is under us indictment on drug charges 
to step down 
at massachusetts general hospital dukakis stood by as his wife 
kitty thanked the hospitals doctors and staff for caring for her 
during her hospitalization after surgery to repair herniated discs 
in her neck 
mrs dukakis said her doctors told her she could remove her neck 
brace by next month when her husband formally accepts the 
nomination at the democratic convention 
outside the hospital dukakis smiled and refused to answer when 
asked to comment on jesse jacksons assertion that he deserved to 
be offered the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket because of his 
strong performance in the primaries on wednesday dukakis said 
jackson deserved consideration but not a guaranteed offer 
while dukakis spent the afternoon at his statehouse office 
campaign aides met to discuss strategy for weekend meetings in 
michigan where work is to begin on drafting the partys election 
platform a process that will involve negotiations with the jackson 
campaign deputy campaign manager jack corrigan will lead dukakis 
delegation to the meetings bringing with him most of the 
campaigns top issues advisers 
dukakis is to work at the statehouse on friday and attend the 
massachusetts democratic convention on saturday on sunday he is to 
address the nations mayors at a national conference in salt lake 
city dukakis will focus on the nations drug problems and their 
effect on families campaign aides said 
several members of congress are scheduled to visit with dukakis 
early next week before he heads to the south for three days of 
campaigning

the presidential contenders looked south thursday with democrat 
michael dukakis pledging a better relationship with central america 
and republican george bush traveling to texas and launching his 
harshest pointbypoint attack yet on dukakis 
in a news conference in his adopted hometown of houston bush 
said we differ the governor and i a great deal on domestic and 
foreign affairs he said he was eager to spell out those 
differences because i am convinced the country doesnt want to 
swing left 
bush who wrapped up the gop nomination in april met in houston 
with the hispanic caucus to the texas republican convention then 
went to the convention floor to address the delegates 
in his speech the vice president branded dukakis an 
outofmainstream politician with a flawed world view 
hesoldstyle 60s liberalism bush said of his 
democratic rival he said dukakis would raise taxes harass 
americans with irs audits weaken national defense and formulate an 
isolatinist foreign policy 
the dukakis camp quickly fired back defending dukakis record 
on crime and his plan to collect unpaid taxes before considering 
tax hikes 
its clear that the vice president doesnt think that his own 
record or vision can bring him the votes he needs in november 
said dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
recent polls show the vice president trailing dukakis by 10 
points or more but bush said he wasnt worried i feel really 
relaxed about it he said i really do were not playacting 
here i like fighting back 
in boston dukakis who mathematically locked up the democratic 
nomination with a fourstate primary sweep on tuesday held his 
second meeting with costa rican president oscar arias in as many 
months he urged the us government to encourage democracy in 
central america through economic assistance rather than military 
force 
we did have an opportunity once again to talk about concerns 
that he has and i have and all of us have about central america 
about his leadership in bringing peace to the region and about the 
opportunity economically for development dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor promised that if elected he would 
develop a new relationship based on respect with the leaders of 
central america 
arias asked by reporters if he wanted to endorse dukakis said 
im sure well be a good friend of whoever you decide to elect 
however noting dukakis ability to speak spanish fluently arias 
added perhaps its easier we can get along in the same 
language that helps 
dukakis discussion with arias who won the 1987 nobel peace 
prize for his central american peace plan also included current 
us problems with panamanian ruler gen manuel antonio noriega 
dukakis speaking in spanish to a reporter traveling with arias 
said attempts to remove noriega should involve consultation with 
central american leaders consultation he said the administration 
has neglected 
arias and dukakis also took part in commencement ceremonies at 
harvard university where the costa rican president delivered the 
keynote address and the governor joined the schools procession 
earlier in the day dukakis escorted his wife kitty home from 
massachusetts general hospital where she underwent surgery six 
days ago to repair two herniated discs in her neck 
doctors said she will have to wear a neck brace while she 
recuperates but will be allowed to remove the brace by the time 
her husband formally receives the nomination at the democratic 
national convention in july 
outside the hospital dukakis refused to answer reporters 
questions about rival jesse jacksons contention that jacksons 
strong showing in the primaries warrants a vice presidential offer 
dukakis said wednesday that jackson will be considered but no 
candidate is due an offer 
jackson met thursday with his advisers at the la costa resort in 
california where the candidate was resting after a grueling 
campaign schedule in which he was on the stump nearly every day he 
has refused to concede the nomination to dukakis despite the 
governors apparently insurmountable delegate lead 
bush meanwhile endorsed newly passed legislation that would 
expand medicare to help the elderly deal with the high cost of 
serious illness the senate passed the bill 8611 on wednesday 
the legislation will for the first time since the 
founding of medicare extend benefits for our seniors the vice 
president said in a statement issued by his washington office 
now they do not have to live in fear that their lifes savings 
would be wiped out by a prolonged hospitalization 
in michigan a select group of democratic delegates met with 
representatives of the dukakis and jackson campaigns to find a 
common ground for the partys platform 
michigan gov james blanchard chairman of the democratic 
platform committee set up the meeting in hopes of writing an early 
draft that will help the party iron out its differences before the 
national convention begins in atlanta july 18

the leftist sandinista government and 
the usbacked rebels ended negotiations thursday without reaching 
an agreement on a permanent peace 
it is with deep consternation we announce that an agreement 
for a permanent ceasefire was not reached contra leader alfredo 
cesar said reading from a statement 
the talks ended after both sides exchanged proposals detailing 
measures for disarmament of the rebels and bringing democratic 
reforms to nicaragua 
cesar said a temporary truce would remain in effect but he would 
not say how long 
the war that our people have been suffering for seven years 
and that has almost stopped should not be renewed cesar said 
the nicaraguan resistance will not initiate offensive military 
operations 
he would not say whether further talks would be held 
there is no new meeting programmed he said we have 
reiterated our deep conviction to looking to solutions to the 
conflict in our motherland in a civilized way 
the talks thursday came on the final day of the fourth round of 
talks since the sides signed a ceasefire accord on may 23 the 
rebels and the government have been unable to work out the details 
by which the rebels would disarm and reforms would take place in 
nicaragua 
earlier thursday the rebels objected to parts of the 
governments proposal including the sandinistas amnesty plan and 
the lack of a definite time schedule for granting democratic 
reforms 
these are fundamental for the nicaraguan resistance and 
makes the difference between an agreement or no agreement cesar 
had told journalists 
the contras had maintained that thursdays talks were the last 
paul reichler an american lawyer working as a government 
negotiator told journalists sharp divisions among the contra 
leadership caused the talks to reach an impasse thursday afternoon 
he said he held several private meetings with cesar who told 
him the problems were with col enrique bermudez the ranking 
military leader 
he said bermudez would follow orders from the us state 
department and he called him colonel america reichler said 
reportedly relating a may conversation with cesar 
reichler also said he had met with cesar on may 23 in miami and 
said the two agreed on six demands by the contras for bringing 
democratic reforms to nicaragua he said those rebel demands were 
included in the sandinistas proposal 
we fully expected there would be an agreement two weeks ago 
based on what alfredo cesar told us reichler said cesar is 
unwilling now to accept the terms he proposed unless bermudez goes

candidates were aware of the illegal contributions us attorney 
robert bonner said at a news conference to reveal details of the 
indictment 
thirteen of karls former employees used as conduits for the 
alleged contributions were not indicted because most cooperated in

karllorimar home video to give an illegal 25000 contribution to 
a fundraiser entitled an evening with barbra streisand and robin 
williams

fondas first workout video which has sold millions of copies 
after selling his company to lorimar in 1984 for an undisclosed 
amount karl became president and chief executive of karllorimar 
home video division with an employment contract running through 
1989 
in march 1987 karl was forced to resign by lorimartelepictures 
following conflictofinterest allegations

the leftist sandinista government and 
the usbacked rebels ended negotiations thursday without reaching 
an agreement on a permanent peace 
it is with deep consternation we announce that an agreement 
for a permanent ceasefire was not reached contra leader alfredo 
cesar said reading from a statement 
the talks ended after both sides exchanged proposals detailing 
measures for disarmament of the rebels and bringing democratic 
reforms to nicaragua 
cesar said a temporary truce would remain in effect but he would 
not say for how long 
the war that our people have been suffering for seven years 
and that has almost stopped should not be renewed cesar said 
the nicaraguan resistance will not initiate offensive military 
operations 
he would not say whether further talks would be held 
there is no new meeting programmed he said we have 
reiterated our deep conviction to looking to solutions to the 
conflict in our motherland in a civilized way 
sandinista gen humberto ortega blamed the failure of the talks 
on the irrational positions of the contras 
the talks thursday came on the final day of the fourth round of 
talks since the sides signed an intitial ceasefire accord on march 
23 the rebels and the government have been unable to work out the 
details by which the rebels would disarm and reforms would take 
place in nicaragua 
earlier thursday the rebels objected to parts of the 
governments proposal including the sandinistas amnesty plan and 
the lack of a definite time schedule for granting democratic 
reforms 
these are fundamental for the nicaraguan resistance and 
makes the difference between an agreement or no agreement cesar 
had told journalists 
the contras had maintained that thursdays talks were the last 
paul reichler an american lawyer working as a government 
negotiator told journalists sharp divisions among the contra 
leadership caused the talks to reach an impasse thursday afternoon 
he said he held several private meetings with cesar who told 
him the problems were with col enrique bermudez the ranking 
military leader 
he said bermudez would follow orders from the us state 
department and he called him colonel america reichler said 
reportedly relating a may conversation with cesar 
reichler also said he had met with cesar on may 23 in miami and 
said the two agreed on six demands by the contras for bringing 
democratic reforms to nicaragua he said those rebel demands were 
included in the sandinistas proposal 
we fully expected there would be an agreement two weeks ago 
based on what alfredo cesar told us reichler said cesar is 
unwilling now to accept the terms he proposed unless bermudez goes 
along 
the government proposal presented thursday morning by humberto 
ortega called for a gradual political amnesty with the first 200 
prisoners freed after the signing of an agreement and the last 
coming on sept 28

an arab summit on the ploguided 
rebellion against israeli rule in the west bank and gaza strip 
ended thursday with agreement by rich arab nations to subsidize the 
uprising 
a communique issued at the end of the threeday summit said 
the conference stresses its full commitment to extend all support 
needed to secure the continuation and escalation of the uprising 
under the leadership of the plo 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat said he 
considered the outcome of the summit meeting a victory for both his 
guerrilla movement and the uprising 
arafat told a conference the funds alloted for the palestinian 
uprising were very convenient but he would not disclose 
figures 
eight delegation chiefs including the four wealthiest nations 
devised a formula in a 2hour meeting for subsidies to the 
palestinians and to syria and jordan which are in the forefront of 
the confrontation with israel 
in the communique the 21 arab league members again designated 
the plo as the sole legitimate representative of the 5 million 
palestinians 
they also agreed to oppose any peace initiative that excludes 
plo participation and to demand an international peace conference 
giving equal status to all concerned parties including the plo 
the communique noted the united states proisraeli bias and 
its hostility toward the arabs and the palestinians legitimate 
rights and said the summit condemned international terrorism 
in all its forms especialy israels organized terrorism against 
the palestinian people and the arabs in general 
it condemned iranian terrorism accusing iran of 
instigating internal unrest sabotage and other violence in the 
persian gulf nations and denounced irans refusal to end its 
8yearold war with iraq syria irans main arab ally expressed 
reservations a syrian source said 
sources close to the delegates said saudi arabia kuwait qatar 
and the united arab emirates agreed to specific sums that would 
be provided for the uprising and to syria and jordan 
chief plo spokesman bassam abu sharif told reporters however 
that the arab leaders agreed to keep the precise sums a secret to 
avoid showing their hand to the israelis 
before the report of an agreement sharif denied reports that 
arab leaders rebuffed the plo demand for funds to run the uprising 
there is no truth to the report 
arafat the plo chairman told the summit earlier in the week 
the rebellion was costing his organization more than 50 million a 
month in relief compensation for wages lost by strikers and 
medical expenses for injured rioters 
conference sources said the plo agreed in preliminary 
discussions to reduce its annual requirements to 300400 million 
but spokesmen for the oilproducing nations of the persian gulf 
said that still was too high 
gulf nations will provide funds for the uprising through the 
plo jordan and a plojordanian commission on palestinian affairs 
the sources said they said finances would be reviewed later 
possibly at the next regular arab summit scheduled for november in 
saudi arabia 
a senior delegate said later however that all money for the 
uprising would go through the plo that would underscore the 
renewed emphasis on the plo as the sole representative of 
palestinians 
the plo syria and jordan were expected to get some shortterm 
aid for their own use but the gulf nations avoided a longterm 
financial commitment they cited chaos in oil markets that 
endangered their main source of revenue 
at a 1978 arab summit in iraq oil states promised the plo and 
nations confronting israel a subsidy of 3 billion spread over 10 
years king hussein of jordan said in a speech wednesday he had 
received only about half the money syria and the plo also have 
complained about unfulfilled promises 
meanwhile syrian president hafez assad and lebanese president 
amin gemayel moved closer toward reconciliation after two meetings 
thursday focusing on lebanons 13yearold civil war sources said 
assad and gemayel have been at odds since january 1986 when the 
lebanese president scuttled a syrianbrokered accord between 
christian and moslem militias gemayel was not consulted before the 
signing of the agreement 
syria is the main supporter of lebanons moslems it has more 
than 25000 troops controlling the main moslem regions in the north 
and east as well as west beirut

prime minister rajiv gandhi of india said 
thursday weve had the means for almost 14 years now to make 
atomic weapons but well do our best not to do so 
however its difficult to say what sort of pressure we would 
come under in case pakistan did build a nuclear weapon he 
added in a cable news network television interview 
it was one of the bluntest public acknowledgments by any indian 
leader that indias lone atomic explosion in 1974 provided that 
asian country the capability for making nuclear weapons 
experts have said this was the case but official statements 
about the blast staged in the rajasthan desert by the government of 
the late prime minister indira gandhi rajivs mother have always 
stressed that it was merely a peaceful explosion of an atomic 
device 
rajiv gandhi succeeded his mother as prime minister after she 
was assassinated by sikh bodyguards outside her new delhi home in 
1984 
in other statements thursday in the united states and wednesday 
in bonn west germany the prime minister accused indias neighbor 
pakistan of aiding sikh terrorists he described as two big 
negatives of otherwise muchimproved indous relations the flow 
of american military aid to pakistan and what he termed americas 
looking the other way on pakistans nuclear program 
gandhi in new york for the united nations disarmament 
conference said during the cnn interview its very obvious that 
they pakistan have a nuclear weapons program 
they have a program which is based on wellsmuggled or stolen 
technologies he continued and its now pretty obvious to the 
whole world where these technologies are being stolen from and 
were sad that those countries who can control them put some 
pressure on them to stop this program are not doing so 
gandhis government has been urging the united states to stop 
granting waivers to pakistan under the us law barring american 
aid to countries developing atomic weapons 
attempts to smuggle nuclear technology or equipment to pakistan 
from the west have surfaced over the years last february a 
pakistanicanadian was sentenced to five years in prison after 
being convicted in philadelphia of trying to export illegally to 
pakistan special metals used in atomic bombs 
pakistan maintains that its nuclear program is solely for 
producing power and other peaceful uses 
before leaving europe on wednesday gandhi charged that by 
allegedly helping sikh extremists pakistan was perhaps the 
largest supporter of terrorism in the world 
disputing the idea that the sikhs of indias violenceridden 
punjab state deserve more autonomy he said they do have 
autonomy in the last election he said more sikhs voted than 
ever before

electionday violence left two people 
dead thursday raising to 12 the number of people killed in the 
islands southern province in the last three days 
most of the killings have been blamed on extremists of the 
sinhalese ethnic majority who oppose the elections to the southern 
district council 
many voters apparently were discouraged by the violence despite 
the presence of thousands of police and members of other security 
forces 
an election commission official said turnout reached a low of 15 
percent at some voting stations the province has more than 12 
million registered voters 
he said winners of the 53 council seats contested by 166 
candidates would be announced friday 
one of the victims thursday was a government official fatally 
shot while taking food to election workers police reported 
special arrangements for feeding workers were made because many 
shops and hotels closed in response to threats from the sinhalese 
extremists 
police shot a sinhalese youth to death when he tried to set fire 
to a stateowned bus near tangalle 90 miles south of colombo 
district councils are a provision of a treaty sri lanka and 
india signed in july in an attempt to end a separatist war by 
rebels of the tamil ethnic minority more than 8000 people have 
been killed during the fiveyear conflict 
rebels were to lay down their arms in exchange for more autonomy 
in the tamildominated northern and eastern regions but the 
largest group refused and india has sent in more than 50000 
soldiers to fight the insurgents 
the peoples liberation front extremists from the sinhalese 
majority contends the peace agreement made too many concessions to 
tamils and has said its men will kill anyone who supports the 
accord 
authorities have blamed 325 killings on the group since the 
agreement was signed including the deaths of 24 candidates in the 
seven district council elections held so far 
tamils most of whom are hindus make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million population and claim discrimination by the 
majority sinhalese a predominantly buddhist group 
india became involved because it is the main power in the 
region hinduism is the dominant religion among its 800 million 
people and it has a tamil minority of 60 million in southern tamil

three inmates shot a guard and took two hostages 
thursday while escaping from one of canadas oldest and most 
notorious prisons 
the guard at laval institute was seriously wounded but the 
hostages were later released in apparently good condition said 
paul fournier a spokesman at the federal maximumsecurity prison 
just north of montreal 
the hostages a woman prison guard and the driver of a car the 
inmates commandeered outside the prison were found walking on a 
road about 20 miles southeast of the prison 
fournier said earlier the guard taken hostage was believed 
wounded by gunfire but later denied it 
police throughout the montreal area launched a search for the 
inmates 
the breakout began thursday morning in the prison paint shop 
rene st arnaud 26 serving a 12year sentence for armed 
robbery his brother pierre 24 doing seven years for robbery and 
robert henley 29 serving a life sentence for murder overpowered 
the woman guard on a walkway overlooking the workshop and took her 
hostage 
the inmates began using a forklift truck to get over the wall 
of the 115yearold prison but they were spotted by other guards 
gunfire was exchanged fournier said 
the guard who was shot was hit in the shoulder and leg the 
spokesman said 
once over the wall the convicts stopped a passing car took the 
driver hostage and headed toward montreal 
fournier said eachguard at the sprawling prison is armed with a 
handgun and semiautomatic rifle names of the two hostages were 
not immediately released 
the medievallooking prison has seen many dramatic escapes and 
riots in september 1986 286 prisoners caused 500000 damage in a 
rampage to protest living conditions 
in july 1986 five inmates escaped through a network of air 
shafts and tunnels and emerged through a manhole cover outside the 
walls 
nine prisoners held eight hostages during a threeday 
disturbance in august 1980 in which one convict was killed 
the prison was slated for demolition in 1971 but reopened three 
years later because of a lack of prison space elsewhere

a federal appeals court agreed thursday to 
reconsider its landmark ruling that struck down the armys ban on 
homosexual soldiers 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals granted the reagan 
administrations request to refer the case to an 11member panel 
for a hearing 
the action removes the legal effect of the feb 10 ruling in 
which a panel of the court ruled 21 that 1981 army regulations 
providing for discharge on the grounds of homosexual orientation 
were unconstitutional 
in the process the court said homosexuals as victims of 
historic mistreatment were entitled to the same constitutional 
protection against government discrimination as racial minorities 
no other appellate court had ever reached that conclusion 
the armed services right to base discharges on homosexual 
conduct has been upheld by the courts but the appeals court in a 
case involving a discharged soldier from the seattle area said the 
armys regulations went further into the realm of personal privacy 
by applying to sexual orientation regardless of conduct 
the government contended the ruling failed to defer to the 
armys judgment in matters of discipline and morale and also was 
inconsistent with the supreme courts 1986 ruling upholding an 
antisodomy law in georgia 
the 25judge appeals court did not state a reason for referring 
the case to an 11member panel or give details of its vote no date 
was set for a hearing 
an official of a gayrights legal group described thursdays 
decision as a momentary setback 
the initial decision was cause for celebration said leonard 
graff legal director of national gay rights advocates in san 
francisco the struggle for equal rights for lesbians and gay men 
is a longterm struggle realistically we have to expect some 
setbacks that doesnt mean we give up 
the case involves perry watkins 39 who enlisted in the army in 
1967 at age 19 and said he had homosexual tendencies his lawyer 
james lobsenz said he was disappointed but not surprised by the 
decision and expects the case to wind up in the supreme court if 
he wins the next round 
thats why i did not advise homosexual members of the army 
after the february decision to come out of the closet and say 
here i am you cant touch me said lobsenz 
at the time watkins enlisted the army discharged soldiers for 
sodomy and other specific acts but not for homosexuality itself 
however homosexual orientation was declared grounds for discharge 
under regulations adopted in 1981 nearly 1400 people were 
discharged from all the armed services for homosexuality in the 
fiscal year that ended last sept 30 the government said 
watkins who had been supervisor of the fort lewis personnel 
administration center and had high job ratings was discharged in 
may 1984 in the feb 10 ruling the court said the army must 
reconsider watkins application for reenlistment without regard to 
his sexual orientation 
watkins said then that he would like his old job back but he 
was blocked from reenlisting pending the governments appeal 
laws that limit the acceptable focus of ones sexual desires 
to members of the opposite sex like laws that limit ones choice 
of spouse or sexual partner to members of the same race cannot 
withstand constitutional scrutiny absent a compelling governmental 
justification said the majority opinion by judge william norris 
joined by judge william canby 
norris held that the armys argument that homosexuals would hurt 
morale and discipline was an attempt to illegitimately cater to 
private biases 
the dissenter from februarys ruling judge stephen reinhardt 
condemned the 1986 supreme court ruling upholding a georgia 
antisodomy law but said the high court had set a precedent 
against recognizing constitutional protections for homosexuals 
watkins said he wasnt surprised by the courts action and said 
he expects the case to go to the supreme court if the army doesnt 
relent 
the ruling is so broad it affects too many people for the 
army to let it go watkins said in a telephone interview from his 
tacoma home 
what people need to start looking at is this kind of ruling 
doesnt affect just people who are gay if the army can do this to 
people because they want to then they can do it to anyone for any 
reason he said

vietnams foreign minister said thursday 
that vietnamese who worked for the united states during the war may 
go to america if there are assurances they will not mount attacks 
on their native country 
since south vietnam fell and the country was reunified in 1975 
about 900000 former south vietnamese officials and us employees 
have undergone political reeducation according to the state 
department 
we have declared that we are ready to let them go if there is 
a guarantee for our security said foreign minister nguyen co 
thach that means they must not be allowed to have hostile 
activities focused toward vietnam 
he told reporters at a breakfast news conference that some 
tens of thousands of people may be leaving and that us and 
vietnamese officials agreed to meet in hanoi in july to discuss 
security guarantees and other details 
on thursday thach met with retired army gen john w vessey 
jr president reagans special envoy on this and other 
humanitarian issues involving vietnam 
i have asked gen vessey if he would like to have all the 
people who cooperated with south vietnamese president nguyen van 
thieus army and he said that would be too much said thach 
he reiterated vietnams pledge that by 1990 it will withdraw all 
its troops from neighboring cambodia which it invaded in late 1978 
to topple the khmer rough government of pol pot both vietnam and 
cambodia are communist countries 
if vietnam is not out by 1990 we could be bogged down forever 
in cambodia said thach 
we were there originally with more than 200000 soldiers we 
have withdrawn 82000 to 87000 he said adding that 50000 more 
will be withdrawn this year 
it is estimated that 2 million people a fourth of cambodias 
population died in executions famine and civil war from 
19751979 under the radical khmer rouge communist regime 
thach said vietnams troops will leave even if there is no 
political agreement for a transition government but added with 
a political settlement you can have security 
he also indicated that vietnam will not invade again even if pol 
pot returned to power 
the western countries condemned pol pot from 19751978 when 
vietnam recognized pol pot and we have criticized pol pot with 
arms after that we were criticized by the west if pol pot returns 
again it is the responsibility of the western countries to 
criticize him said thach 
the united nations and the united states do not accept the 
vietnaminstalled government of cambodia as legitimate instead 
recognizing the rebel coalition of the khmer rouge forces under 
former cambodian leader prince norodom sihanouk and the 
noncommunist forces of former cambodian premier son sann 
thach said that he was sure the cambodian people would not allow 
pol pot and the khmer rouge to rule again 
if there was world condemnation of the crimes of pol pot it 
would demoralize his followers he added

a group seeking to deliver 30 tons of food 
clothing and medical supplies to nicaragua camped at this border 
city thursday and plotted how to win reversal of a federal policy 
blocking the mission 
we are kind of holding our place here today waiting for the 
pressure to build said gerry condon an organizer of the 
veterans peace convoy to nicaragua we are hoping it wont be 
long because there are people here who want very bad to make this 
trip to nicaragua 
the convoy began from four different regions of the country on 
may 21 and arrived at laredo tuesday night planning to cross into 
mexico on wednesday morning but treasury department officials said 
the groups plans to leave the 37 trucks buses and cars hauling 
the cargo in nicaragua would violate a 1985 trade embargo 
ninetyfour convoy members have made a commercial campground in 
northern laredo their base since wednesday at the campground 
thursday afternoon members sought shade from temperatures over 100 
degrees and planned strategies 
the group got support thursday from about 50 people picketing 
the federal building in austin and from us rep albert 
bustamante dtexas who wrote treasury secretary james baker on 
thursday urging him to allow the convoy to cross the border for 
humanitarian reasons 
a treasury department spokesman in washington said thursday that 
the departments office of foreign assets control told convoy 
supporters last month that taking the vehicles into nicaragua would 
require a license and posting of bonds to assure their return to 
the united states within 30 days 
they were notified in late may what the law was and what the 
facts were on what can be exported to nicaragua said the 
treasury spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity i mean 
theres no surprise here 
condon said the convoys position is that the vehicles are 
needed to distribute the supplies and are a form of humanitarian 
aid allowed under the embargo

the pueblo depot activity here and the 
longhorn army ammunition plant near marshall texas are the 
preferred sites for destroying pershing missiles under the inf 
treaty the army announced thursday 
the army advised the governors of both states of its choices for 
handling deactivation of missiles under the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty ratified last month by the united states and 
the soviet union 
the army already has permission from the texas environmental 
regulatory agency to eliminate rocket motors at longhorn and could 
begin work in august 
colorado officials are awaiting results of a recent test 
elimination before deciding on the armys request for a permit to 
burn motors at pueblo according to pda spokeswoman mary wilson 
the army wants to dispose of rockets by static firing in which 
a nonrefillable rocket engine is strapped down and fired 
exhausting its fuel 
in addition the army plans to dismantle pershings and eliminate 
certain other components such as missile nose structures and some 
mobile directorlaunchers at pueblo by cutting them up or crushing 
them 
to comply with the inf treaty the united states must eliminate 
all of its shorterrange pershing 1as within 18 months and 
intermediate range pershing iis within three years all us 
pershing 1a missiles are in storage at pueblo 
pershing ii missiles would be shipped to pueblo from eslewhere 
in the united states and europe 
the destruction of the several hundred missiles involved must be 
opened to soviet observers under the terms of the treaty just as 
soviet elimination of its missiles must be open to us 
representatives 
work in texas could begin in august wilson said while the 
colorado work depends upon state environmental approval

leaders of an underground catholic church said 
thursday they were seeking help from a vatican official when he 
presents a message from pope john paul ii to soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
ivan gel a leader of the underground ukrainian catholic church 
said several bishops priests and laymen from the church went to 
moscow planning to meet cardinal agostino casaroli who arrived 
wednesday for a russian orthodox celebration of the 1000th 
anniversary of christianity in this land 
we will put the question to him about the restoration of the 
legal status of the ukrainian catholic church gel said 
casaroli is carrying a message from the pope to gorbachev but 
has not divulged the contents 
other members of the roman catholic delegation led by casaroli 
said some contact with the ukrainians was likely but they could 
not say whether there would be a meeting 
the ukrainian catholic church which has its roots in the 
western ukraine ceased to exist officially in 1946 when it 
officially was united with the orthodox church but gel who is 
from the western ukrainian city lvov said at least four to five 
million worshipers continue to attend the underground services 
gel who said he spent 18 years in labor camps and exile for his 
religious activities said the last of the churchs political 
prisoners was released in november 1987 
instead of arresting clergy and believers who are practicing 
their faith authorities now regularly levy fines of about 80 for 
unsanctioned religious services gel said adding that parishioners 
take up collections to pay the fines 
gel credited gorbachevs reforms with easing the problems of 
ukrainain catholics the democratization of society enables a 
greater satisfaction of our spiritual needs he said 
but the church has not been officially recognized the russian 
orthodox church is bitterly opposed to recognition of the ukrainian 
church claiming it was formed only as a result of a forced split 
in the orthodox church at the end of the 16th century 
the russian orthodox church ended its fourday millennium 
council thursday at a monastery in the city of zagorsk about 35 
miles northeast of moscow 
metropolitan filaret of kiev and galich said the council had 
approved construction of a home for old priests and others 
connected to the church in what could be a tentative step away 
from government controls on religious activity

the prosecution picked oliver l north to be 
the leadoff defendant in the first of four irancontra conspiracy 
trials but suggested trying him with former national security 
adviser john m poindexter 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh notified us district 
judge gerhard a gesell of his selection of north but also asked 
the judge to consider the alternative of empaneling two juries for 
one trial of the fired national security council aide and his 
former boss 
walsh who also proposed a joint twojury trial for arms dealers 
albert hakim and richard v secord said this procedure still would 
protect each defendants constitutional rights against the 
prejudicial use of immunized congressional testimony 
gesell ruled wednesday that four separate trials were necessary 
to allow one defendant say north to use the immunized 
congressional testimony of hakim or poindexter for example as 
evidence to defend the charges against him 
the judge ruled that because the independent counsel statute 
dealt with wrongdoing by highlevel government officials north and 
poindexter should be tried first he gave walsh until friday to 
designate the leadoff defendant 
north indicated he was unconcerned by being selected for the 
first trial or being tried separately from his codefendants 
i guess winston churchill probably said it best north told 
cbs news he said never give in never never never give in 
and whether i have to fight this thing out alone in the courtroom 
or with others we will fight it out to the end and in the end we 
will win 
in court papers walsh said his proposal for two dualjury 
trials would meet the courts interest in protecting the rights 
of the defendants while alleviating the enormous burdens on the 
government of trying each defendant sequentially 
in a twojury trial one panel would hear the evidence against 
one defendant and the other would consider the case against the 
second defendant one of the juries would leave the courtroom 
before a defendant introduced evidence prejudicial to the other 
such as immunized congressional testimony 
walsh cited seven previous multijury federal court trials in 
which the procedure was upheld on appeal 
these included a 1982 dualjury bribery trial of two district of 
columbia officials us district judge charles richey empaneled 
two juries because one of the defendants had given a confession 
that was inadmissible against the other 
all the defendants except secord a retired air force major 
general were given limited grants of immunity from prosecution by 
congress to compel their testimony before the congressional 
irancontra hearings last year walsh cannot use the immunized 
testimony of a defendant against that individual 
but gesell has ruled that the defendants could use each others 
immunized testimony to help their defense 
in his filing thursday walsh said it would be logical to try 
poindexter and north together because they both are accused of 
using their positions of trust and power to facilitate and 
protect an illegal financial and logistical network to help the 
nicaraguan rebels by privately raising money and diverting profits 
from the usiran arms sales 
north a retired marine lieutenantcolonel and poindexter a 
retired navy rear admiral are accused of numerous acts of 
obstruction of justice and false statements intended to cover up 
the activities of the enterprise walsh said 
similarly hakim and secord former business partners who 
brokered the arms deals through a series of foreign companies and 
secret swiss bank accounts are both charged with conspiracy to pay 
illegal gratuities to north by setting up a 200000 trust fund for 
his family walsh said 
all four defendants are charged with conspiracy to defraud the 
government theft of government property and wire fraud 
the evidence the government would offer at separate trials of 
north and poindexter and of secord and hakim would be 
overlapping walsh said but two dualjury trials offers clear 
advantages in terms of judicial efficiency conservation of the 
governments resources and speedy adjudication of the cases 
four separate and sequential trials will result in at least 
some of the defendants living under the cloud of an indictment for 
several months walsh said 
the government will be forced to incur the substantial expense 
of trying four cases involving substantially similar proof and 
witnesses including the costs of maintaining the office of 
independent council and an elaborately guarded security facility 
built at government expense for the defense lawyers to examine 
reams of classified documents collected during the investigation 
walshs request for two trials instead f four appeared to be 
intended to lessen some of the tactical disadvantages that legal 
experts said he would face if forced to try the four defendants 
separately 
former us attorney joseph digenova said gesells ruling on 
wednesday presented walsh with his worstcase scenario he and 
other former prosecutors say getting conspiracy convictions is 
difficult when only one alleged conspirator is in the courtroom 
four separate trials also would force walsh to disclose evidence 
he intends to use against the other defendants long before they 
must stand trial walsh also would be forced to divide his staff 
into four separate trial teams because of the inevitable exposure 
to immunized congressional testimony 
legal experts said they viewed the north case as the logical 
place to start prosecuting because of the breadth of charges 
against him the indictment contains 16 counts against north 
compared with seven naming poindexter 
among the additional charges north is accused of obstructing 
the fbi investigation of the installation of a 15000 security 
fence around his suburban virginia house and for accepting payment 
for it from secord he also is accused of pocketing 4300 of the 
90000 in travelers checks given to him by a contra leader to 
cover expenses 
he also is accused of conspiring with two conservative 
fundraisers to use a taxexempt foundation illegally to raise 
private donations for the nicaraguan rebels 
you pick north first because he is the top banana in terms of 
expansiveness of the evidence said digenova 
it gives you the chance if you are only to have one trial to 
get most of your evidence in and tell your story about the 
conspiracy he said referring to the possibility of presidential 
pardons that might avert subsequent trials

a presbyterian statement that would declare 
nuclear war immoral went before a church panel thursday after foes 
of the controversial paper sought a oneyear delay for the 
3millionmember denomination to discuss it 
the paper christian obedience in a nuclear age is the 
result of a fiveyear process in the presbyterian church usa 
and has drawn the most interest among issues before the churchs 
200th general assembly in st louis 
other issues include health care pornography aids religious 
freedom central america and concerns including the election next 
week of one of the top denominational staff officers 
the christian obedience papers recommendations include 
declarations that both nuclear war and the theory of nuclear 
deterrence are immoral 
it also discusses tax resisters saying the church should not 
adopt a policy of resistance but be willing to support its members 
who feel called upon to resist 
the paper also says the decision to go along with government 
policy should be as painstakingly taken as the decision to resist 
presbyterians for democracy and religious freedom a sanctioned 
group in the denomination say the paper encourages tax resistance 
and does not reflect the majority viewpoint of the nations largest 
presbyterian denomination 
the paper is a partisan document that gives short shrift to 
opposing views the rev paul scotchmer pdrf executive director 
told the assembly committee on peacemaking and international 
relations at a hearing wednesday 
pdrf president john boone a layman from tennessee said if the 
paper is as solid as its supporters believe it can stand the 
test of one year 
also opposing the paper is the presbyterian council for 
chaplains and military personnel whose director charles e 
mcmillan told the committee the paper glorifies conscientious 
objection while denigrating military service 
the rev harry hassell of highland park presbyterian church in 
dallas the largest church in the denomination urged the committee 
to replace references to tax resistance with discussions on a 
christians responsibility to pay taxes while working within the 
system for change 
the committee of 58 clergy laity seminary and youth delegates 
split up into subcommittees later thursday with a 16member group 
assigned to deal with the christian obedience document 
that group chaired by the rev thomas j heger a campus 
minister from eugene ore can recommend revisions withdrawal or 
acceptance of the document 
it will report to the full committee saturday with the full 
assembly scheduled to take up the paper tuesday night the next to 
last day of the convention 
heger said he could not predict how his subcommittee might 
handle the report but in discussions thursday night the panel 
removed some language and changed other wording in the 5 pages of 
recommendations 
panel members felt some language placed resistance to government 
policy on the same level as cooperation and changed language which 
they felt could be interpreted as routinely offering financial 
support to government resisters 
other recommendations which have not been dealt with include 
suggestions the church offer legal aid for conscientious objectors 
and financial aid for their families 
a separate recommendation is the creation of a voluntary fund 
for obedience to higher authority for those who suffer financial 
loss or difficulty as a result of acts of conscience

patient trials are beginning on a 
vaccine to prevent recurrence of melanoma a hardtotreat skin 
cancer that strikes about 27000 americans eash year the vaccines 
developer said thursday 
what it means is there is potential for some hope and perhaps 
were going to be able to immunize a patient against potential 
recurrence said marc wallack a cancer specialist and chairman 
of general surgery at mount sinai medical center 
he is coordinating a threeyear study on at least 200 patients 
around the nation who have had melanomas surgically removed but are 
at high risk of the cancer returning spreading and killing them 
the trials are under way at the university of florida duke 
university in durham nc md anderson cancer institute in 
houston the university of alabama and emory university in 
atlanta he said 
cancer vaccines arent a new idea and vaccines for various 
cancers are being studied around the nation they aim to prevent 
cancers from returning by waking up the bodys immune system so 
it will seek out and destroy cancer cells that may have broken off 
a tumor and migrated thus escaping surgical removal 
dr philip livingston of sloankettering cancer center in new 
york is working on a different type of vaccine for melanoma which 
resists traditional chemical and radiation therapies 
im not saying one is better than the other but its a 
different approach said livingston whose work uses purified 
chemicals taken from cancer cells while wallacks uses cancercell 
membranes mixed with smallpox vaccine virus 
in wallacks vaccinia melanoma oncolysates vaccine four 
types of melanoma cells are infected with smallpox vaccine viruses 
membranes from infected cells are injected into patients weekly for 
13 weeks and then biweekly for the remainder of one year 
smallpox energizes the immune system alerting it to the cancer he 
believes 
the study is doubleblind meaning neither doctors nor patients 
know who is getting vaccine and who is injected with a placebo 
during followups wallack will compare the cancer recurrence and 
survival rates of the two groups of patients 
researchers wonder if extracts from the four melanoma cells used 
in wallacks study will trigger immune systems for the dozens of 
types of melanoma livingston said 
its a little bit of a shot in the dark in that regard he 
said 
wallack said the four cell types hes using should prove 
effective on all melanomas and if his preliminary test results are 
repeated the vaccine will help at least 15 percent of the 
patients he said 
skin cancers are diagnosed in about 500000 americans each year 
and are readily cured by surgical removal except for advanced 
melanoma recent american cancer society figures show of about 
7800 annual skin cancer deaths 5800 involved melanoma

a conference on eastwest security 
opened in potsdam thursday with strong attacks by western officials 
on what they called propagandistic disarmament proposals often 
put forward by the soviet bloc 
parliamentarian david owen leader of britains reformist social 
democratic party said he rejects east bloc proposals that all 
nuclear weapons be removed from europe he called such ideas 
naive nonsense and sheer propaganda 
if the soviets retain their weapons and western europe does 
not the nuclear threat to the west only increases owen said 
jack matlock the us ambassador in moscow also accused the 
soviets of making proposals with propagandistic intentions 
from time to time we face proposals that smack of this 
matlock said without going into specifics 
owen also took issue with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
contention at the latest ussoviet summit that the west has no 
right to try to dictate kremlin human rights policies 
respect for human rights under internationally agreed norms is 
certainly an important area he said 
oskar fischer east germanys foreign minister sided with 
gorbachev on the human rights issue in opening the threeday 
conference in this east german city southwest of berlin the 
conference is being sponsored by the institute for eastwest 
security studies in new york city 
fischer said the meaning of all human rights is turned upside 
down if the attempt is made to make ones own system of society 
and ones own values the measure of all things and to judge other 
states by these standards or even impose ones views on them 
he added while we do not force our convictions upon anybody 
else we expect others to do likewise 
fischer also renewed his calls for a nuclearfree corridor about 
150 kilometers 93 miles wide along the borders between nato and 
warsaw pact nations 
fischer said the warsaw pact is ready for the most radical 
reductions in the conventional field 
but he did not say if the soviet bloc is willing to concede to 
the kind of asymmetrical reductions demanded by the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
fischer also urged both sides to work closer in the economic 
sphere saying 
the arms race is putting an almost unbearable burden on the 
economies of both east and west engaging in competitive armament 
while trying to resolve global problems exceeds the economic 
capacities of all our countries 
others scheduled to address the conference include us commerce 
secretary william verity west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher and john whitehead us deputy secretary

lagging far behind democratic declarations 
the troop reduction talks are supposed to be held in vienna 
between the north atlantic treaty organization and the sevennation 
warsaw pact the idea is to ease tensions from the atlantic to the 
ural mountains after a 15year impasse over reducing nonnuclear 
forces in central europe 
summarizing the western allies stance at natos spring meeting 
in the spanish capital a senior us official said the decision 
was that we ought to wait and see what the soviets do in the area 
of human rights first 
the official who held a briefing under condition of anonymity 
said there was solid agreement on the position among the allies 
and that secretary of state george p shultz did not have to take 
the lead in persuading the other nato foreign ministers to go along 
president reagan during his summit trip to moscow stressed 
failure in soviet bureaucracy rather than soviet policy itself for 
the deficiencies in the human rights situation 
but shultz and his senior advisers are also disappointed that 
the reforms promised by foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in 
a presummit meeting with shultz last month in geneva had not been 
adopted or found their way to the negotiating table in vienna 
also the soviets have not agreed to permit monitors to report 
on their compliance with human rights accords and 20 monitors who 
were policing the 1975 helsinki agreement are still in jail the 
official said 
the united states also is pressing the soviets to release 
prisoners jailed for their religious beliefs and wants the right of 
appeal granted to soviet citizens who are refused exit permits

nothing is quite what it should be in the world 
created by director ingmar bergman for his startling violent and 
often mesmerizing production of hamlet which arrived this week 
at the brooklyn academy of music for an eightperformance run 
in bergmans unnerving creation for the royal dramatic theater 
of sweden denmark becomes an environment of decay sexual excess 
psychotic behavior and ultimately needless slaughter carried out to 
earbursting pop music and the whir of minicams and tape recorders 
elsinore has been transformed into a castle of lost souls where 
a drunken king and queen have sex in public while the court titters 
and applauds polonius preaches like a stuffy british barrister 
ophelia becomes a disheveled flower child gone mad the gravedigger 
turns into an existential comic waiting for godot and fortinbras 
storms the stage as a blackbereted guerrilla leader 
at the center of bergmans chaos stands a tall dark brooding 
hamlet who would not look out of place in one of new yorks tonier 
rock clubs dressed entirely in black and wearing sunglasses the 
actor slouches on stage as played by a fascinating and forceful 
actor named peter stormare this hamlet arrives with a marlon 
brando swagger and a norman bates psychosis 
stormare an intense hawklike presence brings a wild energy 
to the 3hour production the actor is not an introspective hamlet 
calmly reasoning out what should be done this prince rails against 
the world and what has happened to the kingdom since his uncle 
murdered his father and married his mother 
when this hamlet acts he gets carried away when he kills 
polonius he stabs him in the eye and then scrawls the word blood 
on the wall when he tells ophelia to get thee to a nunnery he 
nearly rapes her in the process 
there is one radical change in the text involving the transfer 
of one famous speech from one scene to another when hamlet is 
talking quietly to the player king about how to act out his 
fathers death the young prince overcome with grief suddenly 
breaks down and delivers to be or not to be its an 
interesting concept particularly since the actor portraying the 
player king per myrberg also plays the ghost of hamlets father 
bergmans production contains some startling imagery much of it 
designed by goran wassberg his setting is simple a bare black 
stage an arc of lights hanging above it and a circle outlined in 
red placed on the floor at center stage 
wassbergs costumes are equally eyecatching many of them in 
shades of red and from different periods of fashion the contrast 
between the old and new underlines the uncertainty that plagues 
this royal court 
pernilla ostergren is a touching ophelia a childwoman who 
remains on stage for much of evening a forlorn witness to most of 
the debauchery borje ahlstedt is a randy boozy claudius while 
gunnel lindblom as gertrude matches him in every debauchery rarely 
have these two royal misfits been so ably put on stage 
the production is performed in swedish and the language 
difference eventually poses a problem for audiences familiar with 
the english text bergmans interpretation of the story should be 
readily accessible but others with no knowledge of the play will 
be lost whats also missing from the production at least for an 
englishspeaking audience is the readily recognizable poetry 
still there are bergmans startling images of a world gone out 
of control the foreign language may cloud the text but the 
directors particular point of view shines through with a clarity 
that makes this hamlet a compelling and often haunting evening 
of theater

the government on thursday 
suggested it might order representatives of the british 
broadcasting corp to leave the country after the bbc aired a film 
on children detained without charge in south africa 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said a bbc spokesman phoned 
his office wednesday asking for comment on allegations in the film 
about torture of children during interrogation by police 
vlok said that when his spokesman leon mellet asked why the 
comment had not been sought beforehand the interviewer said 
quite frankly the bbc does not believe the south african 
government 
vlok said if this is the bbcs attitude then why should the 
south african government continue to host their representatives in 
our country 
vlok made his comments at a briefing to the presidents council 
an advisory body to president pw botha 
the south african government had appealed to the bbc for a 
chance to view the film suffer the children before it was 
broadcast wednesday night the bbc refused 
the governmentrun south african broadcasting corp reported 
thursday evening there is a question mark over future bbc 
representation in south africa after the televising of a program 
last night in which allegations were made about mistreatment of 
minor children in detention in the country 
a spokesman for the bbc in london who refused to be identified 
in accordance with british custom said naturally the bbc 
regrets any action which would impede our coverage from south 
africa 
the bbc said it commissioned the report from an independent 
londonbased company penumbra which filmed inside south africa 
without government permission and without seeking police comment 
because of emergency restrictions on the news media 
vlok also lashed out at members of the detainees parents support 
committee whose monthly reports on the numbers of people held 
under emergency detention were widely quoted by local and foreign 
news organizations as a reliable monitor during the past two years 
of the national emergency 
my warning to these people is stop it or your wings will be 
clipped vlok said he did not elaborate 
the government has refused even in parliament to give detailed 
information about the numbers of people held in detention but has 
frequently challenged the support committee to prove its figures 
based on interviews with families of missing people throughout the 
country 
in february the support committee was one of 17 organizations 
the government banned from all activity members of the group 
however continued to make statements as individuals and one of 
them max coleman has been engaged in a public debate with vlok 
for the past week about whether or not children under 16 remain in 
detention 
vlok says 80 minors none of them under 16 are now in detention 
he accused the members of the support group of trying to 
destroy the morale image and functions of the south african 
security forces through its slanted biased allegations and lies

a british cricket player was fired thursday as 
captain of englands international team because he invited a women 
to his hotel room officials said 
michael gatting 31 and married with two children behaved 
irresponsibly during a test international match by inviting 
female company to his room for a drink in the late evening said 
a statement by the test and county cricket board the games 
governing body 
he remains as a batsman on the team 
the board summoned gatting to a hearing following allegations 
wednesday in the sun that two of his players had sex with two women 
on the lawn outside their hotel in trent bridge near nottingham 
the night before mondays play and that gatting himself reportedly 
took a woman to his room for sex 
the masscirculation sun and other newspapers identified the 
woman as a 20yearold barmaid and attributed the allegation about 
gatting to her 
the incident was said to have happened after play during a 
fiveday match against the west indies that ended in a draw tuesday 
gatting denied allegations of sexual misconduct and vowed to sue 
the newspapers the cricket boards statement said 
in any event the invitation to mike gatting to captain the 
england team has been withdrawn the board said using the 
polite language that still prevails in the world of cricket 
the second of the five matches against the west indies begins 
june 16 at lords the london ground regarded as the mecca of 
cricket 
and it was to lords that the england team selectors summoned 
gatting on thursday 
allegations involving gatting also appeared in the sun today 
and daily mirror 
the selectors emphasized that they did not believe the 
allegations in the newspapers and accepted gattings account of 
what happened the statement said 
however it added that team manager micky stewart was still 
looking into the allegations and a substitute captain would be 
named friday after stewart reported to the selectors 
gatting who refused to speak to reporters as he left stepped 
down from the team for the lords match according to the statement 
warnings had previously been issued to all england players 
concerning the standard of behavior expected of them at all times 
both on and off the field and these had been ignored it said 
gatting has played for england 59 times and has captained the 
team since june 1986 
but although gatting was decorated by queen elizabeth ii for his 
cricketing prowess his captaincy has been lackluster he won only 
two of his 23 internationals as captain and last year he was 
officially censured for having a foulmouthed shouting match with a 
pakistani umpire during an international in faisalabad

75567847 is quite comfortable at 
harvard university 
for nearly six centuries the wool doll fashioned in the form of 
a weaver rested in a cool and dry chanchay indian crypt on the 
central coast of peru it now bears a catalog number and sits on a 
metal shelf in the climate controlled attic of the peabody museum 
of archaeology and ethnology 
although the 2 million or so artifacts that fill the peabodys 
back rooms are rarely viewed by the public museum curators from 
around the world have become fascinated by the transformation of 
the storage areas from musty chaos to a stateoftheart sanctuary 
this is the way it used to be said assistant ethnology 
collections manager kathy skelly gesturing toward a rack of boxes 
containing an unrelated assortment of relics it was a mess 
the boxes however are the final link with the peabodys 
cluttered past 
a nearly completed 10year project to renovate and modernize the 
museums storage areas has led to precise and innovative 
preservation tactics 
large artifacts are kept in rooms where temperature and humidity 
are tailored to protect various materials small items are encased 
in acidfree mounts which allow researchers to view but not touch 
objects the tile floors are spotless motion alarms and sprinklers 
hang from the ceilings 
people have the impression that the back rooms of museums look 
like their attics at home said collections manager una 
macdowell that was somewhat true in the past but i think what 
you see at the peabody will be the trend in the future 
in midoctober about 30 curators and executives with the new 
england museum association toured the peabodys storage facilities 
curators from around the world regularly inquire about its 
preservation efforts macdowell added 
i tell them the key in funding she said 
a lot of developing countries are interested in trying to 
improve the way they store artifacts they see as an important part 
of their national heritage said macdowell its just not 
possible if you do not commit the funding 
the approximate 25 million upgrading of the peabodys storage 
rooms funded by harvard and the national science foundation is 
one of the most comprehensive efforts at artifact preservation 
said assistant director rosemary joyce 
joyce said similar programs have been sponsored at the 
smithsonian institute in washington and the bernice bishop museum 
in honolulu 
in a building older than some of the objects it houses the 
problems of preservation were compounded at the peabody macdowell 
said 
in the summer the attic was stifling objects stored in the 
basement levels were plunged into a chill throughout the winter 
she added 
we finally achieved a stable environment for our collection 
and that is very important said macdowell 
put it this way said assistant archaeology collections 
manager susan bruce were happy and the artifacts are happy 
bruce led a team of experts which examined the peabodys 
collection of nearly 1000 precolumbian andean textiles the 
textiles once stacked like the wares of a rug merchant are now 
layered between specially treated paper 
very few museums have anything close to this she said 
its something that the public doesnt see but its a vital part 
of what a museum should be about 
in a nearby room with a climate modified for wood and leather 
objects skelly walked up an aisle studying the collection 
she passed plains indian feather headdresses and clubs from 
south pacific islands across the aisle dozens of 85yearold 
chinese figurines were arranged to depict a funeral procession 
and here is one of our treasures said skelly stopping at a 
carved wood stool beaten by new guinea tribal leaders during 
important decrees 
macdowell later banged on a metal table top 
were finally moving into the 20th century she said its 
exciting

this time last year the odds that abcs 
2020 would celebrate its 10th anniversary as it does tonight 
with a twohour retrospective seemed about 5050 
when abc entertainment president brandon stoddard announced he 
was moving 2020 from its longtime thursday time period to 
friday many people including 2020 cohost hugh downs 
complained loudly 
i finally called abc president john sias a few weeks after 
we went on and i said i feel apologetic about all the public 
moaning i was doing about the dumb move to friday downs said 
in a telephone interview from los angeles where he was attending 
the network affiliates meeting 
im very pleased that it came out all right but it may be 
that im not off base to think its a tribute to the strength of 
the show to virtually break tradition people dont usually cross 
calendar lines to follow a show that they like and by george 
people did 
2020 held its own in the ratings finishing the season a 
respectable 49th out of 85 regularly scheduled programs 
downs who recently celebrated 40 years in the business and 
cohost barbara walters are no doubt a big reason for the shows 
following a proven team they were paired years ago as cohosts on 
nbcs today show 
a major major major reason for the success of 2020 is 
hugh and barbara said executive producer victor neufeld i 
think they have developed over the years one of the bestliked and 
wellrespected hosting teams in television the chemistry is 
perfect 
heres barbara the highpowered major worldwide broadcasting 
entityslashinterviewer sitting next to hugh downs a gentleman 
an easygoing respected but wellliked individual who is perfect 
counter 
other correspondents have included silvia chase and geraldo 
rivera who are no longer with the show tom jarriel bob brown 
john stossel lynn sherr and stone phillips all are featured in 
the retrospective 
we work very hard at the concept of being close to our 
viewers said neufeld we do pieces that reflect what we think 
is of interest around the country we are not into ourselves 
and do stories we think we want to do 
although at the time stoddard said he was confident the 
2020 audience would follow it to fridays he did assure 
concerned television critics and viewers that the program would get 
a new time rather than be canceled if its ratings dropped 
now says downs with a laugh im content if they leave it on 
friday i wouldnt want to move back to thursday in other words

cronkite at large walter cronkite who hopes to carve out some 
additional air time in his contract renegotiations with cbs gets 
his first primetime exposure of 1988 on saturday with walter 
cronkite at large 
cronkite in a recent interview declined to comment on the 
negotiations only to say i think both sides are hopeful we can 
come to a happy relationship again to continue the 38 years of my 
association with the company i cant characterize the negotiations 
at the moment open and continuing 
cronkite the longtime anchor of the cbs evening news 
stepped down in 1981 and was succeeded by dan rather since then he 
has been a special correspondent anchoring irregularly scheduled 
specials 
under cronkites contract negotiated in 1980 his annual salary 
drops from approximately 1 million to 150000 when he turns 72 in 
november and he becomes a consultant rather than correspondent 
after cronkite suggested publicly that he would be free to work on 
other networks cbs began negotiating to keep the symbol of cbs 
news at cbs 
cronkite said he wouldnt mind continuing to do the at large 
series which allows him to travel widely doing stories of personal 
interest 
saturdays edition features an update on the predictions of 20 
years ago that the environment would be ruined by now without 
protection a report on macau a gambling center that will become 
in a few years the property of distinctly antigambling communist 
china and a travelogue on hotair ballooning in france 
its kind of an ideal program to do whether thats the exact 
format of future programming i might do i just dont know 
cronkite said i think thats something for us to examine when we 
kind of come to a decision what our relationship is

bertha shefton closed her eyes and 
shuddered as she relived the moment 
the 80yearold widow owed 10344 on her water bill and city 
utility truck no 986 had just arrived at her small white stucco 
bungalow to cut off the water 
doing without water would be hard enough for a frail old woman 
in the suffocating subtropical heat and humidity of south florida 
but mrs shefton also cares for a granddaughter who has lost her 
left leg to diabetes and must undergo kidney dialysis three times a 
week 
i tried to explain that somebody had stolen my social security 
check and that id pay the bill as soon as my next check came in 
mrs shefton told a visiting reporter they told me they were 
only doing their job 
it was plain to see those boys didnt want to do it they said 
they were real sorry but it was still awful to watch them drive 
away and know our water had been cut off 
but what the crew did next has made the four men local heroes 
and brought in donations that should make mrs shefton secure for a 
long time they drove back turned the water on and scraped up 
enough cash to pay her bill 
when the word got out about what happened a local plumbing 
contractor volunteered to pay mrs sheftons water bill for a year 
another local company is paying her electric bills said benny 
scott who supervises city water department crews 
scott and the three members of the citys celebrated utility 
crew joe johnson mark craddock and lyn roberts visited mrs 
shefton one recent steamy afternoon they stopped by to say hello 
and see how she was faring 
these are my friends mrs shefton said giving scott a hug 
these fellows are my heroes theyre the ones who started the 
wheels turning for me 
the wheels began turning mrs sheftons way almost immediately 
after the utility truck pulled away from the curb in front of her 
house on april 14 
we decided we just couldnt leave her like that johnson 
said it was the middle of the month and that meant it would be 
more than two weeks before the old ladys next check would arrive 
it was plain that she and her granddaughter really needed help 
cutting off water service in such a climate makes people 
desperate the crew members said 
some of them get real nasty and threaten to shoot you or sic 
their dogs on you said roberts others get down and beg you 
not to do it which only makes it worse 
mrs shefton had merely asked for enough time to fill her 
bathtub and a few pots and pans with water before service was shut 
off 
it really touched me johnson said 
so the crew members called their office on the truck radio and 
found out how much mrs shefton owed then they began pulling money 
out of their pockets 
joe and i each put up 15 and willie hargrett our foreman 
pitched in 20 roberts said some other fellows at the office 
also contributed a few dollars and benny scott put up the 
remaining 3344 
craddock put in a dollar 
but that was every penny he had said roberts it was a 
gift from his heart 
news media soon picked up the story 
since then weve gotten dozens of calls and letters from all 
over the place scott said people from as far away as 
california have sent money and checks for mrs shefton a local guy 
even stopped by and gave us a check for the 10344 we had put up 
scott said he has turned over all the contributions including 
the 10344 check to mrs sheftons church where a fund has been 
set up for her 
so far weve received more than 700 the rev otis sample 
pastor of the mt calvary baptist church said recently well 
use the money to help her pay her bills 
mrs shefton lost her husband izell a year ago and she and 
her granddaughter mercideen pugh 37 live on a monthly income of 
952 
mrs shefton a former domestic worker who cleaned the homes of 
pompano beachs more affluent families for 40 years said she 
doesnt know what to make of all the help and support she has 
received 
its wonderful but dont forget that it all started with 
these boys here she said pointing to johnson roberts craddock 
and scott 
we were happy to do it replied scott who said he too is 
somewhat flabbergasted by all the attention including letters of 
commendation from the mayor 
we didnt have no idea it would turn out like this he said 
we were just trying to help a nice old lady out of a jam

journalism groups say gunmen and 
assassins have killed 25 mexican journalists in the past six years 
in what may be a concerted effort to intimidate reporters 
investigating drug trafficking or critical of political figures 
the groups consisting of journalists unions newspaper 
publishers and writers are demanding the government of president 
miguel de la madrid take more forceful action to stop those trying 
to censor them not by official blue pencil but by the gun 
the number of killings are said to have risen along with an 
increase of drug trafficking through mexico in the 12 years 
previous to 1982 18 journalists were killed compared with the 25 
listed by the journalism groups as having been killed in the past 
six years 
de la madrid responded to the journalists complaints june 7 
mexicos freedom of the press day that his government is 
determined to find out the killers and bring them to justice 
his interior department in mexico city however disputes the 
journalists claim that 25 colleagues have been killed it said in 
a report it investigated 24 cases a 25th is in the hands of the 
attorney general and found 15 professional journalists were slain 
and that four others had marginal incidental or occasional 
employment in the field the remaining five it said were had no 
connection with the profession 
the journalism groups however hold to their list of 25 
alejandro junco publisher of the newspaper el norte in the 
northern city of monterrey said the reports conclusions are 
overly optimistic theyre trying to prove a point and theres 
some truth to what they say but not all truth 
but i would rather be overly concerned than have a false sense 
of security 
junco also is president of the mexican press freedom committee 
of the interamerican press association 
the most recent journalist homicide was the shooting april 20 in 
this northwestern border city of hector felix miranda columnist 
and codirector of the outspoken weekly zeta who often wrote about 
politics 
an automobile overtook felix miranda known as felix the 
cat as he drove to his office that morning a man stepped out of 
the car and fired three shots from a 12gauge shotgun 
the federal judicial police arrested victoriano medina on may 1 
and charged him with murder but they said he may have been acting 
for others 
many of the columnists colleagues question whether any others 
who may be responsible ever will be brought to justice 
among the allegations circulating are that highranking 
politicians who were satirized or criticized in felix mirandas 
columns might have been involved 
we dont dismiss that possibility said jesus blancornelas 
the codirector with felix miranda of the tijuana weekly 
rosario ibarra de piedra a humanrights activist and 
presidential candidate for the small revolutionary workers party 
recently voiced concern about what she called the alarming rate at 
which journalists have been threatened suppressed and 
assassinated 
we must protest for the journalists who have been silenced 
she told reporters at a news conference you form part of the 
consciousness of the people of mexico 
freedom house a new yorkbased human rights monitoring group 
said in its latest freedom in the world report that the mexican 
press operated under constant threat of intimidation 
of at least 19 journalists killed throughout the world in 1986 
in freedom houses reports four were from mexico more than from 
any other country 
the problem is worse in mexico than any other latin american 
country said junco the monterrey publisher who also is 
president of the mexican press freedom committee of the 
interamerican press association 
this is very alarming because the rate of increase in 
journalist murders is phenomenal he added in an interview 
the interior department report said available evidence indicates 
that of the 15 professionals killed seven of the cases lead to the 
presumptions that the deaths are not tied to journalistic work 
it added that three were journalists whose death is presumably 
linked with drug trafficking and five were killed for reasons 
presumably linked to journalistic activity 
junco challenged the departments claim that three journalists 
were involved in drugtrafficking 
i just dont buy the argument that people were involved with 
drugs and thats why they were killed he said 
maybe some were moonlighters or parttimers but they were not 
killed because of their other jobs

said fernando pineda president of the liberal union of 
democratic journalists the problem is that there are 25 dead 
journalists one never knows the motivation even if they were 
killed for other reasons the investigations and clarifications 
should be concluded 
we dont know if they were killed for some story they wrote or 
for some other situation 
but he added that any unsolved cases leads to a general climate 
of insecurity that makes journalism in mexico a very high risk 
profession 
junco said he believes reportage on the increase in illegal drug 
trafficking from the florida area to the southwestern united states 
via mexico and the subsequent criticism in the mexican media of 
drug trafficking is partly the reason for the increase in 
killings he is not alone in that belief 
elena poniatowska one of mexicos more prominent writers said 
that the journalists deaths in northern mexico in particular 
generally appear to be related to the drug trades rise 
speaking at a conference on cultural conflict and literature 
she said she was not accusing the government of the deaths but 
the omission becomes complicity by not punishing the guilty 
the government has offered rewards for information about the 
killings of several journalists including that of the influential 
columnist manuel buendia of excelsior a major newspaper in mexico 
city 
he was shot to death may 30 1984 in mexico citys zona rosa 
pink zone business and entertainment district 
buendia whose column private network appeared on 
excelsiors front page was regarded as a hardhitting 
investigative reporter who covered a wide range of subjects 
including politics and international affairs he was the author of 
the book the cia in mexico and wrote often of his opposition to 
us involvement in central america 
the federal investigator assigned to the case issued a report on 
the fourth anniversary of the slaying saying authorities had 
whittled down the number of possible intellectual authors 
people who could be behind the killing to 41 and of those 
suspected of actually carrying it out to 10 
he concluded that the chance for a resolution of the case is 
only modest 
the federal attorney generals office under pressure from 
reporters and civic groups recently offered a reward of 500 
million pesos close to 215000 for information leading to the 
arrest of those responsible for buendias killing 
another victim was manuel burgueno orduno who wrote frequently 
about drug trafficking in the northwestern coastal state of 
sinaloa he was shot and killed in his home there feb 22 by three 
men who entered his house as he and his family mourned the death of

at the end she was alone hiding from the 
world shed shattered that day in wild gunfire outside the tears 
and trauma had just begun inside laurie dann shot one last time 
and her torment was over 
no one saw her place the 32caliber revolver in her mouth or 
heard the shot that destroyed her demons and ended a day of terror 
three weeks after she killed a young boy at hubbard woods 
elementary school and ended her life in the house where she had 
held police at bay authorities are still trying to piece together 
the puzzle of laurie danns life 
we want to answer the question why said winnetka police lt 
joseph sumner what made it happen how did it happen we owe 
that to the citizens and the community we owe it to the families 
of victims if you put yourself in their spot youd want to know 
why 
its very possible she may have taken that to the grave with 
her he added we can hopefully come down with a position of 
this is probably why 
laurie danns road to tragedy was lined with signs of trouble 
ahead most posted in the last two years 
in that time she was divorced forced out of an apartment and 
charged with shoplifting she lied about her name age and 
occupation she claimed to be a teacher or a journalism student 
she was suspected of making hundreds of harassing hangup or 
threatening phone calls to her exhusband his family and others 
she was charged once but the case was dropped due to insufficient 
evidence 
students and officials at two schools say she hid raw meat under 
seat cushions wore knit gloves when she ate ran her shower for 
hours and rode an elevator day and night in her dormitory where she 
was called psycho and elevator lady 
she was definitely a very very confused woman sumner said 
dangerous too her exhusband and others feared but even as 
they were contacting the fbi prosecutors and police several north 
shore families were unwittingly hiring dann as a babysitter 
two days before the may 20 tragedy arizona prosecutors were 
ready to charge dann with making threatening phone calls to a 
former boyfriend illinois authorities were working a similar case 
the fbi was closing in too 
they moved too late by then dann had killed 8yearold 
nicholas corwin she shot five other children at the school and a 
20yearold man who tried to disarm her when she burst into his 
familys house she barricaded herself there and committed suicide 
i dont see why this had to happen and get this far susan 
taylor her former sisterin law said on abcs nightline 
taylor said dann called her hundreds of timessaying things like 
susie susie susie you are going to die 
dann police say left behind a trail of poison 31 packets of 
juice and other foods 29 of them contaminated with arsenic or 
lead sent to her exhusband psychiatrist families she worked 
for two northwestern university fraternity houses and others 
police believe she may once have known someone at the frat 
houses but dont know why she directed her poison at acquaintances 
her gun at strangers 
it wasnt the only paradox in danns life 
children she tended adored her but adults came to fear her 
she was raised in a world of wealth and elegant homes but she 
left rotting meat behind in one apartment with urinestained floors 
still some say they detected no hint of growing fury 
she really was a pleasant quiet person she wasnt 
this ghoulish person all her life said peter solber one 
attorney who represented her in divorce proceedings she wasnt 
the monster she turned out to be 
for most of her 30 years laurie dann lived an unremarkable life 
laurie wasserman who had an older brother mark graduated from 
prestigious new trier east high school her father a successful 
accountant and mother live in glencoe on the north shore where 
500000 mansions private beaches along lake michigan and 
threecar garages are not uncommon 
in high school she was really quiet kind of withdrawn she 
held her head low said exclassmate margie guiarelli there 
was always kind of a wall inbetween she never really gave you 
eye contact she was nervous when she talked to you 
she took classes at four universities drake arizona 
northwestern and wisconsinmadison over six years at arizona 
she majored in home economics but did not graduate after four 
years later she took courses in acting dance and playwriting 
at arizona dann pledged alpha delta pi sorority where sisters 
remembered her as introverted and recalled how she would make 
several dates for one night then cancel all but one 
i just perceived her to be a sweet little girl denise 
shimer janes a former chapter president told the arizona star 
for two years dann dated a premed student at arizona who later 
claimed she harassed him with threatening phone calls his identity 
has not been made public 
however the mans friend louis spivack an arizona prosecutor 
who doubledated with them remembers dann as aloof perhaps a 
little unfriendly possessive but exhibiting no especially 
strange behavior 
in 1982 two years after returning to the chicago area she 
married russell dann who worked in his familys insurance firm 
solber said his client who was 5foot3 described herself and 
her husband as both little and cute she said they looked like 
brother and sister that was her perception 
the danns bought a 275000 home but the marriage crumbled by 
1986 she saw a psychiatrist for part of their marriage 
their parting was bitter dann who had taken a marksmanship 
course in her college days bought a 357caliber magnum saying 
she needed it for protection a worried russell dann alerted 
police who contacted her parents wasserman told officers the gun 
would be locked in a safety deposit box 
the 357 was one of three guns she carried into the school 
dann also accused her husband of assault breaking into their 
home and setting it on fire charges never substantiated 
russell dann in turn asserted she sneaked into his apartment 
as he slept sept 30 1986 and stabbed him in the chest with an 
ice pick he said he never saw his assailant and later claimed his 
exwife had admitted to the attack 
but russell failed a lie detector test and refused to take a 
second while laurie passed said michael waller assistant lake 
county states attorney

police found packaging for an ice pick in the house the danns 
had shared but waller said no fingerprints were on the pick 
itself waller also said reports indicated the doctor and nurse who 
treated russell at the hospital noted the wound could have been 
selfinflicted 
no charges were filed there was just no case there waller 
said 
according to divorce records dann was to receive a lump sum of 
125000 and 1250 monthly for three years 
after the shootings russell dann appeared on nightline at 
his request and phoned a radio talk show to urge tougher gun 
control since then he has declined further comment 
he did acknowledge to the associated press however that some 
people think i was the bad guy 
laurie danns life began unraveling faster and faster in 1986 
that summer she dated john childs whose mother alexandra 
lived near her parents she was very pretty very preppy 
but very shy mrs childs said and had unusual habits she 
washed her hands often and touched things only with a napkin 
she said her son noticed too many problems shed be very 
friendly then it would be dont touch me dont touch me 
that fall spivack said his friend now a doctor began getting 
harassing calls he believed were from dann six years after their 
breakup 
spivack said dann somehow obtained the doctors unlisted number 
the fbi said she knew where the doctor was working spivack said 
the calls stopped in 1987 after an attorney wrote a letter to her 
parents home 
last summer danns father intervened when northwestern 
university officials reacting to repeated harassment complaints 
including reports she left raw meat under lounge cushions moved to 
evict her she left the graduate student apartment she was 
subletting 
dann then posted notices in local groceries seeking babysitting 
jobs many families said she had a terrific rapport with children 
but wasserman twice made restitution to employer families after his 
daughter was suspected of stealing food or clothes police say 
in january dann moved to the towers in madison wis a 
dormitory one block off the university of wisconsin campus most 
residents were freshmen more than a decade younger than dann 
her suitemate said dann told her she was a journalism student 
from northwestern but she never carried books or attended classes 
dann explained to dorm neighbors she wore gloves when she ate 
because she was allergic or sensitive to metal objects 
the suitemate who asked not to be identified said after 
several incidents she became uncomfortable and moved out 
other residents say dann avoided sidewalk cracks watched tv all 
day and rode the elevators for hours carrying a note pad student 
brian soifer said he heard she wept once when some guys teased her 
on the elevator 
everybody told stories about her he said she must have 
known people were pointing at her and talking about her 
she just looked like she was lost said resident scott 
tzinberg 
amid mounting harassment complaints meanwhile the 
investigations continued 
waller said december phone records showed that 55 predawn calls 
lasting a minute or less were made in 4 hours from the wasserman 
home 
in march dann reportedly stopped seeing her psychiatrist who 
had prescribed lithium carbonate to treat depression she was also 
taking an experimental drug called clomipramine used for 
obsessivecompulsive disorders 
that month a woman who had known the danns when they were 
married and had received hundreds of hangup calls since 1986 
picked up her phone to hear you are going to die the woman who 
asked that her name not be used suspected dann in all the calls 
on march 14 dann was arrested in madison accused of stealing 
four wigs and other items said capt jeff frye he said dann 
initially gave police a fake name and a michigan address once she 
gave her real name she still gave phony information on her student 
status and address he said 
on may 9 spivack said his friend answered the phone and heard a 
female voice say she would come out and stab them and make it 
look like his wife had done it the fbi was given a 
taperecording of the call 
the night of may 15 frye said dann was found in a dormitory 
trash room curled in a fetal position wrapped in a plastic bag and 
dripping with sweat 
when police arrived however she was asleep in her room aware 
of the arizona investigation the fbi was called they arrived the 
next morning she was gone 
after the shooting police searched her belongings and found a 
picture of her with her exhusband scraps of paper with names 
rough drafts of threatening notes to the arizona doctor supportive 
letters from her parents four catalog cards from a library 
referring to books on poisoning a list of words including 
schools and both and a white smock she apparently took 
from a hospital where shed been treated as an outpatient said fbi 
agent kent miller in madison 
miller said dann was suspected of stealing arsenic and other 
chemicals from a hospital lab in march 
plans in arizona to seek an indictment may 18 were delayed to 
coordinate legal action with other states 
two days later laurie dann wearing a university of arizona 
medical center shirt with a skeleton on it reached the end of her 
road to tragedy 
i feel very frustrated spivack said we were within a few 
days of averting this we ran out of time

seven years after its discovery aids 
is still spreading rapidly around the world and researchers still 
lack answers to some of the most perplexing questions about how the 
virus causes disease 
beginning sunday in stockholm 6500 researchers from 125 
countries will gather for the fourth international conference on 
aids the largest and most important of the hundreds of aids 
research meetings held every year 
the scientists are expected to make some 3000 presentations of 
fresh research on aids at the conference which concludes june 16 
i think whats going to be clear at this meeting is that all 
the earlier ideas about the magnitude of the problem and the 
potential dangers this poses to world health have been confirmed 
over the past year said william haseltine a molecular biologist 
at the danafarber cancer institute in boston 
the earlier projections have if anything been 
underestimated he said the notion of how the virus spreads 
has been confirmed 
its principal means of spreading remains through sexual contact 
hypodermic needles shared by drug abusers and unscreened transfused 
blood us blood is screened for the presence of the virus 
the sexual transmission of aids has been further clarified he 
said 
were beginning to understand the potential roots of sexual 
transmission as mediated not by blood to blood but by 
virusinfected cell to mucosal lining haseltine said that is 
cells carrying the virus often gain entry to an uninfected person 
through such mucosal linings as those in the vagina or the anus 
haseltine said 
at the time of the last international aids conference in 
washington in june 1987 reports on aids were appearing in 
scientific journals at the rate of about 100 per week 
that figure has climbed to 135 per week according to the 
institute for scientific information in philadelphia and the trend 
is continuing 
the explosion of research has brought scientists closer to 
understanding the life cycle and reproduction of the aids virus 
but unfortunately not dramatically closer to a vaccine or a cure 
researchers said 
i think the meeting will show substantial basic science and 
clinical progress said dr robert gallo of the national cancer 
institute one of the discoverers of the aids virus 
no breakthroughs are expected in the early trials of vaccines 
that are now underway gallo said in fact he said he thought the 
current vaccines generally consisting of a part of the aids 
viruss outer coat will not trigger the kind of immune response 
needed to prevent aids infection 
im not enthusiastic he said indeed the human trials 
should be considered only scientific experiments he said not 
trials of potentially useful substances the term vaccine should 
not be being used he said 
everybody now agrees that we face formidable problems with 
vaccines haseltine said its a sober realization 
this virus has evolved to evade our immune systems and it 
does so by hiding out by coating itself with sugar and by changing 
when necessary 
the vaccine trials have shown that people make antibodies to the 
virus when injected with a fragment of the virus but the 
antibodies dont protect the subjects the reason they dont is 
that the viruses have evolved to live with humans a long time 
said haseltine 
one recent study by a japanese group led by masanori hayami 
suggested that a progenitor of the aids virus might have infected 
the common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans at least 20 million 
years ago 
other studies suggest that the aids virus mutates very rapidly 
and might not have infected humans until perhaps 100 years ago 
on the treatment front dr martin hirsch of the massachusetts 
general hospital a leader in the evaluation of potential antiaids 
drugs said he foresees no dramatic advances 
weve learned an enormous amount about the molecular biology 
of the virus he said we know a lot less about how it causes 
disease in humans 
that has made research difficult nevertheless the development 
in the laboratory of potential antiaids drugs has moved very 
quickly hirsch said the progress in testing them has been more 
difficult because you have to do clinical trials evaluating each 
drug 
such clinical trials are becoming more difficult in part because 
aids sufferers are obtaining experimental drugs illegally through a 
network of guerrilla clinics that makes it difficult for doctors 
to be sure their subjects are free of drugs that might confound the 
results of their experiments 
i can understand the frustration but it does make things more 
difficult he said 
in an article published thursday in nature a british scientific 
journal dr jay levy of the university of california san 
francisco identified four important and unresolved questions 
surrounding aids 
what determines whether infection will occur 
how do different strains of the aids virus arise 
how does the virus cause disease 
and what determines the course of the infection 
concentration on these areas of research should provide 
valuable information to help in the attack against hiv the aids 
virus he wrote in the process we will learn a great deal 
more about viruses and the function of the immune system

takeover target macmillan inc and texas 
billionaire robert m bass will face off today in court where a 
judge will decide whether the publishing giant can proceed with a 
controversial restructuring plan 
macmillan rejected basss latest 19 billion buyout offer on 
wednesday saying its restructuring plan is more beneficial to 
shareholders 
at a hearing in delaware chancery court set for this afternoon 
bass attorneys will seek to halt a dividend payout which marks the 
first phase of the restructuring on grounds that macmillan 
directors have breached their fiduciary duties by failing to get 
the best price for shareholders 
macmillan attorney dennis block defended the plan as perfectly 
appropriate and providing substantial value to shareholders at 
this time and giving them continuing equity interest in the 
future of the company 
the restructuring plan would split the company into two publicly 
held entities and pay shareholders a special dividend of 5235 a 
share the dividend is scheduled to be paid friday and macmillan 
stressed it is proceeding on schedule 
the time limit is extremely tight and both sides likely would 
prefer the judge to rule from the bench 
robert dunlap jr an analyst with brown brothers harriman amp 
co said if macmillan manages to pay the dividend on friday it 
would appear management has won 
attorneys close to the deal say it is likely the bass request 
which has drawn support from the aggressive new york investment 
firm coniston partners will result in at least a temporary delay 
in the payout 
coniston which has accumulated a 49 percent stake in 
macmillan filed an affidavit in support of basss effort to block 
the dividend payout 
were interested in seeing a full auction for the company and 
having it sold to the highest bidder said coniston principal 
augustus oliver who pegged macmillans value at between 85 to 
100 a share 
he would not comment on whether the partnership might make its 
own bid for macmillan 
but one source close to the battle speculated that coniston is 
in it for the money they dont want to buy the company and 
that the partnerships affidavit was merely an attempt to ensure it 
gets fair value for its stock 
bass has offered to acquire the company for 73 a share in cash 
or alternatively to restructure it in a similar fashion but 
bass who owns about 91 percent of macmillans roughly 26 million 
outstanding shares offered to pay shareholders a dividend of 58 a 
share 
macmillan plans to separate into macmillan publishing co and 
macmillan information co in addition to the dividend shareholders 
would receive for each macmillan share a halfshare of common stock 
in macmillan information and 450 in principal amount of macmillan 
information subordinated debentures 
on wall street macmillan rose 62 cents a share to close at 76 
on the new york stock exchange wednesday 
coniston fresh from its recent unsuccessful proxy battle for 
four seats on the board of gillette co typically purchases a 
large stake in a company and then pressures management to 
restructure or take other action to boost its stock price 
macmillan has filed its own suit in federal district court for 
the southern district of new york charging bass and his affiliates 
with violating securities laws repeatedly filing and disseminating 
false information and engaging in a creeping tenders

the united states needs to build televisions 
not just computers in order to remain a hightech superpower into 
the 21st century some of the nations technology giants say 
international business machines corp apple computer inc 
hewlettpackard co american telephone amp telegraph co and others 
agreed this week that a strong consumer electronics industry is 
critical to a strong technology base 
the companies agreed tuesday to form a task force to study how 
us companies can catch up to the japanese in the next generation 
of televisions electronicscrammed models that will produce 
pictures nearly as sharp as magazine photos 
at stake is a market that will grow to 40 billion a year 
worldwide by the year 2010 as well as competence in a whole range 
of related technologies from speedy computer chips to advanced 
signal processing 
zenith electronics corp of glenview ill is the only 
usbased company still making televisions and it lost money on 
them last year 
the announcement of the task force on highdefinition television 
is an acknowledgment of the damage the united states has suffered 
by allowing its consumer electronics business to wither 
theyre finally learning what the japanese have known for 
years said william hassinger assistant bureau chief for 
engineering in the mass media bureau of the federal communications 
commission as the japanese have found out you can use consumer 
electronics as a sort of economic engine to pull a train that has a 
lot of other things in it 
the task force created at a meeting in santa clara calif of 
the american electronics association will be headed by alexander 
stark a senior vice president of atampt and richard elkus chairman 
of santa clarabased prometrix corp a maker of semiconductor 
production equipment 
the task force is supposed to size up the situation and report 
back in 30 days 
experts say consumer products ranging from compact disk players 
to videocassette recorders have become so advanced that in some 
respects they are more sophisticated than mainframe computers or 
nuclear missiles 
in fact japanese companies sell a large proportion of the 
components for american weaponry even though they never set out to 
create a military hardware industry it was a spinoff from their 
other product lines 
hassinger said the attempt to start up a television business 
would be complicated by such things as the need to set up 
dealerships distributors repair arrangements advertising and a 
base of customers 
as for finding people to build them he said we have the 
people here but theyre scattered around its hard to assemble a 
wellcoordinated design crew 
with enough effort there is still time for the united states to 
get into the market for advanced television 
the televisions will start out at 2500 or 3500 when they 
reach the market in the early 1990s and even by roughly 2001 will 
only capture about 1 percent of the world television market 
estimated john hatch a spokesman for the american electronics 
association 
after that though the market will take off reaching 20 
billion a year in the united states and 40 billion a year 
worldwide by 2010 hatch predicted 
one of the critical issues in highdefinition television is how 
to set standards for the new technology the standards that are 
picked will affect how well the united states can compete with the 
japanese 
some usbased companies are concerned that japanese companies 
could exert strong influence on the way standards are set in the 
united states through their influence in the consumer electronics 
group of the usbased electronic industries association 
zenith dropped out of the association last september 
complaining it was dominated by foreign concerns but continues 
to participate in its standardsetting efforts 
but mark rosenker the vice president for public affairs at the 
electronic industries association said the organization is working 
closely with other organizations such as the national association 
of broadcasters and wants to create a standard that is acceptable 
to everyone 
if we dont have consensus we could have a disaster on our 
hands rosenker said

pan am corp is in such desperate financial 
straits that it was forced to take the drastic step of proposing to 
sell the bulk of its assets financial analysts say 
the company said wednesday that its board of directors had 
authorized management to sell the assets if no agreement can be 
reached on labor concessions with three holdout unions 
pan am the nations eighth largest airline also plans to 
reduce its flight operations more than normal after the peak summer 
travel season 
it is a fact that pan ams financial condition is the worst 
in the industry said julius maldutis an airline analyst for 
investment firm salomon brothers inc there are some great risks 
associated with this strategy but pan am had no choice 
among those risks he said are the possibility that potential 
passengers could be scared away from pan am flights because of the 
impending sales and that many frequent fliers on the airline could 
stampede to cash in their travel awards 
pan am had a net loss of 833 million in the first quarter and 
is saddled with about 900 million in debt the airline posted 
staggering net losses of 2653 million in 1987 and 4628 million 
in 1986 
the two unions representing pilots and flight engineers agreed 
in january to wage cuts and work rule changes that are to save pan 
am 240 million over three years but analysts have estimated the 
airline needs total savings of around 540 million over that period 
to ensure its financial recovery 
the flight attendants teamsters and transport workers unions 
on the other hand have resisted taking pay cuts 
in exchange for the concessions from the pilots and flight 
engineers pan am undertook a major management shakeup in january 
in which the chairman and other top executives were replaced 
the plan to sell assets was widely viewed as a lastditch 
attempt to pressure the three recalcitrant unions as well as a 
measure of pan ams financial desperation 
i dont think pan am chairman thomas g plaskett had a lot 
of choice said john pincavage who follows the industry for 
investment firm painewebber inc in many respects its a warning 
shot 
plaskett told airline employees about the asset sales in a 
letter mailed tuesday night 
the boards decision authorized the sale of any of the assets of 
pan american world airways the companys main subsidiary 
without limitation including route segments and divisions 
maintenance and terminal facilities aircraft engines and other 
equipment plaskett wrote 
the only pan am assets that would not be considered for sale 
plaskett said are its profitable northeast shuttle service and pan 
am world services which provides ground services to other carriers 
in airports around the world 
if agreement was reached with the holdout unions there is a 
very good possibility that the assets might not be sold pan am 
spokeswoman pamela hanlon said wednesday 
the company had no specific timetable for selling the assets 
she said 
im taking the letter at face value i presume that theyre 
serious about selling assets said margaret brennan the head of 
the flight attendants union at pan am who also heads the joint 
labor council representing the five unions there 
brennan said the authorization to sell could be a tactic to 
force the three unions into making concessions she cautioned 
however that i dont think theyre going to accomplish anything 
with the flight attendants like this 
william genoese director of the teamsters unions airline 
division said he was considering calling a rally of his members to 
protest the pan am move they have to sit down with us he said 
the 4500member teamsters union at pan am threatened a strike 
against the carrier last winter and vowed guerrilla war tactics 
including deliberate diversions of baggage 
plaskett said in his letter that as a first step in its new 
plan pan am will substantially reduce the level of its flight 
operations in the fourth quarter far beyond the normal seasonal 
reduction following the summer peak 
pan am also will close its flight service base in san francisco 
on oct 1 and will return two 747 aircraft to their lessors when 
their leases expire at the end of the summer he said 
i am very disappointed that our inability to secure the cost 
reductions we so desperately need to continue implementing our 
growth plan has necessitated these and other planned actions

a pair of consumer groups say they will try to 
persuade a judge to reject a proposed settlement of a classaction 
lawsuit charging that the audi 5000 sedans accelerated on their own 
under the proposed settlement audi of america inc would offer 
rebates of 300 to 2000 to 390000 current or former owners of 
audi 5000 sedans with automatic transmissions if they buy a new 
audi between sept 1 1988 and june 30 1991 
the deal applies to audi 5000 sedans built between 1978 and 1986 
as part of the settlement which is subject to approval of a 
cook county circuit judge audi acknowledged no liability and 
attorneys who sued the company admitted they couldnt prove that 
any defect in audis cars caused sudden unintended acceleration 
the company based in troy mich has been plagued by 
allegations that its audi 5000 vehicles sometimes accelerate on 
their own causing drivers to lose control similar allegations 
have been leveled against other major automakers 
weve said all along there is nothing wrong with our cars 
there is no defect causing unintended acceleration audi 
spokesman tom mcdonald said wednesday id say its a 
victory 
but two consumer groups criticized the proposed settlement and 
vowed to try to persuade cook county circuit judge harold siegan to 
reject it siegan has scheduled a public hearing july 26 
i think its grossly inadequate said clarence ditlow of the 
center for auto safety a washingtonbased group that is 
investigating the problem of sudden acceleration in cars if any 
individual has had a sudden acceleration problem with an audi car 
probably the last thing they want to do is get another audi 
the center founded by ralph nader contends that at least 1650 
accidents have been linked to acceleration surges when the audi 
5000 was shifted from park into gear causing 402 injuries and 5 
deaths said jeff schroeder a vehicle safety investigator with the 
group 
the lawsuit filed in march 1987 sought to compensate audi 
owners for a loss in resale value caused by an allegedly defective 
automatic transmission 
settlement talks between the two sides began about six months 
ago said james dupree one of the attorneys who filed the 
classaction lawsuit 
in essence audi is using the court as part of a marketing 
program said mark steinbach an attorney for the audi victims 
network a group formed to pressure the government to investigate 
the sudden acceleration problem 
under the proposed settlement car owners would get cash 
payments or rebates on a sliding scale depending on the model year 
of the car they owned or leased and the date they buy a new audi 
they would have until june 30 1991 to buy a new audi 
for instance the owner of a 1986 audi 5000 who buys a new 1988 
model of any type of audi car before june 30 1989 would receive a 
2000 rebate that could either be taken in cash or applied toward 
the purchase 
audis sell for a range of 18000 to 35000 mcdonald said

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
says us manufacturers are working so close to capacity that a 
further decline of the dollar in foreign exchange would not help 
them sell more goods overseas 
the heads of the central banks of france and west germany said 
they agreed with greenspan that they saw no benefit in further 
depreciation of the dollar 
the bankers remarks which came on the closing day of the 34th 
annual international monetary conference were cited for helping 
the push the dollar higher against most major currencies on 
wednesday in foreign exchange trading 
in new york the dollar rose to 12562 japanese yen from 12552 
yen late tuesday for instance and to 17261 west german marks 
from 17113 marks 
speaking at a news media briefing at the close of the threeday 
conference greenspan said the adjustment process by which the 
dollar has depreciated over the past three years in an effort to 
enhance the us trade picture has made significant progress 
but he said the deterioration of the dollar will augment the 
dollardenominated us trade deficit rather than implement further 
progress 
greenspan said that because us manufacturers already are 
running at capacity or nearcapacity levels further declines could 
not do anything to help them sell more goods overseas or anywhere 
else 
earlier greenspan and top central bankers from japan west 
germany britain france and mexico discussed a variety of 
economic concerns including the us federal budget deficit and 
capital adequacy requirements for banks 
the bankers refused to disclose specifics but many including 
bundesbank president karl otto poehl and bank of france governor 
jacques de larosiere agreed with greenspan that they saw no 
benefit in the dollar depreciating further poehl however noted 
that the dollars depreciation in the past had helped the west 
german economy 
poehl assured reporters wednesday that recent reported dollar 
sales by the bundesbank were not part of an effort to drive down 
the us currency and boost the west german mark but rather a 
routine effort to trim his countrys dollar reserves 
the dollar has lost half its value against such currencies as 
the west german mark and japanese yen over the past three years 
although for the last year its value has been fairly stable it has 
fallen less against the currencies of such major trading partners 
as canada south korea hong kong and taiwan 
the stage was set for a drop in the dollar in september 1985 
when the united states and its four major trading partners agreed 
to devalue the currency to help reduce the spiralng us trade 
shortall and stave off protectionist legislation last year 
however that same group agreed that further decines in the 
dollars value would be counterproductive 
although the dollars depreciaton has failed to wipe out the 
huge us trade deficit which set a record 171 billion last year 
there has been significant improvement recently the deficit fell 
to 97 billion in march its lowest level in three years on the 
strength of us exports 
it the trade improvement is probably going at a pace about 
as fast as one should want it to go greenspan said 
to continue that momentum he and other central bankers said 
efforts should be made to reduce the huge us budget deficit the 
bankers also reiterated the need to keep inflation down as a way to 
continue economic growth worldwide 
in order to continue the adjustment of the trade imbalance 
in the long term that is obviously a necessary condition 
greenspan said

the internal revenue service is backing away 
from a ruling that could have required immediate taxation of 
accumulated vacation sick leave and other benefits paid to 
employees of state and local governments and taxexempt 
organizations 
although the irs now says it never had any intention of taxing 
such benefits union leaders say the agencys clarification on 
wednesday could benefit more than 14 million workers 
o donaldson chapoton assistant secretary of the treasury for 
tax policy said wednesday that pending irs regulations will spell 
out that bona fide vacation leave sick leave compensatory time 
severance pay disability pay and death benefits are not deferred 
compensation subject to tax under section 457 of the tax code 
chapoton outlined the governments position in a letter to rep 
ray mcgrath rny mcgrath a member of the house ways and means 
committee has been fighting an earlier irs interpretation that 
left open the door to taxation of certain employee benefits at the 
time they were accrued rather than when they were used 
it was never the intention of congress to allow the taxation 
of bona fide employee benefits mcgrath told reporters in 
releasing chapotons letter 
the change he said signifies the fact that the irs will not 
be picking the pockets of these kinds of taxpaying employees 
the debate centers on a 1978 law that allowed employees of state 
and local governments to take part in deferredcompensation 
retirement plans in 1986 congress brought employees of 
universities nonprofit hospitals and other taxexempt 
organizations under that law 
the irs traditionally considered immediately taxable only 
elective forms of deferred compensation such as salary that a 
worker voluntarily postponed receiving nonelective 
compensation where there is no option to receive it immediately 
was taxed when received rather than when it was earned 
in 1987 the irs issued a notice that was widely interpreted as 
requiring immediate taxation of nonelective compensation and 
extending that definition to such basic benefits as vacation and 
sick pay that set off an outcry by unions representing affected 
workers and by several members of congress 
under the irs interpretation many state and local governments 
and taxexempt employers would have to substantially restructure 
their compensation and retirement arrangements to bring them into 
compliance with the restrictions said sen daniel p moynihan 
dny author of a bill to overturn the initial irs position 
he said the 1987 interpretation would have placed such employers 
at a competitive disadvantage with private industry in keeping 
employees 
mcgrath said he had enlisted the help of vice president george 
bush in fighting the irs interpretation 
i called the vice president to explain the concerns of 
millions of union members and elected officials from new york and 
other states mcgrath said he contacted treasury secretary 
james baker who had the irs reconsider its position 
johnell hunter a spokesman for irs acknowledged the agencys 
1987 ruling had caused confusion but said we never intended to 
tax that compensation in the first place 
the 1987 ruling ms hunter said was to counter any abuse 
that might take place with individuals who get deferred 
compensation that is way out of synch with what it should be 
it was never intended to touch the ordinary worker

drexel burnham lambert inc says the securities 
and exchange commission plans to file civil charges against the 
investment firm although the firm says it has done nothing wrong 
spokesman steven anreder said wednesday that the sec has 
notified us that it has authorized its staff to file civil 
action but he would not comment on reports that the charges 
include securities fraud 
reading from a prepared statement anreder said while there 
is no certainty as to when the sec might actually file the charges 
we are eager to resolve this matter 
the new york times in todays editions reported that drexel 
chief executive frederick h joseph told the firms employees in a 
memo that the sec had authorized filing of charges of securities 
law violations against dreexel and four of its employees whom he 
did not identify 
the employees involved are believed to be chief junkbond dealer 
michael milken his brother lowell and two people described as 
traders according to unidentified sources quoted in todays wall 
street journal 
josephs memo also said the firm was prepared to negotiate a 
resolution of the charges with the sec even though he denied that 
the firm or its employees had engaged in any wrongdoing according 
to the times 
the newspaper said the memos emphasis was on drexels new 
willingness to settle any charges as a major financial 
institution we are aware of the benefits in getting this case 
behind us joseph was quoted as saying 
drexel has been the subject of investigations by the sec the 
us attorneys office and a federal grand jury since the breaking 
of the insider trading scandal surrounding former stock speculator 
ivan f boesky 
boesky who pleaded guilty to securities fraud in april 1987 is 
believed to have provided investigators with information related to 
alleged wrongdoing by drexel 
anreder said drexel is eager to have the opportunity to confront 
boesky who he described as a convicted felon and an admitted 
liar in a fair forum 
without boesky the principal source of the charges there 
would be no action anreder said from the very beginning of 
this investigation 18 months ago we have stated that we are 
unaware of any wrongdoing 
the washington post reported wednesday that the sec wanted to 
hold off action to avoid interfering with the criminal 
investigation by the us attorneys office in new york 
the head of the secs enforcement division gary lynch and 
officials at the office of rudolph giuliani the us attorney in 
manhattan both declined comment 
sec chairman david s ruder also declined to comment on drexel 
but he said wednesday that he had requested more resources be 
devoted to investigating securities law violations 
we have urged the justice department to give increased 
resources to the criminal investigation of securities law 
violations he told reporters during a break in an unrelated 
congressional hearing 
while there has been some increment in the resources of the 
new york office we think there could be more and we think there 
could be more throughout the country he said 
drexel acknowledged in february that it and some of its 
employees had been targeted for civil charges by the sec staff 
milken the best known drexel executive pioneered the market for 
highyield highrisk bonds that have become a staple of drexels 
business 
during congressional hearings in april milken refused to 
testify confirming he was under investigation by a grand jury in 
new york

meetings among the oil ministers of six 
arab members of opec have failed to produce any agreement on 
production quotas delegation sources said thursday 
the meetings taking place on the sidelines of a threeday arab 
summit involve discussions between the two opposing wings of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the six oil ministers from algeria libya iraq saudi arabia 
qatar and the united arab emirates met in advance of the scheduled 
june 11 meeting of opec in vienna hoping to resolve their 
differences in informal talks 
algeria and libya advocate production cuts while saudi arabia 
and the gulf emirates have defended their production levels the 
split between the two camps led to the failure of an april meeting 
between opec and a number of nonopec oil exporters 
the nonopec countries had offered to reduce their overall 
output by 5 percent or 183000 barrels per day on condition the 
opec group made a matching 5 percent cut 
the opec countries which have a current overall production 
ceiling of 1506 million barrels per day offered to match the 
proposed nonopec cut barrelperbarrel but could not agree on an 
overall 5 percent cut which would have lowered their ceiling by 
about 750000 barrels per day 
indonesias oil minister ginanjar kartasasnita earlier this 
week called on the arab opec members to resolve their differences 
at the algiers summit to help stabilize prices 
the sources participants in the talks who spoke on condition 
they not be identifed said the informal discussions in algiers had 
disclosed three factions among the arab opec members 
the saudiled group was demanding that current production levels 
be left unchanged while the algeria group called for a sharp 
production cut for the third quarter of 1988 with a possibility of 
renewed increases in the fourth quarter to take account of higher 
winter demand a third group advocated simple alignment with world 
prices and demand the sources said 
the sources said they doubted the differences would be resolved 
before the arab ministers traveled to vienna next week 
iraq which has refused to be bound by its opecfixed production 
ceiling also took part in the talks the sources said iraq has 
demanded a production quota equal to that of its gulf war enemy

has bought the swimming pool and snow goods divisions of coleco for 
an undisclosed price the deal included a 315000squarefoot 
factory in mayfield ny 
the coleco divisions which slm said had annual sales of 35 
million in 1987 represent 45 percent of the domestic product lines

increased us production of japanese 
cars and nearly steady import levels will force the big three to 
make fewer small cars and probably close some plants a new 
analysts study shows 
by 1990 overcrowding in the market will force general motors 
corp to close its chevrolet cavalierpontiac sunbird plant in 
lordstown ohio and ford motor co to close its edison nj 
escort plant according to the prediction wednesday by the wharton 
econometrics forecasting associates 
gm ford and chrysler corp also will have to reduce production 
of other small cars ford of the tempotopaz gm of the chevrolet 
corsicaberetta and the pontiac grand am and chrysler of the 
omnihorizon the kcar and its replacement which will be 
introduced in 1989 and the lebaron the study predicted 
the big three would replace their own small cars with cars 
produced by their japanese partners overseas and in us 
jointventure assembly plants all three already sell such cars 
under their own nameplates the cuts in big three production would 
nearly equal the increase in output by japaneseowned us plants 
by 1990 it said 
the study by analyst edward sullivan does not show japanese 
automakers reducing exports to the united states as their us 
production increases despite the likelihood the dollar will 
remain weak against the japanese yen at least through 1993 
we firmly believe that they brought those plants in here to 
avoid protectionism and to increase their market share to 
expand and penetrate the market sullivan said 
restrictions on japanese imports to the united states in the 
early 1980s and the japanese governments voluntary continuation of 
them since limited japanese automakers to about 23 million car 
exports to this country each year 
by 1990 nearly every major japanese automaker will have at 
least one us factory honda motor co and toyota motor corp will 
have two each production at japaneseowned us and canadian 
plants will double from 730000 cars in 1987 to 14 million by 
1990 sullivan predicted 
but japanese imports will fall by only 100000 units or a 
reduction of 13 imports for every 100 usproduced japanese cars 
the study predicted 
the result will be a 600000car overall increase in japanese 
sales in the united states and an increase in their share of the 
us market sullivans figures showed 
since 1986 the value of the yen against the dollar has doubled 
but while the dollar is expected to fall further through 1993 the 
decline will be much smaller than the plunge of 19861988 
meanwhile japanese automakers already have adapted to the stronger 
yen by cutting costs and improving efficiency 
because of this sullivan said the japanese face very little 
price disadvantage against the big three and by 1990 would be able 
to cut prices slightly 
while japanese imports will decline slightly the study showed 
imports from south korea and other newly industrialized countries 
increasing boosting total car imports by about 50000 in 1989 
before a slight drop in 1990 
the study predicts total 1988 us car and light truck sales 
imported and domestic at about 152 million only slightly lower 
than big three projections of 153 million 1989 total sales at 
147 million and 1990 sales at 141 million 
weve hit our sales peak were coming down the question is 
how fast sullivan said 
light truck sales which have grown steadily during the 1980s 
will be hit harder than car sales during a recession in 19891990 
sullivan said because the recession will cause a drop in business 
investment

an interior department official told a house 
subcommittee today that the best way to preserve the arctic 
national wildlife refuge is to authorize exploration and 
development of its potentially rich oil deposits 
the greatest risk to the refuge is to prevent exploration 
and development in a sound and orderly way said j steven 
griles assistant interior secretary for land and mineral 
management 
griles and other advocates of opening americas biggest wildlife 
refuge to oil rigs said that the refuge could be hurt if a nation 
faced another oil crisis that forced congress into a crash program 
to find new sources of domestic petroleum 
he appeared before the house interior water and power resources 
subcommittee which is taking up the administrations controversial 
refugedrilling proposal as time is running out in the 100th 
congress 
on wednesday interior secretary donald hodel announced that he 
was shelving one of the more controversial aspects of the push to 
open the refuge 
put on indefinite hold was the proposal to trade away 
taxpayerowned mineral rights on 166000 acres of the refuge on 
alaskas north slope 
the announcement was made by interior secretary donald hodel on 
the eve of hearings by the house interior water and power resources 
subcommittee into the larger question of allowing drilling on the 
refuges 15 millionacre coastal plain 
the interior committee is one of the final congressional 
battlegrounds for the outgoing administration in its 18monthold 
struggle against the calendar and environmentconservation lobby 
over the future of the refuge 
hodel said the plan to trade the mineral rights for 891000 
acres elsewhere in alaska was being put on hold at least until 
after congress decides whether to open the refuge to petroleum 
development 
in a prepared statement hodel said he was indefinitely delaying 
publication of a legislative environmental impact statement leis 
on the trade the necessary study document that would be used to 
justify the deal 
hodel and other interior officials have pushed the trade as a 
way of acquiring valuable fish and wildlife property owned by 
aleut eskimo and other native corporations which are anxious to 
get in on the possible oil rush 
from the start it has been our position that congress first 
must approve legislation to allow oil and gas leasing in the anwr 
coastal plain and second must adopt legislation to ratify the 
agreements before the proposed exchanges could take effect hodel 
said 
therefore i believe it would be premature to publish the 
draft leis on the proposed exchanges until congress clarifies its 
intent on anwr said hodel who has gotten drilling legislation 
approved by the senate energy and natural resources and the house 
merchant marine and fisheries committees 
facing strong opposition from environmentalists and 
conservationists the administration and oil industry have argued 
that the refuge offers the best hope of finding a new major source 
of domestic petroleum 
bob walker an interior department spokesman said the fish and 
wildlife service was right at the brink of issuing the 
landexchange leis when hodel ordered the delay 
the process is on hold and the leis is on the shelf he said 
walker said the decision had nothing to do with a 
soontobereleased assessment by the congressional general 
accounting office that reportedly concludes the proposed trade is a 
bad deal for taxpayers 
he said the decision was made because we didnt want the land 
trade muddying the waters on whether to develop the refuge the 
fear was once we put out the leis it would appear we were 
bulldozing ahead

following up on the senate vote sustaining his 
veto of a trade bill president reagan telephoned democratic and 
republican congressional leaders today to urge prompt action on a 
new bill to strengthen americas position in the global marketplace 
the senate fell five votes short wednesday of the twothirds 
majority required to make the trade measure law despite reagans 
objections 
the will of the senate was expressed yesterday in sustaining 
the presidents veto and we are proceeding to work with the 
leadership in developing a new bill white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said 
president reagan is calling a number of members today to urge 
them to proceed as rapidly as possible on a new bill and i think we 
will be able to show some movement very soon fitzwater said 
the spokesman declined to identify the members the president was 
calling but said they were the leaders who have been involved in 
the development of this trade bill over a long period of time and 
included both democrats and republicans 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said he is 
willing to draft a new trade measure that reagan might be willing 
to sign but he acknowledged that its a little late in the day 
to be talking about a second bill 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva took another tack 
although he strongly supported the trade bill at the last minute 
he voted against it a parliamentary maneuver that could later 
allow him to ask for reconsideration of the 1000page bill 
this is insurance that the american people can still have a 
trade bill this year said byrd who argued that efforts to draft 
a new measure could become hopelessly bogged down in debate over 
complex amendments 
fitzwater said byrds action does complicate it and we 
certainly are discouraged that he would try to do that it is 
certainly clear that the president wants a trade bill the 
republicans want a trade bill the democrats most of them want a 
trade bill and we would like to see it proceed as quickly as 
possible 
the centerpiece provisions of the bill reagan vetoed would 
revamp the governments system for imposing import curbs to aid 
us industries and retaliate against trade violations 
others range from sizable farm export subsidies to repeal of the 
1980 windfall profits tax on oilindustry earnings 
but those were overshadowed in recent weeks by reagans 
objections to a provision to require companies with 100 employees 
or more to provide 60day notice of plant closings and largescale 
layoffs 
republican critics objected to what they called specialinterest 
provisions and lingering protectionism in the bill while 
supporters in both parties claimed it was vital to farmers and 
heavy industries suffering from trade upheavals 
the house voted overwhelmingly to override the veto last month 
and some of the administrations supporters have said they would 
feel more comfortable if they could get a second crack at the issue 
before having to face the voters in the fall elections democrats 
made no effort to disguise their belief that the trade issue can be 
translated into votes 
we may lose the battle but weve won the war on this issue 
said sen max baucus dmont this is no longer an issue between 
the congress and the white house it is now a presidential campaign 
issue 
the democratic presidential nomineetobe michael dukakis has 
supported the plantclosing provision and opposed reagans veto 
republican george bush has sided with reagan 
sen pete v domenici rnm a critic of the bill said this 
controversy with the president is not about trade it is not even 
about economics it is about politics 
he pointed to a sharp rise in us exports since three years ago 
when record us trade deficits combined with layoffs in heavy 
industries ignited the congressional fight over the issue 
the final vote to override was 6137 five votes short of the 
required twothirds of those present and voting sen joseph biden 
ddel and arlen specter rpa both recuperating from surgery 
were not present 
ten republicans abandoned the white house to vote in favor of 
the override effort two democrats voted to sustain reagans veto 
the reagan administration on wednesday renewed its call for 
trade legislation stripped of the plantclosings provision it has 
opposed that feature on grounds that it would rob management of 
flexibility 
the administration also objects to restrictions the bill would 
place on alaskan oil exports 
byrd said however that even in the case of a fresh piece of 
legislation the plantclosings provision would be offered as an 
amendment and that he would vote in favor of it 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said it still was 
possible to achieve trade legislation this year but he said it 
would be necessary for leaders to circle the wagons and bar 
amendments 
told that byrd had just promised that he would vote in favor of 
a plantclosings provision as part of any new bill dole said 
that makes it more difficult 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said that the issue cannot be 
swept under the white house rug 
if another trade bill is introduced with an advance notice 
requirement i will work hard for its passage he said if a 
trade bill is introduced without a notice requirement i will work 
hard to add one 
sen bill armstrong rcolo declared that the bill was 
easily one of the worst ideas that congress has cooked up in a 
long time and jampacked with benefits for specialinterest 
manufacturers 
the us chamber of commerce a fierce foe of the plantclosings 
provision issued a statement from vice president william t archey 
saying it was time to preserve the best of the bill minus the 
notice feature we cannot let those efforts die he said 
the aflcio declared that fairness and decency were voted 
down in the plantclosings issue it vowed not to support a 
trade bill stripped of a conscience and blind to the community 
miseries caused by shutdowns planned and executed in secret

the merchandise trade deficit for march was 
revised upward 22 percent to 119 billion under a system of 
seasonal adjustments that is being resumed the government said 
today 
the commerce department released new trade figures that for the 
first time in two years adjusted the monthly numbers for normal 
seasonal changes in shipping patterns 
a month ago the government had reported that the trade deficit 
was at 97 billion its best showing in three years however 
analysts cautioned at the time that trade figures often improve in 
march because it is a good month for us export sales 
a february deficit which had originally been reported at 138 
billion was raised to 144 billion 
the january deficit originally reported as 124 billion was 
lowered by the seasonal adjustment to 113 billion 
the april trade deficit is scheduled to be reported next tuesday 
and it will be reported on a seasonally adjusted basis although the 
government will continue to release the unadjusted figures as well 
government statisticians hope that by seasonally adjusting the 
trade figures they will be able to smooth out some of the 
volatility that has often roiled financial markets around the world 
the us trade deficit has become the most closely watched 
government statistic especially on foreign exchange markets a bad 
trade figure can trigger a wave of dollar selling which then 
depresses stock prices as investors become worried about us 
economic prospects 
despite the revised figures white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said the data still showed a favorable downward trend in 
the us deficit 
the trade deficit is on a downward trend exports are 
increasing and its a very encouraging picture in terms of the 
foreign trade deficit he said 
commerce undersecretary robert ortner who briefed reporters on 
the historical revisions said the trade deficit for the first 
three months of this year is running at an annual rate of 150 
billion which if it holds for the entire year would be a 
substantial improvement from the record 1703 billion deficit 
recorded in 1987 
this figure was revised slightly downward from a previously 
reported 1712 billion deficit but this change did not reflect 
seasonal adjustments but rather the inclusion of previously 
unreported export sales 
before 1986 the government had always adjusted the monthly 
import and export figures to smooth out seasonal shipping patterns 
just as it adjusts most of its other statistical reports however 
it was forced to abandon the practice for a time when a tide of 
imports overwhelmed the ability of the customs service to process 
the trade information on a timely basis 
in some months the socalled carryover of late information on 
imports from previous months accounted for 50 percent of the new 
months total 
that figure has now been reduced to around 3 percent per month

grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on 
the chicago board of trade following some badly needed and 
unexpectedly widespread rain in the midwest 
showers brought slight relief wednesday to much of iowa 
illinois and indiana which together produce most of the midwests 
corn and soybeans 
but predictions for another spell of hot dry weather limited 
the early rainrelated losses analysts said 
i think the markets overdid it yesterday said joel karlin 
an analyst in chicago with research department inc admittedly 
we did have about 40 percent rain coverage particularly in iowa 
but that will be mitigated by the fact were supposed to have a 
return to hot dry conditions by this weekend 
the us oat crop got no reprieve from the punishing weather 
however karlin said that unless it rains within the next week in 
the northern plains you might as well kiss the oat and spring 
wheat crops goodbye 
in early trading wheat was cent to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 370 a bushel corn was 7 cents 
lower to 2 cents higher with july at 245 a bushel oats were 2 
cents to 9 cents higher with july at at 243 a bushel soybeans

the first major expansion of medicare in 23 
years is headed to the white house where president reagans chief 
spokesman said today the legislation to protect americas elderly 
from the financial ruin of serious illness is viewed with favor 
the president is very concerned about longterm health care 
as he has said a number of times white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said we dont want to forecast the final action on 
this bill but we look favorably upon it 
vice president george bush declared his support for the bill 
saying it means the elderly will not have to live in fear that 
their lifes savings would be wiped out by a prolonged 
hospitalization 
although the catastrophic illness bill given final legislative 
approval wednesday by the senate is more ambitious than the 
proposal laid out by president reagan the administrations no 1 
health official has said he will ask the president to sign it 
there was no reaction from the white house to the senates 8611 
approval of the measure which came a week after the house voted in 
similarly overwhelming fashion for the compromise worked out in 
months of negotiations among house and senate conferees and 
administration observers 
this gives additional peace of mind to millions of 
americans sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the finance committee 
chairman who guided the measure in the senate said just before 
final approval 
sen bill bradley dnj a member of the conference committee 
that worked out the final compromise last month said the 
legislation is not perfect but it will vastly improve the lives 
of millions of elderly americans who have high health care bills 
this can truly be called landmark legislation said sen max 
baucus dmont another conference committee member 
but sen bill armstrong rcolo one of the 11 who voted 
against the measure complained that it is going to cost 
everybody and help very few 
indeed proponents never argued that the bill will have an 
automatic benefit for each of the nations 32 million medicare 
beneficiaries 29 million of them past age 65 the other 3 million 
qualify for the federal health program because they are medically 
disabled 
senate action on the catastrophic health bill came shortly after 
the house killed a separate measure that would have provided 
extensive home benefits for people not sick enough to require 
hospitalization or nursing home care 
even though it was not intended primarily as a vehicle for 
improving longterm care benefits the new medicare legislation 
does make some improvements in that area as well 
for example it extends the coverage available for people who 
need skilled nursing care in nursing homes from 100 days a year to 
150 it also will enable an elderly person left at home to keep 
more money when his or her spouse has to go into a nursing home for 
an indefinite stay paid for by medicaid the government health 
program for the poor 
leaders in both the house and senate have said longterm care 
will head the domestic agenda in the next congress 
in essence the new legislation provides a safety net for 
medicare beneficiaries faced with extraordinary expenses from acute 
illnesses such as cancer 
beyond that it introduces a general prescription drug benefit 
into the medicare program for the first time albeit only for 
those who run up more than 600 a year in drug bills 
the bill is drawn with the idea that potential beneficiaries 
will foot the entire cost of the expanded benefits which are 
estimated to cost 326 billion over the next five years 
each of the 32 million will be assessed 400 a month in flat 
medicare premiums to pay for the additional coverage 
in addition the estimated 40 percent of the recipients with 
enough income to make them subject to federal income taxes about 
10000 minimum a year for an individual will be charged a 
supplemental premium that amounts to a surtax on their income tax 
liability 
on the benefit side the measure provides full hospital coverage 
after a onceayear deductible estimated at 564 in 1989 medicare 
now pays full charges for no more than 59 days a year and the 
recipient is subject to a deductible for each hospitalization 
the bill also caps outofpocket costs for doctor bills at 
1370 a year after a 75 deductible medicare now pays 80 percent 
of approved doctor bills and that part of the program remains 
intact starting in 1989 however the 75 deductible and the 20 
percent share paid by beneficiaries counts toward the 1370 cap 
after that is reached medicare pays 100 percent of approved doctor 
bills 
however the beneficiary will remain liable for any portion of 
doctor bills that exceed the set fees approved by medicare 
the new drug benefit calls for medicare to pay half of 
outpatient prescription drug costs in 1991 after a 600 deductible 
is met the government share rises to 60 percent in 1992 and 80 
percent in 1993 however the deductible is expected to rise each 
year to keep pace with rising drug costs 
the supplemental premium starts at 2250 a year for each 150 
of income tax owed in 1989 climbing to an additional 42 a year on 
each 150 of tax liability by 1993 there is an 800 cap on the 
supplemental premium in 1989 climbing to 1050 in 1993

he is a member of the church was baptized in it and he has 
never left it archbishop iakovos says of the frontrunning 
democratic presidential contender who has been assailed as an 
apostate 
the attack is wrong in itself iakovos added in an 
interview his eyes flashed it came from small people 
in widely distributed letters james g jatras a staff member 
of the senate republican policy committee and a church layman 
called dukakis a renegade an outcast for his positions and his 
marriage to a jew 
jatras writing under his greek name dimitrios iatreidis said 
dukakis church membership was severed by your marriage outside 
the church iakovos termed that untrue 
the whitehaired archbishop 76 who has maintained 
relationships with dukakis and his parents since his boyhood noted 
that dukakis considers him his spiritual father and added 
we are proud that one of our young men has had the courage and 
determination to run for the highest office in the nation

michael is a man who does much thinking who doesnt react

learned he is moderate not a man of extremes hes very prudent 
very careful very studious 
of dukakis marriage to a nonchristian which under church 
rules technically bars him from receiving communion as are 
divorced remarried roman catholics but does not excommunicate or 
remove him from membership iakovos said 
he did not leave the church he is not excluded hes not the 
only one who has married outside the church 
the archbishop said about 70 percent of greek orthodox marriages 
are with those of other denominations an increasing number with 
jews

pastoral obligation to all our people to strengthen and encourage 
them 
he noted that dukakis visited archdiocesan headquarters on 
manhattans east 79th st on april 14 took part in vespers 
services and afterward met with iakovos in his chandeliered 
secondfloor offices 
we had a brief service in the chapel he said then we 
discussed freely some of the issues 
jatras made his charges in an open letter to dukakis sent to all 
orthodox bishops and many others as well as in letters to the 
weekly greek american which termed the attack a cheap political 
ploy 
jatras claimed dukakis excommunicated himself by marriage to 
a jew and is a traitor who defames our church by upholding 
legal abortion and opposing aid to contra rebels in nicaragua 
the archbishop said it was fanatic to attack a candidates 
church relationship i find it extremely unjustified to make such 
statements to attack anyone running for any office on the basis of 
his beliefs 
in this multicultural multinational society religion is 
not one of the criteria for being elected president of the united 
states 
while greek orthodoxy opposes abortion he said dukakis 
position resembled that of new york governor cuomo a roman 
catholic in contending political leaders must uphold the law and 
not try to impose their views about it 
the president is president of all citizens believers and 
nonbelievers as well iakovos said any transgressions across 
the border between state and church is at the expense of the unity 
of the nation 
he said he had encouraged dukakis decision to seek the 
presidency 
asked about dukakis religious commitment iakovos said this 
is a very subjective matter but dukakis has been a steady church 
member he has embraced it all these years this is not something 
new many times he would say i was his spiritual father 
through the campaign i think he is feeling much closer to the 
community than before 
he said that it seemed strange the attack about dukakis 
religion didnt come until he was running for the presidency but 
then they start scrutinizing his conformity to church rules 
if the man is qualified and god wants him to be president he 
will be michael has some of the qualities we seek in that 
position

japans trade surplus fell 21 percent to 505 
billion in may the 13th straight month the surplus has decreased 
from its level of a year earlier the finance ministry said 
thursday 
japans trade surplus with the united states fell 256 percent 
to 330 billion from 444 billion in may 1987 it was also down 
from 413 billion the previous month 
economists were divided over whether the trade deficit would 
continue to shrink 
in a word i think we can say things have been moving in a 
desirable direction said toshiaki kakimoto chief economist at 
sumitomo bank ltd 
imports are likely to continue to grow while the yens 
appreciation and the shift in production to overseas by japanese 
manufacturers will restrain exports leading to a continued drop in 
the trade surplus kakimoto said 
but it is possible the trade surplus will not diminish further 
in coming months said yoshihiro furukane senior economist at 
yamaichi research institute of economics 
although imports are growing exports are also up because 
japanese manufacturers have found ways to cope with the strength of 
the yen furukane said 
mays overall trade surplus was down from 642 billion in the 
same month last year and from 677 billion in april according to 
figures the ministry released 
japans trade surplus has shrunk in comparison with the same 
month a year earlier since may 1987 reflecting the sharp rise in 
the value of the yen and expanding domestic demand in the japanese 
economy 
imports surged 267 percent to 1545 billion from 122 billion 
in may 1987 although they dipped 17 percent from aprils 157 
billion 
exports also continued to show considerable growth though the 
pace of increase has varied from month to month recently 
exports were up 102 percent to 205 billion from 186 billion 
in may 1987 but showed an 88 percent drop from 225 billion in 
april of this year 
imports of manufactured goods continued to be strong accounting 
for 486 percent of the countrys total imports in may that was 
down slightly from 499 percent in april 
the finance ministry trade figures were calculated on a 
customsclearance basis with shipping and insurance costs included 
for imports but not for exports japans trade surplus would have 
been larger if the costs had been included in both categories

if you dieted the way uncle sam diets you too 
would have a pot his pot is more financial than physical but the 
principle is the same 
when uncle sam diets he grows in size he grows in size because 
he kids himself about the numbers he lives by and because he snacks 
between meals gobbling up financial calories that he tends not to 
count 
if you went on a comparable food diet you first would add 
numbers to the weight that appeared on the scale and then you 
would deduct from that inflated figure and you wouldnt count any 
pounds that came from snacking 
the results would be exactly what you deserved for kidding 
yourself you would gain weight while telling yourself and anybody 
else who might listen that you were losing pounds sooner or later 
your credibility would shrink 
the subject arises for at least two reasons the annual budget 
debate is under way and this is a presidential election year which 
makes it a year of big dreams and unrealistic promises 
the primary claim to be made is that the budget has been cut 
repeatedly during the 1980s the fact is there has been no 
budgetary diet at all since 1980 
oh there have been socalled tax cuts but some of the cuts 
havent been cuts theres been a lot of snacking going on too or 
tax increases made without much publicity or at least not as much 
as the socalled cuts 
theres no other way to explain how 1988 spending is estimated 
to be about 106 trillion versus 591 billion in 1980 
marginal tax rates were reduced by the 1981 economic recovery 
tax act but taxes in total werent cut in addition the snacking 
continued four big tax increases altogether nibbled away the 
impact of the 1981 rate cut 
the truth according to citizens for a sound economy a 
nonprofit budgetwatching group is that in spite of all the talk 
of financial dieting uncle sams spending has risen 79 percent or 
59 billion a year since 1980 
why then has there been so much talk about budget cutting 
the answer lies in the practice of current services 
budgeting an odd twostep planning tool that serves to fool in 
the first step you raise the numbers beyond what they really are 
you then cut back from the larger number 
it appears not to matter that reality financial reality is 
ignored as much in this diet as pounds often are in the dieting 
procedures that rely on selfdelusion 
a current services budget automatically assumes spending will 
rise in the next year therefore proposed spending levels are 
compared not to how much is being spent in the current year but to 
how much could be spent in the next 
for instance says dan mitchell of the sound economy group if 
the current services budget foresees a program costing 10 percent 
more but the president or congress proposes a 4 percent increase 
the effect is a 6 percent cut 
theres nothing wrong with the concept says mitchell but 
theres a lot wrong with the practice 
the type of information it provides telling policymakers how 
much spending would have to rise to keep pace with inflation 
demographic changes and changes in the law is valuable says 
mitchell 
but he adds the practice of making it a yardstick against 
which all budget proposals are judged quite definitely is 
misleading it also is confusing and to some ways of thinking it 
is quite irrational 
as irrational in fact as a guy with a pot seeking your 
approval for all the hard work and deprivation he endured in 
cutting his weight from 300 pounds to just 500

pay increases should average about 5 percent 
this year and next for the nations salaried workforce narrowly 
outpacing expected inflation according to a survey released 
thursday 
the conference board a private businessinformation group 
reported the salaries of workers who were covered by overtime and 
other labor law provisions such as clerical workers would rise an 
average of 48 percent this year 
salaries of exempt workers such as management and 
professionals would rise an average of 5 percent while executive 
salary increases would average 54 percent the group reported 
average increases for 1989 were virtually the same in all three 
groups according to the conference boards salary survey of 649 
companies 
management appears determined to keep average salary increases 
to about 5 percent and not permit an upward escalation said 
charles peck the groups compensation analyst if inflation 
nudges up however it will be more difficult to hold the salary 
increase line at 5 percent 
the conference boards economic forum has projected inflation 
as measured by consumer price increases of 45 percent this year 
and 47 percent in 1989 compared with 36 percent in 1987 
the survey also indicated that 8 percent of the surveyed 
companies were giving some of their employees lumpsum payments 
instead of pay raises

the united states is examining a french 
proposal to forgive some of the debts of the worlds poorest 
countries the state department said thursday 
the proposal was transmitted in a letter to president ronald 
reagan by french president francois mitterrand said deputy 
spokesman phyllis oakley 
the french government announced wednesday that it would forgive 
onethird of such debts to it and would advise other members of the 
paris club which includes the major creditor governments to do 
the same 
the plan would not apply to the worlds most indebted developing 
nations such as brazil and mexico because they are not among the 
poorest although france indicated it believed ways also must be 
found to help them 
we are studying the french proposal very closely said mrs

campeau corps elimination of thousands of jobs 
at federated department stores inc will result in a more 
costeffective organization wall street analysts say but they 
also expect the cuts to affect the merchandise the stores offer 
there will be much more efficiency here after the 
reductions said walter loeb a retail industry analyst with the 
investment firm morgan stanley amp co 
but william smith at smith barney harris upham amp co said of 
the streamlining you hope its being done strategically 
the string of layoffs announced over recent days were expected 
after financier robert campeau took control of federated in a 66 
billion tender offer last month after buying allied stores corp 
at the end of 1986 campeau made similar cuts 
so far there have been layoffs at five of the six federated 
department store divisions and among the companys corporate staff 
goldsmiths a sixstore chain based in memphis tenn fired 25 
percent of its 2400 employees and at columbus ohiobased 
lazarus 1200 people were let go representing 8 percent of the 
employees at its 43 stores 
abraham and straus a new yorkbased chain with 14 stores laid 
off 794 employees or 7 percent of its work force while burdines 
in miami with 27 stores let go 320 workers or 3 percent 
atlantabased richs with 20 stores laid off 250 workers or 3 
percent and federateds corporate staff lost 207 employees or 40 
percent 
bloomingdales federateds star division also is expected to 
announce layoffs reports have said at least 400 employees or 3 
percent of the divisions work force will be cut 
some of these layoffs were the result of consolidation of 
divisions goldsmiths is being merged into richs and the 
centralized operations of federated will be combined with those of 
allied stores corp campeaus other retail division 
carol sanger a federated spokeswoman said the cuts were being 
made in back of the house operations buying and sales staffs 
were not affected she said and consumers should not see any 
changes in merchandising or customer service 
just because you let someone go in the credit office or the 
distribution office doesnt mean what you see on the sales floor 
will be any different she said 
joele frank a campeau spokeswoman said some buying operations 
would be centralized and become more cost effective under the old 
federated system one clothing manufacturer would deal separately 
with the various divisions and sometimes had different prices for 
each she said 
some analysts worried about the ultimate effect the changes 
would have on the merchandise customers will find at federateds 
stores 
monroe h greenstein an analyst with bear stearns amp co said 
he thinks store buyers were among those let go and he expects 
merchandise to reflect such layoffs 
typically when you sharply cut back your number of buyers 
youre buying more of the same lines at your stores greenstein 
said 
smith the analyst at smith barney said if in normal times 
youd see a cutback like this youd think theyd pay more and buy 
better merchandise i doubt thats whats in mr campeaus mind 
right now 
the result at federated analysts said will be part of a trend 
in retailing nationwide toward sameness similar merchandise 
offered by many stores with less selection available industry 
observers are critical of sameness saying it reduces 
innovativeness and creativity 
a company like federated needs a very refined buying procedure 
to have distinctiveness among the stores said loeb at morgan 
stanley 
but robert buchanan an analyst with ag edwards amp sons inc in 
st louis said there still can be room for input from the various 
divisions 
its up to the local department store buyers to determine how 
much they want what sizes what colors what styles he said 
smith warned that the wrong cuts could hurt at bloomingdales 
which thrives on its unique and trendy ambiance 
but the analysts also note that the reductions were long overdue 
one of the criticisms of federated over the years and that 
impeded their performance and put them into a position to be ripe 
for takeover is they failed to make the kind of consolidations in 
operations that would have made them more costeffective said 
smith 
campeau is not the only one trimming department store staffs 
may department stores inc which bought the foleys and 
filenes divisions from federated after campeau took control has 
announced it is laying off 800 employees or 5 percent of the 
foleys work force 
rh macy amp co inc which bought federateds bullocks and i 
magnin divisions declined to comment on whether it planned any 
layoffs

a consumer groups accusation that the sporty 
suzuki samurai is prone to roll over was denounced thursday by the 
japanese automaker as inaccurate and defamatory 
test results announced last week by consumers union the new 
york publisher of consumer reports magazine unfairly suggest the 
popular fourwheel drive vehicle is unsafe under normal driving 
conditions said doug mazza vice president and general manager of 
american suzuki motor corp 
if the magazine had acted responsibly and reviewed the 
available information it would have been aware that the samurai has 
one of the best records on file mazza said 
last week the influential consumer organization condemned the 
samurai as being so prone to roll over that it cannot be modified 
to be safe consumers union recommended a omplete recall of the 
120000 or more samurais sold in america and a complete refund to 
owners 
responding to the accusations made by suzuki in news conferences 
in los angeles new york and detroit consumers union spokesman 
david berliner defended the organizations tests as valid he said 
similar vehicles made by competitors passed the same tests that 
caused the samurai to tip over 
government accident statistics and tests conducted by an 
independent automotive safety consultant showed the samurai was as 
safe or safer than other sportutility vehicles mazza said that 
industry term refers to fourwheel drive cars and light pickup 
trucks 
samurai is considering legal action against consumers union 
mazza said he suggested the consumer group made its accusations as 
part of a calculated campaign to persuade the government to adopt 
stricter rollover standards 
for years the consumers union has been pressing the government 
for an unrealistic rollover standard mazza said what better 
way than pressing the smallest japanese automaker with the no 1 
selling sportutility vehicle

farmers are harvesting a winter wheat crop 
estimated at 157 billion bushels slightly larger than last years 
but 3 percent under a forecast of 162 billion bushels issued a 
month ago the agriculture department said thursday 
the 50 million bushel cutback in the forecast came amid an early 
drought across the midcontinent 
inadequate moisture and disease plagued winter wheat in the 
central and northern great plains during may the departments 
agricultural statistics board said in its report 
some officials said satellite photos show streak mosaic disease 
is taking a toll on soft red winter wheat in kansas and that the 
dry weather could worsen the situation there but they said a 
little rain could cut damage to a minimum in other parts of the 
country 
the new forecast compares with a 1987 winter wheat output of 
156 billion bushels officials said average yield should by 394 
bushels an acre down 04 bushels an acre from the 1987 level and 
13 bushels below the may estimate 
crop conditions vary the departments agricultural statistics 
board said in its report as of may 29 crop conditions were mostly 
fair to good in the corn belt southeast and pacific northwest and 
fair in the plains states it said 
development of the crop was average or better except in the 
pacific northwest and colorado it said the wheat was turning 
color in illinois kansas and missouri and the harvest had moved 
into oklahoma and expanded across the delta and southeast 
farmers are expected to have about 398 million acres for 
harvest this year the same estimate the department issued last 
month and 1 percent above the level for last season 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following 
summer it makes up about threefourths of total us wheat 
production 
no 1988 production estimates for spring wheat corn and other 
springplanted crops were included in the forecast they will be 
estimated by usda later in the growing season 
a separate supply and demand report from the departments 
economic research service did say that despite the estimated 50 
millionbushel cutback the overall us wheat crop should be above 
last years level it said that was so because of projected spring 
wheat production 
it said moreover that flour and related food production would 
be lower by perhaps 35 million bushels and the reduction should 
offset somewhat the reduced supply of winter wheat thus it 
projected only a slight reduction in the nations wheat stockpile 
the kansas winter wheat crop as usual the largest by far was 
estimated at 329 million bushels down from 3663 million in 1987 
the yield was put at 35 bushels per acre compared with 37 bushels 
last year the states farmers also trimmed their acreage to 94 
million acres from 99 million in 1987 
indicated production of winter wheat and average yields in 1988 
by major producing states based on june 1 prospects included 
arkansas 41800000 bushels and an average yield of 44 bushels 
per acre california 35640000 and 81 colorado 86950000 and 
37 georgia 19780000 and 43 idaho 56880000 and 72 illinois 
61600000 and 55 indiana 34300000 and 49 kansas 329000000

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo said 
thursday that the company is studying ways to restructure its 
troubled eastern airlines subsidiary but has no plans to sell the 
operation 
he did not offer any specifics of what changes might be in store 
for eastern which is saddled with bitter labor relations and 
recently passed a twomonth government safety investigation 
speaking at the companys annual meeting lorenzo told 
shareholders that despite the persistent labor agitation and 
financial troubles at the miamibased airline eastern airlines 
is not for sale 
but he placed a price tag of sorts on the airline by disclosing 
that a recent study by texas air found eastern had a netasset 
value of 2 billion or nearly 50 for each texas air share 
netasset value takes into account debts and liabilities and 
includes items such as aircraft and airport terminals 
several analysts declined to put their own estimates on 
easterns value but timothy pettee at the investment firm bear 
stearns amp co estimated easterns netasset value at closer to 
500 million 
stock in texas air which also owns houstonbased continental 
airlines was up 12 cents to 12 a share on the american stock 
exchange 
lorenzo who controls 34 percent of the voting power of texas 
air shares said management was looking at ways to improve 
shareholder values but declined to specify any actions under study 
however the company announced later thursday that the board had 
adopted an antitakeover plan aimed at making a hostile buyout 
prohibitively expensive under the plan texas air stockholders 
would be able to acquire for half price shares in any company that 
buys 25 percent or more of texas airs common stock and later 
acquires texas air or in any company that acquires more than 50 
percent of texas airs assets or earnings power 
the boardhas taken this step because among other things 
the common stock of the company is currently selling for a very low 
price in relation to to per share value of the assets of the 
company senior vice president charles t goolsbee said in a news 
release 
goolsbee said the plan was intended to encourage any bidders 
that might emerge to negotiate a fair price with the board 
together the texas air carriers have a debt of around 54 
billion the parent company posted a record aftertax loss of 466 
million in 1987 
lorenzo could be thinking of selling some of easterns aircraft 
and leasing them back pettee suggested he noted the carrier owns 
about 70 percent of its fleet well above the industry average of 
around 50 percent 
its basically the ace in the hole pettee said 
eastern president phil bakes told shareholders that eastern 
must be restructured and positioned for future profitability 
he said eastern management had cut about 200 million in annual 
costs and was striving mightily to resolve its problems with 
its unions 
eastern and texas air recently sued the pilots and machinists 
unions at eastern for 15 billion accusing them of eastern 
bashing and trying to drive down the value of the company 
eastern with a total work force of around 38000 announced 
layoffs of 3500 employees last november 
theres no love lost between labor and frank lorenzo said 
andrew geller an airline analyst for provident national bank in 
philadelphia 
by introducing the 2 billion figure geller suggested the 
texas air chief could have been floating a potential price tag for 
eastern as well as warning the carriers restive unions that he 
could sell it 
lorenzo presided over an often tense but generally controlled 
meeting threatening several times to have security guards eject 
shareholders and union members who continued their questioning 
after he had asked them to refrain 
a small group of protesters calling themselves abused passengers 
and employees against lorenzo demonstrated outside the meeting at 
chase manhattan banks headquarters 
lorenzo was flush from a victory earlier this week when a 
federal appeals court in washington lifted a ban on the sale of 
easterns northeast shuttle operations to another subsidiary of 
texas air 
a few days before that the federal aviation administration 
concluded after a twomonth investigation of eastern and 
continental that they are safe to fly 
the faa said however that the bitter labormanagement war at 
eastern raised possible safety risks if allowed to continue the 
agency said it would continue its surveillance of eastern 
continental president martin shugrue said he was pleased but 
not surprised that the faa had given continental a clean bill of 
health on safety 
he said continental was making substantial investments to 
improve its financial performance 
weve now completed the most complex integration in the 
history of the airline industry said shugrue a former vice 
chairman of pan am corp 
in recent years texas air has acquired continental eastern 
frontier people express and new york air the latter three were 
absorbed into continental

national broadcasting co said thursday it had 
decided against buying the cable channel tempo television for its 
proposed new business news service but plans to lease time on the 
channel for the program instead 
the company a unit of general electric co that owns the nbc 
television network announced last month it had signed a letter of 
intent to buy tempo television and would use it for new business 
news and sports programming 
the acquisition was seen as part of nbc president robert 
wrights oftstated plans to broaden the broadcasting concerns 
business base 
tempo television a unit of tempo enterprises inc of tulsa 
okla currently provides outdoors travel and informational 
programming to about 12 million subscribers 
nbc had planned to acquire the channel from telecommunications 
inc a denverbased cable operator which is in the process of 
buying tempo enterprises in a deal expected to close in the third 
quarter 
on thursday nbc and telecommunications said they were 
restructuring their plans to minimize tax and other complications 
that arose from trying to separate tempo television from its 
parent tempo enterprises 
under the new plan the companies said nbc would lease time on 
tempo television for a business news service that would run from 6 
am to 8 pm weekdays starting in early 1989 
under the new arrangement nbc will still own and manage the 
business news service but will reach existing tempo tv subscribers 
without actually purchasing tempo tv the announcement said 
it said that tempo television would try to help the business 
news service succeed by paying the first years affiliation fee on 
behalf of all current tempo tv affiliates who continue to carry 
tempo fulltime after the launch of the business news service 
john draper a spokesman for telecommunications said the new 
arrangement gives nbc the same thing that they were after when 
it planned to buy the cable channel access to a large base of 
subscribers 
he declined to specify how much nbc would pay for the lease it 
had been reported that nbc had agreed to pay about 20 million to 
buy the channel 
the statement did not indicate what the new plans were for 
introduction of the proposed sports programing that nbc previously 
said it would put on the cable channel 
john malone president of telecommunications said in the 
statement that his company will continue to explore with nbc the 
best format for sports and other possible programming for a prime 
time and weekend service 
a call was placed to nbc officials for elaboration on the 
statement but it was not returned 
wright was quoted in the statement as saying the cable 
industry has been very encouraging and we are enthusiastic about 
our plans going forward

the icc had given the subsidiary winona bridge railway co 
permission in november to reduce its crews on 1860 miles of bn 
track between seattle and winona junction minn 
burlington northern had planned a startup operation between 
seattle and spokane wash on may 31 
aspen also denied a counterpetition from bn to block threatened 
a strike by the unions if the railroad went ahead with its plans 
the united transportation union and the brotherhood of 
locomotive engineers said creation of the twomember crews was an 
unlawful attempt to circumvent the provisions of collective 
bargaining agreements 
under current union contracts burlington must maintain a crew 
consisting of an engineer a conductor and one or two brakemen 
in an effort to reduce its operating costs to compete with other 
motor and rail carriers burlington sought renegotiation of its 
union contracts to eliminate one brakeman from all crews and begin 
operating expediter trains with one engineer and one conductor 
last year the utu refused to go along with the request for 
trains operating between and within wisconsin and washington 
but the icc exempted the railroad from provisions of the railway 
labor act which requires mandatory bargaining when there is a 
unilateral change in working rules and conditions 
burlington northern however went ahead with plans to implement 
the twomember crews over the winona route and the unions 
threatened to strike if the railroad began the operations lawsuits 
from both sides followed 
we have no difficulty concluding that the dispute here between 
the utu and burlington regarding working conditions on trains 
agreement is a major dispute subject to the mandatory bargaining 
and status quo provisions of the rla aspen wrote 
the labor law first enacted by congress in 1926 sought to 
prevent crippling work stoppages that have plagued the railroad 
industry by forcing parties to resolve their differences through 
bargaining 
attorneys for bn and the union could not be reached thursday 
night to comment on the ruling the phone number for union lawyer 
joe prekop in cleveland went unanswered while a recorded message 
answered the telephone of bn attorney roger campbell

batus inc and farmers insurance group 
inc each claimed victory thursday over the interpretation of a 
proxy vote on batus 45 billion hostile takeover bid for the 
insurer 
farmers released the results of a shareholders vote on a 
resolution urging farmers management to negotiate with batus 
the vote cast at farmers annual meeting may 20 was 27821280 
in favor of the resolution 26809936 opposed and 2384384 shares 
abstentions 
batus said that with 51 percent of the votes cast the 
resolution passed 
farmers maintained however that its bylaws require a proposal 
to win approval of a majority of shares represented at the meeting 
for enactment that would require counting the abstentions in 
which case it said the resolution would fail with 49 percent 
the dispute began last week with the release of preliminary 
results of the vote which was tallied by corporation trust co of 
america in delaware 
we fully expect that farmers management will once again try to 
assert their preposterous claim that the resolution failed citing 
an irrelevant technicality in their bylaws said patrick sheehy 
chairman of louisvillebased batus a tobacco and retailing 
conglomerate 
their previous attempt to claim abstentions as votes for 
farmers management is an outright attempt to confuse their own 
shareholders abstain means just that those shares were not 
voted he said 
responded farmers spokesman tom welch if you count the way 
the bylaws say then the resolution failed 
batus a subsidiary of bat industries plc of britain has been 
pressing a 63ashare offer to farmers stockholders farmers 
management is vigorously opposing the bid both in mailings to 
stockholders and in hearings before insurance regulators in several 
states
