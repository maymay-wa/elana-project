as dusk settles on the treelined streets 
of chinas largest city the neon lights flicker cheerfully 
nationwide unrest has quieted but not silenced night life in 
shanghai famed for its songanddance halls allnight restaurants 
and cozy bars 
business slowed down a lot with all the confusion but now 
were back up around 80 percent of normal said a bartender at the 
white egret a 24hour pub and restaurant the problem was that 
with the traffic problems people couldnt get to work and they 
couldnt get here 
students and workers sympathetic to the prodemocracy movement in 
beijing staged their own massive protests after the military crushed 
demonstrations in the capital on june 34 
protesters in shanghai rolled public buses into major 
intersections and let the air out of tires they set up concrete 
roadblocks on other streets 
at their peak the disruptions kept an estimated 50 percent of 
shanghais 12 million residents away from their jobs 
that hurt places like the 5th avenue super bar a tiny spot down 
the street from the posh shanghai hilton 
do you see many customers here asked a hostess at the 5th 
avenue 
there was only one a man sitting in a dark cubicle with another 
hostess in his lap 
the first hostess said the man was a diplomat from one of the 
european consulates these days chinese are nervous and go 
straight home after work and foreigners have gone back to their 
countries she said 
the unrest frightened the foreign community and most expatriates 
left hurriedly after the crackdown in beijing fearing that troops 
would be called into shanghai next 
operators of night spots say foreigners are some of their best 
customers 
the 5th avenue super bar seemed to be trying to make up for lost 
revenue by soaking the few patrons it attracted the bill for a 
beer soda pop and plate of watermelon came to the equivalent of 
32 a months salary for many urban workers 
bartenders and managers say there are about 50 bars in shanghai 
most of which come to life about 6 pm and do not close until the 
wee hours of the morning their small quaint neon signs light up 
the darkness and hostesses with names like jenny and dolly pour 
drinks hold hands and stroke egos 
but even the popular ones arent full 
at the twostory napoleon a few couples sat quietly in 
highbacked chairs in the shadows while a handful of men gathered 
around the counters upstairs and downstairs

two cyclists who completed a 10day ride 
from california over the original pony express trail said they 
encountered many of the same problems that faced pony riders of 1860 
we still had to contend with the weather there were mud bogs 
where our cars got stuck hail storms and at one point we had to 
rebuild the road the elements havent changed said cyclist matt 
dewaal said 
i have great respect for the pony riders who rode month after 
month without so much as a hot shower he said 
dewaal and jay aldous arrived in st joseph at noon friday to 
complete a journey that started in sacramento calif aldous and 
dewaal both from salt lake city pedaled through a ribbon at the 
finish line in front of patee house museum the 1860 pony express 
headquarters 
it felt neat to cross the bridge into missouri and realize we 
were finally here aldous told the crowd of 200 who watched the 
arrival the pony express trail was about 1938 miles long but we 
rode 2041 miles with detours 
it was the first time bicyclists had traveled the original trail 
in the same 10day time covered by pony riders 129 years ago 
joe nardone trailmaster and pony express historian said aldous 
and dewaal managed to cover 400 miles of original pony express trail 
that remains almost untouched because of the rough and primitive 
terrain 
at one point they even had to help rebuild the trail road to 
get through nardone said their ride helped call attention to 
the pony express at a time when congress is considering whether to 
make the route a part of the national trails system 
the support crew made daily health checks of the riders and 
filmed a documentary of their trek which included camping at 
original stations as they crossing the dusty trail 
the ride was not the longest made by aldous and dewaal they set 
a world record in 1984 circling the globe by bicycle they covered 
14290 miles on four continents and 22 countries in 106 days

the reburial of imre nagy as a martyr 31 
years after his execution as a traitor illustrates the soviet blocs 
increasing tendency to discard official stalinist histories and 
accept events as they were 
encouraged by the soviet exposure of josef stalins excesses 
hungary and poland are confronting longavoided questions about the 
1956 uprising crushed by soviet tanks in the streets of budapest and 
the murder of polish officers by the soviets in the woods of katyn 
rewriting history has been common in the communist world since 
the bolshevik revolution of 1917 
rehabilitation is the term often used when honor is restored 
to former leaders disgraced or executed by ascendant rivals who 
often in their turn also fall from power 
although the current view of history is far more honest there 
still are elements of tailoring it to political ends 
in the soviet union mikhail s gorbachev has expressed 
disapproval of leonid i brezhnev but to some degree has 
rehabilitated nikita s khrushchev whom brezhnev discredited 
brezhnev now stands for the corrupt stagnant policies gorbachev 
seeks to change and khrushchev is seen as the forerunner of the 
reexamination of stalins dictatorship 
nikolai i bukharin and other old bolsheviks purged by stalin 
also have had their respectibility restored 
leon trotsky who commanded the red army in the civil war after 
1917 and lost the power struggle to stalin has not been 
rehabilitated but the kremlins view of him seems kinder trotsky 
was living in mexico in 1940 when an assassin sent by stalin killed 
him with an ax 
in the turbulence of the communist world rehabilitation 
sometimes is quick 
solidarity was born in poland in 1980 during a strike led by 
lech walesa and outlawed in 1982 walesa was detained for months 
and the independent union was reviled 
seven years later solidarity negotiated free elections with the 
government and the voters gave it a stunning victory 
when communist demigods die criticism can grow just as quickly 
president tito was unchallenged in yugoslavia from world war ii 
until his death in 1980 but his policies are being questioned nine 
years later and elaborate birthday festivities have been abandoned 
milovan djilas once heir apparent but later imprisoned by tito 
for nine years because of his dissident views has made a comeback 
after 36 years of being ostracized 
if titos reign had been shorter there would have been many 
fewer doubts cast on his merits djilas a successful writer said 
recently 
fridays reburial in hungary represented almost a complete 
reversal of political fortunes for nagy and janos kadar who took 
over after the soviets crushed the 1956 revolt 
kadar initially reviled gained respect in the 1960s for 
releasing many of those jailed in the revolt and for pursuing 
political and economic reform 
he put brakes on reform in the 1970s however and when he 
resigned last year had become a symbol of economic stagnation and 
political rigidity 
last month the central commmittee of the communist party 
criticized kadar while hailing nagy as a symbol of reform 
this week the government declared said it rejects the 
erroneous and indeed reprehensible political decisions of the past 
the reprisals that followed 1956 
czechoslovakia evidently worried that nagys reburial might draw 
attention to the case of alexander dubcek said thursday enemies 
of socialism might abuse the change in official sentiment 
dubcek was communist party chief in czechoslovakia during the 
prague spring of reform that was crushed by a sovietled 
invasion in august 1968 he now lives in relative obscurity

the government has confirmed the death of 
salet gaba an employee of the associated press for 20 years nearly 
two years after reporting his detention 
in an interview tuesday in the ndjamena information minister 
adoum moussa seif said gaba was killed by an army patrol in central 
guera province in 1987 the government alleges gaba was involved in 
an armed rebellion 
last december the londonbased human rights organization amnesty 
international said gaba was killed by security forces in a ndjamena 
prison sometime in mid1988 
previously the official radio and president hissene habre had 
said gaba was in prison awaiting trial on tuesday moussa seif 
denied the amnesty report but did not explain the contradiction 
between previous official statements and his new version of how gaba 
died 
amnesty international first reported that gaba who dropped out 
of sight in december 1986 fearing arrest was detained on july 14 
1987 in mongo capital of his home region of guera and was being 
held without charge in ndjamena 
the official chad radio the central african nations only 
station reported his detention in august 1987 but said gaba was 
arrested neither for his opposition to the regime of president 
hissene habre nor for his beliefs and even less for tribal 
reasons 
it said he was arrested after having been caught with weapons 
in his hands and because he is the author of the deaths of two 
peasants 
at a news conference during the frenchafrican summit in december 
1987 habre said gaba was captured in a state of rebellion and 
was to be tried for illegal possession of arms 
chad is a sparsely populated former french colony that has been

after a dominos pizza delivery car hit frank 
kranacks station wagon outside a suburban dominos store kranack 
said the manager rushed to the wreckage and demanded lets get 
this pizza on the road 
with all the damage there i just didnt believe he was worried 
about the pizza kranack said this week 
kranack 42 an accountant claimed whiplash injury in the 
october 1985 accident his wife mary jean 42 claimed neck and 
back injuries and says her right arm nearest the impact is 
permanently disabled 
the couples attorney kenneth r behrend filed a lawsuit for 
damages not against the 18yearold driver but against dominos 
pizza inc claiming in part that the company encourages dangerous 
driving with its trademark 30minute delivery guarantee 
people are being injured all over the country behrend said 
these drivers are trying to deliver pizzas within 30 minutes and 
sometimes its just not physically possible they may run a stop 
sign go over speed limits or make illegal turns 
dominos denies behrends charge says the company constantly 
reminds its drivers that safety is important and disqualifies 
delivery people with three or more serious moving violations 
behrend said he has gathered information on at least 30 serious 
accidents in recent years related to dominos speedy delivery 
ron hingst dominos spokesman at its ann arbor mich 
headquarters said the company knows of 20 fatalities involving 
dominos drivers pedestrians and others last year but that 
accidents are bound to happen in such a large fleet believed to be 
about 75000 to 80000 drivers 
jesse colson apparently was dominos most recent death this year 
colson 17 of plainfield ind a dominos driver working 18 
miles southwest of indianapolis was killed june 3 when his small 
pickup truck skidded on a rainslicked road and hit a utility pole 
his mother suzanne butros said he was speeding and called dominos 
guarantee an invitation to break the law 
ed kelley police chief in st petersburg beach fla said in 
1987 his department had to crack down on speeding dominos drivers 
when we catch them its going to be one driver to go kelley 
said at the time 
hingst said the dominos dominance of the homedelivery pizza 
business is based on its famous 29yearold promise to deliver pizza 
within 30 minutes of a telephone order 
last year dominos sold about 230 million pizzas delivering 
about 90 percent from about 5000 owned and franchised stores in 
the united states hingst said 
the company has grown from just 300 outlets in 1980 in part on 
its boast it would deliver the pizza for free if its drivers were 
late within a specified radius 
now hingst said dominos gives a 3 refund for a late pizza 
because some customers particularly college students deliberately 
gave imprecise directions just to get free food 
behrend and other lawyers are trading information about dominos 
and its delivery guarantee 
i want to see the 30minute guarantee stopped and my client 
wants it stopped behrend said 
hingst said said dominos works on speed in the store to get the 
pizzas out within 12 or 13 minutes after the order 
we emphasize hustle once they get to the store but once they 
get into the car there should be commonsense safe driving 
hingst said some people say were encouraging these kids to race 
but no were encouraging them to hustle theres a difference 
behrend charged some drivers are given as many as five pizzas to 
deliver within about 15 minutes 
thats rare hingst said 
he denied that dominos system in which mileage and tips 
supplement wages encourages recklessness 
we ask drivers to volunteer to their customers that the pizza 
is late and if theyre real courteous about it they may get a tip 
and it may be to their benefit hingst said he said the 3 refund 
comes from the store not the drivers pocket 
behrend said dominos encourages drivers to run to and from their 
cars and it awards its top driver an allexpensespaid trip to the 
indianapolis 500 where the company has a race car 
what is the mental attitude theyre encouraging the model of 
that race car sits in a lot of their stores encouraging the 
impression of a race car driver 
that will be a great story when its time to talk to a jury 
behrend said 
hingst said the indianapolis trip was discontinued four years 
ago he said a recent incentive program involving the opening of 
dominos 5000th store rewarded all drivers with at least 5000 safe 
driving hours

two bank robbers escaped during a 
shootout friday that left a police officer wounded and an accomplice 
dead 
a fourth man the getaway driver was arrested outside city 
national bank of hallandale after his car was riddled by police 
bullets one of the fugitives may also have been wounded police 
said 
police did not realize the men had escaped until a siege of 
several hours ended when a swat team dropped in from a helicopter 
and did not find anyone inside 
the robbers used a guards uniform to fool employees as they 
arrived at the bank in the morning they also seemed familiar with 
the banks operation police said 
it was well planned police chief richard fox said it 
takes some planning if this person had a security guards uniform 
on they apparently knew the routine it was not sloppy at all 
hallandale police lt david miles 42 a 16year veteran was in 
stable condition at hollywood memorial hospital with gunshot wounds 
to the cheek and the groin a hospital spokeswoman said 
miles new bulletproof vest which stopped the shot aimed at his 
groin probably saved his life said police sgt jack kudrick 
we understand he just started wearing one a week ago said 
city manager rj intindola hes lucky he did because he was shot 
at pointblank range 
the robbery attempt began just before 7 am fbi spokesman paul 
miller said when the phony guard let bank employees in and then tied 
them up 
a silent alarm was sounded as the robbers tried to force an 
employee to open the vault the banks vault was never opened 
authorities said 
as hallandale officer daniel oconnell 44 responded to the 
alarm he was disarmed and tied up 
that officer was followed by miles who exchanged shots with the 
suspects 
the officer who had been held hostage broke away and as he went 
out of the bank exchanged shots miller said four bank employees 
were able to walk out as they saw police arrive 
one robber identified only as a nicaraguan was felled in a hail 
of bullets as he fled the bank dying several feet from the getaway 
car 
the driver emerged unscathed even though the car windows were 
shot out and he was taken into custody pedro a sonarrida of 
hialeah was charged with firstdegree murder attempted homicide 
armed robbery and false imprisonment 
the murder charge stems from the death of his cohort during the 
commission of a felony 
officers surrounded the bank for what they assumed was a standoff 
with robbers inside shortly before 11 am a helicopter dropped 
six swat team members onto the banks roof but a search of the 
building turned up no suspects 
one witness said she saw one man jump on a bus when the shooting 
first broke out 
i saw three guys running this way one got killed one ran into 
a bus and the other i dont know where he went said carmen 
melgar 50 a hair stylist across the street who said she was nearly 
shot herself when a bullet shattered her window 
i feel so lucky like im born again she said 
the banks regular security guard is missing and police arent 
sure if he is in trouble relating to the foiled bank robbery

president bushs decision to offer protection 
to all chinese citizens in the united states has paved the way for 
at least two more chinese diplomats to obtain refuge here 
a state department official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said friday that besides the two chinese diplomats who announced in 
san francisco they intended to defect there have been additional 
chinese officials who have asked for protection in the united 
states 
he refused to give a specific number who have sought refuge nor 
to confirm a report that a husband and wife both diplomats in the 
chinese embassy in washington were the diplomats in question 
according to published and broadcast reports those two are han 
guohong secretary to the ambassador and her husband zhang chiwei 
an attache in the press office at the embassy in washington there 
was no one available for comment at the embassy early today 
the move to offer the additional chinese diplomats refuge came as 
more people were arrested in china for taking part in prodemocracy 
protests and chinas leaders increased efforts to absolve the 
government of the bloody attack on protesters in tiananmen square 
the official said the chinese diplomats who have asked for 
protection have not formally asked for asylum but could do so in 
the future 
he explained that the diplomats are covered under bushs decision 
to grant all chinese citizens in the united states permission to 
remain here until june 1990 
on monday zhou limin 26 a chinese vice consul in san 
francisco for cultural affairs and zhang limin 25 vice consul 
for overseas affairs announced plans to defect immigration 
officials said the two were in hiding after meeting with fbi and 
immigration authorities 
there are believed to be some 73000 chinese students in the 
united states as well as some 250000 visitors and business people 
who could be eligible under bushs offer 
chinese diplomats based in canada australia and japan are also 
reported to have sought refuge in those countries 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush deplores 
the persecutions of chinese who demonstrated for democracy but has 
no current plans to impose further sanctions or interruption of 
relations with china 
we continue to watch the situation said fitzwater well 
continue to measure it as we go forward sanctions are always a part 
of that review but we have nothing to announce 
bush has refused to affix blame for chinas bloodshed but has 
said it would be extraordinarily difficult for the united states 
to have normal relations with officials responsible for the massacre 
of students and workers participating in prodemocracy protests 
us officials repeatedly have stressed the importance of the 
relationship between the two countries and washingtons interest in 
retaining formal ties 
fitzwater declined to characterize bushs reaction to attempts by 
beijing officials to rewrite the story of the bloody massacre two 
weeks ago in beijings tiananmen square and claim that no 
demonstrators were killed 
but he said anyone who has seen the television reports knows what 
happened despite the chinese propaganda attempts 
those matters all speak for themselves the pictures and the 
reality of the reporting has been so dramatic that these kind of 
efforts stand beside them so starkly that i wouldnt even want to 
try to diminish that by giving it words fitzwater said

republican national chairman lee atwater has 
been handed a fresh vote of confidence from party leaders and a 
challenge from his democratic counterpart to move politics in this 
nation out of the gutter 
atwater under fire from democrats and critics within the gop for 
his roughandtumble style of politics was praised in a resolution 
friday by the partys national committee 
the committees resolution said atwaters aggressive stance has 
made him the target of unremitting attacks from democrats and 
their surrogates and he should keep it up 
the resolution neglected to mention the controversy surrounding a 
gop memo about the new house speaker thomas s foley the memo from 
atwaters office compared the voting record of the new house speaker 
with that of rep barney frank a liberal massachusetts democrat who 
has acknowledged being homosexual 
the memo bore the heading tom foley out of the liberal 
closet a play on the expression for acknowledging ones 
homosexuality 
the memo led to the resignation last week of an atwater aide 
mark goodin and caused an outcry from democrats atwater said he 
did not know about the memo until after it was sent out president 
bush said at the time he believed atwater and praised him for doing 
a great job 
it remained to senate republican leader bob dole to bring foleys 
name up from the platform for the first time in one of the closing 
speeches on friday 
dole reviewed the nomination battles in which supreme court 
nominee robert bork and defense secretarydesignate john tower were 
defeated and said we dont need any more smears of character 
that was the problem of robert bork of john tower and yes of 
tom foley he said 
i have had my differences with lee atwater dole told the 
republican group but the president has spoken and lee atwater is 
staying and he should and he is doing a good job 
house republican whip newt gingrich of georgia claimed in his 
speech that different standards are applied to liberals and 
conservatives in washington and that if you are a whistle blower 
in the conservative movement and the republican party there are no 
holds barred in trying to destroy you 
it was gingrich not then gop whip who first called for the 
ethics investigation of former speaker jim wright dtexas which 
led to the elevation of foley from majority leader 
in debate on the resolution jack london the gop national 
committeeman from arizona said the party chairman has the courage 
to do what all of us need to do 
in nashville tenn on friday democratic party chief ronald 
brown saying american politics is in trouble called for 
atwaters help in writing a campaign ethics code 
as chairmen of our respective parties we must resolve to move 
politics in this nation out of the gutter and up to a higher more 
noble level brown said at a meeting of the association of 
democratic chairs 
laying the blame squarely on republicans brown said bush must 
take charge because his troops are out of control 
the republican party leadership has become the princes of dirty 
politics dirty practices and negative campaigning brown said 
in response the gop committee issued a statement in which 
atwater said president bush will send congress a proposal on 
campaign reform very soon 
i will forward a copy of this proposal to ron brown for his 
review and if brown agrees with bushs proposal then we may 
indeed have a need to sit down and discuss the issue 
the gop statement said atwater also hoped brown would agree to 
discuss uniform criteria to insure that the nationwide 1991 
redistricting of congressional and legislative districts is done in 
a fair ethical and open manner

women who choose against nursing their newborn 
children may have to get along without hormones and drugs that 
prevent painful breast engorgement 
the food and drug administration says it will ask drug companies 
to stop promoting these hormones and drugs for nonnursing mothers 
because they are no more effective than mild analgesics or breast 
supports and may do harm 
fda officials plan to meet soon with drug companies about getting 
them to agree to stop marketing the medicines for that purpose 
im sure well agree to ask the companies to comply with the 
recommendations of the committee philip a corfman executive 
secretary of the advisory committee and fdas supervisory medical 
officer for fertility and maternal health drugs said friday 
the issue is how much further we wish to go in the matter to 
get them to comply he said the fda could withdraw approval for 
use of the suppressants for breast engorgement he said 
the public citizen health research group says use of the hormones 
and drugs needlessly exposes more than 700000 new mothers to health 
risks jennifer r niebyl a physician on the fda committee said the 
pain is significant for only 10 percent of the women who get the 
drug 
corfman said the estrogen and androgen hormones and their 
combinations have been shown to raise the risk of blood clots 
bromocriptine is associated with a small number of seizures 
strokes and heart attacks he said 
the drug is made by sandoz pharmaceuticals corp of east hanover 
nj and sold under the name parlodel 
david l winter a spokesman for sandoz said studies have found 
no provable connection between bromociptine and the adverse 
effects corfman cited 
we believe its an issue of choice as to whether a woman 
chooses to take a pharmacologic approach winter said 
the company agrees the drug should not be used as a routine 
therapy for nonnursing mothers he said however we feel there 
is a subset of women who for many different reasons cannot or choose 
not to breastfeed should have the options explained to them 
including the use of bromocriptine he said 
more than 4 million women have used bromocriptine in the nine 
years it has been on the market and few adverse effects have been 
reported winter said 
he said the fda has not contacted the company 
the advisory group addressed only the use of hormones and the 
drug bromocriptine to stop milk production in nonnursing mothers 
bromocriptine for which lactation suppression is the major use and 
the hormones have several other approved uses and those other 
approvals would not be affected by withdrawal of fda approval for 
lactation suppression

jeff mayer bills himself as the most expensive 
maid in the nation business executives actually pay him 1000 to 
tell them how to clean off their cluttered desks 
i go into an office and it looks like the desk was in the spin 
cycle of a washing machine says the 39yearold mayer and when 
were done its like the flight deck of a aircraft carrier 
over the past five years mayer says his oneman company mayer 
enterprises has done this job on 700 executives in the chicago 
area he has gathered enough theories and techniques about office 
organization to fill a book so hes writing one 
but are his lessons worth 1000 
barry wolf owner of communications research amp development in 
chicago swears his money was well spent 
about three years ago i realized my office was just piled high 
and very disorganized and time was getting tighter and tighter 
said wolf so out of the blue he calls and says how would you 
like to get your time more organized 
so he got my life organized wolf recalled and my office 
is still as neat as a tack 
wolf said executives face the same problem a limited amount of 
time to get a lot of work done 
if 1000 buys you an hour a day and you can make money during 
that hour you bet it pays said wolf 
mayers formula for clutterbusting is simple executives pay 
attention and save 1000 
he has the executives make a master list of things to do an 
inventory of all unfinished work he does it by sorting through the 
papers piled on a desk one by one if the paper needs to be saved it 
goes into a file otherwise it gets pitched 
stacks of papers represent wasted time and wasted money to mayer 
if you ask them about it they say if they see it theyll 
remember to do it but it gets buried and they dont see it 
anyhow said mayer in an interview earlier this week 
he meets with the executives for two sessions of two hours each 
at the end of two hours theres a list one or two pages long 
a handful of file folders weve made and theres probably two 
garbage cans filled with junk said mayer 
patricia wier president of encyclopaedia britannica concedes 
she had doubts when she hired mayer but concluded his techniques 
really do work 
she said his system was so simple she should have thought of it 
herself 
but the fact is i didnt she said i was so impressed i 
sent him to four or five other executives in the company

the department of housing and urban 
developments chief watchdog says the agency ignored his 
recommendations for safeguards against the theft of money from the 
sale of foreclosed property with governmentinsured mortgages 
testifying friday before a house subcommittee inspector general 
paul adams also said the accounts of at least a dozen private agents 
in huds property sales program nationwide were being examined for 
possible misappropriation fraud and embezzlement 
one of the agents nicknamed robin hud because she said she 
gave most of her proceeds to the poor tearfully admitted in 
fridays hearing that she stole 5 million in funds due the 
government 
quoting scripture and claiming she followed a higher law 
mary louise harrell told the house subcommittee on housing and 
employment i have come forward as one who loves the lord in an 
attempt to confess to the world that i diverted government funds 
adams told the subcommittee he had repeatedly warned top agency 
officials including former hud secretary samuel pierce that the 
system for monitoring money from property sales was weak 
investigators are trying to track down 20 million from those sales 
hud has not established effective monitoring systems to assure 
that closing agents properly carry out their responsibilities 
adams said 
moreover planned changes to its automated systems have been 
slow and current systems do not contain all information field 
offices need to properly monitor agent activities he added 
but the inspector general came under fire from lawmakers for 
doing nothing when his warnings and recommendations were ignored 
it looks to me like you just covered your rear end because you 
told them said rep christopher shays rconn 
its your job to make sure this doesnt happen he said 
meanwhile the wall street journal said top officials in the 
reagan administrations department of housing and urban development 
overruled staff objections and awarded a 268000 grant to a company 
run by republican fundraiser frederick bush 
bush amp co subcontracted the technical work for the project an 
economic development plan for puerto rico to another firm for 
125000 and took the rest of the grant according to hud records 
obtained by the newspaper 
bush was deputy finance chairman for thenvice president george 
bushs presidential campaign last year and is now the nominee for 
ambassador to luxembourg he is no relation to president bush 
a hud official said friday the details of the journal story were 
absolutely correct

former national security adviser john 
poindexter has become the second defendant in the irancontra 
scandal to try to put president bush and former president reagan on 
the witness stand 
defense attorney richard beckler said friday that bush and reagan 
have information relevant to the criminal charges against poindexter 
the same effort to subpoena bush and reagan was made in the trial 
of former white house aide oliver north but us district court 
judge gerhard gesell quashed the subpoenas 
gesell said there was no proof north received authorization from 
reagan to engage in illegal conduct and he said north failed to 
demonstrate that bush who was reagans vice president had any 
relevant information 
poindexter unlike north met daily with reagan and so may have 
more solid legal grounds for asking the former president to testify 
in other legal action friday prosecutors said they will seek to 
narrow the scope of criminal charges against poindexter 
associate independent counsel christian mixter told us district 
court judge harold greene that after the charges are narrowed 
there would be no reason to involve bush and reagan in the trial 
prosecutors want to cut the size of the poindexter case in an 
attempt to avoid the kind of protracted legal battle over classified 
information that nearly derailed the north trial 
to be abandoned will be portions of a conspiracy count that delve 
into the diversion of iran arms sale money to the contra rebels 
trying to overthrow the leftist government in nicaragua 
the remaining four counts against poindexter accuse him of 
obstructing and making false statements to congress in connection 
with norths secret resupply operation for the contras and a 1985 
arms shipment to iran 
prosecutors also moved to dismiss farreaching conspiracy and 
theft charges against irancontra figure richard secord 
secord was enlisted by north to run arms to the contras during a 
congressional ban on military aid to the rebels 
in court papers independent counsel lawrence walsh said he 
wished to avoid the same legal fight over state secrets that loomed 
in the poindexter case federal agencies are reluctant to give 
secord access to classified documents to prepare his defense 
secord is also charged with conspiring to pay an illegal gratuity 
to north by arranging to set up a 200000 swiss bank account for 
his children and by financing installation of a 13800 security 
system outside norths suburban virginia home 
secord also faces charges of lying to the 1987 congressional 
hearings on the irancontra affair

a group of 40 congressmen are asking the bush 
administration to investigate a japanese monks claims that he 
shared a prison cell with three captive american soldiers and had 
seen as many as 10 american prisoners while in vietnam 
in a letter sent friday to president bush and secretary of state 
james a baker iii the congressmen urged a thorough investigation 
of this recent account of american pows in vietnam 
iwanobu yoshida a 65yearold buddhist monk imprisoned for 14 
years before his release in january is being treated in a sapporo 
hospital on the island of hokkaido for physical and mental disorders 
stemming from his imprisonment his daughter keiko takatsuka has 
been interpreting for him because he suffers from a speech 
impediment 
every resource available should be used to determine the fate 
of our pows and mias in vietnam the letter from the congressmen 
said we ask you to do all that you can to bring an end to this 
uncertainty 
rep james saxton rnj said we have been informed that a 
us military attache interviewed the monk a few days ago 
however the administration has elected not to disclose any 
information from the meeting at this time 
lisa zywokarte a saxton aide said officials with the state 
department confirmed that the united states plans to send another 
military attache to meet with yoshida the first meeting was monday 
yoshida said he recalled seeing young and healthy americans 
in the prison but could not remember their names 
the vietnamese embassy in tokyo has denied yoshindas claims 
saying hanoi holds no prisoners from the war that ended in 1975 
however the us government has been pressing for information on 
the 2364 americans listed as missing in action 
yoshida became a monk in 1966 leaving his family behind when he 
emigrated to vietnam to set up a temple in saigon he became a south 
vietnamese citizen in 1973 and was arrested in 1975 after north 
vietnamese forces took control of south vietnam international human 
rights groups secured his release on jan 20

baniyas israeliannexed golan heights ap us and israeli 
archaeologists have unearthed a roman metropolis that in its heyday 
was the ancient worlds equivalent of new york 
founded in about ad 10 by herod philip son of king herod the 
great ancient baniyas grew over the next several hundred years 
into a huge city archaeologist vassilios tzarferis of the 
israel antiquities department recently said 
we can estimate the population in roman times of up to 15000 
people which for those days means it was a new york tzarferis 
said 
traces of ruined villas can be found a mile from the city center 
he said 
herod philip chose the site near the source waters of the jordan 
river and next to a cave where pagans worshiped pan the goatlike 
god of the shepherds the cave is part of a national park that today 
is a favorite site for picnics 
he named his city in honor of emperor augustus caesar but it 
became known as caesarea philipi to distinguish it from the port of 
caesarea constructed by his father on the mediterranean sea 
american teams working at the site this year have partially 
uncovered a dozen 30foothigh arches that formed one side of what 
appears to be a long shopping mall said john wilson an archaeology 
professor from pepperdine college in southern california 
the arches now are the bottom layer of a wedding cake of history 
wilson said crusader conquerers 1000 years later built a citadel on 
top in the 13th or 14th century mameluke raiders from egypt added a 
palace 
on top of it all was a syrian village wilson said baniyas 
was part of syria until the golan heights region was taken by israel 
in the 1967 middle east war and annexed in 1981 
diggers have uncovered a public gate dating to the 1st century 
and a 2nd or 3rd century house with mosaic floors one of which is 
largely intact 
wilson said we are encouraged there may be considerable 
sections of ancient baniyas that are preserved but he estimated 
it would take up to 10 years with as many as 100 people working each 
digging season to expose a substantial part of the city 
historians and archeologists had many clues to the citys 
location wilson said 
the pan cave with niches and inscriptions appears exactly on 
coins of the 2nd and early 3rd century that say they are from 
baniyas wilson said there are other coins with pictures of 
buildings which we feel are as accurate and thats what were 
looking for 
the area is referred to as paneon by the jewish historian 
josephus who says herod the great built a white stone temple to 
roman emperor augustus there 
for years it was strategically important because it controlled 
the road from damascus to the sea wilson said it lost its 
importance after ottoman turks took control he said 
in addition to pepperdine the other american colleges that sent 
students to work at baniyas this year were averett college of 
danville va and hardinsimmons university and abilene christian 
college both of abilene texas

despite tension over japanese market barriers 
and the us trade deficit some major us companies are doing well 
in japan and expect to prosper there through the rest of the 
century says the president of the american chamber of commerce in 
japan 
the us company international business machines is the largest 
single exporter of computers from japan while the largest 
restaurant company in japan is macdonalds and the largest beverage 
company is cocacola japan accounting for between 25 and 50 
percent of the us parent companys worldwide profit last year 
said chamber president william e franklin 
he told reporters friday his own company kodak has opened a 
100 million research center in yokohama in anticipation of more 
business 
america was the no 1 foreign investor in japan over the last 
five years with an average annual return of 20 percent said 
franklin who was attending the annual washington gathering of us 
chamber of commerce executives based in asia and the pacific 
he said it could help improve our trade problems by focusing on 
some of these success stories and if other companies knew that some 
companies do very well in japan and i think will continue to do 
well between now and the end of the century 
americans should not lose sight of the enormous progress 
represented by a huge increase in one year of onethird more 
japanese imports from the united states and removal of most of 
japans import tariffs franklin said 
japans average tariff is down to 2 percent the lowest of any 
advanced country he said adding now there needs to be great 
urgency to remove nontariff barriers figuring in the continuing 
trade conflict a major such barrier he said is the monopoly over 
domestic markets by existing japanese companies creating entry 
problems for newcomers japanese or foreign 
the two countries are currently discussing the structural 
background of the trade imbalance which some economists say plays a 
bigger role than market access structural problems include exchange 
rates and distribution systems low japanese consumption and high 
savings and high us debt and low us savings and investment 
franklin did not take issue with the us governments action 
under the new super 301 trade law last month designating 
japanese restrictions on imports of lumber supercomputers and 
satellites as unfair trade to be subjected to investigation 
negotiation and possible us retaliation 
congress reflects public attitudes he said and given what i 
perceive to be the feeling of congress nothing could have been done 
to avoid japan being named after the law passed 
the united states had a 55 million trade deficit with japan last 
year described as intolerable and unsustainable by us government 
officials and members of congress

a second maker of inexpensive highalcohol 
wines is pulling the product from stores shelves in the citys seedy 
tenderloin district although some people doubt the move will curb 
alcoholism 
the manufacturer of richards wild irish rose on friday announced 
it was joining eampj gallo in removing cheap wine from the 
neighborhoods stores gallo said wednesday it would stop selling 
such brands as thunderbird and night train express to retailers in 
the tenderloin san franciscos skid row for six months 
the action came after area distributer gallobay cities owned by 
gallo met with a group dubbed safe and sober streets that has asked 
grocers to stop selling such wines in the neighborhood 
the group says it is tired of tripping over wine bottles and 
being menaced by drunks 
thunderbird night train express and richards wild irish rose 
are three of the bestselling brands of fortified wines which are 
18 percent alcohol regular wine is about 12 percent 
on friday the canandaigua wine co maker of richards wild 
irish rose said the company would no longer sell that brand in the 
tenderloin 
given our companys position and the specifics of this 
situation we will participate in this program and discontinue 
distribution in this area the canandaigua nybased company 
said 
the statement read by a secretary who would not give her name 
did not say how long the program would last 
the highalcohol wines are typically made from the cheapest 
ingredients then mixed with grape brandy to increase the alcoholic 
content they sell for about 90 cents to 125 a bottle typically a 
fifth of a gallon 
after i got the news from gallo i ordered 250 cases of wild 
irish rose hatim nassar owner of empire liquor and grocery said 
friday 
nassar said he is worried that the gallo pullout will last longer 
than six months he said he has stocked up on a sixmonth supply of 
the gallo brands and raised the price of each bottle 25 cents 
this is my bread and butter said nassar who estimated he 
sells about 200 bottles of the cheap wines each day if i dont 
continue to sell this i will have to close my doors and go home 
liquor store owner peter wong said he isnt concerned some 
were sorry to see it go but theres other comparable brands 
people can buy he said 
some of the tenderloins harddrinking crowd hangs out at 
boedeker park where the homeless sleep on the lawn and the smell of 
urine permeates the air 
they said the disappearance of the cheap wines wont reduce 
alcoholism in the area 
they gonna chip in their money and buy a big expensive 
bottle said one man who refused to give his name you aint 
gonna stop a drinking man from drinking if they dont drink in the 
morning they gonna have a seizure 
allen keys 37 who said he goes to the park twice a week to play 
ball and hang around maintained that the districts denizens simply 
will walk to another neighborhood go to another store and bring 
cheap wine back 
modestobased gallo has said if the experiment succeeds in 
reducing alcoholism in the tenderloin the company will pull those 
wines in other neighborhoods 
police officer bob geary who patrols the park said the 
manufacturers decision against selling to neighborhood retailers is 
a stopgap measure and an oversimplification of the problem 
he said he issues about 11 alcoholrelated citations in the park 
each day 
i understand what the community is trying to do but i still 
feel that everyone in the free enterprise system has the right to 
sell legal goods he said it would be more effective to have 
closer policing of the selling of goods to intoxicants and 
youngsters

the justice department has objected to georgia 
laws that had created two judicial circuits and 48 elected superior 
court judgeships over the past 24 years 
the action was disclosed in a letter to state officials from 
james p turner an acting assistant attorney general in the civil 
rights division under the 1965 civil rights act the objection 
renders the laws legally unenforceable until the departments 
objection is withdrawn or overturned in court 
but deborah burstionwade a spokeswoman for the civil rights 
division said friday the departments objection does not prevent 
the 48 sitting judges from continuing to fulfill their duties nor 
does it provide a basis for challenging their past decisions 
the voting rights act requires that georgia and other southern 
states submit all voting or election changes to the justice 
department which must determine that the changes have neither a 
racially discriminatory purpose nor effect before they can take 
effect 
the 48 judgeships covered by the departments objection friday 
out of 137 total superior court judgeships in the state all were 
created since passage of the voting rights act

five of the original seven mercury 
astronauts marked the 30th anniversary of the launching of the 
nations manned space program with a plea to save earth 
scott carpenter said on friday that the soviet union has moved 
ahead of the united states in space exploration but added maybe 
thats ok 
he said the world is being united by a common foe the health 
of this planet we no longer should think about spending money to go 
to mars we need to make this planet one that will flourish 
that he said has more priority in my view than beating the 
soviets to mars 
wally schirra suggested that countries work together on a space 
station and satellites that could observe things such as weather 
patterns in a project he called mission to planet earth 
weve definitely got to get concerned about spaceship earth 
he said its where we live we dont need to go to mars just 
yet 
carpenter and schirra were joined by alan shepard gordon cooper 
and donald deke slayton at a news conference at the university 
of north carolinas morehead planetarium to celebrate several 
anniversaries including next months 20th anniversary of the first 
moon landing 
this year also marks the 30th anniversary of their becoming the 
nations first astronauts and the start of the us manned space 
program 
sen john glenn dohio was unable to attend events friday but 
was expected to join the group today virgil gus grissom one of 
the original seven astronauts was killed jan 27 1967 in a fire 
aboard apollo i 
the mercury space program consisted of six flights from 1961 to 
1963 including the first us manned flight with shepard in 1961 
and the first us manned orbital flight with glenn in 1962 
the seven astronauts trained at the planetarium beginning in 
february 1960 
since i spent the least amount of time here i was the fastest 
learner shepard said 
the astronauts also were having their annual reunion to raise 
money for the mercury seven foundation which they founded as a 
scholarship program for college students interested in careers in 
scientific or engineering fields 
the training at the planetarium was important shepard said 
because no one really knew what to expect in space in those days 
said slayton in the mercury program everything was a total 
unknown 
tony jenzano then director of the planetarium recalled the 
programs start when officials didnt want more than two astronauts 
together and didnt want them to congregate in one place 
but there was a terrible sporadic snowstorm that trapped them 
here for five to six days he recalled 
in all 65 astronauts trained at the planetarium ending with 
slayton in 1973 
slayton was one of the original seven mercury astronauts but was 
grounded because of a heart problem in 1962 he returned to flight 
status 10 years later and went into space in 1975 with the 
apollosoyuz project that was the first meeting in space between 
us astronauts and soviet cosmonauts 
the space program has changed much since the days of space 
capsules and moved into the day of space shuttles but despite the 
romanticism often associated with space schirra said flights can 
often be boring 
when you spend 24 hours a day in orbit theres not a lot you 
can do he said 
slayton said interest in the space program has diminished since 
it moved away from interplanetary flight 
landing on the moon is a very tough act to follow theres only 
one moon and you can land on it first only once he said

despite tension over japanese market barriers 
and the us trade deficit some major us companies are doing well 
in japan and expect to prosper there through the rest of the 
century says the president of the american chamber of commerce in 
japan 
the us company international business machines is the largest 
single exporter of computers from japan while the largest 
restaurant company in japan is mcdonalds and the largest beverage 
company is cocacola japan accounting for between 25 and 50 
percent of the us parent companys worldwide profit last year 
said chamber president william e franklin 
he told reporters friday his own company kodak has opened a 
100 million research center in yokohama in anticipation of more 
business 
america was the no 1 foreign investor in japan over the last 
five years with an average annual return of 20 percent said 
franklin who was attending the annual washington gathering of us 
chamber of commerce executives based in asia and the pacific 
he said it could help improve our trade problems by focusing on 
some of these success stories and if other companies knew that some 
companies do very well in japan and i think will continue to do 
well between now and the end of the century 
americans should not lose sight of the enormous progress 
represented by a huge increase in one year of onethird more 
japanese imports from the united states and removal of most of 
japans import tariffs franklin said 
japans average tariff is down to 2 percent the lowest of any 
advanced country he said adding now there needs to be great 
urgency to remove nontariff barriers figuring in the continuing 
trade conflict a major such barrier he said is the monopoly over 
domestic markets by existing japanese companies creating entry 
problems for newcomers japanese or foreign 
the two countries are currently discussing the structural 
background of the trade imbalance which some economists say plays a 
bigger role than market access structural problems include exchange 
rates and distribution systems low japanese consumption and high 
savings and high us debt and low us savings and investment 
franklin did not take issue with the us governments action 
under the new super 301 trade law last month designating 
japanese restrictions on imports of lumber supercomputers and 
satellites as unfair trade to be subjected to investigation 
negotiation and possible us retaliation 
congress reflects public attitudes he said and given what i 
perceive to be the feeling of congress nothing could have been done 
to avoid japan being named after the law passed 
the united states had a 55 billion trade deficit with japan last 
year described as intolerable and unsustainable by us government 
officials and members of congress

after 12 weeks of shelling by syrian 
forces this oncebustling christian enclave north of beirut has 
become a ghost town 
the daily artillery fire which drove most of its 1 million 
residents into underground bunkers and shelters has sapped the life 
from an area once called the monte carlo of the middle east 
although the intensity of shellfire has eased since the arab 
league called for a ceasefire may 11 the christians outnumbered 
and outgunned by syria and its allies have been paralyzed by an 
acute gasoline shortage 
if its not shelling its gas and if its not gas its 
something else said samira khater a secretary 
there is hardly any traffic on the roads few people are able to 
drive to work 
half the shops hidden behind sandbags and earthfilled oildrums 
are shuttered 
factories that survived the ferocious shelling limp along with 
skeleton staffs and whatever fuel they can scrounge 
restaurants are lucky if they get 10 customers a day 
and the night life that once throbbed in the clubs bars and 
restaurants along the mediterranean coastline is dead 
closed is the famous casino du liban overlooking jounieh bay 12 
miles north of beirut where oilrich sheiks from the persian gulf 
and highrollers from around the world once gambled 
it was a regular target for the syrian gunners who have battled 
the forces of christian leader gen michel aoun since march 8 in 
some of the most savage artillery and rocket battles of lebanons 
14year civil war 
about 360 people have been killed and nearly 1400 wounded 
mostly civilians 
the christians are tired and dispirited struggling to cope with 
a grim fatalism 
the ceasefire violated daily by the syrians had raised 
peoples hopes they would be able to pick up the pieces of their 
shattered lives and find some semblance of normality 
instead theres a stillness punctuated only by the periodic 
crump of exploding shells 
the syrians maintain their blockade of the christian enclave 
ringed on its landward sides by hostile moslem forces 
small cargo ships run the gauntlet of shellfire to bring in food 
and ammunition for the besieged christians until a few days ago 
the blockade runners didnt try bringing in gas 
it only takes one hit to blow up a ship loaded with fuel a 
police spokesman said so no one dares take the risk 
one small tanker the 1507ton chemicoral made a run thursday 
with 660000 gallons of gasoline but it was hit by syrian shellfire 
and its cargo burned 
others than gas there are no real shortages thanks to the 
blockade runners 
supermarkets bulge with imported goods pink chamapagne passion 
fruit tea whisky cookies chocolates hams cheeses 
fruit and vegetables are in short supply but available for a 
price before the fighting most produce came from syriancontrolled 
areas now theyre smuggled in at night by muletrain from the north 
the enclaves fuel reserves went up in flames when a syrian 
barrage blew up the seaside dora depot in east beirut two months ago 
the french lebanons colonial rulers until 1943 and the 
christians traditional protector shipped in 4000 tons of fuel to 
reactivate shutdown power plants a few weeks ago 
theres so little gasoline around that only about onefifth of 
the filling stations bother to open 
police said two people have been killed and 10 wounded in 
gunfights over gas 
people have to wait for days in front of the stations and all 
they get in the end is 10 liters 225 gallons one attendant 
said 
a halftank at filling stations costs 50 a months wages for 
many lebanese 
one motorist noted filling station owners pump out the gas 
from their tanks and sell it on the black market for 10 times the 
price 
long lines of cars some extending a mile stand outside many 
filling stations 
at first everyone used to wait for days in their cars even 
during the shelling grocer samir madi said now we take it in 
turns to wait for a station to open 
when it does whoevers keeping vigil telephones everyone else 
and they all rush to the station 
bank clerk samar moallem who earns 60 a month hasnt gone to 
work for weeks 
i dont have any gas she said i cant afford to pay my 
whole salary for 20 liters or pay 2 a day for taxis getting to 
and from work i told the bank if they want me theyll have to get 
me gas

the us catholic catholic church is 
trying to heal the wounds left by the vietnam war but some bishops 
fear support of renewed relations with vietnam may grant legitimacy 
to its communist government 
the national conference of catholic bishops was scheduled to vote 
today on a proposal for normalizing relations with vietnam 
the committee on international policy of the united states 
catholic conference is recommending the church support the proposal 
the annual spring meeting of the nations bishops opened friday at 
seton hall university with debate on the proposal by the committee 
which visited with vietnamese bishops in january 
archbishop roger m mahony committee chairman said the 
committee did not seek to express approval of the vietnamese regime 
but to work for improved relations that could lead to increased 
humanitarian assistance and a more effective forum for expressing 
concerns over violations of human rights and religious liberty 
but some bishops said vietnamese americans are concerned the 
church is granting legitimacy to a barbaric regime in return for 
vague promises 
bishop joseph j madera of fresno calif said the brother of a 
priest in his diocese has spent 30 years in a vietnamese prison 
we have to hear not just the bishops of vietnam but also the 
people who are affected in their daily lives he said 
also friday the conference president declared relations have 
never been better in recent years between the vatican and the church 
in the united states 
i believe that the bridge between rome and the united states is 
stronger than it has been in recent memory said archbishop john 
l may of st louis 
archbishop pio laghi the apostolic pronuncio who is the popes 
representative in the united states agreed with may 
now we have a very good relationship laghi said there is 
a beautiful atmosphere now very warm 
may said after his talk that a lot of eyes and a lot of ears 
have been opened in rome following a series of encounters with us 
bishops including the popes visit in 1987 meetings with 
individual bishops last year and a march meeting of cardinals and 
archbishops with vatican officials 
other bishops agreed there is a new era in relations with the 
vatican 
we all learned from our experiences said cardinal joseph 
bernardin of chicago who helped resolve a dispute involving seattle 
archbishop raymond hunthausen who was unilaterally stripped by the 
vatican of some of his ecclesial authority for alleged doctrinal 
abuses most of his authority was later restored after us bishops 
intervened 
in a test of their new relationship the bishops were scheduled 
to vote today on a document that proposes ways to resolve disputes 
between bishops and theologians the proposal from the bishops 
committee on doctrine has been criticized by the vatican for 
appearing to place bishops and theologians on equal levels 
in march the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in rome 
said the proposed document on doctrinal responsibilities which 
advocates the rights of theologians to lawful freedom of inquiry 
and expression of scholarly opinion tends logically to the 
erection of a second teaching authority in the church 
today the committee of bishops was also to present a progress 
report on an aids policy that will be debated and voted on at a 
future conference it had been planned months ago to present the 
report and open it up to debate and a possible vote at the seton 
hall conference said the rev kenneth doyle spokesman for the 
conference 
he said however that the report was not far enough along to be 
debated and the report would consist only of an estimated timetable 
for its completion

the energy department plans to commit 18 million 
a year to improve monitoring of the troubled rocky flats plutonium 
plant and to purchase 730000 worth of monitoring equipment 
the federal government also assured gov roy romer on friday that 
the state will be able to independently monitor activity at the 
plant which is under investigation for safety violations 
the promise was part of an agreement reached by energy department 
deputy director henson moore and romer following the governors 
threat last week to shut down the plant 
at a news conference moore and romer announced the agreement 
which must be ratified by energy secretary james watkins 
we are going to operate on the basis that people need to know 
the truth and we are going to get it to them in a way in which it 
is verified independently of the operation of the plant romer 
said my policy has been weve got to clean it up or close it 
down 
rocky flats located 16 miles northwest of denver manufactures 
plutonium detonators for nuclear bombs rockwell international 
operates the plant for the energy department 
on june 6 scores of fbi agents and environmental protection 
agency investigators raided the plant looking for evidence of 
illegal dumping and incineration of hazardous wastes 
the onsite investigation continued friday 
under fridays agreement the energy department will provide 
additional technical and financial support for state environmental 
oversight monitoring repair emergency response and healthrelated 
initiatives 
the department said it will accelerate cleanup where 
contamination presents a threat it also will monitor surface waters 
and treated drinking water streams entering reservoirs samples of 
discharges and underground water under the agreement 
moore said the bush administration wants to send the message that 
environment safety and health is not any longer a factor it 
is the first priority in the operation of any of our facilities 
the department will consent to penalties if we dont live up to 
the agreement with the governors office said moore 
asked about the departments historical lack of candor about 
reporting incidents at the plant moore snapped at a reporter i 
dont lie to people fella not to you not to him the governor 
not to anybody else you just watch what we do 
he said if rockwell cannot assure the plant is being run in a 
safe manner then they are not to produce he said 
sam f iacobellis president of rockwell international aerospace 
operations hailed the agreement we have long urged similar 
actions and fully support the governors initiative he said 
he also denied allegations in an fbi affidavit that rocky flats 
illegally operated an incinerator at night in a building closed by 
energy department inspectors iacobellis also said there was no 
deliberate midnight dumping of wastes at rocky flats 
energy department officials said friday that new tests show 
drinking water in northwest metropolitan denver is uncontaminated by 
chemicals the fbi suspects were dumped into creeks at rocky flats 
some of the creeks empty into reservoirs used as municipal water 
supplies 
romer earlier threatened to close the plant unless the department 
stepped up its environmental monitoring at the site and made the 
results available to him

communist rebels shadowed nine us 
servicemen assigned to clark air base last year apparently in 
preparation for an assassination attempt it was reported today 
the pacific stars and stripes an unofficial us military 
newspaper quoted filipino authorities in angeles city as saying 
they learned of the surveillance through documents captured last 
july from the communist new peoples army 
according to the report the rebels watched two us air force 
colonels a lieutenant colonel four captains and two sergeants 
assigned to the base in angeles city 
the newspaper quoted police maj efren alamares as saying the 
nine were apparently targeted because they lived off post

manila suburb of quezon city 
in october 1987 rebels killed three americans and a filipino

comment on them and we do this to protect individuals who may be 
involved 
she refused to say whether the nine personnel are still assigned 
to clark or to describe their duties

a northern minnesota county is 
withdrawing its offer of free land to wouldbe homesteaders because 
of complaints from longtime residents and legal and financial snags 
commissioners of koochiching county decided this week to stop 
taking applications for land after sept 1 almost three years 
earlier than planned 
it hasnt been a failure at all said commissioner larry 
chezick i just dont think we ever had visions of how the media 
would portray this 
the rural county along the canadian border began the program two 
years ago hoping that up to 40 acres of free land would attract 
modernday pioneers and offset declines in population school 
enrollment and the local economy 
it is believed to be the first such landgiveaway since the 19th 
century federal homesteading program that populated much of the 
nation and it attracted intense coverage from newspapers magazines 
and television stations around the globe that didnt want to miss a 
onceinacentury story 
in the wake of the publicity whirlwind more than 10000 people 
asked for information about the program from across the country and 
as far afield as europe and japan hundreds visited the county to 
scout for a homestead and more than 250 submitted applications 
last winter three homesteading hopefuls from colorado were 
arrested trying to break into an empty farmhouse another time two 
germans wandered into the local job service office saying they 
intended to homestead and needed work 
as a result some of the countys slightly more than 16000 
residents complained that the giveaway would attract too many 
undesireables to the area 
the county also had to take back initial claims that 50000 acres 
of taxforfeited county and state land were available because some 
of the state land was held in trust 
so far only two homesteads have been awarded going to local men 
who applied before the flood of outside interest but one of the two 
said he had trouble getting a loan to build a house he couldnt use 
his land as collateral because homesteaders only receive title to 
their property after living on it for 10 years 
under the plan to halt the program this fall at least 25 but no 
more than 100 applicants will be given land jerry andre the 
program administrator said there are about 20 more applicants that 
are likely to be approved 
the countys disenchantment with the program has done little to 
dampen the curiosity of people who want to homestead theyre 
still coming through more than ever andre said

a commercially sponsored tv show has been 
banned from the states high schools dealing a second big blow to 
the company that hopes to beam a daily newscast into the nations 
classrooms 
the new york board of regents unanimously rejected whittle 
communications channel one program friday saying they were 
worried the active commercialization of the programs would send 
the wrong message to high school students 
its a very tempting package that has a flaw said state 
education commissioner thomas sobol that flaw is that its wrong 
its wrong legally educationally financially and morally 
some regents also expressed anger with whittles aggressive 
lobbying in support of channel one edward meyer charged that 
some members of the education policysetting board told him whittle 
had offered them jobs or consulting contracts if they supported the 
project 
laura eshbaugh executive vice president for whittle 
communications said she knew nothing about any offers 
knoxville tennbased whittle has said it needs to sign up 40 
percent of the nations high schools if channel one is to 
succeed the first severe blow to that goal was delivered earlier 
this month when california officials threatened their schools with 
a loss of funds if they signed with whittle 
eshbaugh said she was disappointed with the new york boards 
decision but said channel one would survive the rejection 
whittle had increased its offer to the regents and taken its case 
to the public in the days leading to fridays board meeting the 
company ran fullpage advertisements in the new york times and meyer 
said some regents were bombarded by junk fax messages in support 
of whittle 
in return for an agreement to show the daily programs whittle 
had offered to wire high schools with complete closedcircuit 
television systems including satellite dishes televisions and 
videocassette recorders 
as the regents decision approached whittle officials offered to 
donate 1000 hours of satellite time so other educational 
programming could be shown in schools education department 
officials said 
but whittle wouldnt change the most debated aspect of its 
program the 12minute news program still had to contain two minutes 
of commercials for candy jeans acne cream and other products aimed 
at teenagers 
what it says to children is we dont care much about you 
sobol said but we care what we can get out of you 
several regents said they worried the commercials could cause 
poor students who couldnt afford items advertised to feel 
inadequate they also said the program seems geared to suburban 
white students instead of the more troubled city schools that are in 
dire need of the technology whittle could provide 
but eshbaugh noted that schools contain many other forms of 
advertising such as wall posters advertisements in yearbooks and 
magazines and brand names emblazoned on the clothing students wear 
commercialization is there she said however any of us 
might not like it there its there to stay 
the regents said the discussion with whittle has caused them to 
examine the extent of other advertising in school the education 
department will also look into other ways of getting more technology 
and television programs into school sobol said

energy department officials intend to decide 
whether a jurys ruling should prompt settlement of a lawsuit by the 
fernald uranium processing plants neighbors but a department 
spokesmen declined to say when 
in washington energy department spokesman will callicott was 
noncommittal friday following a us district court jurys 
nonbinding recommendation that neighbors of the feed materials 
production center be awarded 136 million in damages 
the jury issued its ruling thursday in the mock trial of a 
classaction suit filed by 14000 neighbors of the plant which 
processes uranium used in making the governments nuclear weapons 
neighbors claimed radioactive emissions from the plant have 
damaged their health and the environment and lowered property values 
the eightmember jurys verdict ended a summary jury trial an 
abbreviated procedure that judge s arthur spiegel used to encourage 
a settlement of the neighbors lawsuit against the former operator 
of the energy department plant 
energy department lawyer henry gill jr refused to say whether 
the jury verdict would prompt a settlement offer the residents 
lawyer stanley chesley said he would consider such an offer 
callicott said gill was not due back in washington until monday 
and that gill would have to confer with top department managers 
the jury ruled that national lead of ohio inc operated the feed 
materials production center in a way that caused neighbors to suffer 
the distress and lowered property values they had claimed 
the company operated the plant 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
under contract to the federal government from 1951 through 1985 
also named as a defendant was its parent company national lead 
industries inc 
the energy department defended the companies arguing that they 
could not be found liable because they carried out the governments 
directions the department admitted in documents filed with the 
court that the government sometimes told national lead of ohio 
managers to emphasize production and not to worry about 
environmental protection or regulations 
gill said any settlement of the case would be paid by the 
government because of an indemnification clause in its contract with 
the operator if there is no settlement the case goes to a real 
trial aug 15 before spiegel who presided at the shortened summary 
trial 
chesley representing the 14000 plaintiffs who live within five 
miles of the plant said the jurys verdict amounted to a total 
victory 
residents said in their lawsuit that radioactive contamination 
from the plant has polluted soil air and water causing them mental 
stress and making their homes undesirable 
the energy department estimates that 383000 pounds of 
radioactive uranium oxide dust has been released from faulty 
exhaustair filters since the plant opened government lawyers said 
the material has not endangered residents or harmed property 
westinghouse materials co of ohio which has operated the plant 
since january 1986 is not a defendant in the case

a former security chief accused in the murder 
of an investigative journalist denied involvement in the slaying 
saying he wouldnt have rushed to the scene of the crime if he had 
ordered the killing 
jose antonio zorrilla 47 spoke with reporters after a witness 
to the slaying of manuel buendia testified that he saw a man who 
resembled the killer go into office of the federal security 
department days after the may 30 1985 murder 
zorrilla chief of the fbilike department from 198284 listened 
from behind bars in the courtroom for three hours while a court 
official read juan manuel bautista ortiz who was buendias office

under questioning by the prosecutor rafael avanzi bautista said 
the man he saw 100 percent resembled the killer 
during his testimony bautista also said zorrilla arrived at the 
scene with agents from his office about 15 minutes after buendia was 
shot bautista said 
i was not going to be naive enough to go there immediately to 
see what happened if i had been responsible zorrilla said i 
would have said im not going it would have been infantile to go 
to the place where it happened 
he said he was a friend of the journalist and went 
targetshooting with him 
zorrilla pleaded innocent at his arraignment thursday before 
judge roberto hernandez martinez of mexico citys 34th penal court

return a formal indictment 
zorrilla faces 40 years in prison on the homicide charge and 22 
years on other accusations including abuse of authority and weapons 
charges

killed because of the frontpage columns he wrote for the newspaper 
excelsior 
he said he had touched on very delicate subjects 
in columns and books buendia wrote on corruption in high places 
drug trafficking the cia and gunrunning 
witnesses questioned during the murder investigation also linked 
zorrilla to drug trafficking and mexican narcotics kingpin rafael 
caro quintero zorrilla has denied such ties 
caro quintero is awaiting trial in the killing of us drug 
enforcement administration agent enrique camarena salazar and his 
mexican pilot alfredo zavala avelar in guadalajara in 1985

china expressed deep regret to britain today 
for delaying a meeting on the transition of hong kong to chinese 
rule 
britain put off the session of the sinobritish joint liaison 
group on the future of hong kong originally scheduled for next 
month in london to protest chinas suppression of the prodemocracy 
student movement no new date has been set 
in reaction china said today that britain will be held 
responsible for all possible consequences 
the foreign ministry in its statement said it hopes britain 
remains committed to handing over hong kong in 1997 under an 
agreement made in 1984 but added we express our deep regret over 
this irresponsible action taken by the british government 
britains foreign office has said it will honor the accord but 
cannot conduct normal business at the moment as if nothing had 
happened 
the pact returns hong kong to china in eight years but guarantees 
that china will not interfere with its capitalist system for at 
least 50 years 
the current suppression of dissent on the mainland has raised 
anxieties in the british colony about chinese rule many hong kong 
residents have demanded that britain allow more of them to resettle 
there 
prime minister margaret thatcher said resettling all 325 million 
british passport holders in hong kong is politically impossible she 
has instead pledged greater flexibility in existing arrangements 
particularly for those who worked for the british government 
the joint liaison group is supposed to meet three times a year to 
work out details of the transition its second meeting this year had 
been scheduled for july 1821

east peace plan 
according to arab reports the strike shut down the gaza strip 
and principal west bank cities

reported wounded in the west bank arab reports said they said the 
army conducted raids on the west bank villages of osarin and hawara 
near nablus and about two dozen residents were reported beaten with 
assault rifles 
a palestinian reporter in gaza city who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said youths burned tires in the streets and threw rocks 
at military vehicles 
strike pamphlets issued by the underground leaders of the 
18month uprising said the action was to call on the american 
administration to hold an international conference as it is the 
only way to reach peace in the region 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs peace plan calls for palestinian 
elections in the west bank and gaza to be followed by negotiations 
with the elected reprsentatives on a form of limited selfrule 
he opposes a proposed international peace conference that would 
be sponsored by the united nations and would include the middle east 
parties directly involved and also the united states and soviet 
union shamir has said such a conference would be biased against 
israel and demand territorial concessions that would jeopardize the 
jewish state 
there was scattered violence in the occupied territories friday

palestinians in the gaza town of rafah opened fire killing three 
people 
hospital officials in rafah said 13 arabs were wounded in the

23 amir fuad nasser 25 and 17yearold ahmed abed rabbo abu oun

clashes after the noon moslem prayers then abu abed was killed 
and protests escalated

prime minister charles haughey conceded 
today he had not won a majority in parliament in the irish general 
election but said he would attempt to form a government 
i didnt get the answer i wanted haughey said 
with more than 90 percent of the seats decided after thursdays 
election it was clear that haughey would have to govern with fewer 
friendly faces the results prompted talk of a historic realignment 
of irish politics 
one of the disappointing things is that irish politics may now 
become polarized between right and left said progressive 
democrats leader desmond omalley 
nonetheless haughey said he had no intention of resigning as 
leader of the fianna fail party the countrys largest 
we will form a government he said we will do our 
political best to provide the people with a government 
national election returns early today showed a surge of the irish 
left with the labor party and the workers party gaining seats and 
the green party getting into irelands parliament called the dail 
for the first time 
the state television network rte projected that fianna fail would 
win 77 or 78 seats a loss of two or three 
with 151 of 165 races decided fianna fail had won 70 seats fine 
gael 47 labor party 15 progressive democrats 6 workers party 7 
democratic socialist 1 green party 1 independent and others 4 
recounts were under way in six constituencies 
it was a sharp setback for haughey who called the vote hoping to 
gain his first majority in five elections during his previous four 
terms he governed with support from other parties 
its quite clear that you cant impose stringent financial 
policies which are unpopular and expect people to give you the sort 
of majority we were looking for he said in an rte interview 
haughey had steeply reduced irelands budget deficit but at a 
cost of sharp cuts in social services he admitted during the 
campaign he was surprised at the ferocity of resentment especially 
against health service cuts 
asked why he had called the election haughey said it was a 
political judgment that his support in parliament from the 
opposition fine gael party wasnt going to last any longer and i 
was anxious to get a working majority so that i could go ahead and 
implement our very comprehensive national development plan 
fine gael leader alan dukes derided haughey as a fivetime 
loser 
though he had predicted earlier in the week that his party would 
win the election dukes said today he was very happy with his 
modest gains 
fianna fail soldiers of destiny and fine fael family of the 
irish are both conservative economically but fine gael tends to be 
more liberal on social issues the progressive democrats are 
breakaways from fianna fail 
the left meanwhile exulted in its victories 
this is the best day we the left have had in the history of 
the state said jim kemmy a surprise winner in east limerick he 
will be the only democratic socialist in the dail 
were talking about the left breaking the mold said paty 
rabbittee a winner for the workers party in southwest dublin 
james downey editor of the new nation magazine said haugheys 
party fianna fail had itself to blame for the leftist surge 
fianna fail did something that they have never ever done 
before they made a choice between middleclass and workingclass 
vote and they got the middleclass vote downey said friday night 
haugheys program of fiscal austerity won approval from the 
middle class but cuts in health services apparently hurt its 
support among the working class 
gerry osullivan of the labor party who won in northcentral 
cork said a hospital closing was a factor in his victory 
despite the disappointment for haughey the next term would still 
mark the first time he has served twice in a row he was beaten 
after all his other terms 
fianna fail claims the mantle of forces that originally opposed 
the partition of ireland in 1921 its nationalism has kept it in 
power for most of the republics 68year history

a united mine workers wildcat strike 
that grew during the week to include more than 20000 miners in six 
states shows no sign of ending umw officials say 
were having trouble keeping them in the mines said roger 
myers international executive board member for umw district 11 in 
indiana 
on friday the wildcat walkout idled 2500 miners in 
pennsylvania 1390 in indiana 790 in virginia 295 in kentucky 
200 in tennessee and about twothirds of west virginias 24000 
miners company officials said 
at amax coal cos ayrshire mine at chandler ind umw local 
1907 president greg young said after a union meeting friday that 
workers will continue to strike although he told them the umw 
constitution and contract require them to return to work 
west virginia gov gaston caperton said he is continuing every 
day in a quiet behindthescenes way talking to both sides to see 
what we can do in state government to bring this to an end 
the walkout began monday in southern west virginia in sympathy 
with about 1600 umw members on strike against the pittston coal 
group in west virginia and virginia 
the original strike by west virginia and virginia miners began in 
april when pittston dropped out of the bituminous coal operators 
association to negotiate with the union independently the two sides 
have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations 
in pennsylvania district 2 president nick molnar said union 
officials planned to tell each of the 52 local unions that their 
members should report to work as usual molnar said he could not 
predict whether the miners would obey 
molnar was among union leaders who led a friday morning rally by 
about 5000 miners in ebensburg pa near johnstown 
molnar said the miners supported striking pittston workers and 
criticized the court system which he said is practicing economic 
terrorism against the mine workers organization 
in hazleton pa meanwhile district 25 officials are organizing 
miners who could leave on short notice from umw president richard 
trumka to picket in support of the pittston strikers said bill ray 
district 25 president and an acting member of the unions 
international executive board 
on friday us district judge william kidd in clarksburg issued 
backtowork orders for seven consolidation coal co mines in 
northern west virginia striking miners have ignored similar orders 
in southern west virginia all week 
the strikers friday included about 1600 miners who failed to 
report for work at rochester amp pittsburgh coal co operations in 
central pennsylvania company spokesman hank waneck said 
we are being penalized for a labor problem in another area it 
appears that the united mine workers are returning to the era of 
instability of the 1970s which contributed to the decline of umw 
mined coal from 70 percent to less than 35 percent of the nations 
production today waneck said

slovenias parliament has adopted a 
constitutional amendment granting this nations most developed 
republic the right to secede news reports said today 
the amendment which was passed on friday states that the 
slovenian people have the lasting and inalienable right to 
selfdetermination including the right to secession and 
association the official tanjug news agency said 
it was unlikely however that federal authorities in belgrade 
would allow the northern republic to break away from the union 
yugoslavia a loose federaration of six republics and two 
provinces containing various nationalities and religions is passing 
through its worst economic and political crisis annual inflation 
exceeds 600 percent and there has been an alarming increase in 
social and ethnic tension 
the republic of slovenia whose leadership advocates regional 
autonomy greater democracy and closer ties with the west has long 
been at odds with the southern republic of serbia where officials 
favor greater central control and a stronger federal government 
slovenias communist party leadership is considered the most liberal 
in yugoslavia 
the clash between the two republics characterized by official 
media as a propaganda campaign between two countries at war has 
generated serbian and slovenian nationalist feelings 
in an unusually blunt interview published friday slovenias 
communist party chief milan kucan said relations between the 
republics are frozen 
we have to decide if we want to continue living together or 
not kucan was quoted as saying he said coexistence should not 
be at any cost 
slavko goldstein president of the croatian socialliberal union 
an independent group has said the ruling communist party cannot 
solve yugoslavias crisis only an agreement among noncommunist 
forces can prevent the country from falling apart he said 
yugoslavias communist leadership is split between two 
irreconcilable political concepts slovenian and serbian which 
could cause a civil war similar to that in lebanon he said 
kosovo a province of serbia has been torn by ethnic strife 
in march 25 people were killed when ethnic albanians rioted to 
protest constitutional changes giving serbia more control over the 
province in kosovo 85 percent of the 18 million inhabitants are 
ethnic albanians

beijing this afternoon its a great country i hope i can come 
back some day 
the pair arrived in hong kong without incident three hours later 
pessin said upon arriving that everything the chinese 
government said about voice of america is wrong the government 
accused the voa of spreading rumors and instigating turmoil 
i think they sent us out because they dont want the world and 
most particularly they dont want the chinese people to know the 
truth about whats been happening in china especially what happened

the government has recovered more gold jade 
and stone artifacts that were stolen from the national museum of 
archaeology in a daring christmas day robbery in 1985 an official 
said 
attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo said one of the 19 
pieces of jewelry found friday was among the most important of all 
the stolen items 
authorities recovered 111 items last weekend on wednesday

returning them to the museum 
the artifacts date from 500 bc to 2500 bc and include masks 
and jewelry from mexicos ancient aztec mixteca maya and zapotec

trevino 24 for 45 days before his arrest on june 9 alvarez said 
earlier this week he said officials were seeking another man 
identified as ramon sardina garcia 
sardina left a box of tools at the home of a friend maria 
antonieta ponce mercado who became suspicious after learning of the 
mans alleged involvement in the museum robbery and told her uncle 
alvarez said the uncle contacted the attorney generals office on 
friday 
alvarez said federal agents and museum officials went to ms 
ponces house in a mexico city suburb and found 19 pieces of jewelry 
in the box 
among what we found was one of the five most important missing 
pieces a figure of a mayan governor he said friday night 
alvarez said earlier this week that perches and sardina had 
staked out the museum for six months the pair then jumped the 
fence crawled in through an air conditioning duct and looted seven 
display cases he said 
the attorney general said the men kept the artifacts for more 
than a year then exchanged some for drugs

a national guard helicopter flying in 
dense fog crashed in a residential area on cape cod early today 
killing the six men aboard after narrowly missing several houses 
authorities said 
rescue workers recovered the six bodies using heavy equipment to 
lift the uh1 bell helicopter and remove one of the victims pinned 
underneath 
there were no surviving crewmen and no injuries on the ground 
fire department deputy william greene said earlier he had said 
there were fears that more than six bodies would be found in the 
wreckage 
the helicopter was from a delaware army national guard unit based 
in new castle del guard spokeswoman terry blevins said from 
delaware she said the regiment is attending training camp at camp 
edwards about 30 miles from the crash site 
camp edwards is part of the otis air force base complex a person 
answering the telephone at the base this morning said the base 
spokewoman was not immediately available 
ms blevins said three of the victims were from delaware two of 
them were identified as 1st lt david joseph hendry of wilmington 
del and staff sgt benjamin robert greenplate of newark del the 
name of the third delaware soldier and the other three victims were 
not immediately released 
the chopper crashed shortly after midnight in a residential 
neighborhood missing one home by just 100 feet greene said 
wreckage was scattered in a 150foot radius from the crash site 
police said there was no damage to homes as the helicopter cut a 
20footwide swath through the woods strewing doors glass and 
other debris 
neighbors said the aircraft came close enough to make their 
houses vibrate 
we said this guys going to crash and a couple of seconds 
later he did said john palino 
it was like a crumpled piece of paper palino said of the 
helicopter we didnt want to get near it because we were afraid 
it would explode 
at least one resident reported hearing what sounded like engine 
trouble just before the aircraft crashed you could hear the 
blades stopping and then like a thump bill oconnor said 
a team of military investigators reached the scene about 530 
am the cause of the crash was not immediately known said richard 
bunker a state aeronautical inspector 
officials said one or more helicopters had been flying over 
yarmouth for much of the evening yarmouth is about 85 miles south

a 21gun salute is par for the course 
at the kabul golf and country club or to be precise a barrage 
from the rocket launcher fired by afghan troops in the hills near 
the dusty ninehole course 
its great fun to play here an asian diplomat said where 
else on earth do you play and pick up your own trophies he added 
pointing to a pile of metal shell casings he had collected walking 
from one hole to the next 
president najibs government in an attempt to show that things 
are getting better in battlescarred afghanistan has reopened the 
course and surrounding kargha lake area to civilians government 
soldiers guard the golfers mostly asian diplomats and asians and 
europeans working for un agencies 
the usbacked guerrillas who have been fighting since 1978 to 
oust kabuls sovietbacked government are only a few miles away in 
the paghman mountains on the other side of the lake 
between greens which are actually browns made of gravel the 
golfers gauge the war as well as their backswings 
just as they were ready to tee off friday their weekly day away 
from work there was a barrage of rocket fire from the government 
outpost on a nearby hill 
from the sound it looks like they are using the bm21s 
today the asian diplomat said today there seems to be more 
than average activity from the government side 
as the six golfers reached the seventh hole there were two loud 
sounds followed by billows of smoke and dust in the hills 
judging from this sides the governments action today the 
other side is in real trouble said an asian health official 
working for the united nations like the others he asked to remain 
anonymous 
the fact that we are able to play golf in kabul proves that 
things are certainly getting better the health official said 
except for the noise the missiles and rockets creates which does 
affect our game we have no other problem 
but the young afghan caddies whisper to visitors to be careful 
sometimes new sand traps appear from week to week bunkers dug in 
the course by government soldiers 
the 30yearold golf course 10 miles northwest of kabul was set 
up to cater to the foreign community and once drew dozens of 
golfers mostly us and western european diplomats and un 
staffers but the americans and their allies closed their embassies 
last winter citing fears of a blood bath when the soviet army 
withdrew the last of its combat troops in february 
so far the guerrillas have not come over the mountains to fight a 
facetoface war with the government troops who are still supplied 
by the soviet union but during the winter they stepped up their 
activity around kargha lake and the government declared the area 
offlimits to civilians 
there was a time when we used to refuse membership but now we 
want more people to join us the asian health official said 
a decade ago before the soviet army arrived to back the afghan 
government in the civil war the golf club had 45 members 
now only four to six golfers make the rounds on fridays the 
weekly islamic holy day a nonworking day for afghans and 
foreigners alike in kabul 
after the game the golfers sit on the banks of a narrow stream 
running beside the course their clubhouse has been taken over by 
the afghan army but the golfers dont appear to mind 
here try to put the ball in that hole a west european 
official from the un said handing his club to a soldier 
the young soldier swung the club and the ball flew past the 
green his comrades laughed 
another stepped forward took aim and swung the ball came within 
inches of the hole 
many of them have been watching us for months and i am sure 
some of them could be good golfers if trained the european said 
but they have a battle to fight but maybe one day we can have a 
go with some of them 
i mean in golf

an east german jetliner carrying 113 people veered 
into a field and caught fire today while trying to take off in east 
berlin killing at least five people and injuring 39 the east 
german state news agency said 
the death count was likely to climb as rescue workers searched 
for more bodies in the charred wreckage of the plane the agency 
adn said 
it said 13 of the injured were hurt seriously and that about 50 
people escaped without injury that would leave about 19 people 
missing it must be assumed there are more passengers in the 
rubble who have died adn said 
passengers aboard the moscowbound ilyushin62 aircraft scrambled 
out of emergency exits to escape the burning plane the news agency 
said 
according to adn the aircraft started its takeoff at 829 am 
taxiing about 500 yards down the runway at schoenefeld airfield for 
some unknown reason it then careened into a field and caught fire 
adn said 
it said the sovietbuilt jetliner carrying 103 passengers and 10 
crew was owned by interflug the stateowned east german airline 
it said the plane was fully fueled 
diethart guenther a safety expert with interflug said the 
airplane was torn apart and completely burned out in the 
accident adn said 
it took firemen about an hour to douse the blaze it said 
adn said the passengers who escaped were lucky because one wing 
of the fourengine jet remained intact and did not burn 
the last serious aircraft accident at schoenefeld airport 
occurred on dec 12 1986 when an aeroflot tupolev 134 crashed into 
the woods as it was approaching for a landing killing 80 people 
investigators later said the cause of the accident was a 
misunderstanding between the pilot and airport control tower

italy is taking the idea of the european common 
market a step further than importing butter hair dryers and 
chocolates it is importing politicians 
in a move unprecedented in europe italy has allowed citizens 
from all 12 common market countries to run on italian tickets in 
sundays european parliament election 
in addition to the usual offering of political leaders italians 
have the choice of an irish nationalist an exiled soviet dissident 
or a leader of frances 1968 student rebellion one party even tried 
to enlist salman rushdie author of the controversial novel the 
satanic verses 
the candidates are barnstorming italy campaigning in french 
german spanish and english in a sometimes bewildering glimpse of 
what life could be like in a unified europe where people goods and 
services would move freely between the countries 
the new europe is to be realized by 1992 under an eec plan 
adopted in 1987 
id like to know italian well enough to speak it briton 
david steel told a recent rome campaign rally speaking italian with 
a thick scottish accent but unfortunately im not able to 
therefore ill switch to english the social and liberal democrat 
said 
asked if they wanted a translator the crowd cried no 
however they looked blank as steel joked and harangued until the 
translator gave it to them in italian 
italians are strong supporters of european unity and have one of 
the highest national voting rates for the european parliament 83 
percent in 1984 a similar percentage of the 47 million eligible 
voters is expected to turn out this time to choose italys 81 
representatives on the 518member body comprised of elected members 
from each eec nation 
italians do not have a very high opinion of their own 
government said ottavio lavaggi an italian member of the liberal 
group in the european parliament which has little daytoday power 
if tomorrow there is a united europe it cant be governed worse 
than the italian government is now thats one of the origins of 
sympathy for this idea of foreigners 
putting symbolic figures or famous entertainers on party tickets 
is a timehonored practice in italy where porn star ilona 
cicciolina staller sits in parliament and european parliament 
representatives have included a tv host who ran while under arrest 
on charges of mafia collaboration 
the candidates nicknamed blood donors for their political 
contributions are intended to draw votes or prove a point 
the enlisting of foreign candidates is all that and more 
it is a component in a certain way linked to the strong 
foreignmania present in italy said arturo parisi a professor 
of political sociology at the university of bologna 
good or bad this is a residual of the defeat of the fascist 
nationalism of dictator benito mussolini he said in a telephone 
interview 
he explained that many people were ashamed of the fascist rule 
and by its propaganda glorifying italy voters rejected 
nationalistic themes and were attracted to nonitalian images such 
as europeanism he said 
among the imported personalities running is daniel cohnbendit 
known as danny the red for leading the 1968 french student 
uprising he is running on the greens ticket 
italys social democrats are running leonid plyushch a soviet 
dissident living in france 
other foreigners include kalman domotor de szeodemeter a 
hungarian anticommunist exile living in france who is running for 
the neofascist italian socialist movement and danny morrison a 
member of northern irelands sinn fein the political arm of the 
irish republican army he is running for italys farleft 
proletarian democracy party 
most tickets still are led by traditional italian politicians 
the foreigners are not expected to significantly affect the balance 
of the italian vote which will likely give the dominant christian 
democrats the top position as they have domestically 
despite the presence of the foreigners the campaign has focused 
on domestic rather than european politics the campaign comes in the 
wake of the collapse of italys 48th government and parties are 
hoping to show strength to improve their position in negotiations 
for a new government 
lavaggi says the election of steel who is running on the 
combined liberalrepublicanradical ticket would be a symbolic 
gesture supporting the parties interest in a more unified europe 
but he says the nationality of the candidates is not an issue 
if you think in the perspective of a united europe he steel 
is a european citizen born in the united kingdom it doesnt 
raise any problems he said

when charles chuck simmons took over as 
police chief in this atlanta suburb last year the first thing he 
did was get rid of the traditional sixshot 38caliber revolver 
weve just finished our transition to the 9mm glock 
semiautomatic pistol which can carry up to 20 rounds simmons 
said now were looking at replacing our shotguns with 9mm 
carbines 
simmons isnt alone in beefing up his arsenal more and more 
police departments big and small are switching to semiautomatic or 
fully automatic weapons most of the new weapons fire 9mm bullets 
which are slightly smaller than 38caliber rounds but 
semiautomatics use clips that hold many more bullets than 
traditional police arms 
simmons said clipfed pistols and rifles give the police three 
things they badly need to combat todays heavily armed criminals 
more firepower quicker reloading and greater accuracy over longer 
distances 
simmons came to marietta from palm bay fla where he says his 
officers were outgunned in a 1987 shootout at two shopping 
centers with a man carrying a semiautomatic rifle with a 30round 
clip 
two police officers were among the six people killed he 
said it appeared one of our officers was fatally wounded while 
trying to reload his empty revolver 
simmons who said palm bay was switching to semiautomatic pistols 
at the time of the shootout now has rearmed three departments in 
seven years 
im either a leader in the field or a jerk depending upon your 
point of view he said 
the trend goes against other efforts to ban highfirepower 
weapons such as californias recent law against civilian possession 
of the ak47 assault rifle and it troubles some law enforcement 
officials 
its true the police are facing ever more dangerous weapons 
said hubert williams director of the police foundation a law 
enforcement think tank in washington however the police are part 
of the civilian population in this country and to the degree we 
increase the type of arms they bear they become to that same 
degree a more militarytype police force 
simmons feels much the same 
ideally we shouldnt need these new weapons he said but 
there are so many semiautomatics on the street these days it would 
take years to get rid of them even if we banned them tomorrow 
meanwhile we simply cant afford to let ourselves be outgunned when 
the shooting starts 
police swat teams have used powerful weapons for years but its 
the cop on the beat who is getting the new 9mm pistols with names 
like glock beretta ruger sig sauer and taurus 
these new nines with the funny names are where its at right 
now said dewey stokes president of the 198000member fraternal 
order of police 
we know that many many of our members have switched over to 
nines but we dont know just how many he said were polling 
them in an effort to find out 
the national sheriffs association is conducting a similar poll of 
the nations 29000 sheriffs and deputies 
we feel that the wheel gun or revolver just isnt adequate 
anymore said bud meeks director of the sheriffs association 
los angeles washington dc miami boston atlanta and 
columbus ohio are among big city police departments converting to 
semiautomatic pistols and chicago is studying the idea 
new york decided to stick with sixshot revolvers but several of 
its suburbs have switched 
the movement definitely isnt confined to big cities said 
cheryl epps of the international association of police chiefs 
while dc is going to 9mm for example prince william county 
virginia further up the road also is armed to the teeth with fully 
automatic weapons theyre everywhere now she said 
in winnetka ill a suburb of chicago police chief herbert timm 
created a stir when he proposed putting uzi machine guns in squad 
cars 
simmons here in marietta said he also has considered machine 
guns 
we feel the shotgun is outdated as a street weapon given what 
were coming up against he said just a few days ago for 
example we answered a routine trouble call and wound up 
confiscating an ar15 the commercial variety of the m16 
semiautomatic rifle 
sgt jack schmida firearms expert with the los angeles police 
department said an lapd officer was killed last year by a gunman 
with an ar15 
the drug dealers usually shoot each other with these weapons 
but they do shoot at us from time to time said schmida whose 
department will begin monday to slowly phase in 9mm berettas by 
issuing them to new recruits 
in columbus ohio police officers are given a choice 
our officers can carry a 16shot 9mm semiautomatic or a 
nineshot cliploaded 45caliber pistol said dewey stokes a 
member of the 1300member force 
with the 38s the officer carried a total of 18 rounds 
counting the 12 in his belt and six in the revolver stokes said 
now with the nines they will carry 48 rounds and thats a 
heckuva difference 
in houston officers are armed with a variety of pistols 
they buy their own weapon and can carry practically anything 
they want said firearms instructor jw walston as a result 
our officers carry a multitude of calibers everything from 9mm to 
44 magnums to 45s however we do encourage them to not carry 
38s and we suggest they use hollow point rounds 
many urban police departments have begun using hollow point 
bullets a softnosed round that has greater stopping power it 
tends to spread out and produce more wallop from increased tissue 
damage 
some financially strapped cities cant make make acrosstheboard 
purchases of semiautomatic pistols which cost from 350 to 550 
but they frequently permit officers to buy their own sidearms 
that is the case in stockton calif where a gunman armed with 
an ak47 rifle opened fire on a schoolyard in january killing five 
children and wounding 29 students and a teacher 
sgt ed williams a 24year veteran of the stockton force said 
he made the switch and became a big fan of the 9mm pistol 
im not a gun nut he said in fact i wouldnt mind going 
to the english method of unarmed police officers but the switch 
from a 38 to a 9mm has greatly improved my accuracy and 
confidence 
officers in walla walla wash huntington wva and muskogee 
okla also may buy their own semiautomatic pistols in muskogee 
threefourths of the 75 officers have switched to 9mm police maj 
rex eskridge said 
like many towns in florida where drug trafficking is 
particularly heavy palm bay has come to see 9mm weapons as a 
necessity 
in addition to the 9mm sidearms we also provide our officers 
with 9mm rifles said frank mcbee the departments firing range 
officer right now were getting five to 10 requests a week from 
other law enforcement agencies for information about the rifles the 
requests have come from all around the country even the fbi has 
requested information about them

ely an alexandria va financial analyst 
the industrys largest trade group the us league of savings 
institutions until recently had a reputation for effectiveness 
rivaling such nottobecrossed groups as the national rifle 
association and the american association of retired persons that 
appears to have changed 
clearly the tide has turned said economist robert litan of 
the brookings institution a public policy research group theyre 
on the run 
before house passage of the sampl bill the league and independent 
sampl lobbyists pulled out all stops to preserve an accounting break 
known as supervisory good will it relieves about a fourth of the 
industry from rules requiring sampl owners to risk their own capital 
ahead of depositors money 
the industry distributed buttons bought fullpage newspaper 
advertisements and sent sampl executives roaming the halls of congress 
to buttonhole hometown congressmen 
it was all to no avail the house rebuffed the industry by a 
suprisingly lopsided 32694 vote after bush threatened to veto the 
bill if it included a weakening amendment offered by rep henry j 
hyde rill 
a populist wind was sweeping across the house said rep 
charles schumer dny a member of the house banking committee and 
one of the most vocal advocates of tough sampl standards i 
think the sampl industry will never be the powerful force it once 
was 
publicly the administration is crediting bipartisan 
congressional leadership for the vote while also passing word that 
bushs lastminute pressure was what actually sealed the sampl lobbys 
fate 
unquestionably the biggest factor was the presidents 
determination and leadership and his willingness to draw a line in 
the sand said an official who asked not to be quoted by name 
schumer and other democrats charge that bush weighed in only 
after it was clear he would be embarrassed by the spectacle of 
democrats overcoming republican opposition to win a victory for the 
president 
we couldnt have done it alone acknowledged richard breeden 
bushs key adviser on sampls but he added what youve seen has 
been active presidential leadership 
i think congress has responded to it in the very finest 
tradition of showing bipartisan spirit in solving major national 
problems he said 
democrats also would have faced image problems if they had voted 
with the industry their house leaders jim wright of texas and tony 
coelho of california were driven from their posts in part by 
allegations they granted special favors to the sampl industry 
i think the new democratic leadership did not want to see a 
headline written house caves to sampl lobby thats probably 
the key factor said kenneth a guenther executive vice president 
of the independent bankers association of america which represents 
small banks 
even more than the hyde amendment vote the subsequent success of 
a parliamentary maneuver pressed by rep jim leach riowa shows 
how much the sampl lobby has slipped 
leach wanted to delete more than a half dozen provisions 
benefiting large sampls and some of the nations most powerful 
companies including citicorp merrill lynch and sears roebuck amp 
co but he was denied the chance by the house rules committee 
shortly before 11 pm thursday with house members anxious to go 
home after a 13hour session leach used a parliamentary maneuver to 
force a vote on removing special exceptions that had been inserted 
by such senior banking committee members as reps doug barnard 
dga bill nelson dfla and carroll hubbard dky leach won 
4118 
a house aide speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
banking committees phone lines were flooded after midnight thursday 
with calls from outraged lobbyists wanting to know how leach could 
have succeeded 
its amazing absolutely amazing that that sort of measure to 
strike out all the goodies passed almost unanimously guenther 
said 
leach said he believes reform sentiment is growing in the 
congress and members were unwilling to ask their constituents to 
pay for a bailout that included special exceptions 
but litan of the brookings institution said so many house members 
had lost battles for hometown institutions that they werent willing 
to approve breaks for banking committee insiders 
the reasoning according to schumer was why make seven or 
eight exceptions when youre not making others 
the house bill probably after the july 4 recess goes to a 
conference with the senate which passed its sampl bill in april sampl 
lobbyists despite their defeat in the highly visible venue of the 
house floor will try again to wrest concessions in the less public 
conference 
this is seen as desperation time by the sampls and theyre going 
to be working harder than ever on the conferees id give 5050 odds 
that were going to end up with something weaker than the house 
bill said ely the analyst in alexandria va 
we know that all kinds of strange and wonderous things happen 
in conference the twoweek recess provides plenty of time for 
an awful lot of stuff to be worked out he said

gasoline supplies this summer are likely to be 
the tightest in years but motorists wont be idling in long lines 
unless the distribution system is crimped by a refinery or pipeline 
accident analysts say 
the supply squeeze may trigger more price increases as the summer 
driving season wears on yet interviews with government industry 
and independent analysts indicate at least a modest possibility that 
prices could drop a few cents a gallon 
well not see a gasoline shortage barring a major supply 
accident says john lichtblau executive director of the petroleum 
industry research foundation in new york 
he says refineries are running full blast to meet a growing 
demand for gasoline so the supply system is more vulnerable than 
usual to accidental outages 
if any refinery breaks down you could have some problems 
lichtblau says 
the national average gasoline price slipped about a penny a 
gallon between midmay and early june to 117 after a steep and 
steady rise earlier in the spring according to the lundberg survey 
a los angelesbased group that tracks gasoline prices through 
surveys of 12000 service stations nationwide 
overall prices now are nearly 20 cents a gallon higher than at 
the start of the year 
the price outlook for summer is clouded by conflicting forces at 
work in the market 
more summertime driving would be expected to push up prices at 
the pump yet wholesale prices paid by service station dealers have 
come down in recent weeks its not clear however that dealers 
will pass on their savings to consumers since they took a beating 
in late march and april when wholesale prices skyrocketed in the 
aftermath of the exxon oil tanker spill in alaska on march 24 
retailers have not gained back all that they lost in profit 
margins says trilby lundberg head of the gasoline survey so they 
may not be ready to drop prices she said 
the big price jump following the oil spill which only briefly 
interrupted crude oil supplies to the west coast was one of the 
steepest on record it sparked accusations on capitol hill of price 
gouging and possible collusion among the oil companies 
the companies say they have simply passed on the higher prices 
they are paying for crude oil lichtblau says crude accounts for 
about half the cost of making gasoline 
edwin rothschild assistant director of the citizenlabor energy 
coalition says gasoline prices were bound to rise this spring 
because of growing demand and a variety of factors that have 
constrained gasoline production but he contends the oil companies 
used the exxon spill as an excuse to push up prices to service 
station dealers much faster than was justified 
rothschild says prices are likely to jump another nickel a gallon 
this summer but he rejects a forecast by buyers up a 
washingtonbased consumer group that motorists soon could find 
themselves in gas lines reminiscent of the 1970s 
thats ludicrous says rothschild he and other analysts say 
any further squeeze on supplies will push up prices not force 
stations to close pumps 
christopher dyson author of the buyers up report of june 13 
says one of the key reasons for expecting gas lines is that existing 
stocks of gasoline and the availability of foreign supplies are 
not enough to meet growing demand 
we could see spot shortages in the form of gas lines by the 
beginning of august he says 
peter beutel an analyst with the new york investment firm of 
elders futures had predicted last april a 50 percent chance of gas 
lines this summer but he now says the chances have dropped to about 
20 percent because the higher prices have attracted new supplies 
thomas petrie a partner in the denverbased oil consulting firm 
petrie parkman says he cannot rule out the possibility of brief 
shortages of gasoline this summer even if there are no refinery 
accidents or other big problems he says any shortages would be 
very localized not something that is national 
one of the main reasons for concern in petries view is the 
effect new environmental regulations are having on refinery 
operations 
the environmental protection agency in march imposed new rules to 
limit gasoline fumes during the summer months the rules called 
reid vapor pressure standards are intended to cut emissions of 
volatile hydrocarbons from gasoline these hydrocarbons such as 
butane form ozone a major component of smog 
to meet the standard oil refiners have to change the mix of 
their gasoline this has added to refining costs and crimped output 
its causing a tight market petrie said 
the energy department said in a report last month that the 
environmental standards were affecting supplies but it also cited 
the effects of growing demand for gasoline it predicted demand 
would reach a 10year high this summer 
we do see a tight gasoline situation going into the summer 
said calvin kilgore director of the departments office of energy 
markets and end use he added however that it would be pushing 
it a bit to say gas lines are likely

he drove to work at the joint us military assistance group in 
quezon city 
in october 1987 rebels killed three americans and a filipino 
civilian in coordinated ambushes outside clark 
the rebels have repeatedly threatened to attack us personnel 
because of washingtons support for president corazon aquinos 
campaign to crush the guerrillas 20year insurgency

republicans and democrats alike the nations 
governors generally support president bushs call for tougher 
sentences for violent criminals limits on plea bargaining and the 
death penalty 
i applaud the presidents federal initiatives and support his 
concept of increasing the mandatory sentence for crimes involving 
violence or drugs said indiana gov evan bayh a democrat 
bayh noted that indiana has already added drugrelated murders to 
the states capital punishment statute 
in a speech thursday to graduates of the federal law enforcement 
training academy in glynco ga bush called on the nations 
governors to offer statelevel support for three planks of his 
anticrime package 
the president has proposed doubling to 10 years the mandatory 
prison term for using semiautomatic weapons in violent crimes 
elimination of plea bargaining for federal firearms crimes and an 
expanded death penalty 
when a criminal commits a crime with a gun and someone dies 
justice demands something in return the ultimate penalty death 
bush said 
i call on governors to match this federal initiative and 
propose these same three standards at home mandatory time no deals 
without cooperation and the death penalty he said 
bushs proposed crime package that was formally submitted to 
congress last week includes a 5 percent bonus in federal law 
enforcement grants for states that adopt model legislation providing 
mandatory minimum sentences for firearmsrelated crimes 
north carolinas republican governor jim martin said he favored 
mandatory prison time for criminals who use guns in violent or 
drugrelated crimes but mandatory sentences for these criminals 
would put even more strain on the states crowded prisons he noted 
the way we have to solve that is to build more prisons for 
those who are involved in drugrelated crimes so they can serve 
their terms he said 
they wont be selling drugs to society if we can keep them 
away martin said 
illinois gov james r thompson a republican who once served as 
chief federal prosecutor in chicago echoed martins concern about 
overcrowded prisons 
the failure to have a sufficient prison space compels 
prosecutors and judges to give to lenient deals to criminals that 
encourages crime not discourages it thompson said 
thompson said he supported bushs call for an expanded death 
penalty and added that the presidents proposal in some ways 
mirrors the kind of program that we have seen in illinois for the 
last 13 years 
while plea bargaining is widely practiced as it is in most 
states illinois has mandatory prison sentences for a variety of 
felonies including murder attempted murder sexual asault armed 
robbery and serious drug trafficking 
in a statement issued through a spokesman kentucky gov wallace 
wilkinson a democrat said he also supported the pillars of bushs 
program 
our message has to be clear more time for violent crime no 
deal to drug deals the ultimate penalty for the ultimate crime 
kentucky however like most states has no restrictions on plea 
bargaining and there are no mandatory prison sentences 
limits on plea bargaining were not universally supported 
while he favors the concept of limiting plea bargaining iowa 
gov terry branstad a republican says its not practical 
youve got to give prosecutors some flexibility obviously 
sometimes they plea bargain because they dont think they could get 
a conviction on the higher offense 
branstad also said he didnt believe the death penalty is a 
panacea 
the governor said he favors the death penalty for some but not 
all cases this may save some innocent victims from being 
murdered branstad said of his support for the death penalty for 
kidnapping and for killers of sexabuse victims 
iowa does not have a death penalty statute and it is not likely 
that capital punishment would be enacted while democrats control the 
legislature 
in nearby kansas gov mike hayden a republican said bushs 
proposals dovetail with what we are doing at the state level 
especially in the area of drug trafficking 
while kansas does not have a death penalty the state has an 
automatic life sentence for firstdegree murder the law bars parole 
for at least 15 years kansas also imposes mandatory sentences for 
felonies committed with firearms 
missouri gov john ashcroft a republican meanwhile is planning 
to sign a bill that could result in the death penalty for defendants 
convicted of drugrelated murders 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis who lost to bush in a 
presidential race last fall that featured gop attacks on his states 
prison system said the presidents strategy is doomed to fail 
all these things have been tried dukakis said 
unless were serious about education and prevention and 
treatment as well as effective enforcement theres no sense in 
reinventing the wheel

the slayings of three civil rights workers 
25 years ago focused national attention on mississippis segregated 
society and people here hope a special commemoration this week will 
highlight how it has changed 
from the beginning there was a realization that the eyes of 
this nation and of the world literally were going to turn to 
mississippi on june 21 said secretary of state dick molpus who 
has been active in planning the event 
we may never have another opportunity to show what the real 
mississippi is now he said 
on wednesday citizens of philadelphia miss and philadelphia 
pa will join for a series of events marking the 1964 murders of 
andrew goodman a 20yearold white new york resident james chaney 
a 21yearold black meridian resident and henry schwerner a 
24yearold white new yorker 
the three had been conducting a black voter registration drive 
when they left the site of a burned black church in neshoba county 
they were arrested on a traffic violation and taken to jail in 
philadelphia but were released and disappeared on june 21 1964 
their bodies were found 44 days later buried in an earthen dam 
twentyone whites were arrested in the shooting deaths murder 
charges were dropped in state court but seven men were later 
convicted for violating federal civil rights laws 
a fictionalized account of the murders and other events of the 
era were portrayed in the academy awardwinning movie mississippi 
burning the movies release late last year returned national 
attention to philadelphia 
some of us here deeply feel that there should be a 
commemorative for those boys said fenton deweese a member of the 
steering committee for the philadelphia to philadelphia project 
all they were trying to do was to get people to vote said 
deweese who is white thats such an american thing to do and for 
them to be killed for it you can see how ludicrous it was for 
people to be afraid 
i think their murders were a catalyst to the whole civil rights 
movement thats why its important that this be commemorated he 
said 
among the days scheduled events in philadelphia miss a town 
of about 6500 people are an ecumenical service at the mount zion 
united methodist church the church where goodman chaney and 
schwerner had been the night they disappeared a picnic and speeches 
also are planned 
family members and two other groups are planning a memorial 
caravan from philadelphia to washington and new york ending with a 
special observance at the cathedral of st john the divine in new 
york it will reverse the route of the three men to philadelphia 
about 60 miles northeast of jackson 
the people of philadelphia wanted to do like an ostrich just 
bury their heads in the sand and hope it would go away said ivory 
lyles who is black and chairman of the steering committee but 
the murders were a tremendous part of history and until you 
acknowledge a part of history and put it in its proper perspective 
youre going to be confronted with it 
some philadelphia residents were skeptical about the event at 
first lyles said but now it has the backing of the vast majority 
the real story in philadelphia miss is the number of local 
leaders that have moved behind this effort molpus said 
i hope it will show how the community 25 years later has tried 
to do some positive and constructive things by honoring the memory 
of those three civil rights workers and the principles they stood 
for said stanley dearman editor of the neshoba democrat a 
weekly newspaper and a steering committee member it shows what 
can be done and i hope it can spill over into other areas of 
community life 
but racism can still be found in the town deweese said 
if you want to go down the street and find somebody who will 
say nigger you can still find them he said you can find 
them in meridian you can find them in philadelphia pa theyre 
easy to find in a small town and i could point them out to you 
but you would be doing us a great disservice because they in no 
way represent the community

us officials say they will ask the soviets at 
talks that open monday to agree to test plans for verifying 
elimination of some weapons as a means of speeding up the proposed 
strategic arms reduction treaty 
the goal is not to delay the goal is to accelerate said a 
senior pentagon official he said unclear methods of verification 
had flawed some previous arms control pacts and delayed negotiation 
and eventual senate ratification of others 
instead of treating verification as the caboose on the train 
and treating it at the end or after the end during ratification 
debates i think that we will probably see an effort to bring that 
to a higher priority and get serious movement going on things that 
could substantially advance our ability to verify this agreement 
when it is done said the official speaking on condition that he 
not be further identified 
president bush has decided to make no dramatic changes in the 
us position in the start talks which resume in geneva on monday 
after a recess that began last november his spokesman said last 
week the treaty would eliminate 30 percent to 50 percent of 
longrange superpower nuclear weapons 
bush delayed reopening the talks pending completion of a 
strategic review a process that apparently yielded new ideas on 
verification 
the previous administration left an excellent foundation on 
which to build white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters friday saying there would be only relatively minor 
changes from the reagan administration 
but bush wants to take advantage of the new soviet openness to 
test methods of verifying cuts in some of the longrange ballistic 
missiles already agreed upon under the draft treaty said the 
pentagon official 
the official declined to disclose the exact nature of the 
contemplated tests but he said they would not include one proposed 
by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to verify the presence of 
nucleartipped cruise missiles aboard submarines 
the administration has endorsed objections by the us navy to 
gorbachevs proposal to ban that category of missiles an impasse 
that remains one of the major obstacles to completion of the treaty 
also unresolved is a us call for a ban on mobile missiles a 
class of weapon the soviets have deployed but the united states has 
not 
verifying numbers of mobile missiles on either side may be an 
unsolvable problem despite the use of satellites and onsite 
inspection said the pentagon official although he declined to 
specify whether the new us ideas attempted to resolve that issue 
the start process is basically a sound process a lot has been 
accomplished in these negotiations with the soviets we dont want 
to throw that away said the pentagon official 
even on a number of elements where we have achieved a 
surprising degree of agreement with the soviets there are some very 
big verification problems that we can see already said the 
official 
clearly one of the areas that has been the subject of the 
greatest attention is the subject of mobile icbms intercontinental 
ballistic missiles and what their place would be under the start 
agreement said the official 
the soviet union has deployed two mobile missile systems 
designated by the pentagon as the ss24 and ss25 whereas the 
united states has not developed one the administration has asked 
congress to approve the deployment of railbased mx missiles with 
10 warheads apiece and to fund development of the midgetman with 
one or two warheads apiece 
the biggest problems about mobiles are for verification and for 
breakout and until we see that solutions to those problems can be 
found then there are very strong arguments in favor of continuing 
the ban insisted on by president reagan the official said 
us officials will propose actually going out and doing some 
things that would give us the kind of knowledge on the basis of 
which we could say well it turns out we can verify this thing 
with greater confidence than we thought because there are certain 
things that we can observe that we didnt realize went along with 
that system said the official 
or alternatively we could say well it turns out that what we 
thought would be a sufficient level of inspection isnt good enough 
because when you get there there is a problem that we hadnt 
uncovered before 
we will have had the kind of experience that would allow us to 
say with a great deal more confidence how good our verification is 
and be able to improve it before we get to the end of the treaty 
instead of just having to find out afterward he said

americans are generating more than half a ton 
of garbage a year per person and a clear national policy is needed 
to deal with ways to dispose of it a congressional study says 
the study by the congressional office of technology assessment 
said that during the past decade the federal government has largely 
ignored the nations garbage problems focusing instead on the 
control of hazardous wastes 
today we find ourselves facing growing mounds of trash 
and many areas of the country are experiencing shortfalls of 
landfill capacity said the study 
the report said that more than 160 million tons of municipal 
solid waste are produced each year with 80 percent placed in 
landfills that are rapidly reaching capacity 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee said the study makes clear that our society 
must rapidly reduce the escalating generation of its garbage 
the age of disposables from diapers to fast food packaging is 
leaving our communities awash in a sea of garbage said dingell 
while the report encouraged the movement toward recycling many 
waste products and disposing of other wastes through burning it 
said neither of those two options are expected to eliminate the need 
for additional landfills 
the study suggested that in the years to come the federal 
government must play a greater part in dealing with the garbage 
problem now left mostly to state and local officials 
among the options outlined by the study is that the federal 
government establish a mechanism by which states could enter into 
agreements to deal with garbage disposal on a regional basis 
congress also could require states to ensure that adequate 
capacity for garbage disposal is available within their borders it 
also could direct the federal environmental protection agency to 
develop guidelines for locating landfills and help resolve local 
disputes over where landfills should be located said the report 
dealing with the nations garbage problems in the years to come 
will require strong federal leadership and congress has the 
opportunity to provide the basis for such leadership said the 
study

saturday 
the rallies are festivals of blaring music and joyous crowds lost 
in a sea of party flags and the smoke of exploding fireworks 
but many say the campaign has been the most invective since the 
return to democracy after the 196774 military dictatorship 
personal attacks have overshadowed political issues in greece 
which has the european economic communitys highest inflation at 14 
percent largest publicsector deficit and weakest currency 
mitsotakis supports a freemarket economy and papandreou portrays 
himself as a defender of the welfare state 
however elias tsotakos a financial consultant in athens said 
the business community believes there is not a great deal of 
difference between pasok and new democracy on major issues 
both will try to reduce the huge publicsector deficit keep 
interest rates up to reduce inflation reduce the foreign debt and 
both will try to deregulate banks and some financial services and 
privatize some public corporations he said 
papandreou came to power in 1981 promising to pull out of nato 
and the eec and to close us military bases in greece now he says 
the country benefits from the organizations and he is negotiating a 
new base agreement with the americans 
mitsotakis says he favors closer ties with the west and the eec 
and that nato and us bases in greece are vital to the countrys 
defense 
with few clear distinctions on political issues the campaign has 
become personal 
nude photographs of papandreous 35yearold fiancee dimitra 
liani became almost daily fixtures in opposition newspapers 
a progovernment newspaper published a photograph of a young 
mitsotakis flanked by two german soldiers the picture implied that 
the former resistance fighter twice arrested and sentenced to death 
by the germans collaborated with the nazis 
mitsotakis focused on multimilliondollar financial scandals that 
have led to the firing or resignation of eight members of 
papandreous government including deputy premier agamemnon 
koutsogiorgas papandreou denies wrongdoing

thailand the philippines and malaysia may 
benefit from the diversion of american and other foreign investment 
originally intended for the strifetorn chinese mainland prominent 
us foreign traders say 
those who have large investments in china are going to try to 
continue barring anything more cataclysmic but it is clear and 
logical that others are going to be very hesitant to make 
commitments until they see if this is the beginning of the end 
said thomas j white chairman of the asiapacific council of 
american chambers of commerce 
leaders of individual us chambers from east asia tended to 
agree they met reporters friday after the annual week of meetings 
in washington between asiabased american business executives and 
members of the us government and congress 
thailand the philippines and malaysia represent the next best 
alternative to china in terms of labor costs and business 
environment and because of their close association with potential 
investors white said 
offshore taiwan is not an alternative for the lowcost labor 
ventures attracted to the mainland said taiwanbased joseph 
coffman president of the american chamber of commerce in the 
republic of china 
even before trouble surfaced in china many overseas chinese 
entrepreneurs had switched to thailand malaysia and the philippines 
to take advantage of low labor costs he said 
if mainland officials ever get their act together the market 
potential is mindboggling a market of 450 million young people 
under 21 coffman said with such a market at stake you can 
understand the anxiety businessmen now feel 
for those already invested in china it certainly behooves them 
to try to derive something out of that investment he said but 
others would be well advised to wait and see coffman also said 
tremendous competition for foreign exchange among the different 
mainland regions and cities might make it possible to make secure 
investments in chinese locations distant from beijing 
bangkokbased jerry l loupee a vice chairman of the 
asiapacific council said the bush administration did the right 
thing in stopping short of breaking relations with china to protest 
the violent crackdown on beijings prodemocracy movement 
he voiced hope that china will get the message represented by 
other asian countries drawing away some of its investment and 
create secure conditions for business to continue 
white who is president of phelps dodge thailand a subsidiary of 
the us firm agreed urging that the united states coordinate 
chinese economic policy with its allies he said i hope we dont 
become the only nation blocking ourselves out of the market by 
taking sanctions and getting miles out in front of our competitors

color prints by mary stevenson cassatt will get 
their first major show at the national gallery of art beginning 
sunday 100 years after she started making them in france 
cassatts paintings are often exhibited but this will be the 
first comprehensive show to include all 23 of her color etchings 
they were made by drawing lines with a hardened point of metal or 
diamond on copper plates two or three plates to each picture 
she printed the final work from the plates on high quality paper 
often applying several colors of ink to a single plate 
the exhibit also includes prints made from the individual plates 
showing how the pictures developed 
born in 1844 cassatt took her first trip to france at the age of 
seven and settled there 20 years later her father was an investment 
banker once mayor of allegheny city pennsylvania though he at 
first opposed her career he and her mother later lived with her in 
paris and liked being part of the french art world 
the only american among the original french impressionists she 
was introduced to the group by the painter edgar degas she died in 
1926 at her home north of paris the chateau de beaufresne which 
she bought from her earnings as an artist 
cassatts interest in printmaking came from admiration for 
japanese etchers of the previous century especially kitagaro 
utamaro she collected their work and was especially impressed by an 
1890 exhibit in paris 
you must see the japanese come as soon as you can she 
wrote to berthe morisot another of the impressionist painters 
the centerpiece of this show a series of 10 prints on upper 
class womens life in paris derives from the japanese practice of 
producing this type of work in sets but instead of the japanese 
subjects often actors and prostitutes she favored pictures more 
acceptable for americans of the victorian era ladies taking tea 
writing a letter or sitting under a lamp 
a favorite subject of cassatts was a mother with a small child 
she never married or had children of her own 
the exhibit will be at the national gallerys east building until 
aug 27 it will go to the museum of fine arts in boston mass 
sept 9 to nov 5 and to the williams college museum of art 
williamstown mass nov 24 to jan 21 1990

joe rossetti has huge hands hands that 
have built houses run a business and for the past 13 years taken 
notes for his handicapped son so that he might graduate from college 
rossetti laughs when you mention his hands in the month since 
his sons graduation from providence college the 62yearold has 
been working on longneglected projects around the house ive got 
a blister he says with amazement ive never had such soft 
hands before 
rossetti calls his son carl his righthand man but the truth 
is thats what carl could call his father 
seventeen years ago when carl was 15 his neck was broken in a 
dirt bike accident 
after five months in a semicoma carl regained consciousness and 
was allowed to return home intensive therapy helped him regain 
movement on his left side and his father became his second hand 
ive never seen such devotion in a mother and father in my 
life said shirley kervick a dance therapist who helped carl 
regain his ability to walk 
carl finished high school with the help of teachers and fellow 
students then enrolled in providence colleges continuing education 
program 
rossetti whose 1951 providence college class ring is worn smooth 
from years of hard work went back to school with carl in 1975 
carl wanted that degree and i said well lets go for it 
rossetti said i did it like any parent would do it until youre 
a parent you dont realize what your parents did for you 
rossetti makes it clear he wasnt the only one who has helped 
carl 
behind the battles was my wife ann had to be very patient for 
the past 17 years rossetti said 
when carl was injured rossetti gave up his construction business 
and went into real estate i just stopped right then and there 
he said i had to let everything go 
as a parent you love your children nothing is a sacrifice if 
you love them he said 
carl took only one course per semester but rossetti also spent 
two days a week with him at the offices of doctors and therapists 
his next step in therapy involves improving his speech which only 
those who know him well can understand 
if you want to do it right its a fulltime job rossetti 
said i was just fortunate i could work my schedule around carl 
that meant sometimes working into the earlymorning hours to keep 
his family financially afloat 
its a good thing im a nocturnal person rossetti said as 
for sleep if i get three or four hours im great 
carls dedication to college was unfailing for 10 years but he 
expected to get everything back when he didnt he started to get 
frustrated rossetti said 
this is what i had to avoid i wanted to keep him busy he 
said the two have taken up sailing and have enrolled in a 
handicapped ski program theyve also seen a lot of movies 
rossetti said 
carl who received his bachelor of arts degree last month was 
the third rossetti child to graduate from providence college 
i think this graduation of carl rossetti is a testimony to what 
the human spirit can overcome said the dean of continuing 
education roger l pearson 
the college honored the elder rossetti with a special 
acknowledgement during the awards banquet for the graduates 
of all his childrens commencement ceremonies this was the 
hardest rossetti said i didnt want anything to go wrong he 
was worried about carl who still walks with a limp negotiating the 
stairs 
in the end i think i was as happy to graduate as he was he 
said 
now carl is looking to the future and says he can get a law 
degree in just three more years 
please give us a break his father pleads 
rossetti wants his son to manage a small shopping center complex 
he plans to build 
i said carl were going back to work and if you cant swing 
a hammer youd better grab a 2by4 youve got to put that 
education to work he said

the unrest in beijing has put the lives of tens of 
thousands of chinese students and scholars in this country in limbo 
and even the children of the elite fear they must turn away from 
their homeland 
if china becomes a democratic country i will go back said 
qian songnian a theoreticial physicist at dartmouth college but 
in this situation certainly not 
chinese students began arriving in the united states in small 
numbers in the years after president nixons visit to china the 
first large exchanges began in 1978 said huang zhengdong a yale 
university law student who heads a semiofficial organization of 
chinese students in the united states 
the figure of 40000 chinese students now in the united states is 
quoted by such groups as the returned student association in 
beijing but the us immigration and naturalization service said a 
recent computer check found 73000 chinese with active student visas 
the returned student association says there are an additional 
40000 chinese students in countries other than the united states 
the majority here are graduate students in science engineering 
and mathematics mostly at major universities and many are the sons 
and daugters of china leaders 
the number of student visas granted jumped from 17 in 1977 to 201 
in 1978 and has soared to 18000 new visas granted in fiscal 1988 
said spokeswoman frances jones of the state department which does 
not keep cumulative figures 
before 1980 the political requirements were so tight said 
huang their political backgrounds would be very clean they came 
from families that were not class enemies including families who 
fought for the communist revolution workers and peasants 
the political restrictions were eased after 1981 he said though 
a 1987 rule said they had to show they love the motherland and 
cherish socialism 
in practice huang said people who passed the academic 
examinations usually were allowed as long as their political 
qualifications were not that bad 
california universities are the top us draw with more than 
10000 chinese students followed by new york texas illinois and 
massachusetts according to the ins 
a total of 320000 chinese nationals are now in the united 
states ins spokesman greg leo said following the crackdown 
attorney general richard thornburgh announced that all will be 
permitted to stay for at least one year 
though the students here are among the best and the brightest of 
china few are sponsored by their government 
by one estimate only 2000 to 3000 students receive full 
government scholarships most graduate students are funded by their 
host universities at stanford university for example not one of 
the 150odd chinese students has a government subsidy said karlene 
dickey associate dean of graduate studies 
while official peoples republic of china media are condemning 
the outbreak of western bourgeois liberalism it has been 
fashionable for chinas elite to send its sons and daughters to 
study abroad where they are exposed to such ideas 
students and academics here said most exchange students are the 
children of party members professionals intellectuals teachers 
and technocrats children and grandchildren of politburo members are 
believed to be among them 
for those guys the front door and the back door were all 
open said huang 
a university of florida administrator added i dont ever 
recall coming across someone who said my parents are farmers 
richard downie who has worked with chinese students for nearly a 
decade at the universitys gainesville campus recalls one early 
group who pooled their money and bought a cadillac which they drove 
to canada during spring break 
i thought it was a great joke because here comes a group of 
people from communist china and the first thing they buy is the 
great symbol of american capitalism the cadillac downie said 
many of the students assume their government sends a few students 
to keep tabs on their classmates 
qian who arrived in 1981 said he believes a student in his 
dormitory at the university of maryland was an informer when a 
female classmate struck up a romance with a taiwanese she was 
summoned to the chinese embassy and reprimanded he said 
as students wrestle with whether to return home their 
governments scrutiny has taken on a more ominous tone 
huang said he saw someone videotaping the prodemocracy 
demonstration june 5 he helped organize in new york city he said he 
was warned through intermediaries not to go too far and his 
letters have arrived opened 
huang asked if he would return only laughed 
my picture and my image are on cnn and newspapers he said 
so certainly this is not the right time to go back

the divorce claim against actor william hurt by 
his former lover goes to court monday where she is asking for half 
of his earnings over the past 6 years even though she admits they 
were never formally married 
hurt who married someone else in march is estimated by the 
plantiffs lawyer to be worth about 10 million 
sandra jennings 32 is basing her claim on four weeks that she 
lived with hurt in beaufort sc while he was filming the big 
chill south carolina recognizes commonlaw marriages while new 
york where they lived most of the time does not 
this is a divorce action said jennings lawyer a richard 
golub i want to establish the marriage and then i think she 
should get half of everything he earned from 1982 to when they are 
divorced 
jennings a former dancer at the new york city ballet said hurt 
39 treated her and introduced her to others as his wife but 
the judge who is hearing the case beginning monday has already said 
that the burden of proving that there was a commonlaw marriage 
based on south carolina law will be difficult 
hurts lawyer frances jacobs would not comment referring 
questions to publicist lois smith who denied a commonlaw marriage 
existed hurt never claimed or pretended they were married she 
said 
hurt who also has starred in kiss of the spider woman 
broadcast news gorky park and the accidental tourist 
lived with jennings for several months in south carolina while 
shooting the big chill jennings says for most of that time he 
was still married to actress mary beth hurt 
the actress divorced hurt on dec 3 1982 after seven years of 
marriage hurt learned of it on dec 9 jennings is basing her 
marriage claim on the period from dec 9 to jan 10 1983 the day 
they left beaufort at the time jennings says she was pregnant 
with hurts son 
jennings said she gave birth to alexander devon hurt now 6 
because she thought her relationship with hurt was permanent in 
court papers she said she left hurt in 1984 because he was 
physically and verbally abusive claiming he once slapped her while 
she held their then5dayold son on another occasion after a 
drinking binge she says he urinated on their couch 
smith said hurt was treated for alcohol abuse at the betty ford 
clinic and has been a member of alcoholics anonymous for about 2 
years she denied that hurt ever hit jennings 
jennings aborted two pregnancies before giving birth to alex 
golub told state supreme court justice jacqueline silbermann at a 
recent hearing 
hurt acknowledged he is alexs father and has been giving 
jennings 65000 a year for support smith said 
jennings sued last year to get 16000 a month claiming she and 
her child were living in near poverty she later decided to argue 
that a legal marriage existed under south carolina law 
until the marriage issue can be decided silbermann refused to 
give jennings temporary alimony or child support ruling that 
65000 a year seemed adequate 
silbermann also noted that south carolina does not automatically 
regard two people living together as having a commonlaw marriage 
especially where one of them is already married 
she said that if the relationship was illicit at its inception 
the law presumes the relationship retains its illicit character the 
person who claims a commonlaw marriage exists must prove it 
silbermann said 
the evidence is therefore thin complicating a heavy burden of 
proof under south carolina law the judge said 
golub says he intends to call hurt as his first witness monday 
when the hearing starts on whether the actor and jennings are 
married 
hurt moved actress marlee matlin his costar in children of a 
lesser god into his manhattan apartment in november 1985 and 
jennings said in court papers that this caused her great emotional 
distress she said her name was still on the apartment mailbox at 
the time 
hurt married heidi henderson band leader skitch hendersons 
daughter in march 
golubs position is that the blond bespectacled hurt is a 
bigamist because he got married while he is already married to my 
client

soviet dissident sergei grigoryants 
awardwinning editor of the liberal journal glasnost says he has 
launched an independent daily news service to carry soviet news to 
western europe and the united states 
grigoryants on his first visit to the united states discussed 
the service friday at a reception by the private human rights group 
freedom house a partner in the venture grigoryants said he will 
sign an agreement with the with the organization monday but that 
many details have yet to be worked out 
daily glasnost an offshoot of the magazine in which grigoryants 
has tested the limits of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
openness campaign would be the latest in a number of soviet 
publications trying to go beyond official dispatches about soviet 
events 
recently efforts have been made to backtrack in all spheres 
economic and certainly of course in the nationalities question 
to maintain stability and to keep receiving western credits 
grigoryants said in an interview 
the nationalities question refers to the ethnic and religious 
unrest that has struck several of the soviet unions republics in 
recent months an april 19 attack by authorities on georgian 
demonstrators left 20 dead threatening to set back soviet efforts 
to put aside human rights as an issue in dealings with the west 
there is very little time to achieve something before the 
situation in the soviet union becomes worse grigoryants said 
essentially thats what were all doing 
several unofficial publications are distributed in the west 
including grigoryants glasnost and a daily digest of stories 
appearing in the dissident journal expresskhonrika 
glasnost has been translated and distributed in the west since 
its inception two years ago the englishlanguage version is 
translated and distributed by the new yorkbased center for 
democracy 
the soviet governments dissemination of news worldwide is 
dominated by the official news agency tass and by broadcasts of 
radio moscow in addition to the main communist party and government 
newspapers 
grigoryants said his editors already have begun sending daily 
glasnost installments in russian by telephone facsimile machines to 
paris where they are translated into french and spanish for 
distribution to newspapers he said the service will be expanded 
with transmissions to new york for translation into english but he 
wasnt sure when 
the plans come despite what grigoryants who has served several 
jail terms for his activitism called the soviet authorities 
constant harassment of his magazine last week he was given the 
international federation of newspaper publishers 1989 golden pen of 
freedom award for his work on the magazine 
in april 1988 agents of the kgb state security agency and the 
interior ministry raided his suburban moscow apartment where the 
journal is published and confiscated a donated computer files 
printing equipment and hundreds of copies of the magazine ready for 
distribution he said they have not been returned 
they even took my english pipe said the 48yearold editor

sears has said it will announce by the end of the month whether

thousands of afghan soldiers captured a 
strategic city near jalalabad and killed more than 200 guerrillas in 
a major offensive involving artillery and air support the 
government said saturday 
our troops are in complete control not only of jalalabad but 
also of areas beyond the city and we are pushing the enemy toward 
pakistan mohammad nabi amani spokesman for the foreign ministry 
told reporters 
amani said the recently completed offensive by 10000 government 
troops captured the city of khushgumbad 20 miles east of jalalabad 
our victory is very crucial because we have an important airport 
at khushgumbad 
the city of 30000 was considered a guerrilla stronghold 
the eastern city of jalalabad was the guerrillas first major 
target after soviet troops completed their withdrawal feb 15 from 
afghanistan the rebels predicted a quick victory but a stalemate 
occurred soon after the battle began three months ago 
we are no more just defending positions we are now on the 
offensive amani said the areas are not only under our control 
but we are setting up permanent military posts 
president najib has called on the united states and pakistan 
which support the guerrillas to press for a negotiated settlement 
to the war which najib says the guerrillas are incapable of 
winning the insurgents control much of afghanistans countryside 
but have been unable to take major cities 
the staterun bakhtar news ageny said 229 guerrillas were killed 
and 150 wounded in the offensive it said 86 rocket launchers and 
18200 machinegun cartridges were captured the report did not 
mention government casualties 
it was not immediately possible to verify the governments claims 
an asian diplomat who monitors military developments in 
afghanistan said such a victory would be a major blow to the 
insurgents 
jalalabad was the prestige battle and if the government is now 
saying it is pushing the rebels further east it is a big blow to the 
insurgents said the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity

the government is working overtime to condemn 
liberal political thought but there has been no hint the campaign 
will widen to take on what conservatives have called western 
spiritual pollution such as sidewalk pool tables privately owned 
bars and miniskirts 
the military attack on student prodemocracy protesters and their 
supporters this month has been followed by more than 1200 arrests 
and an intense media campaign condemning any suggestion that the 
power of the ruling communist party be limited 
political purges are expected starting with party general 
secretary zhao ziyang who reportedly has been stripped of his power 
so far the cultural and economic aspects of western culture have 
escaped attack 
the crackdown seems likely to increase the great divide between 
the economic sphere where selected western methods are studied and 
adopted and the political sphere where western philosophy is taboo 
industrialist lee iacoccas autobiography is acceptable for 
example but not the declaration of independence 
for a government based on marxs tenet that economics determines 
everything else about a society it is an interesting and 
tensionridden division 
this division is at the heart of conflict between senior leader 
deng xiaoping on the one hand and dissident fang lizhi and the 
student protesters on the other 
for more than a decade deng has sought to shake up an economy 
devastated by collectivization political battles and an economic 
planning system that discouraged initiative and bailed out failing 
factories in economics deng said pragmatism is best black cat 
white cat it doesnt matter as long as it catches mice 
but deng always stressed the complete authority of the communist 
party two previous efforts to achieve a democratic breakthrough 
through public outcry the 197879 democracy wall movement and 
198687 nationwide student marches were put down with arrests and 
purges 
fang who has taken refuge with his wife in the us embassy in 
beijing won a wide following among fellow intellectuals for arguing 
that economic and political reforms cannot be divorced 
although there is no evidence fang encouraged the student 
protesters in their spring campaign as the government charged they 
echoed his position many economic problems they said such as 
inflation and shortages were linked to official corruption and a 
controlled press that dared not expose it 
many students praised the example of the soviet union where 
president mikhail s gorbachev has allowed a relative ferment of 
political debate 
if the students had been willing to make their suggestions to 
governmentsponsored youth groups and student unions there might 
have been no great stir 
but they rejected the official bodies as not representing them 
and demanded a direct say their stance implicitly challenged the 
ability of the party to represent them as well this it appears 
was going too far 
many intellectuals had hoped chinas economic reforms would carry 
over to the political system regardless of dengs intentions in 
the six months before the protests began some thought this was 
happening 
small groups of intellectuals held salons to read poetry and 
discuss democracy national television broadcast a lengthy series 
that criticized chinas traditional culture as backward and 
although vice president wang zhen denounced it the authors were not 
punished greater daring was allowed in art and film 
these developments may have angered aging leaders including deng 
one western diplomat said the start of the student protests in 
midapril may have been seized on by the conservatives as an 
opportunity to embarrass relative liberals such as zhao 
the movement for greater political reform flagged several times 
over its sevenweek span but the government passed repeated chances 
to end it peacefully 
instead according to this theory it waited until sympathetic 
teachers researchers government workers and even soldiers were 
infected with the students enthusiasm and joined in marches 
revealing their true thinking then it condemned the protests as 
counterrevolutionary and ordered the army to put them down 
if this theory holds purges of intellectuals and government 
workers can be expected to be fairly extensive on the other hand 
the leadership has a stake in restoring normal production as soon as 
possible and heavy purges would make this difficult 
regardless of how many people are purged chinese interviewed 
since the crackdown predicted more protests for democracy within a 
few years 
one explained deng believes he can open a window to the outside 
and put up a screen to keep out the flies but even the air from 
outside is infected with democracy

ice fell from a commercial plane and slammed into another baseball 
diamond in the same area near winnipeg international airport 
that chunk of debris landed near some children 
they say lightning doesnt strike in the same place twice but 
i guess in this case it did airport manager george elliot said 
friday 
the luggage and parachute fell from one of two f4 phantom jets 
that were leaving winnipeg on their way to duluth minn 
the planes were from the george air force base in victorville 
calif and were en route home after taking part in a training 
exercise in winnipeg

nelson bunker hunt and william herbert hunt have 
their famous fathers penchant for vagueness and nonchalance about 
their fortunes as bunker once said people who know how much they 
are worth generally arent worth very much 
the brothers have been forced to find out how much theyre worth 
its a lot less than it once was but still amounts to hundreds of 
millions of dollars spread around the world according to documents 
filed in us bankruptcy court last week 
theres a 19 million coin collection a 2 millionacre 
australian ranch and a nineacre plot in north texas a 
2700yearold vase and a dallas bowling alley 
the documents detail the riches still controlled by two of hl 
hunts eight children the others are not party to these bankruptcy 
cases the first involving the hunts personal as opposed to 
corporate finances after the decline in energy prices herberts 
and bunkers silver speculation in 1979 and 1980 and mammoth claims 
by the internal revenue service 
there is little question the brothers were once billionaires one 
1980 estimate placed bunkers worth at 234 billion and herberts 
at 152 billion now bunkers filing says his assets amount to 
25883 million herberts 16938 million 
those figures are far short of the claims against the hunts the 
irs alone wants 73042 million from bunker and 31731 million from 
herbert for back taxes and interest in all bunkers debts top 15 
billion and herberts are almost 12 billion 
both brothers dispute they owe the money but last september they 
and their wives filed for protection from creditors the case is 
moving through us bankruptcy judge harold abramsons court and 
likely will end with liquidation of much of their holdings 
the documents show a picture of secondgeneration wealth 
although still built on their fathers oil and gas holdings it has 
spread to cover the largest tract of land in northern australia 
thoroughbred race horses large pieces of valuable land in 
california arizona and alaska and coins and other rare artifacts 
missing is any mention of pure silver though government 
investigators claim the brothers came within weeks of cornering the 
worlds silver market 
while the documents attempt to set out what the brothers own 
they caution valuation of such complex and varied assets raises 
difficult issues upon which reasonable minds can differ 
bunker 63 always has been the bigger of the two brothers both 
physically and monetarily 
his collection of more than 10000 ancient islamic roman and 
greek coins is called the largest and most valuable privately held 
collection of ancient coins in the world 
the collection which sits in vaults at sothebys is worth an 
estimated 19 million bunker also has a collection of 16 vases 
from 2700 to 2500 years old on exhibit at fort worths kimbell 
art museum 
the contribution of herbert 60 to that exhibit consists of 38 
ancient bronze statues and artifacts valued at about 35 million 
dating from the eighth century to third century bc 
one of bunkers companies is bluegrass farm sales inc which 
owns and leases 2 million acres of australian farm and ranch land 
with an estimated value of 175 million 
theres also a 81290acre ranch that sprawls across six counties 
in southeastern oklahoma valued at 1126 million and a 9012acre 
ranch worth about 1805 million that straddles the 
tennesseemississippi state line 
including his 18 million home in suburban dallas and 250000 
condominium in hawaii his real estate holdings come to 13788 
million and are located in seven states 
theres also 2353 million in oil and gas properties 1129 
million of livestock and thoroughbred race horses and 5295 million 
of other investments including a 1 million onethird share of 
bronco bowl a 72lane dallas bowling alley herbert and brother 
lamar hunt split the other twothirds 
herbert owns a byzantine coin collection that he values at 2 
million but it might fetch only 1 million if liquidated because of 
the limited number of collectors of byzantine coins the document 
notes 
most of herberts real estate holdings are contained in 
partnerships with family members and longtime business associate a 
paul stephens herberts various partnerships with stephens are 
valued at 6684 million and mostly involve paloma corp 
developments in the phoenix area 
herberts house located in university park a suburb surrounded 
by dallas is valued at 125 million he also owns a 200000 half 
interest in a house in the resort of vail colo 
his oil and gas properties are worth an estimated 7755 million 
other real estate is valued at 2323 million and various other 
holdings worth about 235 million including a 10 silver churchill 
commemorative coin and a 200 gold coin money clip

statewide office 
ms brown whose father and brother were both governors said 
friday she will quit her post as a local public works commissioner 
next month to step up her campaign for state treasurer 
one of the things that i think modern campaigns lack is the 
ability to touch people and to listen to people and to find out what 
it is that they see as the priorities in sacramento the 
42yearold democrat said 
it seems everywhere i go there are people there to tell me they 
were touched by some positive activity of my fathers or my 
brothers administration she said her father edmund g pat 
brown sr was governor from 1959 to 1966 and her brother edmund 
g jr known as jerry was governor from 1975 to 1983 
ms brown who has campaigned parttime during the past six 
months for the post held by republican incumbent thomas w hayes is 
the only major democratic candidate for the job to emerge so far

john williams who took over as pops conductor in 1980 after the

i dont think its complacent to point out that the popularity 
of the pops does not seem to have diminished at all he said 
but he stressed that the orchestra must keep up the search for 
a new repertoire finding new things discarding things that no

downs syndrome has been linked to a 
defect on a tiny slice of one of the human chromosomes an important 
step toward prevention and treatment of the disorder researchers 
said saturday 
in a separate report researchers also reported progress in 
narrowing the search for the defect responsible for one relatively 
uncommon form of alzheimers disease 
in a week of intensive meetings and reviews of scientific 
reports about 700 researchers from around the world announced the 
genetic mapping of about 400 new genes 53 of them linked to 
specific diseases 
the reports were presented at the tenth international workshop on 
human gene mapping held at yale university 
the process of gene mapping in which researchers determine where 
a particular gene lies on the 23 pairs of human chromosomes is a 
necessary step toward isolating a gene and determining its role in 
human health 
by mapping it you can find it isolate it and develop new 
means of therapy said dr frank ruddle of yale university one of 
the organizers of the conference 
such mapping helps doctors understand human genes in much the 
same way that road maps aid the understanding of places 
people unfamiliar with new york city for example may not have 
any idea what fortysecond street is like until times square is 
mapped onto it in the same way researchers have mapped the 
downs syndrome defect to a very narrow region on human chromosome 
21 
at the ninth international gene mapping workshop two years ago in 
paris scientists had mapped about 1000 human genes 
by last week the total had climbed to about 1550 the 
announcement of 400 new ones saturday brings the total to nearly 
2000 an increase of more than onefourth over what it was a week 
ago 
the number of mapped genes has doubled every two years since 
1973 said ruddle if that rate of progress continues the entire 
human complement of perhaps 50000 to 100000 genes should be mapped 
by the end of the century 
one example of what gene mapping can lead to is the spectacular 
recent progress in understanding the most common form of muscular 
dystrophy 
until that was done the cause of the disease was a mystery 
researchers mapped the gene isolated it and determined how it was 
put together 
that gave them a good idea of the kind of protein that might be 
related to it they searched for the protein found it and 
determined that people with muscular dystrophy were missing a 
working version of it 
the mystery is solved and new treatments are already being 
developed as a result said ruddle 
downs syndrome marked by low iq and facial abnormalities is 
one of the most common genetic ailments it occurs in people who 
mistakenly have an extra copy of chromosome 21 
researchers reported saturday that the condition is related to a 
tiny portion of that chromosome that could contain no more than a 
few thousand genes probably fewer 
they can now begin to search that region for the precise genes 
responsible for the condition 
the work that led to the mapping of downs syndrome to that tiny 
region was done mostly by dr pierremarie sinet of the necker 
hospital for sick children in paris and dr julie korenberg of the 
cedarssinai medical center in los angeles 
researchers have also determined that one uncommon form of 
alzheimers disease is related to a defect on chromosome 21 they 
reported at the workshop that they have narrowed the location to one 
of two small regions on the chromosome 
studies of six individuals with unusual abnormalities on 
chromosome 21 should soon show which of those regions is the right 
one said ben carritt a geneticist with the medical research 
council in london 
the form of alzheimers involved is one that runs in families it 
is called earlyonset familial alzheimers disease 
doctors do not know whether it has any connection with the much 
more common form of alzheimers disease that does not clearly run in 
families and occurs at a later age carritt said

gov michael dukakis has proposed deporting the 
illegal aliens now in massachusetts prisons as a measure to relieve 
overcrowding while saving money 
if we can deport them were going to deport them dukakis 
said friday i dont see any reason why the people of this state 
ought to be supporting folks who are here illegally in the first 
place 
state secretary of human services philip johnston who oversees 
the state corrections system said we want to try to deport as 
many of these people as possible well even pay their airfare 
state prisons and county jails are overflowing with nearly 13000 
inmates in facilities designed to hold 7100 inmates are doubling 
and even tripling up in cells and are even sleeping in hallways 
boiler rooms and recreation rooms 
ins boston district director charles cobb welcomed dukakis 
interest in deporting illegal aliens and said the us government 
can pay their outbound plane fare we have money to move people 
cobb said 
in the past the ins waited for jailed illegal immigrants to 
complete their sentences before starting the deportation process 
but in january they stopped waiting and now proceed with the hope 
that inmates can be deported when they get out of prison 
immigrants comprise 10 percent of the states criminal inmate 
population and as many as 80 percent of them could be deported for 
being in this country illegally according to estimates from the 
federal immigration and naturalization service 
the governor and i both view this as a top priority johnston 
said we want to move quickly to work with ins to deport as many 
people as possible consistent with public safety 
he also noted the potential cost saving the state spends about 
30000 to house each inmate creating a new prison bed costs 
100000 
if illegal aliens are deported johnston said we can save 
ourselves two or three new braintrees referring to the 
controversial 500bed prison planned for that town

the defense forces on saturday 
rejected a role in a threeway dialogue with opposition and 
government political parties on panamas election crisis 
the proposal was made by a delegation from the organization of 
american states which was sent to panama after the government 
voided the may 7 presidential election 
international observers say the opposition won the vote by a 31 
margin 
the opposition seeks the resignation of gen manuel antonio 
noriega head of the defense forces and panamas de facto ruler 
noriega said in may he would not negotiate with the opposition 
noriegas spokesman renato pereira reiterated that stance to 
reporters saturday he said the defense forces would support 
negotiations between the various political parties but that it would 
not take part 
pereira said the opposition wants the military to participate 
in order to demand that it capitulate but the military will not 
capitulate to politicians 
the fate of the military and of noriega are not subjects for 
negotiation he said 
the opposition on friday agreed to the oas proposal and said it 
looked forward to negotiating a transfer of power on sept 1 the 
constitutional inauguration day 
the government parties have said they are willing to negotiate 
with the opposition but have not said if they would join a threeway 
dialogue that includes the defense forces 
the opposition has been seeking noriegas ouster for more than a 
year the united states has supported the ouster effort with 
economic sanctions against panama 
it has also indicted noriega on drug trafficking charges 
noriega says the federal indictments are a part of a us plan to 
renege on the 1977 treaties that cede control of the panama canal to 
panama at the end of the century

harrods made it official saturday even when its 
hot outside skimpily dressed shoppers are not welcome at the 
elegant emporium 
britains bestknown department store defended its new cover up 
or keep out order saying shoppers should not dress like 
beachgoers 
when you come shopping at the best store in the world you 
should be wearing something suitable not something more appropriate 
to the beach said a harrods spokesman speaking anonymously 
as temperatures soared to an unseasonably hot 81 degrees 
customers wearing revealing outfits were being shown the door on the 
instructions of mohamed al fayed chairman of house of fraser which 
owns the knightsbridge store 
in the kind of temperatures we have been experiencing lately 
people have been going just too far in their skimpy shorts and 
tshirts the spokesman said we have always had a dress code 
but we now feel the need to redefine it mr al fayed has made a 
personal decision on this and requests customers to wear suitable 
attire for the store 
people wearing shortshorts tops that reveal too much and 
cutoff tatty jeans will be kept out the spokesman said but 
tailored or bermuda shorts are fine very fashionable this summer 
and which we sell in the store anyway 
staff at all 11 entrances to harrods are under orders to inspect 
the clothing of every shopper 
if a customer fails to come up to scratch he or she would 
politely but firmly be denied entry the spokesman said 
the spokesman said some customers were not terribly happy when 
turned away but in the main everyone has accepted the situation 
music teacher john locke 29 was quoted in the tabloid today as 
saying he was barred from the store by a doorman i was told i was 
wearing football soccer shorts its an infantile policy he

led by a black nun with cancer the 
nations roman catholic bishops saturday linked arms and sang we 
shall overcome before agreeing to seek ways to give blacks a 
greater role in the church 
the national conference of catholic bishops also passed a 
resolution urging normalization of us relations with vietnam and 
approved a plan for resolving disputes between bishops and 
theologians 
tears streamed down the faces of some bishops as they listened to 
sister thea bowman of canton miss who pleaded for the church to 
be more sensitive to the needs of black catholics 
the number of black catholics in the united states has grown from 
900000 to 2 million in the past 20 years partly helped by 
immigration from haiti and the west indies there are 53 million 
american catholics 
only 13 of the churchs 300 bishops are black in addition there 
are 1100 predominantly black parishes in the nation but only 75 of 
the approximately 300 black priests are pastors of black churches 
sister bowman who works at the institute of black studies at 
xavier university in new orleans said too many white priests work 
for the people but have not learned to share life and love they 
insulate themselves because they dont feel comfortable with black 
people 
the bishops conference voted to refer a proposed document from 
the bishops committee on black catholics to its administrative 
board the document urges greater representation of blacks 
throughout the church and integration of africanamerican cultural 
symbols into local parishes and liturgies 
in the document titled here i am send me the nations 13 
black prelates say the nation and church are still burdened with 
racism and there has been a serious attrition of blacks from the 
church to protestant denominations where they feel more at home 
auxiliary bishop moses b anderson of detroit a black prelate 
said it is good for catholics to hear church leaders discuss ways to 
celebrate black culture 
auxiliary bishop john h ricard of baltimore chairman of the 
black catholics committee said the finished document likely will be 
brought before the bishops at their november meeting 
on the vietnam issue the bishops approved a statement asking the 
nation to begin to heal the wounds caused by the vietnam war and 
resume diplomatic relations with its former enemy 
the united states government must move beyond hostility and 
adopt a traditional american response to the needs of desperate and 
hungry people the bishops said 
the committee which visited vietnam in january said the call to 
normalize relations does not indicate approval of the communist 
regime but could serve as a means to provide humanitarian 
assistance and more effectively lobby for improvements in human 
rights and religious liberty for the vietnamese 
bishop joseph j madera of fresno calif who said the brother 
of a priest in his diocese is one of 10 imprisoned priests in 
vietnam expressed concerns that the church would be granting 
legitimacy to a barbaric regime 
in other business the bishops voted 2149 to approve a document 
on doctrinal responsibilities recommending ways for bishops and 
theologians to resolve disputes through dialogues 
the document first presented before the bishops conference in 
november 1987 drew initial criticism for appearing to place bishops 
and theologians on an equal level 
but much of the criticism was deflected after the document was 
changed to emphasize the bishops role as the final arbiter of 
doctrinal disputes 
its primarily a call to civility and charity i dont feel 
bound by it in any way said cardinal john oconnor on new york 
the bishops planned to attend mass together sunday and meet in 
executive session at the end of their fourday meeting monday

house republican leader robert michel keeps a 
videotape in his office of the house proceedings on oct 29 1987 
the day speaker jim wright stretched the rules to snatch a rare 
legislative victory from the gop 
once in a while it is brought out and replayed as a reminder of 
the indignities house republicans suffer as their 35year minority 
status continues it is a condition that has never been as wearisome 
as during wrights tenure these past 2 years and michel by 
personality a quiet gentlemanly legislator has been forced to 
learn some new tactics 
the transformation was most noticeably on display the day wright 
stepped down as speaker addressing the house on an occasion that 
seemed made for conciliation and courtesy michel instead turned 
critical 
the distinguished members of the committee on ethics are 
neither mindless nor cannibals he said in rebuttal to wrights 
resignation speech a week before 
i am all for putting an end to bitterness i am all in favor of 
putting our house in order but we do not do so by sweeping things 
under the rug 
he also observed that thirtyfive years of uninterrupted power 
can act like a corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and 
comity those who have been kings of the hill for so long may forget 
that majority status is not a divine right 
michels more partisan demeanor has prompted criticism from 
democrats and the attention of republicans 
its there and there isnt any room to argue about whether bob 
is more partisan says rep edward madigan a fellow illinois 
republican who shares michels preference for reasoned discourse 
over confrontation 
while michel said later he was simply stating what had to be 
said his remarks angered many democrats who saw it as kicking 
wright while he was down 
what he said was beneath him said rep david bonior of 
michigan no 4 in the house democratic leadership hierarchy i 
think he knows deep down it was inappropriate 
michels approach to leading his republican cadre also has 
changed for another reason changes in the makeup of the 175member 
gop conference itself an influx of younger members elected since 
1982 has brought a growing disaffection with compromise and a 
proclivity for more rhetorical bombthrowing 
many democrats believe michels occasional forays into hardball 
politics are a reflection of that newer group epitomized by rep 
newt gingrich rga the man who contributed mightily to bringing 
down wright and who was elected the partys no 2 leader this year 
michels comments when he handed the house gavel over to new 
speaker tom foley fits right in with the markup of gingrichs 
attacks bonior said it meshes comfortably with the rhetoric of 
the far republican right 
it was indicative of the embattled bob michel as opposed to the 
one of the past who was consensus building said rep tony coelho 
of california who was no 3 in the democratic leadership before 
giving up his house seat because of questions about a junk bond 
deal it was a bob michel who was looking behind his back the 
division that exists on their side is quite severe and he senses 
it feels it and reacts to it all the time 
whether things will change with the ascension of foley remains to 
be seen 
i wouldnt want to predict that michel said it gives us 
an opportunity for a fresh start and im going to try and make the 
most of it 
bonior was less sanguine this kind of internecine warfare 
could continue to go on for the rest of this congress he said 
the leader has to more or less reflect the spirit the 
attitudes the values of his troops said republican rep henry 
hyde another illinoisan we saw jim wright move to the left as he 
ascended the ladder of leadership tom foley has done the same and 
the republicans have become more militant in the past four years 
because of abuses of power by the democrats 
foley in an interview last week after his election to the 
speakership acknowledged without naming wright that democrats 
had at times overplayed their majority privileges 
he singled out the 1987 vote on a budget bill when wright 
created two legislative days out of one and held open a rollcall 
long enough for one democrat to change his vote and provide the 
winning margin i think we went too far on that day he said 
and promised an end to such overreaching 
the deterioration of house comity dates to 1985 when democrats 
denied a house seat to republican richard mcintyre of indiana in a 
disputed close election the 1987 budget vote added fuel to the 
fire as did later clashes over aid to the nicaraguan contras and 
wrights alleged disclosure of a cia covert operation in nicaragua 
in the latter case michel shocked some republicans by joining 
rep dick cheney rwyo in filing a formal ethics complaint 
against wright 
on contra aid michel felt he had been cheated out of the right 
in march 1988 to a vote on a gop alternative we were promised a 
fair shot at a substitute we got a shot all right a shot in the 
head he said in a statement he later added in over 30 years 
as a member of this institution i have kept my word i expect 
others to do the same 
if wright had treated republicans more evenhandedly like 
former speakers carl albert or tip oneill you would not see this 
significant change in bob michels behavior madigan said

sen pete wilson said saturday that maintaining 
businessasusual with chinas repressive regime is intolerable 
and called for revocation of that countrys favored trading status 
with the united states 
the united states must be a moral leader the california 
republican said in an appearance on cnns newsmaker saturday 
i think weve got to do that with some concrete tangible 
means 
he expressed dismay at president bushs reluctance to go beyond a 
cutoff of military sales in protesting the beijing governments 
crackdown on prodemocracy students and other dissidents 
wilson said he will offer a nonbinding resolution on monday 
calling for revocation of chinas mostfavorednation trading status 
trading partners with that status are guaranteed trade relations 
with the united states that are as favorable as any those of any 
other nation 
although such a resolution is nonbinding wilson said it is 
important to put congress on record against the chinese regimes 
bloody repression of the prodemocracy movement its massacre of 
peaceful demonstrators near tiananmen square and its continued 
campaign to arrest and denounce the dissidents 
the united states is the largest direct investor in the 
peoples republic of china wilson said the hope is that a 
more moderate leadership takes over but one can assist that to come 
about 
he said the united states brought trade pressures against the 
soviet union to press for human rights reforms and should do so with 
china 
wilson complained about reports that business representatives 
particularly from japan are returning to china in spite of the 
crackdown 
business as usual its intolerable wilson said it ought 
to be condemned 
but a former ambassador to china winston lord echoed bush in 
saying that trade trade sanctions often hurt the people instead 
of the government 
calling the question one over which reasonable people can 
disagree lord said on the same program that it would not be in 
americas best interest to dismantle accords legislation and 
blueprints of an economic relationship that have taken years to 
build 
lord argued that ultimately the aged chinese leaders now in 
charge of the repression will pass away and the united states will 
want to maintain its economic and trade ties for that moment 
the former ambassador who was in china in february when bush 
visited beijing applauded the presidents approach and said the 
administrations rhetoric should continue to be strong

as sales of washington apples hit their 
lowest point of an alarplagued year some growers are considering 
giving away fruit to the poor as a way to reduce supplies and raise 
prices 
one proposal includes taking a truckload of washington apples to 
new york city and giving them away to show how desperate the 
situation is said jim clements of selah president of the 
washington association of apple growers 
the financial carnage taking place now is beyond what the 
consumer can understand clements said friday 
the drop in sales and prices was triggered when a private 
consumer group issued a report in february contending that eating 
alartreated apples increased cancer risk in children 
about the same time the federal environmental protection agency 
said that it was considering banning the chemical starting next year 
because of a slight risk but that the risk was not enough to 
warrant emergency action or consumer concern 
alar spurs even growth in apples improves their appearance and 
gives them longer shelf life its use has dropped steadily in recent 
years as questions have been raised about its safety and after the 
most recent publicity its maker said it would be taken off the us 
market 
meanwhile the apple growers association is running an 
advertisement in papers sunday asking growers if they are interested 
in diverting all or part of their apples away from the marketplace 
as a way to raise wholesale prices to the breakeven point 
clements said the apples could be given to poor people churches 
or social service organizations rather than sold at a loss to 
retailers who clements contends are making large profits at the 
expense of growers 
growers accuse retailers of failing to cut supermarket prices in 
the wake of the plunging wholesale apple prices thus holding down 
consumer sales 
its flat crazy said grower rob valicoff saying that 
everyone but growers are making a profit off the crop 
retailers should be reducing their prices to sell more apples as 
a sign of support for the battered growers they contend 
the ad also asks growers if they are interested in pledging 
financial support to explore a lawsuit against those who helped 
trigger the alar controversy that would include the natural 
resources defense council which issued the disputed report and the 
cbs television program 60 minutes which gave the report what 
growers feel was unbalanced publicity 
the association which has 300 growermembers is asking for 
mailed responses to gauge the mood of the states 5000 growers and 
has not decided on any course of action clements said 
but the proposed actions are an indication of the desperation in 
this region that produces half the nations apples 
sales last week plunged to their lowest point of the year and 
prices sank further below the cost of production adding to the 
previous estimates of 100 million in losses for apple growers 
nationally as a result of the alar scare 
outofstate shipments fell to 843000 boxes 15 percent less 
than the week before and 32 percent less than for the same period 
last year according to the wenatchee valley traffic association 
wholesale prices dropped to 8 or less per 42pound box for the 
top grade of red delicious apples up to 4 less than last year and 
at least 2 below the cost of production according to market news 
service

syrian gunners fired 150 howitzer shells 
into the three main ports north of beirut on saturday and clashed 
with christian forces along beiruts dividing green line police 
said one civilian died 
there were no casualties in the barrage on the jounieh tabarja 
and byblos ports through which food fuel and occasionally weapons 
are smuggled into the 310squaremile christian enclave police said 
in christian east beirut a man was killed by sniper fire they 
said 
that brought the toll to 373 people killed and 1450 wounded 
since clashes broke out march 8 between gen michel aouns mainly 
christian troops and the allied syrian and lebanese druse forces 
last week syrian gunners attacked an oil tanker and three boats 
carrying food and gasoline to the christian enclave in response 
aoun said friday he would attack the network of roads along which 
the syrians bring in supplies from damascus the syrian capital 
aoun did not say how he would carry out attacks on the roads 
which would be a dramatic escalation of the 3monthold 
confrontation 
meanwhile newspapers in lebanon on saturday warned of an 
escalation in fighting which began when aoun blockaded illegal 
militiarun ports that he said deprived the state treasury of 100 
million yearly the syrians responded by blockading the christian 
enclave 
if the trends of escalation and tension persist in lebanon 
they would lead to a renewed outbreak of war at a large scale the 
daily annahar quoted an unidentified us diplomatic source as 
saying 
syrian troops entered lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate one year after the countris civil war began 
they later sided with the moslems

assault rifles fetal tissue transplants and 
mandatory employee health insurance will be among the topics debated 
this week at the american medical associations annual policymaking 
convention 
other items on the agenda for the amas house of delegates 
meeting include whether life support should be withheld for 
vegetative patients required cholesterol and sodium content labels 
on food products random drug testing of athletes and numerous 
resolutions on how to battle aids 
the 433 delegates representing state medical associations 
physicians medical students and hospital medical staffs nationwide 
act as a legislature for the nearly 300000member association 
setting policy for the nations largest doctors group the fiveday 
meeting begins sunday 
delegates will receive nearly 300 reports and proposed 
resolutions on topics ranging from fraud in scientific research to 
the hazards of wearing portable radios 
the house of delegates will vote during the convention on whether 
to adopt the proposals as official ama policy 
the associations board of trustees its governing body is 
recommending that state medical associations lobby for increasing 
legal alternatives for medically incompetent patients on life 
support systems 
the trustees recommend encouraging legislatures in the 40 states 
without a durable power of attorney health care statute to enact 
the measure which allows people to authorize others to take legally 
binding action on their behalf including removing life support 
the trustees also recommend that physicians encourage their 
patients to document their wishes regarding the use of 
lifeprolonging medical treatments 
a joint report from the amas council on scientific affairs and 
council on ethical and judicial affairs encourages continued federal 
funding for fetal tissue transplants which they say have led to 
significant medical advances 
the councils address opposition from abortion opponents who fear 
the possibility that a womans decision to have an abortion will 
become coupled with a decision to donate fetal tissue 
safeguards to reduce any motivation reason or incentive by the 
woman to have an abortion can be developed they wrote 
delegates from michigan have proposed the ama seek legislation 
banning the sale or ownership of assault rifles 
a major purpose of assault rifles is to kill people their 
resolution says the medical profession has an obligation to 
promote programs and attitudes to safeguard the health and 
wellbeing of the community 
the trustees recommend that the ama endorse a plan that would 
require businesses to provide health insurance coverage for all 
employees 
the proposal would begin with larger employers and be phased in 
to include smaller ones it would also establish a program of 
diminishing tax credits or other incentives to avoid adverse 
effects on employers 
other recommendations include 
routine aids testing of newborns in areas where the disease is 
prevalent 
recording tobacco use on death certificates 
removing provisions in child abuse laws that allow parents to 
withhold proper medical attention from their children on religious 
grounds 
making possession of steroids for other than medical purposes a 
felony 
discouraging the use of infant walkers which critics link to 
thousands of injuries each year 
allowing physicians who treat the indigent to have income tax 
deductions

organizer and former smoke jumper les tschohl he estimated that 
1000 current and former smoke jumpers would attend the reunion 
which started friday 
there are only 400 active smoke jumpers in the nation tschohl

four weeks of training before they are used to fight forest fires 
once on the ground their main tool is a shovel a typical smoke 
jumpers fire is a single tree ablaze last year they stopped 
hundreds of lightning strikes from becoming infernos in the 
backcountry 
smoke jumpers are designed for rapid initial attack tschohl 
said 
earl cooley 77 who made the first jump into a forest fire on 
july 12 1940 the summer after the smoke jumping technique was 
developed said parachuting never scared him even so he said it 
just isnt natural to stick your head out the door and jump into 
open space 
mark klinger a current smoke jumped said advances in the 
quality of parachutes have made the job safer and easier 
tschohl said however that smoke jumpers are traditionbound 
and still sew their own jumping clothes and parachutes

the positive identification saturday of 
the body of a reputed new england mob boss has alerted federal 
authorities to the possibility of an underworld power struggle 
the death of william p grasso 62 was ruled a homicide after an 
autopsy showed that the new haven man died of a single gunshot wound 
to the neck authorities said 
two fishermen found grassos body friday in woods along the shore 
of the connecticut river in wethersfield just south of hartford 
the body was partly submerged 
it was unclear when the shooting occurred how long the body had 
been lying by the river or how it got there said sgt scott omara 
of the state police 
grasso was identified by the fbi last year as a topranking 
member of the patriarca crime family based in providence ri 
which is said to control illegal gambling loansharking and other 
rackets in hartford new haven boston providence worcester 
mass and many smaller cities and towns in an area stretching from 
connecticut to maine 
grasso was the single most influential organized crime figure 
in connecticut and one of the top two if not the top in new 
england said us attorney stanley a twardy 
its a very nasty business mr grasso allegedly was in 
usually we have to sit back and see what something like this shakes 
loose said assistant us attorney john durham who heads the 
organized crime strike force in connecticut 
twardy said the primary concern of federal agents is to determine 
what led to this murder and whether it was an internally 
sanctioned hit or an unsanctioned hit 
if this is an internally sanctioned hit involving the patriarca 
family then that would probably be the end of it twardy said 
but if it is an unsanctioned hit a feud between families there 
promise to be further hits down the road 
the us attorney said the fbi is investigating whether there is 
a connection between grassos death and the wounding friday outside 
boston of another reputed patriarca leader francis p salemme 56 
was the target of an attack by four men firing assault rifles 
authorities said 
according to published reports in boston and providence which 
quoted unidentified law officers salemme was an heirapparent in 
the patriarca family 
the boston globe on saturday quoted unnamed sources as saying 
grassos death could signal a war between the patriarca family and 
the new yorkbased genovese crime family the sources said grasso 
had been expected for some time to make a power grab in springfield 
mass territory now controlled by the genovese family 
known for keeping an extremely low profile grasso gained 
underworld prominence in 1984 upon the death of raymond l 
patriarca who had run his organization from a vending machine 
company office in providence for 25 years grasso assumed a 
highechelon position under ray patriarca jr providence police 
were quoted as saying at the time 
federal officials said that in recent years the younger patriarca 
has seemed more interested in developing land in northern rhode 
island than in the business of the crime family 
the providencejournal on saturday quoted an unidentified law 
enforcement source as saying the shootings may indicate that someone 
in new england is displeased with patriarcas lowkey leadership 
in the late 1970s grasso was the target of state and federal 
investigations including a grand jury probe of allegations he 
controlled illegal gambling in new haven the investigations never 
led to his arrest 
more recently investigators had focused on grasso because of the 
disappearance in march 1988 of an east hartford restaurateur who 
allegedly had run afoul of the new york mob and the slaying in 
december 1988 of eric miller a professional boxer from hartford 
according to published reports

saturday for her official birthday celebration 
the royal family was out in strength for the trooping the color 
ceremony the queen mother turned 63 on april 21 but the official 
celebration is set on a day in june because the weather is likely to 
be better 
spectators lined the way as horsedrawn carriages bearing the 
queen and family members made their way slowly down the broad mall 
that leads from buckingham palace toward the the graveled open space 
of the horse guards parade for the big event 
to the cadence of military bands rank after rank of footsoldiers 
marched along the avenue and hundreds of cavalrymen in plumed 
helmets and chromeplated breastplates rode by on gleaming horses 
spurs jangling and swords glinting in the sun

thousands of military observers would 
supervise a cambodian peace agreement under a un plan that parties 
to the 11yearold war are discussing according to a senior 
diplomat 
he said it would be one of the most expensive peacekeeping 
operations undertaken by the united nations 
vietnam has announced it will withdraw all of its 70000 
remaining troops from cambodia by sept 30 and the diplomat said 
friday the united nations is running short of time to formulate a 
peace plan 
there have been negotiations between the vietnameseinstalled 
government of premier hun sen and a fractious alliance of three 
opposition groups the radical khmer rouge noncommunist forces 
loyal to former premier son sann and supporters of exhead of state 
prince norodom sihanouk 
the opposition groups have been fighting a guerrilla war against 
the government since vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 
ousted the khmer rouge and set up another communist government 
the khmer rouge gained power in the spring of 1975 defeating the 
usbacked government more than a million people were killed in 
purges by the khmer rouge and its forced evacuation of the cities to 
abolish all western influence 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar in a speech last month 
to the asia society said un officials have prepared a provisional 
plan for ending the conflict and organizing a government of national 
reconciliation he said the plan has been circulated among the 
warring parties but he provided no details 
the senior diplomat who represents one of the nations involved 
in the cambodian entanglement said the un plan under 
consideration calls for at least 2000 un military observers plus 
election observers to oversee balloting for a coalition government 
the diplomat spoke with the condition he not be identified 
he emphasized the plan is in the preliminary stage and said an 
international conference to be held in paris in august will decide 
what nations would be acceptable as un peacekeepers 
negotiations are set for july 2425 in paris between hun sens 
government and the opposition alliance 
the diplomat said the cambodian groups have to determine the 
status of the armed resistance forces the khmer rouse is the 
strongest and best organized with an estimated 30000 combat 
veterans sihanounk son sann and hun sen have declared their 
opposition to participation by khmer rouge leaders responsible for 
the mass killings in the late 1970s 
vietnam has resisted un involvement because the world body 
still recognizes the regime ousted by the vietnamese as cambodias 
legitimate government 
vietnam and cambodia have expressed a preference for india 
poland and canada to supervise the vietnamese troop withdrawal 
but the senior diplomast said he believed the united nations 
would supervise the withdrawal and the establishment of some form of 
coalition government 
he said that of the five permanent members of the un security 
council the united states britain france and china oppose the 
vietnameseinstalled government and favor a strong un role 
the soviet union the fifth permanent member and vietnams main 
backer probably would accept a un peacekeeping operation and 
influence vietnam to cooperate the diplomat said

time inc is asking shareholders to reject an 
unwanted 107 billion takeover bid from paramount communications 
corp and approve its decision to make an offer for its wouldbe 
merger partner warner communications inc 
in a letter to shareholders released saturday time reiterated 
the stand it took friday the media giant announced then it had 
turned down the paramount bid and amended the terms of its earlier 
stockswap merger agreement with warner to include a 14 billion 
tender offer for warner at 70 a share 
time also said its shareholders meeting scheduled for friday at 
which stockholders were expected to vote on the original timewarner 
merger proposal would be adjourned until june 30 
at that time shareholders are expected to vote on the election 
of directors and other business but no matters related to the 
proposed merger with warner time said 
time told shareholders the early returns of proxies mailed in 
connection with the earlier merger agreement strongly supported the 
timewarner combination however many of these proxies likely were 
received before paramount announced its 175pershare cash bid on 
june 6 
time told shareholders paramounts offer was highly conditional 
and subject to many uncertainties including obtaining the necessary 
14 billion of financing and all required regulatory approvals 
time repeated its estimate that it would take as long as a year 
for paramount to win the approvals required from some 800 cable 
television systems for which time now holds franchises that would 
delay the completion of paramounts bid and consequently payments 
to time shareholders for their stock 
in the letter and an accompanying securities and exchange 
commission filing time also charged that terms of the financing for 
paramounts offer have not been determined or negotiated 
time officials made each of these points in statements and 
interviews friday after they announced their longawaited response 
to paramounts bid paramount said friday it expected the 
conditions will be satisfied with reasonable promptness and said 
it would continue to pursue time 
time outlined on friday a twostage offer under which it would 
pay 70 a share in cash for 100 million warner shares and then 
exchange 70 a share in cash and securities for the remaining 100 
million shares of warner stock 
a merger of time and warner would drive up the cost of acquiring 
the company the acquisition of warner also would increase times 
debt load and make it less attractive to wouldbe bidders 
under the agreement announced in march time stockholders would 
get a share in the new company timewarner inc for each time 
share while warner shareholders would get 0465 of a share of the 
new company for each of their warner shares 
time conceded in its letter that the original timewarner merger 
plan had accounting and financial advantages because it involved an 
exchange of stock 
but it said shareholders ultimately would benefit from the 
revised agreement because the price of their time stock would rise 
after the merger reflecting the assets and cash flow of the two 
companies combined 
time stock slumped 9 to 16250 a share in new york stock 
exchange consolidated trading friday while warner rose 362 to 
5925 a share and paramount fell 137 to 5812 
analysts said there was still speculation on wall street that the 
paramount bid might succeed and that prevented time stock from 
falling further

soviet activist andrei sakharov 
said saturday the kremlin could someday launch a chinesestyle 
crackdown on the soviet prodemocracy movement 
i fear that in the future something like it can happen in our 
country sakharov told reporters in this northern dutch city 
where he was awarded a honorary law degree on friday 
the political activity of the masses has increased to a very 
high degree in the soviet union and the political leadership is 
becoming scared the 68yearold human rights activist said 
sakharov received the silver medal of the dutch academy of 
sciences in amsterdam on saturday 
sakharov said there was an unprecedented loss of confidence in 
the political leaders in his country and he called on soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to speed the pace of democratic 
reforms 
that is the only way to avoid a disaster the country is on 
the brink of catastrophe 
nothing has been achieved during the 72 years of power monopoly 
by the communist party which cost tens of millions of lives he 
said there is no economic structure no opportunity for 
technological progress and no social justice 
sakharovs remarks in russian were translated into dutch by a 
groningen university interpreter 
the nuclear physicist who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 
1975 for his human rights efforts called on the soviet leadership 
to support the prodemocracy movement in china 
such support would reinforce the campaign for democratic change 
in the soviet union he said 
chinese troops crushed the movement in beijing on june 34 
estimates differ on how many died the chinese government variously 
says 200 to 300 people mostly soldiers were killed unofficial 
chinese and western intelligence reports say troops fired on unarmed 
crowds and killed up to 3000 
gorbachev in his most extensive comments since visiting china 
last month said this week that the soviet leadership regretted some 
aspects of the conflict in china and expressed concerns over the 
future of reforms there 
gorbachev allowed sakharov to return to moscow in december 1986 
after nearly seven years in exile in gorky sakharov supported 
gorbachev early on but has become increasingly critical saying that 
democratic reforms are being hampered by conservatives and that 
gorbachev himself has not gone far enough 
for instance sakharov was among those saying that gorbachevs 
election as president and communist party general secretary 
concentrated too much power in one mans hands nevertheless 
sakharov has returned to official good favor 
he was given his old job back at the academy of sciences where 
he works as a physicist has been quoted frequently in the official 
press spoken at officially sponsored news conferences and been 
allowed to travel to the west 
gorbachev has shown respect for sakharov but at the recent 
soviet congress meeting gorbachev criticized sakharov for saying 
the session was a failure 
sakharovs journey to the netherlands is his third trip abroad 
he is accompanied by his wife yelena bonner 
on friday he accepted an honorary law degree from the state 
university in groningen 120 miles northeast of amsterdam he was 
cited for his exceptional services to the cause of human 
rights 
on sunday sakharov and ms bonner are to fly to london to visit 
friends said rob rutgers dean of the universitys law faculty

the communist party hopes to recover a 
shred of dignity and solidarity another triumph in sundays runoff 
elections for parliamentary seats undecided in the first round of 
voting two weeks ago 
in the june 4 balloting solidaritybacked candidates won 252 of 
the 261 seats allotted to the opposition in the new national 
assembly 
there are contests sunday for only eight seats in the new 
100member senate where opposition candidates were allowed to run in 
all races and won 92 
in the sejm the existing parliament opposition candidates were 
allowed to run for 161 of the 460 seats and the 299 remaining seats 
were set aside for candidates of the communist party and its allies 
opposition candidates won 160 seats leaving only one open for 
the runoff but the communists and their allies won only five of the 
seats allotted to them and voters will decide on the 294 other seats 
in the runoff 
to win a seat under procedures agreed to in an april agreement by 
the communist government and solidarity a winner had to receive a 
majority of the vote the agreement providing for polands freest 
elections in more than four decades also legalized the solidarity 
union movement that had been suppressed under martial law in 1981 
and then outlawed 
solidarity has adopted a strategy of backing reform candidates in 
the runoff races involving the seats set aside for the communists 
we have learned the taste of victory solidarity leader lech 
walesa told the unions national executive commission at a meeting 
saturday in gdansk 
he said of the june 4 elections society gave us more than we 
wanted and now the main thing is to build the union 
although nearly all of sundays contests involve seats reserved 
for the communists and their allies solidarity has been campaigning 
for a strong voter turnout 
they will be our partners in the sejm solidarity spokesman 
janusz onyszkiewicz said friday of the communists one cannot be 
indifferent to what these partners will be like it could be 
worthwhile to support someone it could be worthwhile to cross 
someone out 
opposition publications have listed at least 59 communist or 
allied candidates considered sympathetic to solidarity 
those liberal candidates could combine with solidaritys elected 
deputies to create a powerful bloc in the sejm and work with the 
unions overwhelming senate majority 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski has been trying to put the 
pieces back together after the crushing defeats in the first round 
in a speech last week he called the june 4 results a onetime 
aberration attributable to communist party mistakes and poor 
economic conditions that he said made many poles pin exaggerated 
hopes on the opposition

charles haughey the great survivor of 
irish politics said saturday he intends to be prime minister again 
despite an embarrassing setback in national elections 
late returns from thursdays voting indicated that haugheys 
fianna fail party would return to the parliament known as the dail 
with fewer seats 
its quite clear that you cant impose stringent financial 
policies which are unpopular and expect the people to give you the 
sort of majority we were looking for haughey said 
haughey failed to win a majority in four previous elections 
although he twice was able to form governments with the support of 
other parties he served his first term as prime minister after 
assuming leadership of the party while it was already in power 
haughey said however he did not intend to resign as leader of 
the fianna fail party we will form a government he said 
with a halfdozen seats short of a majority haughey must find 
support among the opposition before june 26 when the dail 
reconvenes and the new prime minister will be chosen 
alan dukes conservative leader of secondplace fine gael said 
he could not predict what would happen 
wait and see dukes said saturday because the vision we 
have in the heat of the moment may not be the best in the long 
term 
the election returns showed a shift to the left labor and the 
workers party gained seats a social democrat won a seat and for 
the first time so did a member of the green party 
the results prompted talk of a historic realignment of irish 
politics 
we have never had an ideological base to irish politics 
before said labor leader dick spring this election has seen a 
further rightleft realignment and we are going to build on that 
with all seats decided fianna fail had won 77 a loss of 3 fine 
gael 55 a gain of 5 labor party 15 up 4 workers party 7 up 3 
progressive democrats 6 down 8 social democrats 1 green party 1 
independents and others 4 
fianna fail soldiers of destiny and fine gael family of the 
irish are both conservative economically but fine gael tends to be 
more liberal on social issues the progressive democrats are 
breakaways from fianna fail 
the returns indicated that fianna fail was hurt by public anger 
over cuts in health service over new fishing licenses in western 
ireland and perhaps by a campaign by army wives for better pay for 
soldiers 
in the past the 63yearold haughey thrived in adversity 
appointed to his first cabinet post in 1961 he was dropped from the 
government in 1970 after being charged with smuggling arms to the 
irish republican army in northern ireland 
acquitted in court haughey battled back to become minister of 
health and social welfare in 1977 and prime minister in 1979 he 
also was unscathed by a 1982 scandal in which his justice minister 
was accused of ordering wiretaps on members of the dail 
haughey had been running well in opinion polls with a peak of 54 
percent in february but fianna fail pulled 44 percent in the 
election slightly up from two years ago 
gerry osullivan of the labor party who finished first in 
northcentral cork said closings of 15 hospitals were a factor in 
his victory 
you cannot phase out billions and billions in debt in two 
years he said of haugheys budget cuts 
the fishing license issue cost fianna fail a seat in west galway 
said dick willis president of the munster trout angling council 
outraged anglers have refused to pay for the new licensing 
frank durcan an independent who opposed the licenses fell short 
in west mayo where fianna fail held its two seats 
none of three army wives who campaigned for higher pay for their 
husbands won a seat but they made a decent showing 
june kiernan polled 3207 first preference votes in longford 
westmeath where 8460 votes were required for election fianna 
fail lost one of its three seats in the district 
fianna fail claims the mantle of forces that originally opposed 
the partition of ireland in 1921 its nationalism has kept it in 
power for most of the republics 68year history

the soviet union upstaged its competitors at the 
paris air show with a selection of military and commercial aircraft 
and a marketing style that made it clear the new priority is to make 
sales not war 
soviet pilots flew flamboyant aerobatic routines in jet fighters 
never before seen in the west that wowed the crowds on the ground 
industry professionals were just as impressed with the soviets 
capitalist fervor 
this air show has made me aware that they intend to 
aggressively seek foreign currency through the sale of their 
aircraft to the west said james roberts deputy undersecretary of 
state for aviation in the us department of commerce 
i never before considered them a competitive threat now i 
do said roberts who attended the 10day show which closes sunday 
the soviets even managed to turn the crash of the mig29 on the 
shows opening day to their advantage the pilot anatoly kvochur 
became the hero of the day and the seat that allowed him to eject 
safely captured industry attention as the technology of the hour 
at the worlds greatest aviation showandsell the soviets 
impressed visitors with the range and sophistication of their 12 
aircraft on display including two new airliners the latest jet 
fighters and the massive an225 transport carrying the shuttle buran 
clearly the soviet aircraft industry has made enormous 
strides said ian woodward a spokesman for british aerospace 
commercial planes theyve been behind but theyre catching up 
fast 
a team of seven soviet salesmen employed by aviaexport the 
soviet marketing arm worked nonstop throughout the long hot 
afternoons 
moscows central institute of aviation motors offered air show 
participants its research services 
soviet aircraft components were on display in the ussr 
pavilion the soviet space agency glavkosmos peddled its launch 
services and design engineers for nearly every soviet plane 
displayed were on hand to answer questions 
anatoly bulanenko deputy chief designer for the antonov design 
bureau told reporters that permission had been granted for the 
an225 to be leased or chartered to foreign clients to carry 
commercial freight the plane which can haul up to 250 tons will 
carry space rockets for the european space agency next fall 
bulanenko acknowledged that political difficulties may arise in 
arranging deals but said business should come first 
many industry observers predicted the soviets will experience 
some turbulence in seeking to put their planes in western skies 
they will need to convince customers that the airplanes are 
reliable have good aftersale support and low maintenance 
costs said john hayhurst a marketing executive for boeing co 
the largest us civil aircraft maker 
boeings 747 would be the chief competitor for the new soviet 
jetliner tupelov 204 now being tested other soviet planes 
including the new ilyushin96300 would face established 
competition from mcdonnell douglas of st louis mo and airbus 
industrie the european consortium 
edward sluchevsky head of aviaexport transport sales said his 
team of lateblooming capitalists are not beginners we have 
traditions we have a reputation in the limited market we have 
served 
furthermore we are ready to include in our contracts the same 
product support the same guarantees of reliability as our western 
competitors he said in an interview at the soviet chalet where a 
constant stream of curious pilots engineers and others came to call 
for customers the biggest question may be the quality of soviet 
engines reputedly inefficient and requiring frequent maintenance 
the soviets say they can resolve the problems and even have offered 
to install westernmade engines in their planes 
in the military market the soviets will be vying for a piece of 
a shrinking pie cuts in defense spending have put the crunch on 
even wellestablished arms makers 
soviet officials said they hope to increase total export sales 
from the 227 billion projected for 1989 to about 3 billion by 
1995 
us aerospace exports projected for 1989 are 278 billion

astronaut s david griggs who flew on the 
space shuttle in 1985 and was training to pilot a mission in 
november died saturday when the stunt plane he was flying slammed 
into a field authorities said 
lamar coleman a dispatcher for the crittenden county sheriffs 
department said the crash happened just after 9 am south of 
earle which is about 20 miles west of memphis tenn 
i was told he was out here practicing this morning and was 
going to go to an air show at clarksville ark said peter 
kerwin an investigator for the federal aviation administration who 
was on the scene 
the show was saturday afternoon and griggs was flying because he 
was a friend of greg mcneely to whom the wrecked aircraft was 
registered kerwin said 
an astronaut since august 1979 griggs 49 had been undergoing 
training as pilot for shuttle flight number 33 aboard the discovery 
scheduled for november nasa said 
based on what we do know in our experience with shuttle crew 
training we dont see anything that would signal that we could not 
continue to move toward that november launch date said nasa 
spokesman jeff carr in houston 
carr said a replacement for griggs would have to be named within 
the next week or so adding that it should not be a problem to draw 
from the pool of available astronauts 
were five months out from flight carr said training 
doesnt really begin until about this time three other flights 
in july september and october are scheduled before the november 
launch 
griggs was flying for mcneely charter service a private air 
service based in earle according to a woman who answered the 
companys phone the woman who declined to give her name referred 
questions to nasa 
griggs was piloting a world war ii vintage t6 a twoseater 
singleengine propeller aircraft used for training said civil air 
patrol lt jeff crum it crashed in a wheat field about 150 yards 
away from hangars operated by charter company which owned the 
plane crum said the plane had been modified for air shows 
witnesses have told us the plane was doing some sort of 
aerobatic maneuver said cpl rick dickinson a spokesman for the 
arkansas state police the pilot was killed on impact 
william h wooden said he was working in his yard near the air 
field and heard the steady drone of the planes engine stop which 
caught his attention he looked up in time to see the small craft 
hurtling toward the ground 
he was cutting up flying upside down and all kinds of ways 
every kind of way ive ever seen them fly those things wooden 
said 
hoover williams who lives near the crash site said the plane 
had been executing rolls 
then he attempted to turn back over and he did turn over but 
then he lost control started wobbling and his right wing hit the 
ground and thats what headed him out across that wheat field 
williams said 
joan gillum who also lives nearby said i thought he had come 
too close over my house and i was frightened he was going to fall in 
our house then i saw him when he circled around and he just went 
down 
he was doing a lot of turns and a lot of slips and i was just 
scared something like this was going to happen and it did ms 
gillum said 
asked whether nasa placed any restrictions on what astronauts 
could do in their own time including risky activities carr replied 
you cant lock these guys in their houses these guys have 
thousands of hours of flying experience they take a greater risk 
driving down the gulf freeway in houston than by flying there are 
no restrictions on piloting 
griggs flew as a mission specialist on a shuttle mission in april 
1985 
he was appointed chief of the shuttle training aircraft 
operations office in january 1976 his responsibility included 
operational use of the shuttle trainer 
griggs was a native of portland ore he graduated from the 
united states naval academy in 1962 and received a masters in 
administration from george washington university in 1970 
he served in the navy including two combat tours in southeast 
asia and a stint as a navy test pilot 
a biography issued by nasa listed flying as one his hobbies

federal security department was indicted for murder saturday in the 
slaying of an investigative journalist five years ago 
prosecutor rafael avanti contends zorrilla 47 was the 
mastermind of the killing of newspaper columnist manuel buendia in 
may 30 1984 
avanti said that during the indictment proceedings in the 34th 
penal court judge roberto hernandez martinez ordered zorrilla held 
for trial 
in presenting the case the prosecution said buendia was slain 
because zorrilla feared the journalist would expose links to some of 
mexicos major drug traffickers 
at the time of the slaying zorrilla was the chief of the federal 
security department the equivalent of the fbi in the united states 
the department was dismantled in 1985 because of alleged corruption

arraignment i did not kill my friend and there is no evidence 
that implicates me he did not enter a plea at the indictment

years in prison 
authorities have said zorrilla was one of the first law 
enforcement officers at the scene of the shooting of buendia they 
also said they have in custody the gunman who shot the journalist 
but they have not identified him or given other details

united mine workers president richard 
trumka renewed his call saturday for the pittston co to help end a 
coal strike that has expanded into wildcat walkouts by more than 
20000 miners in six states 
coal fields in the region were mostly quiet saturday a day when 
production slacks off at most mines before they close down for 
sunday no new walkouts were reported 
in southern west virginia a labor group affiliated with the 
aflcio put together a truck caravan saturday to take food to 
striking miners 
in a letter to pittston co chairman paul douglas trumka 
rejected pittstons assertion that contract talks are at an impasse 
impasse can only be reached after the parties have engaged in 
full good faith negotiations that leave each side with no more 
flexibility on the issues at stake that is not the case here 
trumka wrote 
first pittston has not engaged in good faith negotiations 
secondly the union continues to remain flexible on working out the 
differences between us 
pittston last week declared negotiations at an impasse which 
allowed it to implement its latest contract offer federal labor law 
requires umw leaders to present that offer to their membership 
pittston also restored benefit payments to about 1500 retirees 
widows and disabled miners the company had cut off those benefits 
when its contract expired in february 1988 
trumka told douglas the gesture was appreciated but said it was 
not enough pittstons actions are too little too late he 
wrote 
douglas said he had not received the letter and nothing 
trumka now says can change that situation 
about 1600 umw members went on strike against the pittston coal 
group inc a subsidiary of the pittston co in west virginia and 
virginia on april 5 other miners began unauthorized walkouts monday 
in southern west virginia in sympathy with the pittston strikers 
by saturday the wildcat walkouts had idled about twothirds of 
west virginias 24000 miners and miners in pennsylvania indiana 
virginia kentucky and tennessee

several truckloads of food from charleston to strikers in logan and 
beckley the 50 committee members in the caravan also planned to 
join picket lines after delivering the food said spokeswoman elaine 
harris

the striking miners tractortrailer trucks bearing food from union

two us immigration and naturalization service 
officials offered last week to donate blood for former philippine 
president ferdinand marcos who has been hospitalized since january 
a newspaper reported saturday 
roy hendricks the newly appointed acting district director and 
ins agent ben alexander made the offer friday while visiting marcos 
wife imelda to serve her with notice that she is banned from 
traveling the honolulu starbulletin reported 
their offer made me cry mrs marcos said imagine 
offering their blood to someone who is not even an american 
they are real human beings these two men mrs marcos said 
they put humanity before business these little people these 
errand boys showed me what america is really like 
i dont remember saying that hendricks said im not 
saying i did say it and im not saying i didnt say it i just dont 
remember 
i have no comment on it alexander said if that was said 
it was meant as a private not public offering 
the newspaper said one of its reporters who also was at the 
house heard the remarks 
marcos 71 underwent surgery saturday to stop a bleeding gastric 
ulcer he has been hospitalized since january and has remained on 
life support equipment since suffering cardiac lung and kidney 
failure last month 
both marcoses are under us indictment for allegedly stealing 
more than 100 million from the philippine treasury and stashing it 
in the united states mrs marcos is free on 5 million bail 
during the 45minute meeting with mrs marcos which was 
videotaped by a marcos family aide hendricks advised her to be 
strong take care of yourself cling to your religious 
beliefs and have confidence in the us legal system because 
it works it really works the newspaper said 
the travel ban requires mrs marcos to notify the ins in writing 
48 hours before she travels and is similar to travel restrictions 
imposed on marcos 18 months ago 
hendricks said he does not know what prompted the order against 
mrs marcos but the travel ban document says immigration officials 
have reason to believe that you intend to depart from the united 
states in a manner which would be prejudicial to the interests of 
the united states 
hendricks was named monday to succeed william craig who retired 
earlier this month 
craig said his retirement was planned before the disclosure last 
month that he had arranged a controversial party last august at the 
marcos estate here for ins western regional commissioner harold 
ezell and other ins officials 
ezell later admitted that it was an error to attend the party at 
which he and his wife were videotaped as they danced with the 
marcoses and he led a prayer asking for the marcos safe return to 
the philippines

when jack kemp accepted president bushs offer 
to become secretary of housing and urban development it looked like 
a welcome chance to stay in the spotlight after the failure of his 
republican presidential campaign 
now that he is on the job kemp faces the task of cleaning up and 
airing out what may be the worst financial abuses lingering from the 
reagan administration 
the department that was regarded as a governmental backwater 
during eight years under secretary samuel r pierce jr has been 
shaken by a series of scandals stemming from that period 
kemp appearing saturday on cable news networks evans and 
novak program said abuses in hud were not unique to the reagan 
administration and that political influence in the department 
existed a lot longer than eight years 
kemp said bush should get credit for any reforms at hud adding 
there was a poison in the system and we have moved quickly to 
take the poison out 
so far investigators report finding what appears to be 
multimilliondollar fraud the steering of millions in public funds 
to politically connected developers and consultants and 
mismanagement on a staggering scale 
the scandal at hud is one of the most complex national scandals 
that we have seen in decades said rep tom lantos dcalif 
chairman of a house subcommittee investigating the department 
there is a degree of mismanagement fraud abuse waste 
influencepeddling that we have just barely begun to touch he 
said 
following charges on capitol hill that the justice department was 
showing little interest in some of the scandal attorney general 
dick thornburgh on thursday ordered federal prosecutors to 
investigate all hud offices for fraud and embezzlement 
the revelations have come so fast that investigators are 
hardpressed to keep up together they suggest that hud had become a 
financial honey pot for developers contractors wellconnected 
republicans and others all in an era when the department was 
subjected to largescale cutbacks in social spending 
pierce was one of the leastvisible of reagans cabinet 
secretaries and the only one to serve throughout reagans eight 
years as president while his lowkey role earned him the nickname 
silent sam in office he has become the political focus of 
congressional outrage 
like picking up a large stone only to discover that bugs and 
slime have grown in the darkness this investigation has exposed the 
corruption which flourished unchecked under secretary pierces 
hud said rep charles schumer dny a subcommittee member 
secretary sam pierce ran the most sloppy incompetent agency in 
government that we have seen in perhaps a generation said lantos 
pierce did not return phone calls to his new york law firm 
appearing before lantoss committee last month he said he delegated 
decisions about awarding hud grants to aides including his 
executive assistant deborah gore dean 
dean refused to testify citing her fifth amendment rights 
against selfincrimination she has been quoted by the wall street 
journal as saying of the renovation program we ran it in a 
political manner 
kemp has ordered investigations and has been praised by lantos 
and others in congress for dealing with the problems the first of 
the scandals was revealed when kemp released internal reports by 
paul adams the departments inspector general 
they said millions of dollars in hud subsidies for renovation of 
lowincome housing was distributed without regard to need or 
fairness and that much of it was steered to private developers who 
formerly had been hud officials or had ties to prominent republicans 
adams found that developers who won subsidies paid millions of 
dollars in consulting fees to former hud officials and prominent 
republicans among them was former interior secretary james watt 
who was paid some 400000 others include paul manafort a 
republican businessman who was a partner with republican national 
chairman lee atwater before atwater became bushs 1988 campaign 
manager and the late attorney general john mitchell who was a 
close family friend of dean 
few of the consultants had housing experience there has been 
little evidence they did much work for their money beyond making 
phone calls and holding meetings with pierce or other hud officials 
to secure the subsidy contracts for their projects 
the inspector general concluded there was a high cost to 
taxpayers in the programs mismanagement he reported hud could pay 
413 million in excess rental assistance over the 15year subsidy 
agreements because of the contracts 
the justice department has been reviewing huds internal audit of 
the program but spokesman joseph krovisky said its preliminary 
review didnt show any criminal violations 
perhaps even more startling than the revelations about 
wellconnected consultants is evidence of embezzlement by real 
estate agents under contract to represent hud in the sale of 
property hud owned because of foreclosures 
these agents were retained to close the sales and send the 
proceeds to hud it is a task that the reagan administration took 
away from hud employees and contracted out as part of the 
privatization of government 
a maryland woman marilyn loise harrell has told investigators 
she used her contract with hud to improperly take as much as 55 
million 
her scheme was hardly complicated she told investigators that at 
first she began banking the money for a time and collecting interest 
for herself soon she said she started keeping all the money due 
hud 
no one noticed when the proceeds were not remitted she said 
in a sworn statement 
she contends she used the money for charitable causes 
investigators though skeptical nicknamed her robin hud 
similarly a grand jury in fort worth texas indicted reba 
louise lovell on charges of stealing 25 million from the sale of 
55 homes around dallas in washington dc investigators are 
looking for a lawyer who disappeared over a year ago after serving 
as huds agent and officials have said more than 3 million may be 
missing 
auditors and prosecutors are looking at all hud property sale 
arrangements and hud officials expect the reports of embezzlement 
to grow 
investigators say they do not suspect a conspiracy among the 
agents to defraud the government but believe each independently 
discovered the same thing no one at hud was paying attention 
still another scandal swirls around new yorks republican 
senator alfonse m damato a report in the new york times based 
in part on a 5yearold hud audit said officials in the village of 
island park on long island rigged the distribution of federally 
subsidized houses in the early 1980s selecting politically 
connected recipients and keeping out blacks 
among those allowed to purchase subsidized inexpensive homes was 
a cousin of damato and the son of geraldine mcgann a highranking 
hud administrator who also sat on the village board some of the 
subsidized houses were later resold at substantial profits 
kemp has ordered a new audit and placed mcgann on leave 
damato has denied wrongdoing but thanks to his lobbying the 
village last year received 1 million in hud money for construction 
of a swimming pool 
damato also has figured in allegations about the renovation 
subsidy program a former hud official told the wall street journal 
that damato pushed for approval of subsidy funds for projects in 
puerto rico and apparently with some success since 7 percent of 
the programs funds went to that small island territory damato 
denied helping developers in puerto rico 
in addition kemp aide mary brunette said hud has asked the us 
attorney in denver to investigate allegations that an accountant in 
the agencys regional office manipulated an automated billpaying 
system to siphon off 1 million

the nations mayors after eight years of 
complaining that they were ignored by the white house searched for 
signs the bush administration will be more responsive as they 
gathered for their annual meeting saturday 
we feel the needs of the people of our major cities have not 
been given the priority that they should have been over the past 
decade said mayor kathy whitmire of houston 
president bush declined an invitation to attend the annual 
meeting of the us conference of mayors a convention of more than 
200 elected urban leaders that runs through wednesday 
two of his cabinet secretaries and other administration officials 
planned to address the mayors who have asked the administration to 
outline how it intends to establish its national urban policy 
we spent a good deal of our time under the reagan 
administration trying to save our programs said j thomas 
cochran executive director of the conference now were in a 
situation where mr bush has been elected and were trying to see 
what a kinder and gentler administration will mean 
dealing with drugs aids and homelessness are among the top 
concerns on the mayors agendas cochran said many mayors believe 
their cities are the front lines in those battles and that they were 
not given enough voice in the previous administrations handling of 
them 
those are three very lonely issues cochran said in an 
interview we believe weve been setting national policy it is 
only fair that if congress is going to come forth on housing or 
drugs that we be involved wed like to be back at the table 
republican mayor bob isaac of colorado springs colo said at an 
opening news conference that the absence of bush and vice president 
dan quayle should not be read as a lack of administration interest 
in urban problems 
some democratic mayors were inclined to agree but suggested 
they expected better in the future 
in fairness the president was abroad most recently and hes 
got to weigh his schedule said mayor joseph riley of the host 
city a former president of the group and leading urban advocate 
i wouldnt let the fact that the first year they didnt come 
make a statement he said hopefully theyll make it next year 
but if not then there might be reason to be concerned 
whitmire a democrat who is in line to become president of the 
group this week said mayors are certainly optimistic and have 
found the doors to be open so far in the new administration 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemp whose 
department has been rocked by charges of multimilliondollar fraud 
and influence peddling during the reagan adminisration is scheduled 
to address the mayors monday transportation secretary samuel 
skinner and environmental protection agency administrator william k 
reilly are to speak tuesday 
bushs new proposals to cut acid rain and curb urban smog are 
among the issues on the mayors agenda others include crime day 
care housing mass transit regulation of cable television and 
maintaining congressional support for the remaining federal urban 
aid programs 
the mayors will vote on dozens of resolutions including one 
proposal that calls for increased federal aid and cuts in defense 
spending as a way to provide more aid for urban programs 
the troubles at hud may be aired at a workshop the mayors plan 
although mayors avoided any criticism of huds previous management 
at an opening news conference 
the hud scandals are a blow to cities however because the 
department is the agency that handles much of the federal aid 
flowing to urban america and is the principal advocate within the 
government for many of those programs 
a frequent lament from mayors has been the reagan 
administrations fiscal assault on federal housing programs in 
which cuts in huds budget authority amounted to 80 percent when 
adjusted for inflation

locks and the demonstrators were removed and booked on charges of 
trespassing and resisting without violence police said 
the protesters were met at the clinic by about 20 
counterdemonstrators 
this issue is not only about abortion but a womans right to 
health care said linda osten president of the upper pinellas

us citizens need visas to enter 
nicaragua beginning july 1 and president daniel ortega said 
saturday the measure is necessary to prevent washington from 
meddling in his countrys affairs 
panamas de facto leader gen manuel antonio noriega on 
saturday urged nicaragua not to hold elections as scheduled next 
february because of what he described as us interference 
us embassy spokesman lou falino declined comment on the visa 
requirement and officials with the foreign ministry which 
announced the measure late friday were not available 
the leftist government has expressed suspicion that the united 
states may attempt to affect the outcome of the february elections 
the opposition newspaper la prensa said in its saturday editions 
that the visa requirement is a legal formula to prevent an 
avalanche of us journalists and political observers from coming to 
analyze and observe what occurs in our elections 
ortega speaking in a managua suburb said his government will 
require visiting americans to visas because the employees of the 
yanqui government continue to abuse the hospitality of nicaragua 
he said washington continues to conspire against the people of 
nicaragua 
noriega head of panamas defense forces said the united states 
participated in irregularities during panamas may 7 elections 
which international observers say the opposition won but the 
government nullified 
nicaragua keep your eyes open dont be fools dont hold 
elections because they will repeat the same medicine of panama 
noriega told parlimentarians from 10 latin american countries 
meeting in david 250 miles west of panama city 
barricada the official newspaper of the ruling sandinista party 
and el nuevo diario a progovernment dailyand el nuevo diario have 
published stories in the past few days about a secret plan to 
funnel 3 million to nicaraguas opposition parties 
the sandinista government has said several times that the 
february elections will be a political confrontation with the 
united states which supports the nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
earlier this month the foreign ministry said us diplomats will 
not be allowed to act as election observers to invite them would 
be the equivalent of asking the fox to guard the henhouse it said 
it also said the american diplomats could not attend opposition 
party meetings or rallies 
nicaragua has twice expelled us diplomats over the past year 
accusing them of interfering in its internal affairs 
in may it expelled kathleen williamson barnon a labor attache 
and economic attache joel franklin cassman saying they tried to 
manipulate teachers into a nationwide strike 
the us responded six days later by expelling two nicaraguan 
diplomats wiliam vigil and roberto vargas 
in july last year a large opposition rally brought about another 
series of expulsions nicaragua ordered us ambassador richard 
melton and seven other diplomats to leave and washington retaliated 
by expelling the nicaraguan ambassador

the new york board of regents on friday 
banned a commercialladen news program from the states high 
schools becoming the second state in the nation to frown on the 
project 
the regents rejected whittle communications channel one 
program saying they were worried the active commercialization 
of the programs would send the wrong message to high school students 
the 12minute news program contains two minutes of commercials 
for candy jeans acne cream and other products aimed at teenagers 
in return for an agreement to show the daily programs whittle wired 
high schools with complete closed circuit television systems 
including satellite dishes televisions and videocassette recorders 
its a very tempting package that has a flaw state education 
commissioner thomas sobol 
the decision is a blow to the tennesseebased whittle which has 
said it needs to sign up 40 percent of the nations high schools if 
channel one was to be successful earlier this month california 
officials threatened their schools with a loss of funding if they 
signed contracts with whittle 
some regents also expressed anger with whittles aggressive 
lobbying in support of channel one edward meyer of westchester 
county charged that some members of the education board told him 
whittle had offered them jobs or consulting contracts if they 
supported the project 
meyer declined to name the regents involved and several other 
regents interviewed denied any knowledge of such offers laura 
eshbaugh executive vice president for whittle communications said 
she knew nothing about any offers 
eshbaugh said she was disappointed with the decision by the new 
york board but said channel one would be able to survive the 
rejection 
whittle had increased its offer to the regents and taken its case 
to the public in the days leading to friday mornings board meeting 
the company ran two fullpage advertisements in the new york times 
and meyer said some regents were bombarded by junk fax messages 
in support of whittle 
whittle offered to donate 1000 hours of satellite time so other 
educational programming could be shown in schools education 
department officials said the company also said it would pay 
500000 to new yorks public broadcasting system 
but whittle wouldnt take out the commercials 
several regents said they worried the commercials would cause 
poor students who couldnt afford items advertised to feel 
inadequate they also said the program seems geared to suburban 
students instead of the more troubled city schools that need the 
technology whittle could provide 
but eshbaugh said schools contain many forms of advertising such 
as wall posters yearbook advertisements and brand names emblazoned 
on the clothing students wear 
commercialization is there she said however any of us 
might not like it there its there to stay

the first stadium show in toronto said publicist sean mahoney 
its something well be proud to talk about for decades to 
come said david covey station manager of wwscfm the no 1 
thing on everybodys mind is how can i get tickets 
original members pete townshend roger daltrey and john entwistle 
are reuniting to mark the whos 25th anniversary theyre planning 
threehour shows at stadiums across the country plus full 
performances of the rock opera tommy in new york as a benefit 
and in los angeles 
but first theyll have to make it in glens falls 
its going to be a shot in the arm for us said glens falls 
mayor frank okeefe theyve rented the civic center for an 
extended period of time theyre going to bring a lot of activity to 
the city and were glad to have them 
i never heard of who but my two teenagers told me about 
them okeefe said the younger society not that im old are 
getting awfully excited about it 
for glens falls its a payoff for the civic centers growing 
reputation as a place where many big names of the entertainment 
industry go to rehearse if not necessarily to perform 
with its outoftheway location and one of the countrys most 
popular outdoor entertainment venues just a half hour south in 
saratoga springs the glens falls civic center is empty for much of 
the summer 
to make ends meet arena management began asking entertainers 
five or six years ago if they wanted to rent out the place to 
rehearse artists such as billy joel def leppard and judas priest 
have said yes 
when he heard the who were reforming several months ago civic 
center manager jack kelley said he began making overtures to the 
band and kept his fingers crossed 
this is a very funny business and people do change their minds 
very quickly said kelley a former general manager of the 
hartford whalers hockey team 
most of the time bands that rent out the civic center look to 
lower their costs by agreeing to a public peformance there he said 
thats what happened with the who 
despite security guards ringing the civic center during the whos 
rehearsal time most of what goes on inside isnt particularly 
exciting stage managers and roadies spend a lot of time putting the 
stage sound equipment and lights together and make sure they can be 
disassembled quickly 
townshend daltrey and crew will actually be on stage only 
briefly in the empty arena to practice songs such as my 
generation and baba oriley kelley said 
on the tour itinerary the glens falls date is pointedly listed 
as a warmup show the who may need the extra time to get used 
to all its new personnel drummer simon phillips has replaced kenney 
jones for this tour john bundrick will play keyboards and steve 
bolton will play guitar 
townshend who reportedly has severe ear problems brought on by 
years of power chords on his electric guitar will stick to an 
acoustic guitar for the shows 
the band will also cart around a horn section a percussion 
section and three backup singers 
although the who doesnt have a new album and has no plans for 
one the band is expected to play cuts from townshends solo album 
the iron man due out at the end of this month 
the huge stage built for outdoor shows dwarfs glens falls tiny 
arena to fit all of the equipment the civic center will only be 
able to use roughly 5000 of its 8000 seats 
even before tickets went on sale kelley said he was already sick 
of all the tickets pleas he has received from friends and 
acquaintances 
for this city of 20000 people its easily the entertainment 
event of its life

despite detonating two bursts of stock trading on 
wall street the triple witching hour didnt produce damaging 
fallout 
uneasiness about what might happen during the quarterly 
occurrence had scared many individual investors away from the market 
for days they decided theyd be safer to wait until the dust 
settled friday before transacting their stock business 
the simultaneous expiration of stockindex futures index options 
and stock options can cause volatile swings in stock prices as 
investors holding those contracts try to balance their books by 
buying or selling the underlying stocks 
as predicted the stock market opened with a bang on friday 
within the first half hour of trading on the big board more than 
107 million shares changed hands and most of them moved in the first 
15 minutes by contrast nyse volume at 10 am edt the previous day 
totaled a more normal 2631 million shares 
the market handled the heavy volume at the opening quite 
well said newton d zinder analyst at shearson lehman hutton 
inc all the large blocks of stock were absorbed 
share prices didnt suffer a big jolt indicating how well the 
market coped with the crush of trading orders the dow jones 
industrial average of 30 bluechip stocks managed to eke out a small 
gain in the early going while measures of activity in the broader 
market posted only minor losses 
stock exchange procedures aimed at relieving market volatility 
apparently did the trick the procedures are used on the third 
friday of the last month in each quarter of the calendar year when 
the futures and options expire 
zinder said most of the orders were sales and by posting or 
advertising those blocks they were able to attract some buyers 
mitigating any weakness that might have occurred 
basically each quarter the nyse requires prior notification of 
orders related to complicated trading strategies used by 
professional investors designed to profit from price discrepancies 
between stocks and various stocklinked futures and options 
on friday orders due to take place at the opening had to be 
received by 9 am edt while orders to be executed at the close had 
to be in by 3 pm edt moved up from 330 pm on past expiration 
fridays in an effort to ease pressure at the end of the session 
speculation swirled around the market all week that an unusually 
large level of open interest in the futures market meaning 
more contracts than normal hadnt been closed before expiration 
could cause severe price gyrations in the stock market on friday 
no wild swings transpired and share price barometers registered 
temperate readings throughout the day before closing with modest 
gains 
trading exploded again near the close contributing to the 
heaviest singleday volume on the big board in about five months 
volume came to 24451 million shares making for the busiest session 
since jan 27 when 25487 million shares were traded 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 
248638 down 2704 from a week earlier it brought the loss over 
the past two weeks to 3145 points 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 278 to 17959 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market declined 
644 to 44721 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was off 433 at 36183 
volume on the big board averaged 18217 million shares a day 
down slightly from 18237 million the week before

ivan boesky may still be scraping plates in a 
prison canteen but the speculators legacy is writing more chapters 
in the wall street securities fraud opus the indictment of a former 
stocktrading pal who plotted to kill him and the founding of a new 
firm by americas junkbond pioneer 
boeskys status as chief government informant got another big 
boost this past week when a manhattan federal grand jury charged his 
onetime friend and fellow speculator john mulheren in a 42count 
indictment alleging securities fraud mail fraud conspiracy and 
phony recordkeeping 
the indictment represented another notch on the gun for the 
manhattan us attorneys office which has used boeskys 
confessions as the basis for what has become the biggest fraud 
scandal in wall street history 
for mulheren the indictment capped months of speculation that he 
had been implicated in serious wrongdoing by boesky who has been 
serving a threeyear term at a minimumsecurity federal prison in 
california since march 1988 
before boesky was incarcerated police had arrested mulheren for 
threatening to kill boesky with an assault rifle associates of 
mulheren said at the time he was depressed and angered that his 
onetime colleague in the stock speculation business was squealing 
in exchange for lenient treatment 
a day after the mulheren indictment another victim of boeskys 
took a dramatically different approach to the future michael 
milken drexel burnham lambert incs pioneering purveyor of 
highyield lowgrade securities known as junk bonds quit the firm 
and formed his own 
that move finally severed one of the bestknown financial 
relationships of the decade milken one of the worlds wealthiest 
financiers is considered responsible for drexels enormous success 
in junk bonds 
the milkendrexel marriage first began to deteriorate late last 
year when drexel chose to settle federal securities fraud charges 
spawned by boeskys confessions while milken vowed to fight them 
many drexel employees and clients thought the firm had turned its 
back on milken though he remained diplomatically silent on the 
subject 
when a federal grand jury indicted milken in march on 98 counts 
of securities fraud tax fraud and racketeering he took a leave of 
absence from drexel and speculation intensified he would quit 
what remains unclear now is whether his new company 
international capital access group will draw clients and talent 
away from his exemployer milken said the company will offer 
consulting to businesses that want to raise money equally unclear 
is whether milkens company will survive he faces 185 billion in 
forfeitures of alleged illegal profits and a lengthy prison term if 
convicted in what is the largest federal securities crime 
prosecution to date 
in other business and economic news this past week 
a dazzling threeway takeover brawl unfolded between time inc 
paramount communications inc and warner communications inc time 
launched a tender offer for warner that values the company at 124 
billion after a stockswap deal between them collapsed paramount

the dollar took a wild ride hitting the highest level in more 
than three years against some currencies before tumbling in a 
panicky selloff that reflected investor worries and profittaking

in recent weeks might have evaporated 
government economic figures presented an inconclusive picture 
the trade deficit shrank in april while business inventories rose 
only slightly suggesting economic strength but industrial 
production remained largely unchanged in may and retail sales barely 
rose suggesting weakness

if there is a single theme that dominates talk 
about the us economy so far in 1989 it is embodied in the catch 
phrase soft landing 
for months now investors and business planners have been 
debating whether the federal reserve can pull the trick off 
bringing the highflying economy down to earth without a hard impact 
that inflicts a lot of pain 
some skeptics dismiss the whole idea as a dangerous fantasy the 
kind of delusion that prompts companies to build new factories just 
before orders suddenly dry up or speculators to buy stocks at a 
market top 
the business cycle hasnt been abolished these observers say 
and sooner or later there will have to be a recession to wring out 
the excesses of a long period of expansion 
the doubters say they speak from long experience but maury 
harris economist at the investment firm of painewebber inc says 
they are overlooking two emphatic soft landing precedents in 
very recent economic history 
this current soft landing is a replay of the experiences in 
198486 and 196667 he contends 
following a tighter federal reserve system monetary policy 
growth slowed and because the economy was not at full employment 
inflation slowed enough to allow a drop in interest rates sufficient 
to sustain growth 
one problem some people have in buying the idea of a soft 
landing harris says is that the term has never been clearly 
defined 
there is a formal description of recession as monitored by the 
national bureau of economic research two consecutive quarters of 
declines in the nations gross national product after adjustment 
for inflation 
a soft landing by contrast has no such specific 
characteristics it might be called a nonrecession rather than a 
tangible event 
also harris says many analysts assume that the economy has 
reached full employment a point where inflation cant be tamed 
without stern measures that must almost certainly hurt business 
activity 
our view for some time has been that the economy is not at 
full employment harris says if we were at full employment 
wages would be rising a lot faster than the modest 38 percent rise 
over the past year 
stan shipley and robert barbera economists at shearson lehman 
hutton inc say confusion is natural in a period when a soft 
landing occurs 
as the economy downshifts from rapid growth to more moderate 
growth economic statistics can be mixed they observe 
often within one month a conflicting picture of the economy 
emerges with evidence of strength contrasted by evidence of 
weakness 
a case in point is the index of leading economic indicators the 
governments statistical means of trying to gauge future trends the 
index was down in february and march but rebounded strongly in 
april with a 08 percent rise 
when the may figure is reported later this month it is expected 
to show another drop 
over the last year however the index has edged up 21 percent 
that points say shipley and barbera to a soft landing not a 
recession 
harris for his part acknowledges that there is an 
understandable tendency to deny that the fed can fine tune the 
economy 
however he maintains if were not at full employment and 
quite positive real interest rates allow the potential for sharp 
rate declines if necessary theres lots of room for reversible and 
nonfatal errors in fed policies before theres too much inflation 
followed by a recession

the land that spawned the detachable collar and 
the nations steel industry is losing a leading drug research firm 
the same way it lost bustling mills and textile plants 
sterling drug inc is pulling 1200 jobs out of its operation in 
east greenbush crimping rensselaer countys plans to make the area 
once called little pittsburgh into little silicon valley 
troy was more than little pittsburgh said timothy hulburt 
president of the rensselaer county chamber of commerce it was the 
first pittsburgh pittsburgh was the second troy 
in the 1800s the trio of cities at the hudson and mohawk rivers 
troy watervliet and cohoes was ideally situated to become a 
major industrial center in mid19th century america troy mills 
pioneered the bessemer process of converting iron to steel a method 
quickly adopted nationwide 
troy ironmaster henry burden built the worlds biggest hydropower 
waterwheel and his mills churned out a horseshoe every second 
shodding almost all the horses used by the north in the civil war 
in 1826 troy housewife hannah montague tired of washing her 
husbands shirts when only the collars were dirty invented the 
detachable collar that sparked a new industry and earned troy the 
nickname collar city 
about 50 years ago the mills and textile plants began a slow 
fade to the south by the mid1970s the troy area resembled a relic 
of an industrial center with little prosperity 
this area was thriving and bustling with small industries that 
have disappeared from the face of the earth said bill coomley a 
lifelong troy resident 
local officials say theyre disappointed at the decision by 
sterlings owner eastman kodak co to move the pharmaceutical 
research and production plants to the philadelphia area but they 
say many firms could take sterlings place as rensselaer countys 
biggest hightech employer 
sterling plans a gradual withdrawal over two years of its 950 
research jobs and 260 production jobs the research workers will 
have the chance to relocate in pennsylvania the production workers 
wont 
technology companies are so eager to come to rensselaer county 
that if all sterlings people were gone tomorrow i could have 
that land filled up in a month said county executive john buono 
because of such institutions as rensselaer polytechnic institute 
the countrys oldest engineering school troy and its environs have 
attracted pioneers in the major industries of tomorrow officials 
said 
this area has a rich tradition of innovation said michael 
wacholder director of rpis rensselaer technology park which 
houses 35 companies dabbling in the worlds most advanced technology 
the days of the bessemer process and detachable collar are gone 
but the troy area is again at the leading edge of new ideas he said 
what were seeing is just a repeat of what happened in troy in 
the last century he said now were just on to another era 
one firm at the technology park us composites is developing 
strong lightweight composites that may replace steel in auto 
production wacholder said 
about 1000 people work in the 6yearold park selected as one 
of the countrys five top such facilities by the national 
association of university related research parks some of the 
businesses employ as many as 350 people while others have only two 
or three 
but the pioneering research each of those companies is doing now 
could blossom into major industries turning todays twoman shop 
into tomorrows 2000man shop wacholder said 
rensselaer countys jobless rate was 48 percent in april vs 
56 percent statewide and 51 percent nationwide 
like most parts of the country rensselaer county is seeing a 
rise in service sector jobs that generally pay far less than the 
manufacturing jobs that have left the area 
since 1982 the number of manufacturing jobs has been virtually 
unchanged at about 6600 said labor department spokesman james 
ross since 1982 the number of service jobs has grown by 25 percent 
to 12635 in march he said 
those service jobs officials hope will continue to make up for 
the wellpaying bluecollar jobs that inevitably disappear the last 
of troys textile jobs will be gone in july as cluett peabody amp co 
maker of arrow shirts moves its last 385 local jobs to plants in 
georgia 
recruiting employees for businesses at the technology park often 
involves no more than contacting rpi or nearby hudson valley 
community college which stresses technology programs many of the 
businesses including us composites were founded by rpi graduates 
who set up shop in the area to be near its educational resources 
ironically sterling says its moving because rensselaer county 
doesnt have the pool of trained drug researchers and the hightech 
pharmaceutical facilities that philadelphia and nearby southern new 
jersey offer 
new york officials shrug off the apparent slap at the areas 
research resources 
i think they kind of misspeak when they use that buono said 
they want to go to philly to raid existing pharmaceutical 
companies so they can build their staff faster 
unlike the mass pullouts by heavy industry from the northeast 
since the 1960s sterlings exodus is an isolated incident that 
wont be a big obstacle to creating little silicon valley local 
officials say 
whenever i heard people talk about businesses moving from the 
northeast to the sunbelt id say this is the brainbelt 
wacholder said the brains in the northeast developed the 
technology being used in california and the south the brainbelt 
survives

paramount communications inc boss martin s 
davis showed with a dramatic offer for time inc that the folks who 
gave us the indiana jones movies can jolt the takeover world 
with some hairraising stunts 
davis waited until there were 2 weeks left before time was to 
vanish into an embrace with warner communications inc before 
launching paramounts unsolicited 107 billion tender offer for 
time 
the bid enraged time executives sent wall streeters into a 
speculative buying frenzy and forced time shareholders to weigh 
where their loyalties lay 
in a stinging letter times chairman and chief executive j 
richard munro said davis bid smacks more of spite than 
strategy 
youve changed the name of your corporation but not its 
character its still engulf and devour munro wrote his 
counterpart at the company that until only recently had been called 
gulf amp western inc 
on friday time rejected paramounts offer and amended its own 
merger plan with warner by offering to pay 70 a share for all of 
warners stock rather than simply swapping stock in the new company 
for warners shares 
paramounts bid put the normally mediashy davis in the middle of 
a battle for one of the most revered companies in the american media 
business he declined to be interviewed for this story 
unlike many entertainment executives davis shuns the celebrity 
spotlight he likes riding horses tinkering with classic cars and 
practicing photography associates say and lives quietly in 
connecticuts affluent fairfield county with his second wife luella 
but he can be tough in the boardroom he was part of a group of 
outside directors at rjr nabsico inc who resisted a 17 billion 
managementled buyout offer for the company and got shareholders 25 
billion instead 
davis was born feb 5 1927 in the bronx he quit high school but 
eventually returned to get his diploma he started in the 
entertainment business as a teenage office boy for movie mogul 
samuel goldwyn 
later he worked as a publicity agent for the allied artists 
studio and joined paramount pictures in 1958 as a director of sales 
and marketing he rose to be chief operating officer 
gulf amp western acquired paramount pictures in 1966 and davis 
moved to the parent company three years later he was a top 
lieutenant to chairman charles bluhdorn 
those were the days when conglomerates were fashionable in 
corporate america epitomized by the farflung corpocracy bluhdorn 
had assembled 
gulf amp western owned companies that made cigars clothes 
bedding auto parts hydraulic presses and coinoperated videogames 
it owned sugargrowing operations in the dominican republic a pair 
of horse race tracks and a 900 million securities portfolio 
it also had operations in entertainment finance and publishing 
and these would form the core of the company after bluhdorn died of 
a heart attack while returning from the dominican republic on feb 
19 1983 
the board of directors selected davis as chief executive over two 
other likely successors to bluhdorn five days later 
irwin schloss head of the securities firm marcus schloss amp co 
inc and a gulf amp western board member for 28 years said bluhdorn 
had recognized that the street did not appreciate what he had 
built and put together and had begun the divestment process 
but davis accelerated it presiding over one of the most 
extensive corporate dissections ever 
he liquidated the stock portfolio from march 1983 through 1984 
in august 1983 the company began selling 50 businesses with 
about 13 billion in sales that failed to meet davis performance 
standards the sales produced about 360 million by 1984 
davis sold the sugargrowing business for 200 million in january 
1985 and the consumer and electrical products group for about 1 
billion that fall he sold them because they were cyclical required 
substantial capital or faced intensifying foreign competition 
even as the sales were proceeding davis began a stock repurchase 
program that retired nearly 46 million shares he bought publishing 
companies like the college textbook publisher prenticehall inc 
movie theaters he got the company more heavily involved in cable 
and broadcast television 
the companys stock price is now trading near 60 vs 9 the day 
before bluhdorn died 
its earnings have more than doubled to 3847 million or 321 a 
share for 1988 compared with 1686 million or 109 a share in 
1982 
in april davis disclosed plans to sell associates first capital 
corp taking the company out of the financial services business to 
concentrate on publishing and entertainment the sale is expected to 
generate 3 billion or more that may be used in the battle for time 
aides said davis made the choice to stay with publishing and 
entertainment because of the longlasting profit potential of books 
tv and movies 
davis points to paramounts star trek program that enjoyed a 
short run on network tv in 1960s but has spawned books five 
movies tv syndication revenue and a new syndicated series 
securities analysts who follow paramount had expected davis to 
buy something big following disclosure of plans to sell the 
associates a step that he has called the culmination of a 
sixyear strategic transformation 
they got it with paramounts 175ashare bid for time on june 7 
only 16 days before time and warner shareholders were to vote on the 
proposed time warner merger 
if davis succeeds hell have a 76 billion company bigger than 
foreign media giants such as bertelsmann of germany hachette of 
france and news corp of australia 
the buyout would come at some cost to shareholders davis told 
securities analysts paramount would have no earnings for two years 
and significantly lower dividends if the proposed takeover went 
through 
but he said the chance to buy time represents a 
onceinalifetime opportunity to maximize paramount communications 
longterm potential

eastern airlines battling to get airborne again 
despite an intractable strike and the shackles of bankruptcy court 
is facing a new and perhaps more insidious problem allegations of 
sloppy maintenance 
the airline insists these charges are groundless concoctions of 
embittered strikers who have crippled eastern for nearly four 
months 
but the federal aviation administration is monitoring easterns 
maintenance situation an influential congresswoman has expressed 
concern to the agency and sources say a criminal inquiry into the 
airlines maintenance recordkeeping at two airports is underway 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said 
the criminal investigation by the fbi and us attorneys office for 
the eastern district of new york focuses on possibly improper 
practices and allegedly falsified records at easterns john f 
kennedy international airport maintenance facility and neighboring 
laguardia 
early last month eastern surrendered its repair station 
certificate at kennedy after the faa determined the carrier had 
failed to properly record and inspect maintenance work 
assistant us attorney charles gerber said he could neither 
confirm nor deny a criminal investigation exists fbi 
representatives did not return calls seeking comment 
ira j furman an attorney and former deputy director of the 
national transportation safety board said he represents a former 
eastern maintenance manager who has talked to the faa fbi and the 
us attorneys office about alleged violations that occurred at 
least a year ago at laguardia 
the lawyer wouldnt identify his client who worked at laguardia 
but said he has been granted immunity in an investigation of the 
violations in which furman said falsified records led to 
contaminated fuel 
the spotlight of publicity turned on safety could not come at a 
worse time for miamibased eastern battered by bad news for years 
the safety question is especially sensitive because it has arisen 
periodically 
labor strife at eastern a year before the strike prompted faa 
inspectors to examine its fleet planebyplane though no 
abnormalities were found special faa reviews in 1987 resulted in an 
823000 fine 
that followed a 95 million penalty stemming from earlier 
infractions and warnings from the faa that easterns operating 
certificate faced revocation if it didnt clean up what examiners 
called a long list of deficiences 
eastern documents and memos obtained by the associated press 
depict an airline in which maintenance crews feuded with 
supervisors disaffected mechanics quit and managers ignored pilot 
protests of sloppy repairs 
we need parts eastern maintenance manager charles r 
seymour pleaded in one internal memo in march 1987 to phil bohan 
vice president of line maintenance i can assure you that the lack 
of parts is seriously affecting our performance and continuing to 
erode our manpower 
seymour director of easterns maintenance base in atlanta until 
he quit early this year also complained to superiors about an 
alarming exodus of maintenance staff and other problems in memos 
from july 1986 to january 1989 
in an april 1988 letter carlos diaz principal maintenance 
inspector in the faas miami office told edward upton easterns 
vice president of maintenance and engineering that an informal 
inspection of a miami repair station had revealed farreaching 
findings 
the deficiencies included failure to separate usable parts from 
condemned ones and failure to follow procedures for handling 
parts outlined in easterns manual diaz told upton 
management personnel are unfamiliar with repair station 
operational procedures and general housekeeping policy is not 
being adhered to by eastern personnel diaz wrote 
rep cardiss collins dill chairwoman of the house 
subcommittee on government activities and transportation has 
expressed concern to acting faa administrator robert e whittington 
that shortages of staff and spare parts could be hampering easterns 
ability to maintain its fleet 
in a june 1 letter to whittington collins said her 
subcommittees staff had reviewed internal company documents 
indicating manpower and parts shortages continue to plague the 
maintenance function of eastern 
on may 12 the faa completed a special investigation of 
recordkeeping at easterns maintenance posts in miami and atlanta 
to determine if violations of recordkeeping rules such as those 
found at kennedy were widespread 
the three airports are home to easterns principal maintenance 
facilities the final report hasnt been submitted to whittington 
but jack barker faa spokesman in atlanta said the agency told 
eastern informally that the inspection had revealed no 
irregularities 
at the same time the faa is continuing a special 
surveillance of easterns overall safety which began when workers 
struck the airline march 4 said faa spokesman fred farrar in 
washington 
suspension of the kennedy certificate was for actions that 
predated the strike which pushed eastern into bankruptcy court 
when a maintenance certificate is suspended the airline cannot 
work on planes at the facility it must contract work to others or 
ferry planes elsewhere until deficiencies at the facility are 
corrected 
questions about easterns kennedy operation and maintenance 
practices in general are like open sores in the airlines struggle 
to sidestep the strikers hire replacements and woo a skeptical 
public back to the ticket counter 
unionists accuse the company of pencilwhipping a reference 
to maintenance supervisors signing off on aircraft repairs that 
werent done 
they also charge that management frantically trying to cut costs 
and honor flying schedules during the prestrike months bullied 
mechanics and pilots who complained about serious maintenance 
violations 
it all has root in a corporate culture a corporate attitude 
greg petachenko an eastern pilot for 22 years said in a telephone 
interview their basic tool seems to have been fear and 
intimidation theres enormous pressure to keep your mouth shut 
do what youre told 
until recently eastern paid maintenance supervisors bonuses for 
meeting deadlines the company stresses however that supervisors 
also received bonuses for meeting training requirements and repair 
quality standards 
for its part eastern charges some machinists hid or destroyed 
maintenance records at kennedy then told the faa that company 
supervisors neglected to have necessary work performed 
company representatives discovered records hidden in file 
cabinets and stuffed under sofa cushions in union areas at the 
airport said eastern spokesman robin matell 
weve never dispatched an unsafe plane we have one of the best 
safety records in the industry matell said he called union 
complaints a deliberate attempt to drive away our passengers and 
weaken the company 
the safety questions havent stopped frank lorenzo chairman of 
easterns parent texas air corp from proceeding with a plan to 
rebuild eastern into a smaller carrier and sell around 18 billion 
of assets

including yuppies said anne marie thigpen a lecturer at penn state 
university who is writing a book titled outdoor decor 
even the plastic pink flamingo long considered the king of 
kitsch has migrated from ethnic working class neighborhoods to 
wellgroomed suburbs she said 
the pink flamingo is so blatantly kitsch its the only thing 
thats safe to use mrs thigpen said 
yuppies who cant quite stomach pink flamingos have altered 
existing lawn ornaments to meet their upscale sensibilities she 
said instead of a plastic duck they have a bronze crane 
national retail chains and mail order catalogues have moved to 
meet the growing demand for yard art

paramount communications inc says it is pressing 
ahead with its 107 billion unsolicited bid for time inc although 
time has rejected paramounts proposal and announced its own 14 
billion tender offer for warner communications inc 
most observers said the offer announced friday complicated the 
struggle for time which is trying to preserve the merger with 
warner announced in march 
time outlined a twostage tender offer under which it would pay 
70 a share in cash for 100 million warner shares in a tender offer 
and then exchange 70 a share in cash and securities for the 
remaining 100 million shares of warner stock 
time stock slumped 9 to 16250 a share in new york stock 
exchange consolidated trading friday warner rose 362 to 5925 a 
share and paramount fell 137 to 5812 
analysts said there was still speculation on wall street that the 
paramount bid might succeed and that prevented time stock from 
falling further 
times rejection of the paramount 175ashare bid which ended 
10 days of silence on the offer said it was not in the best 
interests of time because the bid was financially inadequate and 
highly conditional 
time officials said they anticipated a higher offer from 
paramount but they believed paramount still would ultimately fail 
because its offer was conditioned on acquiring rights to some 800 
cable system franchises that time now holds 
time president nicholas j nicholas said in an interview friday 
there has never been a hostile takeover of a cable franchise and he 
predicted paramount would be unable to operate the systems and 
therefore would not have the assets needed to secure its takeover 
debt 
if you cant get hold of the assets you cant get hold of the 
bank loan he said 
time officials also said they were betting stockholders would not 
want to wait for paramount to complete the regulatory process which 
time estimated could take as long as a year 
some observers have cautioned that the bid for warner could open 
the company up to a higher bid by a third party but warner chairman 
steven ross discounted that possibility friday 
paramount called times bid for warner a defensive device pure 
and simple 
from the standpoint of time shareholders we dont see how it 
begins to compare with our offer of 175 a share in cash for all 
share paramount stated 
industry analysts have said the stock price of a combined 
timewarner is unlikely to rise to the 175ashare level for two 
years nicholas vehemently disagreed and said the combined cash 
flow of a timewarner would be high enough to improve the stocks 
value 
a bid for warner widely had been seen as a possible defensive 
action by time but analysts said it did little to resolve the fight 
fred anschel of dean witter reynolds inc said the bid fails to 
specify the exact breakdown of the cash and securities in the second 
tier of the buyout and did not adequately explain how the deal would 
be financed 
however nicholas ross and time chairman j richard munro said 
in an interview that the timewarner cash flow would be enough to 
service the debt resulting from the merger 
time and warner also announced friday they had carried out a 
stock swap provided for under their earlier merger agreement the 
stock swap was intended to defend an unsolicited bid for either 
company 
time also sued to block paramount from taking any steps to 
disrupt the merger of time and warner communications inc 
the suit filed at federal court in manhattan alleged paramount 
violated securities laws and sought a preliminary injunction to 
prevent paramount from trying to acquire time stock and making or 
attempting to make any tender offer for times securities 
the lawsuit alleged that paramount made false and misleading 
statements in its tender offer 
paramounts statement called the suit a continuation of the 
publicity campaign time has been waging 
paul alexandrakis an analyst with argus research inc said he 
expected shareholders to determine the outcome of the fight either 
by tendering their shares or in formal votes 
however alexandrakis said you might wonder why someone would 
tender to time rather than paramount at this point with the 
divergence in price 
time and warner agreed in march to merge in an allstock deal 
under which time stockholders would get a share in the new company 
timewarner inc for each time share while warner shareholders 
would get 0465 of a share of the new company for each of their 
warner shares 
paramount formerly called gulf amp western inc announced its bid 
for time on june 6 just 2 weeks before time and warner 
shareholders were to vote on the proposed merger the tender offer 
was formally launched the next day 
time and warner did not immediately say whether their shareholder 
meetings scheduled for june 23 would take place

the revisions in the merger agreement between 
time inc and warner communications inc would leave the new company 
laden with more debt and warner shareholders facing potential tax 
liabilities 
but the companies say even they dont know how much that debt 
burden would be because they have not yet worked out the second 
phase of times proposed twostep buyout of warners stock 
the latest plan was announced friday in an attempt to thwart a 
hostile 175 a share buyout offer from paramount communications inc 
that values time at 107 billion 
in their original merger plan disclosed march 4 time 
shareholders would have received one new share in the new company 
for each time share and warner shareholders would get 0465 shares 
in the new company for every warner share 
the resulting company would have had about 150 million shares 
but time president nj nicholas jr said the marketplace 
indicated through times stock price it was unhappy with the 
terms of that agreement 
it was telling us you didnt do the right deal he said in 
an interview 
in the past 10 days the time and warner boards negotiated a 
revision in the merger agreement that call for time to make a tender 
offer for warner 
under that plan time will offer 70 a share for 100 million of 
warners approximately 200 million shares 
that portion of the deal would cost 7 billion and warner 
shareholders who may have acquired their stock for less than 70 a 
share would face a potential capital gains tax liability upon 
tendering their shares 
in the second phase of the deal each remaining warner share will 
be converted for an asyet unspecified combination of cash stock or 
debt 
both phases of the warner buyout would cost a total of about 14 
billion warner would also bring 1 billion in debt to the new 
company boosting the total value of the merger to about 15 billion 
the companies said a bank group led by manufacturers hanover 
corp and bankers trust co already have committed to provide 15 
billion for the deal and have said they can arrange up 14 billion 
in additional financing 
time and warner also said their combined cash flow after a merger 
would be adequate to service their debt load 
if the second phase of the deal excludes issuance of new stock 
time would be left with about 57 million shares the same as it has 
now 
but warner and time officials hope that the market will value the 
time shares more highly because the new company will have a 
substantially broader asset base
