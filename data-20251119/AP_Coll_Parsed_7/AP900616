huge oil tankers steaming along the 
pacific coast from alaska could be joined next year by ships 
carrying water to droughtstricken southern california city 
officials said friday 
water has become so scarce in santa barbara that its a crime 
for a homeowner to hose down his lawn the gives away lowflow 
shower heads and offers 80 each to people who switch from 
bigflush to smallflush toilets 
the water tanker idea is one of three being considered by the 
city to ease the drought said city spokesman pete ramsdell 
the city is negotiating with three companies on a proposal to 
import thousands of gallons from canada another idea is to 
construct a 50 million desalination plant that would turn sea 
water into drinking water said ramsdell 
the city staff will recommend to the city council on july 31 
which idea is worth pursuing further ramsdell said 
santa barbara is not connected to either northern california or 
colorado river supplies and must rely entirely on local sources for 
water thus it has been the southern california city hardest hit by 
the regions 4yearold drought 
city officials made it clear earlier this year they would listen 
to just about anyone with an idea on how to get them more water 
thats where the water tanker idea came in ramsdell said 
proposals rom two canadian companies and a santa barbara firm are 
currently being studied 
officials of the local company sun belt water inc met with 
city officials friday said richard schuller the companys 
president 
the company has proposed using tankers to bring in 14000 
acrefeet of water per trip from british columbias toba inlet 
sun belts partner in the deal british columbiabased water 
bottler snowcap ltd is one of several companies already licensed 
by the canadian province to export fresh water 
ramsdell said the city which used about 16000 acrefeet of 
water a year before the drought wants to import at least 5000 
acrefeet a year of water 
schuller noting his company proposed bringing in far more than 
that said the rest could be sold to other water users in santa 
barbara county 
schuller said his company made an initial bid of 2700 per 
acrefoot the costs would cover installing terminals in canada and 
california for drawing and unloading the water he said 
we would own the facilities and operate the ships he said

communist spies are coming in from the 
cold throughout germany and officials are trying to lure others 
from possible soviet recruitment with suggestions of amnesty 
for 40 years east german agents using west germany as their 
western base stole vital defense and technological secrets wrecked 
one west german government and turned the german states into the 
espionage battleground of the cold war 
with the collapse of the east german communist government and 
the rapidly approaching merger of the two germanys officials say 
the former adversaries are cooperating in addition many former 
spooks are talking some in hopes of bettering their fate in a 
unified germany 
as you can imagine the information flows quite freely because 
we have former stasi officials who come to us and speak very 
frankly and freely said lutz stavenhagen a security expert in 
chancellor helmut kohls government 
stasi in german is short for the old east german ministry for 
state security which included domestic and foreign intelligence 
agents 
west german espionage experts estimate there are up to 6000 
spies in west germany including east german agents and west german 
defectors but they wont say how many are known to authorities 
the treaty that outlines the conditions for the economic and 
social unification of the two german states does not address the 
espionage issue 
what to do with the spies has become a very very tricky 
matter said one west german government official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
an amnesty has been suggested 
they must think about it because otherwise there would be 
too many people at risk to be punished on both sides of the former 
german border said hansgert lange spokesman for the federal 
office for the protection of the constitution 
adding impetus to an amnesty proposal is the fear the soviets 
are recruiting agents 
we know that obviously the soviet secret service the kgb is 
trying to get hold of the most efficient of these agents 
stavenhagen said in an interview wednesday 
he said officials have tried to counter that by urging them to 
turn themselves in to avoid persecution 
a similar situation developed after world war ii as both the 
soviets and western allies scrambled to recruit the top agents who 
had worked in hitlers secret service 
stavenhagen said the most likely outcome for agents in west 
germany would be an amnesty for the normal spy looking into 
boxes and papers and that sort of thing but the basic 
condition is that they turn themselves over 
top spies ones the west germans say have blood on their 
hands would not qualify for an amnesty he said 
a different amnesty perhaps one without conditions would 
probably apply to the spies in east germany who worked for the 
branch of stasi that spied on the west one west german government 
espionage expert who spoke on condition of anonymity estimated 
there were about 12000 such spies 
its bad enough but what can you do at the time they did it 
they didnt do something illegal according to gdr east german 
laws stavenhagen said 
two top targets in east germany are markus wolf former head of 
east german espionage and former senior west german 
counterintelligence official hansjoachim tiedge who fled to the 
east with vital secrets stavenhagen said they probably would not 
qualify for amnesty 
west german officials have alleged in the last several weeks 
that wolf is helping the kgb set up a new spy network a charge he 
denies 
in an interview with junge welt the east german youth 
newspaper wolf termed as absolute nonsense speculation that 
the kgb had taken over complete groups of former east german spies 
however in another interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung he 
said he could not rule out the possibility that individual spies 
had gone over to moscow of their own will 
a decision on how to handle the spies is expected before formal 
german unification which stavenhagen estimated would be before 
years end 
one government official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said a decision could be ready in two weeks but that because of 
the sensitivity of the issue it probably would not be announced 
until a majority of the governing coalition was assured 
in the meantime the two german interior ministers are in very 
close cooperation stavenhagen said 
from the eastern part of germany a substantial number of 
spies have come here and we have very valuable information 
from them so those still hiding hoping that they wouldnt be 
detected i think are doing the wrong thing

miners among the most outspoken 
critics of the former communist rulers have become the shock 
troops of presidentelect ion iliescu during antigovernment 
protests 
neglected during more than four decades of communist rule the 
miners have enjoyed the biggest rewards of the december revolution 
that toppled dictator nicolae ceausescu higher salaries more food 
and less work 
though their presence in the pits is vital to the countrys 
growing energy needs iliescu and his ruling national salvation 
front have called miners to bucharest three times since the 
revolution to act against government opponents 
while iliescu has pledged to move romania toward a freemarket 
pluralistic society he has relied on the tactics of the former 
hardline communists rather than western standards of democratic 
dialogue to deal with protest 
traditionally when communist bosses thought their political 
fate was in danger they asked the workers to come and help them 
said stelian tanase editor of the anticommunist weekly 22 
now the neocommunists largely making up the front are 
appealing to the miners viewed as the workers advance guard who 
received everything they wanted from the government tanase said 
in a controlled communist society the shows of support posed 
little danger but relying on such tactics during a turbulent 
postrevolutionary period has proved bloody and destabilizing 
observers said 
iliescus game is a very dangerous one using the miners 
against other civilian groups such as students and intellectuals 
can lead to unforeseen consequencessaid emil hurezeanu a 
romanian exile and editor at munichbased radio free europe 
iliescu still thinks as a communist people like him who have 
been trained as communists since childhood cannot discard the mold 
too easily wrote vladimir tismaneanu a professor of romanian 
stock who lives in philadelphia in the independent newspaper 
romania libera 
until the december revolution that deposed and executed former 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu romanias 70000 miners 
worked more and received less pay and food than their soviet bloc 
colleagues 
most work in mountainous western transylvania dominated the 
largest coal basin of the jiu valley where 30000 coal miners went 
on strike in 1977 demanding a fiveday week sixhour day free hot 
meal and retirement at 50 
ceausescu taken aback by the biggest work protest in communist 
romania initially gave in but later rescinded most concessions 
the now disbanded secret police arrested hundreds of miners and 
their leaders disappeared 
the front a loose organization of excommunists technocrats 
and industrial workers set to improving the living standard of 
workers especially the vocal miners shortly after taking power 
in the revoution 
in january iliescu 60 a former communist party secretary met 
miners leaders and agreed to their demands adding alpine chalets 
as a bonus 
according to some romanians iliescus aim was primarily to 
appease miners but they said that at the same time he may have 
realized he could manipulate them to the fronts advantage 
days later iliescu made a televised appeal for their support to 
counter a major antigovernment demonstration thousands of miners 
arrived in bucharest and attacked an opposition party headquarters 
corneliu coposu president of the national peasants party had to 
be rescued by an armored personnel carrier 
on feb 19 a day after opposition demonstrators stormed and 
ransacked government headquarters 5000 miners came to bucharest 
again to show support for the front they warned they would return 
in case of further trouble 
early thursday thousands of miners poured into bucharest at the 
governments request after antigovernment demonstrators stormed 
and set fire to police and interior ministry buildings 
the violence started early wednesday when clubwielding police 
routed anticommunist demonstrators who had blocked university 
square for 53 days 
operating as vigilantes or paramilitary groups the helmeted 
miners their faces smudged with coal dust stopped cars checked 
identities made home searches confiscated or destroyed property 
and clubbed anyone they wanted 
its clear that they had all the logistical support provided 
by the government a western analyst said on condition of 
anonymity 
they came on buses or trains from as far away as maramures 
300 miles northwest of bucharest and in the capital they were 
given food and milk from army trucks the whole thing was well 
organized the analyst said

viorel budulacu beaten up during a 
crackdown on antigovernment demonstrations says he suffered more 
than cuts and bruises he also lost his idealism 
the only chance is to defect flee from romania said the 
25yearold student 
like many students who helped spearhead the december revolution 
that toppled nicolae ceausescu budulacu said he has lost faith in 
presidentelect ion iliescu 
iliescu and his national salvation front won the may 20 
elections but the protesters say they are continuing ceausescus 
repressive policies 
budulacu a sophomore at bucharest polytechnic was one of 367 
people hurt since police broke up a 53dayold peaceful 
anticommunist protest at downtown university square on wednesday 
that action touched off fierce street violence that claimed five 
lives when security forces opened fire on crowds attacking them 
iliescu called for help in quelling the antigovernment 
demonstrations and thousands of coal miners responded by pouring 
into the capital and brutally beating anyone they suspected of 
being an opponent of the government 
marius dinu 22 an architecture student and university square 
protester told reporters at the emergency hospital on friday he 
has no hope left for romania 
i dont know whats awaiting me i would like to leave the 
country for good and forget all about the hopes the revolution 
has given me dinu said 
dinu was hospitalized after being clubbed punched and kicked by 
miners thursday morning in the school of architecture on the square 
they threw us on top of each other into a moaning pile he 
said 
emergency hospital director mihai ciuta told a news conference 
friday that 48 of the 236 injured people treated at his facility 
since wednesday morning remained hospitalized most with multiple 
injuries 
marian munteanu president of the students league and one of 
the leaders of the antigovernment protest has a fractured skull 
and broken left leg and arm dr horia georgescu said 
munteaunu speaking from the emergency ward said he believed 
iliescus rule was doomed to fail 
i wouldnt like to be in iliescus place i believe in god and 
one day we will all have to answer gods questions for whatever we 
have done he said 
its a long way to democracy said munteaunu close to 
tears you are now watching a growing dictator 
iliescu was shown on state television friday night thanking the 
miners with all my heart for defending his government 
marius dobrescu beaten by paramilitary police when he and other 
demonstrators stormed the state television building is now in 
intensive care he said he also wants to leave romania 
i am sorry i survived ceausescus times and i find myself 
wanting to leave the country again dobrescu said

israel is fast running out of housing for 
soviet jews and the country could face a severe shortage by years 
end 
government officials say more than 43000 soviet jews have 
arrived this year and the influx has pushed up rents in some 
areas fueling protests by young israelis that they are being 
priced out of the housing market 
if something isnt done soon we are going to have a social 
explosion warned jerusalems deputy mayor avraham kehila 
the emigration of soviet jews to israel has been running at 
record levels since moscow relaxed exit policies in the spring of 
1989 and the united states subsequently tightened its immigration 
rules 
nearly 13000 soviets came to israel in 1989 the 1990 total is 
expected to exceed 150000 israeli officials say 
uri shoshani director of engineering and planning in the 
housing ministry said israels estimated 20000 vacant rental 
units will be filled in four months 
three months later israel will have exhausted its supply of 
alternate housing such as holiday flats army camps and 
offseason hotel rooms he said 
he said the ministry has asked that 60000 new units be built 
this year or three times the rate of recent years 
but so far ground has been broken for only 7000 new homes 
shoshani said were building as fast as we can but were worried 
that there just wont be enough housing to go around shoshani 
said 
the shortage already is apparent in the modestpriced units that 
soviet immigrant families can afford on government housing 
subsidies of 237 monthly 
a recent survey by the hebrew daily hadashot showed rental 
prices had risen significantly in suburban nazareth monthly rents 
for twobedroom units have risen from 80 to 200 in the past year 
hadashot said in rishon lezion near tel aviv rents have doubled 
to 600 and in jerusalem they are up 150 percent to 450 the 
paper said 
the increase has come about because landlords have raised rents 
on the cheapest apartments to match the soviets monthly subsidy 
that drives up rents all down the line 
in israel the average monthly aftertax income for a family of 
four is 1160 many young israelis say they cannot compete with 
soviets for housing and they have begun forming protest groups to 
seek government help 
in beersheva in the southern negev desert scores of university 
students young couples and recently discharged soldiers staged a 
sitdown protest to demand affordable housing they have formed a 
group called young people without apartments to press their 
concerns 
rafi luzan a 36yearold factory worker from carmiel near 
haifa went on a hunger strike earlier this month after his rent 
was raised to 300 from 150 he was forced to move out of his flat 
with his wife and their son 
luzan who earns 650 a month is encouraging people thrown out 
of their homes to live in tents outside carmiels municipal 
building until their plight is resolved 
rents have doubled all over town and working people and young 
couples dont have the money to pay for it luzan told israel 
radio 
hana koval spokeswoman for the carmiel government warned of 
a social catastrophe if emergency measures arent taken soon 
she said carmiel officials wanted the israeli government to buy 
up unsold houses and apartments and rent them at subsidized rates 
to israelis town officials also have called for rent controls

an archaeological team is sifting through 
a sierra nevada campsite for remnants from the final days of george 
and jacob donner whose dreams of life in sunny california ended 
near here in icy disaster 
the two brothers from illinois and most of their party died 144 
years ago when a raging october snowstorm halted their westward 
trek and sealed their fate 
donald hardesty an archaeologist at the university of nevada 
reno is leading a team of students and volunteers in an effort to 
pinpoint the exact whereabouts of the brothers last camp at alder 
creek 
this camp is not nearly as well known or understood through 
written accounts he said thursday 
the donner families stopped at alder creek when a wagon axle 
broke the rest of the party continued to a lake about five miles 
away now known as donner lake 
incessant snow trapped both groups for six months in 18461847 
as starvation set in they ate boiled hides for nourishment when 
those were gone they turned to the flesh of their comrades who 
died of weakness 
of the 87 people who became stranded 39 survived nine of the 
12 adults and nine children with the donner families lived to see 
the spring the donner brothers did not 
hardesty said it is believed george donner used tree limbs 
propped against a giant ponderosa pine that still towers over the 
site and covered them with animal hides and quilts for a shelter 
jacob donner created a similar leanto for his family about 200 
yards away 
hardesty hopes to uncover the location of a third camp believed 
to have been used by teamsters traveling with the families 
armed with buckets brushes trowels and sifters 19 students 
and 10 volunteers sifted the soil near the two sites on thursday in 
the joint venture of the university and the us forest service 
as the excavating team worked in the warm june sunshine yellow 
and purple wildflowers bloomed in a nearby meadow and the sweet 
scent of sagebrush perfumed the air but almost as a reminder of 
the task gray clouds hugged the snowcapped peaks of the sierra 
hardesty said the group hopes to find small items and fragments 
at alder creek 
he said diaries were kept by those at the donner lake cabins 
but no writings have been found near the alder creek site 
hardesty participated in a 1984 excavation of the donner lake 
site where bone fragments cloth remnants chips of pottery and 
hardware were uncovered the most significant find there he said 
was a bronze roman catholic medallion

an appeals court reversed convictions for 
murder and manslaughter stemming from a 1987 slaying because jurors 
visited the crime site on their own to assess the evidence 
unauthorized visits to the crime scene are condemned the 
1st district court of appeal said in a ruling released friday the 
state court in a 30 decision said the observations by two jurors 
contradicted important defense testimony in the case 
the court granted a new trial to dana deweese of castro valley 
and his sister deanna joao joaos lawyer kyle gee said she 
already has served most of her fouryear sentence for manslaughter 
deweese was sentenced to 17 years to life for seconddegree murder 
they were convicted of the august 1987 killing of kenneth tyrone 
jackson after a brawl between the deweeses and a neighbor family at 
a birthday party 
prosecution witnesses said jackson was not holding a weapon or 
making threatening gestures when deweese standing 15 to 20 feet 
away shot him with a gun his sister allegedly had given him they 
said deweese was standing between his brother duane and jackson 
but deweese testified that jackson was pointing a knife at 
duane five or six feet away and attempting to stab him when 
deweese fired into the ground to scare jackson he said the gun 
accidentally went off a second time and hit jackson about 40 feet 
away 
after the verdict two jurors margaret westberg and daniel 
freeman told a defense investigator they had visited the site 
during the trial freeman said he had concluded that deweese had 
been less than 25 feet from jackson 
freemans unauthorized observations contradicted deweeses 
testimony supported prosecution testimony that deweeses brother 
was not in danger and caused the juror to question deweeses 
credibility said the opinion by presiding justice harry low 
by wrongly viewing the crime scene the juror was improperly 
influenced against defendants version of the shooting low said 
alameda county superior court judge stanley golde ruled that the 
declarations did not require a new trial but was overruled by the 
appeals court

nearly a million people have been asked 
to conserve water after farmers failed to block a hole in a canal 
that supplies bristol and surrounding communities 
a culvert collapsed thursday night beneath the gloucester and 
sharpness canal north of this city of about 375000 located about 
100 miles west of london 
farmers threw straw bales barrels and an old farm gate wrapped 
in plastic into the whirlpool created by water rushing through the 
hole but could not stem the leak 
the collapse of the culvert allowed more than a million gallons 
of water to escape 
it was like a bath without the plug in but on an enormous 
scale said jeremy williams spokesman for the bristol water 
company 
the 18mile canal carries more than 30 million gallons of water 
a day to serve an area around bristol of more than 1000 square 
miles the leak reduced the water supply by twothirds williams 
said 
we do not yet know what caused the collapse but the culvert 
is 170 years old and it might have just given up williams said 
adding that repairs were expected to take a week 
about a million customers were asked to conserve water while 
supplies from reservoirs in the mendip hills were pumped in

sveta and oleg have signed up to marry but they 
wont be around to hear the wedding bells theyll be too busy 
shopping 
in an illustration of how desperate soviets are for food and 
consumer goods sveta and oleg have applied to marry just to get 
the right to shop in a special store for brides and grooms 
when they applied wedded bliss was the furthest thing from 
their minds although the couple is in love and living together 
olegs thoughts were on an imported mans suit cuff links gold or 
silver wedding rings and imported shoes svetas were on her own 
ring imported shoes pantyhose and mascara 
for both it was a chance to shop in gemini part of a 
nationwide chain of stores that is an oasis in a desert of deficits 
here is how the scam works a single or divorced soviet finds a 
partner and applies to marry at a government registration office 
they pay a 15ruble 24 fee the couple is assigned a date for an 
official ceremony and is given a prized booklet of coupons for the 
gemini store as well as food shops meant to supply wedding parties 
the couple can shop at the stores until the wedding day when 
the coupons expire they dont show up for the official wedding 
and their marriage application is automatically voided 
then they can start all over again and if their faces become 
too familiar at the registration office they can just go to 
another 
thats why sveta and oleg have no intention of getting married 
the scam is so lucrative that sveta has applied to marry three 
times since november once with oleg twice with his friends 
thousands are participating onethird of all soviets applying 
to marry do so only so they can shop in the special stores state 
televisions breakfast show 120 minutes reported in april 
and that does not include other matches that are made merely so 
one partner can obtain a residence permit in a city where the other 
lives 
looking for loopholes even in such a sacred institution as 
marriage has become a survival technique in a system that has 
failed to offer soviets the food and consumer goods they want 
its the situation in this state which leads people to such 
things where you cant spend money on anything except lowquality 
food said viktor a 31yearold muscovite like oleg viktor 
applied to marry a friend of his girlfriend in may so they could 
obtain access to the special store 
theres such a terrible deficit you cant buy anything in the 
regular stores said sveta a 28yearold eye doctor she 
declined to give her surname fearing its publication would help 
authorities track her down 
the fear was largely unfounded because what she and the 
thousands of other soviets are doing is not illegal 
its a moral not a legal issue said valentina borzhenkova 
director of moscows wedding palace no 1 where weddings are 
performed its everyones right if all formalities are 
followed 
if all the offices had computers this couldnt happen 
because they could check whether you have applied at more than 
one sveta said but computers are as rare as efficient 
bureaucrats in the soviet government so couples can apply as often 
as they like 
the bureaucrats admit they are powerless to end the practice 
it will stop only when there are no deficits in the country 
mrs borzhenkova said 
at the gemini store sveta has bought american shoes virtually 
unavailable elsewhere in the soviet union and gold rings she 
travels to a nearby socialist country and and resells the rings 
at a hefty profit other goods also have a handsome return 
imported womens shoes bought at gemini for 55 rubles 89 can be 
peddled on the black market for 150 rubles 243 she said 
the special stores however are not a completely reliable 
source perhaps because of the high number of fictitious marriages 
even the special stores have sporadic supplies and long lines 
sometimes a six hourwait 
if you want everything you must go every day and still 
theres no guarantee youll get everything you want sveta said 
one day this month gemini where only customers holding a 
coupon booklet are admitted was selling 400ruble 648 gold 
rings and 55ruble 89 womens shoes from yugoslavia and hungary 
aside from its treasure trove of goods the store is set apart 
in other ways it is well lit clean and colorful with decorations 
in a celestial theme 
but there is an even better shop nearby for couples celebrating 
their 25th and 50th anniversaries sveta would love to get into 
that one but admits with a laugh unfortunately grandmothers 
and grandfathers wont run back and forth to the registration 
offices

president bush said he must ensure the 
integrity of the civil service as he vetoed a bill relaxing 
51yearold curbs on the offduty political activity of government 
workers 
two days after the senate upheld his 11th veto an authorization 
bill for amtrak bush cast the 12th veto of his presidency no bush 
veto has yet been overturned 
the hatch act has upheld the integrity of the civil service by 
assuring that federal employees are hired and promoted based upon 
their qualifications and not their political loyalties he said 
friday in a veto message to congress 
robert tobias president of the national treasury employees 
union representing federal employees in 16 agencies and 
departments called the veto wrongheaded and urged the senate 
to override it 
tobias urged lawmakers to hold fast to their commitment to 
federal workers 
he said in a statement senators must maintain their 
courageous support of reform and not trade their collective 
conscience for white house cuff links or breakfast with bush 
republican leaders have said they expect to be able to sustain 
the veto even though the bill passed by more than the twothirds 
majorities that would be needed to override 
the hatch act revision would affect 3 million federal employees 
and postal workers who are now prohibited from participating in 
any form of political activity beyond voting 
sent to bush by a 33487 house vote on wednesday the bill would 
allow government employees to work in political campaigns on their 
own time hold office in a political party and attend political 
conventions 
however the measure would leave intact prohibitions against 
running for partisan political office and soliciting money from the 
public 
sponsors said the measure would extend some of the same 
fundamental freedoms now enjoyed by most americans to federal and 
postal workers 
but bush said he was opposed to any tinkering with the hatch 
act passed in 1939 to prevent depressionera government workers 
from being pressured to work for president franklin d roosevelts 
reelection effort 
bush said the easing would inevitably lead to 
repoliticizing the government bureaucracy 
it has been manifestly successful over the years in shielding 
civil servants and the programs they administer from political 
exploitation and abuse bush wrote 
we cannot afford in the final decade of this century to 
embark on a retreat into the very worst aspects of public 
administration from the last century he said 
the senate passed the same bill last month by a vote of 6730 
that would be just enough for a veto override but gop senate 
leaders have expressed confidence they can persuade one or two of 
their colleagues to change votes 
in sending the bill back to congress with a veto bush told 
lawmakers as one who has devoted much of his life to public 
service i take great pride in the integrity of our federal work 
force

the pet product industrys annual trade show is 
not a place dogs would find rough rough rough 
its a world where dogs strut in tshirts and neon sun visors 
fish live in designer aquariums and birds eat from national 
football league helmet feeders 
the 485 booths at the american pet products manufacturers 
association show have such standard fare as pet foods kitty litter 
and bird cages but also offbeat items 
there is a full line of nfllicensed items that identify pets 
with their favorite team or at least the team of their owner 
its important to get kids and adults to think about their 
pets and bring them into the family not just look at them as 
disposable things said karen long macleod editor of the trade 
publication pet age those products are designed to keep pets 
healthy and to have fun 
anne mcdowell senior licensing manager for nfl properties inc 
said the idea for the nfl pet products came from a dinner party 
attended by a league official in pittsburgh where the hosts had 
knit a steelers sweater for their dog 
when the nfl decided to sanction pet products bearing team 
logos ms mcdowell said we decided dont do it piecemeal go 
all the way lets do everything 
animal tshirts sweaters dinner bowls beds collars and bird 
feeders all bear nfl insignias 
theres a variety pack of rawhide chews in the shapes of 
helmets footballs jerseys and pennants

president bush no longer opposes an 
international fund to help poor nations phase out ozonedepleting 
chemicals and is joining other world leaders in calling for such 
action the white house says 
the bush administration is willing to contribute 25 million to 
a fund expected to total about 100 million over three years said 
one administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity no 
figures were officially released in fridays announcement that the 
administration will push for a fund 
in the policy reversal the white house announced it will 
propose establishing a fund to help third world countries at an 
international meeting next week in london 
us opposition to the fund had threatened to disrupt the 
conference where participating nations will consider changes to 
strengthen the 1987 socalled montreal protocol to phase out 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs by the turn of the century 
us officials recognized that failing to help the developing 
nations particularly heavy cfc producers such as china and india 
would alienate them and keep them from signing the pending update 
of the montreal protocol said the administration source 
the white house announcement brought praise from capitol hill 
the ranking republican on the senate environment and public 
works committee sen john chafee of rhode island said it was 
tremendously good news coming as it does on the eve of the 
london meeting 
a democratic critic of bushs environmental policies sen al 
gore of tennessee said the decision was predictable because the 
original policy was completely out of touch with the reality 
he said the united states was the last holdout among 
nations instead of providing leadership they try to block any 
progress then begrudgingly admit the obvious he said 
before fridays announcement the administration had maintained 
that any assistance to third world nations for phasing out cfcs 
should come from existing world bank resources and not new funds 
but world bank officials said it could not afford such a program 
white house spokesman steve hart said a key to the policy change 
was that the administrations plan calls for a new fund but within 
the existing world bank structure rather than setting up a 
completely new organization to administer the fund 
earlier this week mustafa k tolba of egypt head of the un 
environment program said us opposition to the financial aid fund 
suggested by a number of european countries last month threatened 
to unravel the montreal protocol the treaty calls for reducing cfc 
production by 50 percent by the end of the century the pending 
amendments would call for complete phaseout by that time 
cfcs used widely as refrigerants and as aerosol propellants 
are depleting the ozone layer which protects the earth from 
harmful levels of ultraviolet rays scientists say 
hart said internal discussion among administration officials 
with input from other governments led to the switch in policy 
we have found that were at a point where we feel such a 
fund is warranted he said 
one country pressuring the united states to change its stance 
was britain said an administration source 
specifics of the plan such as how the aid would be 
disseminated were to be worked out in the london negotiations 
us officials are expected to push for a system under which the 
largest contributors would have the most say in where the money 
goes 
a world bank official hailed the white house announcement as 
the beginning of a chance for real dialogue on the cfc question 
the white house statement was put out under the name of chief of 
staff john sununu who has been criticized by environmentalists for 
blocking other environmental initiatives activists have criticized 
the administration for what they call footdragging on eliminating 
cfcs

defense secretary dick cheney is attempting to 
ease the strain in usisraeli relations by promising that america 
will continue to support its allys military edge in the volatile 
middle east 
but cheney also cautioned that ussupplied weaponry wont 
ensure israels security unless successful negotiations with 
palestinians and arab states take place 
cheney speaking friday before the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith in new york city stressed americas commitment to 
peace in the mideast as well as its solid and unalterable ties 
to israel 
the secretary also made a point of congratulating the new 
government of prime minister yitzhak shamir saying the 
administration looks forward to working with him to secure a 
comprehensive peace between israel and the palestinians and between 
israel and all of its arab neighbors 
the secretarys remarks were monitored by reporters in the 
pentagon 
cheney made no direct mention of the sharp remarks exchanged in 
recent days between secretary of state james a baker iii and 
shamir over israels commitment to the peace process 
but he did note that all is not well between the two allies 
the important thing in a good relationship is to remember that 
disagreements are not all there is he said 
cheney said that while both nations have had our differences 
of opinion about how best to pursue the peace process there is 
not an ally in the world with whom we have not had an occasional 
disagreement 
strategic cooperation between the two nations has become 
closer than ever and israel is in line to receive 35 percent of 
the administrations fiscal 1991 budget request for security 
assistance cheney said 
israel is to begin taking delivery on its third order of f16 
fighter jets next year will be getting its first delivery of 
apache attack helicopters and is getting funds to upgrade its navy 
the secretary added 
israel has received around 31 billion a year in a combination 
of military and economic aid from the united states 
cheney advised however that such aid is not the path to peace 
in the volatile mideast 
israel must remain strong to secure that peace but weapons 
and technology alone are not sufficient cheney said real 
security can only come through successful negotiations with 
palestinians and arab states that leads to a durable peace 
cheney also put in a plug for his defense budget request saying 
that the us commitment to israels security depends on our 
ability to project american power 
even though budgets are shrinking the united states must 
continue to fund a highly trained mobile and lethal fighting force 
to protect its interests around the world he argued 
some people who like to portray themselves as great friends of 
israel are also in the forefront of those who want to cut the heart 
out of the defense budget cheney said i believe those two 
positions are fundamentally incompatible we in the united states 
must not let ourselves become just another regional power if we 
do we and our friends such as israel may well suffer the 
consequences 
baker testifying before a senate committee on wednesday urged 
israels new rightwing government to move to restart the stalled 
peace process 
he sarcastically recited the telephone number of the white house 
switchboard and said when youre serious about peace call us 
in return shamir blamed us criticism of israel for stirring 
up growing arab hostility toward the jewish state 
aggressive intentions begin to surface in the arab world 
as soon as they see cracks or breaches in the wall of friendship 
between israel and the united states shamir said in an interview 
published friday in the jerusalem post

aid to romania where miners backing the government beat up 
journalists and raided the offices of opposition parties 
the state department in a statement read by spokesman richard 
boucher also said an envoy would go to bucharest to express 
american concern to the romanian government 
the statement urged romanian presidentelect ion iliescu to 
clear all worker vigilantes from the streets and publicly pledge 
that they will not be encouraged or allowed to reenter 
the actions authorized by president iliescu and his government 
in the past few days strike at the very heart of romanian 
democracy boucher said

iliescu called for their help to put down what he called fascist 
forces demonstrating against his government the miners beat 
pedestrians and journalists and raided the offices of opposition 
parties 
the us ambassador to romania alan green jr will be sent to 
bucharest to convey to the romanian leadership the seriousness of 
our concern boucher said green has been in washington for 
consultations 
boucher said the united states would go ahead with 80 million 
in food aid and 1 million in medical aid that had already been 
announced but washington 
has decided to withhold all nonhumanitarian support 
assistance that romania might be eligible for he said 
the department said earlier that such assistance of an 
unspecified nature was under consideration such aid often takes 
the form of export credits and government loans 
the spokesman said the aid would be withheld until the 
democratic process is restored in romania 
iliescu should provide public guarantees of safety for leaders 
and members of all political parties and those who exercise their 
legitimate right of dissent and should reopen independent 
newspapers and magazines that were attacked on thursday boucher 
said 
we urge president iliescu and his government to engage 
opposition parties and other groups in dialogue to repair the 
damage to romanian democracy caused by events of the past few 
days he said

americans are vacationing from the amazon to the 
himalayas fueling a phenomenon called adventure tourism that 
has unleashed protests over the footprints left behind 
adventure tourism accounts for 10 percent of the us travel 
industry or 13 billion a year and no one knows how big it will 
grow 
the debate is heating up over the impact of tourist intrusion on 
some of the most remote and ecologically fragile regions left in 
the world including antarctica and the galapagos islands 
the expeditions are growing in popularity particularly among 
older americans with money to burn and a burning desire to visit 
the last frontier lands seen only by a lucky few in their youth 
proponents say the trips promote ambassadors for the earth 
critics complain of litter contact with remote tribes and 
disruption of breeding among protected wildlife 
theres clearly a trend toward these type of expeditionary 
visits to remote places in the world said bruce manheim an 
environmentalist seeking tourist controls of one of the hottest 
travel destinations antarctica 
travel agents and tour operators are targeting affluent and 
welltraveled americans with an urgent message go now before 
environmental destruction of earths final frontiers is complete 
if you dont go now you are going to miss it said new york 
travel agent chip snyder who specializes in customized tours 
he urges tourists to visit such places as brazil papua new 
guinea and indonesia 
james barnes an environmentalist for friends of the earth a 
washingtonbased lobbying group said adventure tourism has 
positive and negative consequences 
on the one hand its always useful to have intelligent and 
outwardly looking people to look at places in need of protection 
and it helps to provide a constituency for protection he said 
but the scale of these activities is growing at such a pace 
that it does provide cause for concern to a lot of environmental 
groups 
he pointed to the galapagos an equatorial island chain in the 
pacific 620 miles off south america 
scientists warn of unchecked tourism endangering the ecosystem 
there the desolate archipelago is invaded each year by thousands 
of tourists and the scientists say some are disobeying rules 
littering and disrupting wildlife 
ecuador which annexed the islands in 1832 has considered 
stemming the influx by imposing stiff tariffs on foreign visitors 
about 800 tourists visited the frozen continent of antarctica in 
1988 and nearly 3000 in 1989 with more than 4000 tourists 
expected in the upcoming decembertofebruary season 
this may be just the tip of the iceberg said manheim who 
has called for strict regulation of tourist activities near 
wildlife breeding sites and coordination of cruise ship visits to 
protected areas 
travel to the himalayas also has risen 
sir edmund hillary the 70yearold new zealand adventurer who 
pioneered the route up mount everest in 1953 complained last march 
of tourist development destroying the pristine innocence of the 
majestic mountains 
the living standards are increasing but the beautiful tracks 
and valleys have been littered he said 
in brazil tourism poses a different problem encroachment on 
the jungledwelling tribes barnes said but richard brill general 
manager of amazon explorers in parlin nj said not all visitors 
to that region are insensitive 
brill has been leading travelers to the amazon for three decades 
and said visitors come back committed to saving the rain forests 
he said tours show tourists its destruction firsthand 
i can show you scores of letters from people who have taken my 
voyages who have become involved right away with the earth 
brill said you should see the letters to the governments to 
protect the jungles and to protect the indians

ford motor co says it has no reason to 
investigate complaints of sudden acceleration of its aerostar 
minivans despite an accident that killed two people in illinois 
the center for auto safety a consumer watchdog group demanded 
a government probe friday in a letter to the national highway 
traffic safety administration a spokesman said the request was 
being studied 
the center has received nine reports that aerostars accelerate 
suddenly after the gear is shifted from the park position 
vehicle safety staffer douglas nelson said in the letter 
a 57yearold woman and a 17monthold child died last sunday 
after being hit by a 1990 aerostar at a church picnic in nokomis 
ill nelson said 
witnesses said the minivans engine began racing as soon as it 
was started the driver shifted to reverse but the vehicle lurched 
forward out of control nelson said 
ford has persistently claimed that events such as the one that 
occurred in nokomis are impossible he said adding that the 
government hasnt pressed for the hard answers 
nelson said the traffic agency should send a team of 
investigators to examine the van and should open a probe of all 
198690 aerostars rather than sweep these tragic sudden 
acceleration deaths under the rug as it has done so many times in 
the past 
ford spokeswoman anne doylefarrell said the government had 
concluded a study last year that found no evidence of a mechanical 
defect causing sudden acceleration in aerostars 
the company does not believe another probe is justified she 
said 
we had a team of engineers in nokomis yesterday cooperating 
with local authorities on inspecting the vehicle she said the 
vehicle passed just fine there was no mechanical problem at all 
with the vehicle that was related to the accident 
ford has no explanation for the cause of the tragedy ms 
doylefarrell said we certainly feel very sorry about what 
happened she said

an estrogen replacement drug taken by women 
who have had hysterectomies may also protect against heart disease 
a government committee says 
there is enough evidence to conclude the drug premarin lowered 
the risk of heart disease in postmenopausal women who have had 
their uteri and ovaries removed the food and drug administrations 
fertility and maternal health drugs advisory committee said friday 
but representatives of the national womens health network 
opposed the finding and issued a statement saying that greater use 
of premarin would be alarming until more is known about the 
longterm effects of the drug something the committee said should 
be studied 
the fda considers recommendations by advisory committees in 
establishing the approved uses for a drug once the agency has 
established any approved use physicians are free to prescribe the 
drug for any other use 
premarin manufactured by wyethayerst laboratories is an 
artificial form of estrogen it is now approved for treatment of 
menopause symptoms and to help in the prevention of osteoporosis a 
thinning of bones that often occurs among women after menopause 
nine members of the panel voted for the conclusion and a tenth 
member abstained according to fda spokeswoman susan cruzan 
the studies evaluated by the advisory committee suggested that 
the drug also reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by as much 
as 50 percent among postmenopausal women or among women who have 
had hysterectomies 
estrogen is one of the hormones that regulate development of the 
secondary sex characteristics the body produces it naturally 
during a womans childbearing years 
cruzan said the committee also concluded that the studies showed 
that the health benefits from the estrogen replacement drug 
outweigh the risk from side effects providing women taking the 
drug dont have other indications for caution such as smoking a 
family history of breast cancer or a personal history of gall 
bladder disease or a blood clotting disorder 
it is alarming to think that millions of women may be given 
this drug before either its dangers or benefits are understood 
said david birnbaum of the national womens health network 
premarin is designed to restore the hormone after age surgery 
or disease ends its natural production

the agriculture department has cleared the way 
for the first field trials in the united states of genetically 
engineered corn 
the permit clears the way for biotechnica agriculture inc of 
overland park kan to begin its tests this month in lisbon iowa 
the department said friday 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the tests will continue 
through the summer he said the companys procedures were designed 
carefully so as not to disturb the environment 
the corn being tested differs from standard seed only in that it 
contains genetic marker genes these will allow scientists to map 
more exactly the locations on chromosomes of genes that determine 
the corns characteristics including yield and resistance to 
diseases 
once the genes are located researchers can manipulate and 
eventually introduce them into new corn varieties and other crops 
as well 
biotechnica scientists already have examined the experimental 
corn plants in the greenhouse and want to repeat the studies under 
field conditions glosser said 
the corn project follows announcement earlier this week of 
similar field trials for soybeans and rice

the property agreement was the result of weeks of negotiations 
between the german governments it was outlined in a fourpage 
statement read at a news conference by rudolf seiters chief of 
staff for chancellor helmut kohl 
the agreement was part of overall accord on upcoming monetary 
and economic unification representatives from the west and east 
had been meeting to iron out that and other issues 
the statement said the rights of east german renters living in 
disputed apartments or on disputed property would be protected 
according to east german law 
for east germans who bought appropriated land or who own 
buildings which were erected on confiscated property a socially 
acceptable compensation was to be worked out either through 
exchange of property of similar value or other unspecified 
compensation it said 
the accord however does not apply to property confiscated 
during the 19451949 soviet postwar administration of the territory 
that later became east germany seiters said he said the soviets 
and east germans balked at that idea 
it was not immediately clear how much of the property in 
question was taken during the four years after the war and 
officials could not be reached for comment friday night 
seiters said it would be up to a future joint german parliament 
to make a final decision on any governmental compensation for 
property seized in the four years after the war 
the agreement for the return of private assets confiscated by 
the east german government applies to germans who fled east germany 
from 1949 on and will also extend to nationalized companies 
the statement said either the entire company would be returned 
to the original owner or some form of compensation would be made 
seiters said the east german government was working on a program 
to outline the time frame in which applications for return of 
property or compensation could be submitted and that experts from 
both countries would continue working out the details of the 
compensation program 
the east german government will establish a separate fund to 
take care of compensation payments he said 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann said the 
staatsvertrag or state treaty that won final committee approval 
late friday holds some some economic risks for east germany but 
there was no reason for exaggerated pessimism 
naturally after 40 years of planned economy there will be 
painful cuts of course some companies will have to close down 
haussmann said 
some experts have said up to 2 million east germans could lose 
their jobs as antiquated factories go bust and there is 
speculation that public unrest in east germany could follow

in a stern rejection of the communist 
party leadership coal miners from across the country have 
threatened a strike next month if the government of prime minister 
nikolai ryzhkov does not resign 
the miners closing a fiveday congress friday also demanded 
that the party relinquish control over the government and state 
enterprises and give up its vast inventory of property 
the miners earlier announced plans to create a new labor union 
independent of the party and the government 
the actions marked the first time a national organization with 
such massive support has challenged communist party authority so 
decisively 
bulat mukazhanov chairman of the first congress of soviet 
miners and a representative of miners from karaganda in kazakhstan 
said it was not clear how many of the nations 1 million coal 
miners would heed the strike call set for july 11 
it would be a political strike mukazhanov said 
the moves at the congress intensified the political crisis 
facing soviet president and communist party leader mikhail s 
gorbachev who is already dealing with secessionist republics 
ethnic violence and a crumbling economy 
gorbachev could be the first soviet leader since vladimir lenin 
to face an independent nationally organized labor union 
the miners did not directly challenge gorbachev and their 
position left him a way to steer the party toward more radical 
reform and force the resignation of ryzhkov who has been left to 
bear responsibility for unpopular economic policies 
the miners resolution called for the resignation of the 
government a reference to ryzhkov and his cabinet gorbachev 
is at the beginning of a fiveyear term but the prime minister can 
be replaced by parliament at any time 
political strikes were outlawed last year but the soviet 
government has been unable to enforce the ban economic strikes are 
legal only after a period of negotiations 
last summer about 500000 miners walked out in the soviet 
unions first nationwide strike paralyzing heavy industry and 
raising fears of whole cities freezing but the winter was warm 
angered by the governments failure to fulfill promises it made 
to end that strike the miners formed a committee to draft bylaws 
for a new union independent of the communist party and the 
government the union is to be founded at a second meeting 
scheduled for aug 1516 in moscow 
the current congress which included delegates from all 712 coal 
mines in the country suggested nationalizing the communist partys 
huge holdings which include buildings publishing houses and 
newspapers automobiles and bank accounts 
the communist party of the soviet union claims that it is the 
party of the working class its vanguard we are workers but we do 
not regard the party in its present form as our party read a 
resolution 
the resolution was passed by a vote of 308116 at the conclusion 
of the congress in donetsk the center of the largest soviet coal 
region 
we demand that the communist party be deprived immediately of 
its privileged position in our enterprises it said 
the miners said in a separate resolution that they supported a 
more rapid transition to a market economy than proposed by ryzhkov 
even though it might mean that some unprofitable mines would be 
closed and miners thrown out of work 
ryzhkovs plan presented to the supreme soviet legislature last 
month and defended by gorbachev on national television called for 
the price of bread to triple on july 1 and the price of most other 
food to double at the beginning of next year 
the legislature has delayed the unpopular bread increase for at 
least two months it has told the government to come back in the 
fall with more detailed plans for economic reform

ride somebodys tail on the highway in 
some states and they might take a pot shot at you in massachusetts 
they might draw swords 
a couple who apparently thought a bigrig truck was following 
too closely stopped the car and assaulted the truck driver with 
antique swords state trooper stephen earle said friday 
never a dull moment said earle of the wednesday altercation 
on route 3 in duxbury ive seen fistfights and of course you 
always hear about people pulling guns but this is the first time 
ive ever had anyone pull a sword 
no one was injured the truck driver used a long metal hook to 
defend himself earle said 
i tell you he was a little astounded earle said 
robert m nightingale 29 of quincy and edith kigsbury 24 of 
marshfield pleaded innocent thursday in plymouth district court to 
charges including assault and battery with a dangerous weapon 
nightingale apparently kept one sword in the cars back seat and 
one in the trunk earle said 
massachusetts law forbids nightingale from carrying a firearm 
because he is a convicted felon earle said 
this may have been his remedy to that situation earle said 
nightingale posted bail which was set at 2500 the woman was 
released without bail a pretrial hearing was scheduled for june

the blaze aboard the leaking mega borg 
has been extinguished and firefighters doused the sizzling 
supertanker today to avoid a flareup 
the fire was put out friday but coast guard and state officials 
warned that the norwegian ship crippled in an explosion june 8 
still posed a threat 
there are no flames however its still real hot and if we 
walk away from it right now it may reflash its not yet dead 
coast guard chief petty officer todd nelson said 
the accident left 43 million gallons of light african crude in 
the gulf of mexico the fifth worst spill in us history tar 
balls from a 10mile long slick were expected sunday on the bolivar 
peninsula about 40 miles east of galveston 
tar balls from the spill had been expected to hit shore friday 
but jerry galt of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration in houston said changing currents and atmospheric 
conditions delayed their arrival 
scientists on friday unleashed experimental oileating bacteria 
on a patch of the slick and awaited results of the procedure 
called bioremediation 
salvage crews today hoped to transfer oil remaining in a 
ruptured 55 million tank to an undamaged tank to stop a continuing 
leak and to balance the 886foot ship the supertanker was loaded 
with 38 million gallons of oil 
an official from det norske veritas norways equivalent to the 
american bureau of shipping was expected to board the mega borg to 
inspect damage over the weekend 
the ship with its rear section awash and seared by fiery 
explosions was clear of smoke for the first time friday 
i feel like i am face to face with my enemy said texas 
water commission chairman bj buck wynne looking at the 
listing hulk from a coast guard boat about 100 yards away 
for the first time since this thing began im beginning to 
believe we can beat it but i know there is going to be a next 
time wynne said 
more than two dozen boats were expected to continue skimming 
spilled oil today salvage crews said they have collected 146389 
gallons of oil the coast guard said friday most of the light crude 
that spilled either evaporated or burned and less than 22000 
gallons remained in the water 
carl oppenheimer a scientist who developed bioremediation and 
was eager to see it tested for the first time on oil in open seas 
joined officials unleashing trillions of oileating microbes on the 
rustcolored slick 
they sprayed the bacteria mixture on an acre of oil about three 
miles southeast of the mega borg 
the bacteria will break the oil down into harmless fatty acids 
that will be consumed by marine life said oppenheimer a 
university of texas microbiologist who has been working on the 
process for 15 years 
oppenheimer predicted the acre would be clear of oil in one or 
two days 
this is breakthrough technology texas land commissioner 
garry mauro said 
investigators have not determined the cause of the fire that 
killed two of the ships 41 crew members injured 17 and left two 
missing and presumed dead 
a panel convened by norwegian consul general erik leikvang 
concluded a threeday hearing friday 
at the hearing officials asked third mate jaipal singh mahlawat 
to elaborate on a fuel leak discovered in the ships pump room six 
hours before the explosion 
i saw the pump man he was screwing a coupling back to stop 
the oil from leaking mahlawat said no oil was leaking he had 
already wiped it out 
the pump man putham mahamood testified thursday through a 
translator that he performed no measurable repair work the day 
of the explosion 
the mega borgs chief engineer told the panel thursday one of 
the vessels pumps was leaking fuel about six hours before the 
explosion and a norwegian shipping inspector said some other pumps 
were overdue for an inspection 
coast guard investigator ruben arredondo who sat in on 
testimony but was not a member of the panel said the oil leak may 
have provided the fuel source for a fire sparked by something such 
as a bad light fixture 
the panel will send its report to the norwegian maritime 
investigative bureau which will determine if the ship is seaworthy 
and if there is any criminal liability

here are the key facts about bioremediation an experimental 
plan to dump oileating bacteria on the mega borg oil slick in the 
gulf of mexico off galveston texas 
description bioremediation uses naturally occurring bacteria 
microbes which have a sandlike consistency to reduce oil to an 
emulsion of fatty acids the emulsion sinks and is consumed by 
marine life microbes die when they cannot find any more oil to eat 
uses the microbes have been used for years to clean up 
hazardous waste sites treat sewage and wastewaters and extract 
oil from tight geologic formations they were used to clean some 
rocks on shore after the exxon valdez accident last year in alaska 
their use off texas was the first time bioremediation has been used 
in the water to clean up an oil spill 
plan state officials mixed the bacteria in 100gallon tanks of 
salt water and shot it through hoses from a coast guard cutter 
amount officials planned to use 100 pounds of the bacteria each 
day for three to four days on freshly spilled oil near the vessel 
cost the test will cost the state about 50000

cement blocks were all that remained of 
homes fallen branches stood where trees used to be and muddy 
streams meandered through the outskirts of this ohio river town 
after a furious flash flood 
residents donned shorts and hipwaders friday to begin putting 
their lives back together after 5 inches of rain fell in 3 hours 
late thursday churning floodwaters that left at least 11 people 
dead and 51 others missing early today 
the shock had not worn off said police officer bruce fink 
whose bristly face bore signs of more than 20 hours on duty 
including work at a temporary morgue set up at a funeral home 
we have counselors back there now but weve lost whole 
families its just been devastating he said friday night 
fink said he feared there wouldnt be enough funeral homes to 
handle the dead in this eastern ohio town of 4300 people 
allan hans called the flooding the devils work 
i lost everything but my car and the clothes im wearing he 
said 
hans said he was sitting in his trailer when he heard a branch 
crack and went to check out the noise he saw rushing water ran to 
tell neighbors and moved his car the trailer was swept away by the 
time he returned home 
john and sue wright whose home rests on the banks of pipe 
creek estimated they lost about 20000 worth of property 
i was one of the lucky ones what i lost i can replace 
wright said 
although it was the center of rescue operations downtown 
shadyside suffered no apparent flood damage but it was a different 
story on the outskirts of town in the heart of ohios richest coal 
fields 
cars were mired roofdeep in mud and guardrails and chunks of 
concrete were torn from roads 
a 20foot 18inch thick beam that held a sign leading to 3ks 
bar near pipe creek was twisted like a pretzel by the force of what 
witnesses described as a wall of water 
people moved rubble and made makeshift repairs to bridges that 
span mcmann creek which links homes to ohio route 147 many 
bridges were washed away 
small tractors and fourwheeldrive vehicles were the only means 
of transportation in much of the stricken area 
at least 170 members of the ohio national guard were called in 
to patrol and to help rebuild floodswept roads said stacie gilg 
a spokeswoman for the ohio emergency management agency 
disasters always bring out the curious and this was no 
exception by friday night traffic jammed ohio route 7 which 
skirts the ohio river and is the main northsouth road through town 
belmont county sheriff tom mccort said he suspected many of the 
vehicles belonged to sightseers 
mccort said there were no serious attempts at looting he said 
he was pleased with the assistance of young people 
one young man turned in a strongbox filled with valuable coins 
lost in the flood the sheriff said 
the kid handed me this box and it was unlocked mccort 
said it really made me feel good

dick tracy facing stiff competition this 
weekend at the box office got mostly rave reviews from critics 
the walt disney co production could generate boxoffice 
receipts of 30 million from its debut on about 2200 screens 
nationwide this weekend 
an entertainment industry analyst jeffrey logsdon of crowell 
weedon amp co said the film might bring in up to 7 million more 
from special early screenings starting at midnight thursday 
on friday disney stocks were up 275 to 13175 in trading on 
the new york stock exchange as doubts about the success of the 35 
million production faded 
there were some concerns that dick tracy would be a flop 
but its a commercially viable product logsdon said he said the 
stocks rise was due to the realization that disney continues to 
surprise its doubters 
critic vincent canby wrote in the new york times on friday that 
the film directed by and starring warren beatty is a great 
uninterrupted grin a movie that finds funniness in the most 
unexpected places and characters 
sheila benson of the los angeles times called it a film of 
enormous style with a sure sense of itself 
associated press critic bob thomas said the film is 
distinguished by its originality 
two of the few negative reviews of the film appeared in the wall 
street journal and the trade newspaper daily variety the film also 
stars madonna al pacino and dustin hoffman 
the films immediate competition will be gremlins 2 the new 
batch arnold schwarzeneggers total recall and eddie 
murphys another 48 hrs the original gremlins released in 
1984 produced worldwide revenues of 200 million 
almost a year ago warner bros opened batman to record 
business of 405 million in one weekend batman went on to 
gross more than 250 million domestically 
theres a big question as to how this weekend is going to 
come out said john krier president of exhibitor relations co

the government has decided to inject 85 million 
into britains foundering film industry in an effort to turn around 
seven years of hard times 
prime minister margaret thatcher told a meeting of film industry 
representatives friday that the money will be used over the next 
three years to help british filmmakers seeking coproductions 
elsewhere in europe 
theater attendance soared last year in britain but british film 
production reached its lowest level since 1981 britain made only 
25 films last year mrs thatcher said 
some production companies have gone bust the best known is 
goldcrest films which helped bring chariots of fire 
gandhi and the killing fields to the screen the 
independent companys work between 1977 and 1986 received dozens of 
awards including 19 oscars but it collapsed after a series of 
flops 
the lag followed a boom in the early 1980s when the industry 
seemed reborn when chariots scriptwriter colin welland 
accepted the 1982 academy award for best film he declared 
triumphantly the british are coming 
british films have not benefited from the government support 
given the industry in countries like australia and france 
the british film industry has a proud record of excellence 
but film production in this country has been on the decline mrs 
thatcher said this is an industry in which britain cannot just 
compete we can excel 
the meeting was attended by sir richard attenborough the 
director of gandhi and david puttnam who produced chariots 
of fire 
i am hugely encouraged puttnam said all we have asked 
for over a long period of time is a hearing and that is what we 
have had 
he called the 85 million a goodwill gesture 
what is more important over the long term is the formation of 
the working parties he said the committees are to look into 
setting up government incentives to attract private money 
mrs thatcher also said the industry will study taxes on film 
production and report back to the government 
in addition the government will provide an additional 263500 
to support the 1990 european film awards in glasgow scotland 
the film industry representatives said their main concern was 
the lack of british investment in its own film industry they said 
money was available from the united states but any profits go 
right back across the atlantic

the tobacco institute and a congressman are 
pressing the environmental protection agency to withdraw or revise 
a draft report that incorporates the finding that secondhand 
tobacco smoke causes 32000 heart disease deaths among nonsmokers 
the finding has been incorporated into an epa technical 
compendium of the latest research on passive smoking sometimes 
referred to as environmental tobacco smoke or ets 
the report has not yet been released documents with information 
on its contents were obtained by the associated press from the 
tobacco institute and from the office of rep thomas bliley of 
richmond va 
it would in my judgment be most inappropriate to include 
this paper in its present form in the epa ets compendium of 
technical information wrote w gary flamm a tobacco institue 
consultant in summarizing the sixinch high stack of comments that 
the tobacco institute sent to the epa 
the chapter was written by stanton glantz and william parmley 
both professors in the department of medicine at the university of 
california san francisco parmley is a past president of the 
american college of cardiology 
elissa feldman in the epas indoor air division said the 
technical compendium is still undergoing revision and that it 
probably would not be released until later this summer 
glantz presented many of the chapters findings on may 21 at a 
scientific conference in boston but he did not disclose that they 
were included in the epas passive smoking report 
robert axelrad director of the epas indoor air division said 
glantz had been given permission to discuss his findings as long as 
he did not mention his connection with the epa 
he noted that the technical compendium was not a determination 
by the epa of the risks associated with passive smoking but a 
collection of stateoftheart summaries of research on passive 
smoking 
it will contain disclaimers that the views of the individual 
authors do not represent the views of the epa he said 
the link between the epa document and glantzs presentation in 
boston came in a june 6 letter to epa administrator william reilly 
in which bliley said that glantzs presentation in boston was based 
on the epa report 
bliley has had a long interest in tobacco issues philip morris 
is the largest private employer in his congressional district 
the chapter concludes that passive smoking causes 32000 heart 
disease deaths each year and a total of 50000 deaths each year 
when heart disease and cancers are combined 
that makes passive smoking the third leading cause of 
preventable death behind smoking and alcohol the report concludes 
the study based on a review of existing scientific studies 
also concludes that passive smoking increases a nonsmokers chance 
of dying from heart disease by 20 percent to 30 percent 
glantz said he could not discuss the details of the criticisms 
from the tobacco institute and bliley until the epa report is 
released 
he did make several general comments however all of the 
people who have reviewed this material both within the epa and as 
it was submitted to the scientific peer review process have been 
favorable except the tobacco institute he said 
the comments from the tobacco institute and blileys letter both 
include a strongly worded personal attack on glantz using similar 
language they accused him of being an antismoking advocate whose 
political activity compromises the integrity of his scientific work 
the fact that theyre conducting an adhominem attack on me 
shows that they cant find anything wrong with our work glantz 
said

jack henry abbott whose prison writings became 
a bestselling book lost a nearly 76 million court judgment to 
the widow of an aspiring actor he killed 
a jury awarded the money friday to ricci adan whose 22yearold 
husband richard was stabbed in the heart outside a manhattan 
restaurant where he worked as a waiter in 1981 
abbott whose writings were brought to public attention by 
norman mailer is serving a 15yeartolife sentence for 
firstdegree manslaughter in the slaying 
mrs adan 32 and her family sat quietly as the court clerk 
polled the jury at abbotts request leaving the courtroom they 
whooped shouted and hugged in celebration of the verdict after a 
twoweek civil trial on mrs adans wrongful death lawsuit against 
abbott 
abbott who acted as his own attorney said to the judge this 
is a little excessive your honor wouldnt you say 
the judge carol arber advised abbott he could appeal but he 
did not say whether he would 
its been a nightmare said mrs adan who had to be 
crossexamined by her husbands killer she said of her slain 
husband hes not just a speck of dust anymore hes not just a 
victim or a piece of paper hes a human being and he can rest 
now 
adan died july 18 1981 just six weeks after abbott paroled on 
earlier convictions 
naomi zack the state university of new york philosophy 
instructor abbott married last september while in prison was not 
in court for the verdict she had been present almost every day at 
the trial and was the only witness abbott called 
abbott tried to convince the jury that adan endured no pain and 
suffering because the single knife thrust through the heart killed 
him instantly

in a savage and atrocious murder the killer tries to 
inflict maximum damage on his victim abbott said 
mrs adan was in tears at abbotts descriptions of the killing 
abbott 46 sneered at a pace university economists projections 
that adan might have earned 17 million as a successful actor by 
the time he was 65 abbott said the calculation assumed adan 
would have been a movie star of the caliber of paul newman 
abbott gained fame from writing in the belly of the beast a 
bestseller composed of letters he wrote to mailer from prison 
between 1978 and 1981 
during those years abbott was behind bars first for bank

secretary of state james a baker iii met 
with his japanese counterpart and said afterward it will take a 
strong effort from both countries to reach a final trade 
agreement by the end of the month 
the united states and japan are rushing to draw up a final 
agreement aimed at correcting a trade imbalance between the 
countries in time for next months sevennation economic summit in 
houston 
our two nations the two largest economies in the world have 
an obligation to offer constructive international leadership 
baker said in a statement after the 3hour meeting at the fairmont 
hotel we believe we can do so as global partners 
foreign minister tara nakayama told baker that japan was 
making efforts to correct the trade imbalance between the 
nations a japanese government spokesman told reporters 
less than two weeks remain before japan and the united states 
are scheduled to wrap up trade talks and draw up a formal list of 
economic reforms fridays discussion reportedly was called so the 
officials could attempt to revive the talks which have become 
stalled in recent months 
nakayama made it clear that the japanese government is making 
efforts to reduce its current trade surplus makoto yamanaka a 
spokesman for the japanese foreign minister told reporters 
yamanaka stopped short of saying that fridays discussion had 
revived the stalled talks known as the structural impediment 
initiative saying only that progress was important to both 
governments 
the spokesman declined to discuss the specifics of the meeting 
of baker and nakayama but he said the two talked about eastern 
europe china and mongolia as well as the trade imbalance 
baker said it would take a good strong effort on both sides 
to come up with a final agreement 
one point of contention is that the bush administration has 
called for japan to spend at least 9 percent of its gross national 
product on government construction projects yamanaka said the 
foreign minister still had some resistance to a specific spending 
requirement 
the united states trade deficit with japan is 49 billion a 
year 
in april the two countries tentatively outlined a series of 
economic reforms japan agreed to open its retailing system 
increase spending on public works projects strengthen antitrust 
legislation and loosen restrictions on foreign investment 
the united states pledged to cut its federal budget deficit and 
take measures to increase savings and investment 
the sii talks begun last year have been bogged down lately 
with japan indicating its made all the concessions it can 
meanwhile the united states is characterizing the april accord as 
a way station with more concrete language needed to carry out 
the promises 
congressional critics have said the bush administrations 
decision to remove japan from a tough section of trade law called 
super 301 which threatens economic sanctions has allowed japan to 
refuse further concessions 
negotiators are supposed to conclude the talks june 2526 in 
tokyo

a county sheriff used the luck of the 
draw to determine which of two laidoff deputy sheriffs to rehire 
rc godsey won the draw on friday and returns to work july 1 
fayette county sheriff bill laird said 
a secretary shook up a box containing the names of godsey and 
garland burke laird said he drew godseys name

state law provided no other guidance on how to decide 
burke had no comment the registerherald in beckley said 
godsey and burke were laid off jan 1 1989 because of budget 
cuts 
i just wish that both of us could have come back godsey

the second floor at bloomingdales featured a stack of eight 
televisions running the movies trailer nonstop in another section 
of the dick tracy shop there costar madonna belted out vogue

this is all for that movie asked one woman as she handed 
over 28 for a pair of tshirts the tracy togs were so prevalent 
that they displaced bart simpson and family from the top of the 
tshirt racks 
its great my wife says theyre quite well made not 
trashy said roger dutton a melbourne australia resident who 
was clutching a pair of towels you pay premium for the premium 
goods i guess

by breathless mahoney madonna drew plenty of interest but not as 
many buyers

said linda dechert who was visiting from indiana i think this 
stuff will catch on with the younger crowd madonnas so popular

quite that far said elaine johnson of la glo which is

a senior chinese official says two days 
of talks in hanoi failed to narrow differences between china and 
vietnam over how to end the 11yearold cambodian war 
deputy foreign minister xu dunxin headed the first highlevel 
chinese delegation to visit vietnam since the two countries fought 
a border war in 1979 the conflict came a few weeks after vietnam 
invaded cambodia and ousted the khmer rouge from power 
xu and vietnamese deputy foreign minister tran quang co held 
discussions in hanoi on tuesday and wednesday 
xu spoke friday in bangkok his comments were reported by the 
official chinese news agency xinhua 
he was quoted as saying the two countries remain divided over 
two key points the status of cambodias government during the 
transition period before a new administration and the status of 
its army during that period 
china is the principal backer of three cambodian guerrilla 
factions including the khmer rouge fighting the 
vietnameseinstalled government in phnom penh 
there have been proposals that the united nations become 
involved in adminstering the country to prepare the way for 
elections once the warring factions have agreed to a ceasefire 
but xinhua quoted xu as saying we came to know through the 
exchange of views that vietnam does not agree to bringing into full 
play the role of the united nations 
he said the vietnamese did not agree to an interim un 
trusteeship for cambodia or even to stationing a un peacekeeping 
force there 
xu said there are no plans for further talks the hanoi 
discussions were the fourth round of sinovietnamese talks over the 
past year and a half 
vietnam has sought to improve ties with china as the soviet 
union cuts back its economic and political support for hanoi and 
eastern european countries drift toward the west 
official radio hanoi on thursday gave only a brief and vague 
report on the talks indicating little progress was made 
the latest efforts to end the fighting in cambodia were set back 
earlier this month when the khmer rouge the strongest guerrilla 
faction refused to sign a ceasefire pact in tokyo saying it was 
denied equal representation in the negotiations china also refused 
to support the agreement

48state peace tour 
retired air force col frank martineau 69 of bethesda md 
and marjorie zeuch 67 of warwick ri died friday when their 
singleengine plane crashed short of an airport runway said maj 
robert wolfe of the air national guard in charleston 
the two also were trying to set a speed record for flying a 
singleengine plane to all capitals in the contiguous 48 states 
charleston was their nexttolast stop before winding up the trip 
later friday at washington national airport in virginia 
he had fuel on board and the landing gear was down said 
frank gurish a federal aviation administration investigator at the 
scene it would appear he was of the notion he was on a normal 
landing pattern it was on course it was just lower than he should 
have been 
the fourseat plane clipped a tree in a park about onehalf mile 
short of the yeager airport runway wolfe said the plane spun 
around and landed on its nose with the right wing torn off in 
several pieces said sgt vic gazitano of the kanawha county 
sheriffs department 
despite light rain visibility was 1 mile and the weather was 
good enough to permit landings said jack depew manager of the 
airport control tower 
zeuch was an english professor at rhode island community 
college martineau had been a pilot in the royal canadian air force 
and the us army air force during world war ii 
the 4000mile trip dubbed operation appleseed was taken 
to promote zeuchs world friendship association said chuck 
davenport managing editor of association trends a national weekly 
newspaper founded by martineau

dedicated to bringing ordinary people of the world closer 
together for permanent peace davenport said

a kidnapped american whose family raised 
60000 ransom in a public appeal was seized in south america after 
his boss at a gold mine refused to pay blackmail to a former 
employee a television station reported 
citing legal documents filed in a court in quito ecuador 
whoitv in peoria reported friday that scott heimdals kidnapping 
apparently was not a random terrorist act as previously thought 
in the documents heimdals boss jeffrey fino general manager 
of iminco gold mine in quito said a former employee had tried to 
blackmail him and orchestrated heimdals kidnapping 
fino claimed the worker was running guns to colombian terrorists 
as well whoi reported 
the former employee allegedly contacted fino in february to tell 
him a terrorist group wanted to kidnap and kill him but fino 
ignored the warning the station reported 
whoi also said the former employee made several attempts through 
blackmail to get fino to pay 40000 which fino rejected 
heimdal 27 formerly of peoria was kidnapped april 28 when a 
band of armed men attacked a canoe he was aboard killed the pilot 
and took heimdal and an ecuadoran hostage 
the attackers earlier believed to be colombian guerrillas 
freed the ecuadoran and sent him to quito with the ransom demand 
according to finos documents the former employee knew heimdal 
was a key worker on imincos small mining team and his loss would 
shut down the mine forcing fino to pay the ransom demands 
originally as high as 15 million and now 612000 
the tv station reported that an ecudoran judge will consider 
issuing a warrant for the former employees arrest monday 
finos home telephone number was unavailable and courts in 
ecuador were closed for the weekend 
it does make some sense said finos mother marie fino in 
a telephone interview from her home in warren pa jeff did tell 
us he had a problem with a former employee close to a year ago 
the fellow raided the mining camp and took some equipment when 
he left but i didnt know jeff was being threatened or 
blackmailed mrs fino told the associated press 
contacted by telephone late friday heimdals father roy 
heimdal said he was unaware of the latest development 
it was understood by most people that mr fino was the target 
of the kidnappers and they got scott by mistake that was our 
belief from the onset but we never heard anything like this 
before i dont know what to think roy heimdal said 
with the help of friends and business leaders in peoria the 
heimdals raised 60000 in four days only to learn wednesday the 
kidnappers wanted a total 612000 to release heimdal the 60000 
was simply to keep him alive the heimdals were told 
an undisclosed deadline was set for later this month for the 
payments balance

the government has rejected a vatican 
proposal aimed at breaking the deadlock in implementing a peace 
plan to end the 15yearold civil war newspapers said today 
the vatican had suggested amending the arab league peace plan to 
make it more acceptable to rebel christian gen michel aoun who 
has refused to recognize president elias hrawis authority the 
newspapers said 
but beiruts independent annahar daily said the vatican 
proposal was rejected by hrawi a maronite catholic and by prime 
minister salim hoss a sunni moslem and parliament speaker hussein 
husseini a shiite moslem 
also today police said aouns mainly christian troops and the 
rival lebanese forces militia led by christian warlord samir geagea 
skirmished during the night with machine guns and rocketpropelled 
grenades in east beirut 
no casualties were reported and the fighting died down at dawn 
police said 
it was the latest violation of an increasingly fragile monthold 
ceasefire mediated by the vatican to halt the fighting between 
aoun and geagea who are locked in a power struggle for control of 
the christian enclave north of beirut 
by police count 1036 people have been killed and 2774 wounded 
since the aoungeagea fighting erupted jan30 their battles have 
forced 40 percent of the enclaves 1 million population to flee to 
safer areas or leave the country 
annahar and the leftist beirut daily assafir said the 
vatican initiative was relayed to hrawis government in moslem west 
beirut by papal nuncio pablo puente earlier this week 
the reports said the vatican had proposed amending the arab 
league peace plan in return for aouns recognizing the hrawi 
governments authority 
the peace plan was endorsed last october by lebanons parliament 
at the saudi arabian resort of taif it calls for the equal 
distribution of power between the traditionally dominant christians 
and the majority moslems 
hrawi was elected nov 24 with syrian backing to implement the 
pact aimed at ending the bloody manysided civil war in which an 
estimated 150000 people have been killed over the past 15 years 
aoun a maronite catholic rejected the peace plan because it 
did not contain ironclad guarantees for the withdrawal of 40000 
syrian troops from lebanon the syrian troops were deployed under a 
1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate but aoun considers them an 
occupying army 
aoun also has refused to allow the hrawi government to extend 
its authority to areas under his control in the christian enclave 
hrawi in turn sacked aoun as army commander and interim premier

president violeta barrios de chamorro 
has announced plans to reduce the nicaraguan army the largest 
force in central america by half and retire some senior officers 
mrs chamorro who took over after the leftist sandinistas were 
defeated in free elections said on friday that the cutbacks would 
take effect by aug 3 
her spokesman antonio lacayo said the cuts would come mainly 
from sending draftees home and reducing the ranks of the militia 
he said the reductions would also affect activeduty troops and 
reserve forces 
mrs chamorro did not say whether the sandinista army chief 
gen humberto ortega would be among those senior officers who 
retire under the reforms she had said earlier that ortega brother 
of former sandinista president daniel ortega would hold the post 
only temporarily 
ortega told reporters later that the army itself will decide 
which officers stay and which leave 
mrs chamorro also said she was ordering the army and the 
interior ministry to disarm civilians 
it is my purpose that by christmas there are no weapons in the 
hands of anyone unless they are part of the nations army mrs 
chamorro said she said draftees would be home by dec 7 
the presidents announcement came in a speech to the cabinet 
representatives of the united nations and the organization of 
american states the diplomatic corps and the army general staff 
during the 10 years of sandinista rule nicaragua never made 
public the size of the army but estimates put its strength at near 
55000 making it the largest in central america 
gen ortega said on friday that the army numbered 96000 but it 
was not clear how many of those were activeduty troops and how 
many were reservists 
lacayo said the army numbered 80000 including reserves 
militia and draftees when mrs chamorro took office in april 
the president said the cutbacks would bring the army strength to 
less than 41000 men and women adding this means half of 
the members that it had on april 25 the day i assumed the 
presidency of the republic 
mrs chamorro also announced that 14200 of the usbacked 
contra rebels have demobilized so far the contras waged a nearly 
decadelong insurgency against the sandinistas 
with all security we can say that today the war has been left 
behind mrs chamorro said about 1000 contras have yet to 
demobilize but are expected to do so she said 
the measures were announced before mrs chamorro left for a 
regional weekend summit in guatemala also to be attended by 
secretary of state james a baker iii it will be mrs chamorros 
first summit as president 
mrs chamorro later arrived in guatemala the summit which is 
taking place in the town of antigua 30 miles west of guatemala 
city is expected to concentrate on efforts to reconstruct the

east german authorities have captured a 
reputed leftist terrorist linked to the 1985 bombing of a us air 
base in west germany and the deaths of three americans officials 
said today 
sigrid sternebeck 40 is the seventh alleged member of the 
notorious red army faction to be captured in east germany in the 
last 10 days 
the string of arrests is the result of a recent push by 
officials in both german states to locate longsought terrorist 
suspects who received sanctuary under east germanys former 
communist regime

authorities through the government news agency adn and confirmed 
by west german federal police spokesman hansjuergen foerster

foerster said west germany would seek the extradition of ms 
sternebeck who is charged in a warrant with murder and attempted 
murder he said she had been a member of the terrorist group since 
1977 
pimental was killed so terrorists could obtain his identity card 
and gain entry by car to the us air base at frankfurt west 
germany foerster said 
the car was rigged with explosives and detonated near the 
headquarters of the base where it killed two americans and injured 
20

bombings in west germany during the 1970s and 1980s their targets 
included top bankers and industrialists and military facilities and 
personnel

numerous other terrorist crimes 
the first of the seven suspects arrested susanne albrecht told 
police she was furnished with a false identity by the former secret 
police of the communist government 
the west german news magazine der spiegel meanwhile said one 
of the suspects seckendorffgudent had served on a local council 
set up to help with east germanys transition to democracy

hardline government of erich honecker was ousted by mass 
demonstrations in october the councils included intellectuals and 
prodemocracy activists 
der spiegel reported that seckendorffgudent who had been a 
physician in west germany and held the title of baron served as a

the citys streets were calm for the 
first time in four days today after miners went home at the behest 
of presidentelect ion iliescu who thanked them with all my 
heart for helping put down unrest 
iliescu also told the miners he was planning to establish a 
national guard to protect the government he said it would be 
composed of clean loyal honest people who can act resolutely 
at exceptional times 
the state news agency rompres said six people were killed and 
502 injured in the violence on wednesday thursday and friday the 
worst in romania since the uprising that toppled communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu in december 
at least 110 people were still hospitalized seven of them with 
very serious injuries rompres quoted health ministry officials as 
saying 
the agency quoted railway official ion tica as saying the last 
train of miners left bucharest late friday night for western 
romania 
the center of the city was quiet as a steady rain poured today 
helmeted police armed with automatic weapons encircled the square 
to prevent new protests and police reinforcements sat in several 
trucks nearby 
rows of tanks and tight clusters of soldiers guarded government 
headquarters and the state tv station which came under fierce 
attacks on wednesday night by antigovernment demonstrators 
no miners were visible this morning but on friday evening one 
miner said small contingents from each mine would remain in the 
capital in case of renewed trouble he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
although isolated groups of miners roamed city streets late 
friday they appeared to have abandoned earlier tactics of beating 
anybody they considered opponents of the government 
armed with clubs iron bars and cudgels they had swarmed into 
bucharest early thursday to defend iliescu who appealed for help 
when demonstrators who demanded that all excommunists be banned 
from government besieged the interior ministry and burned down 
police headquarters 
western governments condemned the violence 
us state department spokesman richard boucher said friday that 
all but humanitarian aid would be withheld and the european 
community postponed a trade and economic agreement with romania 
premier petre roman told a news conference the miners had been 
asked only to restore order on university square the center of a 
53day antigovernment demonstration that riot police ended 
wednesday by firing on demonstrators 
roman said his government deplored all the subsequent violence 
he also promised negotiations with striking students and 
professors at two bucharest university faculties the youth daily 
tineretul liber reported the faculties of physics and architecture 
were on strike to protest the brutal attack by proiliescu workers 
thursday 
iliescu appeared on state tv friday night to thank with all my 
heart the miners who came to defend his government against what 
he termed a fascist rebellion 
he then told them to return home to western romania the 
countrys mining region where iliescu and his national salvation 
front have a strong power base iliescu won their loyalty by giving 
them pay riss and improved working conditions soon after taking 
power 
he also told them he was forming a national guard to protect 
romania from rightwing extremists whom he charged were aided from 
abroad 
we are dealing here with a broader scenario of european 
proportions said iliescu quoted by bbc monitors from romanian 
radio there was a joint action of rightwing forces which 
started from the presumption that rightwing forces in all east 
european countries could come to power 
iliescu and the front won free elections may 20 by a landslide 
but the opposition distrusts him and other former communists from 
the ceausescu era they want them prohibited by law from holding 
public office for 10 years

soviet authorities began pumping natural gas to a 
fertilizer plant in lithuania today easing the blockade on fuel 
supplies to the breakaway baltic republic 
in neighboring latvia leaders of proindependence fronts from 
all three baltic republics gathered at a resort near the capital 
riga to discuss the future of their secessionist movements 
officials in latvia and lithuania also met separately to discuss 
compromises offered by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in an 
effort to get talks started between the republics and the kremlin 
the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia were 
annexed by the soviet union 50 years ago they have all been 
seeking more autonomy but lithuania has been the only one of the 
three to declare independence 
a spokesman for the lithuanian parliament aidas palubinskas 
said he was told today by a pipeline dispatcher that natural gas 
was again flowing from the soviet union to the azotas fertilizer 
plant in the city of jonova 
the move fulfilled a promise made to lithuanian prime minister 
kazimiera prunskiene on wednesday by soviet prime minister nikolai 
ryzhkov that 15 percent of the republics daily natural gas supply 
would be restored 
politburo member yuri d maslyukov told a news conference in 
moscow on friday that the restoration of fuel to the lithuanian 
plant was a goodwill gesture from the kremlin and a reiteration 
of the soviet governments interest in speeding negotiations 
more than 26000 people have been thrown out of work in 
lithuania due to the kremlins blockade of all oil most natural 
gas and some raw materials 
gorbachev imposed the embargo after the republic refused to 
rescind its march 11 declaration of independence 
palubinskas said that restoration of gas supplies to the azotas 
plant would mean that 1600 laidoff workers out of a staff of 
4500 should be back at work by the end of next week 
at the beachfront resort of jurmala in latvia leaders of the 
popular fronts of latvia and estonia and the sajudis movement of 
lithuania opened the second baltic assembly 
the participants are assessing their movements role in 
conditions where the fronts representatives won a majority in 
republic parliaments and local councils the soviet news agency 
tass said 
tass said the delegates 50 from each of the proindependence 
movements also discussed cooperation between the baltics and other 
soviet republics 
speakers at the oneday assembly concluded that prospects for 
achieving full independence have grown dramatically over the past 
year they cited the introduction of democratic governments in 
eastern europe and the reshaping of the warsaw pact into a 
political alliance said journalist alexander sidyachko who 
attended the meeting 
he said they adopted a resolution calling on the 35 signatory 
nations of the helsinki accords to hold a conference on the baltic 
drive for independence 
the first baltic assembly was held in the estonian capital 
tallinn in may of last year 
in lithuania mrs prunskiene and her top ministers discussed a 
proposal by gorbachev who offered to open talks if implementation 
of the republics independence declaration was frozen the 
unofficial interfax news agency said 
the proposal will be discussed by a full session of the supreme 
council next week lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis was 
reported as saying at the baltic assembly 
latvian ministers also discussed proposals by gorbachev aimed at 
leading toward negotiation on their calls for independence 
the latvian leadership concluded that gorbachev was not specific 
enough in his compromise offer sidyachko said by telephone from 
riga however he quoted legislator andrei pantaleyev as saying an 
official response to gorbachev could only be issued by a full 
meeting of the republics supreme council

the political landscape that marion barry 
helped to shape in this city is guaranteed to change as a result of 
his decision not to seek a fourth term as mayor 
barrys decision announced at the start of his trial on drug 
and perjury charges closes a chapter that began two decades 
earlier 
barry worked hard to gain voting rights for residents of the 
nations capital and was rewarded with election twice to the school 
board and once to the city council before winning the mayors chair 
in 1978 
barry was considered one of the most promising black politicians 
in the country a veteran of the civil rights movement he was 
working to extend benefits beyond voting rights to those who 
elected him 
throughout his three terms his administration has been known 
for providing services and opportunities to those he described in 
his withdrawal speech as the locked out the shut out 
he was by and large the start of elected politics for 
residents of the district of columbia said local political 
analyst mark plotkin a commentator with wamufm 
but after the mayor publicly abandoned his reelection hopes 
last week attention focused on what will become of barry and how 
far he has fallen 
the mayor has told aides privately that he would consider 
running a city agency for the four years he needs to complete 20 
years of government service and qualify for a hefty pension his 
name has also been floated as a possible president for the cityrun 
university of the district of columbia 
but in recent weeks the mayor has been concentrating more on 
the immediate future his trial 
whoever is the next mayor hell be talking to them then 
said one aide he still has some influence and there are a lot 
of things he can do 
there has also been talk of drafting a city council resolution 
that would exempt barry from the last four years he needs for his 
pension and jesse jackson and other ministers have announced that 
they would establish a fund to ensure barrys financial wellbeing 
on the political front barrys withdrawal from the race removes 
a long shadow that had settled over the other five candidates 
ive been campaigning 17 hours a day since long before marion 
got in trouble city council chairman david clarke told reporters 
thursday while he distributed leaflets at a subway stop the only 
difference today is all the reporters 
most observers say that atlarge city council member john rays 
campaign is likely to get the biggest boost from barrys departure 
ray is viewed as somebody who hasnt beaten up on the mayor 
someone who is also black someone who is considered the 
alternative said plotkin no one is going to get the lions 
share of barrys voters but ray will get his portion which will 
cushion his current total 
a washington post poll conducted in may showed that with barry 
in the race the mayor and ray led the field each with 23 percent 
of the vote the poll showed that rays support would climb to 29 
percent if barry stayed out of the september primary 
barrys decision to drop out only intensifies the jockeying that 
began soon after he was arrested in an fbi sting last january 
in march civil rights veteran walter e fauntroy announced that 
he was giving up his nonvoting house seat after 19 years to run for 
mayor that touched off a scramble for fauntroys job with civil 
rights attorney eleanor holmes norton and city council member betty 
ann kane now leading a crowded field of five candidates 
still others are now vying for the seats of council members who 
have jumped into the mayors race 
many of them were in the race already but barrys problems 
guarantee political change here plotkin said things will be 
quite different now thats undeniable

erich mielke ran his secret empire from a 
musty dimly lighted office in a huge complex of buildings on the 
outskirts of east berlin 
when he was forced to give up his post as chief of the east 
german secret police he left behind an empty safe a new paper 
shredder and a poorly rendered painting of the berlin wall 
he left an open jar of fruit juice in the refigerator a box of 
uniforms from the communist youth group in a closet and a personal 
switchboard where he could reach his security chiefs anywhere in 
the world 
as almost every east german knows mielke also left behind a 
vast army of secret police and 6 million clandestine files a 
seemingly bottomless well of information ranging from the mundane 
to the potentially explosive 
the secret security police organization no longer exists 
mielke 82 is hospitalized and reportedly suffering from senility 
the new government is trying to decide what to do with the 
employees the buildings and the millions of files 
to many east germans the files are a pandoras box of paranoia 
that can both ruin lives or expose collaborators of the old regime 
to western intelligence agencies they are a potential gold mine 
of information about the former governments espionage activities 
abroad and its reputed role in training or harboring international 
terrorists 
they are very important said george carver a former cia 
station chief in bonn west germany the east germans ran a very 
efficient police state and had one of the best intelligence 
services in the world he said in a recent telephone interview 
east german authorities in the past two weeks arrested several 
reputed members of west germanys leftist red army faction which 
has been blamed for a string of killings and bombings during the 
past two decades 
all had been among the most wanted people in west german 
history and all had been living quietly in east germany apparently 
with the knowledge and help of the former secret police 
one susanne albrecht said she had been granted asylum by the 
secret police and furnished with a new identity 
another inge viett 46 was known to be living in east germany 
as far back as 1986 
the east germans were used to train security services around 
the world said carver they were very involved in allowing 
terrorists to stay in east germany if that is with foundation it 
should be made public 
interior minister petermichael diestel of east germany who 
oversees police functions in east germany said he would clear up 
as much as possible this diabolical connection between the ministry 
for state security and the terror scene 
but diestel has come under fire for employing more than 2000 
members of the former secret police known as the stasi 
stasi employees still work at the vast main headquarters in 
berlin and many are in the police department 
they are still around and i do not know why i see the same 
people drinking in the same bars said east berliner helmut 
frankan 66 who said his restaurant was closed by the secret 
police because too many young people frequented it 
thousands of others are unemployed and drawing jobless benefits 
or pensions 
many former east german agents were believed to have been 
recruited both by soviet and western intelligence agencies after 
the prodemocracy revolt 
hans gert lange a spokesman for west german 
counterintelligence agency said there was a sharp rise in 
defections from east germany after the old hardline regime was 
thrown out last autumn a lot i would say he said 
about 85000 people were employed by the stasi from file clerks 
to surveillance experts and another 109000 ranging from 
teachers to travel agents had informal secret police duties 
hotels that catered to foreign visitors were known to be havens 
for stasi agents who worked behind counters and carried luggage 
after the former government of hardliner erich honecker was 
toppled last autumn a caretaker communist government appointed a 
committee and a team of government officials to disband the stasi 
and catalog the files and its vast properties 
after the current government was elected that committee was 
replaced by a new one that is to recommend to the government how to 
finally dismantle the oncefearsome apparatus and perhaps most 
importantly what to do with the closely guarded files 
several members of parliament have been accused of working for 
the secret police and two prominent politicians resigned earlier 
this year amid the allegations 
prime minister lothar de maiziere has denied similiar 
accusations that he was a secret police informant 
albrecht dauer a former member of the citizens committee said 
virtually all 400 parliament members have looked at their stasi 
files 
many east germans have intense hatred for the sprawling network 
that followed bugged intimidated interrogated and often 
imprisoned dissidents 
a stasi file from last year on an east german environmental 
group includes detailed lists of meetings members and even the 
name of the pastor of the church where it met 
it refers to the groups hostile and negative activities 
excia man carver said east germany should conduct a 
casebycase analysis of the stasi files and remove any elected 
official who was found to have collaborated 
eberhard schultz a foreign policy specialist for the german 
society for foreign politics a bonnbased think tank said it 
would be dangerous to rely on the files 
a file may indicate a person was targeted for recruitment as an 
informer but never say if that person refused he said 
his reputation would be ruined if it becomes public he said 
schultz said virtually everyone at east german universities who 
had the freedom to travel abroad was expected to report back to the 
stasi on the contacts they made 
do you fire all the teachers he said

more than 1 million divorced and widowed 
fathers are on the daddy track learning to balance children 
housework social life and career as a single parent 
their numbers are growing and are expected to continue rising as 
more fathers seek custody and courts become more inclined to go 
along 
like single mothers these men are discovering there are 
pitfalls in raising kids alone but their problems often are 
different 
single fathers usually are better off financially than single 
mothers on the other hand people tend to treat men differently 
than their female counterparts 
from the sales clerk to the nextdoor neighbor people often 
react by heaping assistance on these singleparent fathers 
offering help with child care cooking cleaning and shopping says 
geoffrey l greif an associate professor at the university of 
marylands baltimore school of social work 
the result greif says is that many of these fathers get 
conflicting messages 
they are praised for what they are doing but on the other 
hand they are offered a helping hand he said in an interview 
last week people think they are incompetent to do it by 
themselves its a funny position that these men are put in being 
praised and insulted 
psychologically the adjustments are different also 
when men gain custody they often feel like freaks like there 
arent any other people out there doing it greif said 
greif who profiles single fathers in a new book said a father 
once asked him how many other freaks are there like me 
the impression is that they are doing something that is 
strange and some men interpret that to mean they are doing 
something that isnt masculine and that takes a toll thats harder 
to measure and harder to see 
it tends to isolate some of the fathers and in a society 
that believes women should be the ones raising children it has the 
potential for hindering the selfesteem of the children he said 
using a survey of more than 1100 single fathers with custody 
and interviews with dozens of others greif crafted a profile of 
these men for his book the daddy track and the single parent 
the book debunks many of the myths of single fathering 
including popular notions of men foundering in the kitchen and 
chaotically coping with the daily chores 
in fact one of the biggest trouble areas for single fathers 
like single mothers is balancing work and child rearing 
greif said some of the fathers he interviewed had to quit their 
jobs and some were fired but most often the problem was a 
frustrating halt to their rise up the career ladder 
men in our society define themselves as males based in large 
part on their success at work so when you place a man on this 
track he sometimes has to make a choice between pursuing his 
career path or putting his career on hold greif said 
singleparenting often limits an employees ability to travel on 
short notice which can hinder their chances for promotion some 
men feel they are being passed over he said 
housekeeping and child care are easier problems to overcome 
greif found after the first few months on their own most men had 
these areas under control and generally their relationships with 
their children were positive he said 
in 1988 about 12 million divorced and widowed fathers were 
raising their children compared with 81 million singleparent 
mothers according to the census bureau 
but the ranks of these fathers are growing by more than 50 
percent compared with 16 percent for singleparent mothers in the 
first seven years of the 1980s greif said 
the jury is still out on whether children fare better with their 
mother or father but generally the outcome seems to be the 
same he said 
greif concludes that in general men find singleparenting much 
more difficult than they thought it would be but very few say 
they regret the choice

the veteran affairs department will reveal 
later this month whether it plans to limit compensation to veterans 
who suffered disabling injuries or illnesses while in uniform 
the announcement one of several changes resulting from a 
yearlong inhouse study of medical and compensation programs is 
bound to add to the aggravation of groups such as the disabled 
american veterans and american legion 
the veterans organizations have been highly suspicious of the 
vas internal deliberations especially the review of 
serviceconnected benefits 
the disabled american veterans last february forced the va to 
acknowledge it had been conducting the review the group recently 
sent out a recruiting letter that began with the word betrayal 
an american legion official john f sommer said va studies 
should be done in a way that people are aware of what is being 
looked at 
the secrecy fueled a widespread fear that the white house was 
targeting veterans programs for budget cuts 
veterans receive monthly payments of 76 to 1500 depending on 
disability for injuries or illnesses that occurred during active 
service the only exception is for reckless behavior spouses or 
dependents also can receive payments 
some 28 million veterans along with 900000 surviving spouses 
and other dependents receive more than 16 billion yearly in va 
benefits 
the va insists it will not try to reduce benefits for people 
already receiving them and congress would have to approve most 
changes 
the va argues that disabilities or deaths should be directly 
related injuries or diseases that occur as a result of job duties 
the va and others question whether an afterhours sports injury 
should be compensable more importantly they question automatic 
compensation for heart disease diabetes chronic bronchitis 
arthritis hemorrhoids and multiple sclerosis diseases that may 
be brought on by heredity bad habits or age 
a general accounting office report last year said the government 
paid 17 billion to veterans with those and related diseases in 
1986 
these diseases are compensable if they become manifest during 
service or within a year after a person leaves the military some 
within a longer period afterward 
its a philosophical issue said deputy va secretary anthony 
j principi who is leading the study 
veterans groups argue that there are no after hours in the armed 
services and that is the reason behind the automatic presumption 
of service connection 
you cant compare it to being in a civilian job said 
sommer soldiers sailors and fliers live under constant alert 
risk and stress regardless of what they might be doing at a given 
moment he argues

the french are celebrating with unprecedented 
fanfare the 50th anniversary of charles de gaulles historic appeal 
for armed resistance against nazi tyranny 
yet few people actually heard the radio broadcast and many 
french people though they might deny it now were content with 
the leaders who had just surrendered to hitler 
known as the appel of june 18 de gaulles fervent 
fourminute speech was addressed to soldiers and civilians in 
england and france 
in a deep gravelly voice edged with tension he asked must 
we abandon all hope is our defeat final no france is not 
alone the flame of french resistance must not and shall not 
die 
but the army was in disarray and most civilians were fleeing 
their homes the chaos and panic were such that 90000 families 
reported having lost children during the mass exodus 
many of those who did manage to tune in the bbc on their wartime 
wireless radios sought assurances from 84yearold philippe petain 
a bemedalled world war i field marshal who had urged premier paul 
reynaud to sign the armistice the previous day 
regis debray a former adviser to president francois mitterrand 
has suggested in a recent book that in june 1940 nine out of 10 
french supported petain in fact by the end of the summer only 
7000 people had reached de gaulles london headquarters 
the vast majority of the french saw de gaulle as a brash rebel 
who fled his native soil hours after france capitulated to join 
forces with an old enemy england 
by contrast the grandfatherly taciturn petain known as the 
hero of verdun urged an end to the conflict which he believed 
france could never win 
petains popularity began to fade only after vichyled police 
zealously rounded up jews for deportation to concentration camps 
123000 died and began sending french workers to germany 
fifty years later the french are celebrating their national 
hero unreservedly with virtually no reminders of the 
collaborationist regime or tolerance of nazism that de gaulle 
vigorously condemned 
instead politicians try to capitalize on his legacy each vying 
to appear as his heir 
sound and light extravaganzas will reenact the dramatic moments 
of the war including the nazi invasion the june 18 appeal and the 
liberation 
paris has been plastered with 6000 posters recalling the 
highlights of de gaulles career art exhibitions documentaries 
and television specials even a computer game recapture the 
grandeur and charisma of le general 
a giant replica of the wireless the kind that ordinary 
citizens would later risk their lives listening to will be 
erected at the place de la concorde and will broadcast de gaulles 
wartime speeches from dawn to dusk on june 18 
retired gen andre delpech a resistance fighter who was 
tortured and sent to dachau in 1944 remembers the excitement of 
the june 18 appeal he was then 15 
somehow news had reached our remote hamlet that some general 
whose name we didnt know was going to make an important speech 
from london we could barely make out his voice afterwards the 
adults stayed up long into the night discussing the few sentences 
they managed to decipher 
meanwhile radio announcers reread the appeal during the evening 
and into the wee hours of the morning the following day de gaulle 
again took the microphone to express his firm belief that he 
spoke in the name of france 
ici londres this is london became a codeword for the 
resistance opening nightly broadcasts that provided news from the 
free world and transmitted coded messages to underground networks 
in france 
political journalist robert quiriconi was a high school student 
in algeria when de gaulle founded the free french movement and 
hoisted the french tricolor over his london home 
at flagraising ceremonies we were supposed to sing a song 
praising petain instead of the marseillaise he said i had 
heard about de gaulle from my classmates and from then on we were 
gaullists and refused to sing

bigcity mayors are leading an effort to pressure 
the federal government to increase spending on drug poverty 
housing and other urban problems 
the mayors opened their annual summer meeting friday by 
denouncing the 1980s as a decade of neglect of americas cities 
and attacking congress and the white house for spending billions on 
foreign aid the savings and loan bailout and other programs while 
cutting aid to cities 
we have to do something san diego mayor maureen oconnor 
said in urging fellow mayors to be more militant in their lobbying 
of congress and the bush administration our pleas have been 
falling on deaf ears 
the host mayor for us conference of mayors session chicagos 
richard m daley chastised administration officials drug czar 
william bennett for one who have accused the mayors of whining in 
asking for more federal help 
i dont think were whining i dont think were crying 
daley said theyve become isolated from the country 
this morning daley led more than 100 mayors in his citys third 
annual say no to drugs parade more than 100 bands one from as 
far away as texas joined the mayors in the parade 
the opening day of the sixday meeting featured a rallystyle 
joint gathering of conference task forces on drugs and 
homelessness several mayors warned that festering racial and 
ethnic tensions in major cities could explode unless city and 
federal governments work together to address housing needs and 
poverty which the mayors blamed for exacerbating drug use and 
violence 
if we wait until there is a crisis it will be too late said 
philadelphia mayor w wilson goode we have the opportunity to 
deal with it before it gets out of hand 
fridays opening session was full of antiwashington rhetoric 
but short on specific solutions the chairman of the session 
boston mayor raymond flynn said he wanted an open discussion of 
urban problems from which the mayors could draft proposed policy 
statements for the conference to consider next week 
flynn opened the session with a scathing attack on federal 
spending priorities 
federal policy towards our cities and towards economic 
opportunity today is as bankrupt as the corrupt savings and loans 
which are robbing our young peoples future he said 
while we waited at washingtons back door for a few crumbs for 
urban america these bandits heisted over 300 billion from our 
nations treasury flynn said 
these are funds that could have been used for job training 
for college scholarships for helping young families buy their 
first home as well as building a national economy set to compete 
with europe and japan 
flynn chairman of the task force on homelessness was among 
mayors blaming federal aid cutbacks they said have left cities too 
poor to provide job training to keep youths off streets and away 
from crime the mayors hope to lobby collectively for money they 
believe can be saved from a reduced need for military spending 
the mayors are expected to request that more antidrug money go 
directly to cities instead of states but the national governors 
association said in a letter to the mayors made public friday that 
it favored the current system under which states can award grants 
to cities but have latitude in spending the federal money

few men could have felt as utterly alone as 
charles de gaulle on the evening of june 18 1940 
as the tall uniformed french general strode into the london 
studios of the bbc to make his first broadcast to france his 
country was collapsing under the german blitzkrieg its government 
was suing for peace a shellshocked populace was resigned to defeat 
de gaulles gamble seemed a pathetic exercise in selfdelusion 
at 49 virtually unknown outside military circles he lacked 
troops guns money and friends the collaborationist french 
government would shortly sentence him to death 
de gaulle wrote later that he felt like the survivor of a 
shipwreck a man on the shore of an ocean proposing to swim 
across 
fifty years later de gaulles broadcast is a hallowed memory 
for france a symbol of defiance against all odds but in 1940 
there was no rush to his banner 
de gaulle had led his tanks gallantly against the german 
onslaught and remained in france until june 17 leaving for england 
only when defeat became inevitable 
the british had hoped leading politicians would come to carry on 
the fight and winston churchill was disappointed that no one more 
senior than de gaulle showed up 
but the british prime minister immediately recognized the 
general as a comrade de gaulle correctly predicted the americans 
and soviets would join the war and that hitler would go down in 
five years 
that kind of fighting talk appealed to churchill you are 
alone well i shall recognize you alone he told de gaulle on 
june 27 
the relationship between the two titans soon faltered de 
gaulle an instinctive anglophobe showed his hosts little 
gratitude 
he could be breathtakingly arrogant petty setbacks sent him 
into rages leonard miall a bbc editor remembers de gaulles fury 
because his june 18 broadcast was not recorded for posterity 
the bbcs equipment was needed that day to record churchills 
this was their finest hour speech but de gaulle wasnt 
interested in excuses 
he tore strips off the bbc in general and me in particular for 
failing to appreciate the historical importance of the occasion 
miall said in an interview i had never encountered such an angry 
man 
churchill complained of de gaulles insufferable rudeness 
the americans felt the same franklin d roosevelt mocked the 
generals pretensions dwight d eisenhower couldnt stand him 
mary borden an english novelist who knew de gaulle wrote 
understandingly to come to the british as a suppliant with the 
disgrace of his nation burned on his forehead and in his heart was 
intolerable but he could look to no one else his own people 
failed him the french officials reviled or snubbed him the troops 
turned their back on him the response to his appeal was pitiable 
the weaker his position the more arrogant he became 
driven by a mystical faith in frances greatness de gaulle was 
loftily unrepentant 
i shall yield nothing of the elements which make up that 
greatness he told a visitor in london the weaker i am the 
more intransigent i shall be in defending our rights 
as the allies gained the upper hand de gaulles free french 
army swelled and when france was chosen for the allied invasion of 
europe the general and his army assumed greater importance 
de gaulles war was an epic human drama its repercussions 
reflected in his bouts of hostility toward britain and the united 
states lasted through his decade as president of france until his 
death in 1970 
militarily his role in world war ii was not crucial but his 
primary goal in london was to pick up the broken sword and 
transform france from humiliated collaborator to victorious ally 
in that the lonely cantankerous courageous visionary 
triumphed utterly

the miner scrambled on all fours 
through mud along shaft no 6 in the red star mine cursing as he 
knocked loose a support 
his helmet lamp bobbed in the gloom as he jammed the metal jack 
back under roughcut ceiling beams in the low tunnel in the heart 
of the donetsk basin the largest soviet coal field 
the miners more than a quartermile beneath makeyevka were 
smeared with black mud their clothes soaked with water their 
lungs tormented with sickness and their hearts full of bitterness 
toward the communist party and government 
a halfdozen miners lay down their tools to speak to an american 
correspondent who had crawled 500 feet along a low tunnel to talk 
with them and see their working conditions 
this is how we work said a miner named alexander lying on 
his side using a broadbladed shovel to ladle lumps of hard coal 
onto a conveyer belt driven by chains that roared a few inches 
from his nose 
a coworker named sergei lifted a drill and long bit to show how 
he chipped away coal he was stooped over unable to sit upright in 
the cramped tunnel both miners identified themselves only by first 
names 
nine miles to the west of the red star lode the first congress 
of soviet miners passed resolutions of no confidence in the party 
and threatened to strike july 11 if prime minister nikolai i 
ryzhkovs government does not resign 
another resolution expressed no confidence in the communist 
party presenting president mikhail s gorbachev also the party 
general secretary with one of his toughest tests yet in 
maintaining popular support 
last summer half of the nations 1 million miners sent a 
similar shock through the soviet union by striking for safer 
working conditions better housing and increased deliveries of meat 
and soap miners also demanded a greater voice in setting prices 
and production quotas 
the miners say the government hasnt delivered and they have 
lost faith in the party 
the miners meeting decided to reconvene in august to form the 
first independent nationally organized union since the days of 
lenin 
down in the red star mine the workers said new unions were 
needed 
none of us are party members down here sergei said i 
dont know whether there will be a strike but ill take part if 
there is one 
food is the most important thing meat alexander said 
as the reporter crawled away a pneumatic hose burst underneath 
him hissing filled the air and a miner rushed to fix it 
dont worry its nothing said igor n shapovalov deputy 
chief engineer at the mine 
shapovalov 29 says hell remain in the communist party despite 
its unpopularity among the miners and the likelihood that it will 
split at a party meeting next month 
despite his loyalty shapovalov said he supported the strike 
last year and he acknowledges that conditions in the mines are 
poor 
imagine they sit in that water for six hours a day in that 
moisture they get sick all the time said shapovalov 
during the tour he pointed out an improperly prepared cable 
used to haul trains along mine tunnels 
this should have a sheath he said gesturing at an exposed 
cable loop that had not yet begun to fray 
and this should have a clasp he said pointing at the knot 
that completed the loop this could give way while miners were in 
the train and they could get hurt 
he also demonstrated a gas meter designed to detect dangerous 
concentrations of methane 
pockets of methane explode within the last two weeks gas 
explosions have killed six miners in donetsk and 12 in the kuznetsk 
coal basin in western siberia 
in the last five months 33 soviet miners have perished the 
newspaper trud reported saturday the death toll in both 1988 and 
1989 was 93 
on friday john j banovic international secretarytreasurer of 
the united mines workers of america told the miners meeting that 
his union would help them found an independent union and work to 
improve conditions 
listening to a description of the red star mine he said it 
sounds like late 18th century or early 19th century mining to me 
wed close down a mine like that straight away 
shapovalov a blond 6footer acknowledged his mine might close 
if the government moves from a planned to a market economy 
if this mine closes ill find other work we defeated the 
fascists we can live through this he said evoking memories of 
world war ii when the choices facing soviet workers seemed much 
simpler

rudyard kipling meant the world and not 
congress when he wrote that east is east and west is west but 
debate last week on capitol hill showed that the twain have a hard 
time meeting here 
on the house and senate floor western lawmakers complained 
about being misunderstood by their colleagues from the east the 
legislative battles naturally enough were over land timber 
water and minerals exploitation versus preservation 
in the senate the debate was over the tongass national forest 
which covers an area of alaska that is larger than west virginia 
in the house the debate was over irrigating vast farms 
it is very difficult for a senator from ohio to understand 
what it is like to be a public land state sen jake garn 
rutah said during debate on the environmentalistbacked tongass 
bill which would restrict logging in the temperate rain forest 
sen howard metzenbaum a cleveland democrat had just finished 
arguing against an amendment that would have had the government 
trade away mineral rights without knowing their true value 
garn said he wished that twothirds of ohio was owned by the 
federal government so that i could stand up here and talk about 
what the county commissioners would do if they only had 
onethird of the land to tax and the mayors the city councils 
the governor and how you provide roads police and fire protection 
without that tax revenue 
garn argued that the mining corporations like kennecott in his 
home state provide the tax base to compensate for having only 4 
percent private land in some counties kennecott is one of the 
companies that extract silver and gold from an existing mine in 
tongass and would profit from the land trade which has been put in 
the abeyance even though the overall tongass bill was approved 990 
alaskas senators ted stevens and frank h murkowski supported 
the bill because it restricted logging less than a housepassed 
version would both argued that although oldgrowth timber needs to 
be preserved so does an industry that sustains 25 percent of the 
economy in the states southeast 
acknowledging that he had gone off the subject of the amendment 
being debated garn said other western states had high percentages 
of publicly held land alaska is 90 percent he said 
in the house the next day rep robert f smith rore 
complained about legislation by connecticut democrat sam gejdenson 
to make farmers chose between crop subsidies or subsidized water 
the gentleman argues that there is something uniquely wrong 
about receiving reclamation water and farm program benefits 
smith said arguing that the 1902 act that set up water reclamation 
projects was intended to promote permanent western settlement 
and i would suggest that if it is the gentleman from 
connecticuts intention to highlight federal spending and 
wasteful federal spending at that he might look in his own 
backyard 
smith said reclamation projects in oregon account for far less 
than the billions spent by the government to build submarines and 
helicopters in connecticut the fifthlargest recipient per capita 
of defense dollars 
the gejdenson measure passed 33855

hundreds of reformminded communist party members 
gathered saturday to debate when and how to break away from the 
party and form an opposition group 
one leader of the democratic platform movement argued for an 
immediate break saying that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
would not be able to reform the communist party enough at a coming 
party meeting to avoid a split 
the communist party cannot be reformed cannot be 
transformed said igor b chubais a philosopher and one of the 
leaders of democratic platform 
democratic platform founded about six months ago has counted 
among its members boris n yeltsin recently elected president of 
the russian republic and the mayors of moscow and leningrad 
gavriil popov and anatoly sobchak 
but those leaders reduced their activities in the reform group 
when they took on government responsibilities 
the movement now is split on whether it should found a new party 
immediately and take hundreds of thousands of the communist partys 
18 million members with them or wait until after a national party 
congress that begins july 2 
the nationwide gathering of democratic platform members is to 
decide that question before it wraps up its conference sunday 
any split in the party would be the first since the time of 
lenin 
although chubais argued for an immediate break others urged 
caution 
vyacheslav n shostakovsky rector of moscows higher party 
school urged that the reformers wait until after the party 
congress when he said the partys inability to reform will be 
even clearer 
to move too quickly would risk worsening the countrys tense 
political situation he said 
if we appraise things in a sober manner we can see we are 
moving towards and can quickly find ourselves again under an 
authoritarian regime shostakovsky said we are sliding down to 
it 
democratic platform demands the communist party eliminate its 
chapters in enterprises the kgb and the police it wants the 
communist party to transform itself into a parliamentary group that 
struggles with others for political power 
shostakovsky has said that democratic platform probably could 
count on taking a halfmillion supporters out of the party if it 
breaks away 
that would make it the largest single opposition group but 
still much smaller and weaker than the communist party 
many other alternative parties have been formed since the 
communists gave up their constitutional monopoly on power in the 
spring but the overwhelming size and resources of the communist 
party have prevented a genuine multiparty system from developing 
speakers on saturday called for democratic platform to reach out 
to the recently formed social democratic and democratic parties of 
russia to form a movement against the communist party 
surveys taken by shostakovskys institute from january through 
may indicate that more than 40 percent of soviet communists support 
democratic platform compared to only about 20 percent for their 
national leadership 
but in documents released at the meeting the school warned that 
democratic platforms support is soft 
a significant number of party members regarding democratic 
platform with approval dont share many of its ideas but only 
support the fact that an alternative movement has sprung up in the 
soviet communist party it said

whipped cream squirt guns and balloons may 
not seem like conventional weapons in the war against drugs but 
they are an important part of a new hampshire psychologists 
arsenal 
lee wotherspoon approaches the battle against addiction with his 
own army a group called dad or drugs are dangerous 
the organizations mission is to show young people how to have 
fun without drugs and to encourage fathers to get involved in 
their childrens lives 
wotherspoon cofounded dad with ed ahlman of kingston whose son 
chris committed suicide in 1988 wotherspoon had counseled chris 
who was addicted to drugs before his death 
we got together to decide what we could do about the problems 
facing kids especially drugs ahlman said adding that the group 
currently has hundreds of members in new england 
the deficit is for fathers women are out there wanting to do 
whatever they can to help their kids and feeling torn when theyre 
struggling between work and family and children wotherspoon 
said the fathers forget they need to have it pulled together 
for them 
dad sponsors among other things natural high parties 
which feature activities such as squirt gun fights whipped cream 
battles balloon volleyball and limbo contests in the mud fathers 
are encouraged to bring their children to the free events and join 
in the fun 
i dont drink i dont do drugs i dont smoke and if im 
going to have a party i dont want to have a party where people 
stand around and wonder when the next drink is going to be served 
and talk small talk wotherspoon said thats boring to me if 
im going to do one lets have fun with it 
lori knight 17 a student from kingston is a veteran of 
several natural high parties 
i think when kids go to the parties they think of the positive 
things that they can do instead of drugs and the fun times they 
can have she said 
apart from the natural high parties dad also sponsors support 
groups and a helpline and provides tool kits packages of 
advice that help fathers deal with childrens problems 
wotherspoon said its important not only to give kids 
alternatives to drugs but to start driving the message home early 
we cant wait until our kids lives get burned to throw foam 
on the fire we need a fire prevention program and thats what dad 
tries to do he said 
im giving kids an antiaddiction message at these parties 
but its not preaching at them its showing them giving them an 
experience of what its like to get a natural high but im also 
showing them hey you can play life for higher stakes 
wotherspoons idea for drugfree fun has counterparts across the 
country in bowling green ohio a group called party for 
promoting awareness toward yourself uses wotherspoons principles 
in the midwest a group called mad dads inc or men against 
destruction defending against drugs and social disorder has taken 
a more militant stance the group has chapters in omaha and grand 
island neb and in denver 
mad dads patrols neighborhoods infested by drugdealers and 
gangs in an effort to drive them out and paints over gang 
graffiti they also sponsor parties free of drugs and alcohol for 
teenagers 
we touch people that other social programs have overlooked 
said ellis edwards a spokesman for the group 
edwards said mad dads also provides a surrogate father program 
most of our members are fathers but we all also act as 
surrogate fathers for youth on the street kids who have come from 
broken homes or who dont have the guidance they need in life 
edwards said 
currently wotherspoon travels across the country helping groups 
organize their own natural high events he said he has sponsored 
parties at colleges and universities where he says the principle 
of fun tends to work just as well with more sophisticated groups 
the idea however is to catch kids at a young age to 
immunize them against a future of drugs and the best way to do 
that is positive reinforcement 
some seeds die and some seeds grow some take root and become 
fine big trees he said the best we can do is try and help 
that if you want a good garden dont water the weeds

refugees registered with the united nations and an unknown number 
of unregistered refugees and other occupants 
the fighting followed the assassination of a plo official at his 
home in rashidiyeh on friday no group has claimed responsibility 
for the killing but a plo statement blamed it on israeli 
collaborators seeking to trigger a war between arafat loyalists 
and opponents in the camps 
fatahrevolutionary council and fatah are at odds because of a 
bitter feud over policy between abu nidal whose real name is sabri

a day at the beach on south 
padre island wouldnt be complete without gooey black tar that 
visitors often take home on their car carpeting or beach towels 
petroleum gunk and maritime garbage are regulars on a coastline 
coming under assault from the leaking supertanker mega borg 
despite the abuse though texas 600 miles of gulf coast 
encompass some vital wildlife areas 
the state has taken the brunt of some of the worst us oil 
spills not to mention many smaller littlenoticed discharges 
that come with heavy tanker traffic 
texas ports handle some 225 million tons of oil products 
annually according to land commissioner garry mauro 
texas beaches normally arent what youd call pure white 
sand said david sager of the texas parks and wildlife 
departments resource protection division we do seem to have a 
problem with oil spills and ocean trash 
in fact its a challenge to walk along the states beaches 
without stepping in sticky black tar many coastal hotels provide 
guests with tar remover scientists say some of the tar comes from 
natural oceanfloor seepage but the tar coating grows considerably 
after major oil spills 
unfortunately there are those who dont want the oil industry 
to be held responsible for any of the tar and want to say its all 
natural said tony amos a senior researcher with the university 
of texas marine science institute at port aransas 
amos has surveyed the beach at mustang island in south texas 
every other day since 1978 
he found 1979 was a particularly bad year after the huge ixtoc 
i well blowout off mexicos bay of campeche and the burmah agate 
tanker spill of up to 107 million gallons of oil in galveston bay 
the burmah agate was the second worst us spill topped only by 
last years exxon valdez disaster off alaska 
amos in 1979 found huge accumulations of beach tar and at one 
point encountered 90 percent of shore birds with at least some oil 
on them 
in the latest spill more than 4 million gallons of oil escaped 
from the mega borg after it exploded june 8 and caught fire 57 
miles off the galveston coast 
coast guard officials said saturday that most of the spill 
either burned or evaporated and that an estimated 12000 to 40000 
gallons remained in the water in a slick stretching for miles and 
heading toward the galveston area 
the leading edge is still 25 miles away its only moving two 
miles a day said chief petty officer gene maestas in galveston 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said it was 
possible however that some oil could come ashore as early as 
sunday 
scientists originally feared the oil might come ashore south of 
galveston between freeport and corpus christi because endangered 
brown pelicans breed there at this time of year and could have 
suffer a devastating blow said kenneth schwindt assistant manager 
of the aransas national wildlife refuge 
it also could have hurt the areas struggling endangered 
southern bald eagles peregrine falcons and sea turtles 
the worlds only breeding flock of whooping cranes winters at 
the aransas refuge but the spill probably would not have hurt the 
more than 150 whoopers expected to return this year schwindt said 
the barrier islands running parallel to the coast protect their 
marsh habitat he said 
those barrier islands also catch tons of plastic and other trash 
dumped from ships and drilling rigs in the gulf 
volunteers have picked up some 1250 tons of international 
garbage from texas beaches since the states general land office 
began semiannual beach cleanups in 1987 up to 70 percent of the 
garbage was made of plastic according to the land office 
currents in the gulf tend to send the trash ashore in texas 
rather than other states said ron calhoun a land office spokesman 
in austin 
they ships have been doing it for thousands of years but 
now that theyve got plastic it washes up on texas beaches 
calhoun said

national guardsmen and police dogs combed 
riverbanks and roamed wrecked homes and businesses today in search 
of more than 50 people missing after a killer flash flood 
at least 12 people died late thursday when a wall of water 
enveloped the fringes of this eastern ohio village a thunderstorm 
dumped 5 inches of rain in 3 hours overflowing two creeks and 
swelling the ohio river 
the damage was extraordinary it was something that was 
beyond what ive seen from tornadoes and floods previously one can 
only imagine what it was like gov richard celeste said this 
morning after making his second flight over the area the shock 
of the wall of water as it roared through a very confined area 
literally flattened everything 
floodravaged areas were sealed off today so police dog teams 
from as far away as maryland and kentucky and members of the ohio 
national guard could search for the missing 
the body of a 5yearold girl was pulled late this morning from 
from mcmahon creek northwest of the primary search area said 
chuck vogt belmont county coroners investigator 
they have sealed off the area around wegee and pipe creeks to 
everybody but emergency personnel until the search is over to help 
the dogs pick up the scent said stacie gilg a spokeswoman for 
the ohio emergency management agency 
adjutant gen richard alexander commander of the ohio national 
guard said 341 guard personnel including 130 engineers were 
assisting in search and rescue and rebuilding efforts officials 
from west virginia and the us coast guard were also taking part 
the highway patrol reported at least 60 people unaccountedfor 
ms gilg said the belmont county sheriffs department reported 51 
people missing 
houses and businesses were washed away roads were damaged and 
families were scattered in the flash flood which caught the 
national weather service off guard alexander said at least 60 
homes were destroyed and at least 50 others were damaged 
its hard to explain gregg warren trustee in nearby mead 
township said friday its unbelievable a creek you could walk 
across with water up to your ankles in some places rose 15 to 25 
feet 
a 9yearold girl amber colvin survived for seven hours on the 
ohio river by clinging to logs and doing the dog paddle the only 
swimming stroke she knows after she was washed out of her home by 
floodwater 
the girl found seven miles from home was hospitalized in fair 
condition with minor scrapes and bruises she said she was swept 
from a bathtub when the house began to fill with water a 
12yearold friend of ambers remained missing 
we got in the bathtub and the water was over our heads and 
then the house collapsed amber said friday 
the federal emergency management agency on friday declared as 
disaster areas belmont county where shadyside is located and 
nearby jefferson county franklin county in central ohio also was 
included in the disaster declaration because of flooding there 
the declaration makes residents eligible for federal aid 
celeste who flew over the area friday and again this morning 
said he had not seen so much damage since a tornado ripped through 
xenia in western ohio in 1974 killing 37 people 
a wall of water wiped a path through the area celeste said 
ohios two us senators john glenn and howard metzenbaum also 
toured the area friday 
when children and adults perish in such a disaster as this 
its very hard to know how to react metzenbaum said 
glenn called the flooddamaged portions of the city of 4300 
people a war zone 
chuck vogt an investigator for the belmont county coroners 
office said all of the dead were from either shadyside or mead 
township where the two creeks run south of shadyside 
shadyside is about 10 miles south of wheeling wva 
at least five houses along the wegee creek were washed away and 
two cars floated friday in water in one of the basements 
jim leonard of the american red cross said relief teams set up a 
shelter at an elementary school about 200 people came and went 
during the day friday most sought news of friends or relatives 
doctors and ministers at the school counseled people who lost 
relatives and friends 
the national weather service did not warn residents because a 
thunderstorm in the area appeared on radar to be less severe than 
it was said al wheeler deputy meteorologist in cleveland 
the weather service issued a flood watch indicating that floods 
along small streams and lowlying areas was possible but it did 
not issue a flood warning which alerts residents to take shelter

colorado springs mayor robert isaac was in the 
middle of a long list of complaints about the federal government 
when he paused with a reminder 
just because youre a republican doesnt mean you have to 
agree with everything that a republican administration does 
isaac said 
such an attitude should prove handy to isaac in his new position 
as president of the us conference of mayors an organization 
dominated by bigcity democratic mayors who blame many festering 
urban problems on sharp cuts in federal aid to cities 
isaac whose city has a population of 280000 leads the mayors 
group at a time when many of its democratic members are sharpening 
their attacks on president bush 
they accuse him of ignoring the needs of cities in housing 
education antidrug and other programs and demand a considerable 
share of any federal budget savings realized through planned 
defense cuts 
when isaac takes over wednesday the final day of the mayors 
annual summer meeting moving into his current slot as vice 
president will be perhaps the organizations most vocal bush 
critic boston mayor raymond flynn 
isaac realizes hell face partisan pressure to tone down the 
organizations criticisms of the bush administration the white 
house and political party officials routinely lobby mayors 
im elected to do a job and you can be sure thats what im 
going to do isaac said in an interview i may not always agree 
with my colleagues but after the votes are taken and the positions 
adopted im going to be carrying out those policies as best i 
can 
isaac already shares many of the concerns of his bigcity 
democratic colleagues 
he is highly critical of sending federal antidrug aid to states 
and forcing cities to compete for assistance and wait longer for 
aid he supports tough law enforcement in the drug war but says 
cities also need much more money to reduce demand through by 
treating users 
and isaac says the mayors need to put more pressure on the 
administration and congress to spend more of the billions of 
dollars piling up in highway and aviation trust funds money the 
white house and many in congress are reluctant to spend because the 
balances of those accounts help hide the true size of the federal 
deficit 
this money ought to be spent as it was designed to be spent 
he said 
isaacs greatest complaint is that mayors those of us who 
make decisions at the lowest level of government and provide the 
most services are not consulted enough when the federal 
government placed new demands on governments 
we have considerable mandates and requirements placed on us by 
the federal government but less and less money to carry them out 
isaac said i have always rejected the approach that funding of 
the cities was a handout there are certain functions of the cities 
that certainly the federal government ought to be involved in 
paying for 
isaac succeeds houston mayor kathryn whitmire a democrat as 
conference president flynn will be in line to succeed isaac next 
year 
many democratic mayors were disappointed that ms whitmire was 
not more vocal in her criticism of bush who has adopted her city 
as his hometown and who had her as a guest at the white house 
during a january meeting of the mayors in washington her only 
outspoken criticism of the administration has focused on spending 
of federal antidrug money 
flynn won the no 3 conference leadership post last year in an 
unusual partisan floor fight in which ms whitmire sided with 
republican mayors he offered strong praise of isaac and said 
having a republican leader of the conference could help the mayors 
as they lobby for more federal aid 
what we do now cant be interpreted as partisan flynn said 
in an interview bob is a republican somewhat conservative from 
the west and here i am from the east a democrat moderate to 
liberal its hard to ignore that unique combination of concern 
about what is happening to americas cities

blacks staged dozens of 
peaceful rallies nationwide on saturday to commemorate the 1976 
soweto student uprisings that shaped an entire generation of 
antiapartheid activists 
about 20000 blacks most of them young packed a soweto stadium 
to observe june 16 1976 or soweto day when police opened fire on 
black students protesting the education policies of the whiteled 
government 
the youth of soweto is now a great symbol of resistance and 
defiance throughout the world african national congress leader 
walter sisulu told the crowd 
soweto 10 miles outside johannesburg is the countrys largest 
black township with 25 million residents 
the 1976 police shootings in soweto touched off an unprecedented 
wave of unrest that spread throughout the country and lasted 
several months some 500 to 700 blacks died and thousands fled the 
country to join the anc 
many blacks point to the 1976 riots as the time when they became 
active opponents of the whiteled government and its apartheid 
policies of racial segregation 
fourteen years ago we mourned and complained but today we are 
counting our victories anc spokesman popo molefe told tens of 
thousands of blacks at a rally outside the southern city of port 
elizabeth 
the anc the countrys largest black opposition group was 
legalized in february after being banned for 30 years anc leader 
nelson mandela the countrys best known antiapartheid figure was 
released feb 11 after 27 years in prison and is on a highly 
publicized tour of europe north america and africa urging other 
nations to maintain economic sanctions on south africa 
dozens of peaceful soweto day events were held saturday around 
south africa most of them staged by the anc or the rival pan 
africanist congress 
since coming to power last year president fw de klerk has 
allowed peaceful protests that have official permission 
saturday marked the first time since the 1976 riots that 
widespread demonstrations have taken place on soweto day without 
major police intervention 
in one incident in downtown johannesburg police fired tear gas 
to disperse a few dozen black demonstrators saying they did not 
have permission for the protest a black journalist was taken into 
custody according to witnesses 
police also used tear gas to disperse rallies in natal province 
the one region where a 4yearold state of emergency remains in 
effect de klerk lifted the emergency in the rest of the country 
june 9 
in the central town of welkom about 250 members of the white 
supremacist afrikaner resistance movement marched to protest the 
detention without charge of two whites 
members dressed in khaki uniforms gave stiffarmed nazistyle 
salutes and chanted hang nelson mandela they then marched 
to a nearby police station and handed in a petition protesting the 
detentions 
the two men are being held in connection with separate bomb 
attacks in pretoria and welkom but no one has been charged in 
either case 
the 1976 protests were triggered by a government policy to teach 
classes in afrikaans rather than english afrikaans is the language 
of the dutchdescended afrikaners who dominate the government and 
many blacks consider it the language of the oppressor 
every year since 1976 blacks have observed june 16 as an 
unofficial holiday most blacks stay home from school and work 
the anc said that the inferior black education system that 
caused the 1976 unrest still exists black teachers are holding 
strikes and protests throughout the country and some black schools 
in urban areas have been closed for much of the year last year 
only 42 percent of black high school seniors passed their final 
examinations required to receive a diploma 
the governments per pupil expenditure on whites is about five 
times more than on blacks

us army capt robert hamsley returned 
saturday for a heros welcome to this breton village he helped 
liberate nearly 46 years ago from nazi german occupiers 
children waving american and french flags greeted hamsley as he 
was paraded through the village in a world war ii vintage command 
jeep nearly all of plelos 2300 residents turned out to applaud 
a detachment of us marines and french soldiers stood by as 
hamsley 71 was given the chevalier of the legion of honor one of 
the nations most distinguished awards the village sports stadium 
was renamed in his honor 
hamsley of lawrenceburg tenn and orlando fla appeared a 
bit taken aback by the acclaim 
i love you plelo he said in a toast 
at a ceremony at the villages monument to the dead of world war 
ii plelo mayor yves le coqu hailed hamsley as the villages 
american savior 
in august 1944 plelo was occupied by the nazis who were 
preparing to carry out a series of executions when hamsley entered 
the village at the head of a fivetank platoon 
his men wiped out a contingent of the heavily armed germans but 
two days later german antitank guns knocked out four of the five 
tanks and damaged hamsleys own m4 
however hamsley and his crew managed to destroy the guns and 
killed or drove off about 100 gemans 
hamsley received a bronze star for his action and was promoted 
from lieutenant to captain but his action was not even reported in 
the official diaries of the 15th cavalry regiment of gen george 
pattons third army 
the belated recognition was prompted in part by the efforts of a 
history buff who also served in the 15th cavalry robert dwan of 
tuscon ariz dwan along with amateur french historians 
pinpointed hamsley as the hero of plelo 
last year the plelo village council named hamsley an honorary 
citizen in testimony of our gratitude for your courageous action 
of aug 6 1944 which led to the villages liberation 
the mayor then invited hamsley to saturdays ceremony in his 
honor

the israeli authorities on 
saturday reopened the first of six colleges in the occupied lands 
that have been closed for 30 months due to the palestinian uprising 
the reopening of ramallah college of paramedical sciences is 
seen as a test case if it goes well the other arab universities 
in the occupied territories could be allowed to open again too 
the schools have a total of 18000 students 
the palestinian institutions of higher learning were closed by 
the israeli military shortly after the uprising erupted in the west 
bank and the gaza strip in december 1987 the military contended 
the schools were hotbeds of unrest 
the shutdown drew sharp criticism from the united states and 
western europe which said it amounted to collective punishment 
the european parliament at one point recommended that scientific 
cooperation with israel be frozen until the universities and 
colleges in the occupied lands were reopened 
prime minister yitzhak shamir ordered the gradual reopening of 
the schools on may 14 but the order was suspended for a month 
following the may 20 massacre of seven gaza laborers by an israeli 
gunman near tel aviv and the subsequent wave of riots in the 
occupied territories 
there were virtually no classes at the ramallah school on 
saturday because many students failed to appear on the nearby 
jerusalemramallah road long lines of cars were seen at army 
roadblocks and some students said it was hard to pass through 
the college director farsin arabikian that while the school 
was closed some students got married others went abroad and some 
were jailed only 15 of the former 38 nursing students had 
reregistered she said 
the fate of the college is unpredictable and students are 
affected by what is going on outside the college she said 
arabikian expected about 150 students to pursue studies this 
year in the colleges three departments nursing xray and 
medical technology 
on saturday about a dozen students standing outside the 
college a branch of jerusalem university said they hoped their 
studies could continue 
there is a decision by the uprising leadership not to use the 
academic institutions as centers for demonstrations and other 
activities said halil mustafa sarahne 23 from hebron in the 
west bank 
while the school was closed sarahne spent 10 months in 
detention at the ketziot prison camp in the southern negev desert 
for uprisingrelated activities he declined to specify 
now this medical technology student carries a special identity 
card that prohibits him from passing through jerusalem on his way 
to the college 
if police stop me in jerusalem i will automatically be served 
with six months in administrative detention without trial 
sarahne said 
underground leaders of the rebellion have said in recent 
leaflets that resumption of studies was a top priority and that 
students must not give the army an excuse to close schools 
yasser obeid head of the ramallah colleges board of trustees 
said israels coordinator of activities in the occupied 
territories shmuel goren warned him the school would be closed 
again if students start rioting 
goren told the associated press in may that schools would be 
closed immediately if violence recurred 
im not sure they can control their students but at least 
they promised that they can do it he said then 
obeid said he believed the colleges 233 students just want to 
study 
they are very eager to continue their education he said 
the other palestinian universities that remain closed are 
bethlehem university islamic university hebron university 
annajah university and bir zeit university 
during the shutdown instruction has continued in the makeshift 
underground classes but attendance was sporadic and the 
education far below the normal standards

the government and tamil rebels 
declared a ceasefire saturday in another attempt to end a 
7yearold separatist campaign that has claimed more than 11000 
lives 
last year the government gambled it could achieve peace by 
appeasing the rebel tamil tigers that gamble failed last week when 
government and military officials said more than 130 unarmed 
policemen were massacred by the rebels and hundreds more were 
missing 
after the tigers broke an earlier truce on monday at least 376 
people were killed in northern and eastern sri lanka according to 
reports compiled by witnesses military sources and rebel 
officials the government has not given a comprehensive death toll 
saturdays ceasefire came after two days of negotiations 
military officials in colombo and a tiger spokesman in the northern 
rebel stronghold of jaffna said it took effect throughout the north 
and east as scheduled at 6 pm residents in the eastern town of 
batticaloa where the trouble started when the tigers captured the 
police station monday confirmed the shooting had stopped 
the tigers were patrolling batticaloa according to the 
residents who were contacted by telephone from colombo 135 miles 
to the southwest they declined to give further details and spoke 
on condition of anonymity out of fear for their safety 
for the past 13 months president ranasinghe premadasas 
government and tiger leaders had been negotiating on a 
powersharing arrangment designed to draw the guerrillas away from 
the separatist campaign they launched in 1983 and into politics 
the government let the rebels assume many military and civil 
powers but its trust was shattered by the tigers methodical 
attacks in the past week in the north and east the tigers overran 
at least 20 police stations staffed by officers whose orders were 
to surrender not shoot and shot and killed some of their captives 
a few hours before the ceasefire was announced premadasa 
referred to the tigers as terrorists a sharp departure from 
his previous conciliatory efforts 
he warned that unless the attacks stopped they will have to 
face the consequences and face the same fate as sinhalese 
extremists whose leaders were decimated by the government last 
winter 
even before the attacks there had been signs of trouble the 
tigers consisting largely of teenage guerrillas had grown 
increasingly bold in the last few months extracting taxes from 
local businesses and telling the army and police where they could 
and could not go 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
claim the sinhalese majority discriminate against them in jobs and 
education 
after the massacres of the policemen the army and the tigers 
battled for five days for control of key towns in the north and 
along the eastern sea coast 
when the tigers captured the police station in batticaloa they 
allowed its 300 men to take refuge at an air force base or with 
roman catholic priests 
the government perhaps reassured by that told police to 
surrender rather than fight if their stations were attacked 
that was what police did at kalmunai 22 miles south of 
batticaloa of the 115 policeman on duty monday night only one 
lived to tell what had happened 
the sole known survivor a 23yearold officer named piyeratna 
ranaweera said all 115 were blindfolded loaded into three buses 
taken into the jungle forced to lie facedown on the ground and 
sprayed with bullets from t56 assault rifles 
then shots were fired at close range into their heads ranaweera 
said in an interview at kandy general hospital 
his left arm broken by rifle fire and his left ear grazed by a 
bullet he said he crawled out of the heap of bodies after the 
tigers left 
after a 12hour 14mile walk during which he fainted at least 
twice he reached government lines and was flown to kandy in the 
center of the island 
altogether about 800 policemen surrendered to the tigers 
according to the defense ministry the government says it has no 
firm information on their fates 
we still do not have orders to shoot said an officer at 
ampara 13 miles southwest of kalmunai we dont care about 
orders if we come under fire well shoot

a 19thcentury masterpiece was bought 
from one museum by another for 10 million to keep the swimming 
hole in the city 
after a twomonth debate over the possibility of a new york 
auction for the painting by thomas eakins it was purchased by the 
amon carter museum 
the sale will be concluded this week jan keene muhlert 
director of the carter museum said friday 
the fort worth art association governing body of the modern art 
museum of fort worth purchased the swimming hole in 1925 for 
700 but officials recently decided to sell the painting because 
it was unsuited to the moderns collection of post1920 european 
art and post1940 american art 
the painting which had been on loan to the carter museum for 
more than two years was shipped to new york then back to the 
modern while the debate raged about keeping it in the city 
it will be moved back to the carter on tuesday muhlert said 
eakins who lived from 1844 to 1916 was known for his portraits

is fido feeling feeble morris miserable 
conventional cures cant correct it 
take your suffering pet to the acupuncture vet 
after spending 120 hours in florida learning the ancient chinese 
art of acupuncture ellen paul has brought her skills back to 
urbana to improve the health of ailing dogs and cats 
take divot for example a dog with more than the usual canine 
aversion to cats shes allergic to them and when her skin itches 
she tugs at it with her teeth leaving scabs behind 
for the cure divot stood atop a table her paws sliding on 
stainless steel while paul stucke needles in the dogs coat and 
spinned them 
this is the worst part said paul once the needles are 
in they get bored and want to leave 
divot who started treatments early this month was calmer when 
she returned for her second round of treatments last week said her 
owner bob heister 
she doesnt seem to be biting herself as much heister said 
it seems to work 
acupuncture is not a cureall paul said but it does a good 
job for the things it is indicated for and is better than some 
medication she said 
the aim is to treat specified pressure points these known nerve 
pathways in humans have analogs in other animals paul said which 
share many health problems with humans 
the 3000yearold art seems to boost the immune system and ease 
tension said paul who is doing the work without charge while she 
perfects her techniques

ballet dancers from 23 countries begin 
battling toetotoe sunday testing their grace power and 
precision at the international ballet competition 
it is the olympics of the dance world said event spokesman 
tracy harbour 
some of the greatest dancers in the world are here its a way 
for many of them to get money to get credentials to get 
recognition to gain status in the industry he said 
historically this competition is known for launching the careers 
of many dance greats 
bigname former medalists include sovietborn dancers mikhail 
baryshnikov and alexander godunov 
it is the fourth time the competition has been held in the 
mississippi capital and the debut of entrants have come from cuba 
spain and guatemala about 100 men and women dancers most members 
of recognized ballet companies recommended by their directors were 
scheduled to compete 
the competition is held in jackson every four years in other 
years its held in varna bulgaria helsinki finland and moscow 
the event came to mississippi mainly because of efforts by 
thalia mara former artistic director of the jackson ballet in 
1982 congress passed a resolution making jackson the permanent 
us home of the ibc 
after state support ended in 1985 the nonprofit mississippi 
ballet international inc was forced to raise all needed funds 
this year the event was paid for mostly with 1 million donated by 
corporate and private sponsors including a local rugby club 
the jackson area is likely to get more than that back the state 
department of tourism estimated visitors would pump about 25 
million back into the areas economy said mimi dinsmore a 
spokeswoman for the competition 
running through july 1 the competition involves three rounds 
in the first entrants will perform a choice from the classical 
ballet repertoire in the second competitors must perform a 
comtemporary work something choreographed no earlier than 1950 
in the finals dancers must perform in both categories 
winners in the olympicsstyle event will receive gold silver 
and bronze medals and cash awards from 500 to 10000 
but the limelight carries more weight than the medals and cash 
its a springboard its a rare opportunity for the audience 
to see you know the future baryshnikov ms dinsmore said 
and its a rare opportunity for the dancers to get exposure to 
their international peers

the nations mayors took time out saturday from 
bashing washington to fight among themselves over whether the 
constitution should be amended to guarantee cities a set percentage 
of federal revenues 
the debate came as more than 200 mayors got down to business at 
their annual summer conference taking committee action on dozens 
of proposed policy statements on issues ranging from taxes and 
transportation to housing and aids research 
the us conference of mayors human development committee 
endorsed a resoltion calling on congress to pass legislation 
mandating that a fair percentage of federal revenues be 
channeled directly to cities if congress refused to pass such a 
law the resolution would put the mayors on record in favor of a 
constitutional amendment requiring the revenue sharing 
philadelphia mayor w wilson goode led the support of the 
measure saying the mayors needed to make a forceful statement to 
win attention for their concerns in washington 
but a separate committee the mayors panel on urban economic 
policy voted unanimously to oppose the provision calling for a 
constitutional amendment the proposals endorsed saturday need to 
clear another committee sunday in order to be presented to the full 
gathering next week 
the constitution should not be part of the budget process 
fort wayne ind mayor paul helmke said 
that dispute was the only diversion from a day spent largely 
following up fridays opening session attack on congress and the 
bush administration for not sending more aid to cities the mayors 
are virtually unanimous in saying that aid cutbacks in the 1980s 
exacerbated urban housing and education problems and left cities 
too poor to provide drug treatment and other services to the needy 
solutions hinge on the federal government making the urban 
areas and people a top priority host mayor richard m daley of 
chicago said at a morning news conference we basically need an 
administration willing to have some courage and strong leadership 
but many of the proposals popular with the mayors are viewed 
with trepidation in washington among them the mayors position 
that the federal government needs to raise taxes and give some of 
the money raised to cities 
also high on the mayors agenda but controversial in washington 
are proposals to spend more of the billions in aviation and highway 
trust funds for airport and road improvements the huge balances in 
those accounts hide the true size of the federal budget deficit 
the mayors rarely fight among themselves or criticize each 
other but there were a few objections to the attacks on the reagan 
and bush adminstrations led by bigcity democratic mayors 
gop mayor jimmy kemp of meridian miss who was first elected 
as a democrat but switched parties complained that most of the 
resolutions being debated blamed urban problems on republican 
presidents 
thats a bunch of bull he said during the meeting of the 
urban economic policy committee 
in an interview afterward kemp said such attacks divert the 
mayors from more fruitful discussions thats not what were here 
for he said it makes real progress more difficult to 
achieve 
before the saturday meetings dozens of the mayors joined daley 
in the citys third annual say no to drugs parade

stop coincided with commemorations of the june 16 1976 uprising 
in the black township of soweto which left hundreds dead

is the masses of the people who put pressure on their governments 
we cannot win liberation for our country

government to remove the ban on the anc and free him and his 
colleagues mandela is also urging that economic cultural 
diplomatic and sports sanctions be maintained against south africa 
until apartheid is completely abolished

solidarity leader lech walesa persuaded 
farmers saturday to suspend a protest over low milk prices that had 
blocked roads and shut down dairies in northern poland 
it was the second such success for walesa in three weeks on may 
28 he got railroad workers to end a strike that was paralyzing 
polands baltic ports 
the announcement that the protest in the mlawa region 80 miles 
north of warsaw was suspended until july 3 came after three hours 
of talks between walesa and disgruntled farmers 
in both disputes the protesters demanded government 
intervention to protect them from the harsh effects of the 
governments shock treatment to transform polands socialist 
economy into a freemarket system the government however has 
stuck to its vow not to make special concessions 
the farmers complained that their local dairy deeply in debt 
has not yet been paid for milk delivered in may and that the price 
it paid for their milk was cut to 2 cents a quart in june compared 
to 5 to 6 cents in april 
the farmers began blocking the main warsawgdansk highway on 
tuesday along with local roads and the mlawa area dairy plants 
themselves 
rejecting demands for an immediate rise in milk prices the 
solidarityled government friday night sent out scores of police 
equipped with tear gas truncheons and water cannons to wisniewo 
outside mlawa to open the e7 highway blocked by tractors and 
hundreds of protesters 
when the more than 50 police vehicles rolled into town under the 
governments gettough policy the farmers reluctantly lifted the 
blockade of the highway however local roads and dairy plants 
remained blocked until walesa arrived saturday 
arriving in warsaw from switzerland where he addressed a 
meeting of the international labor organization on friday walesa 
drove straight to mlawa to try to solve the dispute 
after the talk the farmers protest committee taking into 
account the higher good agreed to suspend the strike at least 
until july 3 according to a communique given the polish pap news 
agency 
meanwhile the farmers union rural solidarity was to enter into 
negotiations with the government seeking profitable conditions 
for producing milk in ciechanow province and in the country 
waldemar kuczynski a senior adviser to prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki defended the decision to threaten the farmers with 
force in order to reopen the highway 
a decision to use the forces of order is not an easy decision 
and it is not taken with joy he said on the evening tv news show 
saturday the government decided to undertake the decision 
because blocking roads violates the law and threatens to paralyze 
important fields of the countrys life and strikes out at all 
people

two opposition parties on saturday 
pledged to resurrect their prodemocracy movements which were 
targeted in a twoday rampage by coal miners backing 
presidentelect ion iliescu 
iliescu said he was contemplating creation of a national guard 
to protect the government he said it would be composed of clean 
loyal honest people who can act resolutely at exceptional times 
we know that we can rely on you iliescu told the miners 
friday before sending them home his comments were carried on 
romanian radio and monitored by the bbc 
the center of the city was quiet saturday helmeted police with 
automatic weapons guarded government buildings and university 
square the site of a 53day antigovernment rally that riot police 
ended wednesday by firing on demonstrators 
the state news agency rompres said six people were killed and 
502 injured in violence from wednesday through friday the worst in 
romania since the uprising that toppled communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu in december 
at least 110 people were still hospitalized seven of them with 
very serious injuries rompres quoted health ministry officials as 
saying 
security officials detained 1021 suspects in the 
antigovernment rioting the government said saturday 
the miners had been asked to restore order on the square 
protesters gathered there had demanded excommunists like iliescu 
be banned from politics 
the miners swinging iron bars and clubs swarmed bucharest on 
thursday and friday attacking anyone they suspected of being 
against the government 
among their targets was the headquarters of the national 
peasants party 
standing there saturday among shards of broken glass smashed 
typewriters and furniture party secretarygeneral liviu petrina 
said the struggle for democracy would continue 
emotionally we are ready to start today he told a reporter 
logistically it could take weeks 
the liberal party headquarters also were trashed by the miners 
calin tarceanu a liberal party official said leaders are 
afraid for our lives because nobody is protecting us 
dinu patriciu another party official said the liberals would 
continue to function as a free political party despite the 
intimidation 
the miners injured or threatened other government critics and 
student leaders who contended iliescu and other key figures of the 
government sought to revive totalitarian rule 
they also threatened to close down four opposition publications 
one the romania libera daily said saturday it had not resumed 
printing because its workers feared a threat by the miners to 
return and destroy the papers offices even if the government 
allowed it to reappear 
iliescu blamed the antigovernment riots on rightwing 
extremists whom he charged were aided from abroad 
we are dealing here with a broader scenario of european 
proportions iliescu said there was a joint action of 
rightwing forces which started from the presumption that 
rightwing forces in all east european countries could come to 
power 
radu campeanu leader of the opposition liberal party told 
reporters iliescus accusations were childish and part of an old 
communist pattern 
although iliescu and his national salvation front government 
overwhelmingly won free elections last month his critics demanded 
he and other former communist party leaders be banned from politics 
for 10 years 
the fronts dominant role since ceausescus overthrow has left 
other political voices little room to express their views except on 
the street 
there was still no word saturday on why miners were summoned 
instead of relying on police or soldiers to reestablish order 
speculation about tensions between the interior and defense 
ministries intensified after the state rompres news agency 
published an open letter apparently from the army disavowing 
responsibility for the clashes with antigovernment demonstrators 
western governments condemned the violence 
us state department spokesman richard boucher said friday that 
all but humanitarian aid would be withheld and the european 
community postponed a trade and economic agreement with romania 
the miners among ceausescus most outspoken critics have 
strongly backed iliescu who gave them pay rises and improved their 
working conditions soon after taking power

leaders of hungarys new democracy on 
saturday paid homage to imre nagy the leader of the 1956 
anticommunist uprising on the 32nd anniversary of his execution 
the quiet laying of flowers at his graveside contrasted sharply 
with the ceremonial reburial of nagys remains last year attended 
by hundreds of thousands of hungarians in a show of support for 
democratization 
this year government officials joined relatives of nagy and his 
associates who were executed in 1958 but posthumously rehabilitated 
last year 
the officials in attendance included premier jozsef antall and 
interim president arpad goencz who himself was sentenced to life 
in prison for his role in the 1956 uprising after it was put down 
by soviet troops 
hundreds of hungarians also laid flowers at the graves 
the new government was sworn in last month after march elections 
that relegated the reformed communists to a minor role 
the first law passed by the new parliament elected in the first 
free elections in 43 years made oct 23 the day the 1956 
uprising began a national holiday 
the new government has also gone on record as saying it wants to 
quit the warsaw pact the nagy government had also said hungary 
would withdraw from the pact

betty ellis a 64yearold minneapolis 
housewife says intellectual curiosity drew her to join nine 
others sunday on a 10day journey billed as appalachia third 
world in the united states 
global exchange a nonprofit research education and action 
center in san francisco that arranged the reality tour hopes 
it will lead mrs ellis and her fellow travelers on a path to 
political activism 
political awareness tours cater to a different breed from the 
adventure or educational trips promoted by many travel agencies 
and might be considered the opposite of club meds antidote to 
civilization 
tour members give up luxury hotels museums monuments and 
romantic dinners to take the opportunity to reshape their views of 
the world 
the 500 per person appalachian tour for example will go to 
tennessee kentucky and virginia to visit a child care center 
agricultural food and housing projects the mountain womens 
exchange and the highlander center in new market tenn which has 
fought poverty racism sexism and environmental destruction since 
the 1930s 
there wont be any whiskeysipping with toothless old men in 
overalls whittling cedar sticks at a country store as a 
tennessee columnist wrote in conjuring up stereotypes the tourists 
might be looking for 
global exchanges tours in fact are supposed to break down 
stereotypes inspire people to get involved in community 
organizations and build ties between people in developed and 
developing areas the socalled first and third worlds 
poverty can be found in every state global exchange is 
planning other us trips that may include the san francisco bay 
area but the group chose appalachia because of its inspiring 
example and rich history of organizing 
we felt it was very important to highlight community 
organizing in the united states as well as the third world said 
laurie adams tour coordinator for global exchange we dont feel 
you have to go all the way to the third world to see some of the 
problems that are facing communities there 
grassroots organizing is a key aspect of the new activism of the 
1990s an outgrowth of the citizen diplomacy efforts of the past 
decade and a step beyond the protest movements of the 60s and 
70s participants span a wide range of ages and professions 
we encourage people on the tours to get involved afterward 
but in whatever ways that are comfortable for them said adams 
24 weve had grandmothers come and get articles published in 
local papers its encouraging to see that it takes some courage 
and wanting to have a challenge to go on these trips but you can 
have a lot of fun too 
global exchange claims 5000 members nationwide but has a staff 
of only five working in a modest office in an ethnically diverse 
part of san francisco two other staff members run a store in the 
city that sells arts and crafts from the third world and two 
staffers work in haiti and honduras 
the group founded 1 years ago has published books and 
promoted speakers on us policy third world issues and grassroots 
organizing in the past year it also has run trips to haiti india 
honduras el salvador nicaragua brazil mozambique and zimbabwe 
among the people who have gone on the trips are community 
workers and those seeking alternatives to typical vacations 
ranging in age from 18 to 75 and including doctors nurses city 
officials nuns business people lawyers and housewives 
rachel chapman a health worker in los angeles went to 
mozambique and zimbabwe and said she met people in high levels in 
the government and families in the countryside 
the personal interaction stimulates and helps each of us 
become more capable as leaders she said 
the trip to appalachia initially set off a storm of adverse 
publicity and in may west virgina was dropped from the tour 
of course not all of appalachia resembles the third world 
adams said just as in brazil there are wealthy parts and poor 
parts but some of the characteristics are the same 
the resources such as coal are extracted for the benefit of 
rich outsiders while local workers live in poverty and face 
dangerous working conditions a lot of the control is in the hands 
of distant politicians and corporate boards not in the hands of 
local people environmental destruction is wrought by things such 
as the coal mining industry and health care education and 
transportation systems arent fairly distributed

a washington woman may have helped 
establish a national day for dad but folks in this coalmining 
town claim they laid the groundwork 
id like to describe it as a goodnatured rivalry said 
harold goff historian for the central united methodist church 
which claims to have held the first fathers day observance on july 
5 1908 
weve established it using several welldocumented books and 
people who participated goff said even the greeting card 
companies have been receptive about the only outfit weve gotten 
short shrift from is the national fathers day council 
ted kaufman executive director of the nonprofit council based 
in new york said he doesnt dispute that the town held the church 
service honoring fathers 
but as far as were concerned the first fathers day 
observance was in spokane wash by sonora smart dodd in 1910 
kaufman said in a telephone interview all we know is the 
movement for a national fathers day started from that event 
no matter who gets the credit hallmark cards inc spokeswoman 
barbara miller said sons and daughters nationwide will mail or 
handdeliver about 90 million fathers day greeting cards this year 
the holiday is the fifthlargest for greeting card manufacturers 
behind christmas valentines day easter and mothers day the 
spokeswoman said from company headquarters in kansas city mo 
road signs declaring fairmont the home of fathers day and a 
plaque marking the site of the first observance have been in place 
in since 1984 when the town first began publicizing its claim 
weve held fathers day services continually since 1908 but 
any attempt to get wider attention has kind of languished goff 
said were not saying were responsible for the national 
holiday just the first observance 
mike archer a spokesman for the spokane chamber of commerce 
said woodrow wilson first proclaimed fathers day in 1916 based on 
mrs dodds efforts 
i guess well go with that to back up our claim archer said 
in a telephone interview we use it in our brochures about the 
city 
fairmonts claim centers on mrs charles clayton who lobbied 
the congregation of the williams memorial combined methodist and 
episcopal church to honor fathers after mothers day was celebrated 
in nearby grafton two months earlier 
now a dying railroad town of about 3000 grafton still receives 
national publicity once a year as the site of the first mothers 
day service 
mrs dodds father was a civil war veteran who raised her and 
her five brothers alone after the death of his wife she decided 
fathers should be recognized too after hearing a sermon about 
mothers day 
spokane celebrated fathers day on june 19 1910 archer said 
kaufman said it was through mrs dodds continuing efforts that 
congress in 1972 57 years after official commemoration of 
mothers day declared the third sunday in june to be fathers day 
there had been six previous oneshot official observances 
including wilsons first proclamation

here are some quotes from political scientist 
norman ornstein 
 
on passage of the congressional pay raise 
its a zero issue its gone for all of ralph naders 
challenges and for all of the radio talk shows the public is not 
paying attention to this issue 
 
on a proposal by sen daniel moynihan dny to cut payroll 
taxes 
i dont think moynihan proposed it with the expectation that 
it would actually happen maybe im wrong but i think he proposed 
it for the shock value 
 
on special interest groups paying for travel by members of 
congress 
youre going to have much more luck slamming a guy for doing 
it on public expense than at the expense of private interests the 
public reaction is we dont give a damn if its taken out of 
special interests but dont take it out of our pockets

fear of the aids virus is so prevalent in the 
united states that onethird of the people who reported 
aidsrelated discrimination do not even have the disease an 
american civil liberties union report said saturday 
this study shows how extraordinarily persistent discrimination 
remains in this country even after science has proven there is no 
risk of casual transmission said nan d hunter principal author 
of the study 
the aclu study epidemic of fear will be presented at the 
sixth annual conference on aids in san francisco this week the 
study was compiled from information provided to the aclu by 260 
legal and advocacy groups across the country 
discrimination hurts the fight to control aids because many who 
have the disease refuse to be tested out of fear they will become 
victims of intolerance experts say 
about 13000 complaints of aids or hivrelated discrimination 
came into the 260 agencies between 1983 and 1988 hiv is the virus 
that causes aids 
discrimination reports increased by 50 percent during 1988 
following an 88 percent increase in 1987 the report said 
the study found that aidsrelated discrimination occurs 
nationwide cutting across lines of race gender ethnicity and 
sexual orientation even people who do not have the disease but 
associate with people who do are frequent targets of 
discrimination the report said 
most discrimination cases were based on fears of catching the 
disease racial prejudice or antihomosexual prejudice according 
to the study 
thirty percent of the people who reported discrimination were 
not hiv positive the study said twentyone percent of the 
discrimination complaints were from victims who thought they were 
targeted due to their risk of becoming hiv positive through a job 
lifestyle or other factors 
nine percent felt they were the victims of discrimination merely 
because of their proximity to someone who was hiv positive that 
closeness might be through a family relationship or by providing 
care or some type of services to an infected person the report 
said 
hiv discrimination is the no 1 obstacle to controlling the 
epidemic in this country because people are afraid to come forward 
and be tested said carisa cunningham a spokeswoman for the gay 
mens health crisis in new york we are not able to reach 
people because discrimination makes them afraid to come forward 
recommendations for fighting hivrelated discrimination include 
upgrading enforcement of antidiscrimination laws training lawyers 
in hivrelated issues and tightening the regulation of insurance 
practices 
consistent antidiscrimination laws are needed around the 
country because some states have strict laws while others have no 
laws the study said enforcement of the americans with 
disabilities act which takes effect in 1992 must become a top 
priority in the next decade ms hunter said 
the act bans discrimination against people with disabilities 
including people who are hiv positive and will make it possible to 
file discrimination charges in federal court 
the report was hailed by dr mervyn silverman american 
foundation for aids research president who said it points out how 
much still needs to be done in the area of aids education 
polls show that a significant percentage of americans know 
aids is spread through sex and drugs silverman said but at 
least 25 percent still believe it could be spread casually and when 
asked they said the best way to avoid getting the disease is to 
not be associated with anyone who has the disease

a selfdescribed former kgb intelligence chief 
said saturday that the spy agency still feared despite soviet 
reforms has too much power and should be closed down 
up until now no former kgb official here has publicly proposed 
that the agency be dismantled as a rule kgb officials who break 
with the agency flee abroad or disappear 
the kgb has too much political power and this way will remain 
a threat to democracy because it may be manipulated said oleg d 
kalugin who identified himself as a onetime major general in 
charge of foreign counterintelligence 
i would abolish the kgb as such said kalugin 55 who spoke 
with reporters after a speech to the democratic platform communist 
party members who are considering breaking with the party 
he displayed what he said were his kgb credentials but no one 
could be reached at the agency saturday to comment on kalugins 
remarks or verify his former title 
however cia spokesman mark mansfield in washington confirmed a 
man named oleg danilovich kalugin was at one time a kgb major 
general in charge of foreign counterintelligence 
we find it encouraging that an increasing number of soviet 
officials are speaking so candidly mansfield said we think 
there is some merit in this suggestion of disbanding the kgb he 
said 
the urbane welldressed kalugin who said he spent 12 years as 
an operative in the united states said the kgb supports soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
but the former official who said he was drummed out of the kgb 
this spring warned that criticism of the soviet president is 
increasing and that kgb chief vladimir a kryuchkov will turn 
with the tide 
kryuchkov appointed by gorbachev less than two years ago has 
been more open than any of his predecessors he and his top 
deputies have granted interviews to soviet and foreign media and a 
documentary film about the agency has been released 
the kgb has long been thought to be one of the organizations 
that brought gorbachev to power five years ago 
the kgb or committee on state security once terrorized soviet 
citizens and harassed foreigners it has said it is reorienting 
itself toward the struggle against organized crime and drug 
trafficking in cooperation with other foreign intelligence agencies 
foreign residents of moscow notice much less surveillance than 
in the past 
kalugin revealed no secrets during his appearance and did not 
discuss specific kgb cases but he said he still feared 
repercussions 
for the time being it is only publicity that can curb the 
kgb he told reporters 
the supreme soviet legislature formally oversees the agency but 
has done nothing to rein it in he said 
kalugin said kgb agents are still spreading disinformation about 
leaders of the political reform movement still tapping telephones 
still playing dirty tricks 
kalugin said legitimate domestic kgb operations should be placed 
under the interior ministry which is responsible for uniformed 
police intelligence services should be placed directly under the 
president and kgb border guards should be transferred to control 
of the customs service he said 
boris n yeltsin the radical reformer and new president of the 
russian federation has made a similar proposal to merge the kgb 
into a single investigations agency 
kalugin who speaks english well said he worked from 19581970 
as a kgb agent in the united states first as a radio moscow 
correspondent and then as a first secretary in the soviet embassy 
in washington 
he said he was certain during his tour in the united states that 
the cia had identified him as a spy but no action was taken 
against him

charge to protect pfannenstiels unborn children from suffering an 
ailment such as fetal alcohol syndrome 
but judge robert denhardt dismissed the complaint saying the 
state did not produce probable cause that her fetus had been 
injured 
the defense never presented witnesses winning the dismissal 
after the state closed its case 
pfannenstiels attorney mary elizabeth galvan said the birth 
in effect vindicates her client 
if prosecutors had their way shed have had this baby in 
jail she said

loggerhead sea turtles were threatened 
by crude oil creeping closer to shore from the crippled supertanker 
mega borg which spewed more goo into the gulf of mexico on 
saturday 
divers were planning a rescue mission to pluck about five 
loggerhead turtles from waters near the slicks leading edge said 
edward klima of the national oceanographic and atmospheric 
administration 
loggerhead turtles are a threatened species that can grow up to 
4 feet long and weigh up to 200 pounds he said 
he said if the turtles eat floating tar balls mistaking them 
for food they could die no other marine life appeared to be 
threatened he said 
about 46 million gallons of oil have spilled from the norwegian 
tanker since it was rocked by an explosion june 8 coast guard lt 
cmdr frank whipple said saturday the figure makes the mega borg 
spill the fifthworst in us history 
coast guard officials believe most of that oil all but 12000 
to 40000 gallons evaporated or burned in the inferno following 
the explosion 
the remaining slick is almost hanging out there whipple 
said the 45milelong slick of angolan crude oil was about 20 
miles from galveston 
coastal authorities braced for an onslaught of oil that could 
reach texas beaches as early as sunday but might not reach shore 
for several days said sharon christopherson of noaa 
where the oil slick might wash ashore was uncertain but the 
latest estimate identified an area between the west end of 
galveston island and high island as the most likely landfall 
about 1200 volunteers were being trained on how to clean up any 
oil reaching shore 
tony redding spokesman for smit america salvage inc said the 
fire aboard the 886foot tanker was declared extinguished saturday 
morning 
crews continued to douse the hull of the ship throughout the day 
to cool the buckled mega borg so workers could begin removing its 
cargo 
a small undetermined amount of oil leaked from the ship 
saturday whipple said 
geert koffeman project manager for smit america said the 
possibility of the vessel sinking was next to nil 
skimmers and booms were used on concentrated oil spots but most 
of the slick was too thin to skim 
texas general land office representatives meanwhile said they 
were pleased with an experiment started friday when oileating 
bacteria were dumped on a square acre of the slick 
visually the results of the microbes are very promising but 
we have no hard science im very optimistic said blanton moore 
of the land office 
he said it was difficult to tell from the air if the oil had 
been eaten by the bacteria or dissipated some other way adding 
that more microbes will likely be used later

a 2yearold girl suffering from leukemia 
was given a blood transfusion saturday by government order despite 
the religious objections of her parents 
the girls parents titos and eleni charalambous are jehovahs 
witnesses a fundamentalist christian sect that forbids blood 
transfusions 
they had snatched their daughter from a british hospital where 
she was being treated to avoid a blood transfusion and later 
defied a cypriot courts order to agree to a transfusion 
in an unprecedented move the government friday declare the 
child stephanie a ward of the state making the transfusion 
possible without the familys approval 
we had to rescue the child from death said helen soteriou 
a britishborn leukemia expert at nicosias evangelistria clinic 
she conducted the transfusion 
it was obvious we couldnt change their minds their 
convictions are too strong but we had a childs life at stake 
she added 
george marcoulis a cancer specialist at the private clinic 
told reporters there is a great improvement in the girls 
condition after an initial transfusion of one pint of blood 
her chances of survival are definitely in the range of 6080 
percent marcoulis said 
leukemia is an often fatal cancer of the blood 
health minister panikos papageorgiou himself a physician told 
cyprus television on saturday the improvement in stephanies 
condition justifies the action we took yesterday in making her a 
ward of the social welfare department 
he said the government would bear the costs of all further 
treatment for the child 
but stephanies father said i didnt see any improvement i 
still feel very unhappy that someone elses blood is in my 
daughters veins 
nobody can love my child as much as i do he had told 
reporters friday well do everything possible and sell all our 
belongings if necessary with the full support of the rest of my 
family to save stephanies life but we cannot agree to a blood 
transfusion he said 
cyprus president george vassiliou visited stephanie and said 
afterward the government respects religious beliefs but he said in 
this case intervention was necesary for the safety of the child 
stephanies parents snatched her from londons great ormond 
street hospital on monday to prevent her from being given a 
transfusion they returned to cyprus defying a british court order 
that the transfusion should go ahead 
the family went into hiding after a cypriot court ordered a 
transfusion police issued arrest warrants for the parents and 
launched a search to find them in a bid to save the girls life 
the warrants were withdrawn after stephanies parents took her 
to the evangelistria clinic on thursday 
but later that day the couple again took stephanie into hiding 
until police tracked them down friday and placed stephanie under 
state care 
daylong efforts by doctors at the clinic friday to persuade the 
parents to permit a transfusion proved futile

lithuania on saturday proposed that its parliament 
compromise with the kremlin and impose a moratorium on its 
declaration of independence officials said 
the proposal from the republics council of ministers appeared 
to coincide with a compromise offered tuesday by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and the official news agency tass said it 
could mark the beginning of the solution of all the socalled 
lithuanian problems 
also saturday soviet authorities began pumping natural gas to a 
fertilizer plant in lithuania partly easing the 2monthold 
blockade of fuel they imposed to pressure the baltic republic into 
renouncing its march 11 declaration of independence 
the lithuanian government suggested the declaration remain valid 
but its implementation be frozen while negotiations were under way 
with moscow said algis cekuolis a consultant for the baltic 
republic 
however cekuolis said it was unclear whether the compromise 
would have enough support to be passed by the republics 
legislature which will probably consider it monday 
it will be received in parliament by very strong opposition 
he predicted 
the lithuanian government under prime minister kazimiera 
prunskiene is considered far more disposed to compromise with the 
kremlin than the parliament which is led by president vytautas 
landsbergis and dominated by members of the proindependence 
sajudis popular front 
gorbachev proposed compromises tuesday in a meeting with the 
leaders of the three secessionist baltic states he told the 
national supreme soviet legislature earlier that day that if 
lithuania will suspend the implementation of this act of 
independence we may start to talk that means suspend its 
implementation at least for the duration of the talks 
saturdays proposal by the lithuanian council of ministers 
suggested exactly that government spokesmen said 
our act of independence would remain valid said council 
spokesman gentaras jatkonis but we are postponing the 
realization of it 
similar proposals have gone back and forth between the 
lithuanian capital of vilnius and moscow in telegrams and informal 
talks like a pingpong game for weeks but this is the first 
time its on an official level cekuolis said 
a spokesman for the lithuanian parliament aidas palubinskas 
said he was told on saturday by a pipeline dispatcher that natural 
gas was again flowing from the soviet union to the azotas 
fertilizer plant in the city of jonova 
the plant will be getting 35 million cubic meters daily 
palubinskas was told by dispatcher alexander mishikov 
restoration of the gas supply fulfilled a promise made to mrs 
prunskiene on wednesday by soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
that 15 percent of the republics daily natural gas supply would be 
restored 
politburo member yuri d maslyukov told a news conference in 
moscow on friday that the restoration of fuel to the lithuanian 
plant was a goodwill gesture from the kremlin and a reiteration 
of the soviet governments interest in speeding negotiations 
more than 26000 people have lost their jobs because of the 
kremlins blockade of all oil most natural gas and some raw 
materials 
palubinskas said that restoration of gas supplies to the azotas 
plant would mean 1600 employees could return to work by the end of 
this week 
at the beachfront resort of jurmala in latvia leaders of the 
popular fronts of latvia and estonia and the sajudis movement of 
lithuania opened a conference to discuss the future of their 
movements under democratically elected governments 
the delegates 50 from each of the proindependence movements 
condemned the economic sanctions against lithuania and discussed 
ways of increasing cooperation among the baltic states and with 
other soviet republics tass reported 
nobody has a right to demand either abrogation or halting the 
acts of independence tass quoted delegates as saying a 
retreat will harm the democratic movement

the us supreme court on saturday 
denied condemned killer john edward swindlers lastditch bid to 
avoid becoming arkansas first prisoner executed in 26 years 
the supreme court denied the stay request in a 72 ruling issued 
shortly before noon with justices william brennan and thurgood 
marshall dissenting said high court spokeswoman toni house 
swindler 46 is scheduled to be electrocuted at 9 pm monday 
for the 1976 murder of a fort smith police officer he would become 
the first person put to death in the state since 1964 
attorney gerald coleman said he told swindler of the high 
courts decision by telephone and that he took it like a man 
he didnt break up but he was disappointed coleman said 
he thanked me for calling him and doing what i could 
the lawyer said swindler had reached the end of the line in his 
appeals process theres nothing left to do i know of no other 
options he said 
attorneys for swindler appealed to the supreme court on friday 
after the 8th us circuit court of appeals in st louis turned 
down his request for a stay thursday the same day gov bill 
clinton rejected an application for executive clemency 
the lawyer said swindlers mood saturday was somber he hopes 
that this execution will make the people of arkansas think about 
capital punishment in general to think twice about executing 
anybody else on death row 
clinton was not immediately available for comment saturday 
spokesman mike gauldin said 
james lee of the state attorney generals office said 
prosecutors were ready to fight any further attempts to block 
swindlers execution 
there are nearly 72 hours between now and monday night and 
anything can happen lee said on saturday 
amnesty international which opposes capital punishment 
scheduled a 25minute silent protest vigil sunday night at the 
state capitol 
swindler was moved to a death cell adjacent to the death chamber 
at the cummins maximum security unit on friday he waived his 
option to choose his last meal and told officials they could 
destroy his personal belongings earlier in the week swindler 
waived his choice between electrocution or death by lethal 
injection 
swindler was convicted in 1978 of the sept 24 1976 death of 
fort smith patrolman randy basnett who was shot twice in the chest 
as he tried to arrest swindler who was wanted for murder in south 
carolina 
before the arkansas killing swindler killed gregg becknell 19 
and dorothy rhodes 18 after forcing them from their car on a 
junior college campus in columbia sc he told police he sodomized 
and beat the man and shot him then beat and shot the woman 
after exhausting his state appeals swindler filed a petition in 
federal court and in 1988 us district judge henry woods ruled 
that he had received a fair trial a year later the decision was 
upheld by the threejudge panel in st louis 
the last arkansas execution came in 1964 when charles franklin 
fields was electrocuted

university of pennsylvania veterinary 
students and staff handling sheep may have been exposed to a 
leukemia virus and 100 preschoolers were among visitors allowed to 
pet the research animals 
school officials asked 20 possibly exposed students and staff 
members to undergo blood tests and offered to make the tests 
available to the children and other visitors in a meeting with the 
parents friday night 
there is little chance anyone became infected by touching the 
lambs inoculated with the virus htlv1 known to cause adult tcell 
leukemia medical experts said 
if i were a parent of one the children i would not be 
worried said william blattner chief of the epidemiology section 
of the national cancer institute you cant spread this virus by 
petting a sheep 
the inoculated sheep were supposed to have been kept separate 
from a flock of about 150 other sheep at the new bolton center 
said aron b fisher a professor of physiology and the schools 
oversight committee chairman 
researcher jorge f ferrer allegedly violated school regulations 
by failing to quarantine the sheep inoculated between april 13 and 
april 24 officials said 
the exposure was discovered in early june ferrer was suspended 
pending an investigation expected to take about a week efforts by 
the associated press to reach ferrer for comment by telephone 
werent immediately successful 
the inoculated lambs are believed to have been among sheep that 
were castrated and had their tails bobbed by eight veterinary 
students and 12 staff members sometime before may 16 officials 
said 
about 100 students from the private kennett square cooperative 
preschool were allowed to pet the lambs when they visited the 
center on may 16 and may 22 school officials said thirty adult 
visitors also could have come in contact with the sheep 
the htlv1 virus linked to the sometimes fatal blood cancer is 
communicated through blood mothers milk and sexual intercourse 
penn scientists said 
its a very minimal risk said barry cooperman university 
vice provost for research 
permission for the viral experiment by ferrer a physician and 
professor of microbiology at penns school of veterinary medicine 
hinged on the sheep remaining isolated fisher said 
edwin j andrews dean of the veterinary school said the 
university discovered that the flock included inoculated sheep on 
may 24 after another researcher asked if the animals had been used 
in other experiments 
officials established that humans had come in contact with the 
sheep early this month 
andrews said the likelihood of true infection was extremely

environment ministers from across europe 
agreed saturday to work at cleaning up heavy pollution in east bloc 
nations 
the problems that have been described were horrendous and far 
beyond our forecasts environment commissioner carlo ripa di 
meana of the european community said 
he spoke after ministers from seven eastern european nations 
reported on pollution in their countries at a oneday meeting in 
dublin with ministers of the european community 
the ministers from 19 nations planned an attack on industrial 
contamination of the air water and land that has built up over 
decades 
they signed a communique setting out ideas to tackle nuclear and 
toxic waste acid rain and water pollution in the emerging 
democracies of eastern europe 
it stressed that protection of the environment was one of the 
most urgent political priorities 
the agreement commits poland the soviet union hungary 
yugoslavia east germany czechoslovakia bulgaria and the european 
community members to look at ways of effective pollution monitoring 
and curbing harmful practices that poison the environment 
the nations also called for the establishment of a new european 
environment agency open to countries outside the european 
community to help ease the way for the cleanup 
the ministers heard a catalogue of pollution misery in eastern 
europe 
environment minister josef vavrousek of czechoslovakia 
complaining of pollution in his nation said life expectancy in his 
nation was 67 years five years lower than the average for western 
europe 
vavrousek said that until the late 1950s his countrys life 
expectancy rate was increasing to about 70 years 
since then the rate had fallen in some areas of worst 
pollution he said that in some heavily polluted areas like 
northern bohemia the life expectancy is 10 years below the western 
european average 
the ministers said one of the leading causes of pollution in 
eastern europe was the massive emissions of sulphur dioxide from 
coalburning power stations 
east germany has announced plans to reduce its acid rain levels 
by switching from lignite to hard coal at power stations and to 
use more oil and gas 
that countrys environment minister karl steinberg said the 
oldest and dirtiest power stations would be closed and clean coal 
technology would be introduced 
his country is aiming to cut its energy consumption by up to 25 
percent over the next decade and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 
at least 20 percent

three paintings at the nelsonatkins 
museum of art were found with deep scratches blamed on a 
disgruntled employee 
scratches were found in the paint of two 16thcentury german 
works and in an 1880 painting by french impressionist edouard

even recently done

man painted by lucas cranach the younger in 1538 and betrothal

no visitors he said only staff were present 
these things take but a few seconds to do bailey said 
its a sick unhappy disturbed person 
the three scratched works were removed from display the german 
works on exhibit in rooms separate from the manet suffered the 
worst damage 
we believe it was the same person who attacked the manet 
bailey said at least i believe it was it was a quick sudden 
movement like done in anger 
no arrests were made in the case and no damage estimate was 
available the value of the paintings would not be released for 
security reasons ms austin said

thousands of protesters rallied saturday in support 
of dozens of families living in outdoor camps since being evicted 
from their apartments 
the demonstration was the latest in a growing uproar over a 
housing shortage in paris and a war on squatters declared by the 
city in march 
the 78yearold abbe pierre frances premier champion of the 
needy led the march from the place de la republique to chatelet in 
the heart of paris 
since may 2 48 families have been living in tents at the place 
de la reunion in eastern paris after being evicted from the 
apartments where they had been squatters 
nine other families evicted from buildings that are to be 
renovated were camping at the foot of the famous montmartre 
basilica sacre coeur and at least six families were camping in 
front of a local administrative building in eastern paris 
they all said they will remain in their tent camps until the 
city provides them with alternative housing 
paris and all large cities will likely be very beautiful 
tomorrow housing only people with means abbe pierre told the 
crowd at the rally but they will be cursed by hundreds of 
ghettos surrounding them nests of despair hate crime broken 
families 
police estimated the protesters at about 3000 organizers said 
there were tens of thousands present 
the city declared its offensive on squatters on march 15 when 
the traditional winter moratorium on evictions ended 
city officials said squatting had reached unacceptable 
proportions and sent riot police in to start clearing buildings 
evictions have temporarily stopped with the growing protest 
movement 
critics say the city is trying to drive the poor out of town as 
property values steadily rise amid a wave of real estate 
speculation recently condemned by president francois mitterrand a 
socialist 
premier michel rocard last week appointed a mediator between the 
protesters and the city to try to resolve the dispute

the french researcher who discovered the aids virus 
demanded saturday that the united states repeal its ban on granting 
entry to people testing positive for the virus 
the ban has prompted dozens of international organizations and 
agencies to call for a boycott of an international aids meeting in 
san francisco this week france and switzerland have said they will 
not send official delegations to the meeting 
the french researcher luc montagnier said he would attend the 
sixth international conference on aids but he said it would be the 
last conference on american soil if the united states failed to 
repeal the ban 
the american restrictions are completely unacceptable and it 
is being said out loud that we are going only to save this 
conference montagnier said in a recording for canal sante a 
cable television channel for health professionals 
but it is clear that the next american conference which is 
to take place in boston will not take place if the american law is 
not changed he said 
the boston conference on acquired immune deficiency syndrome is 
scheduled for 1992 
montagnier led the french research team at the pasteur institute 
which discovered the aids virus 
under a law passed in 1987 by the us congress infection with 
the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids was 
added to the list of contagious diseases for which foreigners can 
be barred from entering the country 
aids is a deadly disease that attacks the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and 
cancers a person can carry the aids virus without having the 
disease and its symptoms though infection in almost all cases 
leads to the disease

conference committee 
the social security plan could make it even more difficult to 
fashion a compromise 
some gop lawmakers plan to offer a resolution this week in the 
house that would instruct the conferees to go along with an 
important if largely unrelated provision that the senate added 
to its child care bill 
that provision would raise the annual limit on outside earnings 
that social security recipients over the age of 65 can have while 
still receiving their full government checks 
supporters say the change would provide a needed break for the 
working elderly but opponents call it a 3 billion giveaway to 
senior citizens that would in effect be charged to the cost of 
childrens programs 
they say it has no business in the muchdebated childcare bills 
were going to be dispensing money through the earnings test 
that could be used by middle class and working people for child 
care said rep tom downey dny a sponsor of the child care 
bill and opponent of the social security provision 
it comes right out of the pockets of working people and into 
the pockets of the elderly downey said 
advocates of increasing the social security earnings ceiling say 
the limit effectively increases the tax on recipients over the age 
of 65 
they claim a majority of house members as cosponsors on a 
separate bill to lift the earnings limit all together 
thus far however that bill has remained firmly bottled up in 
the house ways and means committee where chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill opposes any such change 
because of the earnings test seniors are being forced out of 
the work force and into the rocking chair said rep j dennis 
hastert rill 
rep hank brown a republican senate candidate in colorado was 
expected to offer a non binding motion this week to instruct the 
house conferees to go along with that senate provision 
the motion most likely would be approved downey said 
the senate which has no rule barring unrelated amendments on 
bills added the provision on a 1000 vote last year after it was 
offered by finance chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
it would raise the amount of earnings for people aged 65 to 69 
that are exempt from any reduction to 10560 a 1200 increase 
social security payments for recipients earning more than that 
would be reduced by 1 for every 4 earned up to 15560 in 
earnings instead of the current 1 for every 3 earned 
most of the conference committee deliberations have been devoted 
to other sections of the complicated and conflicting child care 
bills the house version has been estimated to cost 27 billion 
over five years while the more modest senate version has been 
estimated at 10 billion over four years 
jurisdictional disputes among members of congress have plagued 
the bill 
the house version passed march 29 provides tax credits that 
could be used by working families to pay for child care it would 
also provide money to epand head start preschool services and 
establish a new program encouraging schoolbased before and after 
school child care 
the senate version passed june 12 1989 would provide tax 
credits and create a separate grant program for child care 
opponents say its central grant program would require annual 
appropriations and thus is vulnerable to political whim while the 
house version locks in key portions by making them automatically 
renewing entitlement programs 
rostenkowski has resisted the notion of increasing the earnings 
limits for social security recipients and is concerned about the 
cost estimated by his committee staff at 3 billion 
the potential generational conflict comes at a time when the 
ways and means committee has just issued a lengthy study of the 
impact of federal entitlement programs that suggests children as a 
group have suffered economically over the last decade while the 
aged have fared better 
the report said the poverty rate for the aged fell from 157 
percent in 1980 to 12 percent in 1988 while the poverty rate for 
children rose from 183 percent in 1980 to 197 percent in 1988

said honduran president rafael callejas

european community as cochairs 
in a world of redefined hegemonies the united states is again 
making its claim this central america is our turf and there is 
no doubt about it one regional development expert said of the 
proposal he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the summits opening was delayed almost an hour until halftime 
in the world cup soccer match between costa rica and brazil 
diplomats international bankers development experts bureaucrats 
and reporters huddled around televisions in this colonial city 27

the region

there are ample possibilities for economic cooperation in the 
central america 
energy roads communications these are issues which deserve 
a regional approach he said in an interview from the banks 
washington headquarters

although negotiations are under way in el salvador and 
guatemala peace is still not at hand nicaragua is still in the 
delicate process of transition from a decade of revolutionary

a soviet pilot who was a hero of the chernobyl 
nuclear disaster was in critical condition saturday with a lung 
infection said officials at the hospital where he recently 
underwent a bone marrow transplant for leukemia 
anatoly grishchenko 53 who had been in stable condition after 
the april 27 transplant developed a fever and breathing 
difficulties late thursday and doctors at the fred hutchinson 
cancer research center placed him on a respirator early friday 
center spokeswoman susan edmonds said 
grishchenko was sedated and on a respirator and his doctors 
really dont feel there will be a recovery in the next 24 
hours edmonds said saturday 
while doctors still hoped for improvement there had been none 
in the previous 24 hours and that is usually a sign that things 
are not going to go well she said 
if grishchenko survives the night doctors will assess his case 
sunday when they likely will decide whether to continue use of the 
respirator she said 
grishchenkos wife galina was at her husbands side edmonds 
said 
grishchenkos leukemia was detected late last year he made four 
flights in five days through hot radioactive gases to dump sand and 
wet concrete on the chernobyl nuclear plant 
the plant about 80 miles north of kiev in the soviet republic 
of the ukraine exploded and burned april 26 1986 at least 31 
people died in the disaster 
he underwent the transplant in hopes that healthy marrow could 
restore normal bloodcell production 
the problem is a hardtotreat lung infection he had before 
coming to the hutchinson center edmonds said doctors had tried to 
eliminate it with antibiotics but the infection continued in his 
right lung 
after waiting until the transplant appeared successful doctors 
on tuesday performed exploratory lung surgery to identify and 
remove the source of the infection 
the surgery appeared to go well but grishchenkos condition 
began deteriorating late thursday edmonds said 
it was not known if his worsening condition was related to the 
surgery she said adding that he will continue to receive 
antibiotics 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev praised grishchenko in a 
recent letter as a national hero and a brave man who didnt spare 
his life in the line of duty the letter was delivered while 
gorbachev was touring parts of minnesota and california earlier 
this month after the summit meeting in washington dc 
grishchenko arrived in seattle from the soviet union on april 11 
a lot of people are praying for him said cap parlier of 
mesa ariz who arranged the bone marrow transplant the 
lighthelicopter testing and evaluation director for mcdonnell 
douglas corp is a friend of grishchenko and has closely followed 
his treatment

us officials will have to talk with 
representatives of the country that supplies drugs through thailand 
to reduce the flow thai officials told administration 
representatives friday 
the thai officials did not publicly name the country they were 
referring to but burma is known to be the biggest supplier of 
drugs shipped through thailand the united states has poor 
relations with burmas military government which it has sharply 
criticized for the countrys record on human rights 
at the national press club thai prime minister chatichai 
choonhavan referred a question on drugs to his minister in charge 
of narcotics korn dabbaransi 
the supply itself does not originate in thailand korn said 
so if you want to talk to the supply side well have to 
include a third country if we discuss between us and the 
united states only it will never work and the united states will 
have to realize that you will also have to do your own homework 
with the country in question before we can ever hope to reach 
any fruitful ultimate target 
the state department has criticized corrupt thai officials for 
letting drugs flow through their country 
thailand is significant as the primary route for southeast 
asian heroin bound for the international market it said in its 
most recent report on narcotics control in march 
heroin is refined in thailand but in much smaller quantities 
than that produced in refineries on the burmese and to a somewhat 
lesser degree lao sides of the border 
according to the state departments figures thailand will 
produce this year about 50 tons of opium the raw material for 
heroin while burma is expected to produce 2780 tons 
in a speech to the club chatichai said narcotics trafficking 
transcends national boundaries 
we must direct our joint effort at both the supply and demand 
side of the problem he added

president francois mitterrand in a letter released 
friday said the european community has improperly allowed english 
to become its dominant administrative language at the expense of 
french 
france was ready to help ec bureaucrats acquire the linguistic 
competence needed to perform their mission mitterrand wrote in a 
letter to jacques delors the frenchman who is president of the 
european commission 
several conservative members of britains parliament criticized 
mitterrands letter 
the mans dotty sir nicholas fairbairn said french is 
the language of privacy and english is the language of 
communication 
it might not be a bad idea if president mitterrand took some 
english lessons preferably from mrs thatcher said another 
member of parliament neil hamilton 
mitterrand said using french increasingly as an official ec 
language was a top priority of his government 
today a tendency exists in certain sectors of the commission 
to convene meetings of experts who are asked to work only in 
english he wrote 
mitterrand said many ec documents including contract offers and 
work documents were issued only in english despite a treaty 
calling for multilingualism 
such practices are not acceptable and france will continue to 
oppose them he wrote france is ready to put at the 
commissions disposition the means of enabling its employees to 
acquire the linguistic competence needed to perform their mission

environmentalists told senior advisers to 
president bush on friday that the timber industry has grossly 
exaggerated the economic impact of proposals to save the 
northwests northern spotted owl from extinction 
the white house officials who heard the environmentalists story 
friday on thursday heard from the timber industry 
the fish and wildlife service is expected to declare the 
northern spotted owl a threatened species next week a move that 
likely will require vast tracts of land to be set aside for habitat 
protection and result in severe reductions in timber harvests 
larry tuttle director of the wilderness society of oregon said 
the environmentalists were very encouraged by the tone of the 
white house meeting on friday 
it gave us a chance to debunk some of the numbers that the 
timber industry has been using to support their case clearly they 
are using worst case numbers and in some cases worse than that 
he said 
a panel of government scientists led by forest service biologist 
jack ward thomas said in april that 84 million acres of forests 
must be set aside to ensure the owl will survive across its range 
of oregon washington and california 
forest service chief f dale robertson said his agency intends 
to institute most of the thomas plan the agency earlier projected 
if the plan was adopted in its entirety harvest levels would be 
cut nearly in half in the region resulting in the direct loss of 
more than 28000 jobs by the end of the decade 
tuttle said however that the jobloss figures include 
unemployment due to causes other than the spotted owl he said 
7000 jobs are likely to be lost as a result of continued 
automation 7000 are likely to be lost as a result of changes in 
10year forest management plans already under way and another 7000 
are likely to be lost because private lands have been overcut to 
the point less timber will be available

the government can proceed with the nations 
largestever money laundering case a judge ruled friday despite 
claims by holders of frozen bank accounts they were unaware their 
dollars were drugtainted 
us district judge lenore nesbitt refused defense requests to 
dismiss the forfeiture case that rose out of operation polar cap a 
nationwide crackdown on profits allegedly growing from trafficking 
by colombias medellin drug cartel 
she said prosecutors have established minimal probable cause to 
believe about 11 million in 88 florida bank accounts is connected 
to drug profits earned by drug smugglers 
but account holders have a right to be concerned about the 
governments complaint she said in her 21page ruling 
although designed to deprive those associated with the drug 
trade of their illicit gains and tools of the trade forfeiture is 
nevertheless a draconian remedy she wrote the government has 
alleged only skeletal facts in the complaint that would support any 
legal theory of forfeiture 
the accounts were among 658 seized in 23 states in april in an 
unprecedented crackdown against money laundering us attorney 
general richard thornburgh said agents had for the first time 
traced money made in drug sales on the nations streets directly to 
drug traffickers in colombia 
the government later released most of the accounts after 
conceding they belonged to wealthy individuals and corporations 
that traded pesos for dollars on colombias unofficial currency 
exchange market the cash was then wired to us banks 
lawyers for the account holders asked nesbitt last week to 
dismiss the case saying their clients are legitimate businessmen 
who had no idea the dollars they bought were dumped on the black 
market by the cartel 
but the judge said the account holders must prove their innocent 
ownership in court she promised a speedy trial and scheduled a 
status hearing for july 6 
my client and i will continue to fight this gross miscarriage 
of justice said fred schwartz an attorney representing 
colombian businessman marc levy 
schwartz said levy is a legitimate businessman who has nothing 
to do with drugs and was only buying dollars to pay for his 
childrens education in the united states

holyoke college 
the twins are mirrorimage amy is lefthanded and wears 
glasses anne is righthanded and needs no correction on her 
vision like many twins they finish each others sentences and 
dont understand why people find them unusual 
at college we just were biology majors amy frary said we 
knew we wanted to do something with plants we just picked it out 
of the blue 
four years ago the twins graduated from hampshire regional high 
school with grade point averages better than 97 percent amy edged 
out anne for valedictorian by a fraction of a point but the twins 
said there was no acrimony 
were not like that anne frary said 
for the science grant stein wrote one recommendation pointing 
out that there were two frarys applying 
i happened to learn inadvertently that nsf sent their two 
folders to different panel groups so they were in fact evaluated 
separately she said they stand on their own merits 
at mount holyoke the twins graduated with a 390 grade average 
which made them both summa cum laude 
stein said she has advised the twins to get separate mentors at 
graduate school so they can begin to diverge the next stage in 
their life they have to go out and find jobs and the job market is 
such that the chances are thats when theyll split 
although they look very similar the twins are not impossible to 
tell apart 
it was easy for me because i have a set of identical twin 
girls also who are now 28 stein said 
amy frary said name mixups are the only thing that annoys her 
about being a twin 
it annoys me that people who we went to grade school with all 
12 years still cant tell us apart she said

west germany intends to reduce 
emissions of carbon dioxide 25 percent within 15 years to combat 
global warming known as the greenhouse effect a government 
official said friday 
scientists say the odorless colorless gas could cause higher 
temperatures by collecting on the outer edges of the earths 
atmosphere and trapping heat within that process could produce 
changes in the worlds climate 
frankfurter allgemeine newspaper said that highly industrialized 
west germany with about 61 million people inhabiting an area 
roughly the size of oregon now releases 716 million tons of 
carbon dioxide a year into the atmosphere 
reducing the emissions by 25 percent by the year 2005 would mean 
a cut of nearly 180 million tons annually it said 
a cabinet committee group was set up wednesday to work out 
details for the project said uwe fritche he is a member of the 
enquete commission a federal panel of experts that evaluates 
policy options on climate change 
fritche said officials are also studying ways of drastically 
cutting carbon dioxide emissions in east germany as quickly as 
possible after the two countries are united 
east germany which heavily depends on brown coal as an energy 
source has the highest per capita emission rate in the world with 
224 tons per year per person the newspaper report said west 
germanys is about half that level 
carbon dioxide is released during the burning of fossil fuels 
its already clear that energy efficiency will be the main 
means to achieve the goal of cutting emissions 25 percent 
fritche told the associated press in a telephone interview 
he said the government is considering taxing emissions to 
encourage cutbacks in the industrial and private use of 
carbondioxide producing fuels including heating oil 
in britain prime minister margaret thatcher has committed her 
country to a 30 percent reduction in its carbon dioxide emissions 
by the year 2005

owner

said thursday thats the extraordinary thing about the 
rediscovery of it 
cole is thought to have painted the lush tropical depiction of 
paradise in 1827 it features mountains towering trees foliage 
and wildlife lit in bright jewellike colors 
art historians knew of the painting from preliminary drawings 
descriptions and an engraving of it used as the frontispiece of an 
1831 edition of the bible

its no bull ravioli makers are seeing red 
now that their 8foot plastic mascot rudolpho has been stolen 
anyone seen riding or leading a plastic bull should be 
identified a police dispatcher told squad cars in the field on 
thursday 
police issued the alert for rudolpho the molded fiberglas bull 
who had graced the roof of the twostory homestead ravioli co 
until sometime wednesday 
the big bovine beast was a familiar site to highway commuters 
who passed the building in the citys south of market street 
district ravioli workers often dressed up rudolpho for the 
holidays 
its not coit tower but it was certainly a landmark for some 
people said andrew kubersky president of homestead ravioli 
coit tower is an important san francisco landmark 
i miss him kubersky said 
the company inherited the bull when it moved to the building 11 
years ago rudolpho was placed on the roof by the meat packing firm 
that earlier had occupied the building 
kubersky said bull is actually a misnomer for the 
genderneutral rudolpho 
we call him a bull but hes missing some parts kubersky

million people in six counties 
authorities will use the photographs to assess irrigation levels 
over an extended period of time skrove said 
this isnt an instance where were going to be spying on 
people skrove said were going to be spying on water use 
primarily in broad categories such as parks golf courses 
cemeteries or even residential neighborhoods but certainly not 
individual homes 
where overwatering is detected water district officials expect 
to contact local water districts subdivision developers or 
operators of parks golf courses or cemeteries to encourage 
conservation measures such as landscaping that requires less water 
skrove said 
there wont be any new photographs only pictures taken since 
october 1988 by landsat satellites which orbit 450 miles above 
earths surface said tracy walklet vice president of terramar 
resource information services inc 
the mountain view calif computer software and systems company 
will buy enhance and analyze the photos under an 80000 contract 
approved tuesday by the water districts board of directors 
to the best of our knowledge this is the first time this 
technology is going to be applied to urban area for gauging water 
conservation potential skrove said 
terramar will use the photos to determine the amount of 
irrigated land and the intensity of watering in the districts 
5200squaremile service area which includes parts of los 
angeles ventura orange san diego riverside and san bernardino 
counties 
based on the amount of reflected light vegetation will appear 
in different shades of red with the most lush heavily watered 
vegetation appearing bright red 
what we want to do is categorize the types of vegetation we 
have in southern california and how much water is being used for 
them skrove said then in the future we will be able to tailor

department to investigate an annual fundraising event in some 
public schools that students have nicknamed slave day because 
classmates buy one another as servants 
students at upper lake elementary school in rural lake county 
also call the day seventhgraders rule because the younger

statements by ron raetz an upper lake high school teacher and 
elementary school board member that he had bought a high 
school senior as part of the event at his school each year one 
year raetz told a local newspaper he bought a mexican kid 
dressed him up in a big sombrero a serape and hung a green card 
around his neck it was all in good clean fun

richard wagner never was content just to write 
operas he longed to control every detail of how and where they 
were performed 
in 1850 immersed in a project called siegfrieds tod he 
vowed that this time he would do it his way 
i am toying with the boldest of plans the composer wrote to 
a friend from zurich switzerland where he was living i would 
have a theater erected here on the spot made of planks and 
give three performances free of course in the space of a week 
after which the theater would then be demolished 
twentysix years later siegfrieds tod had blossomed into 
four operas a 17hour epic titled der ring des nibelungen and 
wagner had designed and built his own wooden theater an acoustical 
gem with a covered orchestra pit in the town of bayreuth germany 
there the world premiere unfolded on aug 13 14 16 and 17 
1876 wagner had dreamed of presenting the four operas on 
successive days but he realized that would put impossible burdens 
on the singers since then most productions have added one more 
day off so a typical ring cycle takes six days from start to 
finish 
now thanks to television american audiences can savor wagners 
marathon masterpiece the way he conceived it beginning tonight 
the public broadcasing service will present the metropolitan 
operas production on four consecutive nights 
its a 5 million undertaking that should please purists and win 
new admirers for wagners tale of greed love and redemption set in 
a fantastical world populated by mermaids dwarfs giants and gods 
the mets ring has been hailed by some critics for its 
faithful approach to wagners original intentions and lambasted by 
others as stodgy and lacking a modern point of view 
some productions nowadays put wotan bruennhilde amp co into time 
tunnels nuclear holocausts or 19thcentury factories the met 
sticks to wagners original settings which are bizarre enough 
without updating 
modern stage technology helps in the first bayreuth production 
the three rhinemaidens climbed into an oversize bathing machine for 
the opening scene of das rheingold at the bottom of the rhine 
river at the met water is suggested by lighting and a scrim 
stretched across the stage 
the finale in which a castle collapses the river overflows and 
the home of the gods goes up in flames looks awesome thanks to the 
trickery of producer otto schenk set designer guenther 
schneidersiemssen and lighting director gil wechsler 
thanks to tactful editing the tv version directed by brian 
large actually offers some advantages over the live performances 
first and foremost are the subtitles which help the listener 
through those long monologues for which wagner is notorious host 
f murray abraham introduces each episode and provides useful plot 
summaries 
in addition crucial stage effects that tended to go awry in the 
theater work perfectly on tv the anvil that siegfried breaks in 
two with his magic sword sometimes crumpled too soon in the opera 
house but on tv it splits right on cue 
and singers who sounded vocally stressed in live performance 
come off better because the videotape editors were able to combine 
the best moments of several performances from the last two seasons 
this is especially true of tenor siegfried jerusalem who looks 
great acts superbly but sings erratically in the grueling role of 
siegfried 
hildegard behrens grace and emotional involvement make her 
bruennhilde memorable though her voice is not in the league of 
heroic sopranos like kirsten flagstad and birgit nilsson 
one thing tv audiences definitely wont see is the accident in 
which miss behrens was hit on the head by a beam that collapsed too 
soon at the end of a goetterdaemmerung this spring she was not 
seriously hurt but missed several later performances 
other standouts include basses james morris a handsome 
richvoiced wotan and matti salminen a thundering malevolent 
hagen baritone ekkehard wlaschiha and tenor heinz zednik as the 
deliciously repellent dwarf brothers alberich and mime and mezzo 
christa ludwig past her vocal prime but still compelling as both 
fricka and waltraute 
as the incestuous brotherandsister siegmund and sieglinde who 
enter the story tuesday in die walkuere tenor gary lakes and 
soprano jessye norman sound beautiful but they are far too amply 
proportioned to look or act the parts of impetuous young lovers 
especially in closeup 
a couple of minor vocal notes on wednesday in act two of 
siegfried we get to hear but not see the lovely dawn upshaw 
chirping away as the forest bird on thursday in the prologue to 
goetterdaemmerung pay attention to the third norn shes a 
young soprano named andrea gruber whos destined for bigger and

the call for riots came from larry kramer one of the founders 
of the aids coalition to unleash power or act up 
it is the most militant aids organization and kramer may be its 
most militant member 
in articles published in gay newspapers around the country 
kramer wrote every human being who wants to end the aids 
epidemic must be in san francisco screaming yelling furiously 
angry protesting at this stupid conference we must riot 
act up is a grassroots group without leaders or a hierarchy it 
was founded in new york in 1987 and now has perhaps 2000 members 
there twentyfive chapters have sprung up across the country some 
with several hundred members 
of the conference organizers kramer said my feeling is these 
are the same idiots putting on this conference who have bumbled the 
epidemic for 10 years and made mistake after mistake 
if you really want my gut feeling he said in an interview 
last week i think the war against aids has been lost 
san francisco police say they expect demonstrations at the 
convention but no violence 
outside of mr kramer we dont know of anybody talking riot 
or violence said sgt jerome senkir were hoping for a 
peaceful conference i think at this point thats going to happen 
as kramer pointed out in his articles the aids meeting which 
begins wednesday in san francisco provides an unparalleled 
opportunity for activists to deliver their message 
some 12000 scientists and 1800 members of the news media are 
registered to attend the conference was established as an annual 
forum for presentation of the latest scientific reports on aids 
but increasingly is becoming the target of protests 
last year in montreal the opening of the conference was delayed 
for an hour when 200 activists seized he podium to demand better 
access to aids drugs and an end to discrimination peaceful 
demonstrations continued later outside the convention center 
larger and more disruptive demonstrations are expected this year 
some protesters will remain outside the meeting boycotting the 
conference to protest a policy that allows the us immigration and 
naturalization service to bar foreigners infected with the aids 
virus 
the new york chapter of act up will not boycott the meeting at 
least 50 of its members have registered and they promise to carry 
their protests inside 
protests are liable to occur at the most visible events or at 
anything where a bush administration official or a member of the 
executive committee is at the podium said peter staley of act up 
new york 
the executive committee is a group of scientists that sets 
policy for the aids clinical trials group the governments program 
for testing new aids drugs it is run by the national institutes of 
health 
there will be two major messages well be trying to deliver 
there said staley first off is the rage our community is 
feeling now with the ins secondly he said we want to deliver 
the message to the scientific community that they have failed thus 
far in reducing aids to a chronic manageable disease from the 
death sentence that it is now 
act up has become adept at organizing angry demonstrations its 
most recent protest occurred at the national institutes of health 
a thousand activists gathered there in may to demand increases in 
federal aids research eightytwo were arrested 
even before the demonstration the national institutes of health 
was so upset by act ups criticisms that it took the unusual step 
of sending science reporters a detailed 30page response 
like it or not weve got a debate going about the 
governments aids research effort said staley during the may 
demonstration there was debate in the corridors of the nih he 
said arguments broke out as to whether we were right or wrong 
at the same time act up has worked quietly behind the scenes to 
help change government policy its members now are consulted by the 
nih and the food and drug administration 
we seem to have access to anyone we want said charles 
franchino a member of the act ups treatment and data committee 
when we meet with government people theres the specter of 3000 
people standing behind us and thats whats gotten us in the 
door 
kramers call for riots has divided activists it was criticized 
by gay and lesbian groups in san francisco 
san francisco is not an angry town like new york is kramer 
said 
one group there he noted plans a quiet candlelight protest 
but militants elsewhere have put the city on notice 
i do know that the city is terrified that there really are 
going to be riots and i suspect it will be very much a police 
state for those days he said 
after montreal there was a lot of hope this year there is a 
lot of despair because that hope has simply not appeared 
drugs continued to be tested slowly in a rigid system kramer 
said and for many people with aids it already is too late 
were talking about another savings and loan scandal he 
said were all going to wake up and its going to cost 500 
billion 
new york state has just reported that its annual expenses for 
aids care topped 1 billion for the first time last year in 10 
years researchers have projected that one in 24 people in new york 
city will have aids a new aids infection occurs in the united 
states every minute 
the figures are grotesque and no ones paying attention to 
them kramer said 
in a letter to activists who opposed his call to riot kramer 
wrote you are free not to riot and you are free to criticize my 
call to riot 
and we are all free to die

cross creek belongs to the wind and the rain to the sun and 
the seasons to the cosmic secrecy of seed and beyond to all 
time 
marjorie kinnan rawlings 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
marjorie kinnan rawlings with her 
endearing portraits of rural florida life and people belongs to 
her adopted state 
now efforts are being made including a federal lawsuit to 
return all the manuscripts of the late pulitzer prizewinning 
author to the university of florida library as instructed in her 
will 
rawlings widower 89yearold norton baskin recently filed 
suit against the seajay society a nonprofit literary group in 
columbia sc the group has one of rawlings unpublished novels 
some short stories and 81 letters that he wants returned 
rawlings is well known for her depictions of florida 
crackers her 1939 pulitzer prizewinning novel the 
yearling the tale of a boy and his deer in the florida 
wilderness and cross creek stories of the alachua county 
community where she lived from 1928 until her death in 1953 she 
wrote in the characterspeaking vernacular that mark twain had 
utilized so well 
when she told her housekeeper martha about winning the 
pulitzer the woman replied well aint that nice bet nobody 
else at cross creek got one 
her home at cross creek is a state museum preserved as it was 
when rawlings did her writing there 
rawlings was born in washington dc in 1896 and educated in 
wisconsin she worked as a journalist in new york state but gave 
it up in 1928 to live and write on the 72acre citrus orchard she 
bought in cross creek it was the same year ernest hemingway 
arrived in key west 
her first husband charles rawlings was also a journalist they 
divorced and she met baskin a hotel owner several years later 
they married in 1941 and had a second home in st augustine where 
she died of a brain hemmorrage 
rawlings life and work were portrayed by mary steenburgen in 
the critically acclaimed movie cross creek in which baskin 
played a minor role 
the state regents granted the university permission to either 
join baskins suit or file suit on its own to recover the 
manuscripts 
a decision will be made in the next few weeks according to 
barbara wingo associate legal counsel for the university on how 
the university plans to proceed we will use what we consider the 
best way to get the manuscripts back and have them published she 
said 
the unpublished manuscripts baskin is seeking to recover include 
numerous short works from the 1920s and a 1928 novel blood of my 
blood the items were stored for 26 years at the massachusetts 
home of julia scribner bigham rawlings longtime friend and 
executor of her literary works 
under provisions of rawlings will the university has the right 
to any published and unpublished manuscripts and literary property 
wingo said 
bighams heirs found the works in 1987 and the seajay society 
obtained the works for 12500 
steve matthews a member of the seajay society said the works 
were given to bigham by rawlings and were not part of the rawlings 
estate 
a lawsuit is being contemplated wingo said because extensive 
negotiations with the society have failed to produce any results 
they are not going to give them up she said 
the society is dedicated to enhancing awareness of and 
appreciation for unduly neglected aspects of southern writers 
and southern culture matthews said 
some of the rawlings works held by the society are from as 
early as 1914 and were probably written for a creative writing 
class others were written at the start of her literary career in 
van hornesville in upstate new york 
baskin said his wifes writings are important to understanding 
her progress as a writer they should be returned to the university 
of florida he said 
blood of my blood its a very personal thing its 
marjories life baskin said 
rawlings submitted the manuscript to the atlantic monthly press 
in a competition it is a story about the tense relationship 
between the author and her mother 
the seajay society wanted to publish blood of my blood 
through the university of florida press but was denied permission 
by baskin matthews said 
the university of florida library is eager to get the 
manuscripts said sam gowan associate director for collection 
management retrieving the rawlings manuscripts he said is 
important to both the library and to scholars of the author 
that would allow researchers to find most of her works under one 
roof 
i think what is really most important is that the library 
feels it is the depository of record he said

the ferris wheel at an amusement park turns 
riderless in the wind and the eyes of children stare unknowingly 
at a cameraman whose free hand holds a geiger counter registering 
off the scale 
visitors to the photo exhibit of igor kostin the first soviet 
photographer on the scene of the april 26 1986 explosion at the 
chernobyl power plant are greeted by the images of burn victims 
rescue workers and the contaminated rubble it is a testament to 
the worlds worst nuclear accident 
there are the melancholic strains of mozart bach and beethoven 
and the darkness of a black tunnel representing the fallen cooling 
tower at the plant which was among kostins first sights when he 
arrived there 11 hours after the explosion and fire 
this is definitely not art said kostin a 53yearold 
industrial designer turned photographer it cant be a piece of 
art because it was such a terrible thing its a historical tragedy 
for our people and a warning for other people that this could 
happen anywhere 
kostin was in baltimore to kick off the us tour of his 
exhibit chernobyl not to be forgotten 
about 100 black and white and color photos are arranged in 
chronological order beginning with the destroyed building of 
reactor 4 the arrival of rescue workers and nuclear power 
officials and the cleanup operation and ending with more recent 
photos of the chernobyl trial protests in kiev residents who 
either have refused to leave the 18mile danger zone or are 
awaiting government relocation and deformed animals and 
contaminated crops in the area 
but next to the devastating scenes of hospital patients 
abandoned homes and the silent amusement park in the nearby village 
of pripyat are kostins testimony that life continues photos of a 
woman giving birth to the first postchernobyl baby a new housing 
settlement built for evacuees and a man standing defiantly outside 
his contaminated home with a sign that reads attention 
countrymen and soldiers do not destroy this house we live here 
the exhibit ends with a brief photocopied statement from kostin 
when i think back it seems as if it were yesterday i can hear 
the noise of the helicopter and i can see the people who had to 
leave their homes taking with them only a cat or a kitchen pot as 
they fled from the danger then i think did it all really happen 
when people look at the photographs each person sees 
something different but i want them to see what i saw there four 
years ago and since he said the reaction of all people has 
been the same the sorrow is the same and they have the same 
tears 
kostin who lives in kiev about 60 miles from the plant 
continues to return to the danger zone despite the health risk 
i went there the first time because i just had to see with my 
own eyes and i took my camera so other people could see said 
kostin a photographer with the soviet news agency novosti i go 
back now because it is a magnet drawing me someone has to continue 
to go back into the affected area to show the world that there are 
still people living there to show that it never should have 
happened and that it must never happen again ive already been 
exposed thats my job now 
according to official soviet figures 31 people were killed in 
the explosion and fire at the ukrainian plant although a soviet 
newspaper has speculated the death toll could be as high as 250 
the soviet government has said it plans to continue to relocate 
villagers from the contaminated area but there is little money for 
housing 
kostin said the government has been cooperative in allowing him 
to show the photographs and to travel with the exhibit 
five years ago i couldnt even think about this he said 
im happy to live at a time when i can show what ive done and 
can tell what i have to tell 
but when it comes to telling his story kostin said he prefers 
to let the photographs stand alone 
if i have anything more to say it would be this i would like 
to give a gift to the american people and to the people of the 
world an armful of uncontaminated flowers from a clean field in 
the ukraine i wish i could say it didnt happen 
the exhibit which already has toured four cities in italy and 
austria will be in baltimore through midjune susu erca of 
imago the italian firm sponsoring the exhibit said negotiations 
are continuing with boston and portland ore but the next stop on 
the tour has not been confirmed depending on its reception in the 
united states the exhibit is expected to be on tour for a year 
erca said 
proceeds from the exhibit which has a 1 entry fee will help 
establish the igor kostin fund for children of chernobyl erca 
said the fund will go toward medical supplies for hospitals within 
the danger zone

when marvin young was dutifully doing 
his economics homework two years ago at the university of southern 
california he thought that after graduation he would settle down 
to the 9to5 desk job grind 
but somewhere along the line he became young mc 
today the rapper not only has an economics degree he also has a 
topselling album and single a pair of music awards and a 
promotion deal with pepsi 
i didnt intend to get into the music business the way that i 
did it was just luck it was kind of fate that it happened 
he said i intended to go to college and get my degree then get 
a regular job and use that money to put out my records and then see 
what happened from there 
in the past year young mc has won an american music award for 
best new rap artist and a grammy award for best rap performance 
with the song bust a move 
his album stone cold rhymin has gone double platinum 
selling over 2 million copies he also wrote the hit songs wild 
thing and funky cold medina for fellow rapper tone loc 
and he recently made a deal with pepsi to promote cool cans 
stylized versions of the soft drinks traditional can over the 
summer 
not bad for someone who is just 22 however young mc hasnt 
settled down in the music business just yet he wants to use his 
bachelors degree in economics to go even further 
going out now and being young mc and all the records and 
the awards and whatever the case may be its good now for the way 
im thinking but in the future it also is a building block for me 
to be a competent executive in the business he said 
dressed in a black running suit before his recent worcester 
appearance with popduo milli vanilli young mc said his music is 
purposely lighter than some other rap songs that have drawn 
criticism for controversial lyrics 
bust a move is a case in point the song follows the 
humorous path of boy meets girl almost 
its like ok a guy sees a girl and wants to talk to that 
girl dont be shy go up to her bust a move its just that 
simple instead of getting deep and graphic and all of that to me 
its unnecessary 
other rappers most notaby groups such as nwa public enemy 
and 2 live crew have come under fire for music that is fueled by 
racial social and sexual issues 
its not the subject matter its not the fact that people 
will get on a record and say the government is unjust or black 
people are being mistreated because if you say it like that its 
not that offensive young said 
but when you swear or when you degrade other races or 
degrade women or get violent and talk about killing people thats 
what is found offensive 
young mc said he keeps controversy out of his lyrics because 
of his fans and he wants to establish an audience before he starts 
voicing his opinions the thing about it to me is that you go 
at your own pace he said you dont beat people over the head 
with the things you want to say and you also dont say it in a way 
to challenge or offend anybody 
young mc was born in london but grew up in queens ny by the 
time he reached high school he was already writing the songs that 
would eventually make up about half of stone cold rhymin 
then two years ago a single and somewhat unconventional 
audition led matt dike and mike ross to sign young mc to their 
delicious vinyl record label 
i just rapped for them over the phone and they signed me it 
all happened really fast he said 
since that fateful phone call young mc has become known as 
something of a prodigy in the music business he wrote wild 
thing for tone loc in 35 minutes and funky cold medina in 
under an hour bust a move took a mere hourandahalf and it 
remained on billboard magazines hot 100 singles chart for more 
than 40 weeks and all of the writing took place while he was still 
at usc 
see thats what happens when youre in college and youre 
hungry and youre sick of professors and classes he joked 
despite his cinderellalike launch in the business young mc 
is not about to turn into a pumpkin and fade into obscurity he 
says the same about his medium rap is here to stay regardless of 
the critics who believe it is a passing musical fad 
there is no way its going to die out its a young peoples 
music its just like how folk music was in the 60s he said 
you can get a lot more thoughts across with more words and 
theres a lot more words to a rap song than there is to a singing 
song 
now the pressure is on to make more hit records 
but the fame hasnt gone to his head if anything its made him 
hungrier 
when people talk to me and say youve made it or something 
like that i dont feel like ive made it two or three albums down 
the line if i still have the same appeal i have now then thats 
what im talking about he said 
you have a lot of artists come out and they have great albums 
for one year then two or three years down the line you dont know 
where they are 
in the meantime young mc is looking with amazement at his 
sudden success he never thought hed achieve all this when he was 
sitting at his dormroom desk pondering figures and formulas 
i was an economics major and now im rapping for a living he 
said with a laugh it doesnt seem to follow

republican bob smith has won three house races 
stressing his opposition to higher taxes the new hampshire 
congressman isnt about to drop a winning strategy just because 
george bush is wavering 
if the president changes course ill disagree with him 
pointblank says smith hes counting on the no new taxes 
theme to sweep him into the senate this year 
rep bill schuette wears a keepthepledge button as he 
campaigns for the gop senate nomination in michigan presidential 
backpedaling on taxes doesnt bother him as long as the debate 
keeps generating publicity for his own views 
it is in the newspapers all across the state taxes are being 
discussed in washington where does bill schuette stand foursquare 
against raising taxes schuette said frankly it helps me 
sound and fury over flagburning have overwhelmed the nations 
political debate in the past week but the average citizen is more 
likely to be affected by a quiet series of budget talks in 
washington that are likely to produce higher taxes bushs famous 
campaign promise notwithstanding 
even as bush edges away from his read my lips campaign 
rhetoric republican candidates who have staked their careers on 
the no new taxes pledge are embracing it as tightly as ever 
publicly they wont concede anything even that bush has 
softened his position they say hes merely done what was necessary 
to open a dialogue with congress on the budget 
last week a business lobbyist at a lunch with rep hank brown 
another gop senate candidate said higher taxes on gas tobacco and 
liquor appear to be a done deal among the budget negotiators 
am i wrong the lobbyist asked hopefully 
you surely dont believe the president of the united states is 
going to break his word brown replied lightly 
but bush entered into discussions with congress by saying there 
were no preconditions on the talks and most analysts expect tax 
increases to be part of any agreement presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater confirmed the impression last week when he 
accidentally referred to the sessions as tax negotiations later 
correcting the word tax to budget 
the best thing republicans can hope for right now is for the 
administration to support some nontax taxes like user fees sin 
taxes possibly even an increase in the income tax rate on the 
very wealthiest said analyst stuart rothenberg editor of the 
political report 
brown running for an open colorado seat agrees the dilemma may 
be finessed that way but he and other notax candidates dont 
see much difference between general tax hikes and the narrower 
measures that seem to be on the table any tax increase is anathema 
to them 
their resistance is understandable given the enormous success 
republicans have had with campaigns against taxandspend 
democrats the issue continues to look strong 
in a gallup poll last month for example 36 percent of those 
questioned said theyd be less likely to vote for a senator or 
congressman who had supported a tax increase the figure was 42 
percent among republicans 
california voters approval this month of a doubled gas tax at 
first was interpreted as a sign that the tax revolt is over but 
now analysts say it signals only that middleclass voters are 
willing to pay more for something they want in this case better 
roads 
bushs sudden veer away from his hardline antitax rhetoric 
caught republican candidates unawares and none were more exposed 
than the eight house members giving up their seats to run for the 
senate 
but the shift at the top has not cost them a potent issue as 
they had feared many like schuette are discovering that it 
carries unexpected dividends 
rep lynn martin rill challenging democratic sen paul 
simon said her surprise at bushs move was later overcome by my 
delight it certainly allowed me to make my position clear which 
is always nice it gave me advantages that at the first blush i 
didnt think were going to be there 
bushs shift constantly comes up on the campaign trail says 
rep larry craig ridaho i simply say that i have never voted 
for a tax increase in the 10 years i have served in the us house 
i will not vote for a tax increase now i am disappointed that my 
president is willing at least to begin some consideration of 
possible tax increases 
in the event bush agrees to a budget package that raises taxes 
there will be no shortage of candidates to remind him of his broken 
promise if people vote for higher taxes says smith so be it 
but they didnt vote for it in 1988 that was the theme of the 
campaign

trading in belgiums bourse never has 
been highprofile but a dispute over control of marketmoving 
information here has grabbed attention of brokers and regulators 
far beyond the borders 
the stock exchange is battling a group of belgian and 
international news outlets over who has the right to release news 
first 
the news group has accused the exchange of seeking to monopolize 
the news violating the european communitys fair competition rules 
and press freedom the group includes reuters ltd the largest 
financial information reporting service 
the exchange has said it wants to level the playing field for 
market participants by becoming a clearinghouse for 
marketsensitive corporate news under a stock market reform bill 
now under government review 
presently companies release news to the exchange and the press 
at the same time under the reform only the exchange would get the 
news then release it to investors and traders through a datbase to 
which the media could subscribe 
although some say this is strictly a domestic fight others fear 
it could have more profound implications for trading elsewhere 
especially in view of other events that suggest the world is moving 
to 24hour global trading 
the 12nation european community is scrutinizing the belgian 
dispute with special concern because it plans a communitywide 
trading system after 1992 the system presumably would have uniform 
rules for disclosure of information that could affect stock prices 
the debate over the issue already has led the belgian government 
to review the stock market reform plan 
we are taking this very seriously said bernard snoy an 
aide to finance minister philippe maystadt 
reuters and several belgian media groups have complained to the 
government the stock market is misinterpreting the bill they argue 
that if the bourse gets to handle corporate news before the media 
this will violate ec laws on clarity in corporate matters and fair 
competition 
they say the stock market cannot get company news to the public 
quickly they also say it cant be done without risking insider 
trading abuses in which stock market insiders can act on corporate 
news before others can 
this could institutionalize insider trading said herman 
smedts manager of electronic information at the financieel 
ekonomische tijd a financial daily 
but bourse officials say their method avoids insider trading by 
giving the bourse a chance to suspend dealings in a company stock 
before the information is released 
also they say by releasing news after trading has closed they 
can assure all investors will see reports in the media the next day 
and can act on it simultaneously when trading reopens 
we are mainly concerned that information gets to all people at 
the same time said jean peterbroeck head of the brussels stock 
market commission a panel intended to make sure the exchange 
functions in an orderly manner 
there is also money at stake 
the bourse a nonprofit outfit has created bdb its own 
database service the media groups say that by channeling 
information to bdb the exchange gets a monopoly on news and gets 
to finance the computer trading system the brussels bourse bought 
in 1988 
its partially true we are out to make money said bdb 
general manager jeanpierre monmart 
but we never had the idea of monopolizing market news 
organizing yes monopolizing no 
the media groups fearful of losing customers point to the new 
york stock exchange as an example of how the stock market could set 
its news policy 
the nyse requires companies to release their news to the 
exchange and to reuters and the dow jones co the worlds two key 
financial news groups simultaneously the paris and frankfurt 
exchanges have similar rules 
for their part the brussels bourse points to the london 
international stock exchange which gets a first crack at corporate 
news 
brussels also says the media have ulterior motives 
reuters which already receives instant data on stock prices 
volumes and some price bids wants access to even more exchange 
information 
they could only want that to mount their own trading system 
to supplant conventional exchanges said one bourse official who 
asked not to be named 
reuters says it only wants the same type of information other 
markets provide it and the other media groups proposed creating a 
cooperative owned by information vendors to replace bdb 
the two alternatives one requiring simultaneous disclosure 
the other giving a stock exchange precedence are likely to be 
debated as exchanges across the ec work to establish a 
communitywide stock trading system 
sources said the ec federation of stock exchanges has agreed in 
principle that their price information program for europe pipe 
would resemble the london stock exchange media groups have said 
they will challenge that

dean rusk and nikita khrushchev two leaders 
of the cold war now have something else in common sons who are 
offering assessments of their fathers roles in both war and peace 
richard rusk in what he calls my attempt to know my aging 
father interviewed the former secretary of state for long hours 
with a tape recorder rolling 
sergei khrushchev describing himself at one point as a 
witness to my fathers meditations chronicled the last seven 
years in the life of the soviet leader who was driven from power in 
1964 
as i saw it by dean rusk as told to richard rusk will be 
published june 25 by ww norton amp company 
khrushchev on khrushchev an inside account of the man and his 
era by sergei khrushchev is scheduled for june 28 publication by 
little brown and company 
nikita khrushchev was a coal miners son who rose through the 
ranks of the soviet bureaucracy holding power for 11 years as 
communist party chief and six years as premier before being 
deposed he died in 1971 
rusk 81 lives in athens ga he was secretary of state from 
1961 to 1969 and was as his son says an architect of a war that 
killed 58000 americans and nearly a million vietnamese 
he was with president kennedy at the summit in vienna in june 
1961 when in his words khrushchev set out to intimidate this 
new young president of the united states 
sergei khrushchevs view is different the main thing i recall 
happening at vienna was that the two men got acquainted father 
returned to moscow after the summit with a very high opinion of 
kennedy 
rusk encountered khrushchev again after going to moscow in july 
1963 to initial a limited atomic test ban treaty at the soviet 
premiers villa on the black sea they batted a badminton bird back 
and forth with no net and no lines on the floor 
after his downfall khrushchev was all but forgotten in the 
soviet union pictured his son recalls as a dimwitted hooligan 
cast upon the throne by fate only recently has the 
rehabilitation of his image begun 
rusk although he held office longer than any secretary of state 
since cordell hull and retired to an honored professorial chair in 
his native georgia had his detractors too 
historian arthur m schlesinger a kennedy white house aide 
found him the perfect numbertwo man a baffling leader 
who had authority but not command as richard rusk sees it 
schlesinger was suggesting that rusk wasnt smart enough for the 
job 
staying on in the johnson administration after kennedys death 
the state department veteran became increasingly a target for 
opponents of the vietnamese war 
the young richard rusk a student at cornell found himself 
caught between love for my father and the growing horror of 
vietnam unwilling to volunteer and unwilling to embarrass his 
father by joining the antiwar movement 
in a taperecorded session two decades later he pressed rusk on 
the point and found him unprepared for admitting that 
thousands of american lives and hundreds of thousands of 
vietnamese might have been lost in vain 
for the elder rusk there were no doubts because of this 
nations commitments i had a duty to perform to try to prevent 
north vietnam from overrunning south vietnam by force that was my 
job and i tried to do it 
the taciturn rusk and the voluble khrushchev both at first 
resisted the idea of writing their memoirs 
all we wanted to do was to get him involved in some kind of 
project writes sergei khrushchev father didnt respond to our 
first suggestions sometimes he laughed them off 
when he did agree to tape record his memoirs soviet authorities 
of the time resisted publication but the material was published 
widely abroad as sergei khrushchevs own book neared publication 
he was seeking to have a russian edition of his fathers memoirs 
published so as to restore his good name 
rusk vowed when he took office in 1961 that he would never write 
his memoirs saying he would leave it to the historians 
in a preface to richard rusks book however he tells how his 
son came home to georgia after many years in alaska years spent 
i now realize attempting to understand and make peace with the 
events of his youth and of my public service 
he could not do this could not reforge the broken chain 
without me dean rusk writes 
reforging the chain richard rusk interviewed family critics 
and friends as well as his father 
at every stage of dean rusks life youth public servant 
retired statesman were signs of mortality he writes but 
mainly i found affirmation of the goodness in my dad

as if to prove that things cant go down 
forever most of the news coming from the junk bond market lately 
has been upbeat 
the 200 billion market that paid a steep price for the debt 
excesses of the 1980s has staged a significant rally in recent 
months by some measures junk bonds have outperformed 
investmentgrade corporate bonds and treasury bonds 
the market really took off last week on news that kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co would inject 17 billion into rjr nabisco 
the news eased fears about rjrs ability to continue to meet debt 
payments when the interest rate on 6 billion of bonds a 
bellwether for the market are reset beginning next year 
fundamentally things have stopped getting worse says 
howard marks who manages about 1 billion in high yield funds at 
trust company of the west in los angeles 
to be sure the market has a long way to go to regain anything 
like its former vigor it remains virtually shut to new issues 
volume has dwindled to just 382 million so far this year from more 
than 12 billion in the same period last year 
the drying up of new issues has clipped some wings on wall 
street merrill lynch last week reassigned the two coheads of its 
merchant banking department raymond minella and jeffrey berenson 
they led the firms expansion into junk bonds but their 
department has little to underwrite these days and is stuck with 
hundreds of millions of dollars in illiquid securities and 
supposedly temporary bridge loans that cant be refinanced 
defaults also expected to hit another record this year were 
underscored this past week when developer donald trump missed a 
payment due to holders of junk bonds used to finance his trump 
castle casino in atlantic city nj those bonds slumped in value 
afterward 
nonetheless much of the bad news about defaults already has 
been discounted 
for example prices on more than 800 million of junk bonds 
issued by southland corp rose sharply late last week even as the 
company which operates the 7eleven chain missed an interest 
payment 
bondholders hadnt expected southland to make the payment says 
kingman penniman an analyst with mccarthy crisanti amp maffei but 
they were cheered by the companys enhanced offer to exchange the 
bonds for cash and stock he said whats more the bonds were 
trading at less than a quarter of their face value at that level 
they have value even if southland liquidates he says 
bankers say new players such as equity investors and revived 
demand from longtime junk buyers have given the market fresh 
strength in one sign of that strength the market two weeks ago 
readily absorbed the sale of 50 million in junk bonds from the 
resolution trust co the federal agency liquidating the holdings 
of failed savings and loans 
basically the market is looking for paper said john 
crotty head of new issues and sales at first boston corp 
crotty says the junk market generates nearly 25 billion in 
interest payments a year and investors are reinvesting much of 
that money those flows have helped junk bonds recover from the 
depths reached late last year and early this year 
indeed first bostons index of 400 junk issues showed a total 
return of 546 percent from march through may tenyear us 
treasury bonds returned just 132 percent in that period according 
to the firms index 
some institutions are hoping the market gets a further boost 
from a new auction system set to start next month for junk bonds 
and lightly traded equities 
new york securities auction corp plans to conduct weekly 
auctions of securities primarily junk bonds over bloomberg 
financial systems electronic screen service 
joel greenblatt the wall street investor who is starting the 
service says the lack of ready price information on junk bonds 
deters investors he hopes to counter that by getting institutions 
to display their offerings on a screen and allowing others to bid 
for the bonds 
one of the hallmarks of an efficient market is open 
information on buyers and sellers says marks of trust company of 
the west which has enrolled as a member in the auction system he 
said the system may increase efficiency and it may increase 
liquidity

it hasnt become a police matter and so far 
there seems to have been little impact on family and social 
affairs but there has been a mysterious disappearance of 
middleage men from the work force 
statistically speaking theyve left little trace which amounts 
to a truly astounding occurrence since were not talking about a 
few guys vanishing here and there 
a few disappearances are to be expected considering the stress 
factor these days but this vanishing act involves 30000 a month 
its been going on since last october and that means the total now 
is well over 200000 
those are significant numbers nothing like it has been seen 
before and making it more mysterious is the absence of clues 
these men havent been laid off for example because they havent 
shown up in jobless insurance claims 
theyve just gone from the rolls leaving statisticians with the 
puzzle of figuring out where they went if the disappearance 
occurred in just one or two months it might be dismissed as a 
statistical aberration but not this 
economists at donaldson lufkin amp jenrette a securities firm 
have been among those seeking an explanation but while they have 
an interesting and plausible theory they havent yet been able to 
prove it 
among their findings is that labor force participation by men 
aged 45 years to 54 years peaked last october with 918 percent of 
them working and that the percentage had fallen steadily to reacy 
901 percent in may 
those unaccustomed to percentages such as these might find such 
a decline of no special concern even insignificant it is anything 
but the economists say it is extremely significant unprecedented 
in the entire economic expansion that began eight years ago 
they checked the age group one tier below in the 35 years to 44 
years category the phenomenon couldnt be seen among these younger 
men in fact job participation in that group was decidedly stable 
rather than unstable 
then they checked the age tier just above where men aged 55 
years to 64 years are counted while they did find participation by 
this group had declined quite a bit since the 1950s that decline 
leveled off in 1986 
in short since last october when the middleage men began 
disappearing there was no comparable phenomenon to be found among 
their older or younger brethren 
when so many of similar profile disappear if only 
statistically it suggests something sinister this becomes 
especially so when they leave no clues had filed for unemployment 
insurance for instance you might assume they had been laid off 
and then you might limit your probing to why 
but they didnt file for insurance or at least the statistics 
suggest they did not initial claims for such insurance have moved 
in a narrow range since last fall no sharp runup no big bulges 
at all 
sinister indeed two hundred thousand men in the prime of life 
vanish from the labor force without a whimper no complaints from 
their wives and children no obvious explanation in the statistics 
no inquiries 
no but there is a possible explanation and it is anything but 
sinister 
they retired 
that is the tentative conclusion of the economists who explain 
having chosen early retirement or settlement packages many of 
these men may be ineligible to file for unemployment insurance 
thus their job disappears without any claim having been filed 
the puzzling statistics could indicate they say that early 
retirement programs now are being directed at middle managers 
rather than senior level managers 
lost from the job statistics perhaps but not from life they 
may not labor but they do live in fact if they really did settle 
for a bundle of money to get lost theyre probably living the good 
life

approaching the midway point of 1990 wall 
street analysts see many blessings to count in the performance of 
the stock and bond markets so far this year 
stocks have reached record highs in recent weeks and bond 
prices have also rallied as interest rates declined 
worries about inflation have ebbed as well but a slowdown in 
the pace of economic growth doesnt appear in the eyes of many 
forecasters to have brought business to the brink of any severe 
economywide recession 
along with whatever enthusiasm those developments may have 
engendered many market commentaries and predictions these days 
express a generous measure of relief 
since new years most observers agree the markets have tiptoed 
with remarkable agility through a minefield of potentially serious 
hazards 
already fading into memory from the early weeks of the year are 
a severe break in japanese stock prices some of the losses from 
which have recently been recouped and the failure of drexel 
burnham lambert inc the titan of the junkbond market 
more recently investors have had to grapple with worries about 
credit problems facing a diverse list of borrowers and lenders 
ranging from developer donald trump to the moneymarket mutual 
funds 
even the muchdiscussed threat of a credit crunch appears to 
have been staved off for the time being at least 
whatever happens during the summer and beyond many analysts 
say the federal reserve has kept some ammunition in reserve to use 
against any signs of developing economic trouble 
so far they note the fed has held off on any moves to a more 
stimulative credit policy as growth has weakened 
the economy is slowing but a recession can probably be 
avoided said jack lavery at merrill lynch 
we believe the data to be reported during the weeks ahead will 
show economic activity to be weak enough and inflation tame enough 
to spark another fed easing within the next month 
hopes of that sort helped inspire a solid advance in the stock 
market during the past week the dow jones average of 30 
industrials climbed 7351 points to 293589 surpassing on friday 
its previous closing peak of 293519 reached on june 4 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 181 to 
19786 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 668 to 46755 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 284 at 36403 
volume on the big board averaged 15529 million shares a day 
against 16846 million the week before 
as much as they may like the chances for lower interest rates 
during the second half of the year many analysts are leery of 
committing themselves too much in that direction 
they havent forgotten the surprise that hit optimistic 
forecasters over the early months of 1990 when interest rates 
jumped along with borrowing costs in the financial centers of japan 
and west germany 
suresh bhirud an analyst at oppenheimer amp co argues 
interest rates are most likely to remain in a narrow range at 
this point 
with a slowdown in the economy he says the budget deficit is 
likely to increase therefore although interest rates may not rise 
substantially we doubt they will come down much until there is a 
meaningful reduction in the deficit 
also he says real interest rates are still high in germany 
and japan which will keep pressure on us rates for some time

gravley said the ban takes effect at 1201 am monday on 
regularly scheduled buses charter service is not affected the

indicated 22 percent of its passengers smoke compared to 29 
percent of the general public 
the company carried 225 million passengers last year and has 
been carrying about 75 percent of that passenger load since a 
strike by drivers began march 2

the ban most buses stop about every two hours for meals or 
intermediate rest stops and we hope that will provide the relief 
that the smokers need he said

manhattans south street seaport was a frenetic 
commercial center in the 19th century but fell victim to 
technological leaps in moving goods that made its wharves and 
merchants obsolete 
the message has not been lost on another business landmark 
nearby the cavernous new york stock exchange 
this past week the big board took steps ultimately designed to 
avoid the same fate as the seaport now a trendy singles spot of 
bars and restaurants where oceangoing clippers are just quaint 
relics from the precivil war days 
nyse chairman john phelan confirmed plans to ease into 
computerized afterhours trading which could lead to full 24hour 
trading by the year 2000 the nyse also released a study of stock 
volatility aimed at showing that the nations biggest securities 
market is sensitive to the anxieties of all investors 
although details of the afterhours trading plan must still be 
worked out the aim is to recover business lost to competing 
exchanges and companies that are trading nyse stocks on their own 
when the nyse is closed 
there is some volume going overseas and wed like to capture 
some of that volume back phelan said 
the big board remains by far the preeminent us place to buy 
and sell stocks but in recent years a growing number of investors 
who want to do business in the offhours are going to london or 
tokyo a reflection of what appears to be an inexorable march 
toward a nonstop global marketplace 
other investors have found it more efficient to execute trades 
via technologically advanced nyse rivals in the united states the 
overthecounter nasdaq system for example uses computers to 
match buyers and sellers and is expanding into offhours trading 
this september when it will open at 330 am eastern time 
by contrast the nyse has clung to an oldfashioned group of 
marketmaking specialists although they use computers to make 
the flow of trading more efficient the specialist system still 
hinges on humantohuman contact on the big board floor which 
opens weekdays at 930 am and closes at 4 pm 
the nyses traditional reluctance to expand hours has played a 
partial role in its eroding share of business it handled only 692 
percent of all trades in listed stocks last year a record low 
exchange earnings fell to 629 million last year a 40 percent 
drop from the 1045 million earned a year earlier 
the nyse is taking a look at afterhours trading basically 
because of competitive pressures said joseph hardiman chairman 
of the national association of securities dealers which runs the 
nasdaq system theyre trying to be responsive by telling issuers 
they will be able to provide something 
the nyses other signal of responsiveness to customers came 
earlier in the week when its market volatility and investor 
confidence panel disclosed findings of a study into causes of 
stockprice volatility 
the most important recommendation was the use of trading halts 
during times of market stress but many securities professionals 
remain opposed to such an idea arguing it could worsen panicky 
selling by investors trying to get out of a market before it closed 
some suggested trading halts also could have the ironic side 
effect of driving business to less restrictive markets abroad 
in other business and economic news this past week 
more signals emerged suggesting a slowing economy retail and 
wholesale prices rose modestly in may easing pressure on 
inflation the government reported it also said the trade deficit 
shrank dramatically in april reflecting lower demand for imported 
oil and autos 
a takeover specialist ensnared in the ivan boesky insider 
trading scandal received a 2month prison term one of the mildest 
punishments meted out in a fouryearold crackdown on securities 
fraud martin a siegel who allegedly took suitcases of cash from 
boesky in return for insider tips could have received 10 years in 
prison but he cooperated with prosecutors to implicate others 
standard amp poors corp a leading debtrating agency lowered 
its opinion of creditworthiness of ford motor co and chrysler 
corp reflecting growing weakness in the automotive industry the 
rating downgrade means ford and chrysler will find it more costly 
to borrow money 
casino developer donald trump missed a payment on junk bonds 
used to finance one of his atlantic city resorts the most visible 
signal yet of the trouble dogging his real estate empire but 
another prominent personality with the initials dt basked in more 
positive publicity luring hordes of moviegoers as the hollywood 
blockbuster dick tracy opened around the country

for chrysler 
under the agreement about half of hondas primo dealer network

would sell for about 33300 and the wrangler for about 23800

financially strapped philadelphia received 
another blow friday when standard amp poors corp lowered its 
ratings on 13 billion in city bonds citing chronic deficit 
operations 
city financial director betsy reveal who called the news 
disappointing but not unexpected said the decision could cost 
the city 30 million in future years in extra interest 
the citys general obligation bonds were downgraded two rating 
notches from bbbplus to bbb the company also said 236 million in 
bonds issued by the philadelphia redevelopment authority and 
philadelphia parking authority were downgraded to bbb 
the rating is one level above what standard amp poors considers 
the minimum investment grade that offers a high level of 
security the last time the citys bond rating dipped below 
investment grade was in 1976 
it clearly will increase our costs for future borrowing 
reveal said 
standard amp poors pointed to this fiscal years city deficit 
estimated to be 60 million when the year ends june 30 as a sign 
of chronic fiscal imbalance 
the creditrating company added that the citys 21 billion 
budget scheduled to go into affect july 1 does not bode well for 
restoration of fiscal stability
