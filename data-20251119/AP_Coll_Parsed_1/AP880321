fourteenyearold tiffany salzer got an a on her book report 
without opening the book she watched the movie instead 
it only took me three hours to watch the movie and it would 
have taken me 12 hours to read the book said the ninthgrader 
from ventura calif 
her father jim owner of salzers video store and a board 
member of the video softwares dealers association is familiar with 
the situation 
its a problem he said in a telephone interview a kid 
essentially can rent a classic movie and do a book report from it 
kids are taking shortcuts 
videotape retailers across the nation say many teenagers 
children of the television generation are taking study guides that 
summarize literature one step further and turning to videotapes for 
help with homework renting rather than reading 
tiffany said her teachers sometimes show movies in class but 
only after students presumably have read the corresponding 
literature she said she watched clan of the cave bear the 
night before a report on the book was due 
the teachers say the movie is different sometimes it is but 
students dont really care she said its better to get a c 
than an f 
at parents requests art marra pulled to kill a mockingbird 
from the shelves at his hto video store in suburban pittsburgh 
after students were assigned to read the book 
since then marra periodically has refused to rent certain 
videotapes to youths because he learned the corresponding books 
were homework assignments 
were a communityoriented shop we try to give the community 
any cooperation we can marra said 
mike petraglia noticed young people make sporadic runs on 
certain films at his videoovideo store in pittsburgh he said a 
popular videotape among teens is dirty dancing but when 
assignments dictate he cant find enough copies of death of a 
salesman treasure island grapes of wrath and billy 
budd 
gone with the wind has been picking up a little bit i think 
its bookrelated he said 
students always have searched for the easier way and the video 
scholar is just a variation of the cliff notes customer said scott 
treibitz spokesman for the american federation of teachers based 
in washington dc 
for 29 years students have used cliff notes to provide 
summaries and analysis of books and sales of the study guides 
still are growing said doug lincoln spokesman for cliff notes 
inc of lincoln neb 
the problem now is with the access of video cassette recorders 
and with the access of video stores treibitz said 
lincoln said cliff notes may produce its own videotapes but he 
declined to discuss details 
the generation that is in elementary school now theyre 
certainly in the video age lincoln said i would have to say 
the use of video will probably only increase 
teachers are increasingly using videotapes in the classroom and 
as a supplement the tapes are helpful said judi boren spokeswoman 
for the north allegheny county school district in suburban 
pittsburgh 
you cant use the video as a cliff note kind of crutch ms 
boren said theres a saying i read the book i dont need to 
see the movie if you make some comparisons maybe you need to do 
both 
a teacher can give a lecture on the grand canyon niagara 
falls space exploration treibitz said a video not only gives 
that same material but shows the visuals to reinforce that 
material 
it cant replace reading it cant replace writing and there 
are times it cant replace the lecture he said

more than 400 people have been arrested or charged 
in murders rapes looting and acts of rioting in a southern soviet 
city divided by ethnic tensions the prosecutors office reported 
monday 
the communist party daily pravda said the territorial dispute 
between the soviet republics of armenia and azerbaijan that sparked 
the unrest in sumgait was caused by the clear antisocialist 
spirit of a campaign waged by militant armenian leaders 
in signs of continuing tension in the region 7000 people 
reportedly staged a protest march in the armenian capital yerevan 
and the official tass news agency and soviet television condemned 
two of the armenians by name 
the armenians are demanding the union of the predominantly 
armenian region of nagornokarabakh part of azerbaijan since 1923 
with armenia 
on feb 28 after repeated demonstrations calling for union with 
armenia in nagornokarabakh and yerevan rioting broke out in 
sumgait an industrial city in azerbaijan 
official soviet accounts have said the victims were of various 
nationalities but armenian sources said armenians living in 
sumgait were sought out and killed by azeris members of the 
predominantly ethnic group in azerbaijan 
moscowbased journalists have been barred from traveling to the 
caucasus since unrest there began and have been unable to verify 
reports 
the soviet prosecutors office in a report distributed by tass 
monday night said 32 people of various nationalities were 
killed in sumgait and 197 including about 100 policemen were 
injured 
in addition there were reports of 12 cases of rape thefts at 
more than 100 apartments and damage to 26 stores and more than 20 
motor vehicles the prosecutors office said 
the report which tass said was complied by investigators from 
the prosecutors office was the most complete official account of 
the unrest to date 
most of those who took part in the murders rape assaults and 
theft have been identified by now the report said some of the 
42 people who have been arrested have a criminal record 
in addition 400 people have been brought to administrative 
account for violations of public order the report said soviet 
police have the right to mete out fines and short jail terms for 
minor offensives without recourse to the courts 
the prosecutors office made no mention of ethnic hatred as a 
reason for the violence blaming it on a group of hooligans 
in february clashes took place in nagornokarabakh in which two 
people were killed and about 50 injured the prosecutors report 
said 
it said investigations were continuing to find the instigators 
pravda in a report on the dispute over nagornokarabakh used 
tough language to criticize armenian militants who have formed the 
karabakh commission to demand reunification 
they claim they fight for socioeconomic development of the 
region but they consciously or unconsciously use methods which 
western sovietologists recommend for fighting against socialism 
thus we see that a noble idea of a reunion has a clear 
antisocialist spirit pravda said 
tass in a commentary read on staterun tvs evening news 
criticized commission members i muradyan and k nagepetyan saying 
they refused to listen to people calling for reason and calm at a 
march 19 meeting of the group 
it said commission organizers cynically and perfidiously are 
willing to exploit difficulties experienced by soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs reform program 
the disputed area smaller than the state of delaware has been 
part of mostly moslem azerbaijan for 50 years even though 
threefourths of its 157000 residents are armenians most of whom 
are christian 
gorbachev has promised that another meeting of the policymaking 
central committee will be held to consider the nagornokarabakh 
question and relations among the countrys more than 100 ethnic 
groups in february the committee refused an earlier request for 
restitution of the area 
pravda did not say outright that the region should remain in 
azerbaijan but denounced using demonstrations strikes and mass 
meetings to pressure officials for a decision in favor of reunion 
paruyr ayrikyan an armenian nationalist now in moscow said he 
was told by telephone from yerevan that 7000 people marched monday 
to the press house headquarters of armenias official media to 
protest the pravda story 
the article was signed by a pravda correspondent in armenia y 
arakelyan and two other correspondents however an armenian 
official said monday night arakelyan denied seeing or signing the 
article 
they forged his name because they needed an armenian name on 
the article gamlet kocharyan an industrial worker and member of 
the governing council of the armenian city of kafar said in a 
telephone interview 
in recent weeks some officials blamed for the problems linked 
to nagornokarabakh and sumgait have been ousted

this is our last 
forest said ranger veerawat dheeraprasart pointing down a deep 
river valley if the dam is built here all this will vanish and 
nobody will ever be able to replace it 
veerawat the chief ranger of this rich wildlife sanctuary 
astride the border with burma is among thousands who have joined 
what unquestionably has become the greatest environmental battle in 
thailands history a fight to persuade the government not to 
build a dam in thailands last virgin forest 
in a country that once was junglecarpeted and teeming with 
wildlife it is rare today to see a tract of undisturbed forest an 
unpolluted river whitehanded gibbons or freeranging tigers 
antidam groups have held rock concerts and demonstrations some 
featuring lifelike models of crucified animals in their campaign 
newspapers are probing the issue in unprecedented detail former 
prime minister kukrit pramoj says the government could face a mass 
uprising if it approves the nam choan dam 
the dams proponents say nam choam needs to be built in what is 
the largest remaining area of protected forest in southeast asia 
to increase thailands energy supply by about 2 percent 
the governments electric generating authority of thailand has 
described the proposed 580megawatt dam as the last possible 
exploitable source of hydro power in the country it says it will 
create a reservoir that would also help irrigate farm land and 
assure water supplies in times of drought 
the projected dam site is still hard to get to a lurching 
ninehour drive over dirt roads from bangkok the thai capital 
followed by a fourhour jungle trek when monsoons lash the 
countryside a threeday elephant ride offers the only access 
but dam opponents claim construction of nam choan with the 
necessary approach roads facilities and ensuing human 
encroachment would spell doom for what they say is also the last 
area in thailand large enough to ensure the survival of a wide 
variety of wildlife 
found in the thung yai and the adjacent huay kha khaeng 
sanctuary an area about the size of delaware are large mammals 
such as elephant gaur tiger and clouded leopard some 350 species 
of birds and a wide range of plant life a number of the species 
are classified as endangered in thailand some worldwide 
foreign conservation groups have written letters expressing 
concern to the thai government in december britains prince 
philip head of the world wildlife fund urged an independent 
environmental impact study before a final decision is reached a 
similar plea came from more than 1300 conservationists and 
scientists at the general assembly in february of the swissbased 
international union for conservation of nature and natural 
resources 
the electric generating authority maintains that nam choan would 
degrade only 4 percent of the area but ranger veerawat who has 
served for 10 years in the sanctuary contends the 47milelong dam 
reservoir would not only eradicate a biologically vital riverine 
valley but also disrupt the migration routes of animals forcing 
them into smaller habitats 
opponents also dispute the 4 percent degradation estimate 
saying that in thailand roads built into remote forested areas 
have inevitably been followed by massive logging with collusion 
between businessmen and corrupt officials circumventing protective 
legislation 
loggers are already felling the rich forests along the park 
boundary 
pisit na patalung secretarygeneral of wildlife fund thailand 
one of some 30 private organizations opposing the proposal said 
the dam issue has raised an environmental awareness among thais 
until recent years the public appeared apathetic as the countrys 
once teeming wildlife was slaughtered and forests that blanketed 
about 70 percent of the country a generation ago were reduced to 
around 15 percent of total area today 
the dam was first proposed in the early 1970s but plans were 
shelved in 1983 in wake of protests and charges that environmental 
impact studies were sloppy and improper 
in 1986 the electric generating authority asked that the 
project be reconsidered and the government appointed a 40man 
committee headed by deputy prime minister thienchai sirisamphan to 
come up with a decision which is expected soon 
some opponents believe government leaders will be impressed by 
their arguments that thailand now has enough alternate energy 
sources including offshore natural gas and lignite to scrap the 
dam proposal 
others however feel that too many key bureaucrats and 
politicians are still little concerned over environmental problems 
another wildlife ranger sueb nakhasathien didnt sound 
optimistic 
thais havent yet put a price on the environment he said 
they dont realize that trees and water have a price that 
wildlife has a price

vice president george bush and democratic presidential contender 
jesse jackson each snared another victory sunday winning their 
parties primaries in puerto rico 
but massachusetts gov michael dukakis remained the leader of 
the democratic presidential pack because jackson picked up no 
delegates in the nonbinding beauty contest in the us 
commonwealth 
bush swept the winnertakeall gop contest in puerto rico with 
14 delegates at stake puerto rico gop chairman luis ferre declared 
that bush has the 14 delegates even though the counting was 
proceeding slowly with results from almost onethird of the 
precincts bush had picked up 97 percent of the vote while dole 
had gotten only 3 percent 
on the democratic side jesse jackson won the nonbinding 
primary that hinged more on local issues than the candidates with 
31 percent of the precincts reporting jackson had 35 percent of 
the votes the nearest contender was dukakis with 23 percent 
followed by illinois sen paul simon with 20 percent 
the 51member democratic delegation from puerto rico was 
expected to go to the convention uncommitted and vote as a bloc 
the commonwealth will send an additional five party leaders 
including the governor to the convention as delegates 
bob dole fighting for the survival of his republican 
presidential bid was in wisconsin campaigning for the states 
april 5 primary the kansas senator who has suffered a series of 
crushing losses to bush has pledged to keep his faltering campaign 
alive at least until that contest 
dole who was gravely wounded in world war ii was making a 
visit to a veterans hospital in milwaukee on sunday such 
appearances have become a campaign staple for dole who likes to 
use them to suggest he can surmount the greatest odds as he did 
when he was recovering from his crippling injuries 
those odds appeared to lengthen sunday as a poll published in 
the milwaukee journal suggested bush held a commanding lead in 
wisconsin the survey of likely republican voters with a 6point 
margin of error said 69 percent backed bush while 25 percent 
supported dole pat robertson trailed with 6 percent 
ive got a lot of hill to climb before april 5 dole 
acknowledged but added bob dole is a fighter 
on the democratic side dukakis led in wisconsin with 38 
percent with jackson at 30 percent the journal survey indicated 
the other three democrats were closely clustered rep richard 
gephardt 11 percent simon 11 percent and tennessee sen albert 
gore jr 10 percent the democratic survey had a margin of error 
of 5 percentage points 
dukakis at a boston breakfast on sunday was upbeat after his 
victory a day earlier in the kansas democratic caucuses joking 
that he was just a simple farm boy from brookline a boston 
suburb 
although he was edged out by gephardt in delegates counted 
saturday in south dakota and by jackson in texas delegates counted 
the same day dukakis remained ahead in national delegates 
the south dakota totals were in line with last months primary 
which gephardt won texas had already allocated the bulk of its 
delegates on super tuesday with the saturday figures from county 
conventions and caucuses 
the latest ap delegate count gave dukakis 5265 delegates to 
50855 for jackson and 3628 for gore simon had 1715 gephardt 
had 154 and 29265 were uncommitted to nominate 2082 delegates 
are needed 
gore told about 200 members of the harriman society a social 
club of the westchester democratic party that the countrys first 
priority should be arms control so it can change its underlying 
political relationship with the soviet union 
the next great negotiating effort beyond the strategic arms 
agreement will have to come in conventional arms control gore 
said adding there is a deep and understandable fear that the 
balance of forces could be less stable after reductions than 
before 
before his speech at a fundraising cocktail party gore said 
the april 19 new york primary may well turn out to be the 
critical contest 
jackson got an enthusiastic reception when he addressed 
california democrats meeting in palm springs all the candidates 
were invited to address the annual gathering but only jackson 
accepted 
theres room for you in the jackson campaign he said to 
cheers and applause 
all the democrats planned to spend at least three days in 
michigan this week in advance of saturdays democratic caucuses 
with 138 delegates at stake 
simon who jumpstarted his stalled campaign with a win in his 
home state of illinois last week was campaigning sunday in 
michigan where he has said he hopes for a respectable showing but 
is not expecting a victory 
id be fooling you if i said we expected to win in michigan 
he said 
gephardt was taking a day off on sunday at home in suburban 
washington the missouri congressman who was the big democratic 
loser on super tuesday and did not mount a real effort in illinois 
has staked his hopes on a strong showing in michigan and planned 
to spend almost every day of this week in the state 
bush too was in washington sunday where he has spent most of 
his time since his illinois victory last tuesday he planned to 
resume campaigning on monday 
the vice president was meeting monday in trenton with new jersey 
gov thomas h kean and some leading state republicans said the 
session could mean kean planned to endorse the vice president a 
kean spokesman carl golden would not comment on whether an 
endorsement was forthcoming 
bush planned appearances in connecticut this week with sen 
lowell weicker jr who has stopped short of formally endorsing the 
vice president but weicker like bush the scion of a powerful 
connecticut family has been going out of his way lately to praise 
him 
connecticut holds its primary march 29 with 35 gop delegates at 
stake dole planned to venture into the state toward the end of the 
week but robertson had no connecticut appearances scheduled this 
week

federal researchers working in secret have 
succeeded in igniting a nuclear fusion reaction in tiny pellets of 
hydrogen by using radiation from an exploding nuclear weapon 
according to a published report 
the new york times citing scientists and officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity reported in its monday editions that the 
successful experiment occurred about two years ago at an 
underground nuclear test site in nevada 
the results have triggered a dispute over how experiments in 
smallscale fusion or microfusion should proceed the 
newspaper said 
scientists have long tried to tame nuclear fusion reactions in 
the hope they could eventually lead to an unlimited and relatively 
cheap source of electrical power in fusion reactions which are 
found in stars and hydrogen bombs atoms are joined together to 
release energy they contrast with fission reactions in which atoms 
are split rather than combined 
in most cases the scientists have tried to use concentrated 
light from giant lasers to trigger a fusion reaction but 
laserbased fusion has never proved successful the secret 
experiment in nevada the times said instead used xray radiation 
from a nuclear weapon directed at tiny fuel pellets 
the prototype fuel pellets are glass capsules filled with 
hydrogen isotopes the times said a dozen pellets can easily fit 
on the head of a pin but their power output could be equivalent to 
hundreds of pounds of high explosives the newspaper said 
the secret achievement required more energy than expected 
scientists told the times the newspaper said scientists and 
government officials are arguing over which direction fusion 
research should go 
some say the laserbased microfusion program needs a radical 
change of course the times reported while others say the nuclear 
approach while unconventional was a milestone that generated 
valuable data that will help make fusion practical 
the times said it is believed that the experiments have never 
been publicly disclosed it said that last september sheldon 
kahalas director of the nations microfusion effort told a 
princeton university conference that the effort had reached a 
historical turning point but refused to elaborate

et tu al thats right al pacino like his 
predecessor marlon brando is bringing an urban accent and 
streetwise ways to the patrician role of marc antony in a 
production of julius caesar this week 
casting brando was a great idea because brando is a great 
actor and so is al the producer joseph papp said in an 
interview published sunday in the new york times 
when the film version of julius caesar was made in 1953 
brando was best known as the brutal stanley kowalski in a 
streetcar named desire nevertheless he won favorable reviews 
for his portrayal of the highbrow antony 
the image the idea that brando had done it was an 
encouragement to me to think that i could do it too said pacino 
who grew up in the south bronx but he insisted i have taken my 
own route 
also starring in the production which opens tuesday as part of 
papps new york shakespeare festival are martin sheen as brutus 
edward herrmann as cassius and john mcmartin as julius caesar

some clint eastwood fans showed they have a 
soft spot in their hearts for the toughguy actor when they offered 
to pay his delinquent 63 fine for a 1977 speeding ticket 
the phones have been buzzing since news of eastwoods ticket 
was publicized a week ago said district justice marion l morgret 
of this western pennsylvania community 
one altoona resident sent a 63 check for eastwoods fine and 
asked for a receipt as proof of payment the district justices 
staff returned the check uncashed since eastwood technically 
doesnt owe the fine anymore because of the statute of limitations 
eastwood was stopped on oct 23 1977 for traveling 69 mph in a 
55mph zone on the pennsylvania turnpike

hundreds of partying young people 
rioted on a gulf coast beach during the night before police moved 
in with tear gas and helicopters early sunday and a car that sped 
off a nearby ferry dock was pulled out of the gulf with two bodies 
inside 
what you have down there is a tremendous amount of 
intoxication going on all it takes sometimes is for someone to 
bump into someone else the crowd just turned into a riot said 
jim kaelin an officer with the texas department of public safety 
at least four people were stabbed and two law officers were 
injured in the midnight beach melee police said eight people were 
arrested and one person remained hospitalized sunday 
one thing led to another and it became a riot out there 
said coast guard spokesman anthony e lloyd in corpus christi 
lloyd said most of the students appeared to be highschool age 
about 30000 students were staying in this island resort for spring 
break he said 
the violence began when a motorist hit a 16yearold girl on the 
beach at this gulf coast vacation spot on mustang island offshore 
from corpus christi and tried to leave the scene said dps officer 
ag michniak 
angry youths attacked the driver and torched the car said 
police chief don perkins officers pulled the man away from the 
crowd before youths set the car on fire he said 
they stomped the car broke all the glass out of it and 
flipped it over said tom frazier 22 a student at the 
university of texas 
it took more than 100 police officers to break up the mob with 
the help of tear gas and hovering coast guard helicopters with 
searchlights 
the driver of the car a 26yearold san antonio man was in the 
nueces county jail in connection with the accident perkins said 
charges had not been filed by sunday evening 
the girl who was struck by the car was treated for abrasions and 
bruises at ami coastal bend hospital and released nursing 
supervisor sharon parrack said sunday 
a portable toilet also was set ablaze authorities said 
the first police on the scene tried to arrest two people 
involved in the alleged hitandrun accident but found the crowd 
too much to handle 
objects were tossed and thrown at the officers and they called 
for asistance said a dps dispatcher in corpus christi who would 
not give her name 
police fired seven tear gas projectiles to disperse the crowd 
kaelin said 
michniak said the dps received the first call at 1135 pm 
saturday and the disturbance was not declared under control until 
three hours later 
paul cline of port aransas said he saw a stabbing victim while 
leaving the beach 
all of a sudden somebody yelled and a guy fell he had blood 
all over his chest cline said i heard them shout hes 
stabbed hes stabbed they started tearing at his clothes and 
then the police came running over 
i left i hate to say it but i was afraid for my life 
the dps estimated the crowd at about 3000 
a good example would be to think of a high school football 
stadium where everybody ran down to the field and was packed 
tight kaelin said 
in an unrelated incident several hours later a speeding car 
crashed through a barrier at a ferry landing and sank in water 20 
to 25 feet deep lloyd said 
the small car sailed about 75 feet in the air before splashing 
into the water and sinking said coast guard spokesman bob fisher 
a ferry captain and deck saw the incident lloyd said 
the car just flew right off the ferry landing lloyd said 
it didnt stop didnt skid or anything it just went right into 
the water and they saw its tail end going down 
the identities of the two young men found in the car were not 
immediately available he said 
most of those injured in the rioting were treated at nearby ami 
coastal bend hospital and released said a hospital spokeswoman a 
17yearold boy remained at the hospital sunday in stable condition 
with a superficial abdominal wound ms parrack said

corruption is so widespread here that 
crooked guards may be watching crooks who may have been arrested by 
crooked cops defended by crooked lawyers or sentenced by crooked 
judges longtime observers say 
the only thing in the last 10 years that hasnt been crooked 
is both the das and the us attorneys office former district 
attorney edward rendell said 
various investigations in the nations fifthlargest city where 
the constitution was written 201 years ago have resulted in 
convictions or charges against judges police defense lawyers and 
prison guards the latest target of prosecutors 
the wave of corruption has hit city hall itself 
a federal jury last year convicted councilman leland beloff and 
an aide of conspiring with reputed area mob boss nicodemo little 
nicky scarfo to extort 1 million from a developer 
last week district attorney ronald castille announced that the 
arrests of seven prison guards and a cook in an escape and an 
inmates beating were part of operation ferret an 
investigation expected to yield more than 100 arrests among the 
citys approximately 1400 prison guards 
also last week a federal judge ordered former common pleas 
judge kenneth harris to begin serving a 12year sentence for 
extorting bribes to fix cases harris 67 is one of three former 
city judges who have been convicted and one of 16 who have been 
named in various investigations 
the pennsylvania supreme court in february ordered eight judges 
to be removed from the bench six permanently as a result of a 
federal investigation into cash payments from roofers union 
officials 
in harris case a lawyerturnedinformant barry h denker 
testified he gave cash to harris and two other judges now awaiting 
trial on extortion charges 
denker also said he gave money or gifts to police probation 
officers trial commissioners and court criers while maintaining 
his practice in criminal defense law 
another former lawyer romaine phillips was convicted of 
racketeering conspiracy and extortion in the harris case 
assistant district attorney patricia donleavy has said three or 
four lawyers may yet be charged a former aide to harris testified 
three lawyers gave him money to deliver to the judge in exchange 
for favorable rulings 
investigations also have targeted the citys police force since 
1983 34 officers have been convicted in bribery and conspiracy 
cases including a deputy commissioner who was convicted of 
extorting money from vice figures 
other agencies also have been hit with garbage crews accused of 
taking bribes to make pickups at businesses and city inspectors 
accused of taking bribes for licenses 
we talked to contractors who refused to work in this city 
because they refused to pay off the licenses and inspections 
inspectors or the water department castille said 
castille said he must defend some of the hardworking judges 
the hardworking city employees the cops who put their lives on 
the line and the ones who arent corrupt 
the court scandal has grabbed constant attention 
i dont remember anything thats quite comparable to what we 
have now said city solicitor seymour kurland who recently 
stepped down as chancellor of the philadelphia bar association 
my feeling now is despite the image theres a core a very 
good core of very fine judges theres a very fine core of judges 
of people in the city who are making it work 
judges and others whose images are being tarnished by what 
officials say are a few rotten apples have become angry 
after the extortion conviction of former senior common pleas 
judge herbert r cain jr us justice department prosecutor eric 
holder told reporters that corruption in philadelphias judiciary 
starts at the top and goes all through the system 
the remark prompted a heated response by common pleas president 
judge edward j bradley who said holder should keep his mouth 
shut 
i dont think what he said was widely held bradley said 
last week adding that holder told him in a letter that he also 
told reporters the overwhelming majority of judges were doing 
excellent work 
bradley said judicial corruption cases have presented an image 
problem 
realistically ive got to say it has caused the public to 
have a lower perception of the court bradley said noting the 
number of questioned or convicted judges is small compared with 125 
total judges 
in his remarks after the cain verdict holder also said he was 
struck by the fact that there doesnt seem to be a hue and cry 
from the citizens of this city 
the way that i see it as a citizen is that if you believe that 
the city officials are corrupt or the city is corrupt you always 
have a last resort and thats the courts castille said 
so if you have the courts taking envelopes of cash selling 
verdicts then what else is there

a convicted killer who escaped from a louisiana 
prison 1 years ago and has been implicated in two interstate 
kidnappings since then was arrested sunday with a companion is also 
accused in one of the abductions 
danny michael weeks 34 was serving a life sentence for murder 
and another sentence for armed robbery at the time of his escape 
from the louisiana state penitentiary at angola in august 1986 he 
was later placed on the fbis 10mostwanted list 
weeks was captured by a special 10member fbi team along with 
jorene h florea 56 said chief seattle fbi agent don s tokunaga 
weeks and ms florea apparently were just passing through the 
seattle area tokunaga said agents received an anonymous tip from 
someone who had recognized weeks as a mostwanted criminal the 
agent said 
agents converged on weeks and ms florea about a halfhour after 
receiving the tip as the two were looking into the trunk of a car 
in a residential neighborhood tokunaga said we were fortunate 
there were no incidents he said 
the two were not armed but agents had not completed a search of 
the vehicle he said 
authorities said that after weeks and a companion escaped from 
the prison aug 24 1986 the two men abducted a woman at 
knifepoint in the parking lot of an alexandria la hospital and 
forced her to drive them to houston where she was released 
unharmed about eight hours later 
the pair then forced a second woman who was a lieutenant in the 
us army to drive them hundreds of miles during a 50hour ordeal 
that took her to el paso texas where she was left in a shopping 
center parking lot 
weeks companion james lee colvin 33 of shreveport la was 
arrested not long after that incident last august he was 
convicted on fedeal charges of kidnapping using firearms during a 
violent crime illegally possessing revolvers and transporting 
stolen vehicles across state lines 
earlier this month weeks and ms florea were charged with the 
feb 23 abduction of susan kathleen vincent a guilford nc 
sheriffs deputy from a shopping center in greensboro nc she 
was released unharmed in chicago three days later 
im ecstatic ms vincent said sunday night about the 
capture im real relieved 
ms vincent said that during her abduction her captors robbed a 
bank in davenport iowa she said she also was forced to use a bank 
card to withdraw money and ended up giving her kidnappers 208 
im real glad they caught them so soon before they got out of 
the country ms vincent said the worst is over now all 
thats left is the court action 
sheriff layman godwin of ouachita parish la where weeks twice 
escaped from deputies custody in 1982 and 1983 said seattle 
authorities had better take no chances with the captured fugitive 
i just hope they learn from our mistakes that hes a sharp son 
of a gun said godwin in those two earlier escapes charges were 
dropped as part of a plea bargain 
weeks and ms florea are to appear before a us magistrate in 
seattle on monday tokunaga said 
weeks originally from roswell nm had been serving a 
99yearsentence for armed robbery and a life sentence for a 1981 
contract slaying

that slaying avoiding a possible death penalty for conviction on 
the original charge of firstdegree murder

advocates of spending limits for senate 
campaigns are regrouping for another battle pursuing a new route 
after republicans talked the last attempt to death less than a 
month ago 
the push is being led by sen ernest hollings dsc who is 
the chief sponsor of a 19word resolution that he hopes will become 
the 27th amendment to the us constitution 
hollings is proposing the amendment as an alternative to 
legislation that was stymied by a 53hour republican filibuster 
late last month 
the amendment seeks to overcome a supreme court ruling buckley 
vs valeo in 1976 that says congressionally mandated spending 
limits for election campaigns violate first amendment freespeech 
rights 
the hollings plan specifically would allow congress to restrict 
the amounts candidates can receive and spend if the amendment were 
ratified congress would have to pass legislation setting limits 
advocates of limits recite a litany of escalating campaign 
costs the average senate winner spent 3 million in 1984 up from 
600000 in 1976 sen david boren dokla says this translates 
into having to raise 10000 a week during a sixyear senate term 
the legislation the amendment would supplant called for a system 
of voluntary spending limits for senate campaigns with incentives 
like cheap postal and television advertising rates for participants 
and public financing for them if opponents refused to observe the 
limits 
that plan has 52 sponsors 50 of them democrats including 
majority leader robert byrd dwva who has been trying to bring 
it to a floor vote for nearly a year against nearsolid republican 
opposition 
republicans arguing that limits would hamper their efforts to 
gain strength in heavily democratic states held ranks through a 
record eight cloture votes the last coming feb 26 to end the 
filibuster byrd never got more than 55 of the 60 votes needed to 
shut off senate debate 
hollings says he thinks he can get the support to beat any 
filibuster against his plan but he said hes uncertain whether he 
can get the 67 votes needed to get a proposed constitutional 
amendment through the senate 
he said byrd has assured him the proposal will be brought to the 
floor in the near future im ready to go and hes ready to go 
said hollings adding that he hopes to get it approved this week by 
the judiciary committee 
there is a different political mixture involved in the 
constitutional amendment route than with the byrdboren legislation 
to set up voluntary limits 
hollings did not cosponsor the byrdboren bill neither did 
amendment cosponsors howell heflin dala or strom thurmond of 
south carolina judiciarys ranking republican sen william roth 
rdel is sponsoring a proposed limits amendment with slightly 
different wording 
a small group of republicans favors limits but supported gop 
leaders in the partisan battle over the byrdboren legislation 
sen arlen specter rpa voted against cloture eight times but 
now says his strong inclination is to support this constitutional 
amendment 
he made the statement last week at a hearing by the judiciary 
subcommittee on the constitution where battle lines were drawn on 
both political and constitutional grounds 
sen mitch mcconnell rky one of the filibuster leaders said 
he still was opposing limits because they would favor democrats if 
television is driving up the cost of campaigning he said dont 
tamper with the constitution force broadcasters to cut their ad 
rates if special interest money is becoming too dominant outlaw 
political action committees mcconnell said 
also opposing a limits amendment was the american civil 
liberties union represented by joel gora the brooklyn law school 
professor who was one of the winning lawyers in the buckleyvaleo 
case 
the aclu believes that government restrictions on political 
campaign funding infringe on freedom of speech and association 
gora said they would enshrine in the constitution itself the 
power of government to restrict campaign activity and hence 
political speech 
but washington attorney lloyd cutler who helped argue the 
losing side in the 1976 case said larger questions are involved 
the evidence is overwhelming by now that unlimited campaign 
expenditures will eventually grow to the point where they consume 
so much of our political energies and so fracture our political 
consensus that they will make the political process incapable of 
governing effectively cutler said 
one might fairly paraphrase lord actons famous aphorism about 
power by saying all political money corrupts unlimited political 
money corrupts absolutely

after 10 months one of the many unanswered 
questions in the criminal investigation of attorney general edwin 
meese iii is whether he benefited financially from his efforts on 
behalf of an iraqi oil pipeline project or scandalplagued wedtech 
corp sources familiar with the probe say 
last may 11 independent counsel james mckay launched his 
inquiry of meeses assistance to wedtech and the probe has spread 
to the attorney generals involvement with the pipeline 
in both instances mckays investigators have been examining 
stock trades made on meeses behalf by his investment manager w 
franklyn chinn chinn and meese were brought together by meeses 
longtime friend e robert wallach a central figure in both the 
wedtech scandal and the pipeline project 
it was disclosed earlier this month that 
in connection with the 1 billion proposed pipeline swiss 
oilman bruce rappaport paid 150000 to his attorney wallach who 
directed the funds to an account owned by chinn 
rappaport was a partner in the project with san franciscobased 
bechtel group inc which was going to build the pipeline 
rappaport was brought into the deal in 1985 primarily because of 
his close ties to thenisraeli prime minister shimon peres 
the money from the meese partners account wallachs 150000 
placed in the chinn account and several hundred thousand dollars 
from chinns biggest customer marymount college of palos verdes 
calif were used as capital by chinn to buy hardtoget brandnew 
stock issues which chinn sold later the same day it would have 
been difficult for chinn to obtain such stock with meeses money 
alone 
without using the holdings of the other accounts he 
controlled mr chinn may not have been able to conduct the 
number of trades he did on behalf of meese partners a 
congressional subcommittee said in a report this month 
once the stock was sold and the profit and loss determined 
chinn assigned profits and losses to his various customers 
overall meese invested 50000 and came away 18 months later 
with 95000 almost all of it gained through a total of 23 oneday 
stock trades eighteen of the trades were profitable 
in seven of the trades the attorney general didnt have enough 
money in his account to generate the profits and losses that were 
assigned him 
chinns biggest customer marymount college didnt fare nearly 
as well as meese 
was the stock trading actually a welldisguised payoff to meese 
that question is one that mckays office has been unable to 
resolve say the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
central to the criminal investigation is whether there was a 
plan to steer the proceeds of chinns stock transactions to meese 
and whether the attorney general knew about it 
the attorney general says he knew nothing about the transactions 
because he had set up a limited blind partnership with chinns 
company under which details were to be kept secret from meese as a 
way to protect the attorney general from violating rules against 
conflict of interest 
the investigators face a wall of silence from the others 
involved in setting up the financial arrangements chinn and 
wallach who are both under indictment for racketeering in the 
wedtech scandal 
wallach denied to mckays investigators that he gave anything of 
value to meese but wallach refused to tell mckay anything about 
his dealings with wedtech his knowledge of the meesechinn 
partnership and his dealings with chinn 
mckay said that after the wedtech trial expected later this year 
of wallach chinn and business associate r kent london the 
independent counsel may seek their testimony again 
the attorney generals good fortune in stock trading began 
months after he smoothed the way for wallach to discuss the 
pipeline with thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane who 
met with wallach and rappaport in june 1985 later in the year 
meese and wallach met with peres about the pipeline which was 
never built 
also during the period the stock trading was taking place chinn 
sat on the board of directors of wedtech the bronx ny defense 
contractor that allegedly paid out millions of dollars to lawyers 
and lobbyists in an attempt to influence various public officials 
including meese in the awarding of federal contracts 
one of those lawyers was wallach who was paid 13 million from 
1981 through 1986 by wedtech 
the stock trades that made profits for the attorney general took 
place some four years after meese then white house counselor 
arranged for his deputy james jenkins to intervene on behalf of 
wedtech in connection with a 32 million nobid contract to build 
small engines for the army despite the misgivings of army 
officials over what they regarded as a high price wedtech was 
awarded the contract following a white house meeting called by 
jenkins 
meese ended the financial arrangement with chinn last year after 
the investment adviser came under criminal investigation in the 
wedtech scandal and after public disclosure that chinn had sat on 
wedtechs board of directors

when nicaraguan president daniel ortega sent 
his forces into honduras last week it was not the first time 
troops from one country had crossed a border to attack enemy 
sanctuaries 
richard m nixon did much the same thing in 1970 
the parallels between what us forces and allied south 
vietnamese troops did in cambodia in april 1970 and what nicaraguan 
forces did in honduras last week are not precise 
but the justification offered for the two actions 18 years apart 
is the same that crossborder sanctuaries used by enemy forces to 
make war are fair game for the country under attack 
in 1970 north vietnam and south vietnamese rebels were using 
sanctuaries in eastern cambodia to wage war against the usbacked 
government in saigon 
on april 30 of that year more than 20000 us and south 
vietnamese troops crossed the border into cambodia to clear out the 
sanctuaries controlled by the north vietnamese 
now almost 18 years later ortega has sent his forces into 
honduras apparently for a similar purpose according to us 
estimates upwards of 1500 nicaraguan forces backed by air power 
entered honduras last tuesday to wipe out resupply facilities of 
the nicaraguan contra rebels 
the nicaraguan action prompted president reagan in response to 
a request from honduran president jose azcona to send 3200 us 
troops to honduras in a show of american moral support the troops 
are under instructions to stay away from the area of hostilities 
reagans decision touched off demonstrations in several us 
cities much as nixons decision did 18 years ago on a much larger 
scale days after nixons announcement four students were killed 
by national guard troops at kent state university 
george carver a former cia analyst on vietnam said friday it 
would be a mistake to suggest that the cambodian and honduran 
examples are analogous 
he said the honduran bases are used by a nicaraguan force 
against the nicaraguan government while for the most part the 
sanctuaries in cambodia were used by north vietnam to take over a 
foreign country south vietnam 
carver now an associate at the center for strategic and 
international studies a private research group also recalled that 
while nixon acknowledged the offensive into cambodia publicly 
ortega has not admitted the nicaraguan foray into honduras 
the reagan administration has said that the evidence confirming 
the nicaraguan presence there is beyond dispute 
in criticizing the nicaraguan action this past week reagan 
administration officials have said it constitutes a potential 
danger to honduras a country friendly to the united states 
sidestepping the issue of the presence of contra base camps in 
honduras presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the decision 
to dispatch us forces was a show of support to a country whose 
territorial integrity is being violated by the cuban and 
sovietsupported sandinista army 
but there is no evidence that the shortterm sandinista goals in 
honduras go beyond destruction of the contra camps just as the 
us target in 1970 was not cambodia but the communist sanctuaries 
there 
we take this action not for the purpose of expanding the war 
into cambodia but for the purpose of ending the war in vietnam 
nixon said at the time 
there is another key similarity nixon felt he was justified in 
going after the north vietnamese camps to strike a blow against 
communist expansionism 
ortega sees the contras in much the same way that nixon regarded 
the north vietnamese the contras ortega has said are 
mercenaries who serve american strategic aims 
a footnote the american and south vietnamese forces left 
cambodia after a few weeks us troops were gone from south 
vietnam within three years and the north vietnamese conquest was 
achieved two years later as for cambodia a communist regime took 
power in 1975 and killed an estimated 2 million cambodians during 
its extraordinarily bloody 3year rule the country is now under 
vietnamese military occupation

a large surplus of table wine in the european 
economic community will mean more competition for us producers 
according to an agriculture department report 
during the late 1970s and early 80s eec exporters supplied a 
rising share of the us wine market with imports peaking in 1984 
since then spain and portugal have joined the trading bloc 
raising eec membership to 12 countries 
based on grape wine and transportation cost comparisons 
california france and italy have similar total costs for producing 
and transporting wine to major us markets the report said 
imports of nonpremium table wines from the eec should not 
reach the levels they did in 1984 in the near future it said 
however because of its wine surplus which is projected to reach 
20 million to 25 million hectoliters in 199192 the eec will 
continue to place heavy emphasis on exports to the united states 
a liter is slightly more than a quart and a hectoliter is 100 
liters or roughly 265 gallons the eec wine surplus therefore 
could exceed 660 million gallons in four years 
the report was prepared by two cornell university agricultural 
economists gerald b white and david blandford for the 
departments economic research service 
according to studies the transportation costs of shipping wine 
to the eastern united states are about 3 per case from italy and 
france and 2 from california actual production costs were 
estimated at 998 per nineliter case in california 937 in 
france and 810 in italy 
one reason for the large eec wine surplus has been a shift in 
european drinking habits according to consumer studies in france 
a switch from highenergyusing manual labor to 
lowerenergyusing work reduced caloric needs of which wine was an 
important source the report said in addition wine had an 
old product image that was less in tune with younger people than 
other beverages such as mineral water beer and soft drinks 
the french studies probably also explain declining wine 
consumption in italy and spain where an exodus of population 
from the rural economy continues and old traditions are being 
replaced the report said 
on the other hand there has been a trend toward the consumption 
of higher quality wines produced in specific regions the report 
added accordingly eec policy for the last 15 years has emphasized 
the production of the quality wines

the agriculture department is tuning up its 
honey support program for 1988 and theres still a few days left 
to submit public comments on what to do 
congress authorized in the food security act of 1985 a 
marketing loan program for honey to help reduce inventories

loan at a specified price support level and then if he chooses 
can repay the loan at the prevailing market rate 
the law set the honey support at 64 cents per pound for 1986 and 
63 cents in 1987 it says the loan for 1988 through 1990 will be 
the rate for the previous year reduced by 5 percent however the 
198890 support cannot be lower than 75 percent of the average 
price received by honey producers in the preceding five years 
dropping the years of highest and lowest prices 
currently the loan repayment rate for 1987crop honey ranges 
between 34 cents and 40 cents depending on the color and class 
according to the most recently published figures inventories of 
cccowned honey as of oct 31 1987 totaled about 712 million 
pounds down from 1021 million pounds a year earlier

a war against the cotton boll weevil is being 
expanded in arizona after successful tests in other parts of the 
southwest says the agriculture department 
james glosser acting administrator of the departments animal 
and plant health inspection service said an initial 6 million 
program in california western arizona and northern mexico reduced 
the weevil population by 95 percent in one year and eliminated it 
in three years 
now the campaign is being extended into central and eastern 
arizona which will alleviate the problem of reinfestation from 
migrating weevils he said the expanded program will cost about 
20 million with cotton producers paying 70 percent of the bill 
expanding the program will not only protect arizona 
agriculture but will safeguard the progress made in california and 
mexico as well glosser said 
by using traps baited with the weevils natural sex attractant 
or pheromone the insects populations can be pinpointed according 
to program director frank myers of the arizona cotton growers 
research and protection council 
after that the insecticide malathion will be applied to fields 
by airplanes or with ground equipment 
similar programs are also working in the southeast where the 
boll weevil plagued cotton farmers for almost a century costing 
them an estimated 12 billion since its entry from mexico in 1892 
according to usda officials

the republicans have a runaway winner and now 
the democrats are in a quandary theyd like to keep up with the 
bushes and have one of their own but the prospects for wheeling 
and dealing are so delicious that many party leaders can barely 
contain themselves 
it keeps the excitement going says colorado gov roy 
roemer id like to have a voice 
there will be brokering says new yorks mario cuomo the 
question is where and how 
if it happens at the convention cuomo says the whole united 
states will see you in the grubby business of cutting deals i say 
thats no way to do it i say lets do it when theyre not 
watching 
tip oneill the retired house speaker harkens back to 1952 
when the democrats nominated adlai stevenson in the most recent 
rollcall convention it makes it more fun he says 
of course stevenson lost to eisenhower and the democrats were 
out in the cold for eight years former president carter says the 
boisterous 1980 convention made him weaker than when i went in 
and he is urging that the democrats find a winning ticket and 
unite behind it in atlanta 
thats the cool calculated democratic party talking the one 
whose chairman paul kirk wants to have a june summit to work 
things out before the july roll call in atlanta 
the problem is that democratic voters havent made it clear whom 
they want and party leaders fear that no one will emerge from the 
primaries 
despite the predicament the democrats can be sure that george 
bush is not taking his presidency for granted so far the struggle 
for the democratic nomination probably says more about the partys 
strength breadth of support with multiple candidates tapping 
different veins of support than its weakness no obvious leader to 
rebuild the partys old majority coalition 
the process is going to work its will predicts sen john 
kerry nobody said the process had to end by march 
for kerrys candidate massachusetts gov michael dukakis the 
process is likely to end in may one way or the other alone among 
the candidates dukakis has the money the organization and the 
wintertime success to nail down the nomination during the second 
round of primaries and caucuses 
democrats wouldnt even bother thinking about brokered 
conventions except that dukakis thirdplace disappointment in 
illinois raised questions about his dominance in the string of 
urban states to come he has from michigan on saturday to ohio on 
may 3 to eliminate the doubts with these key states in between 
wisconsin april 5 new york on april 19 and pennsylvania on april 
26 
the gary hart law of politics says that opportunity knocks just 
once every four years if dukakis stumbles in the next five weeks 
there will be little hope of redemption in california in june let 
alone atlanta in july 
sen albert gore jr after an incredible twoweek anguish over 
where to go next is now plotting an april 5 ambush in wisconsin to 
start the ball rolling his way he wouldnt seem to stand much 
chance except that sen paul simon of illinois is crossing the 
state line to make another last stand simon could drain enough 
dukakis support to deny him the victory 
like dukakis gore will either win at the ballot box or he wont 
win at all his hope is to block dukakis in april and may and then 
sweep california and new jersey on final tuesday june 6 
if the two of them slug it out without a winner then who 
jesse jackson he followed up his southern victories with second 
place in kansas last saturday and he maintains a slight lead over 
dukakis in the competition for texas delegates but many voters 
tell pollsters they would never consider voting for him this 
high negative rating probably disqualifies him from the ticket 
richard gephardt he was the democratic golden boy for a while 
but all the congressional endorsements in the world cant help if 
his trade and familyfarm message doesnt win him michigan this 
weekend 
that leaves the usual suspects cuomo sam nunn and bill 
bradley with lee iacocca on the list to add spice nunn has thrown 
in with gore but not very vigorously bradley is saying nice 
things about dukakis and cuomo is reconsidering his wellhoned 
neutrality in any event it hardly seems worth exploring the 
alternatives until the coming dukakis primaries have run their 
course

jean sutherland hasnt touched her husband or 
heard his voice in nearly three years but she lives in the capital 
of lebanon so she can stay close to the american hostage 
i am there and i feel very good there mrs sutherland said 
in an interview last week during a visit to the nations capital 
i dont have any real fears 
mrs sutherland has not courted publicity or criticized us 
government officials to draw attention to the plight of her 
scotsborn husband thomas sutherland few recognized her at a 
prayer ceremony wednesday to mark terry andersons third year in 
captivity 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld american hostage he and sutherland have 
been held in the same room for some of the time according to 
former hostages 
sutherland dean of agriculture at the american university of 
beirut was kidnapped june 9 1985 arriving in beirut after a 
visit to the united states his wife was in fort collins colo to 
finish her phd thesis in english 
a softspoken but direct woman mrs sutherland returned 
permanently to beirut in october 1985 except for periodic visits 
to see her three daughters all in their 20s she has remained in 
lebanon 
the state department granted the wives of the american hostages 
special permission to stay in lebanon which is offlimits to us 
citizens mrs sutherland is one of the few americans remaining in 
the country 
life in beirut has settled into a routine for mrs sutherland 
who teaches english at the american university and lives on the 
campus in west beirut most of her time is spent working usually 
from 7 am to 7 pm 
chaos in the country has forced many teachers to flee leaving 
the school shortstaffed mrs sutherland said although her 
schedule is demanding work gives meaning to her life and makes it 
bearable she said 
being at the university is so rewarding there is so much to 
do she said she also created two funds to raise money for the 
university and lebanese children orphaned and handicapped by the 
war 
shes really a saint said barbara henry a spokeswoman for 
the university in new york 
while often too busy to leave the campus mrs sutherland said 
she travels around the city occasionally to shop and visit friends 
especially the wives of the other hostages 
security has improved since the syrians stationed troops in west 
beirut about a year ago to quell the warring militias in a sense 
the lifestyle has changed quite remarkably and we have a sense of 
living quite normally 
murders muggings and robberies are common as in any big city 
but indiscriminate shelling has virtually ceased she said 
the challenge for lebanon these days is the economy which has 
taken a beating as a result of the civil war the electricity and 
the water often shut off and imported goods are sometimes in short 
supply she said 
while so near to her husband mrs sutherland has had few clues 
about him or his captors the hostages are thought to be held in 
the southern suburbs of beirut by proiranian shiite moslems close 
to iran 
of the nine american hostages six have wives living in lebanon 
two mrs sutherland and virginia steen were born in the united 
states the others are from the middle east 
the network of wives is a very strong support group mrs 
sutherland said although she gets together on a frequent basis 
only with ilham ghandour joseph cicippios wife cicippio was the 
comptroller at the university 
the two live on the aub campus while three other women live 
near the beirut university college where their husbands taught 
they are mrs steen and the wives of robert polhill and jesse 
turner also living in lebanon is the wife of frank h reed 
the wives pass along rumors and tips about the hostages and 
contact people they think might be helpful but it is sort of 
hard over so much time to stay in touch she said 
one of mrs sutherlands major concerns for her husband is the 
frustration that he must feel by being unable to work or use his 
time constructively 
tom was always a worker and not being able to do something 
must be driving him crazy she said 
former hostages have said boredom was one of the worst parts of 
captivity 
to amuse themselves sutherland and anderson planned an 
imaginary farm while in captivity according to the rev lawrence 
martin jenco a former hostage who spent time with them 
mrs sutherland lives in the present refusing to look too far 
into the future asked how long she expects her husband to remain a 
hostage she replied we dont know how many years it is going to 
be 
and when he is released she will be there she said

like the fog that rolls in 
from the atlantic enshrouding this base most mornings mystery 
surrounds the payday robbery and killing of the uss john hancocks 
disbursement officer 
sometime early tuesday after lt jg ratish prasad finished his 
watch at midnight someone shot him in the head at close range 
choked him and shoved his body into a storage area on the destroyer 
the killer vanished with 94629 in navy payroll and blank 
checks 
this base stunned 10 months ago when 37 sailors were killed in 
an attack on one of its ships the uss stark in the persian 
gulf is reeling from what veterans say is a crime like none in 
memory here 
the naval investigative service which is probing the 
24yearold prasads killing in conjunction with the duval county 
sheriffs office has been mum about the investigation saying it 
will remain so until there is a break in the case the sheriffs 
office also hasnt commented on the case 
some have speculated however that because visits to such a 
ship are tightly restricted the killer could be one of the 320 
officers and sailors aboard the destroyer even navy personnel 
without specific business have difficulty going aboard said chief 
petty officer art riccio a navy spokesman 
that feeling is there people are looking about asking 
questions trying to find out what is going on command master 
chief curtis t cook said in an interview with the florida 
timesunion 
or the killer could be someone who slipped through the security 
gate at the base and a checkpoint at the pier got on the ship 
committed the crime and escaped 
the navy is refusing to say if there are any leads whether it 
has any suspects or whether the probe is focusing on crew members 
however navy and civilian investigators have been interviewing 
members of the ships crew 
mayport has 35 ships including two aircraft carriers and 
18500 activeduty personnel and 3000 civilian employees 
prasad the only son of indianborn parents rameshwar and 
mithilesh was a strict vegetarian unusual in the 
meatandpotatoes navy fellow officers aboard the ship called him 
radish because of his penchant for vegetables 
as the man responsible for handing out pay prasad probably got 
to know more people than many others during nearly three years in 
the navy 
he smiled a lot he was friendly and he always said hello to 
the rest of the crew he probably could tell you by sight the name 
and probably the pay record of everyone on board cook said 
prasads mother in a telephone interview from her home in park 
forest ill told the florida timesunion his death was the 
realization of the familys worst nightmare 
we didnt want him to join it was scary for us because you 
never know what is going to happen she said 
her son had a degree in business administration from the 
university of illinois and had planned to go to graduate school 
after the navy relatives said 
officials said that at every muster since the body was found no 
one has been reported missing from the ship 
we know exactly where everyone is at riccio said adding 
that at least a fourth of the ships personnel is on duty at any 
one time and others must check in daily unless they are on leave 
the ships disbursement office is a secure area like a bank 
and the combination of the safe was issued only to those with a 
need to know riccio said 
when the disbursing office door was discovered open tuesday an 
immediate search for prasad was called said lt cmdr tim taylor 
prasad had gotten off duty at midnight then spent the night on 
board in a stateroom taylor said 
investigators initially thought prasad had absconded with the 
money but they quickly found his car still parked on the pier 
shortly afterward his body was found in an isolated storage area 
one deck below his office 
navy officials said the time of death an important element of 
the investigation hadnt been determined as far as they knew

borrowers rights provisions of the 
farm credit foreclosure law are being tested by a couples attempt 
to buy back the farm they lost in foreclosure 
a class action lawsuit in federal court by james and maureen 
leckband could affect the sales of hundreds of farms that the 
federal land bank of st paul has taken from delinquent borrowers 
the farm credit rescue law which took effect jan 6 says that 
when federal land banks decide to sell farms they must give former 
owners 15 days to buy back the land the leckbands case is viewed 
as a test of what the price should be 
a public sale of their 320acre farm near worthington was 
interrupted friday with word that the lawsuit had been filed in st 
paul leaving confusion about the validity of the sale 
the leckbands claim they are entitled to buy the farm at its 
current appraised value the bank maintains the land is worth the 
maximum offer it draws from interested buyers 
the difference can be significant now that farmland values are 
rising expectations that prices will climb can generate bids well 
over appraisal estimates 
attorneys for the bank said they had not seen the complaint and 
would not comment specifically on the case 
but in general we think fair market value is what somebody is 
willing to pay for it under a competitive bidding process said 
william collins general counsel for the st paul district of farm 
credit services which includes the bank 
in addition to the specific issue of the leckbands rights the 
suit seeks to place responsibility with national farm credit 
administration officials for interpreting the law evenly throughout 
the country the leckbands attorney james massey said the omaha 
district of the farm credit administration has given borrowers 
rights his clients are seeking 
the suit names several national and local fcs officials as well 
as the bank 
the leckbands who raise crops and livestock borrowed 316800 
between 1980 and 1983 according to the complaint after they fell 
behind on their payments the bank foreclosed on jan 13 1987 the 
leckbands were allowed to keep the property during a oneyear 
redemption period 
on feb 26 the leckbands citing the new law demanded the bank 
allow them to buy back 240 acres at the appraised value according 
to the complaint the bank said the property would be sold through 
a public competitive bidding process in which the leckbands could 
participate 
the bank specified minimum acceptable bids that exceeded recent 
appraisals by 13500 the complaint said

theres a honey of a fight on capitol hill 
and rep silvio o conte is in the middle of the stirred up beehive 
the massachusetts republican is waging a oneman battle against 
beekeepers over the governments 38yearold honey support program 
i found these entitlements to be a classic example of wasteful 
federal spending conte said in an interview we now have a 
federal program that encourages producers to have every single drop 
of honey subsidized 
the agriculture departments honey support program was created 
in 1950 sugar rationing and the need for beeswax for waterproofing 
ammunitions and equipment during world war ii had bolstered the 
honey business and the end of the war hurt the onceprosperous 
producers 
the postwar program was used sparingly for the first 30 years 
companies would give the government honey in exchange for a loan 
then redeem the loan and put the stored honey on the market when 
demand went up 
but during the 1980s world honey supplies outpaced demand 
causing prices to drop at about the same time china began 
flooding us markets with less expensive honey along with mexico 
canada and argentina 
we became a dumping ground said richard adee president of 
the american honey producers association inc and owner of a bruce 
sd honey farm that he says is the largest in the world 
domestic producers began relying more and more heavily on the 
federal supports some producers now regularly obtain federal loans 
only to default on them later leaving the government with tons of 
honey as collateral 
adee defends the program as necessary to keep domestic producers 
afloat 
everybody thinks this is a gravy train but weve lost 20 
percent of our industry in the past five years he said 
to conte the program has ballooned out of control 
we have to attack the program for what it is and not what it 
was its a free ride now he said 
in 1986 conte successfully capped the amount of money that 
could be put under loan and forfeited by each company at 250000 
but honeyindustry supporters in congress led by sen john 
melcher dmont removed the cap in the waning hours of congress 
last year 
without the cap an estimated 200 million pounds of honey will 
be subsidized at about 25 cents a pound this year approximately 
double the annual amount that was subsidized under the limitation 
conte said 
the agriculture department which supported the cap and decried 
its removal estimates the unlimited loans and forfeitures will 
cost the government an extra 61 million over the next four years 
but adee said a 2cent a pound reduction in the buyback price will 
keep costs down 
conte a 15term congressman and the top republican on the house 
appropriations committee has vowed to unleash another attack on 
the honey industry this year 
the american beekeeping federation a lobbying group is ready 
to fight back last month the federation sent out a fundraising 
letter warning of contes wrath 
the changes in the honey support program at the last moment 
during the preparation of the reconcillation budget for 1988 has 
rep silvio conte mad no furious the groups executive 
committee warned in a feb 10 letter rep conte is out for 
revenge and he will try to kill the support program for 1989 and 
forever 
in a frank assessment of its 1987 success and fear in 1988 the 
federation said there were some big bucks and time spent in 
washington to change the program but those are insignificant 
compared to what we will need in 1988 to save the program 
conte said he will be satisfied with reinstituting the loan cap 
i dont think i can get rid of the whole program id love to 
but ive been around here a long time im realistic he said

from members just before contract talks broke off 
the contract dispute centers on performers demands for a share 
of money made from commercials broadcast on cable television 
stations and advertisers attempts to reduce union costofliving 
adjustments 
the unions recently sent telegrams to all presidential 
candidates warning them of the strike and offering production 
waivers if they agree to interim contracts conceding the demands 
turned down by advertising negotiators 
the interim contract offer was given to regular advertisers as 
well and as many as 40 have said they will seek them according to 
the union 
the advertisers negotiator john mcguinn had urged agncies to 
resist signing interim contracts although he said a strike could 
last as long as six months 
the joint sagaftra membership is more than 100000 the unions 
negotiate together on the commercial contract union actors will be 
barred from auditioning or appearing in commercials but can work 
in films and on television shows

the soviet underground economy has poked through 
the surface at riga market a weekend jungle of moonlighters 
fastruble artists and curious consumers brought out by mikhail s 
gorbachevs economic reforms 
you can get anything you want here the price is the only 
thing said lyonya the curlyhaired 17yearold surveyed the 
openair sales of imitation western clothes wool and fur hats 
coats and other goods at the market in northern moscow near the 
riga train station 
a cigarette dangling from his mouth lyonya moments before had 
approached a westerner and offered to illegally exchange money 
thousands of shoppers jostle and slide through snow and ice to 
trade their rubles for goods of uncertain origin a kneelength red 
winter coat devoid of any labeling was priced at 250 rubles 400 
at the official exchange rate 
one hundred rubles 160 could buy a jean skirt with the 
sfinks brand on a triangular metal tab displaying the ancient 
egyptian monument the average worker earns about 200 rubles a 
month 
the market illustrates the opportunities and abuses of 
gorbachevs drive to loosen some of the controls on the staterun 
economy as well as the pentup demand for anything western 
blackmarket money traders and speculators who sell prized 
western goods and soviet imitations long have flourished 
underground at tourist hotels among taxi drivers and elsewhere 
but the reforms started by gorbachev the communist party 
leader have given traders a new place to operate mingled with 
legal moonlighters who produce a few items by hand to earn extra 
rubles 
gorbachev said in january that 300000 soviets drive taxis 
repair apartments run restaurants and pump gas outside the 
official economy under new laws allowing citizens more freedom to 
work for themselves or form a cooperative 
but many soviets complain cooperative goods and services are too 
expensive and those who work in them are out to make a quick 
profit meeting with factory workers several weeks ago gorbachev 
praised honest initiative but said authorities would not permit 
outright moneygrabbing 
a draft of a new law published recently indicates the government 
is planning to tax both the profits of cooperatives and the incomes 
of their members 
on weekdays riga market differs little from other farmers 
markets scattered around moscow but on saturdays and sundays it 
blossoms with the booths of several thousand merchants 
the merchants say they work for themselves or are members of 
cooperatives formed under the new law but they are reluctant to 
discuss their affairs apparently either because they are operating 
illegally or because public disapproval makes them nervous 
the newspaper moskovsky komsomolets aimed at young readers 
said in a recent article that riga market draws young people like a 
magnet and that crimes are committed here every day and in no 
small quantity 
although moscow needs such places riga market should be limited 
to 300400 sellers and officials must control the activity the 
newspaper said 
lyonya said western jeans like those he was wearing are 
available from speculators for about 100 rubles and westernmade 
boots cost 150 rubles to 200 rubles 240 to 320 
a few minutes later another young man approached the same 
western correspondent and asked if he had a jacket boots or pants 
to sell told no he followed behind and asked do you have any 
friends 
lyonya said a friend of his buys sweatshirts at the official 
price of three rubles puts an englishlanguage emblem saying 
manufactured exclusively for smash on them and sells them for 
35 rubles 
the seller who had a halfdozen shirts hanging from a line was 
asked how many such shirts he could sell in a weekend he refused 
to answer and said the query was a provocative question 
valery a muscovite with several days growth of beard and a 
widebrim black hat said he can buy the labeling and everything he 
needs for the sfinks denim line from associates at the market 
he also had for sale two childrens sweatsuits one with walt 
disneys bambi emblazoned on it for 20 rubles about 32 
he said he sells in moscow occasionally but prefers the soviet 
far east or siberia its too crowded here people have more 
money there because they earn higher salaries he said 
he said his store job offers him three days off for every one he 
works giving him plenty of time to sew the garments he declined 
to go into more detail about his business and refused to be 
photographed 
moskovsky komsomolets said one mornings police records showed a 
young russian was arrested after selling an imported jeans jacket 
for 120 rubles 190 another was selling packs of marlboro 
cigarettes for 8 rubles about 1280 
a 12yearold boy was found selling things he stole from his 
parents the newspaper said 
the main heroes of these stories are basically young guys and 
girls young communists the newspaper said do they need these 
lessons

arab americans are parlaying the palestinian 
revolt against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
into a surge of charitable contributions and domestic political 
gains 
last month the united palestine appeal and other charitable 
organizations raised 300000 to help palestinians continue a 
threemonth resistance campaign that has captured the worlds 
attention according to david sadd executive director of the 
national association of arab americans 
this compares with some 1 million these groups raised in all of 
1987 and does not include the checks sent by american palestinians 
to their relatives in the occupied territories said sadd whose 
group is a major lobbyist for an estimated 23 million arab 
americans 
theres real pride about the courageous palestinians we want 
to help them go on said sadd if they cant work we want to 
make sure they have enough resources to continue the resistance 
a civil disobedience campaign combined with intimidation by 
extremists have kept many of the 15 million palestinians under 
occupation away from their jobs in israel 
sadd said leaders of major arab american organizations are 
discussing establishing a central resource to identify areas of 
need in the west bank and gaza and to coordinate distribution of 
medicine blankets and other items 
the organizations also are trying to link up with such 
established charitable groups as catholic relief to help channel 
their aid in order to prevent israel from blocking the funds sadd 
said 
the revolt in which 100 palestinian arabs have been killed has 
provided a renewed national consciousness in the mostly usborn 
community whose parents or grandparents came from lebanon syria 
egypt and palestine 
unlike the 6 million american jews many of whom link their 
religious and national identity to israel most american arabs have 
tended to identify less with their country of origin than with 
village and family groups 
unlike the jews we dont have zionism we have always felt 
that this is our home said james zogby executive director of 
the arab american institute 
but in recent years zogbys organization and others have 
modeled themselves on longestablished jewish lobbying and 
charitable groups in an effort to unite the community and organize 
grassroots support to influence the political scene 
last year the arab american institute launched a project to 
elect arab american candidates locally and nationally and to 
pressure other candidates to confront the sensitive issue of 
statehood for the palestinians 
the west bank and gaza uprising and the harsh methods israel is 
using to quell it have given arab americans more confidence he 
said 
but other arab americans acknowledge that the inroads are 
slight and may not be lasting a wave of arab american indignation 
over the 1982 massacre of hundreds of palestinians by 
israeliallied militiamen in the sabra and chatillah refugee camps 
fizzled out 
community leaders note that arab americans are better organized 
now than they were then the longer the revolt draws on the more 
entrenched and sustained will be the support for it they maintain 
rep nick rahall a west virginia democrat of lebanese descent 
warned that while arab americans are making gains from the 
uprising the question is whether they can translate it into 
meaningful support in congress or in the presidential race 
congress traditionally has been strongly supportive of israel 
and has not spoken out against the israeli killings and beatings 
most presidential candidates have been vague when asked their views 
the exception is jesse jackson who has drawn broad support from 
arab americans for his condemnation of the israeli methods and for 
his longtime support of a role for the palestine liberation 
organization in mideast peace talks 
arab americans have contributed 175000 to his campaign zogby 
said 
since the palestinian unrest began dec 8 arab americans have 
conducted demonstrations and vigils around the country also 
sending thousands of letters to congressmen and presidential 
hopefuls 
abdeen jabara head of the arabamerican antidiscrimination 
committee said he was pleasantly surprised when he was invited by 
two groups of congressmen to brief them on his recent trip to the 
west bank his previous attempts to get congressional attention for 
the palestinian cause failed he said 
but the changes are still very slight he said public 
opinion is with us but congressional attitudes dont reflect 
this

twentynine years ago a russian clergyman 
started a unique bilingual secondary school with unlimited funds on 
deposit at the bank of faith and hope 
actually it had 23 today st sergius high school has about 
150000 less than it needs to keep going and the rev 
archimandrite anthony grabbe its founder says it might have to 
close this week unless it raises the money 
the sum of 150000 means life or death to us says grabbe 
who recently cut short some church work in the middle east to try 
to put the school on firmer financial ground 
an emergency committee will try to raise the shortfall in the 
schools 500000 annual budget among its members will be designer 
oleg cassini born a russian count grabbe said 
its not the first time the tiny school has faced an uncertainty 
in 1974 it was 40000 in the red and grabbe prepared to shut 
it but then a dying russian emigre unknown to grabbe donated his 
life savings of 40000 
in 1981 when the school again teetered near extinction a 
wealthy woman grabbe met 15 years earlier sent him 100000 in 
addition the school has received help from cassini former 
democratic presidential candidate bruce babbitt and yoko ono among 
others 
the timely donations and teachers who work without pay in a 
pinch have kept alive grabbes dream that students in grades 3 to 
12 study english and russian cultures together 
but grabbe says he cannot understand why the school is not 
thriving now since there is greater demand for russian experts as 
sovietamerican relations warm 
he describes the school as the only fully accredited 
russianenglish secondary school in the nation and one of the very 
few that seeks to preserve the culture of czarist russia grabbe is 
not a fan of the soviets and has said he considers it a passing 
phase in russias history 
harley balzer director of the russian area studies program at 
georgetown university in washington said he was not surprised to 
learn of st sergius financial woes 
we are not a nation that has traditionally regarded studying 
other peoples languages as a high priority he said 
the school which once enrolled 100 students but now has only 
27 offers a complete program of russian language history and 
culture besides a standard program taught in english 
the school is located in a mansion on manhattans upper east 
side the classrooms are small the desks and laboratory equipment 
old the schools lease runs out next year 
it was first established for youngsters from the new york 
russian emigrant community to transmit russias heritage but it 
broadened its program in 1963 to include nonrussian students said 
grabbe an official of the russian orthodox church outside russia 
who oversees orthodox congregations in several middle eastern 
nations 
its enrollment is now about half russian the rest is composed 
of a variety of backgrounds including moslems blacks jews 
chinese japanese and catholic grabbe said some graduates have 
gone on to work in us diplomatic positions 
a soviet emigrant student who transferred to the school this 
year said she is learning much more than in public school because 
of a higher teacherstudent ratio and intensive instruction 
i dont have any place to go if it closes down said the 
15yearold vadim korkhov 
as a result of the budget shortfall the 11th and 12th grades 
have been dropped enrollment has declined because parents are 
uncertain of the schools future and teachers have not been paid 
since december grabbe said 
tuition which ranges from 1800 to 4000 a year depending on 
grade level makes up only about onequarter of the budget 
its incredible that this situation exists with the current 
political climate he said 
but if all fails he said with a smile theres always the 
bank of faith and hope

rising costs last year forced a record 79 
hospitals to close their doors the american hospital association 
reported today 
the closings most in hospitals with fewer than 100 beds were 
heavy in four southern states but were evenly split overall between 
rural and urban areas the hospital group said 
hospitals that barely break even or continually lose money 
cannot buy needed medical equipment replace deteriorating 
buildings or add important services carol mccarthy president of 
the chicagobased organization said in a statement 
federal medicare payments which represent 40 percent of a 
hospitals income may be partly to blame for the closings she 
added 
hospitals saw the price of goods and services they purchase 
rise 22 percent between 1984 and 1988 while medicare raised the 
prices its pays hospitals only 11 percent she said 
of the 79 hospitals that closed in 30 states 35 were 
forprofit 30 were nonprofit and 14 were governmentowned the 
association said 
twentyfive hospitals closed in four states arkansas 
louisiana oklahoma and texas 
most of the closed hospitals ranged from 25 beds to 99 
in the past year nearly seven in 10 rural hospitals in this 
country lost money caring for patients and 50 percent of urban 
hospitals operated in the red ms mccarthy said 
jan shulman an aha spokeswoman said the 42 hospitals that 
closed in 1986 was the previous record 
in addition to the 79 hospitals that shut down 17 speciality 
outlets also closed in 13 states in 1987 most were rehabilitation 
or longterm care centers said the association

despite the aidsrelated death of pornographic 
film star john holmes industry officials insist the adult film 
business is aidsfree and that precautions such as aids testing are 
widespread 
concerned about the adverse publicity surrounding holmes death 
sex film producers and performers said last week that aids and 
venereal disease are virtually nonexistent among sexfilm stars 
industry concerns were heightened by a statement by holmes 
24yearold wife laurie 
its my belief that aids is running rapidly through the adult 
entertainment business said mrs holmes who once acted in porn 
films under the name misty dawn and whose husband died march 13 of 
a form of pneumonia brought on by acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
ron sullivan a sexfilm producer and president of the 
industrys 350member adult video association said mrs holmes 
is completely wrong 
industry figures argued they have avoided aids by testing actors 
for infection and making sure the men use condoms and antiviral 
spermicides they said the small inner circle of pornographic 
performers insist on the safety measures 
sullivan knew of no sexfilm star who has contracted aids it 
was not known how holmes got the disease but in addition to his 
14000 claimed sexual encounters over the years he used 
intravenous drugs which also can spread aids 
nina hartley who starred in such adult fare as feminist porno 
actress and intellectual tinker bell gave the porn industry 
a clean bill of health 
there is absolutely no evidence aids is rampant said the 
27yearold san francisco actress who has appeared in adult films 
for four years aids testing is pretty common but its not 
mandatory 
ms hartley suggested actors would jeopardize chances for key 
roles if they insisted on testing for their costars she said she 
knows of only a few sex stars who demand aids testing 
most of the veterans and people who have worked for quite a 
while really keep health conscious porno star angel kelly said 
in the last six months weve even begun printing up a newsletter 
to all the actors and actresses with health tips 
sullivan and ms hartley said there are only about 100 active 
sexfilm stars and they are cautious 
we are capable of taking care of ourselves and we want the 
public to know that said sullivan who organized a voluntary 
testing program for adult film actors his los angelesbased 
association is paying the 75 test costs 
were doing it because of the adverse publicity after holmes 
death saying that the industry is inundated with aids he said 
movie sex star barbii said she gets tested regularly and insists 
that her partners be tested 
most girls dont take aids seriously barbii said 
people dont talk about it its kind of hush 
but ms hartley counters that fear of aids and venereal diseases 
permeates the industry and that prevention detection and 
discretion have gained industry acceptance 
safe sex scenes are more prevalent now she said not 
every scene uses a condom and you wont see it condom use take 
over the industry but more actors are using them 
the aids virus damages the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to death from infections and cancer 
it can be spread through sexual contact needles or syringes 
shared by drug abusers or transfusions of infected blood or blood 
products

deaf children receive an inferior education 
caused in part by a misguided emphasis on placing them in regular 
public schools a government commission reported today 
the quality of education available to children who are deaf is 
poor said the commission on education of the deaf 
the 13member panel created by congress in 1986 said more 
attention must be paid to deaf students who are not college bound 
the commissions 144page report toward equality education 
of the deaf says the us department of education has pushed too 
hard to mainstream deaf children into regular public school 
classes instead of special schools or centers devoted to the deaf 
the state of the art in the education of persons who are deaf 
is characterized by inappropriate priorities and inadequate 
resources said the commission chaired by frank g bowe a 
regional commissioner of the rehabilitation services administration 
twothirds of the commission members are themselves deaf or hard 
of hearing including bowe actress nanette fabray macdougall was 
also on the panel 
the report recommended changes in the management of gallaudet 
university including appointment of a deaf majority to its board 
of trustees that was a student demand in the recent protests that 
forced the naming of the first deaf president at gallaudet 
the gallaudet protests and the commission report spring from the 
same philosophy that the deaf want more control over their own 
affairs and full recognition of deaf culture including american 
sign language their primary means of communication 
the commission said significant strides have been made in 
educating the deaf since 1965 the last time a federal panel 
recommended improvements 
but it said the actual implementation of these initiatives 
has been inadequate and sometimes misguided and that progress has 
at best been spotty and sporadic 
all too often the report said changes turned out to be 
more wellmeaning than effective 
the federal government does much more for highachieving deaf 
students than for those whom the nations schools have failed the 
ironic result is that those who need the most receive the least 
it said 
it said schools should pay attention to educational content 
rather than mere placement to what is taught rather than where it 
is taught 
the report said 95 percent of all deaf children are 
prelingually deaf left without hearing at birth or deprived 
of it in infancy and the united states is not doing a good enough 
job identifying them soon after birth 
many children have hearing impairments that go undiagnosed and 
untreated for as long as three to six years it said the 
average age of identification for profoundly deaf children in the 
united states is reported as 2 years compared to seven to nine 
months in israel 
ninety percent of deaf children have hearing parents 
the commission said most cases of deafness result from unknown 
causes more than a quarter of the cases are linked to heredity 
maternal rubella or german measles and meningitis children can 
also be deafened by infections high fevers and otitis media 
the number of deaf children in us schools has dropped from 
46279 in 197778 to 36017 in 198586 the 22 percent decrease is 
due primarily to the aging of students born during a rubella 
epidemic in 196566 
the commission said that bulge of deaf children growing up in 
the 1970s was bigger than residential schools could handle and 
helped shift the pendulum toward accommodating deaf children 
closer to home in public schools 
but even in regular schools the deaf children are often 
isolated from their hearing peers for classwork the commission 
said only 53 percent of deaf students in regular schools 
experience any degree of academic integration 
the commission said that although lipreading provides some 
language learning cues at most only 40 percent of the sounds 
produced in the english language are visible on the lips hearing 
aids can help some but other young deaf children may understand 
as little as 5 percent of what is said to them 
a residential school gives the child access for 16 hours a day 
instead of six hours to highly trained specialists who 
understand the fundamental principles of developmental 
psycholinguistics the commission said 
it said schools with classes just for the deaf are the least 
restrictive environment appropriate for many children 
the commission acknowledged some deaf children benefit from 
education in regular classes but said parents should have the 
option to place their child in schools for the deaf 
some 145 us colleges offer programs for the deaf including 
gallaudet and the national technical institute for the deaf which 
together receive 71 million in federal subsidies and educate 3500 
students 
but the only regular colleges that regularly enroll more than 
100 deaf students are california state university at northridge 
st paul technical institute and los angeles trade technical 
college

scientists have ignited a nuclear fusion 
reaction in tiny pellets of hydrogen by using radiation from an 
exploding nuclear weapon raising hopes for an unlimited source of 
energy a newspaper reported today 
the successful experiment viewed as a major advance toward 
determining the possibility of harnessing smallscale fusion 
occurred about two years ago at an underground nuclear test site in 
nevada according to the new york times 
the us government kept it secret because it did not want 
foreign countries to know about it but some details have been 
discussed at scientific conferences the newspaper said 
while revealing nuclear fusion as a potentially highly potent 
energy source the results have triggered a dispute over how 
experiments in smallscale fusion or microfusion should 
proceed the newspaper said 
scientists have long tried to tame nuclear fusion reactions in 
the hope they could eventually lead to an unlimited and relatively 
cheap source of electricity in fusion reactions which are found 
in stars and hydrogen bombs atoms are joined together to release 
energy they contrast with fission reactions in which atoms are 
split rather than combined 
in most cases the scientists have tried to use concentrated 
light from giant lasers to trigger a fusion reaction but 
laserbased fusion has never proved successful the secret 
experiment in nevada the times said instead used xray radiation 
from a nuclear weapon directed at tiny fuel pellets 
the prototype fuel pellets are glass capsules filled with 
hydrogen isotopes the times said a dozen pellets can easily fit 
on the head of a pin but their power output could be equivalent to 
hundreds of pounds of high explosives the newspaper said 
the secret achievement required more energy than expected 
scientists told said 
some scientists say the laserbased microfusion program needs a 
radical change of course while others say the nuclear approach 
while unconventional was a milestone that generated valuable data 
that will help make fusion practical the newspaper said 
nuclear fusion could be used to develop antimissile weapons and 
perhaps become a cheap source of boundless electric power the 
report said 
the times said the experiments were believed to have never been 
publicly disclosed it noted that last september sheldon kahalas 
director of the nations microfusion effort told a princeton 
university conference that the effort had reached a historical 
turning point but refused to elaborate

panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega is 
assembling a stash of cubansupplied arms outside of his nations 
military bases so his loyalists can reach them anytime says a 
panamanian pilot who defected last week 
maj augusto villalaz who was one of noriegas personal pilots 
says he flew three shipments of arms to panama from cuba and that 
noriega planned to import 500000 pounds of weapons 
he located the arms outside the military installations and he 
can handle them with his people when he wants villalaz said 
sunday on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
villalaz said ortegas wellplaced loyalists and big stash of 
cuban weapons will enable him to remain in power if he chooses 
longer than us officials seem to think 
secretary of state george p shultz is among those predicting a 
quick end to noriegas rule claiming sunday that the panamanian 
military is cracking open around noriega 
the situation is that noriega must leave sooner or later the 
sooner the better shultz said on nbctvs meet the press 
shultz said us indictments against noriega on drug trafficking 
charges would not be dropped and noriega could not have any say 
about the government that would run panama after his departure 
what he has to do is leave and he should settle quickly 
before the opportunity that is there before him to go to spain 
should disappear shultz said spain has offered noriega 
political asylum on the condition that the united states not seek 
his extradition on the drug charges 
increasingly the military is cracking open and making it 
clear that they want him to leave shultz said citing the 
defection last week of noriegas personal pilots villalaz and maj 
ramon adames 
villalaz said last weeks coup attempt against noriega failed 
because an officer who was supposed to secure the commander of 
troops protecting noriegas headquarters failed to do so he did 
not give any other details about the coup attempt 
villalaz acknowledged a noriega claim that four of the five 
officers involved in the plot against him received training in the 
united states last month but he said no us agency was involved 
in the coup attempt 
in a telephone interview raul st malo minister counselor with 
the panamanian embassy said the pilots told antinoriega embassy 
officials that 70 percent of military officers supported the coup 
attempt but that noriega has loyalists guarding the militarys 
firepower he said the antinoriega personnel include captains 
majors and colonels in all branches of the service 
st malo said other defections of highranking officers are 
expected very soon he declined to give any details of the 
pilots defection 
villalaz described noriega as a very complicated man who 
doesnt talk very much but he said noriega is a strong leader and 
has a hold on military people in key locations around the country 
hes fairly secure because he has the main places in the 
country with the weapon power the military weight villalaz 
said 
asked if he thought noriega would ever agree to go into exile in 
spain the pilot said i dont think so hes a very strong man 
villalaz said that on noriegas orders he flew three shipments 
of weapons from cuba stashing them in three locations around the 
country he said 16 such flights were planned with a total of 
500000 pounds of weapons to be put in place outside regular 
panamanian military installations 
national security adviser lt gen colin powell also 
interviewed on abc speculated that noriega could be intending to 
use the sovietmade arms to wage an insurgency of his own after he 
is deposed or for use elsewhere in central america 
but he said he believes noriegas future is dim 
he will leave sooner or later powell said we will 
continue to apply pressure he is a tough individual he will take 
every opportunity available to him to stay in power 
powell said he had no information about a report in sundays 
editions of the washington post that federal law enforcement 
officials wanted to indict noriega eight years ago on charges of 
illegally buying and transporting weapons but stalled out of fear 
it would upset panama 
we had evidence to indict him for conspiracy but the 
justice department didnt want it donald kimbler a former agent 
with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms told the post 
in a separate interview sunday panamas us ambassador juan 
sosa who supports ousted president eric arturo delvalle said that 
noriega is in his last days of power and would fall this week 
hes not governing now so either the military will continue 
to pressure to oust him or he will go on himself sosa said in 
an interview on cable news networks newsmaker sunday

the justice department will seek an 
immediately enforceable court order to force the palestine 
liberation organization to vacate its new york office a department 
spokesman says 
spokesman patrick korten said sunday that the department is 
planning to file suit in us district court in new york to force 
the closing of the plo observer mission at the united nations 
were ready to go ahead and file the papers if they dont 
close the mission voluntarily korten said 
the united states has declared the plo a terrorist organization 
but the united nations recognizes it as the only legitimate 
representative of the palestinian people 
the plo served notice last week that it planned to defy any us 
effort to shut the mission which is in a new york city townhouse 
korten said the department probably will file the suit by 
wednesday depending on how long the paperwork takes 
the chances are it would be within a day or two if they are

balancing 360 eggs on their ends may not be a 
scientifically approved way of demonstrating the supposed powers of 
the first day of spring but dont tell that to performance artist 
donna henes 
about 200 people helped henes balance the eggs at 439 am 
sunday the precise moment of the vernal equinox one of two points 
in the year when the sun crosses the equator and day and night are 
equal 
considering the hour more people showed up than i expected 
she said the egg balancing took place on a long tablelike 
platform at the south street seaport shopping area 
according to henes balancing an egg on its end is an ancient 
chinese custom that brings good luck 
scientists are dubious whether eggs really do balance during the 
equinox due to changes in the gravitational pull but henes is 
convinced 
its funny because ive asked a lot of scientists about it 
and they say its impossible henes said however when i ask 
them to join in the ritual and they see it happen they become 
instant believers 
henes who has been observing the eggbalancing ritual for the 
past 13 years said eggs are ancient symbols of fertility and 
spring around the world easter is only one of many spring 
holidays where the egg is used as a symbol of rebirth she said 
after balancing the eggs the participants enjoyed them at a 
breakfast prepared by one of the tourist attractions restaurants

what you have down there is a tremendous amount of 
intoxication going on all it takes sometimes is for someone to 
bump into someone else the crowd just turned into a riot said 
officer jim kaelin of the texas department of public safety 
the disturbance began when a motorist struck a 16yearold girl 
on the beach and then attempted to leave said police chief don 
perkins angry youths began to attack the driver but he was pulled 
away by police 
the youths then tipped over the mans car and torched it 
perkins said 
they stomped the car broke all the glass out of it and 
flipped it over said tom frazier 22 a university of texas 
student 
more than 100 officers aided by tear gas and hovering coast

you never expect a riot perkins said you dont want it 
to occur and with the cooperation of the students it wont occur 
however last night we got no cooperation 
he said his officers felt seriously threatened at one point 
during the melee 
when bottles and cans are being thrown at you you get to 
feeling endangered perkins said

a group of moderate baptists gathers tonight 
for its second annual meeting wondering if it will retain a place 
in the fundamentalistdominated southern baptist convention that 
sparked its formation 
we are southern baptists but we intend to hold up that flag 
of religious liberty and were going to yell ouch every time they 
step on that principle and were going to keep on yelling said 
the rev jim strickland a cartersville pastor who is a leader of 
the southern baptist alliance 
strickland said victories by moderates at some state baptist 
conventions last year indicate the southern baptist conventions 
annual meeting in san antonio texas this summer may be a 
highwater mark a shootout at the ok corral 
nevertheless strickland said this weeks alliance meeting at 
mercer university is not a strategy session for moderates 
the southern baptist alliance is not a political organization 
we are not going to do that footwork out there although the 
alliance supports those political efforts he said 
the alliance was formed in february 1987 in reaction to 
fundamentalist actions as they gained control of the southern 
baptist convention the nations largest protestant denominaton 
with about 145 million members 
fundamentalists maintain that the bible is without error in 
historical and scientific as well as religious areas moderates 
hold there is room for interpretation 
fundamentalists have removed moderates from leadership 
positions including the presidency of southeastern baptist 
seminary in wake forest nc in another instance an employee of 
one of the denominations agencies says he was fired because he 
said he believed jews could go to heaven without accepting jesus 
the alliance has grown to include 34 churches with more than 
20000 members plus about 2500 other member whose churches do not 
belong to the alliance strickland said the alliance is not 
intended to be the nucleus of a new denomination 
our hope as members of the southern baptist alliance is that 
we can articulate baptist philosophy not necessarily current 
southern baptist philosophy about religious liberty we want to 
call baptists who think religious freedom is important back to that 
heritage strickland said 
strickland is pastor of heritage baptist church formed less 
than a year ago partly because of fundamentalist control of the 
first baptist church of cartersville he said 
mercer university supported by the georgia baptist convention 
was itself the center of controversy last year when fundamentalists 
mounted a campaign to gain control of the school citing its 
listing as a party school by playboy magazine and the moderate 
views of president r kirby godsey 
but the georgia baptist convention last november defeated 
efforts to remove godsey the action was seen at the time as one of 
a series of victories by moderates in various state baptist 
conventions

oregon democrats have rejected a plank in 
their state party platform that would have called for reduced 
criminal penalties for growing and possessing marijuana 
in the past state democrats have approved platform planks 
advocating both outright legalization of marijuana and lessening 
criminal penalties arguing that the money would be better spent 
fighting hard drugs 
were cleaning up our act james klonoski a past state 
democratic party chair said after the marijuana plank was rejected 
sunday in the old days we used to embarrass our elected 
officials we dont do that anymore 
tom alexander a benton county state convention delegate who 
wanted the marijuana plank in platform said the main opposition 
was from gov neil goldschmidt and other elected democrats worried 
about the partys image and the upcoming elections 
the problem is that the democratic party leaders because the 
republicans have shifted so far to the right think we have to play

sen albert gore jr after meeting with israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir says he prefers direct 
negotiations between israel and its arab neighbors rather than 
the reagan administrations plan for an international middle east 
peace conference 
i think there are questions that have been given short shrift 
that deserve a more careful study the tennessee democrat told 
reporters after meeting with shamir here sunday what would the 
role of the soviet union be in the conference 
shamir maintained his opposition to an international peace 
conference in meetings with president reagan last week saying a 
soviet presence in the talks would bring more pressure on israel to 
give up land captured from the arabs during the 1967 middle east 
war 
gore spent sunday here campaigning for support in new yorks 
april 19 presidential primary he addressed about 1200 people at 
the annual dinner of the council of jewish organizations of borough

assaults this year security sources reported 
there was no immediate report of casualties and it could not be 
determined which guerrilla faction launched the assault on the 
south lebanon army outposts the second reported clash in three 
days 
after todays attack israeli and south lebanon army gunners 
shelled the shiite moslem market town of nabatiyeh with mortars and 
tank cannon in an apparent retaliation for the predawn raid 
police said 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
guerrillas fired machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades into 
the south lebanon army positions in the central sector of israels 
selfproclaimed security zone on the lebanonisrael border 
the mainly christian south lebanon army retaliated with heavy 
machine guns and mortars the sources reported 
israeli troops rushed to reinforce the army positions and opened 
up on the raiders with tank fire the sources said the fighting 
lasted for two hours until the attackers withdrew the sources said 
several positions manned by irish and finnish troops of the 
united nations peacekeeping force were caught in the crossfire but 
no un soldiers were hurt the sources added 
the zone policed by the un interim force in lebanon overlaps 
the israelioccupied buffer zone carved out in june 1985 when 
israel withdrew the bulk of its army three years after its invaded 
lebanon 
in the attack by israeli and south lebanon army on the moslem 
town two women were wounded when five shells exploded in the sarai

a standstill shopkeepers lowered their shutters businesses closed 
and schools sent pupils home

negotiations to reunite south koreas 
bitterly divided opposition collapsed again today with both sides 
refusing to compromise over sharing power and party posts 
the reunification democratic party announced it had pulled out 
of talks with the smaller party for peace and democracy and said 
there was no hope of uniting the two parties it denounced party 
for peace and democracy supporters for staging a violent protest 
that broke up talks 
the party concluded it would be meaningless and impossbile to 
continue merger talks because the positions between the parties are 
so wide apart said a reunification democratic party spokesman 
kim paeryong 
party for peace and democracy leaders said they wanted to 
continue unification talks but they recognized negotiations had 
stalled they charged the reunification democratic party wanted to 
destroy rival opposition groups 
the two parties said there was no chance of reuniting before 
national assembly elections next month both groups said they would 
mount separate election campaigns even though it would boost the 
governments chances of a major victory 
the acting party for peace and democracy president park 
youngsook said the party hoped that unification talks could be 
revived after the election if not sooner we need a strong 
leadership and a strong opposition she said 
about a dozen students staged protests at the two party 
headquarters today to demand the talks resume and wrote protests 
with blood after cutting their fingers 
some opposition leaders and lawmakers had been pushing for 
reunification of the two parties to avoid a major defeat in the 
national assembly elections expected to be held april 26 
opposition leader kim daejung and his supporters split away 
from the reunification democratic party to form the party for peace 
and democracy late last year after he and the larger partys 
president kim youngsam failed to agree on which one of them 
should run for president 
both kims ran in the dec 16 election and were defeated by 
government candidate president roh taewoo after splitting the 
opposition vote 
roh took office feb 25

israeli soldiers shot and killed a palestinian 
in the gaza strip today arab reports said and palestinians staged 
a widespread general strike in the occupied territories 
the strike which left shops shuttered and public transport 
idle came in response to a plo call for the most severe 
confrontation to commemorate the 20th anniversary of a 
palestinian guerrilla clash with israel 
also today attackers fired at a moderate arabs home the army 
bulldozed homes of suspected firebombers and a leaflet by arab 
underground leaders urged more arabs working for the israeli 
government to quit by saturday 
defense minister yitzhak rabin warned sunday night the army may 
use tougher measures against palestinians after the shooting death 
of an israeli soldier the first member of the military to be 
killed in four months of rioting 
in the gaza town of rafah soldiers today fired tear gas and 
ammunition at stonethrowing protesters abdel ahmed jaber al 
mudalal 17 of rafah died after he was shot in the chest 
according to arab reports and the palestine press service 
al mudalals body was taken to khan yunis nasser hospital the 
reports said the army said it was checking the report if 
confirmed the fatality would bring to 104 the number of 
palestinians killed since the uprising began dec 8 including four 
tear gas deaths according to un figures 
rabin told reporters the army was investigating whether the 
shooting death of sgt moshe katz indicated palestinians intended 
to expand the scope of their protests to firearms from the usual 
stones and gasoline bombs 
katz a reserve soldier died sunday in bethlehem after he was 
shot in the head at close range while on guard duty at a government 
building 
if extremist palestinian terrorist elements try to combine 
terrorist acts with civilian protests we will have to change our 
operations and take harsher measures to handle both rabin said 
attackers fired shots before dawn today at the home and car of 
jack khazmo a prominent moderate palestinian newspaper editor 
workers at the weekly al bayader assiyasi said no injuries were 
reported 
wajiha awadallah khazmos secretary said attackers fired 
many shots into khazmos house in the village of ram just north 
of jerusalem at about 245 am 
she said they also tried to burn the car but it was windy and 
rainy and the effort failed she said she did not know who 
attacked the editor whose newspaper follows a mainstream 
nationalist palestinian line 
the domestic news agency itim reported the army demolished nine 
arab houses during the night three because they belonged to 
people suspected of firebomb attacks the agency said it was the 
first time the army demolished homes of suspected firebombers new 
rules for soldiers also allow them to shoot when attacked with 
firebombs 
arab reporters said underground leaders of what palestinians 
call the uprising distributed a new leaflet no 11 calling 
for arabs belonging to or working for israeliappointed municipal 
councils in the west bank and gaza to quit by saturday 
hundreds of arab policemen resigned last week at the request of 
palestinian underground leaders who are members of the plo 
time and newsweek magazines filed an injunction with the supreme 
court today in an effort to recover news film israeli authorities 
confiscated after the shooting of katz demands for the return of 
the film made repeatedly to israeli authorities has been 
unavailing and as a result legal action is being pursued the 
magazines said in a statement 
israeli arabs on sunday decided to hold a general strike on 
march 30 to mark land day an annual national event which began a 
decade ago as a protest against the governments policy of 
expropriating arabowned land

most of the psychological tests now in use do a 
poor job of evaluating black personality and attitudes according 
to a black psychologist who says he has developed a test to remedy 
the problem 
it is time we begin to show sensitivity to black american 
culture and stop trying to make black americans conform to anglo 
test material and test biases said robert l williams a 
professor of psychology and black studies at washington university 
in st louis 
williams made the comments saturday to about 150 people at a 
psychology conference where participants studied the impact of 
ethnicity and race on their clients 
black lifestyles should be examined and understood in terms of 
their historical cultural and social realities and not in terms of 
a comparison with the experiences of other groups for example 
euroamericans said williams 
he said he has developed a standardized test for blacks called 
themes concerning blacks 
the test now being used by a number of schools corporations 
and psychologists consists of 20 charcoal drawings depicting 
various aspects of black culture and lifestyles in rural and urban 
areas he said 
culturally specific tests are necessary because people of 
various ethnic backgrounds may perform badly on tests designed for 
and by euroamericans and they may be labeled inaccurately as a 
result williams said 
mislabeling may have profoundly negative effects on 
intellectual and personality development williams said 
he said he was told by a white counselor in elementary school 
that he had only borderline intelligence and should take manual 
training programs in high school williams later went to college 
and earned a doctorate from washington university 
the conference which ended saturday was sponsored by the 
chicago school of professional psychology

m butterfly which opened sunday night is 
a brilliant new play with layers of ironies fantasies sexual and 
romantic ambiguities and gender reversals by individuals and even 
the occident and the orient 
the play californiaborn playwright david henry hwangs 
broadway debut stars john lithgow and bd wong both giving 
striking performances 
the story turns on its head puccinis opera madame 
butterfly in which navy lt pinkerton marries madame butterfly 
while stationed in japan then sails away while she lovingly 
believes hell come back 
in m butterfly meaning monsieur butterfly it is the 
foreign man posted in the orient who deeply loves lithgow plays 
rene gallimard attached to the french embassy in beijing in 1960 
the naive babyfaced gallimard who narrates the story in 
flashback from a french prison sees the woman of his dreams song 
liling bd wong singing madama butterfly he calls the 
singer butterfly ever after 
but butterfly is a chinese actor playing a woman and whether 
butterfly cares for gallimard is unknown they have an affair for 
20 years in which gallimard never sees butterfly naked or allows 
himself to realize butterfly is a man 
hwang whose plays have been acclaimed offbroadway was 
inspired by reallife reports of a similar situation in an 
espionage trial in france 
in m butterfly butterfly is a communist agent who gives 
gallimard misinformation to pass on to america about vietnam 
eventually butterfly gets him to become a courier and photograph 
documents 
at gallimards treason trial butterfly in a business suit 
tells the judge the west has a racial mentality about the east 
the west thinks of itself as masculine the east as delicate 
wanting to be submissive 
the play is talky as plays of ideas are but lithgows 
character as written and acted is a rich one gallimard had a 
wife rose gregorio and a fling with a young blonde lindsay 
frost whose frank speech he considered masculine butterfly asked 
by the judge george n martin how gallimard could not know he was 
a man says men believe what they want to believe 
the play is ambiguous about whether gallimard wanted to believe 
in his dream woman or whether he was without knowing his own 
secret homosexual the two argue about that for too long after 
the trial gallimard insisting i am a man who loved a woman 
created by a man 
the play ends like the opera with gallimard having taken over 
butterflys situation and finally her role 
director john dexter has seamlessly woven eastern and western 
stage elements stagehands wearing black so theyre unseen as 
in oriental theater move furniture and props the stage has a red 
backdrop and a black platform encircled by a sweeping white ramp 
that reaches high into the wings 
in other reviews the daily news howard kissel said the play is 
witty and filled with provocative images but baffling 
offbroadway its assets would be properly appreciated the 
review said here its slick trappings set expectations it cannot 
meet 
reviewer frank rich of the new york times said the singular 
play treats a number of universal conflicts men versus women and 
east versus west 
though m butterfly presents us with a visionary work that 
bridges the history and culture of two worlds the production stops 
crushingly short of finding the gripping human drama that merges 
mr hwangs story with his brilliant play of ideas the critic 
wrote

gov richard celeste wants defense 
secretary frank carlucci to reconsider holding national guard 
training exercises in honduras because of recent reports of 
hostilities with neighboring nicaragua 
in a letter to carlucci on saturday celeste said he was 
concerned for the safety of ohio guardsmen after president reagan 
ordered combat ready members of the 82nd airborne into the 
central american nation 
reagan sent the troops last week after nicaraguan troops 
reportedly crossed into honduras in pursuit of contra rebel forces 
battling nicaraguas sandinista government 
i urge you to defer this and all national guard training 
missions at least until the current highly charged situation is 
behind us celeste said in the letter if not what assurance 
can you provide that this is a neccessary and prudent training 
mission for our guard members at this time 
the governor also wrote that he believed the presence of us 
national guard units in honduras could undermine progress on 
central american peace negotiatons 
celeste wrote that he continued to oppose sending ohio 
engineering units into honduras for exercises scheduled for 1989 
but pledged to abide by instructions of the defense department and 
the national guard bureau 
ohio and several other states joined minnesota in a lawsuit 
challenging the guard bureaus authority to commit state guardsmen 
to training exercises outside the country over a governors 
objection a federal court in minnesota last summer ruled in favor 
of the guard bureau but the decision is being appealed 
the governors press secretary debra phillips said the letter 
was sent saturday by an overnight delivery service to carlucci so 
it will be on his desk when he gets in monday morning 
copies of the letter also were sent to ohios us senators 
john glenn and howard metzenbaum and to us rep edward feighan

the recent death of child star 
heather orourke has left mgm studio executives in a quandary over 
how to market her film poltergeist iii without appearing to 
exploit the 12yearold actress 
normal adults and obviously fathers like myself might be very 
offended said barry lorie mgms senior vice president for 
marketing 
miss orourke died feb 1 of septic shock caused by a bowel 
obstruction she had completed the film scheduled for release june 
10 last spring 
she was best known for her lines theyre heeeeere and 
theyre baaaaack which helped sell the first two 
poltergeist films 
in poltergeist iii miss orourkes character carol anne 
still haunted by ghostly beings is sent to live with relatives in 
chicago 
although lorie said the films generally appeal to teenage 
audiences whose members likely wouldnt be disturbed by miss 
orourkes death he added he could imagine angry letters from 
adults denouncing an ad campaign that appears to trade on her death 
the studio plans to test audience reactions to various ad 
campaigns shown at screenings before releasing the film june 10 
lorie said mgm has also asked the movies other main stars tom 
skerritt and nancy allen to avoid interviews that would lead to 
questions about miss orourke 
lorie said the studio is worried about tabloid exploitation 
particularly because one actor on each of the previous movies died 
shortly after shooting was completed 
actress dominique dunne who appeared in the original 1982 film 
was strangled by an exboyfriend in 1982 julian beck of 
poltergeist ii died of cancer in 1985

commuter buses from soweto 
were deserted today and four buses near durban were firebombed as 
hundreds of thousands of blacks joined the first nationwide protest 
strike since major opposition groups were banned last month 
in other violence police fired tear gas at a predominantly 
indian university and arrested students who tried to force others 
to join the boycott the strike was organized in defiance of 
emergency regulations to commemorate the 28th anniversary of a 
massacre in the township of sharpeville and to protest the banning 
of any activity by the united democratic front and 16 other 
antiapartheid groups 
police estimated 40 percent of the black work force in the 
johannesburg region stayed away from their jobs but did not give a 
figure for the number involved 
in sharpeville residents placed flowers at graves of some of 
the 69 massacre victims and held memorial services 
winnie mandela wife of jailed african national congress leader 
nelson mandela attended one of the services after arriving in the 
township south of johannesburg in a bus with other activists 
there was an unconfirmed report police ordered the bus to leave 
but mrs mandela said her group left voluntarily 
in soweto the black township of 25 million people outside 
johannesburg virtually no passengers boarded commuter buses 
according to cheryl roxmouth of the putco bus company normal daily 
ridership is about 75000 
schools and most shops in soweto were closed and residents said 
few of the hundreds of minibus taxis which carry many sowetans to 
work were operating 
south african transport services said ridership on its trains 
during morning rush hour was down by up to 20 percent it dismissed 
as inaccurate an earlier press report that said ridership was down 
by about 80 percent 
in durban four putco buses were firebombed prompting putco to 
halt service in several townships when drivers refused to work 
police reported two unrestrelated killings of blacks overnight 
one near durban and one in soweto but gave no indication if they 
were linked to the protest 
at the university of durbanwestville where most students are 
of indian descent police used tear gas to disperse protesters and 
arrested some students who tried to force others to boycott 
classes some students attending class were beaten by supporters of 
the boycott 
the strike was widespread in the johannesburgpretoria area in 
durban and around the eastern cape province city of port elizabeth 
more than 90 percent of black workers reportedly stayed home around 
the city of uitenhage where police killed 21 blacks during a 
funeral procession on sharpeville day in 1985 
there was no explicit call for workers in the cape town area to 
strike 
the united democratic front the countrys largest 
antiapartheid coalition had coordinated previous nationwide 
protests during the 21monthold state of emergency emergency 
regulations outlaw calls for strikes and boycotts but hundreds of 
thousands of black workers and students nonetheless observed these 
protests by staying away from jobs and schools 
several affiliates of the front not affected by the new ban 
took out newspaper advertisements announcing todays national day 
of protest 
police commanders threatened action against organizers of the 
strike and issued assurances that blacks wishing to work would be 
protected from intimidators there were reports of black youths 
turning back commuters but no reports of physical intimidation 
commemorative services were scheduled in several cities and 
townships to mark the anniversary of the 1960 massacre in 
sharpeville sixtynine blacks were killed and about 180 injured 
when police fired on thousands of demonstrators protesting the pass 
laws those laws which restricted blacks freedom of movement 
were repealed in 1986 
the predominantly white university of cape town and the mostly 
mixedrace university of the western cape closed in solidarity with 
the protest for similar reasons todays performance of district 
six a musical with an antiapartheid theme playing to full 
houses in johannesburg was canceled 
an afternoon protest was planned at johannesburgs university of 
the witwatersrand where the president of the student council 
rosemary hunter reportedly was detained by police early today 
sharpeville returned to the spotlight last week when it became 
known that friday had been set as the execution date for the 
sharpeville six five black men and a woman convicted of 
complicity in the mob killing of a black town councilor during 
antiapartheid riots in 1984 
appeals for clemency poured in from around the world but 
president pw botha said he would not intervene to save the six 
on thursday 15 hours before the hangings were to take place a 
supreme court judge granted a onemonth stay of execution in order 
to consider defense attorneys claims that a key state witness has

leaning back in his chair at a hotel suite as 
he waited for his next campaign appearance sen bob dole reflected 
on his reasons for remaining in the race for the republican 
presidential nomination 
while some have begun to speak of concerns about splitting the 
gop dole spoke sunday about responsibility and confidence 
its about the best thing that could happen to the party 
dole said of his decision to stay in the race even though he has 
won just one primary south dakota since he captured the gop 
caucuses in iowa 
its the responsible thing to do weve had a dozen 
republicans either look at this or formerly run as candidates now 
were down to two and we can get down to business 
although some have speculated that a loss in the wisconsin 
primary april 5 may force him out of the race dole said he thought 
his campaign work was only starting 
its the first day of spring and we still havent debated the 
issues he said weve had little press conferences that they 
called debates but now we have a real chance to debate george 
bush 
dole had challenged bush to a debate before the illinois 
primary but bush refused dole said he will try to arrange a 
debate before the wisconsin primary perhaps in wisconsin itself 
well talk about any subject hell pick two and ill pick two 
no notes no moderator just an hour or hourandahalf debate 
dole kicked off a threeday campaign swing through wisconsin 
just hours after receiving news of a milwaukee journal poll that 
showed him trailing bush nearly 3to1 among wisconsin voters 
likely to vote in the primary 
he said the poll was probably inaccurate but admitted ive got 
a lot of hill to climb 
its not surprising but i dont think its accurate he 
said it was taken right after illinois with super tuesday still 
hanging over my head my view is that you give voters a couple of 
weeks 
dole was trounced by bush on super tuesday and then lost again 
in illinois he said wisconsin was an important state for his 
campaign but a loss april 5 did not necessarily mean he would drop 
out 
weve been hearing the end is near but people forget george 
bush stayed in eight weeks after he began losing to ronald reagan 
eight weeks was enough for him to lose he said in reference to 
the 1980 gop race but i think eight weeks would be enough time 
for me to turn some things around 
although emphasizing confidence dole indicated that recent 
attention to the cuts he made on his paid national staff wore on 
his patience 
he said he picked up a newspaper sunday morning in washington 
and was pleased to see there was not a single story about politics 
it was kind of refreshing to pick up the paper and read about 
maybe not refreshing but different to read about panama 
honduras nicaragua and no politics 
there are a lot of issues that should be discussed he 
added we shouldnt be into this game about are you going to run 
or are you going to drop out and how many staff people you have and 
all that inside baseball the voter can care less about that

a misunderstanding by officers resulted 
in police breaking into the house of an elderly couple where an 
84yearold man was killed in an exchange of gunfire a prosecutor 
says 
the officers were supposed to knock on the door but thought 
incorrectly that they were being ordered inside to capture a rape 
suspect district attorney andy fuller said in an interview 
published sunday in the times of gainesville 
dillard free was killed in the christmas eve shooting fuller 
said free apparently was awakened by the sound of his front door 
being kicked down and fired two shots at officers 
a grand jury on march 10 declined to indict the officer who shot 
free but it expressed outrage about the shooting and called for a 
review of police procedures 
a georgia bureau of investigation report on the shooting remains 
sealed because of indictments against the two people who told 
police the rape suspect was in the house they are accused of 
making false statements 
fuller said he decided to discuss the gbis findings because 
the people of hall county need to know this information 
fuller said six law officers told the gbi they remembered police 
detective robert gable directing that they use normal procedure for 
serving an arrest warrant that is knocking and announcing 
warrant at the free home 
but the officers who took up positions in front of the house 
lee west gary lenderman and kirk williamson were not present to 
hear that order fuller said 
he said that when detective russell elrod told the officers by 
radio to go on in lenderman seemed surprised and asked you 
want us to go 
the evidence indicates the detectives did not mean for west 
and williamson to break the door down but the evidence also 
indicates that the uniformed officers felt they had been given a 
directive to go into the house fuller said 
west kicked down frees front door and he and williamson entered 
the darkened living room while sgt benny patrick rushed onto the 
front porch fuller said 
he said patrick saw a silhouette moving inside and shouted 
police but a shot was fired that narrowly missed his head he 
said west then also shouted police and saw the figure fire 
again striking a door frame 
west then fired two shots fatally wounding free in the thigh 
and neck 
frees wife agnes 73 was hospitalized for shock and died 
march 5 three days after suffering a heart attack 
the rape suspect the officers were seeking was arrested 
christmas day in texas

one of the countrys most 
militant antiapartheid newspapers today lost a court appeal 
seeking protection from government action clearing the way for 
authorities to shut it down for three months 
home affairs minister stoffel botha had intended to close the 
new nation in january but the papers court challenge delayed the 
move his office would not comment today on how soon he would act 
the paper was launched in january 1986 by the southern african 
catholic bishops conference as an alternative newspaper to reflect 
the daily struggles desires and aspirations of the masses 
published weekly with a circulation of 50000 to 60000 it has 
a small staff and gets many of its reports from members of 
community organizations trade unions and youth groups in the rural 
areas where the majority of black south africans live 
its editor zwelakhe sisulu has been detained without charge 
for 16 of the 26 months of publication the government has said he 
is being held because of his journalistic activities 
authorities have banned four of the papers editions and seized 
two police have raided the new nation offices and it was the 
first of six publications to be warned by botha that they could be 
closed or censored for publishing material he found objectionable 
the paper does not claim to be objective its philosophy was 
explained in the last issue journalists should not only report 
on what happens in society but should also help find solutions to 
the problems of our country 
but the paper challenged the government to prove in court that 
any of its reports were illegal under the law or the emergency 
regulations 
the johannesburg supreme court ruled last week that botha has 
nearly unlimited powers to deal as he pleases with papers he feels 
might contribute to unrest the court specifically ruled that botha 
did not have to give reasons for his decisions or actions 
the court said the paper could appeal but today the court 
turned down the papers request to keep botha from closing it 
during the nine months the appeal will take to be heard 
the decision left the way open for botha to immediately issue a 
decree closing the paper 
acting editor gabu tugwana said after the court decision we 
are pretending we dont face any suspension if the deadline for 
the thursday edition comes and we are printed good luck to us 
he noted that government gazettes in which emergency decrees 
are published usually come out on friday except in special 
circumstances we dont know if we are that special to the 
government they dont contact us they dont have to 
bothas power allows him to close a paper for up to three 
months or establish an inhouse censor but tugwana said that if 
the paper is closed it would only be allowed to reopen under even 
more stringent restrictions 
i just think the world at large internally and externally 
havent yet seen this seriously it is an action against the whole 
media he said 
there are many more axes hanging in the air that will fall on 
many others he said in reference to warnings issued against 
several other papers we are the first on the line because we 
have lesser protection as far as the government is concerned we 
are just a pamphlet

the governments superfund program 
cleaning up toxic waste dumps should go back to its old policy of 
seeking upfront payment commitments from polluters before 
beginning work an environmental protection agency official says 
gene a locero says the program faces inevitable shortfalls as 
it begins new cleanup projects before the polluting companies agree 
to pay for the work 
locero is head of the waste programs enforcement office at epa 
but plans to leave on april 15 he will become a special assistant 
to administrator lee m thomas 
his gloomy analysis of superfunds prospects appears in the 
marchapril issue of environmental forum a publication of the 
environmental law institute 
loceros boss winston porter the assistant administrator whose 
programs include superfund had not yet seen the article his 
office reported 
for the first two years of the program officials negotiated 
with companies responsible for pollution at dump sites trying to 
win agreements to pay before substantial work was begun 
but accusations of political influence on decisionmaking that 
rocked the agency in 1983 and led to many resignations also led to 
a new strategy if cleanup agreements arent reached quickly the 
agency will start site investigations and cleanup work anyway and 
seek reimbursement later 
amendments passed in 1986 that authorized an 85 billion 
program over the next five years oblige the agency to start 175 
cleanups by october 1989 and another 200 by 1991 
locero presented this worstcase analysis 
if it is assumed that the agency will fund all the starts 
itself and that the average cost is 30 million for each action 
then by october 1989 the agency would need 525 billion for these 
actions alone and 6 billion more for the 200 actions to follow 
by 1991 
epa now assumes each site will cost 21 million for cleanup 
alone not counting overhead an estimate that has more than 
tripled in six years 
companies will obviously pay for some but the agencys top 
management officials do not dispute whether there will be a 
shortfall but only how much locero wrote 
epa now tends to seek all or nothing agreements from the 
companies responsible for a site the agency has little incentive 
to craft the far more difficult agreements where some companies pay 
for only some of the cleanup followed by court action against 
recalcitrants 
locero says the court action is unlikely to be a priority 
and thus not much of a threat 
to many companies that might settle with epa this is 
equivalent to shooting the volunteers locero wrote this 
dynamic if not changed reduces the likelihood that the agency can 
look to companies for a greater share of the cleanup outputs it 
is committed to 
meeting the commitment means confronting the possibility once 
again that outside observers especially congress may criticize 
the agency by slowing down cleanup by looking to more company 
cleanups or for entering into partial settlements that are too 
favorable to the companies 
the 1986 amendments recognized that remedial action may not be 
able to achieve full restoration of every site but some in the 
agency fear that making remedy decisions that are less than full 
restoration will provoke harsh and damaging criticism of the 
program locero said 
unfortunately this has diverted attention to collecting more 
and more data to justify decisions which threatens to add more 
time to the everincreasing length of site investigations he 
added 
locero said the the agency must consider beginning cleanup 
before the investigations are finished and stop trying to make 
cleanups that will be final 
on sites that involve polluted groundwater he said epa should 
consider installing pumpandtreat systems early in the first 
months of a site investigation to capture the contaminant plume and 
keep the groundwater resource from being polluted further and save 
both time and money 
in some cases it might be just as appropriate to restrict 
access as long as the result was adequate protection of human 
health and the environment locero said

prime minister noboru takeshita told graduating 
military cadets today that japans military power should match its 
economic strength 
we cannot cope with a military threat or maintain ties with 
our allies and gain their trust without defense capabilities 
commensurate with our national power takeshita told the 410 
graduates of the national defense academy in kanagawa prefecture 
west of tokyo 
takeshitas speech was his first at the nations only defense 
college since he became prime minister last november 
takeshita said japan would use its military only for defensive 
purposes and would never threaten other nations 
he said japans defense buildup would be attained within the 
framework of the japanus security treaty while adhering to 
japans three nonnuclear policies japan bans the manufacture 
possession and introduction of nuclear arms into japan 
the united states has been pressuring japan to increase defense 
spending and take more responsibility for its defense but some 
asian nations which suffered from japanese aggression during world 
war ii have expressed concern about a japanese military buildup 
takeshita said japans security will not be guaranteed by its 
military power alone and called for a comprehensive approach to 
security including diplomatic efforts and efforts to maintain a 
continuous supply of natural resources from abroad academy 
spokesman nobuo tsuchida quoted takeshita as saying 
last year japan formally scrapped a decadeold ceiling which 
limited defense spending to 1 percent of its gross national 
product during the current 198690 defense buildup plan the 
government says japans defense spending will total 11987 billion

king hussein of jordan today called on 
moslem nations to back protesters in the israelioccupied 
territories and repeated that the the plo must join any peace talks 
the palestinian people have a rightful claim on us to support 
their uprising both on the national and international level so that 
the uprising may bear fruit hussein said in opening a conference 
of foreign ministers from the organization of islamic conference 
the group includes 45 moslem nations and the palestinian liberation 
organization 
hussein a key player in any middle east peace negotiations 
said the uprising of the palestinian people is not an end in 
itself nor is it a transient coincidental event that will soon 
wither away 
it is rather an expression of the will of an entire nation to 
fight for its freedom and right of selfdetermination in its own 
land 
hussein in his remarks prepared for delivery to the conference 
gave no specifics of what kind of help he wants for the palestinian 
protesters 
the protesters have been fighting israeli occupation forces in 
the west bank and gaza strip in an outbreak of violence that began 
nearly four months ago the united nations reports more than 100 
palestinians have died in that time from gunfire beatings and 
tear gas inhalation the first israeli soldier was killed sunday 
israel seized the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
in demanding that the plo be included in peace talks hussein 
parted ways with the united states which subscribes to the israeli 
view of the group as an illegal terrorist organization 
hussein also called on iran to accept un calls for a 
ceasefire in its 7yearold war with iraq in the latest 
escalation the two nations have been hurling missiles into each 
others cities for the past three weeks 
hussein told those attending todays conference that the war was 
a wound still bleeding and draining our resources and 
energies 
iraq has said it will stop shooting if iran does but tehran has 
said it will only comply with the un appeal when iraq is branded 
the aggressor

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
killing a key provision of a law designed to promote competitive 
bidding on government contracts setting the stage for a new ruling 
on the boundaries between congressional and presidential powers 
the court said it will hear reagan administration arguments 
challenging the comptroller generals role in administering the 
1984 competition in contracting act 
the case raises issues similar to those in the constitutional 
fight over the grammrudman deficitcutting law 
the case stems from rejection by the us army corps of 
engineers of a low bid submitted by ameron inc a new jersey 
company to repair sewer lines at the united states military 
academy at west point ny 
although ameron submitted a bid of 103 million some 200000 
less than the next lowest bidder it was rejected by the corps 
because of a problem with the bond supporting the bid 
ameron protested the rejection under provisions of the 1984 
competition in contracting act 
the law empowers the comptroller general a congressional 
watchdog to suspend the award of contracts and to award 
bidpreparation costs and attorneys fees to companies that 
successfully challenge the rejection of their bids 
the law was prompted by alleged excess costs of awarding many 
lucrative government contracts without competitive bidding the 
laws supporters said that in fiscal 1983 the government awarded 
114 billion in noncompetitive contracts out of a total of 168 
billion 
administration lawyers said the powers given the comptroller 
general in the 1984 law are unconstitutional under the supreme 
courts 1986 ruling in the grammrudman case 
in that decision the justices struck down the core provision of 
the deficitreduction law because it designated the comptroller 
general as the official with power to set acrosstheboard budget 
cuts the court said such a function impermissibly blurs the line 
separating the legislative and executive branches 
the comptroller general is appointed by the president but can be 
removed from office only by congress 
in the dispute over contract bidding the 3rd us circuit court 
of appeals said the comptroller generals powers under the 1984 law 
are within constitutional bounds 
the appeals court said the law rather than concentrating power 
in the legislative branch diffuses and divides power giving 
final control over procurement decisions to the executive but 
permitting meaningful oversight by an agent of congress 
it said the comptroller general legitimately may delay contract 
awards to assure that federal procurement officials pay attention 
to his recommendations 
the law is aimed at counteracting the apparent willingness of 
procuring agencies to frustrate congressional inquiry by rushing to 
complete challenged procurement projects the appeals court added 
justice department lawyers told the high court that the law 
gives the comptroller general nonlegislative powers to determine 
the timing of a contract between an agency of the executive 
branch and a private party 
the law was defended by comptroller general charles a bowsher 
and by democratic and republican leaders of congress 
the case is army corps of engineers vs ameron 87163

iranian gunboats today attacked a 
liberian tanker and a spanish refrigerator ship in the persian 
gulf setting them afire and norwegian officials said as many as 
54 crewmen were believed killed in a weekend iraqi raid 
maritime salvage experts speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the blaze today aboard the 10168ton refrigerator ship 
iberian reefer was fierce 
salvage tugboats were racing to aid the vessel but there were 
no immediate word on casualties the officials said 
gulfbased shipping executives said earlier at least one iranian 
gunboat fired up to 10 rocketpropelled grenades at the 61762ton 
liberianregistered fumi setting its engine room ablaze and 
blasting holes in one of its tanks 
the japanesemanaged tanker laden with saudi arabian oil was 
on its way out of the gulf the executives said salvage tugboats 
helped the fumis crew put out the fire 
the iranian attacks today were in apparent retaliation for an 
iraqi attack on kharg island oil terminal saturday 
the norwegian foreign ministry in oslo said as many as 54 
crewmen were presumed dead in that attack 
most of the crew were iranians or asians although a swedish 
officer was among the missing 
if the norwegian report is correct it would be the highest 
death toll from an iraqi raid on iranian vessels since the 
socalled tanker war began in 1984 an offshoot of the 
7yearold iraniraq war 
about 480 ships have been attacked by one side or the other 
since the war broke out until the weekend attacks more than 200 
seamen had been killed 
christen puntervold of the norwegian shipping association said 
four of the 29man crew of the tanker 253837ton sanandaj had been 
found alive after the attack saturday 
the others are missing about the other ship we dont know 
for sure but we are afraid it could be the same for them he 
said referring to the 316379ton avaj which also carried a crew 
of 29 
both ships were owned by the national iranian tanker co but 
sanandajs crew was enlisted by viking engineering which is 
norwegian owned 
bahrains information minister tariq almoayyed called for 
foreign naval forces in the region to guarantee the safety of 
shipping lanes in the gulf through which 20 percent of the 
noncommunist worlds oil supplies pass 
the minister in an interview with nbctv urged the foreign 
forces to reach a declaration that they will not allow 
interference with freedom of shipping in the gulf 
iraq meanwhile said it fired a longrange missile into tehran 
today the 105th in three weeks and that iranian gunners pounded 
its southern port city of basra in an 18hour artillery and rocket 
barrage 
there was no immediate report from tehran of a missile strike 
but the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia 
cyprus reported that the missile was fired at 340 pm in 
retaliation for the bombardment of basra 
it said there were heavy casualties in basra which the 
iranians were hammering in apparent retaliation for rocket and air 
attacks on tehran and other cities sunday 
irans official media said at least 33 civilians were killed and 
65 wounded in those strikes 
both sides have fired nearly 250 missiles into each others main 
cities and border towns since feb 29 reportedly killing hundreds 
of civilians 
the iranian news agency today reported scores of kurdish 
children aged between 2 and 10 years old were being treated in 
hospitals for injuries suffered in iraqi chemical bomb attacks 
thursday 
the children were among 4000 iraqi kurds tehran claims were 
injured in the iraqi raids on towns captured by iranian forces in a 
new offensive 
the iranians have charged that 5000 kurds in the northeastern 
towns of khomal halabja and dojaila were killed in the chemical 
bombing raids 
iran claims it has punched 9 miles into northeast iraq in an 
offensive launched a week ago 
the iraqis have admitted the loss of several towns in 
sulaimaniyeh province as iran reported fighting still raging 
between its revolutionary guards and iraqs 5th corps

the supreme court today refused to let states 
and local governments regulate the prices most of the nations 
cable television operators charge for basic service 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the 
deregulation effected in 1986 by congress and the federal 
communications commission left subscribers vulnerable to illegal 
monopoly pricing 
most of the nations 7800 cable operators provide both basic 
and premium services for an extra monthly fee subscribers 
receive channels offering exclusive sports and movie programming 
basic service includes local broadcast stations and a few cable 
networks such as cnn espn and cspan 
prior to 1984 the fcc allowed local communities to regulate the 
rates charged for basic cable service but not for premium service 
rates 
congress in 1984 enacted the cable communications policy act 
which lets local authorities regulate basic cable rates only in the 
absence of effective competition 
defining effective competition was left up to the fcc and 
the commissions definition paved the way for the deregulation of 
basicservice rates charged by more than 90 percent of all cable 
operators 
the commissions rule says any cable system faces effective 
competition and avoids local regulation of basicservice rates 
if television viewers in the area can watch at least three 
different channels without a cable hookup 
the deregulation took effect dec 29 1986 
the prices cable operators charged for basic service rose an 
average of 106 percent during the first six months of 
deregulation according to a survey released by the national cable 
television association 
the survey indicated that premiumchannel rates dropped 23 
percent during the same period 
the us circuit court of appeals here upheld the commission 
rule and basicservice rate deregulation last july 17 
the appeal acted on today was filed by lawyers for connecticut 
new york city the national league of cities and the american civil 
liberties union 
the fcc committed procedural and substantive errors that will 
preempt state and local governments of traditional cable rate 
regulation powers and will expose cable subscribers to monopoly 
pricing the appeal contended 
lawyers for the commission and the cable operators association 
urged the justices to reject the appeal 
the case is connecticut vs fcc 87671

power of labor unions to fire elected officials for disagreeing 
with union policies 
the court said it will consider killing a lawsuit by a los 
angeles area union business representative who said he was fired 
illegally by the sheet metal workers international association 
edward lynn was elected to his position with local 75 of the 
sheet metal workers union in 1981 
he and other members of the local became increasingly critical 
of how the union was spending its money and organized a dissident 
group that successfully defeated proposals to raise the locals 
dues 
the international association in 1982 placed local 75 in 
trusteeship and under the leadership of a regional official 
richard hawkins 
hawkins proposed a new dues increase that again was defeated 
with lynn speaking out against the hike 
hawkins then filed charges against lynn and the international 
union removed lynn from office he also was fined 2500 
lynn sued in federal court in 1983 accusing union leaders of 
firing him illegally and violating his freespeech rights 
a federal judge threw out the suit but the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals reinstated it 
the appeals court said that because lynn was elected to his 
position as business representative he could not be fired for 
taking a stand against policies proposed by other union leaders 
lynns removal was precipitated by his outspoken opposition to 
the proposed dues increase a position which also reflected the 
view of the majority of the union membership the appeals court 
said 
its decision drew a distinction between an elected union 
official and one who is appointed 
the supreme court in 1982 ruled that appointed union 
administrators are not protected from dismissal when there is a 
change in union leadership the high court ruled then that business 
agents of a teamsters union local could be fired for supporting a 
rival of the man elected president of the local 
the 9th circuit court said lynns firing was a different matter 
because he was elected and that he cannot be dismissed by the 
parent union to suppress dissent 
just as the international may not impose a trusteeship for 
illegitimate purposes such as suppressing dissent so it may not 
use the powers inherent in a legitimate trusteeship for similarly 
illegitimate purposes the appeals court said 
the case is sheet metal workers vs lynn 861940

shops and stores remained shuttered 
today and thousands of soldiers toting m16 rifles and tear gas 
canisters patrolled the capital at the outset of a general strike 
aimed at ousting strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
buses and taxis were operating normally but many were empty or 
were carrying fewer passengers than normal traffic was light 
many government offices appeared to be operating with limited 
personnel despite a government warning that public employees would 
be suspended if they joined in the work stoppage 
in the citys central business district where six previous 
strikes in the past nine months have had little effect most stores 
didnt open 
businessmen there have never before joined larger wealthier 
merchants and industrialists in a strike 
were sending noriega a message said the owner of one small 
shoe store who asked not to be identified we hope hes 
listening 
helmeted soldiers in battle garb patrolled nearby no violence 
was reported early in the day 
the government said the troops were deployed to assure transit 
of buses and taxis and to provide security for businesses and store 
owners that wanted to open despite the strike call by the national 
civic crusade 
many of the transportation companies are owned by the panamanian 
defense forces and those that arent require government licenses to 
operate 
aurelio barria head of the opposition national civic crusade 
said sunday the government may try to use an emergency decree to 
forcibly open industries and businesses that close during the 
strike 
the indefinite work stoppage was called after noriega commandr 
of the defense forces and the force behind the civilian government 
rejected a us plan for his removal as unacceptable illogical 
and antipanamanian 
noriega who has been indicted in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges reportedly told william walker a us deputy 
assistant secretary of state he wanted to remain in panama and 
help from a transitional government 
walker and michael kozak a state department legal officer were 
said to have offered noriega freedom from us extradition if he 
sought asylum in a third country they met with the general and his 
high command on friday 
secretary of state george p shultz appearing sunday on nbcs 
meet the press said noriega cant expect to have any say in 
the transition 
the panamanian government has responded to recent unrest with a 
state of emergency allowing it to suspend civil rights and take 
over private businesses 
the next few days are the determinant time said barria he 
predicted the strike will be very very successful the civic 
crusade is an umbrella coalition of groups seeking noriegas 
downfall 
barria also said sunday he heard meetings had been held within 
panamas defense forces to discuss what to do about noriega and 
barria said he expected some action by the military this week 
but maj augusto villalaz who had been one of noriegas 
personal pilots before defecting last week said noriega had 
loyalists and cuban arms to keep him in power 
villalaz told abcs this week with david brinkley on sunday 
that he had flown three shipments of arms to panama from cuba and 
that noriega planned to import 500000 pounds of weapons 
on sunday many panamanians flocked to supermarkets to stock up 
on food flashlights and other essentials to last through the 
coming strike 
barria confirmed sunday he had met with the papal nuncio msgr 
jose laboa but denied persistent reports that the church official 
was mediating a solution between noriega and the opposition 
barria previously said noriega approached opposition leaders 
with an idea for a panamanian solution to the crisis that would 
allow the general a future role in the military but the crusade 
rejected the idea barria said 
we dont have anything to negotiate with him except his 
departure barria said the day and the flight number 
in panama citys pacific port area of balboa dock workers 
striking because they have not been paid their full salaries vowed 
to keep the docks shut down today the union has run out of 
emergency food bags and its 800 members have not received wages for 
two weeks 
panamas already ailing economy was sent into a tailspin last 
month after noriegas indictment and the effort of thenpresident 
eric arturo delvalle to fire the general who heads panamas 
15000member defense forces noriega allies in parliament on feb 
26 ousted delvalle who has since been in hiding 
the reagan administration retaliated by backing the freezing of 
panamanian government bank deposits in the united states creating 
a critical cash shortage in panama which uses the dollar as its 
currency

the supreme court today sought the reagan 
administrations views of an appeal by hawaii officials seeking to 
roll back an annual 105 million increase in intrastate telephone 
rates 
the court asked justice department lawyers to comment on a lower 
court ruling that the state lacks authority to block the higher 
rates 
the high court is not expected to decide whether to grant full 
review to the case until hearing from the government lawyers which 
could take months 
the hawaii public utilities commission in 1984 granted a 20 
million rate increase to hawaii telephone co 105 million less 
than the company requested 
the company then filed a federal lawsuit charging that the 
reduction violated an order of the federal communications 
commission 
generally the fcc regulates interstate phone rates while state 
public utility officials regulate intrastate rates 
but the commission in 1981 adopted a plan to reduce interstate 
rates for phone users in hawaii bringing the charges into line 
with interstate rates for people in the 48 contiguous states 
the lower rates were to be phased in over four years in an 
effort to avoid a dramatic impact on rates for instate calls 
the hawaii telephone co said the commission plan bars state 
officials from imposing the 105 million reduction 
a federal judge agreed with the company and that ruling was 
upheld last september by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court said the commission properly preempted the 
states authority in this case 
no one disputes the authority of a state to establish a 
reasonable rate of return for utilities within its jurisdiction 
the appeals court said but hawaiis adjustment here was a 
fairly transparent and improper attempt to circumvent the fcc 
mandate 
the appeals court said the commission has priority in 
apportioning the cost of equipment and other expenses between 
instate and outofstate service 
the case is puc vs hawaiian telephone co 871152

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether an airline may be forced to reinstate workers when their 
strike ends making necessary the layoffs of trainees and employees 
who crossed the picket lines 
the court said it will study an appeal by trans world airlines 
in a dispute stemming from a 1986 strike by flight attendants 
twa and the independent federation of flight attendants had a 
threeyear contract that expired july 31 1984 when negotiations 
failed the union called a strike on march 7 1986 
twa hired more than 1220 new flight attendants after the strike 
began in addition about 1280 twa flight attendants crossed 
picket lines either at the outset of the walkout or as the strike 
continued for more than two months 
twa also placed new flight attendants in training including 463 
who had not completed training when the strike ended may 17 1986 
the union then filed a federal lawsuit charging twa with 
unlawfully refusing to reinstate more than 2000 workers who had 
gone out on strike 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled last may that some 
striking flight attendants were entitled to their old jobs at the 
expense of all trainees and some flight attendants who had crossed 
the picket lines 
the appeals court said the strikers should be reinstated if they 
had more seniority than those called crossovers who had not 
honored the picket lines 
but the appeals court also said the 1220 flight attendants 
hired during the strike could not be dislodged by any of those who 
stayed out during the strike 
with regard to the crossovers the 8th circuit court said they 
may not be given preferential treatment over striking workers with 
more seniority because such action impermissibly discriminates 
among union members based on the degree of their union activity 
an employer may not divide the workforce into those who 
engaged in strike activity and those who did not the appeals 
court said 
it said the 463 trainees cannot be considered permanent 
replacements in the same category as the 1220 newly hired flight 
attendants therefore the trainees were subject to displacement 
by returning strikers the appeals court said 
the distinctions were made under the railway labor act which 
governs airlines as well as railroads 
twa said it is simply incomprehensible to force employees 
choosing not to strike to give up their jobs in favor of 
unsuccessful strikers 
by a 44 vote on march 2 the supreme court ruled in another 
case growing out of the 1986 twa strike that an airline may be 
forced to continue collecting union dues from workers after its 
contract with employees has expired 
twa sought to discontinue the dues checkoff after the strike 
ended but the justices split vote automatically upheld an 8th 
circuit court ruling that the airline may not cancel the checkoff 
provision unless it is agreed to in negotiations with the workers 
the case is twa vs independent federation of flight attendants

the supreme court today turned away a legal 
dispute sparked by controversy over the health of former sen paula 
hawkins rfla 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the public 
has no right of access to pretrial statements and other materials 
generated by civil lawsuits 
lawyers for the miami herald had argued that denying public 
access to all unfiled pretrial materials in civil cases violates 
the constitutions first amendment 
in a related case the justices last november let stand a 
florida supreme court ruling that the public has no right to hear 
or see pretrial statements called depositions given during 
criminal prosecutions 
in the case acted on today the florida court extended its 
ruling on pretrial materials in criminal cases to depositions and 
other pretrial materials in civil cases 
hawkins who lost her senate seat in the 1986 election to 
democrat bob graham a former florida governor injured her back in 
a 1982 accident at television station wesh in orlando 
she sued in early 1986 charging that the accident a studio 
set wall fell on hawkins while she was taping a talk show was 
caused by the stations negligence 
the lawsuit alleged that hawkins injury became a physical 
handicap that impaired her ability to work 
while pretrial proceedings were underway hawkins continued her 
work in the senate and actively sought reelection but as a result 
of the lawsuits allegations her health became a major issue in 
the campaign coverage 
in october 1986 about two weeks before the election the 
orlando sentinel sought to intervene in the lawsuit between hawkins 
and wesh and compel access to pretrial documents including 
hospital and medical records 
two other newspapers the miami herald and the florida times 
union in jacksonville filed similar requests 
hawkins settled her lawsuit out of court in june 1987 but the 
herald continued its effort to obtain the pretrial documents 
under florida law those documents are not routinely placed in 
public court files 
the supreme court last july 2 ruled against granting access it 
relied on its earlier decision denying public access to pretrial 
depositions in criminal cases 
the herald then filed the appeal acted on today 
the case is miami herald publishing co vs gridley 871193

the supreme court today sent back to a lower 
court a dispute over a racialquota integration plan for a public 
elementary school in chicago 
the justices told the 7th us circuit court of appeals to study 
whether a challenge by a group of whites cubans and american 
indians to quotas at the walt disney magnet elementary school 
has become moot 
the court did not explain why it believes the case may have lost 
its legal relevancy but the chicago board of education contended 
that the children on whose behalf the original lawsuit was filed 
now are too old to attend the school 
the disney school was opened in 1968 on chicagos north side to 
promote integration students were selected by lottery to reflect 
the racial ethnic and economic composition of the area 
the school is considered a magnet because it offers special 
educational opportunities designed to attract a crosssection of 
the community 
many cities in the nation have adopted the magnet concept as a 
key element in integrating public schools 
chicago officials incorporated racial quotas at the disney 
school as part of the school systems overall integration plan 
adopted in response to a complaint by the federal government 
charging segregation the city signed an agreement in 1980 with 
federal officials promising to implement a citywide integration 
plan 
the quotas at disney were challenged in 1981 by parents of 
cuban american indian and white children those children were told 
they would be admitted to the school but two months later were 
informed they could not attend because the quotas had been adjusted 
in the interim 
the quotas require that white students comprise 15 to 35 percent 
of the schools population and that minorities comprise from 65 to 
85 percent 
the disney plan was upheld by a threejudge panel of the 7th 
us circuit court of appeals the panel said that chicagos 
citywide desegregation plan already had been upheld in previous 
federal court rulings precluding any attack on the quotas at the 
disney school 
the students excluded from disney are indeed necessarily 
attacking the desegregation plan as a whole by challenging its 
effect upon them the panel said 
the students parents then asked for a review of their appeal by 
all 10 members of the 7th circuit court by a vote of 64 the 
judges refused to hear the case 
judge frank h easterbrook of the 7th circuit in voting to hear 
the case said chicago has not been found to have engaged in 
racial discrimination in operating its schools some such finding 
is essential before children may be shuffled from one school to 
another on account of their race 
he added that the children who were barred from attending the 
disney school were being deprived of educational opportunities they 
may be unable to receive at any other public school in the city 
the case is samayoa vs chicago board of education 861503

the irancontra independent counsel has evidence 
that richard secord and albert hakim skimmed nearly 1 million from 
bank accounts containing money from the arms sales to iran a 
newspaper reported today 
the money was used by secord and hakim to invest in arms food 
and real estate businesses for their personal gain the chicago 
tribune reported citing unidentified sources close to the 
investigation by independent counsel lawrence walsh 
according to the report secord and hakim transferred the money 
from swiss bank accounts in three installments from august to 
november 1986 the two reportedly used 760000 from the accounts 
to buy a onethird interest in forway industries a military supply 
company in new jersey and 50000 on a plan to work with forway to 
market a laser sight for night weapons firing the newspaper said 
the tribune said walsh obtained some of his information through 
the help of willard zucker an attorney and financial adviser who 
has been granted immunity from prosecution the genevabased zucker 
managed the swiss bank accounts and allegedly set up shell 
corporations to mask the diversion of 18 million of the money paid 
by the iranians the tribune said 
a federal grand jury indicted secord and hakim along with lt 
col oliver north and former national security adviser john 
poindexter last week on charges of conspiring to siphon the profits 
from the iranian arms sales and use the money for the benefit of 
the contras fighting the leftist nicaraguan government it also 
accused secord hakim and north of using some of the money for 
personal gain 
the four have said they would plead innocent at an arraignment 
thursday 
the indictment also charged secord and hakim of conspiring to 
pay illegal gratuities to north 
zucker and a spokesman for walsh declined to comment about the 
matter the tribune said 
secord was in meetings today and unavailable for immediate 
comment said joan corbin a secretary at washington dcbased

the supreme court today refused to revive some 
allegations previously raised in former massachusetts gov edward 
j kings 36 million libel lawsuit against the boston globe 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that three 
editorial cartoons one editorial and two columns king sued over 
did not libel him 
the high court earlier this month cleared the way for a jury 
trial on kings claim he was libeled by a nov 8 1981 column 
written by david farrell who since has left the newspaper 
state courts threw out most of the exgovernors claims in 
pretrial proceedings ruling that the suedover comments and 
cartoons amounted to constitutionally protected expressions of 
opinion 
king who served as the states governor from 1979 through 1983 
contended that he was libeled in various cartoons and articles 
most of which were published in 1981 
cartoons are seldom designed to disclose facts but rather are 
ordinarily understood by reasonable viewers to be rhetorical 
exaggerated means of expressing opinions the massachusetts 
supreme judicial court said in ruling on kings suit last aug 17 
the state court said the other articles ordered dropped from the 
suit also fell within the ambit of protected opinion

the supreme court today refused to reinstate a 
150000 libel award won and then lost by a joplin mo 
policeman against his local newspaper 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that officer 
don r speer failed to prove the joplin globe acted with actual 
malice when it accused him in an editorial of using excessive 
force 
the controversy stems from an april 23 1983 demonstration 
outside a downtown joplin bar 
about two dozen protesters picketed the bar that evening because 
most of its patrons were homosexual 
speer was sent to arrest the demonstrators because they had not 
obtained a parade permit 
while making the arrests speer got into an altercation with max 
mccoy a globe reporter who was taking photographs of the 
demonstration and arrests 
mccoy who sustained injuries and whose camera was broken told 
globe editors that speer and other police officers used excessive 
force 
an april 24 article reflected both mccoys and the polices 
versions of the incident 
an editorial published two days later condemned speers conduct 
stating that while mccoy was cuffed and defenseless the officers 
continued to strike him kick him 
speer sued the papers publisher ottaway newspapers inc in 
federal court contending that the editorial had libeled him 
a jury awarded him 100000 in compensatory damages and 50000 
in punitive damages but the trial judge threw out the award the 
judge ruled that speer treated as a public figure for purposes of 
the lawsuit had not proved actual malice 
public figures who sue for libel must prove that the statement 
was false and published with knowledge or reckless disregard of its 
falsity private individuals who sue for libel have an easier task 
they must prove the statement was false and published through 
negligence 
in upholding the trial judges ruling the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals ruled last sept 9 that mccoy had nothing to do 
with publication of the editorial at issue 
a finding of institutional actual malice by the globe may not 
be based only on mccoys state of mind the appeals court said 
it added that globe editors knew mccoy as a trusted employee 
and believed him to be reliable honest and good with details 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for speer argued that the 
appeals court ruling will spur newspapers to compartmentalize 
their factfinding and writing functions since liability can only 
be imposed by persons occupying the latter status 
the appeal added rewarding a newspaper for the calculated 
deceit of an employee it retains to gather information 
constitutes an unnecessary denigration of the individuals right to 
the protection of his own good name 
the case is speer vs ottaway newspapers 87942

a resurgent right battered the 
governing christian democrats in municipal and legislative 
elections according to early returns today 
the result of sundays balloting in which hundreds of thousands 
participated despite threats of guerrilla violence sets the stage 
for a rough final year in office for president jose napoleon 
duarte a christian democrat 
the leftist guerrillas had called for a boycott of the voting 
and the sizeable turnout was hailed by politicians as a triumph for 
democracy and a demonstration of civic spirit 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena won the 
mayors post in san salvador from the christian democrats who had 
held the position for the past 24 years they also appeared assured 
of a majority in the 60seat national assembly according to 
projections made by local television stations 
the christian democrats currently hold 33 seats arena has 13 
the areneros apparently benefited from a wave of popular 
discontent with the christian democrats 
duarte was elected in 1984 on a platform of ending the war and 
improving the economic situation but four years later the war 
that has taken 65000 lives grinds on an estimated 40 percent of 
salvadorans are unemployed and inflation is running at an annual 
rate of about 40 percent 
arenas campaign slogan was change for the better which 
apparently struck a chord in the electorate 
prior to the election the chistian democrats themselves had 
conceded they would be set back by the vote citing the natural 
erosion of support experienced by a party governing in troubled 
times 
arena national chairman alfredo cristiani told a news conference 
sunday night his party if it gained control of the legislature 
would work with the christian democrats to resolve the countrys 
pressing problems 
we will not present a systematic and capricious opposition we 
must look for unity regarding certain crucial points he said 
in the san salvador mayors race armando calderon sol the 
candidate of the rightist alliance beat alejandro duarte the 
christian democratic candidate and son of president jose napoleon 
duarte 
i want to publicly recognize that mr calderon sol has won 
duarte said at a news conference sunday night he congratulated the 
salvadoran people for voting despite threats of violence from 
leftist guerrillas 
this day was a glorious gesture of the salvadoran people he 
said we have defeated the terror and violence of the left 
the third party presenting candidates nationwide was the 
national conciliation party another rightist group leftist 
parties declined to present candidates saying the war made fair 
elections impossible 
staterun channel 10 television citing unofficial preliminary 
counts estimated 66 percent of the 16 million registered voters 
had cast ballots it said that according to its projections arena 
would win an outright majority in the assembly 
mario samayoa president of the electoral council also hailed 
the electorate for turning out to vote 
he also said there had been no allegations of fraud by any party 
from any polling station in the country 
in a bid to disrupt the election leftist guerrillas blew up 
electrical lines cutting energy to much of the country saturday 
night however little violence was reported during the election 
sunday apart from rural skirmishes in the central part of the 
country no casualties were immediately reported 
power was returning gradually to some regions by today 
today was the first day since friday that salvadorans could 
expect normal transport the marxistled farabundo marti national 
liberation front an alliance of five guerrilla armies lifted its 
3dayold road travel ban as of midnight sunday 
the rebels had termed the election a farce and called for a 
boycott 
to vote is a duty the way we demonstrate we are salvadoran 
citizens said pablo castellano a 38yearold peasant farmer in 
nejapa 10 miles north of san salvador he had walked 10 miles in 
the blazing sun to cast his ballot 
the guerrillas had warned polling places would be considered 
military objectives because of the wide deployment of soldiers 
to provide election security 
they had stepped up urban violence in the 10 days prior to the 
voting three car bombs exploded in san salvador wounding three 
people 
voters were electing all 60 members of the national assembly 
the unicameral legislature and mayors and town councils for 262 
municipalities nationwide 
the guerrillas who have been fighting since 1979 demand a 
share of power in exchange for laying down their arms the 
government rejects the demand

the supreme court with four of nine justices 
on the sidelines today refused to kill a 13yearold lawsuit 
stemming from an armed confrontation between indians and federal 
agents at wounded knee sd 
the remaining five justices citing the lack of a quorum 
automatically upheld a federal appeals court ruling that clears the 
way for a trial on allegations that the governments use of army 
troops in the 1973 incident violated constitutional rights 
the suit names former presidential aide alexander haig 
exattorney general richard kleindienst and 10 other federal or 
military officials as defendants 
on feb 27 1973 an armed group of indians with grievances 
about the federal governments handling of indian affairs occupied

the fbi us marshals service and bureau of indian affairs 
police sealed off the village by setting up roadblocks before the 
71day standoff ended two indians were killed and a deputy marshal 
was wounded 
fourteen people most of them residents of the pine ridge 
reservation sued in 1975 their suit contends they were confined 
unconstitutionally because army troops helped maintain the 
roadblocks and an armed perimeter around wounded knee 
the suit relies heavily on a federal law the posse comitatus 
act that bans use of the army or air force as a civil police force 
because the use of army troops violated federal law it also 
violated the individuals constitutional protection against 
unreasonable government seizures the lawsuit says 
people who allege they were subjected to a constitutionally 
impermissible search or seizure may sue the offending officials for 
damages 
us district judge donald j porter in south dakota threw out 
the suit but the 8th us circuit court of appeals reinstated it in 
1986 
the supreme court last year agreed to review the 8th circuit 
courts ruling and todays brief unsigned opinion upheld that 
ruling 
the 8th circuit court said the involvement of army troops was 
affirmatively forbidden by a criminal law of long standing 
itself expressive of an authentically american tradition of even 
longer standing 
while acknowledging that a seizure that violates federal law 
does not necesarily violate the constitution the appeals court 
said violations of the posse comitatus act represent a special 
case 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy disqualified 
themselves from the case without explanation 
the case is haig vs bissonette 86987

the plo defied an eviction deadline today 
to vacate its un observer mission under a us antiterrorist law 
as the general assembly met in emergency session to consider ways 
to keep the mission open a court battle appeared likely 
the plo observer labib zehdi terzi made no move to shut the 
13yearold mission in a townhouse near park avenue and said he was 
awaiting us legal action against the palestine liberation 
organization 
once we see what they do then we will respond he said in 
the un delegates lounge he said last week that us authorities 
would have to drag him away 
but no confrontation or physical move to shut the mission was 
expected the us government said that if the plo does not leave 
the united states voluntarily then it would initiate legal action 
this week to make it move but us officials say they will allow 
litigation to run its course 
the united states has declared the plo a terrorist organization 
but the united nations recognizes it as the only legitimate 
representative of the palestinian people it was invited to new 
york by the united nations 
the plos counsel former attorney general ramsey clark said 
that if the united states files suit against the plo he will seek 
to dismiss the complaint 
envoy terzi said it is up to the united nations to go to court 
on behalf of the plo 
in the emergency session which started friday all speakers 
denounced the us move to close the plo mission and 50 more 
speakers were scheduled this week 
today and tuesday the assembly is scheduled to consider calls by 
some delegates to take legal action on behalf of the plo and to 
house the mission on un international territory off limits to 
us police 
the plo participates in all debates on the middle east but has 
no voting rights 
some delegates also want to move the next 159member general 
assembly to geneva in september or to shift the special session on 
disarmament in may and june to geneva but such moves are unlikely 
this week the assembly is expected to adopt a resolution calling 
on secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to take all necessary 
action including legal steps in defense of the headquarters 
agreement 
the justice department was expected to initiate legal action in 
manhattan federal court probably by wednesday to close the mission 
department spokesman patrick korten said in washington on sunday 
were ready to go ahead and file the papers if they dont 
close the mission voluntarily he said 
clark has said the closure order is illegal because it violates 
the 1947 usun headquarters treaty under which the united 
states allows un missions to operate 
clark said the antiterrorism law of 1987 and legal efforts to 
oust the plo are unconstitutional because they conflict with 
international law he said the un headquarters agreement takes 
precedence over us domestic law 
the antiterrorism law was attached to a state department 
spending bill and requires closing the plo mission by today 
the state department and united nations opposed the legislation 
on grounds it violates usun treaty obligations secretary of 
state george p shultz called it a very bad piece of 
legislation which unnecessarily glorifies the plo

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether public officials may be sued when their alleged gross 
negligence permits a child to be abused by a parent 
the justices said they will hear an appeal on behalf of a 
wisconsin boy who at age 4 was seriously and permanently brain 
damaged from beatings by his father 
social workers were accused of violating the childs 
constitutional rights by failing to come to his rescue after they 
had repeated evidence he was being beaten 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals last year threw out the 
suit against the winnebago county wis department of social 
services and two of its employees 
the boy joshua deshaney first came to the attention of the 
welfare agency when he was brought to a hospital in 1983 with cuts 
and bruises the girlfriend of joshuas father said the boy was 
injured in an attack by another child 
officials suspected he was being abused by adults a social 
worker ann kemmeter was assigned to the case 
joshua was returned to the custody of his father randy 
deshaney with a recommendation that deshaneys girlfriend move out 
of the house because deshaney had hinted she might be abusing the 
boy 
deshaneys former wife and joshuas mother melody deshaney was 
living in cheyenne wyo where the couple had been divorced 
a month after the first hospital visit joshua again was treated 
for suspicious injuries 
ms kemmeter visited the deshaney home on several occaisons and 
noticed bumps on joshuas head the boy also was treated again at a 
hosptal for various bruises and injuries also deshaneys 
girlfriend still was living at the home 
ms kemmeter visited the deshaney home on march 7 1984 and was 
told that several days earlier joshua had fainted in the bathroom 
for no apparent reason but according to court records she did not 
ask to see the boy 
the following day joshua was treated at a hospital for head 
injuries that destroyed half his brain leaving him profoundly 
retarded and institutionalized for the rest of his life 
the boys father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to 
two to four years in prison 
the county social services department and its employees were 
sued by joshuas mother on grounds the boy was deprived of liberty 
without due process 
the 7th circuit court said in dismissing the suit if the 
defendants though blameworthy did not cause joshuas injuries 
they cannot be said to have deprived him of his liberty 
deprivation implies causation 
the appeals court continued it is unlikely that ann 
kemmeters wellintentioned but ineffectual intervention did joshua 
any good at all but it is most unlikely that it did him any harm 
she merely failed to protect him from his bestial father 
the appeals court added that ms kemmeter failed to act on 
mounting and eventually overwhelming evidence that joshua was in 
great peril from his father 
but the appeals court said it would place welfare agencies in an 
unfair predicament to require them to take custody of children who 
are suspected victims of abuse 
to place every state welfare department on the razors edge 
where if it terminates parental rights it is exposed to suit by 
the parent and if it fails to terminate those rights it is 
exposed to suit by the child is unlikely to improve the 
welfare of american families and is not grounded in constitutional 
text or principle the appeals court said 
in her appeal to the supreme court mrs deshaney said the 7th 
circuit court ruling is in conflict with decisions by other appeals 
courts 
in other action the court 
left unresolved whether public school students enjoy any 
constitutional protection against paddling or other corporal 
punishment by teachers and administrators 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling in a new mexico case that at some degree of excessiveness 
or cruelty such punishment violates constitutional rights but 
another appeals court has rejected that view 
refused to let the dalkon shields maker set up a 15 million 
emergency fund to help women who say the contraceptive device left 
them infertile 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that blocks 
creation of the fund pending the outcome of bankruptcy proceedings 
for ah robins which manufactures the device 
in a related case the court refused to review a ruling that at 
least temporarily barred some dalkon shield users from suing aetna 
casualty amp surety co which insures ah robins for liability 
claims 
rejected a constitutional attack on a federal law requiring 
broadcasters to give equal time to opposing candidates for public 
office 
the justices without comment turned down the appeal of a 
sacramento calif television reporter kept off the air while he 
ran for a nonsalaried town council seat 
agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law designed 
to promote competitive bidding on government contracts setting the 
stage for a new ruling on the boundaries between congressional and 
presidential powers 
the court said it will hear reagan administration arguments 
challenging the comptroller generals role in administering the 
1984 competition in contracting act 
agreed to decide whether states may impose sales taxes on most 
books newspapers and magazines while exempting religious 
publications 
the justices said they will review a texas court ruling that 
said such a tax neither violates equalprotection rights nor 
breeches the constitutionally required separation of church and 
state 
refused to let states and local governments regulate the 
prices most of the nations cable television operators charge for 
basic service 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the 
deregulation effected in 1986 by congress and the federal 
communications commission left subscribers vulnerable to illegal 
monopoly pricing 
agreed to examine the power of labor unions to fire elected 
officials for disagreeing with union policies 
the court said it will consider killing a lawsuit by a los 
angeles area union business representative who said he was fired 
illegally by the sheet metal workers international association 
agreed to consider shielding states from having to help pay 
for cleaning up hazardous waste sites when the federal government 
sues businesses under the socalled superfund law 
the court said it will hear arguments by pennsylvania officials 
that exposing states to such liability could saddle them with 100 
billion in cleanup costs

lt col oliver norths request to retire from 
the marine corps later this spring has received final approval from 
the navy pentagon officials said today 
north the fired national security aide who was indicted last 
week in connection with the irancontra affair also has received 
permission to start using up his accumulated leave and will no 
longer have to report for work at marine corps headquarters 
lt col north began his terminal leave today said lt col 
john shotwell a marine corps spokesman he had sufficient leave 
on the books to cover the period from now until his retirement on 
may 1 
north announced friday that he had decided to retire from active 
duty saying the step was necessary because he would likely have to 
subpoena the highest ranking officials in our government to 
defend himself against the irancontra charges 
that strikes me as a course of action incompatible with my 
continued service as a marine officer north said at the time 
accordingly with great sadness i have tendered my request to 
retire from the marine corps 
north becomes eligible to retire with a military pension on may 
1 the point at which he will have spent 20 years on active duty 
he automatically had the right to request retirement on that date 
but needed a waiver of a requirement that he provide at least four 
months advance notice of his plans 
that waiver was approved by chase untermeyer the assistant navy 
secretary for manpower and reserve affairs 
north was reassigned to marine corps headquarters on the 
planning staff in november 1986 after president reagan fired him as 
an aide to the national security council 
north former national security advisor rear adm john 
poindexter and two others were indicted by a federal grand jury 
march 16 on charges they conspired to divert iranian arms sales 
profits to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
the 23count indictment which also named retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord and his business partner albert hakim said 
the defendants organized directed and concealed a program to 
continue funding of and logistical and other support for military 
and paramilitary operations in nicaragua by the contras at a time 
us law barred such action

the supreme court today refused to let the 
dalkon shields maker set up a 15 million emergency fund to help 
women who say the contraceptive device left them infertile 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that blocks 
creation of the fund pending the outcome ofbankruptcy proceedings 
for ah robins which manufactures the device 
in a related case the court refused to review a ruling that at 
least temporarily barred some dalkon shield users from suing aetna 
casualty amp surety co which insures ah robins for liability 
claims 
robins facing massive damage claims from hundreds of thousands 
of women filed for bankruptcy in 1985 to protect the companys 
assets its intrauterine device allegedly caused pelvic 
inflammation spontaneous abortions infertility and in a few 
cases death 
robins filed for bankruptcy under what is known as chapter 11 a 
law that allows debtors to protect assets while repaying debts 
under a courtdevised plan 
the company stopped marketing the dalkon shield in 1974 but did 
not actually recall the product until 1984 
robins reported on march 7 that it had a fourthquarter loss of 
169 billion in 1987 due to funds set aside for dalkon shield 
injury claims the company reported an 818 million profit for the 
year 
the case acted on today involving the 15 million fund centered 
on an attempt by robins to trim some of its losses and to provide 
immediate money for women who could undergo corrective surgery or 
become pregnant through in vitro fertilization 
that procedure involves fertilizing the womans egg outside her 
womb 
robins said the surgery costing approximately 15000 per 
woman or the in vitro procedure would give women approaching the 
end of their safe childbearing years a chance to have children 
many claimants who used the dalkon shield when it was 
introduced in the early 1970s are approaching the biological 
deadline the company said it added that the emergency fund 
serves humanitarian purposes and makes good business sense because 
it could reduce claims against robins by women whose fertility is 
restored 
lawyers representing women suing the company also supported the 
idea the fund was approved last may 21 by us district judge 
robert r merhige jr in richmond va who is presiding over 
nationwide claims against robins 
merhige separately has ordered robins to create a 248 billion 
trust fund to pay some 200000 claims against the company robins 
had paid 500 million in damages before filing for bankruptcy 
in a related development american home products corp is 
proposing to take over robins for 3 billion 
the emergency 15 million fund that is the subject of todays 
supreme court action was opposed by owners of robins stock on nov 
3 the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled in the stockholders 
favor 
the appeals court said the federal bankruptcy code prohibits 
creation of the emergency fund because it would give preferential 
treatment to some with claims against robins the money cannot be 
spent while reorganization of the company is pending in bankruptcy 
proceedings the appeals court said 
in the case involving aetna federal lawsuits were filed in 
kansas and new hampshire by thousands of women seeking damages from 
the insurance company 
they said aetna was at fault because robins delegated to it 
responsibility for monitoring the performance of the dalkon shield 
and deciding whether it should be recalled the women also accused 
aetna of covering up evidence that the devices were defective 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in september blocked the 
lawsuits at least until the bankruptcy proceedings are concluded 
the appeals court said inevitably aetna must involve robins 
in this litigation aetnas primary defense logically will be that 
robins not aetna is responsible for the injuries suffered 
the appeals court continued robins will inexorably be drawn 
into this litigation and it will detract from the 
bankruptcy process 
the cases are mabey vs official committee of equity security 
holders 871267 and oberg vs aetna 871208

new york ap four people were arrested today in the beating 
death of a man who was chased and attacked by an angry mob after he 
snatched 20 from a woman in a bakery police said 
residents of nearby buildings watching the chase from their 
windows yelled encouragement as the man was pummeled sunday 
reflecting their growing hostility to the street crime and crack 
dealers in the neighborhood police said 
the crowd of more than a dozen people used sticks and their bare 
hands to beat the man identified by police as raymondo carraballo 
41 of manhattan one man grabbed a garbage can and banged it down 
on the mans chest as he lay on the sidewalk and then others used 
the can to hit him again and again said sgt ed burns a police 
spokesman 
police have ruled the death a homicide sgt john clifford a 
police spokesman refused to provide the names of the four suspects 
or any other information 
two housing authority police officers rescued carraballo and 
took him to housing authority headquarters burns said 
from there an ambulance took carraballo to mount sinai hospital 
where he lost consciousness and died sunday evening burns said an 
autopsy was scheduled 
the beating took place in front of the jefferson houses a 
public housing project in the east harlem section around the corner 
from the capri bakery where the suspect grabbed 20 from 
21yearold anna beteran burns said 
as carraballo ran out of the store beteran and her unidentified 
sisterinlaw chased him and yelled at a group of passersby that 
he had stolen her money 
the crowd chased carraballo and caught him around the corner 
between 15 and 20 people joined the pursuit but it was unclear how 
many actually took part in the beating burns said 
burns said carraballo had no previous criminal record but 
apparently was a drug addict his arms were covered with needle 
tracks he said 
police said several people had been questioned but no arrests 
had been made and no weapons recovered 
at this point we dont have any of the weapons but we know by 
the comments on the 911 calls for help that many forms of weapons 
were used burns said

the irish republican army shot 
dead a policeman today two days after a mob at an ira funeral 
killed two british soldiers 
police said the policeman was shot in the head in a jeep in the 
roman catholic creggan district of londonderry and died at a 
hospital 
the ira claimed responsibility in a clandestine message to 
belfast media 
the officer whose name was not made public immediately was the 
23rd person and the second policeman to die in the british province 
this year 
police sources said today about 30 suspects were being sought in 
connection with the mob attack saturday on two british soldiers 
the outlawed ira also claimed responsiblity for the killings of the 
soldiers 
irish and british newspapers said a police roundup of suspects 
in catholic strongholds in belfast was imminent 
police made no formal statement but the sources requesting 
anonymity said suspects were identified by studying videotape of 
saturdays rampage in which the two soldiers were beatend and 
stripped naked by the crowd and shot by ira gunmen 
three suspects were arrested immediately after the killings 
in the catholic markets district of west belfast police seized 
600 pounds of explosive material early today and said they 
arrested a woman 
in london northern ireland secretary tom king announced today 
an immediate review of its new policy of not policing irish 
republican army funerals following the killings saturday 
in all five people died during burials or funeral corteges in a 
fourday period last week 
king said a massive murder investigation is under way in the 
soldiers deaths 
concerning the search for the killers of the soldiers a 
statement by the royal ulster constabulary the northern ireland 
police force said only that inquiries are being actively 
pursued 
but police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
about 30 suspects were identified after officers scrutinized film 
of the slayings 
the british army said sunday the two soldiers had ignored 
general orders to stay away from the irish republican army funeral 
procession 
the mens commanding officer in belfast lt col martin 
roberts said in a radio interview today that the men must have 
driven into the area by mistake 
obviously the soldiers drove into the funeral cortege by 
mistake and tried to escape and in the process they were hemmed in 
by the black taxis said roberts who is commander of the armys 
communications in northern ireland 
an army helicopter assigned to film the funeral in catholic west 
belfast hovered overhead as corporals derek wood 24 and david 
howes 23 were killed king flew to belfast on sunday for 
briefings from army and police chiefs and was shown the 
helicopters film of the attack 
ulster unionist leader james molyneaux claimed the two soldiers 
were sacrificed to the new policy of not policing ira funerals 
while 500 members of the security forces were on standby in the 
city 
the rev ian paisley leader of the democratic unionist party 
also blamed the soldiers slayings on the new policy he called on 
king and the police chief sir john hermon to resign 
but conservative lawmaker michael mates said scrapping the new 
policy could mean more violence a return to heavyhanded 
policing could provoke riots which is what the ira want so they 
can say to the world they wont even let us bury our dead in 
peace he said 
the mainly catholic ira wants to drive the british from northern 
ireland and unite the predominantly protestant province with the 
overwhelmingly catholic irish republic 
on wednesday as security forces stayed away from belfasts 
milltown cemetery for the funerals of three ira members slain by 
british forces in gibraltar a protestant gunman killed three 
mourners and wounded 68 with grenades and bullets 
the two soldiers slain saturday interrupted the funeral of kevin 
brady 20 one of the three killed in milltown cemetery 
a statement from the ira which said its members shot the 
soldiers after identifying them said the mourners thought they 
were being attacked when the soldiers car sped toward them 
sinn fein the iras legal political wing blamed the british 
government for the violence and praised those who beat the soldiers 
for their bravery in protecting the cortege from attack

george bush picked up the endorsement of new 
jersey gov thomas h kean today while democrat albert gore jr 
got kind words but no endorsement from new york gov mario cuomo 
and richard gephardt got the same from chrysler chairman lee 
iacocca 
the meetings came one day after bush swept to his 23rd 
primaryseason victory in puerto rico and after democrats michael 
dukakis and jesse jackson recorded good weekend showings in kansas 
texas and puerto rico 
most of the democrats were campaigning today in michigan where 
caucuses saturday offer the next big delegate prize of the season 
while bush flew to new jersey for a rally 
in meetings today with wellknown noncandidates 
kean endorsed bush in new jersey saying as bush stood 
alongside him at a rally we need a president who doesnt 
apologize for whats wrong with america but who brags about whats 
right we need a president who doesnt have his eyes fastened on 
the failings of the past but who gazes steadily at the 
opportunities of the future 
cuomo said in albany ny said hed had an excellent and 
interesting meeting with gore but he told reporters he is 
still not ready to endorse a democratic presidential hopeful the 
endorsements dont mean a great deal cuomo said 
in michigan iacocca said dick gephardts a good friend of 
mine and he knows what hes talking about on trade but he made 
no endorsement and said he also was looking forward to meeting with 
other presidential candidates 
gephardt led the democratic parade into michigan talking with 
auto executives and steel workers as he works for the victory he 
must have here to rescue his campaign 
what does it profit this nation to conquer grenada if we are 
losing the auto industries of pontiac flint and detroit the 
missouri congressman told michigan democrats over the weekend 
wisconsin looks like the next major battleground for the 
republicans after bush won his latest victory in the puerto rico 
primary on sunday the vice president won with ease over sen bob 
dole who admitted that he has done little to slow down bushs 
drive for the gop nomination 
i still have a lot of supporters out there dole said in 
milwaukee we want them to know bob dole is a fighter that were 
going to stay in this race ive got a lot of hill to climb 
before april 5 and the wisconsin primary where polls give bush a 
big lead 
bush picked up the 14 delegates at stake in puerto rico 
boosting his total to 788 thats nearly 70 percent of the 1139 he 
needs to win at the national convention in new orleans this summer 
dole who hasnt won an event since feb 23 has only 178 former 
television evangelist pat robertson had 17 
in puerto rico jackson won the nonbinding preference poll with 
dukakis running second and simon third but it was a fight more 
about local matters than presidential politics 
the 51 delegates from puerto rico all ran as uncommitted and 
the campaigns promised major efforts to woo them in coming weeks 
dukakis won the kansas caucuses on saturday picking up 16 
delegates but jackson rode strong urban support into a surprising 
second place and 14 delegates 
its the first farm and agriculture state that ive won and 
won decisively dukakis said at a dinner in detroit on saturday 
night i think thats a very good sign for the future now 
were on to michigan and here we are 
in texas jackson appeared to do better splitting the delegates 
there in county conventions that were the next step in allocated 
atlarge delegates for the state that gave jackson a onedelegate 
edge over dukakis in the texas national delegate count including 
both the primary and caucus results but more complete returns 
could change that 
in south dakota a saturday caucus followed the results of the 
feb 23 primary and gave rep richard gephardt of missouri the no 
1 spot in state delegates 
all that activity left the latest ap delegate count this way 
dukakis 5265 jackson 50855 sen albert gore jr of tennessee 
3628 sen paul simon of illinois 1715 and gephardt 154 of 
those chosen 34365 were uncommitted to nominate 2082 delegates 
are needed 
michigans saturday caucuses offer 138 to be divided up and a 
weekend poll suggested dukakis and jackson were far ahead in that 
battle as well 
a detroit news survey of 38 likely caucusgoers gave the 
massachusetts governor 33 percent and jackson 30 percent a 
virtual tie gephardt had 14 percent in the survey conducted march 
1517 with the others trailing 
dukakis and gore sounded the traditional party themes in 
michigan where auto industry troubles have thrown thousands out of 
work 
were not going to sit on the sidelines while our neighbors 
are thrown out of work and americas hometowns are boarded up and 
left to die dukakis told the party dinner in detroit on saturday 
gore emphasized that im a friend of organized labor and 
always will be i believe it is time to put the white house back on 
the side of working men and women 
simon who is looking to wisconsin for victory admitted that 
id be fooling you if i said we expected to win in michigan as 
he campaigned through the state

more than 1 million color televisions one of 
chinas hottest consumer items lie unwatched in warehouses partly 
because suppliers use them for barter and influence it was 
reported monday 
there were more than 900 cases of illegal trade involving 
400000 color tvs last year said the china daily quoting a report 
in the gongren ribao workers daily 
the nation made 67 million color sets last year 62 percent 
more than in 1986 however about onesixth of them were in 
warehouses despite heavy consumer demand the report said 
the newspaper blamed part of the problem on poor distribution 
it also decried unsound tendencies among suppliers and 
distributors who hoard the sets the newspaper said color sets 
have acquired a kind of bargaining power and can be used to 
obtain favors 
the director of one tv factory reportedly obtained steel only 
after giving sets to suppliers some supply departments used sets 
as leverage to gain other bestselling products and unload 
unpopular ones the newspaper said

leg a wooden box containing a surfacetoair missile

military magazine 
the missiles were intact and had never been used the 
magazine quoted capt mike mandiringa commander of the search 
party as saying if it were not for the donkey they would still 
be in the water

war ended he said 
guerrillas fighting the white minority government of ian smith

angry poultry farmers threw live chickens 
and eggs at a us diplomatic office monday during a protest of 
imported american turkeys 
the 3000 farmers also took their protest to the bureau of 
foreign trade where they pelted a senior government official with 
eggs 
during the demonstration outside the american institute in 
taiwan farmers shouted we dont want us turkeys 
one protester cried out slogans are useless and the 
farmers threw 30 live chickens and dozens of eggs into the 
institute compound visa applicants reporters and policemen 
outside the building also were hit by the eggs 
farmers argue that chicken prices have fallen more than 50 
percent in five months because the united states has made taiwan a 
dumping ground for turkeys 
they gave a petition to officials at the institute which 
handles diplomatic matters between the united states and taiwan in 
the absence of formal relations 
the protesters then went to the bureau of foreign trade and 
threw eggs at vincent siew the bureaus director general when he 
spoke with the farmers but failed to promise an immediate ban on 
turkey imports 
siew told demonstrators that allowing us turkey imports was 
part of a plan to help reduce taiwans huge trade surplus with the 
united states which taipei said reached 16 billion last year 
taiwan officials want to lower the surplus to reduce us 
protectionist sentiment 
siew spoke to the farmers in a gynmasium near the bureau office 
but had to leave under riot police escort as farmers yelled step 
down vincent siew the demonstrators dispersed four hours after 
the protest began 
siew is a member of the taiwanus trade committee which 
recommended easing restrictions on us turkey imports the cabinet 
still must approve the decision 
the american institute in taiwan said us turkeys accounted for 
less than 1 percent of taiwans poultry market and did not hurt 
local farmers it said the price slump was caused by overproduction 
and inadequate distribution and marketing 
demonstration leader chen tungfang president of taiwans 
poultry association argued that chicken farmers have suffered an 
average monthly loss of 21 million since us turkey imports 
increased in november 
agriculture council officials said taiwan imported 2261 metric 
tons of turkeys from the united states last year up 142 percent 
from a year earlier 
an earlier demonstration was held wednesday when about 5000 
fruit and poultry farmers marched through taipei streets to protest 
the government decision to import turkeys and more fruit from the 
united states

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
making it easier for people to use a federal antiracketeering law 
to sue businesses 
the court said it will hear an appeal by phone customers in 
minnesota who have accused northwestern bell telephone co of 
trying to bribe state public utility officials 
the phone subcribers sued the company under a law known as the 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
they said the company beginning in 1980 tried illegally to win 
rate increases by offering gifts employment offers tickets to 
sporting and cultural events and other favors to members of the 
minnesota public utilities commission 
the suit was thrown out by a federal judge and that ruling was 
upheld last september by the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court said the phone users failed to allege a 
continuing pattern of racketeering activity required to make a case 
under the rico act 
a single fraudulent effort or scheme is insufficient grounds 
for a suit the appeals court said it said the phone customers 
complaint alleges no more than a series of fraudulent acts 
committed in furtherance of a single scheme to influence the 
public utility commissioners 
the supreme court is being asked to pick between various 
theories of how difficult it should be to maintain such a lawsuit 
the most expansive view would permit a rico suit when there are 
two related acts in furtherance of a single episode or a scheme 
a more restrictive view would be that a pattern of racketeering 
activity exists only when there are multiple separate criminal 
schemes or episodes 
those suing northwestern bell said there also is a middle road 
that would permit such suits based on an analysis of various 
factors including the number and variety of alleged illegal acts 
the number of victims the length of time of the activity and the 
number of participants in the alleged scheme 
they said the 8th circuit court ruling conflicts with decision 
by a number of other federal appeals courts 
the case is hj inc vs northwestern bell 871252

an old print that has adorned a wall 
in a painters cottage for decades is a genuine rembrandt etching 
worth about 53500 an art expert said monday 
the 1626 print titled jesus circumcision in the temple is 
the fifth known copy of the etching said theo lorentzius who 
examined the artwork 
the print which measures 8 inches by 5 inches also was 
examined by experts of amsterdams rijksmuseum a center of 
rembrandt learning 
the owner painter evert musch said he bought it about 40 years 
ago from an art dealer in groningen a city 16 miles north of this 
village in the northeastern netherlands he didnt recall what he 
paid for it 
ive always believed that the print was a genuine rembrandt

the supreme court agreeing to decide an 
important issue for all lawsuits alleging age bias in employment 
said today it will study the case of a laidoff pennsylvania man 
the justices agreed to decide whether eugene f briecks lawsuit 
against his former employer harbisonwalker refractories should 
proceed to a jury trial 
harbisonwalker a division of dresser industries sells 
specialized ceramic brick products primarily to steel producers 
brieck worked as an installation specialist for harbisonwalker 
from 1965 to 1982 
in july 1982 several employees of harbisonwalkers iron and 
steel marketing support group were laid off including brieck he 
then was 55 
brieck sued harbisonwalker in pittsburgh in 1984 contending 
that he was laid off and not recalled to work because of his age 
his lawsuit pointed to a 39yearold installation specialist with 
less seniority who was not laid off until november 1982 and then 
recalled eight months later 
lawyers for harbisonwalker contended that the other employee 
hugh faust was retained because of his more diverse work 
experience 
but brieck alleged that such diverse capabilities played a very 
small role in the job faust performed 
us district judge gerald j weber threw out briecks suit 
ruling that harbisonwalker had articulated legitimate 
nondiscriminatory business reasons for laying off brieck while 
retaining a younger man with less seniority 
but the 3rd us circuit court of appeals reinstated briecks 
suit last june 19 
the appeals court ruled that an employer charged with violating 
the federal age discrimination in employment act cannot avoid trial 
by articulating legitimate business reasons if the suing employee 
presents a reasonable inference that the employer proffered 
explanation is unworthy of credence 
the appeals court added the question is not whether the 
employers asserted reason is plausible but whether there is also 
evidence of record which if credited could render the reason 
implausible 
in seeking supreme court review lawyers for harbisonwalker 
argued that the appeals court ruling virtually eliminates summary 
pretrial judgment in employment discrimination cases 
the case is harbisonwalker vs brieck 87271

vice president george bush won 
puerto ricos republican primary and added 14 more national 
convention delegates to his tally while jesse jackson won the 
democrats nonbinding beauty contest balloting 
with 35 percent of the precincts reporting bush picked up 98 
percent of sundays vote gop rival sen bob dole of kansas had 
received just 2 percent 
bush had an overwhelming 1935 votes compared to just 48 for 
dole in ballots that had been tallied bush has the 14 
delegates said local gop chairman luis ferre 
the vast majority of puerto ricans chose to vote in the 
democratic primary with 91 percent of the precincts reporting 
jackson led with 87757 votes or 32 percent followed by 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis with 70733 for 26 percent 
illinois sen paul simon was third with 57639 votes or 21 
percent tennessee sen albert gore jr had 45361 for 17 percent 
and missouri rep richard gephardt had received 9159 or 3 percent 
of the votes 
the democratic primary had no effect on the candidates delegate 
totals for the democratic national convention next july in atlanta 
the 33 delegates at stake sunday who will choose another 18 
delegates have said they will go uncommitted to the convention 
in all puerto rico will send 56 delegates to the convention 
including gov raphael hernandez colon and four other party leaders 
who automatically receive delegate seats leaders say the 
delegation intends to vote as a bloc 
puerto ricos two main political parties hernandez colons 
popular democratic party and the outofpower new progressive 
party predicted that 1 million voters would cast ballots new 
progressives in general favor statehood for puerto rico while 
popular democrats do not 
the turnout was less than half what was expected possibily 
because the system approved by the state election commission 
required voters to register beginning at 9 am but prohibited them 
from voting until after 2 pm the system was set up to prevent 
double voting 
in 1980 the republican presidential primary was held two weeks 
before the democratic primary new progressive party voters cast 
ballots first for george bush a longtime proponent of statehood 
for puerto rico and then for jimmy carter the popular democratic 
party supported massachusetts sen edward m kennedy eight years 
ago 
gop chairman ferre said many republicans probably did not vote 
because of the confusion caused by dole backers who tried to call 
off the primary and choose delegates instead by caucus the issue 
was not settled until two days before the primary when a superior 
court judge ruled it must be held 
in preliminary figures released shortly after noon the 
commission reported the pdp slate ahead of the npp slate by 373950 
votes to 297408 with most of the 1650 polling stations 
tabulated a total of 671358 valid votes were counted 
pdp officials claimed they won at least 29 democratic convention 
delegate seats and perhaps all 33 that were at stake 
what we have seen in these primaries is a prelude of what will 
happen in november when the two parties meet again in 
gubernatorial elections said hernandez colon who is running for 
reelection 
the victory touched off pdp celebrations that included 
fireworks speeches and a merengue band at party headquarters and 
a caravan that wound its way horns tooting and loudspeakers 
blaring through the old san juan and puerta de tierra sections of 
the capital at 2 am 
ex gov carlos romero barcelo who headed the npp slate 
conceded his delegates lost but said we are not defeated the 
defeated dont continue to fight and we are in a fight against the 
pdp from today on 
romero barcelo faces a primary on june 12 against san juan mayor 
baltasar corrada del rio for the npp nomination for governor 
losing sunday may have weakened his standing in the party 
aside from a test of strength between hernandez colon and romero 
barcelo at issue was control of the local democratic party whose 
leaders will be chosen by the 33 delegates elected sunday 
the npp wants puerto rico to become the 51st us state the pdp 
wants things to remain as they are with puerto ricans as us 
citizens with almost every right and obligation except they cannot 
vote for president in the general election and do not pay federal 
taxes 
anticipating trouble between the rival parties the police 
department canceled days off and vacations and stationed 3000 
officers at or near polling stations and party offices the sale of 
alcoholic beverages was prohibited from midnight saturday to sunday 
night 
there were no reports of violence

the defection of a high east german transport official who 
apparently led authorities to her 
she was the chief secretary to volkmar koehler no 2 man in the 
economic cooperation ministry until 1987 and later moved to the 
ministrys european section officials reported

stopped spying at that time and destroyed her equipment but 
ignored urgings by communist contacts to flee to the east he said 
he said ms falk was paid about 11760 for the information she 
delivered

represented the most serious security breach since the arrest of

brandt was forced to resign as chancellor in 1974 after 
guillaume was exposed as a spy 
in the last major west german spy scandal 15 communist agents

american soldiers engaged in military maneuvers sunday at a 
honduran airstrip just 20 miles from the nicaraguan border but 
us officials said the threat from sandinista troops had subsided 
and combat appeared unlikely 
president reagan sent 3200 us military personnel to 
noncombat areas in honduras last week after the central american 
nation reported that nicaraguan forces had crossed its border to 
raid bases of usbacked nicaraguan rebels 
lt gen colin powell the us national security adviser said 
in washington the us military exercises should be completed 
shortly and the troops will return to the united states

million proposal for aid to the contras that was advanced by a 
bipartisan group of senators

the first ceasefire talks held inside nicaragua 
nicargua announced that it would suspend military operations for 
the duration of the talks 
on sunday deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco reiterated 
a previous sandinista position that the negotiations strictly deal 
with the mechanics of a ceasefire rebel leaders said the talks 
must also focus on democratization of nicaragua and free 
elections 
earlier nicaragua formally protested a honduran bombing raid on 
sandinista positions saturday as an unwarranted act of aggression 
it has denied that its troops crossed the junglechoked border 
dividing the nations

president jose azcona hoyo on sunday said nicaraguan troops are 
retreating from honduras and the us soldiers probably wont be 
needed much longer

positions was carried out because about 600 nicaraguan troops were 
moving too slowly from a section of the bocay area that honduras 
considers its territory

congress should order american troops and 
military installations pulled out of japan unless the japanese do 
much more to pay for western defense sen ted stevens said monday 
stevens said that because of the strength of the japanese 
economy and its favorable trade balance with the unite states 
tokyo should be able to foot the bill for its own defense 
the yen has conquered a great portion of american the 
alaska republican told a group of pentagon officials during a 
hearing of the senate appropriations military construction 
subcommittee now that the japanese economy is going full tilt 
japan should pay the full cost of keeping us troops and 
facilities in that nation stevens said 
stevens said he was putting the pentagon on notice that he 
plans to offer a bill next year that would require us military 
withdrawals from japan 
stevens said his proposal would be similar to legislation which 
was routinely sponsored and just as routinely defeated by 
former sen mike mansfield dmont calling for us troops to be 
withdrawn from europe mansfield is now us ambassador to japan 
mansfield was right stevens said 
the united states has been pressuring japan to increase defense 
spending and take more responsibility for its defense those calls 
have been particularly loud on capitol hill where japan has come 
under increasing criticism for its trade policies 
in tokyo prime minister noboru takeshita said monday that 
japans military power should match its economic strength 
japan last year formally scrapped a decadeold ceiling which 
limited defense spending to 1 percent of its gross national 
product during the current 198690 defense buildup plan the 
government says japans defense spending will total 11987 billion 
japan pays about 40 percent of the 59 billion cost of 
maintaining us facilities in the country 
richard armitage assistant secretary of defense for 
international security affairs told stevens that congress 
shouldnt engage in japanbashing 
japan is increasing its defense budget armitage said and the 
spending total is on the verge of passing the british french 
and west german defense budgets 
we should look beyond the popular allybashing rhetoric of a 
campaign year armitage said 
stevens responded that he would have offered his proposal this 
year but it shouldnt be an electionyear issue 
japan is now meeting all its mutually agreed defense goals 
armitage said and is building up its naval fleet 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the subcommittee told 
armitage that this burdensharing issue is not going to go 
away the congressional criticism is the reflection of a deeply 
felt concern among the american people that us allies should do 
more 
on other matters sasser said there are good signs that nato 
will come up with a new home probably italy for the 401st 
tactical fighter wing in spain the spanish government earlier this 
year formally asked that the wings 72 f16s be removed from 
torrejon air base outside madrid 
congress has banned the spending of any us money to relocate 
the wing instead the cost will be picked up by nato

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
today the reagan administration is very encouraged by a new 
congressional plan to send aid to the contra rebels but said other 
suggestions were also welcome 
we anticipate signing on to a bill in the sense that we want 
a contra aid package and we are working to get the best one that 
we can get fitzwater told reporters i think something will be 
very forthcoming very soon 
the 48 million plan which would permit the delivery of as much 
as 25 million worth of previously authorized arms and ammunition 
was proposed friday by sen nancy kassebaum rkan and a 
bipartisan group of senators it came in the wake of president 
reagans decision to airlift more than 3100 us troops to 
honduras 
reagan dispatched the troops wednesday after nicaraguas leftist 
government mounted an offensive against contra rebels along the 
honduran border in his saturday radio address reagan blamed 
congress recent rejection of new aid for the contras for the 
sandinista push against the rebels 
asked if the administration objected to anything in the new 
proposal fitzwater said i would say overall that we are very 
encouraged by the kassebaum proposal but we want to be open to 
other suggestions as well 
he said the administration would hold talks with house speaker 
jim wright dtexas when the time is right discussions with 
other members would continue today he said but he refused to name 
the individuals 
asked if the administration believed there was a chance that 
military aid for the rebels would be approved the spokesman 
declined to comment 
the spokesman said the sandinista push against the contras had 
improved chances for such a package because it had changed 
minds on capitol hill 
events of the last week have left little to the imagination in 
terms of what president daniel ortega and the sandinistas are 
really up to fitzwater said 
secretary of state george shultz offering the administrations 
first comment on the contra aid proposal said sunday that it 
should go forward 
commenting on nbctvs meet the press he said the package 
was a little low on money but under study by the administration 
representatives from capitol hill differed today on whether the 
situation had improved chances for renewed contra aid 
senate intelligence committee chairman david boren dokla 
said on abctvs good morning america that the us show of 
strength had helped the situation 
boren said he was amazed that there hasnt already been more 
action in advancing the plan 
however rep lee hamilton dind a senior member of the house 
foreign affairs committee and an opponent of further military aid 
to the contras said today that a favorable vote in the house is 
much more problematic 
the events of last week probably enhanced the possibility of 
some kind of aid package moving forward hamilton said on the 
same abctv show but there are a lot of obstacles to overcome 
its very had to predict at this point 
but some in congress say the administration if it chooses to 
back a new contra aid request must confront doubts about the 
seriousness of the border clash and perhaps even a backlash in 
congress prompted by the sudden airlift of troops 
there is a very serious lack of full trust here which 
goes back many years said house majority leader thomas foley 
appearing on cnns newsmaker sunday 
reagans national security adviser lt gen colin powell 
denied sunday that he had misled congress when he briefed lawmakers 
wednesday he acknowledged however that he had failed to mention 
reagans decision in principle to send troops to honduras if 
president jose azcona requested them 
we did not go into the specific options because we did not 
want it all over the newspapers powell said during an appearance 
on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
the national security adviser said the fighting on the 
nicaraguanhonduran border was pretty much over and offered 
assurances that it was unlikely us troops would become involved 
the combat zone is rapidly disappearing as the sandinistas 
appear to withdraw and i dont think there is any reasonable 
likelihood that they would be anywhere near the combat zone 
powell said of the us troops

want to buy a milliondollar mansion with 
hardwood floors chandeliers and a spiral staircase a firm here 
will build you one on its assembly line and ship it to you in 
pieces on flatbed trucks 
its really an evolutionary thing for home building said 
george oswald treasurer of techno craft inc a 3yearold 
privately held company 
this business started with mobile homes went to doublewides 
and then twostory units we said thats all well and good but 
were going to go ahead of that said greg cunningham the 
companys founder and chief executive officer 
each twostory luxury home built by techno craft which began 
production last august has hardwood floors a spiral staircase 
chandeliers a fireplace jacuzzi bidet and imported tiles 
options include a steam room sauna and an elevator 
cunningham 35 started the techno craft in 1985 when another 
company he heads had trouble finding an adequate supply of upscale 
housing in the new york metropolitan area 
this is really the answer to the housing problem in this 
country modular housing and done right he said 
techno craft produced 100 homes on its assembly line last year 
and has orders this year for 450 he said 
oswald said the company will have to build another plant next 
year to meet demand he said they eventually want to make 1000 
homes a year for sale between maine and virginia and increase 
employment from 125 to 700 
nationally 51000 modular homes were produced last year up 
from 39000 in 1977 according to the 1988 edition of the red book 
of housing manufacturers modular homes accounted for 28 percent 
of the 185 million homes built in 1987 according to the book 
which based its findings on a survey of more than 500 companies 
john j smolke jr chief of pennsylvanias division of 
manufactured housing a state regulatory agency said a shortage of 
skilled labor and greater profit for the builder have helped the 
growth of the industry 
but he said the industry still has to overcome the image that 
prefabricated homes belong in the lowrent district 
when people think of something built in a plant they still 
envision the typical mobile home smolke said 
cunningham said building homes in a factory has advantages to 
building them on the lot 
homes built on site can take eight months to a year to build and 
are subject to vandalism and theft exposed to the weather and 
dependent on local labor he said 
techno crafts factorybuilt mansions take eight weeks from the 
start of construction to the day the homeowner can move in and 95 
percent of the work takes place in the factory cunningham said 
peter cornell president of cornell development corp in albany 
ny decided to have techno craft build 151 townhouses for a 
development near albany 
they are the only people who can do in the factory what i can 
with a real quality crew cornell said he said techno craft will 
do it at a lower cost 
in the 480footlong techno craft plant sections or modules of 
a house are assembled along an assembly line with 24 work stations 
floors and roofs are constructed at separate stations to the 
side of the assembly line and moved to the line by overhead cranes 
the finished sections are shipped from the plant in central 
pennsylvania on six flatbed trucks and can be assembled in a day 
after the sections are lifted onto a foundation with a crane and 
assembled siding is added and precut molding and carpeting is 
installed cunningham said 
oswald said modular homes from other builders require more 
construction after they are placed on their foundations 
it would take anybody else two or three years to get where we 
are and by that time well be way ahead he said

man who had declined to undergo testing until he was offered 1000 
you kind of start counting on things and then you have a big 
letdown said steven j chapman ive just made up my mind not 
to count on anything 
doctors said they were presenting other treatment options to 
chapman 31 of oolitic 
its would have been a very rough treatment said dr 
richard s fayssoux the hematology and oncology specialist who is 
treating chapman 
the patients brother randy chapman 32 who was located last 
month on the streets of miami initially refused to submit to tests 
if he dies he dies said randy chapman who earns his 
living as the subject of medical experiments 
randy chapman eventually accepted an indiana philanthropists 
offer of a 1000 testing incentive the brother who left home 16 
years ago would have received an additional 2000 had there been 
a match and subsequent transplant operation 
steven chapman said doctors were checking into a partial bone 
marrow match that was located through a national registry 
well come up with something else said chapman

a soviet official today charged that us 
negotiators are jeopardizing prospects of signing an accord to cut 
longrange nuclear weapons at the next superpower summit 
the remarks came in an interview of alexei a obukhov the 
soviets top arms negotiator published today in the communist 
party newspaper pravda they coincided with the first day of talks 
in washington between soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and us officials 
i have the impression that the americans began to hesitate and 
are not sure now whether it is worthwhile to have an agreement on 
strategic offensive arms ready by the designated date that is by 
the time ronald reagan visits moscow obukhov told pravda 
today the americans are slowing down the pace rather than 
increasing it 
shevardnadze and us secretary of state george p shultz have 
been holding monthly meetings to work out differences in a 200page 
treaty to cut longrange missiles by 50 percent 
president reagan has been expected to go to moscow later this 
spring on a date to be announced for his fourth meeting with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev both sides have said they would 
like to sign the treaty on strategic weapons at that time 
shultz said in moscow last february that the two sides had 
agreed to tell treaty negotiators to draft verification and other 
key elements by the time shevardnadze came to the united states he 
also said negotiators should speed up progess in order to ensure a 
treaty would be ready to sign at a moscow summit 
but obukhov said americans were dragging their feet with the 
idea of turning lack of progress against the soviets our 
partners think that with this kind of action they can spoil the 
term for working out the agreement and place the blame for this on 
us he said 
obukhov also said the reagan administrations position on the 
strategic defense initiative better known as star wars still 
stands in the way of an agreement the soviets say the program to 
deploy a space shield against nuclear attack violates the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty between the superpowers 
in a separate dispatch the official tass news agency said the 
us militaryindustrial complex has become wary of star wars 
because the programs cost may preclude spending on other types of 
military weapons 
the prospect of enormous funds being allocated for sdi at the 
expense of other military programs has caused obvious concern to 
individual members of the militaryindustrial complex who are 
beginning to see the star wars project as two birds in the bush 
that can make them lose the bird in hand tass said 
vladimir chernyshov the agencys military writer said the 
fifth anniversary of the strategic defense initiative is being 
widely celebrated in the united states although there is 
effectively nothing left of the sdi dream as conceived five years 
ago 
while then they were talking about an impregnable shield 
now they are talking about a first phase of an abm system with 
very limited capability chernyshov wrote 
however he said it would be a dangerous illusion to believe 
that because of opposition in congress and elsewhere star wars will 
soon be abandoned

police arrested 34 taxi drivers monday for 
violating antipollution rules that ban half of the capitals 
15000 taxis from the city center each day 
a spokesman for the cabbies said they intentionally entered the

the ban is part of a set of wideranging restrictions limiting 
traffic in athens the measures are aimed at dispelling an 
eyestinging brown smog that hangs over the city in calm weather 
the taxi drivers were arrested because they brought cabs with 
even licenseplate numbers into the 5squaremile central zone on a 
day reserved for oddnumbered vehicles said a spokesmen for the 
traffic police 
nikos stekas a spokesman for the athens taxi drivers union 
said cabbies will defy the ban every day claiming it cuts their 
income in half

police said they could also lose their operating permits for a 
month

state rep bill english takes along a 
portable television set and earplug when he goes to the house floor 
to vote 
other lawmakers cluster around a lobby television set or around 
tvs and radios in their offices so focused on them that house 
leaders sometimes need six quorum calls to transact business 
the house is virtually at a standstill with five members 
working as the board of managers for the senates impeachment trial 
of gov evan mecham and the 55 others fascinated by testimony that 
has included an alleged death threat sexual affairs political 
paybacks and the governor himself 
the trial entered its fourth week monday and the senate has 
considered only one of three charges against mecham a firstterm 
republican who is the first us governor to be impeached in six 
decades and the first ever in arizona 
many house committees canceled meetings last week for lack of 
bills the chairmen wanted to consider and the house moved to a 
threeday week beginning monday down from fourday work weeks 
the 30member senate meanwhile has scheduled night committee 
meetings in an effort to act on the relatively few key areas 
lawmakers want to address this session the budget taxes air 
pollution and indigent health care 
regular sessions are supposed to last 100 days which generally 
would mean ending in late april but pressure to close does not 
begin in earnest until per diem pay is cut in half after 110 days 
and stops altogether after 120 days 
lawmakers say the pace has been especially slow this year 
despite promises from the house republican leadership that things 
would start moving once the house finished preimpeachment hearings 
and sent the matter to the senate 
its not been a terribly productive year so far says house 
minority leader art hamilton a democrat from phoenix 
its the most difficult session ive seen in 16 years and it 
doesnt seem to be getting any better he added citing a lot 
more emotion than probably action 
republican leaders acknowledge that impeaching a fellow 
republican has taken its toll on party unity hamilton and others 
note the inaction on major bills and the concentration on issues 
such as a resolution telling congress that soviet troops should 
quit angola 
other committee chairmen meanwhile have continued to limit 
debate prompting a series of walkouts by democrats who complain 
that important bills are not being given a full hearing 
republican leaders say they have been trying to keep the session 
as normal as possible but hamilton said he thinks lawmakers should 
take advantage of the spare time to look indepth at issues such as 
taxes arizonas medicaid alternative and pollution which normally 
get resolved on a rush basis due to the press of other business 
but because most house members are watching the trial hamilton 
said the house is doing little other its normal work at a much 
slower pace 
its tough to compete with the soapopera draw of the 
impeachment trial 
mecham is charged with ordering the department of public safety 
director not to cooperate with an investigation of the alleged 
threat by a state official against a former mecham aide the aide 
was about to testify before a state grand jury on the governors 
unreported 350000 campaign loan 
mecham also is accused in the impeachment trial of concealing 
the loan and misusing 80000 in state funds by loaning the money 
to his auto dealership 
mecham has said he will be exonerated 
a twothirds vote of the senate is required to convict mecham 
and lawmakers also could bar him from public office mecham also 
faces an april 21 criminal trial on charges of concealing the 
campaign loan and a may 17 recall election

the state department today complained of 
massive soviet arms shipments to nicaragua as the war in the 
central american country cast a shadow over the visit of foreign 
minsiter eduard a shevardnadze even before he opened talks here 
charles e redman the department spokesman said the soviets 
shipped over 3000 tons of equipment to the sandinista government 
in january and february alone 
for a number of years the soviets have supplied nicaragua with 
500 million to 600 million in assistance annually he said i 
certainly dont see it as an issue heating up redman said but 
he said soviet military support is a continuing cause for 
concern 
in another development before shevardnadze opened talks with 
secretary of state george p shultz late in the day the white 
house confirmed that there could be two superpower summit meetings 
this year 
signing a treaty to sharply reduce strategic nuclear weapons 
this spring in moscow is our goal presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said 
we are hopeful but there is no guarantee that well have a 
start agreement ready to sign at the summit he said 
therefore fitzwater said reagan told the international herald 
tribune last friday in an interview that if there was an 
agreement later sure wed find some way to sign it 
while the administration complained about soviet military aid to 
nicaragua shevardnadze was bound to register moscows irritation 
over the dispatch of 3200 american troops to honduras 
we have quite a few problems the soviet foreign minister 
said on his arrival sunday for three days of talks with shultz and 
a session with president reagan at the white house he singled out 
the situation in central america as rather grave and of some 
serious concern to us 
also an impasse has developed in negotiations held in geneva 
under united nations auspices for the withdrawal of an estimated 
120000 soviet troops from afghanistan 
still the visit may produce a date for the next superpower 
summit speculation centers on late may in moscow and some 
progress toward a treaty to sharply reduce us and soviet 
longrange nuclear weapons 
the treaty is the projected centerpiece for reagans fourth 
meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev but negotiations 
in geneva have proceeded slowly 
its by no means in the bag shultz said sunday of the 
accord that would reduce by 30 percent to 50 percent the overall 
arsenals of us and soviet longrange bombers missiles and 
submarines 
its possible but were not going to try to have one just for 
the sake of a treaty shultz said on nbctv well only be 
willing to go forward the president will if its something we 
regard as good 
shevardnadze in a statement on his arrival at andrews air force 
base outside washington said he was optimistic about arranging 
reagans visit 
i think we will be able to decide about the date he said 
then added we have to work hard we have to work intently 
us and soviet negotiators have been working on drafts for the 
strategic arms reduction treaty one would deal with how nuclear 
weapons will be scrapped another with verifying compliance with 
the accord 
the two sides have exchanged drafts in the past month on how 
they would inspect each others missile sites and make sure 
cutbacks are carried out shultz and shevardnadze are also due to 
review the procedures for reducing nuclear arsenals 
the procedures are likely to follow the pattern of the treaty to 
ban intermediaterange nuclear missiles but verification is 
considered a more difficult problem since not all the longrange 
weapons would be scrapped 
shultz indicated strongly that reagan would go to moscow to see 
gorbachev with or without a treaty to sign 
i think it is important that summit meetings have content 
he said but its also true that we are now evolving into a 
process where perhaps they will come to be a little more normal 
there are plenty of things on our plate right now that could 
come to fruition other than the strategic arms treaty 
reagan in an interview published in the international herald 
tribune said he was willing to meet with gorbachev a second time 
this year if the negotiations for a strategic arms treaty could not 
be completed by the summit later this spring 
shevardnadze after resting from his long flight from moscow 
arranged for a late afternoon meeting with shultz today they will 
meet again on tuesday and wednesday his call on reagan at the 
white house tentatively is scheduled for wednesday 
shultz and shevardnadze have been meeting monthly to plan for 
the summit improving the human rights situation in the soviet 
union and soliciting soviet support for an international arms 
embargo against iran also are among the us goals 
in the meantime the wars in nicaragua and afghanistan 
underscore ussoviet rivalries 
guerrillas in both countries are fighting with us weapons 
against marxist governments equipped by the soviet union the 
reagan administration last week turned the heat up in central 
america by sending troops to honduras

a witness at gov evan mechams 
impeachment trial testified today that she was certain she told the 
governor of an investigation into an alleged death threat two days 
before he is accused of trying to hinder the probe 
peggy griffith director of the governors office of womens 
services told the senate i believed at the time he understood 
me 
mecham is accused of trying to thwart an investigation of the 
alleged threat and he testified last week that he did not recall 
mrs griffith telling him there was a probe 
mrs grifith also said today that her secretary terri fields 
complained that mecham and his attorney were hounding her about 
information on the alleged threat against another official 
mrs griffith quoted ms fields as saying they just keep 
asking me about the conversation you had with lee watkins who is 
accused of making the alleged threat 
mecham is charged with ordering department of public safety 
director ralph milstead not to cooperate with the attorney 
generals investigation of the alleged threat by watkins then head 
of state prison construction against former top mecham aide donna 
carlson 
it was mrs griffith who reported the threat and ms fields 
testified for the defense earlier in the trial in an effort to 
discredit mrs griffiths testimony ms fields said mrs griffith 
was sometimes forgetful and tended to exaggerate things 
defense attorney fred craft who crossexamined mrs griffith 
today asked if she had a total recall memory 
when i hear a death threat i do mrs griffith said 
she also said that during the first several days after the 
alleged threat occurred i felt very much like nobody believed 
what i was saying 
at the time of the alleged nov 12 threat ms carlson was about 
to testify before a state grand jury on the governors unreported 
350000 campaign loan 
the governors defense attorney fred craft also is expected to 
be called to the stand before testimony is completed on the count 
involving the death threat craft attended a crucial meeting at 
which mecham was told about the alleged threat 
mecham also is accused in the impeachment trial of concealing 
the loan and misusing 80000 in state funds by loaning the money 
to his auto dealership opening arguments were expected this week 
on the 80000 loan 
on sunday with his impeachment trial entering its fourth week 
and some rocky testimony behind him mecham said he is still 
convinced the senate will exonerate him 
with the world looking on as they have i cant see how any of 
them senators who have any claim of judging on the evidence can 
do anything but exonerate me mecham said 
mecham spent part of three days on the stand last week and 
contended he was the victim of an attempted mutiny by people in 
government including attorney general bob corbin and milstead 
but his effort to discredit the former head of his dps security 
detail lt beau johnson backfired friday when mecham admitted he 
lacked proof as he earlier testified that he had that johnson 
had stolen an unrelated report on the agency from the governors 
office 
johnson had reported the alleged death threat to mecham 
although the governor contends he was not adequately informed of 
the seriousness of the matter 
mecham testified that watkins told him he had been informed by 
johnsons supervisor lt col james chilcoat that johnson had 
taken the report 
however deputy dps director lt col gary phelps sparked 
applause and laughter from the gallery when he testified moments 
later that watkins in fact had taken the report which watkins 
denied 
mecham said sunday he thought he had not really been hurt by 
his admission that he lacked the proof he had claimed under oath 
that he had and he said he hadnt intended to make the claim 
against johnson 
i inadvertently used it when they were asking for a lot of 
things during his testimony mecham said 
mecham also said he believed watkins was telling the truth 
when he told me what chilcoat told him 
the defense also sought last week to discredit milstead with 
testimony on his sex life by a woman who claimed to be his former 
lover christina johnston she was not allowed to give specifics 
but said their relationship was intimate and personal and that 
she had been married only six times 
mecham said he had never met mrs johnston but that he was told 
by craft that she was a very decent honest person 
with the exception of milstead she marries men instead of 
just lives with them mecham said women who are vulnerable get 
taken advantage of by predatory men in this world 
mecham is the first us governor to be impeached in six decades 
and the first ever in arizona 
a twothirds vote of the 30member senate is required to convict 
mecham and lawmakers also could decide to bar him from future 
public office 
mecham also faces an april 21 criminal trial on charges of 
concealing the 350000 campaign loan and a may 17 recall election

five army pershing 2 missiles 
banned from deployment under a treaty with the soviets were 
testfired monday 
the unarmed missiles were successfully fired under battlefield 
conditions by nato troops normally based in west germany an army 
spokesman said the tests went off separately from 801 am to 
1153 am army officials said 
the pershings have been banned from use under an arms treaty 
signed dec 8 by president reagan and soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev but the treaty has not been ratified by the senate a 
move that could come in late spring

a supreme court justice monday criticized a 
denver lawyer over the fees he is charging as the courts special 
master in a case 
justice harry a blackmun dissenting from a court order 
granting charles j meyers 6966125 in interim fees complained 
about the hourly rates many large law firms charge their clients 
meyers a former dean of stanford law school is a partner in 
the denver office of the los angelesbased law firm of gibson dunn 
amp crutcher 
meyers in 1984 was appointed as special master in a 
stillpending dispute between texas and new mexico over use of 
pecos river water 
texas is being allowed to sue new mexico in the supreme 
court before the case has been heard by any lower court in such 
cases the justices invoke the courts original jurisdiction 
and hire a special master to conduct hearings and make 
recommendations 
the case in varying forms has been before the high court since 
1975 
meyers submitted bill of over 69000 represents work he and an 
associate of his law firm diana poole have devoted to the case 
since late 1986 
meyers bill to be paid by texas and new mexico reflects 
compensation averaging 27512 an hour for himself and 19130 for 
ms poole 
in his dissenting opinion blackmun notes that many of the 246 
hours ms poole spent working on the case represented getting 
herself familiar with the legal issues another associate in 
meyers law firm steven crafton had been assigned similar duties 
before leaving the firms denver office 
it seems apparent indeed meyers so concedes when he 
describes the nature of the early months of her work on the case 
that a substantial amount of ms pooles time was selfeducation 
and was duplicative background work already performed by 
crafton blackmun said 
the consequences of craftons departure hardly are to be 
charged to these litigants blackmun added 
he added it also is difficult for me to accept the fact that 
in denver colo this partners time is now worth 290 an hour 
having been increased from 265 on nov 1 1987 and that the time 
of ms poole is now worth 200 an hour having been elevated from 
170 beginning nov 1 1987 
it seems to me that establishment law firms are doing 
themselves and the public a disservice by asserting fees of this 
magnitude so persistently over dissents from the court 
public dissatisfaction with lawyers is not unknown neither is 
public distrust of lawyers a fee application of this kind tends to 
build that dissatisfaction and that distrust blackmun said 
the case is texas vs new mexico 65 original

safety experts previewed a series of new 
designs for childresistant pill containers monday to highlight 
this years national poison prevention week 
the special medicine containers have helped reduce the number of 
children fatally poisoned from nearly 500 in 1962 to 56 in 1985 
reported terrence m scanlon chairman of the federal consumer 
product safety commission 
marsha millonig of the national poison prevention week said 
resistant caps are one of the three main factors in reducing 
poisonings along with the growth of poison control centers and 
improved parental awareness of the dangers of poison for children 
and dr toby litovitz of the national capital poison control 
center at georgetowen university hospital stressed that even with 
the reduction in poisonings the danger to toddlers persists and 
merits continued vigilance 
while the special caps on medicine bottles and other products 
have helped reduce the toll on children scanlon conceded that many 
adults also have trouble with them 
hugh lockhart of michigan state university described several 
possible design changes that have been developed 
the currently popular design in which the cap from a pill 
bottle must be pressed down and turned to get it open requires 
some strength and determination he noted 
basically people are required to engage a series of lugs that 
they cannot see using a principle that they do not understand 
its no wonder theyve had trouble lockhart said 
one of the findings of the university researchers is that the 
physical strength of very old people may be no greater than than of 
a small child he said but the elderly generally retain manual 
dexterity and can handle problem solving better so those abilities 
were considered in designing new closures 
among the closures being tested he said are 
placing individual pills in a strong plastic blister with a 
peeloff backing 
designing a rigid plastic package with pills in individual 
blisters the package would fold in half with a childresistant 
latch holding it closed 
bottle caps similar to the current ones except with a slot 
that a key could be slid into to allow them to be turned to open 
another bottle cap with a hole in the side into which a pencil 
or other tool could be inserted to twist it open 
a somewhat easier to open version of the current caps which is 
lifted to open rather than being pressed down 
using inks in contrasting colors to make the directions and 
arrows stand out on caps expecially those on which arrows have to 
be lined up to get them open 
safety commission vice chairwoman carol dawson said the agency 
is arranging for test samples of the various designs to be made 
and expects to give them tryouts during the next year 
designs that are successful would be made available for 
manufacturers to copy at no charge she said 
some of the designs could be more costly than current 
childresistant caps although lockhard declined to speculate on 
the amount of the cost 
the closure manufacturers association meanwhile applauded the 
research effort and said its members are anxious to participate in 
the testing of the new designs

police moved in on a crowd of more than 500 
people demonstrating today against us military presence in 
central america arresting an estimated 225 protesters who tried to 
block the entrance to the federal building 
batonwielding officers began rounding up demonstrators after 
police capt william welch warned the crowd they were gathered 
illegally and ordered them to disperse 
demonstrators hurled newspaper vending boxes and other debris 
into the street trying to disrupt traffic and stay one step ahead 
of helmeted police 
shouts of no contra aid and us cia out of nicaragua 
filled the air as the demonstrators circled in front of the closed 
main entrance while early arrivals for work got in through another 
door 
but the crowd quickly moved to that entrance holding aloft a 
6footlong sign reading this building closed for renovation of 
morals 
some demonstrators tried disrupting traffic wandering in the 
path of cars and forcing them to swerve or stop in one instance a 
demonstrator fled leaving behind a small yellow scooter which an 
officer picked up and hurled into the gutter 
most of those arrested were cited for taking part in an illegal 
assembly

to know we are seriously committed to stopping us intervention in 
central america said bill nygren a spokesman for pledge of 
resistance one of several groups sponsoring the demonstrations

the senate finance committee flooded by 
complaints from farmers fishermen and mining companies voted 
monday to allow some sales of diesel fuel without the payment of 
tax 
the relief would be financed by doubling the tax on gasguzzling 
cars and closing a loophole that has allowed a handful of 
distilleries to dodge part of the liquor tax by watering down some 
of their booze 
because of the drive to reduce the budget deficit farmers and 
others who buy diesel for offroad use may not get their relief 
until oct 1 unless some bookkeeping trick can be found quickly 
they will have to pay the 151centagallon tax and then apply for 
a refund when they file their income tax returns next year 
but the prospect of delivering that message to farmers is not a 
happy one for lawmakers 
when we go back for recess easter week it will be about 
taxreturn filing time and it would be like us walking through a 
field of scorpions barefooted to have to tell farmers they face 
all that paperwork for another six months said sen david pryor 
dark 
with the creativity of the minds around here perhaps we can 
come up with a solution that will make the relief available on 
april 1 said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the committee chairman 
the committee is restrained by an agreement between congress and 
the reagan administration which requires that each dollar of tax 
relief be offset by a dollar of tax increase 
as part of the deficitreduction law passed last december 
farmers and other offtheroad diesel users are required to pay the 
tax beginning april 1 and then apply for a refund congress found 
there had been a considerable amount of evasion because of the 
difficulty in policing so many retail outlets the new law requires 
the tax be collected by wholesalers or producers 
farmers accused the government of trying to balance the budget 
on their backs contending there is no reason that washington 
should have interestfree use of their money an average of about 
320 per farmer per year for as much as 12 months similar 
complaints have come from timber companies mine operators 
fishermen and oil drillers 
the finance committee put together this package which is 
subject to approval in the senate and house 
to allow all diesel bought for any offroad use from 
wholesalers to escape the tax altogether taxexempt buyers of 
offroad diesel from retailers would have to pay the tax and get a 
refund next year this would cost the government 543 million 
through 1993 
to approve a taxpayer bill of rights which would clamp 
down on what are perceived to be abuses of taxpayers by the 
internal revenue service this would lose 517 million over five 
years due chiefly to a drop in compliance 
to extend through june 30 1989 the expiring authority for the 
irs to withhold tax refunds from people who owe student loans farm 
loans and other federal debts this would raise about 400 million 
to double the tax on new cars whose fuel efficiency does not 
meet federal standards raising 375 million through 1993 in the 
current model year the tax hits only expensive foreign cars such 
as the 138850 lamborghini countach which gets 88 miles per 
gallon and is subject to a 3850 levy and the bmw 750 which gets 
164 mpg and faces a 1500 gasguzzler tax those taxes would rise 
to 7700 and 3000 respectively 
to limit use of a wine flavors credit under which some 
manufacturers of distilled spirits avoid a significant share of the 
1250agallon liquor tax by mixing some products with a 
grapebased alcohol this is expected to raise 360 million over 
five years 
the committees bill does nothing about a 1986 law also aimed 
at tax evaders that requires about 82000 state city and county 
government units to pay taxes of 91 cents a gallon on their 
gasoline and apply later for a refund that provision took effect

government regulators around the 
world require too many long and costly tests to determine whether 
new synthetic chemicals are cancer hazards two experts said monday 
a few relatively quick tests can identify the class of chemicals 
that form the greatest hazard and new tests may have to be devised 
for the rest they said at a science writers seminar sponsored by 
the american cancer society 
nobody knows how to register a chemical thats safe around the 
world because so many tests are required including those that do 
not really tell how hazardous a chemical would be for humans said 
john ashby of the central toxicology laboratory of ici ltd a 
chemical company in chesire england 
a limited number of shortterm tests will correctly identify 
chemicals that can cause genetic mutations which have the highest 
chance of causing cancer in humans he said 
one major test called the ames test looks for genetic changes 
in bacteria called salmonella another compares the molecular 
structure of a new chemical to those that have proven 
cancercausing in the past he said 
such tests will overlook chemicals that cause cancer without 
damaging genes and which apparently affect the natural mutation 
rate of genes he said new tests in animals will probably be 
needed to find those he said 
currently some regulators require highdose tests in mice and 
rats that run two or three years and chemicals are labeled 
cancercausing even if they cause only specific tumors in 
particular sexes of rodents he said 
no chemical with such limited effects has been shown to cause 
cancer in people he said such chemicals are far less likely to 
cause cancer in humans exposed to low dose levels than one shown to 
damage genes and cause cancer in a range of tissues in several 
rodent species he said 
saccharin is one example of a chemical with only limited effect 
in animals that should not be considered a carcinogen for people 
he said 
vincent devita head of the national cancer institute said he 
thought the labeling of saccharin as a carcinogen was 
overblown making for confusing comparisons with such cancer 
dangers as cigarette smoke 
the theme of excessive testing was echoed by the second expert 
on chemicals michael shelby of the national institute of 
environmental health sciences 
he said that of 23 chemicals or chemical combinations on a 
standard list of cancer hazards 20 score positive on the ames test 
or another shortterm test that checks for genetic damage in bone 
marrow of rodents 
another would probably score positive he said the remaining 
two are asbestos fibers and a form of estrogen so when new 
substances that resemble either of those come up for testing they 
should get special consideration he said

at least six guards at a nazi death camp 
resembled a retired ohio autoworker accused of war crimes who 
claims he is a victim of mistaken identity his lawyer said monday 
at a special evidentiary session 
john demjanjuks attorney said the new evidence casts doubt on 
the testimony of five survivors of the camp who identified his 
client as a guard known as ivan the terrible 
attorney yoram sheftel was speaking to a special session of a 
threejudge panel at demjanjuks trial in jerusalem the yearlong 
trial ended feb 16 and judges were considering a verdict when 
they agreed to permit the defense to offer the new documents 
submitted last week 
sheftel also argued that part of the evidence used to bring 
demjanjuk to trial was forged and thus throws the prosecutions 
case into question he said the 1979 testimony of a soviet citizen 
who said demjanjuk was a guard at the sobibor death camp was 
concocted to frame his client 
you cannot by any stretch of the imagination be in two places 
at one time in both treblinka and sobibor sheftel said 
demjanjuk 67 is charged with operating the gas chambers that 
killed 850000 jews at treblinka in nazioccupied poland in 1942 
and 1943 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk who settled in the cleveland area 
after world war ii says he was set up by the soviet union he says 
the soviets wanted to hurt him because he had fought in an 
anticommunist army unit organized by the germans during world war 
ii 
the new evidence for his defense includes 12 statements from 
treblinka inmates who failed to identify demjanjuk as ivan from two 
photographs of the autoworker in an eightpicture lineup three 
others pointed to the two pictures but identified them as six 
different nazi guards sheftel said 
sheftel said the 1979 statement came from a soviet citizen named 
it danilchenko he said the document was contrived to lend 
credence to a key piece of prosecution evidence demjanjuks 
purported nazi id card provided by the soviet union to israel 
i dont know whether danilchenko is alive or whether there 
even is such a person sheftel said 
the prosecutor dismissed the defenses claims i fail to see 
how any of this helps the defense said prosecutor michael 
shaked all this proves to the court is that there were quite a 
number of survivors who pointed to demjanjuks picture as being 
familiar to them 
he said the importance of the soviet citizens statement was nil 
demjanjuk sat impassively during the eighthour session 
occasionally yawning 
a federal judge in washington ordered the us justice 
department to release the new evidence last month after the 
demjanjuk family filed a request under the freedom of information 
act

a federal magistrate denied a prisoners 
request for materials to worship satan ruling that satanism is not 
a religion and the knitting needles he wanted for bloodletting 
would pose a security risk 
holman prison inmate charles mccorkle had filed a lawsuit 
against state officials claiming he was prevented from practicing 
satanism at the maximumsecurity prison 
besides asking for the satanic bible and other books on the 
occult mccorkle asked for knitting needles to draw blood for his 
rituals 
us magistrate william cassady ruled earlier this month that 
satanism is an unreligion instead of a religion 
it is a philosophy of life that rejects all religions and 
promotes the idea that man should not be subservient to any natural 
or supernatural being cassady ruled 
if mccorkles requests were granted the magistrate ruled he 
would create a severe security risk to prison officials and other 
inmates 
mccorkles suit earlier was dismissed as frivolous but the 11th 
us circuit court of appeals in atlanta ordered a hearing on the 
claim which prompted cassadys review 
in his 11page recommendation the magistrate said mccorkle has 
a history of psychiatric disorders has attempted suicide by 
slashing his wrists and has admitted to a previous addiction to 
numerous drugs including heroin 
assistant attorney general david christy who defended the 
prison system applauded cassadys decision 
this is the first time ive seen where a judge held 
unequivocably satanism is not a religion christy said 
mccorkle is serving a 40year sentence on three separate 
burglary convictions he claimed if he had the proper reading 
materials and articles needed for his rituals he could practice 
magic and gain mental and physical prowess over others including 
prison officials and could curse others even to the point of 
death

the state department on monday hailed el 
salvadors national elections calling them a strong victory for 
the democratic process in that country 
department spokesman charles redman said some experienced 
observers described sundays balloting as being the most well run 
and secure of the five elections held in el salvador since 
democracy was restored in 1982 
there was virtually no evidence of election fraud or 
preelection violence by any of the contending parties redman 
said 
the strong turnout apparently around 70 percent in the face 
of a concerted guerrilla campaign of terrorism and intimidation 
should make it clear that the vast majority of the salvadoran 
people reject the revolutionary violence and rhetoric of the 
communist guerrillas he said 
the election produced sizable gains by a rightist party one of 
whose leaders roberto daubuisson has been denied a us visa 
from time to time because of his alleged association with death 
squad groups 
redman was asked whether the united states had any reservations 
about the outcome of the elections 
our basic policy is that we dont choose sides in these kinds 
of elections redman said the us government is committed to 
the support and the consolidation of democratic government in el 
salvador no matter which party wins power through free and fair 
elections

president jose azcona hoyo said 
nicaraguan troops are retreating from honduran territory and the 
3200 us soldiers on an emergency mission in honduras probably 
wont be needed much longer 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
all or almost all the nicaraguan forces have returned to their 
homeland 
nicaragua which announced today it was suspending military 
operations against the usbacked contra rebels during ceasefire 
talks has denied sandinista forces entered honduras in pursuit of 
the contras 
defense minister gen humberto ortega leader of the nicaraguan 
delegation in the ceasefire talks also urged the contras to halt 
their military activities during the three days of discussions 
bosco matamoros spokesman for the contra delegation later 
announced a suspension of the contras offensive military 
operations in nicaragua as an expression of our good will 
redman told reporters in washington all or nearly all the 
nicaraguans had left honduras and there has been a substantial 
sandinista deployment on the nicaraguan side of the border 
i dont have any way to confirm that its a 100 per cent 
withdrawal but i think the evidence is that it has been a general 
withdrawal back across the river he said 
asked whether the american ground forces sent to honduras last 
week can be withdrawn redman said it was difficult to know what 
the sandinistas will do next 
one can hope that theyve learned a lesson this time he 
said 
on saturday honduras launched an air raid aimed at driving out 
about 600 sandinistas that officials said were leaving honduras too 
slowly the government said two usmade f5 fighter jets fired 
rockets at the sandinista troops 
honduras said the air raid was eight miles inside its borders 
but nicaragua said it was five miles within its territory 
nicaragua formally protested the air raid as an unwarranted act 
of aggression it said the honduran planes dropped bombs in the 
bocay area of nicaragua 170 miles northeast of managua 
things are getting back to normal azcona said sunday if 
there are no more incidents the american will leave he did not 
say when the us troops which began arriving thursday would 
depart nor did he further describe the sandinista withdrawal 
a highranking honduran military official said sunday that 
honduras planned to position troops all along the 500milelong 
border with nicaragua to guard against future incursions 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity would not say 
when the troops would be in place or if this would be a permanent 
operation 
president reagan ordered the us troops in after he and 
honduras said 2000 sandinistas had crossed the border 
rep gv montgomery dmiss a member of a congressional 
delegation that ended a factfinding mission to honduras on sunday 
said he expects the us military personnel to pull out in about a 
week 
i think itll all be over by then montgomery a member of 
the house armed services committee said at a news conference at 
palmerola headquarters for the american military operation in 
honduras 
the us national security adviser lt gen colin powell also 
said the fighting was essentially over appearing on abctvs 
this week with david brinkley powell said the troops will 
return to the united states soon 
peace talks between contra rebel leaders and officials of the 
sandinista government began today in the southern border post of 
sapoa nicaragua 90 miles south of managua near the costa rican 
border 
victor hugo tinoco deputy foreign minister in nicaragua said 
the talks will center on finding a way for the contras to lay down 
their arms the contras say the talks should include political 
issues 
the new 48 million proposal for us aid to the contras would 
include delivery of up to 25 million in previously authorized 
military assistance 
on sunday secretary of state george p shultz said in 
washington that the package should go forward although he said it 
was a little low on money 
but some in congress say the reagan administration if it 
chooses to back a new contra aid request must confront doubts 
about the seriousness of the border clash 
there is a very serious lack of full trust here said 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash 
foley said he hoped the latest round of fighting has not 
destroyed chances for progress in the nicaraguan peace talks

american soldiers engaged in military maneuvers sunday at a 
honduran airstrip just 20 miles from the nicaraguan border but 
us officials said the threat from sandinista troops had subsided 
and combat appeared unlikely 
president reagan sent 3200 us military personnel to

the supreme court agreed monday to decide 
whether abused children may sue public officials for failing to 
protect them from their parents 
the justices said they will hear an appeal on behalf of a 
wisconsin boy who suffered serious and permanent brain damage from 
beatings by his father social workers and officials are accused of 
gross negligence in ignoring evidence the boy was being brutally 
victimized 
the courts study of the case expected to yield a ruling 
sometime in 1989 comes amid growing concern nationwide over child 
abuse 
in other actions the court 
left intact a ruling that forces school officials in new mexico 
to defend themselves at trial against allegations they violated a 
young girls constitutional rights by paddling her 
left intact a federal law requiring broadcasters to give equal 
time to opposing candidates for public office 
agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law designed to 
promote competitive bidding on government contracts at issue is 
the proper boundary between presidential and congressional power 
agreed to decide in a case from texas whether states may impose 
sales taxes on most books newspapers and magazines while exempting 
religious publications 
refused to let states and local governments regulate the prices 
most of the nations cable television operators charge for basic 
service 
in the childabuse case the court will consider reinstating a 
suit against the winnebago county wis department of social 
services and two of its employees 
the agency was accused of violating the rights of joshua 
deshaney because it failed to rescue him from his fathers 
beatings the department was charged with knowing about the 
beatings since 1983 when joshua was four 
he has been institutionalized since 1984 suffering from 
injuries that destroyed half his brain and left him profoundly 
retarded 
the boys father randy deshaney since has been convicted of 
child abuse and sentenced to two years to four years in prison 
a social worker ann kemmeter was assigned to the deshaney case 
in 1983 after joshua was brought to a hospital with various cuts 
and bruises 
ms kemmeter visited the deshaney home several times but 
allegedly failed to take any steps to remove him from the home or 
protect him 
deshaneys exwife melody sued the social services officials 
on grounds they violated the childs constitutional right not to be 
deprived of liberty without due process 
mrs deshaney was divorced from her husband and living in 
cheyenne wyo when she was informed her son had suffered serious 
brain damage deshaney had custody of his son 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals threw out mrs deshaneys 
suit the appeals court said the social welfare agency and its 
employees though blameworthy did not cause joshuas injuries 
the appeals court said ms kemmeter merely failed to protect him 
from his bestial father 
the appeals court also said welfare agencies should not be 
placed in the predicament of removing a child from home and facing 
suit by the parent or leaving the child there and risk being sued 
by the child 
putting officials in that position is unlikely to improve the 
welfare of american families and is not grounded in constitutional 
text or principle the appeals court said 
in other developments the court 
agreed in a case from pennsylvania to consider shielding states 
from having to help pay for cleaning up hazardous waste sites when 
the federal government sues businesses under the superfund law

hundreds of thousands of 
blacks on monday defied emergency regulations and joined a national 
protest strike commemorating the 28th anniversary of the 
sharpeville massacre 
the strike occurred despite a ban on major opposition groups 
that usually coordinate such action 
the demonstration was widespread in the johannesburgpretoria 
area in durban and around the eastern cape province city of port 
elizabeth but there was no specific call for a strike in the cape 
town area and major mining companies reported little or no 
disruption of their operations 
police estimated 40 percent of the black work force around 
johannesburg stayed away from their jobs labor experts say there 
are about 800000 fulltime black workers in the area 
a south african court meanwhile denied an appeal by one of the 
countrys most outspoken antiapartheid newspapers clearing the 
way for the government to shut it down 
home affairs minister stoffel botha had intended to close the 
new nation in january but delayed the move while the newspaper 
sought temporary protection from government action 
after the court denied such protection monday bothas office 
declined to reveal when it would shut the periodical 
after the court decision monday the new nations acting editor 
gabu tugwana said we are pretending we dont face any 
suspension if the deadline for the thursday edition comes and we 
are printed good luck to us 
mondays protest commemorated the death of 69 black people 
killed in 1960 when police fired on thousands of demonstrators 
protesting south africas pass laws 
the laws restricting blacks freedom of movement were repealed 
in 1986 
in sharpeville the scene of the massacre residents placed 
flowers on the victims graves 
winnie mandela wife of jailed african national congress leader 
nelson mandela attended one of the services in the township south 
of johannesburg 
several hundred black youths jogged alongside mrs mandelas 
van chanting freedom songs 
in durban police in a helicopter fired tear gas to disperse 
boycotting students who rampaged through the campus at the 
predominantlyindian university of durbanwestville the boycotters 
chased students out of classes then assaulted them when they 
sought refuge in the library 
police reported two unrestrelated killings of blacks overnight 
one near durban and one in soweto but gave no indication whether 
they were linked to the protest 
four buses were firebombed in durban on monday and service to 
black townships was cancelled when drivers refused to work 
the united democratic front the countrys largest 
antiapartheid coalition had coordinated previous nationwide 
protests during the 21monthold state of emergency 
but last month it was banned along with 16 other 
organizations from participating in any activity not approved by 
the government 
several affiliates of the front took out newspaper 
advertisements announcing mondays national day of protest and 
anonymous pamphlets calling for school and work boycotts appeared 
on doorsteps in the black townships 
it is illegal under emergency regulations to call for boycotts 
of anykind 
police had said they would ensure the safety of blacks who 
wanted to go to work but they reported no intimidation in soweto 
the township of 25 million blacks outside johannesburg 
schools and shops were closed and there were virtually no 
passengers in commuter buses or taxivans 
one of the largest stayaways more than 90 percent of black 
workers occurred near the eastern cape city of uitenhage where 
police shot dead 21 blacks during a funeral procession on 
sharpeville day in 1985 
the port elizabeth evening post after carrying reports of the 
strike in its early editions received a telephone call from a 
police officer who noted that emergency regulations prohibit news 
reports about the impact of illegal strikes 
the newspaper dropped the strike stories from its late edition 
but there were no reports of similar warnings being issued to other 
media

a leukemia patient learned monday his bone 
marrow does not match that of his brother a homeless florida man 
who had refused to undergo testing until an anonymous donor offered 
him 1000 
stephen l chapman 38 said that although he was disappointed 
the marrow was not suitable for transplant he had tried not to get 
his hopes too high 
you kind of start counting on things and then you have a big 
letdown said chapman ive just made up my mind not to count 
on anything 
his doctors said they were presenting other treatment options to 
chapman whose leukemia is in remission 
the next best step is unknown but there are choices said 
dr richard s fayssoux the hematology and oncology specialist 
treating chapman 
the chances for him to live longer would have been better 
with the transplant but its not like hes guaranteed a 50year 
life with the transplant fayssoux said 
the patients brother randy chapman 32 was located last month 
on the streets of miami he earns his living as a test subject for 
medical experiments and initially refused to submit to tests to 
determine whether his marrow matched that of his ill brother 
he eventually accepted an indiana philanthropists offer of 
1000 to take the tests the brother who left home 14 years ago 
would have received an additional 2000 had there been a match and 
subsequent transplant 
chapman the father of two children continues to undergo 
chemotherapy treatments doctors have told him that forms of 
treatment other than the bone marrow transplant might be less risky 
and painful but also potentially less effective 
he wouldnt have the immediate risk but he also wouldnt have 
the longterm possibilities said fayssoux 
chapman said doctors were checking into a partial bone marrow 
match located through the national marrow registry 
well come up with something else chapman said its 
pretty difficult but i wasnt counting on it either way

letting a trucks diesel engine run at idle 
causes twice as much damage as driving and truckers who let their 
rigs idle during rest stops are wasting money and diesel fuel a 
researcher said monday 
some truckers have a misconception that idling is good for their 
rigs but researchers at argonne national laboratory found that 
excess idling can shorten the life of a diesel truck engine by six 
months to a year 
theres a lot of misinformation out there among truckers 
said larry r johnson director of argonnes center for 
transportation research they realize its using fuel but some 
of them perceive that its good for the engine to keep it running 
in one of a series of studies for the us department of energy 
aimed at improving fuel efficiency in the trucking industry 
johnson said argonne researchers found that one hour of idling 
causes as much engine wear as two hours of driving 
based on interviews with trucking company officials and drivers 
they calculated that a typical 18wheeler idles about 800 hours a 
year the equivalent of 64000 miles of driving johnson said 
monday in a telephone interview 
he said that much idling would make the engine need an overhaul 
up to a year sooner than under normal driving conditions 
it wears out an engine twice as fast as being under load 
johnson said 
diesel engines usually require an overhaul every five years or 
500000 miles he said 
many truckers leave their rigs running when they stop to rest as 
a way of keeping the engine and diesel fuel warm in the winter and 
keeping the cab heated or cooled in summer he said 
but the argonne researchers found that idling in the winter 
cools the engine faster than if it were shut off because fans blow 
cold air over the engine block and fuel lines johnson said 
the lower idling temperature damages the engine by causing water 
vapor to condense in the crankcase said raj sekar a mechanical 
engineer at the argonne transportation center 
the water mixes with unburned sulfur oxides from diesel fuel 
combustion and produces sulfuric acid which corrodes the piston 
rings and cylinder liners he said 
the argonne researchers also calculated that the typical trucker 
idles his engine at least three hours each workday wasting an 
estimated 800 gallons of fuel a year johnson said 
as an alternative to idling johnson said the argonne study 
recommended that truckers or trucking companies buy heaters for the 
fuel system engine block cab and sleeping compartment he said 
the cost of buying each heater would pay for itself in one year 
through fuel savings alone 
argonne located 25 miles west of chicago is operated by the 
university of chicago for the department of energy

president reagans spokesman monday predicted 
quick action in congress to renew us aid to nicaraguas contra 
rebels but there was little movement on capitol hill toward any 
new aid package 
we anticipate signing on to a bill in the sense that we want 
a contra aid package and we are working to get the best one that 
we can get white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters i think something will be very forthcoming very soon 
but house speaker jim wright dtexas the administrations 
chief opponent on the issue seemed disinclined to move ahead 
before seeing the outcome of a new round of ceasefire talks 
between the rebels and nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
what we need to watch very carefully is the peace talks 
wright told reporters i hope both sides will be very 
forthcoming 
asked about prospects for a 48 million contra aid proposal 
being drawn up by senate backers of the rebels wright objected to 
provisions that allow the cia to continue delivering previously 
stockpiled weapons and that would give reagan a guaranteed future 
vote in congress on new military aid 
if they would agree to humanitarian aid without military aid 
that could be done very swiftly wright said we would be ready 
to meet with republicans at any time 
the continued standoff on the aid issue seemed to be an 
indication that last weeks developments in the region had little 
clear impact on congressional opinion sandinista troops allegedly 
crossed the honduran border to attack rebel camps and the united 
states responded by sending nearly 3200 troops into honduras in a 
symbolic show of force 
the last us aid to the rebels ended feb 29 and the issue has 
been stalled since the house voted narrowly on march 3 to defeat a 
30 million package of strictly humanitarian help food 
clothing and the like for the rebels 
the senate aid package assembled by sens nancy kassebaum 
rkan david boren dokla and others would offer a oneyear 
48 million infusion of humanitarian aid as well as continued 
authority for the cia to deliver weapons remaining in rebel 
inventories estimated at as much as 25 million 
in addition it would give the administration the right to a 
guaranteed expedited vote on a future request for new weapons aid 
to the contras 
fitzwater said the administration was encouraged by the package 
but he stopped short of fully endorsing it saying other 
suggestions also were welcome 
he said the administration would hold talks with wright when 
the time is right discussions with other lawmakers would 
continue he said but he refused to name the individuals 
president reagan was scheduled to go to capitol hill on tuesday 
for a meeting with republican house members and aid to the rebels 
was expected to be high on the list of items for discussion 
fitzwater said last weeks sandinista incursion had improved 
chances for passage of a contra aid bill in congress he said the 
incident had left little to the imagination in terms of what 
president daniel ortega and the sandinistas are really up to 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash said it was not 
clear that the incident had changed congressional minds 
foley said he believed administration intelligence reports of a 
wellplanned sandinista incursion involving at least 1500 troops 
but he said it appeared casualties were low and that the contras 
were not seriously disrupted as a force in the field it has not 
been established that there is any need for an immediate military 
resupply he said

sandinista government and contra rebel 
leaders today announced a suspension of military operations during 
the first ceasefire talks ever held inside the country 
gen humberto ortega the nations defense minister and brother 
of president daniel ortega made the announcement that government 
troops were halting military operations and urged the contras to 
act in kind 
he called the three days of peace talks that began today in this 
small town on the border with costa rica an historic encounter 
bosco matamoros spokesman for the contra delegation later 
announced a suspension of offensive military operations in 
nicaragua as an expression of our good will he also said the 
conversations were frank and of mutual respect 
the talks began at 1110 am 1210 pm est more than an 
hour late both delegations started meeting behind closed doors in 
the custom house on the border just outside sapoa the only 
building large enough here for the event 
humberto ortega is heading the nicaraguan delegation to the 
peace talks alfredo cesar is the leader of the contra delegation 
the sandinista delegation includes brian wilson an american 
pacifist whose legs were severed when he was hit by a train during 
a protest last year and singer kris kristofferson wilson and 
kristofferson are longtime sandinista supporters 
cheering sandinista supporters lined both sides of the 
90milelong road from managua to sapoa as ortega drove by many 
carried redandblack sandinista flags and school children waved 
nicaraguan blueandwhite paper banners 
mariachi bands played music along the route the crowds shouted 
we insist on the surrender of the mercenaries as the contras 
are called by the sandinistas 
the contra delegation arrived a few minutes after the 
sandinistas in a bus escorted by a group of cars and jeeps the 
entire town was closely guarded by sandinista troops and security 
agents in plainclothes 
adolfo calero another contra leader said the contras came 
here with an open agenda and that it includes democratization 
includes amnesty we insisted on speaking about all the problems 
facing nicaragua 
the peace talks were held despite an earlier sandinista 
offensive along the honduran border 
in a break with the past both sides agreed that the talks would 
have an open agenda 
but on sunday deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco 
reiterated a previous sandinista position that the negotiations 
strictly deal with the mechanics of a ceasefire 
and the contras indicated that they wanted to talk about other 
matters such as democratization and free elections 
the contras replaced calero the topranking leader of the 
nicaraguan resistance with cesar as head of their delegation in 
the hope that his familiarity with the sandinistas might pressure 
the nicaraguan government into serious negotiations 
cesar was a former highranking sandinista official before he 
broke with the sandinistas in 1982 
also scheduled to attend was aristides sanchez a third member 
of the directorate of the resistance the contra umbrella 
organization 
entering todays sessions contra leaders indicated they were 
not optimistic 
the sandinistas dont object to making tactical concessions 
but they will never enact reforms that risk their grip on power in 
nicaragua said contra adviser gonzalo facio 
cesar asserted the contras had recently suffered military 
setbacks but that the sandinista offensive had helped their cause 
politically 
rebel fighters are going to be militarily weakened by the 
suspension of united states aid and the growth in soviet aid to the 
sandinistas cesar said 
but he added that politically we are going to be stronger and 
the sandinistas weaker because the international community 
condemned them for their bombardments last week of our positions 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo the mediator in previous talks 
and an observer to todays discussions also seemed pessimistic 
about their outcome 
i see the situation as quite complicated he said during his 
sunday homily in managua it is very difficult to reconcile two 
things that are completely opposite 
the ceasefire talks are called for under a central american 
peace plan signed by the regions five presidents last aug 7 
the sandinistas have already complied with some stipulations in 
the peace accord by lifting a nearly 6yearold state of emergency 
and allowing more press freedom 
the rebels have been fighting the government since 1981 in a 
conflict that has killed more than 40000 people

a us army transport helicopter participating 
in a military exercise in honduras crashed on monday and a number 
of soldiers were reported injured pentagon officials said 
the officials who requested anonymity said the accident 
occurred monday afternoon near the honduran town of juticalpa and 
involved an american uh1 huey transport copter 
while the initial reports were fragmentary it appeared that the 
copter was carrying nine soldiers and that all of them survived 
the sources said 
we have no reports of any fatalities said one official 
but we do have reports of some injuries and medical evacuations 
under way 
the sources said the accident did not occur in or near a combat 
zone and did not involve hostile fire 
it looks like it was mechanical said one official 
the accident scene was said to be located about six miles south 
of juticalpa that would place it 35 miles north of the 
hondurasnicaragua border and about 60 miles west of the border 
region where nicaraguan troops were fighting contra guerrillas last 
week 
the pentagon sources who stressed they were awaiting more 
information from us authorities in honduras said it was unclear 
whether the nine aboard the huey were all american or whether some 
of the passengers might have included honduran troops 
the united states airlifted more than 3100 army troops to 
honduras last week in a warning to the leftist sandinista 
government after nicaraguan troops moved into honduras to attack 
base camps of the usbacked contra guerrillas 
after arriving in honduras the american soldiers dispersed 
around the country for joint exercises with honduran forces one of 
those exercise areas is near juticalpa and a battalion from the 
82nd airborne division was sent to that site 
the reagan administration has made it clear it does not intend 
to send the us troops into combat with the sandinistas 
administration sources said monday it appeared the fighting was 
ending in any event and that nicaragua was withdrawing its troops 
from honduran soil 
according to the pentagon sources the uh1 that crashed monday 
was apparently assigned to us forces in panama and was not 
airlifted to the country by the 82nd airborne 
the pentagon maintains a force of about 1100 military personnel 
in honduras as part of what is known as joint task force bravo to 
oversee training exercises in the central american country

48story towers topped by vshaped structures one holding a 
restaurant and one a museum 
another designed by an international consortium that includes 
the architect im pei feature a roadway held by two metal 
wishbones slightly twisted like a ribbon pulled taut and given a 
half turn 
but the designs may never span anything but the imagination 
since announcing the competition for a new bridge last year 
local officials have discovered that the bridge may not be as close 
to collapse as was feared although a 1985 study showed that the 
bridge would have to be replaced by 1995 later inspections have 
indicated that it might last longer 
preliminary estimates indicate that the bridge could be 
renovated for about 250 million estimates for a new bridge range 
from 200 million to 600 million 
still bridge engineers attending mondays unveiling said they 
could not resist the opportunity to design a major new bridge for 
one of the worlds largest cities 
such a location youll never find again said swiss engineer 
bruno thurlimann of zurich who collaborated on a swissamerican 
proposal with im pei amp partners and three other companies its 
a onceinalifetime chance 
asking why an engineer submitted a design is like asking sir 
edmund hillary why did you climb mount everest said nils d 
olsson of drc consultants inc 
structural engineers are always looking for fresh challenges 
and this is one of the most important projects since the 
verrazano he said 
olsson whose new york firm proposed the restauranttopped 
bridge was referring to the verrazanonarrows bridge a link 
completed in 1964 between brooklyn and staten island with 4260 
feet between supports it is one of the worlds longest suspension 
bridge 
most of the designs for the williamsburg call for a 1600foot 
cablestayed bridge that would be the longest of its type in the 
world 
a cablestayed bridge has cables stretching from its towers to 
the roadway while a suspension bridge has a roadway hung from 
cables stretching from one side to the other

the united states has sold mexico 30000 
metric tons of surplus nonfat dry milk for 1260 per ton about a 
third less than it cost american taxpayers the agriculture 
department said monday 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg said the surplus 
powdered milk was sold by the departments commodity credit corp 
to conasupo the mexican governments food purchasing authority 
goldberg said the sale reflects the world market price for 
nonfat dry milk at the time the sale was negotiated with mexico 
deliveries are scheduled through march 1989 in addition the ccc 
provided mexico with a threeyear credit arrangement at commercial 
rates of interest he said 
according to a recent ccc report about 454 million pounds of 
nonfat dry milk were held in storage with a value of more than 
385 million or about 85 cents per pound 
there are approximately 2205 pounds in a metric ton which 
translates to a us value of 1874 per ton 
the surplus was acquired by ccc through purchases of cheese 
butter and nonfat dry milk to support the price of milk paid to 
dairy farmers 
congress in 1985 farm law mandated the export sale of 150000 
tons of dairy products annually for the three fiscal years ending 
sept 30 1988 the latest deal with mexico boosted sales this year 
to 77520 tons goldberg said

the latest squabble between prosecutors and 
defense attornyes isnt about cases tactics or money its about 
being able to bypass new security procedures at the dirksen federal 
building and its headed for where else the bench 
complaints from the public have been few but the security 
system brought the entire us district court system here to a 
screeching halt one afternoon and prompted 39 attorneys including 
several of chicagos bestknown defenders to petition the 
districts 21 judges for the same exemptions granted to prosecutors 
and building employees a decision is expected thursday 
things are bad enough when the lines stretch all the way 
around the elevator bank attorney judith halprin who is 
spearheading the defenders effort said monday 
but when they decided to give exemptions to prosecutors she 
added that was the last straw 
replied us attorney anton valukas were being given 
exemptions because were employees of the building no more no 
less this seems to be a means by which certain people can keep 
their names in the paper 
the us marshals office said the procedures were in response 
to a growing number of threats against the federal judiciary 
nationwide and an increase in terrorism trials they follow recent 
trials of members of the el rukn street gang and the puerto rican 
independence group faln on terrorismrelated charges 
ms halprins first act of defiance came march 8 the day the 
airporttype screening began with federal marshals using metal 
detectors for all people heading to courtroom floors and xray 
machines for briefcases 
ms halprin invoking her constitutional rights against 
unreasonable search and seizure refused to step through the metal 
detector on her way to us district judge brian duffs courtroom 
that was 10 am ms halprin waited in the lobby for more than 
two hours while her client charged with selling phony immigration 
papers to an undercover agent stood before duff 
the judge issued an order exempting ms halprin but she 
remained there for another two hours because a marshal refused to 
disobey chief us district judge john gradys original directive 
duff responded by ordering chief us marshal john adams to 
appear before him and explain why he should not be held in contempt 
of court 
duff himself was then called to an emergency meeting of the 
districts judges and a new order resulted attorneys working 
trials that began prior to march 8 could be exempted for the 
duration of that trial 
but that hasnt satisfied ms halprin and her colleagues 
theyre exempting whole classes of people chicago policemen 
for example she said well one of us was representing a cop 
subpoenaed by a grand jury 
so the target of the investigation gets to go through 
untouched she added and the lawyer is the one subjected to a 
search of his person and papers 
now is that silly or not

efforts to place deaf students in regular 
public schools have backfired leaving many deaf students with an 
inadequate education a government commission told a senate panel 
monday 
the state of the art in deafness education today at all levels 
is unsatisfactory frank r bowe who chaired the commission on 
education of the deaf told the senate labor and human resources 
subcommittee on the handicapped we still have high school 
graduates reading below a thirdgrade level 
the 13member commission established by congress in 1986 
concluded that the education department should consider placing 
deaf students in special schools or centers for the deaf instead 
of forcing them to compete with their hearing counterparts 
those of us who are deaf have had access to some form of 
education but its not been a good one and its not getting 
better said bowe a regional commissioner of the rehabilitation 
services administration who also is deaf 
twothirds of the panel themselves are deaf the commission 
made up of government officials and educators of the deaf also 
included actress nanette fabray macdougall 
the report also recommended that a majority of the board of 
trustees of gallaudet university be hearing impaired which was a 
demand made by students at the school for the deaf during protests 
earlier this month 
the commission concluded that significant improvements have been 
made in techniques for educating the deaf since 1965 when a 
federal panel last suggested changes 
the report also determined however that the actual 
implementation of these changes has been inadequate and sometimes 
misguided and that progress has been at best spotty and sporadic 
the commission found that 95 percent of americas deaf students 
are prelingually deaf left without hearing at birth or 
deprived of it in infancy and recommended improvements in 
identifying these children and teaching them english 
early intervention programs are very important said 
gertrude galloway a commission member right now many children 
come to school at 4 or 5 with no language 
the commission also called for expansion of postsecondary 
education programs including vocational and technical training 
junior college and college programs currently there are two 
colleges in the nation for deaf students and four regional 
postsecondary programs housed at hearing colleges 
the commission also recommended that the department of education 
include american sign language the native language to most of 
those born deaf under the bilingual education act which would 
treat asl like any other foreign language this would give deaf 
students access to special training programs other foreignlanguage 
students now receive 
establishment of a national institute on deafness as part of the 
federal national insititutes of health is another priority of the 
commission along with the creation of a national technical 
insititute for the deaf at gallaudet 
the commission also instructed congress to pass legislation 
requiring the federal communications commission to issue rules 
making new televisions capable of decoding closedcaption 
broadcasts until those sets are common decoders should be 
distributed free the commission said 
the commission took 20 months to interview deaf education 
specialists students and school administrators before coming up 
with the 52 recommendations included in the 144page report 
a house panel will hold hearings on the commissions study next 
week and senate and house committees then will work with the 
department of education to establish some of the proposed changes 
members of the deaf community lauded the report 
the commission is on target said philip bravin an ibm 
executive named last week to chair gallaudets board of trustees 
the education of the deaf in america needs to be improved im 
doing ok but many of my friends and peers arent

a bottle containing a note from a high 
school class probably languished for two years in the gulf stream 
before a hurricane swept it to the coast of france a marine 
biology teacher said 
the bottle was found by pierre maupin the day after the storm 
hit the brittany village of carnac in northwest france last 
october said john gregory a teacher at john i leonard high 
school 
it was ironic the guy who found it didnt show excitement 
gregory said friday he just filled out the information sheet 
sent it back and that was it 
but students at the school who received maupins reply in late 
december are enthusiastic about the bottlereleasing project 
which is aimed at helping them learn more about ocean currents 
when he told us what we would be doing at first it didnt 
seem as exciting but when we started getting the letters back it 
seemed interesting said 16yearold anthony izzarone 
since 1976 gregorys classes have released about 900 
siliconesealed bottles 30 miles off floridas gold coast into the 
gulf stream so far 104 bottles have been found in locations 
ranging from cape canaveral and melbourne just up the florida 
coast to the azores islands in the midatlantic 
the high schools experiments have a return rate of 11 percent 
thats much better than the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration which gets back only about 2 percent of the bottles 
it puts in the ocean to test currents gregory said

environmentalists still nagged by the 
demise of the last known dusky seaside sparrow plan a final search 
of the birds onetime habitat before writing an epitaph 
a search of the area near kennedy space center had been planned 
for this spring even though regional officials of the us fish 
and wildlife service are convinced there are no more duskies 
a final search will be conducted in about a year before the 
dusky is declared extinct said john christian deputy assistant 
regional director of the wildlife service in atlanta 
state and federal officials sponsor the birdwatching expedition 
in which volunteers will go through area with binoculars if no 
duskies are spotted the species will be considered extinct 
the last tiny dusky died of old age in june in a specially 
designed environment on discovery island a walt disney world 
zoological park primarily for birds the last five survivors all 
males were taken there from their only known wildlife habitat on 
cape canaveral several years ago 
they were bred with close cousins seeking to preserve their 
genes but they died one by one 
the birds decline began in the 1940s when mosquito fighters 
began spraying ddt over the st johns river refuge marshlands 
ruining the duskies eggs and insect food supply 
although they were protected by law conservationists say the 
birds did not have much chance against diking drainage 
landclearing highway construction housing developments 
mosquitocontrol projects and fires 
we have laws protecting the species but not the habitat 
said john wood a federal official you can protect the species 
all you want but if you dont have the habitat they have no place 
to go and wont make it 
but christian pointed out that the 5000acre st johns refuge 
was purchased for 3 million to protect the dusky 
we thought we had enough habitat to sustain them and then the 
population just crashed christian said we will never know 
what biological mechanism was responsible nobody really knows 
charles cook curator of discovery island and a leader in the 
fight to preserve the dusky genes said he hoped that someday some 
of the partduskies will be released on an experimental basis in 
the protected area 
cook believes there is a chance one or more of the birds may 
exist in a remote section of the refuge 
scientists always keep the option open he said i 
definitely feel it is worth looking into particularly in a 
peripheral habitat not frequently visited by people

the political damage ohio and other 
urban states may be doing to themselves by holding lateseason 
presidential primaries could go beyond having fewer candidate 
choices an elections researcher says 
linda lm bennett a political science professor at wittenberg 
university says the problems of ohios cities and others in the 
northeast and midwest may be ignored as candidates look past ohios 
may 3 primary and toward the clincher california which holds its 
primary june 7 
the problem begins with the emphasis placed on the february iowa 
caucuses ms bennett says 
it emphasizes all the old classic themes of american 
politics such as the romanticized notion of farming she said 
but urban problems are getting lost in the shuffle 
it would be nice if they addressed the issues of the 90 
percent of us who live in urban areas ms bennett said

here are some of the recommendations made 
monday by the commission on education of the deaf in a 
congressionally ordered report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the us department of education should put less emphasis on 
placing deaf students in the least restrictive environment and 
more on providing an appropriate education for many that means 
special schools and centers for the deaf 
the department should specify that removing a deaf child from a 
regular classroom does not require compelling evidence 
congress should grant full recognition to american sign 
language as a native language just like spanish under the 
bilingual education act and programs 
more help and services for lowachieving deaf students not 
just the college bound 
congress should require the federal communications commission 
to force broadcasters to caption their programming and consider 
the same requirement for film producers 
congress should caption its own televised proceedings 
congress should require the fcc to issue rules making new tv 
sets capable of decoding closed captions until such sets become 
widely available decoders should be distributed free to the deaf 
earlier identification of deaf infants it isnt necessary to 
test the hearing of every newborn just those at high risk of 
hearing impairments 
the us department of health and human services should issue 
guidelines to help states improve screening procedures 
parents should have the option to choose what type of school 
their child attends and must believe in whichever communication 
method is chosen for their childs educational program 
congress should pass a quality in deaf education bill 
changes should be made in the management of gallaudet 
university including appointment of a majority of deaf people to 
its board of trustees 
congress should bar hearing undergraduates from gallaudet 
which in 1985 began to admit a handful interested in careers in 
education of the deaf 
the model secondary school for the deaf at gallaudet should 
admit more lowachieving deaf students so that it more closely 
mirrors the national demographics of secondary schoolage deaf 
children 
the government should expand its regional postsecondary 
education program to the southwest it now has programs in other 
regions 
congress should establish a national center on deafness 
research at gallaudet 
congress should create a national institute on deafness and 
other communication disorders at the national institutes of health 
gallaudet and the national technical institute for the deaf in 
rochester ny should limit enrollment of foreign students to 10 
percent and charge them 75 percent of the actual costs or about 
18250 a year 
both gallaudet and ntid should do a better job of hiring the 
deaf only 12 percent of the staff at ntid and 25 percent at 
gallaudet are deaf

state attorney general robert abrams said 
monday he will prevent representatives of tawana brawley from 
disrupting the grand jury hearing evidence into the black 
teenagers allegations that she was sexually attacked by six white 
men 
the rev al sharpton a new york city minister advising the 
16yearold girl has threatened to stop anyone from testifying 
tuesday at the grand jury hearing sharpton said hed risk arrest 
to stop the proceedings 
i dont think there is a need or necessity to move the grand 
jury but we would take any and all steps that are necessary to 
protect the integrity of the grand jury process abrams said at a 
news conference 
representatives of miss brawley have refused to cooperate with 
state prosecutors investigating the alleged racial and sexual 
attack they have criticized suggestions that witnesses might be 
granted immunity in exchange for their testimony 
the teenagers lawyers want a special prosecutor named to 
investigate racerelated crimes for abrams to be removed from the 
case and for a new grand jury to be convened outside of dutchess 
county 
abrams also said he was appalled at the telecast of photos of 
miss brawley shortly after her alleged november attack by a group 
of white men and is investigating how a television station got the 
pictures 
he said no one in his office authorized the release of the 
photos which were shown thursday night on wnbc in new york city 
and nationally on the nbcs network news 
i was indeed quite upset abrams said adding its a 
serious invasion of the privacy of the victim 
one of the photos shows the word nigger scrawled on miss 
brawleys stomach and another shows her lying in her hospital bed 
with monitoring devices attached to her upper torso 
mary lou ocallaghan director of news information for nbc said 
the network would not reveal the source of the photos we covered 
what has become a significant news story she said in defense of 
the telecast 
abrams said he was confident that no one in the attorney 
generals task force released the photos other law enforcement 
agencies that investigated the case might have given the photos

the pentagon has quietly increased the number 
of security personnel in panama dispatching more than 300 soldiers 
to the strifetorn country in the past three days officials said 
monday 
twothirds of those dispatched during the latest troop movement 
were members of the 503rd military police battalion which is 
headquartered at fort bragg nc the pentagon said 
the remainder were dispatched from fort eustis va and fort 
hood texas 
capt nancy laluntas a pentagon spokeswoman said in response 
to a query that 212 members of the 503rd military police 
battalion have deployed to panama to augment us security forces 
in that country 
this deployment of military police is not in response to any 
incident but simply good planning in view of the current unrest in 
panama she continued 
the deployment began last friday and is a prudent measure 
consistent with the panama canal treaty to further safeguard the 
canal and us lives property and interests in the area she 
said 
in addition to the mps about 100 soldiers from forts eustis and 
hood were dispatched to assist in the movement of these 
additional security force personnel and to augment us southern 
command security forces she added 
those soldiers are army airfield movements control 
personnel the spokeswoman said 
the latest dispatch of troops comes less than a week after the 
pentagon ordered slightly more than 100 marine and air force 
security personnel to panama to bolster security around the panama 
canal and nearby military bases 
all told about 420 security personnel have now been sent to 
panama to join the roughly 600 servicemen who already were assigned 
to security duties with the us southern command which is 
headquartered there 
the southern command which oversees all us military 
operations in the region has about 10000 servicemen assigned to 
it 
the pentagons security concerns stem from the administrations 
efforts to unseat panamanian strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
although no moves have been reported against american servicemen 
or their dependents defense officials are said to be concerned 
that noriega might lash back at the united states by attacking or 
sabotaging facilities there

backers of a drive to oust mayor federico pena say 
they expect to collect 50000 signatures 10000 more than 
necessary to force a new election by the april 13 deadline 
i think were going to be in real good shape said marge 
doty whose metropolitan action committee is heading the recall 
effort she said the names would be counted wednesday 
just because marge says it doesnt mean its true said 
former denver election commissioner susan duncan leader of a group 
fighting the recall 
recall organizers must prove at least 39091 signatures are of 
registered voters in order to force a new election the ballot 
would include pena and all candidates who collected 300 valid 
nominating signatures 
the recall drive against pena now in his second term is rooted 
in the public works department where employees began gathering 
after last summers mayoral election to air their grievances 
by fall the workers who complained pena is a poor manager had 
hired doty retired director of admissions at denver general 
hospital 
basically were guiding ourselves by intuition doty said 
in an interview last week the political expertise is coming from 
the seat of my pants 
the petition drive was launched jan 15 amid criticism of penas 
snowremoval efforts after a christmas weekend snowstorm left 
unplowed impassable streets the effort was fueled by television 
reports last month that street crews who were followed and 
secretly filmed were loafing on duty 
but even if enough valid signatures are collected it could be 
months before an election is held 
after april 13 pena will have 10 days to challenge signatures 
and the election commission will have 50 days to conduct hearings 
on the mayors appeal 
if there are enough valid signatures the city council will have 
to schedule an election within 60 to 90 days 
pena would be reimbursed by the city for any legal challenge to 
the petitions if he won the recall election the state would 
reimburse him for campaign expenses

for a family of four two with aids and two exposed to the fatal 
disease said the father 
the parents who agreed to be interviewed by the tampa tribune 
if their identities were protected lost their jobs and were forced 
to seek government assistance their two cars were repossessed and 
furniture sold to pay debts and buy food said the couple who are 
in their 30s 
the woman said she confided in a friend at work who told the 
boss she and her husband who worked in the entertainment field 
were fired she said 
we were rejected by almost everyone we knew everyone we 
worked with he said 
the couple said they filed a discrimination complaint with the 
florida commission on human relations but dropped the case after an 
investigator told them that fighting their exemployer would expose 
the family to a traumatic public argument possibily involving 
their children 
the father said he was infected with the aids virus through a 
sexual encounter with another man years ago the tribune reported 
monday 
unknowingly carrying the virus he married in 1980 and two years 
later fathered a son he was healthy he said except for a nagging 
cough and a shortness of breath one doctor attributed to asthma 
then early last year while his wife was pregnant with their 
second child he learned he had acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome the newspaper reported 
worse he learned his 6yearold son has aids his wife is being 
treated for aidsrelated complex a lesssevere condition 
associated with the aids virus 
and their 7monthold son has tested positive for aids 
antibodies but doctors dont know if he will develop the disease 
a couple of months ago the father said i was ready to die 
but his outlook changed he said mainly because of an aids support 
group and the realization that his family needed him 
before you die of aids he said you have to live with 
it 
today the family primarily lives on social security disability 
payments medical costs average more than 1100 a month and they 
must pay 251 before medicaids catastrophic healthcare plan picks 
up the rest 
when you look at it from the financial point of view it looks 
pretty bleak he said so we dont look at it that way

with chrysler corp chief lee 
iacocca at his side democrat richard gephardt on monday defended 
his presidential campaigns 48000 kcar television 
advertisement saying critics are missing the point 
and he suggested that massachusetts gov michael dukakis might 
be easing his opposition to gephardts tough trade legislation 
you may be seeing a battlefield conversion by the end of 
the week he may be supporting the gephardt amendment the 
missouri congressman said of his democratic presidential rival 
gephardt said dukakis told michigan democrats over the weekend 
that he supported trade legislation by sen donald w riegle jr of 
michigan which gephardt said was the senate counterpart to his 
own bill 
however there are differences between the proposals offered by 
the two lawmakers gephardts amendment targets excess and 
unwarranted trade surpluses for elimination without specifically 
going after trade barriers riegles proposal a compromise with 
critics of the gephardt amendment directs the us trade 
representative to secure the removal of unfair trade barriers 
gephardt said he must win michigans caucuses saturday to keep 
his campaign alive he spent the day campaigning across the state 
speaking to law students at the university of michigan in ann 
arbor visiting a steel mill in trenton and meeting with iacocca in 
highland park 
he brushed aside suggestions that his kcar advertisement 
inaccurately claimed that the 10000 chrysler car would cost 
48000 in south korea asked if the figure was correct iacocca 
said gephardt has the point correct whatever the details 
close to it maybe its only 3540000 but dont lose sight 
of it its still a big difference between 7000 here for a 
comparable car iacocca told reporters outside the chrysler corp 
headquarters near detroit 
the detroit free press reported monday that a kcar would cost 
about 33000 in korea but that none is sold there and gephardt in 
an interview with the detroit news admitted that many of those 
taxes are levied in korea on domestic consumption 
gephardt said the ad was designed to educate voters to the 
problems created by foreign barriers to american products 
the hyundai ad is simply to get them to see what we face he 
said 
im told the ad is imperfect because they have enough taxes in 
south korea so that a south korean has to pay 29000 for 
hyundai gephardt told 400 law students in ann arbor they 
dont want their people to buy cars thats an export platform 
we cant have those 
later on the campaign bus gephardt said the debate misses the 
point i really dont think it is south koreans interest to get 
into this is it 38000 or 48000 
at the chrysler corp headquarters gephardt met privately with 
iacocca at a outdoor news conference both men said they talked 
about trade and not about an endorsement 
dicks a good friend of mine and he knows what hes talking 
about on trade iacocca said 
gephardt praised the corporate chief for his help on trade 
policy 
he was one who stood up for the gephardt trade amendment on 
the floor and said it would improve our trade policy gephardt 
said 
gephardt said there was no delay in getting his trade amendment 
through a congressional conference committee 
this week were going to send the offer back to the senate 
they sent up their bill were going to send them our bill i 
want to get the trade bill done and when its done its going to 
be a tough new trade policy along the lines of the gephardt 
amendment he said 
every other democratic candidate has been critical of the 
gephardt trade amendment gov dukakis has said it is dead 
gephardt said he agrees i guess with the wall street journal 
editorial page foreign business interests and the reagan 
administration who all want to see the gephardt amendment dead 
the gephardt amendment is alive and well and were going to pass 
it 
in the speech at the law school where he was graduated 
gephardt discarded a prepared text in which he admitted his 
campaign is reeling 
yes weve had some setbacks but the view from the canvas is 
quite an education and what ive learned is that defeat is not 
being knocked down defeat is not getting back up he said in 
his prepared text theres no quit in me and theres not quit in 
you 
earlier in highland park gephardt said im going to do well 
in michigan the people in michigan are interested in someone who 
is really going to stand up on the trade issue they know im that 
candidate obviously i need a good result here

rightists stunned the ruling 
christian democrats on monday with a landslide victory in 
legislative and municipal elections weakening president jose 
napoleon duarte in his last year in office 
voters ignored a leftist guerrilla call to boycott the elections 
and threats of violence and turned out in great numbers sunday to 
elect legislators and municipal officials from 262 towns and cities 
nationwide 
mario samayoa president of the central elections council said 
more than 50 percent of the votes cast went to the republican 
nationalist alliance known as arena 
the rout included the election of arena candidate armando 
calderon sol a 39yearold lawyer as mayor of san salvador in a 
race against alejandro duarte son of duarte 
the defeat in the capital home to 15 million of the countrys 
5 million people was especially bitter because the christian 
democrats had held the post since 1964 
final results of the nationwide races were not expected before 
tuesday night 
the guerrillas rejected the elections as illegitimate 
contending they could not be free and fair in wartime 
samayoa said monday that more than 70 percent of the 16 million 
registered voters cast ballots 
we knew they the guerrillas would not be able to daunt the 
people to intimidate them he said 
samayoas announcement of a majority for arena meant the triumph 
was even greater than the rightists had originally predicted 
increasing their membership in 60seat national assembly from 13 to 
at least 30 
such a tally would guarantee arena control of the legislature 
because two small rightist parties supportive of arena are assured 
of at least one seat apiece 
local media projections gave arena between 33 and 35 seats the 
christian democrats entered the race with 33 seats 
the upset by arena drastically altered prospects for duarte one 
of the staunchest us allies in central america in his final year 
as president it raised big questions about el salvador will 
proceed in its fight against an 8yearold guerrilla insurgency and 
how it will deal with staggering problems of underdevelopment 
aggravated by the conflict 
arena formed in 1981 is fiercely nationalistic its founder 
retired army maj roberto daubuisson has blasted the united 
states and is considered the boss of early 1980s deathsquads 
former us ambassador to el salvador robert white once 
described daubuisson who retained his legislative seat in 
sundays vote as a pathological killer 
daubuisson has rejected such charges as well as the term 
death squads he says citizens were obliged to defend 
themselves against leftist terrorists 
the partys president alfredo cristiani a coffeegrower and 
businessman who was educated at georgetown university has been 
trying to project an image of moderation for the past two years 
cristiani also retained his seat in the legislature 
el salvador needs support and would probably be in difficult 
problems if the us would not provide support he told the 
associated press in an interview sunday 
washington sent el salvador almost 600 million in military and 
economic aid last year tops in the western hemisphere 
in washington the state department hailed el salvadors 
national elections and called them a strong victory for the 
democratic process 
sen richard lugar an indiana repblican who led an observer 
team named by president reagan called the election honest and 
important because power transferred peacefully and the rebels 
didnt win 
state department spokesman charles redman was asked whether the 
united states had reservations about the rightist victory 
our basic policy is that we dont choose sides in these kinds 
of elections redman said 
arena benefited from a huge groundswell of popular discontent 
with the christian democrats duarte defeated daubuisson for the 
presidency in 1984 on a platform that promised to end the war and 
improve the average salvadorans lot 
but the war continues unemployment is estimated at 40 percent 
and inflation is about 40 percent annually 
cristiani said sunday night his party would not present what he 
termed a systematic and capricious opposition to duarte in the 
new assembly 
we are not going to make war on duarte he added apparently 
trying to dispel speculation that arena would do everything 
possible to make the christian democrats life impossible with an 
eye to winning the 1989 presidential election 
cristiani said he and his party would try to reach agreement on 
fundamental points including how to wage the war with all parties 
represented in the legislature 
if the guerrillas do not accept the proposal we will make 
them which will be the result of a national consensus they do not 
leave any other way out but a military solution he said

republican presidential contender bob dole 
trailing george bush in wisconsin as well as nationally challenged 
bush anew to a debate on monday and won applause from a farm crowd 
for his proposal to freeze most federal spending 
later in eau claire dole called for stiffer penalties for drug 
dealers including capital punishment 
if that person is tried and convicted and found guilty i 
cant think of any penalty thats severe enough including the 
death penalty dole said weve got to set an example weve 
got to stop it were not going to do it by just a slap on the 
wrist 
vern peterson acting mayor of amery a farm community in 
northwestwern wisconsin said during doles appearance that he 
would send a debate invitation to bush this week and of course 
you mr dole are invited 
ill be here in fact maybe ill just stay here said dole 
who has unsuccessfully pressed bush for a oneonone debate for 
weeks 
bush is far ahead of dole in the race for the republican 
nomination and a poll published sunday in the milwaukee journal 
showed the vice president leading dole by nearly 3to1 among 
wisconsin voters likely to vote in wisconsins april 5 primary 
doles remarks about his proposed spending freeze drew cheers 
from more than 900 farmers who packed a small barn to hear him 
speak during farm city days 
dole said his deficitreduction plan would allow no 
exceptions except some things for lowincome americans 
that oneyear freeze will save 150 billion over three years 
no taxes no gimmicks no phony accounting just 150 billion in 
real savings dole said 
he said the freeze would give him time to negotiate a budget 
deficit reduction plan that would provide a lasting solution to the 
problem of rising federal red ink 
on another topic in an interview after he toured the festival 
grounds dole said he thought a newly proposed aid plan for 
nicaraguas contra rebels could pass the senate if brought to a 
vote but the big question is whether it can be brought to a vote 
in the senate 
dole said that although wisconsin gov tommy g thompson has 
endorsed bush the republican governor is a good example of a 
lawmaker who makes a good executive 
my opponent says bob dole is a good opponent but he doesnt 
have any executive experience governor thompson had 20 years of 
experience in the legislature and now hes governor and hes doing 
a good job of saving you money because he can go back and deal with 
the legislators he knows dole said i can do the same

the palestine liberation organization on 
monday defied a us order to shut down its un observer mission 
and washington prepared to take legal action to close it 
the general assembly meeting in its second emergency session on 
the dispute was expected to urge washington to desist from its 
efforts to close the mission 
diplomats said the assembly also would request un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to take legal action if 
necessary to protect the plo mission and provide alternative 
accommodations to its members on un international territory 
the 1987 antiterrorist act passed by congress went into effect 
monday it requires the government to close the plo mission whose 
offices are in a townhouse in new york city 
zehdi labib terzi the plos permanent representative to the 
un said he would not voluntarily close the 13yearold mission 
near park avenue as ordered by attorney general edwin meese iii 
once we see what the us government does then we will 
respond terzi said 
in washington justice department spokesman mark sheehan said in 
a telephone interview that the government probably would file suit 
tuesday in us district court in new york city seeking a court 
order to close the mission 
we will lay out our belief that continued operation of the plo 
un observer mission is in violation of the law passed by congress 
and ask the court to agree and issue an order directing him terzi 
to close down sheehan said 
he said he did not expect an immediate ruling by the court and 
the plo probably would have at least 20 days to file a response to 
the civil suit 
in a message to terzi on march 11 meese said if the mission was 
not closed voluntarily by march 21 the plo would be in violation 
of the law and a suit would be filed 
a source at the united states un mission speaking on 
condition of anonymity said if a court rules against the plo the 
government might try to render the plo mission ineffective by 
turning off electricity and water 
plo officials have said repeatedly the dispute is between the 
united states and the united nations not between washington and 
the plo 
the united nations and the plo say the 1987 antiterrorist act 
violates the 1947 un headquarters treaty by which the united 
states agreed to allow all un missions to operate 
the plo was granted observer status by the 159member world 
body which considers the organization the only legitimate 
representative of the palestinian people the plo participates in 
un debates on the middle east but does not have the right to vote 
former us attorney general ramsey clark the plos legal 
counsel has said that if the united states sues to close the plo 
mission he would seek to have the complaint dismissed on grounds 
the united states lacks jurisdiction

an 11yearold boy played with a loaded 
antitank weapon for a day and a half thinking it was a toy 
bazooka but never figured out how to fire the rocket authorities 
said monday 
weapons experts detonated the 66mm armorpiercing rocket round 
on sunday at a local gun club after the boys father alerted police 
the vietnam warera weapon has a range of more than 1000 yards 
and the projectile can pierce more than 6 inches of steel 
officials said 
had dennis grigg fired the weapon it could have exploded in 
his face because the propellant in the projectile had leaked out 
said chief deputy chris kratzer of the sangamon county sheriffs 
department 
but the boy never figured out how to operate the weapon 
investigators tried to unravel conflicting accounts about how 
the boy obtained the weapon while the army attempted to find out 
where the device came from by tracing the control numbers on the 
launcher and projectile kratzer said 
the boys father david grigg said he was working on a car 
sunday afternoon when he saw his son pointing the weapon at him 
grigg looked down the barrel saw something inside and called the 
sheriffs office 
the boy told police that he got the weapon from a friend who 
found it in his fathers pickup truck but the man mentioned by the 
boy denied involvement kratzer said

party officials and even jesse 
jacksons campaign staff were at a loss monday to explain why he 
beat michael dukakis albert gore jr and other rivals in a 
primaryday democratic straw poll 
among the republicans vice president george bush prevailed in 
his partys primary sunday in an atmosphere of confusion in which 
most polling stations did not have ballots and few republicans 
voted bush garnered all 14 national convention delegates 
you all stood in there and got the job done bush told 
supporters in a telephone call monday from air force two as he 
traveled between campaign stops in the northeast 
i have no idea why jackson won said miguel hernandez 
agosto a leader of the popular democratic party slate of delegates 
who will travel to the july presidential nominating convention in 
atlanta 
jackson never visited this island 1000 miles southeast of 
florida and never allowed himself to be pinned down on its main 
political interest should puerto rico remain a us commonwealth 
or become the 51st state 
asked why he thought jackson won press aide tom schade said in 
a telephone interview from jacksons headquarters in chicago i 
dont have an answer for that 
jacksons victory may or may not help him at the democratic 
national convention puerto ricos 56member delegation is going 
uncommitted as hernandez agosto and gov raphael henandez colon 
stressed after sundays balloting 
the straw poll was merely an expression of affection and good 
wishes for the candidates hernandez agosto said monday it 
does not commit the delegates in any way each member of the 
delegation is aware of that 
gov hernandez colon said at this time we have not made a 
decision on which us presidential candidate we are going to 
support 
the latest unofficial results showed that with 1494 of 1650 
precincts reporting or 91 percent jackson had 87757 votes or 32 
percent to 70733 votes or 26 percent for dukakis and 57639 
votes or 21 percent for illinois sen paul simon 
simon made one campaign trip here as did dukakis the 
massachusetts governor also sent a videotaped speech to pdp 
delegates in spanish noting he honeymooned in puerto rico 
among other democrats tennessee sen gore finished fourth with 
45361 votes or 17 percent missouri rep richard gephardt fifth 
with 9159 votes or 3 percent and lyndon larouche last with 3753 
votes or 1 percent 
bush swamped kansas sen bob dole 1935 votes to 48 or 98 
percent to 2 percent according to the latest unofficial results 
with 582 of 1650 stations reporting apparently just 35 percent 
dole backers tried up to the last to call off the primary and 
allocate the 14 gop delegates by caucus 
on sunday gop ballots and election material sat unused in 
trucks because no one came to distribute them to precinct stations 
local party chairman luis ferre expecting a very low turnout 
approved a plan sunday morning whereby 1650 polling stations were 
consolidated to 104 
the state election commission which conducted the election was 
not consulted about the maneuver and on monday was unsure how to 
tally republican votes the consolidation might mean that bushs 
1935 votes represent much more than 35 percent of all gop votes 
cast 
dole had no following here ferre said his supporters 
tried to stop the primary because they knew that otherwise dole 
had no chance of defeating bush 
on the democratic side 33 delegates were selected those 33 
will choose 18 more the remaining five seats in the delegation 
automatically go to party officials such as gov hernandez colon 
the main issue was not simons advocacy of statehood for this 
caribbean island of 35 million or gores defense of tax breaks 
that generate jobs here or dukakis position that federal minimum 
wage laws be applied here the main issue was control of the local 
democratic party 
the party currently is split exactly in half the popular 
democratic party of gov hernandez colon and the rival new 
progressive party of exgov carlos romero barcelo each has its own 
chairman vice chairman and national committeeman and 
committeewoman 
the entire 33member pdp delegate slate won sunday 373950 to 
297408 giving hernandez colon an islandwide base to press for 
federal patronage legislation and the political status quo whereby 
puerto ricans are us citizens with almost every right and 
obligation except they cannot vote for president and pay no federal 
taxes 
the npp favors statehood for puerto rico

democratic presidential contender jesse jackson 
pledged monday to bring an end to apartheid in south africa if 
elected 
jackson speaking at a denver high school was asked whether he 
supported a protest by university of colorado students against the 
universitys investment with a company that has south africa 
holdings 
i support the ambition of those students said jackson a 
university must maintain a moral integrity and should not invest 
in south africa 
broadening his statements to include us policy toward south 
africa jackson said it doesnt make much sense to mine harbors 
in nicaragua and send troops to honduras in the name of open and 
free elections and then say nothing when south africa locks up 
labor leaders and kills innocent men women and children 
the integrity of our nation is at stake he said 
jackson said pressure and sanctions by the united states and its 
allies could end apartheid 
the sure way to end apartheid in south africa is to elect 
jesse jackson president he said 
jackson who has made antidrug comments a part of most campaign 
appearances exhorted the students at george washington high school 
to stay away from drugs 
he also urged the students to participate in colorados precinct 
caucuses april 4 noting that they coincide with the 20th 
anniversary of martin luther king jrs assassination 
since gary hart is not in the race let me be colorados 
favorite son said jackson who later met briefly with hart at 
stapleton international airport hart withdrew from the 
presidential race for the second time march 11 
i have appealed to him hart for help in our campaign to give 
assistance in the direction of policy development and he will help 
do so jackson told reporters after meeting with hart 
hart said this did not mean he was endorsing jackson direct 
endorsements are oldfashioned he said i cant deliver any 
votes to jesse 
but he said he was willing to work with jackson or any 
democratic candidate on policy matters 
i think the best assistance i can give him or any other 
candidate for president is in the area of policies said hart 
i want to work very closely with jesse and his people to help him 
develop a policy to govern this country

a us military helicopter crashed 
monday during a training exercise near the honduran town of 
juticalpa and all 10 american soldiers aboard were injured us 
officials reported 
maj gary hovatter spokesman for the american forces sent to 
honduras last week said the uh1 huey helicopter went down at 
about 1 pm est and he called the crash an accident 
in washington pentagon spokesman lt cmdr mel sundin said 
there were 10 people aboard the helicopter not nine as previously 
thought their injuries did not appear to be serious 
all are in good to excellent condition sundin said he 
added that those aboard the chopper were american soldiers but did 
not have further details 
capt nancy laluntas a pentagon spokeswoman said earlier that 
there were no reports of fatalities she said other helicopters 
evacuated the victims for medical treatment but it was not clear 
where they were taken 
one pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the cause of the crash appeared to be mechanical 
hovatter said the helicopter was taking part in an exercise 
called golden pheasant which was launched after 3200 us 
soldiers arrived in honduras last week 
president reagan sent the troops as a warning to nicaragua after 
us and honduran officials said nicaraguan soldiers crossed into 
honduras to attack base camps of usbacked nicaraguan rebels 
neither hovatter nor laluntas gave further information on the 
injured soldiers because the victims relatives had not yet been 
notified 
the officers said the helicopter crashed about six miles south

deceptive marketing by bell of 
pennsylvania results in many customers paying for optional 
telephone services they dont want or need state officials charged 
monday 
in a joint announcement attorney general leroy zimmerman and 
consumer advocate david barasch said bell has been engaged in a 
longstanding sales practice that misleads customers about service 
options in some cases they said lowerincome residents were 
saddled with costly extras 
the attorney general and consumer advocate filed separate but 
related legal actions to restrain bell from using the allegedly 
illegal marketing practices to make refunds to customers and to 
pay civil penalties 
in many cases bell representatives assign services such as 
call waiting and wire maintenance plans without ever telling the 
consumer that the services are optional zimmerman said during a 
news conference 
bell the states largest telephone company said the 
allegations were unjustified and an affront to its employees 
regis f filtz bell vice president and chief operating officer 
said company representatives often spend a halfhour or an hour 
with customers to ensure they make informed choices 
certainly we sell but we have no interest in overselling or 
selling services by misleading customers as to the cost value or 
benefits of our services filtz said 
bell serves about 37 million customers representing about 80 
percent of the states telephone lines 
barasch said consumers have spent about 176 million on bells 
optional services since 1984 but he was unable to determine how 
many customers may have been mislead about the charges optional 
services include touchtone service call forwarding call waiting 
threeway calling and speed calling 
the allegations were based on 32 test calls made to bell 
representatives by agents posing as customers 
in one test call an agent identifying herself as a single 
mother living on welfare was assigned a package of services costing 
2855 monthly when basic phone service could be obtained for 
665 per month officials said 
of the callers more than 70 percent were assigned up to three 
optional services they had not requested or were not told were 
optional officials said threequarters of the callers were 
assigned touchtone service without requesting it or without being 
told it was optional they said 
in a complaint filed with the public utility commission barasch 
labeled the sales practices unlawful unfair and deceptive 
besides the penalties and refunds barasch also asks the commission 
to force the company to set up new procedures for initiating and 
reestablishing service 
zimmerman in a suit filed in commonwealth court asks that the 
company be assessed civil penalties for violating 
consumerprotection laws 
barasch estimated the company would have to pay many millions 
of dollars in refunds and fines

secretary of state george p shultz opened 
wideranging talks monday in which he intends to confront visiting 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze about massive soviet 
arms shipments to central america 
they met for 90 minutes to set their agenda for the next two 
days also shevardnadze told reporters he had a very general 
review of the international situation with shultz 
the dispute over central america appeared unlikely to spoil 
progress in efforts to reduce us and soviet nuclear arms or 
preparations for the next superpower summit meeting in moscow 
shevardnadze was expected to offer a latemay summit date and to 
have it accepted by president reagan after they meet wednesday at 
the white house 
the soviet foreign minister called his first session with shultz 
organizational asked if a date for the summit would be set 
during his visit shevardnadze said i think so 
a treaty to slash us and soviet armories of longrange nuclear 
arms by 30 percent to 50 percent is the projected centerpiece of 
reagans fourth meeting with general secretary mikhail s gorbachev 
while shultz said sunday the agreement was not yet in the 
bag us and soviet experts will try to square drafts of their 
treaty proposals during shevardnadzes threeday visit 
but the wars in nicaragua and afghanistan cast a cloud on the 
presummit preprarations 
assistant secretary of state rozanne l ridgway and state 
department spokesman charles e redman accused moscow of an 
unceasing supply of weapons to the leftist government in nicaragua 
apparently referring also to the reported supply of soviet 
rifles and other arms to embattled panamanian strongman manuel 
antonio noriega from cuba ms ridgway said what we need now is 
an end to the continued soviet provision of these high levels of 
military equipment 
redman meanwhile accused the soviets of shipping more than 
3000 tons of equipment to nicaragua in january and february alone 
for a number of years the soviets have supplied nicaragua with 
500 million to 600 million in assistance annually he said i 
certainly dont see it as an issue heating up redman said but 
soviet military support is a continuing cause for concern 
in afghanistan meanwhile the united states has been arming 
rebels fighting a marxist government backed by an estimated 120000 
soviet troops and weapons 
the united states is demanding the soviets withdraw the troops 
and also end the aid negotiations between afghanistan and pakistan 
reached an impasse last week but shultz evidently was not prepared 
to seek a compromise solution with shevardnadze 
theyre the ones who got into afghanistan and the ones who 
have to figure out how they are going to get out ms ridgway 
said 
reagan at a white house ceremony to sign an afghanistan day 
proclamation approved by congress said 
we may be approaching an historic moment we all hope that 
what we hear from moscow means there will be a complete and 
irreversible withdrawal of all the soviet forces from afghanistan 
that the afghan people will be able to freely determine their own 
future and that the millions of refugees can return to their homes 
with dignity 
shultzs first session with shevardnadze dealt primarily with 
setting an agenda for their talks on tuesday and wednesday they 
will take up four main issues arms control human rights regional 
disputes and ussoviet relations generally 
that is the traditional lineup for what has become monthly 
meetings between shultz and shevardnadze alternating between 
washington and moscow 
but in a novel break with tradition instead of scheduling a 
formal dinner tuesday night shultz arranged a buffet at the state 
department simultaneously with the showing in the ben franklin 
reception room of the movie thats entertainment 
and tuesday morning a new riskreduction center will be 
opened at the state department to provide quicker communication 
between the two capitals in order to avoid accidental nuclear war 
a formal agreement was signed here last september a center is 
being established in moscow as well 
satellite links will transmit information between the two 
capitals augmenting an existing telecommunications hotline

lawmen along the texas coast braced 
for another wave of tourists monday after a wild weekend that 
included a riot four stabbings and two drownings 
hundreds of sailors will flood the coast near galveston this 
week when their ships dock navy officials said as law officers in 
the surrounding areas made plans to bolster their forces 
were going to have to have more law enforcement said jp 
luby a county commissioner whose district includes nearly 20 miles 
of public beaches 
we want the spring breakers to have a good time but things 
should be worked out so that we have a better understanding of the 
problems he said 
over the weekend eight spring break revelers were arrested 
following a latenight riot four stabbings and several drunken 
driving incidents two san antonio men were killed when their car 
crashed through a flashing barrier and plunged off a ferry dock 
sinking in 20 to 25 feet of water 
we had 35 units patrolling the area of port aransas and the 
padre island national seashore but at night there are not as many 
to go around luby said the department of public safety had 18 
officers out and that wasnt enough 
luby said he and constables police and emergency workers met 
two weeks ago to prepare for the onslaught of college students 
converging on corpus christiarea beaches 
but no one was prepared for the fracas that erupted saturday 
night on nearby mustang island he said 
the melee erupted shortly before midnight when a motorist struck 
a 16yearold girl on the beach and then attempted to leave said 
police chief don perkins angry youths began to attack the driver 
but he was pulled away by police 
the mob tipped over his car smashed in the windows and set it 
and a nearby portable toilet afire police said 
police estimated there were 3000 rioters and about 100 officers 
on hand officials used tear gas and helicopters with search lights 
to quell the uproar 
two law enforcement officers were injured in the melee four 
people were stabbed in unrelated attacks police said 
the real problem is we have 21 miles of beach in nueces 
county and port aransas has 3 miles and everyone congregates in an 
area of about 1 to 2 miles of beach luby said youve got too 
many people in a small area 
authorities said it was calm along the beach monday 
still there is one more weekend of large crowds expected for 
spring break before the easter weekend when more tourists are 
expected 
in galveston 230 miles to the northeast of here officials say 
1650 sailors from the uss lexington and two other navy ships will 
be mixing with the students 
navy spokesman lt jim fallon in dallas said the training vessel 
uss lexington the submarine rescue platform ship uss petrel and a 
research submarine will be berthed at galveston on tuesday through

will be off the ships at one time

the world bank is asking its 151 member 
governments for an additional 224 billion in cash including 420 
million from the united states in order to raise lending to poor 
countries the banks president said monday 
the bank now lends about 14 billion a year at current rates of 
interest though for much longer periods than commercial banks 
usually do it lends an additional 3 billion annually on even 
easier terms to the poorest countries 
the new cash represents 3 percent of the banks recently 
announced 748 billion increase in capital which has been 
approved by the member governments the rest of the money would be 
on call in case the bank fell short of funds but it has never had 
to use any of its on call money in more than 40 years of 
operations 
the united states is being asked for the biggest single share of 
the new capital increase 14 billion of which 420 million would 
be in cash and the rest on call because the cash would be spread 
out over five or six years the administration is now asking 
congress for a first 70 million 
but as a former congressman who well remembers senator everett 
dirksens description of the appropriations process as a billion 
dollars here a billion dollars there and pretty soon youre 
talking about real money i do not expect or want automatic 
approval of this capital increase said bank president barber b 
conable a former republican congressman from new york 
conable said that as needs have grown in the third world 
resources to meet them have not kept pace 
he noted that in the previous five years there had been a flow 
of 65 billion from the industrial countries to the poor ones 
the reversal amounts to a crisis for development one that 
puts a duty on the world bank to be even more vigorous as an honest 
broker between rich and poor he said 
conables speech was prepared for delivery in san francisco to 
the world affairs council of northern california copies were 
distributed to reporters by the banks headquarters in washington

three former du pont co employees 
suffering from exposure to asbestos pledged monday to give 90 
percent of a 75 million award in punitive damages to six 
institutions 
william kapp jr of elkton md one of the victims and 
spokesman for the group said the 675 million if the damage 
award is upheld on appeal will be donated to try to help our 
fellow asbestos victims as well as to help assure that this kind 
of corporate abuse of public trust will never happen again 
this is just our way of putting the punitive damages award to 
its highest purposes kapp said 
in november a superior court jury awarded kapp 55 james webb 
74 of newport and joseph kaster 71 of the newport area and 
their wives what has been called the secondlargest personal injury 
award in us history against raymark industries inc of trumbull 
conn 
the jury supported claims that raymark formerly raybestos 
manhattan inc conspired with the former johns manville corp now 
manville corp to suppress information relating to the health 
hazards of asbestos and failing to place warnings on their products 
raymark manufactured asbestos that the men worked around for 
more than 25 years at du ponts newport plant previous state court 
rulings had barred liability of employers in such cases 
in addition to the punitive damage award the men were awarded 
more than 1 million in actual damages for personal injury they 
said they had contracted lung disorders linked to breathing 
asbestos fibers six codefendants settled the case 
there are 350 similar cases pending against raymark in delaware 
the inhalation of asbestos once commonly used in building 
insulation and other products has been linked to cancer and other 
diseases 
the national campaign against toxic hazards a toxic victims 
advocacy group was earmarked to receive 13 million of the 675 
million 
the bostonbased groups organizing director peter obstler said 
the money would be used to continue to provide staff and 
technical assistance to victims of toxic chemicals 
but kapp stressed that the money may never be awarded 
both sides are awaiting a decision from judge clarence w taylor 
on whether to uphold the award if it is upheld raymark will 
appeal according to legrande l young raymark general counsel 
kapp who employed by du pont for 33 years before he became too 
ill to work said he was hoping the move to donate the money to 
charity would persuade taylor to uphold the 75 million award 
young said he did not think the judge could be swayed either 
its an appropriate judgment or its not he said 
the other institutions targeted for part of the award at 13 
million each are the mount sinai school of environmental medicine 
in new york the university of delaware school of business to 
establish a chair to advance the study of business ethics the 
medical center of delawares carpenter clinic for cancer research 
and the white lung association a baltimorebased organization of 
asbestos victims 
an additional 25 million was pledged to the emily p bissell 
hospital for the critically ill in newport 
the largest jury award is believed to be 1278 million to an 
orange county calif teenager who sued ford motor co over burns 
he received when the gasoline tank of his 1972 pinto exploded

the sandinista government and 
usbacked rebels on monday opened three days of talks in this 
border town by exchanging ceasefire proposals and agreeing to a 
truce during the negotiations 
neither side seeks a military victory over the other said 
alfredo cesar head of the rebel delegation after the completion 
of the first day of talks the first facetoface negotiations on 
nicaraguan soil 
he said the contra rebels proposed a 30day ceasefire and 
continuous talks to reach a permanent truce 
cesar told reporters the contras also proposed total amnesty and 
guarantees of free expression to lead toward reconciliation he 
called mondays talks which were behind closed doors a step 
ahead 
defense minister humberto ortega leader of the government 
delegation said he proposed an immediate and definitive 
ceasefire he did not elaborate 
the rebels battered by a twoweekold sandinista offensive 
agreed to accept a truce for the duration of the negotiations in 
what contra spokesman bosco matamoros called a gesture of good 
will 
frank arana another contra spokesman said the two sides 
discussed military and political issues including concepts of 
democracy 
if so it would be the first time the sandinistas consented to 
discuss political issues with the rebels 
in two rounds of indirect talks in the dominican republic and 
costa rica the sandinistas demanded the negotiations deal 
exclusively on the mechanics of a ceasefire 
negotiations opened after ortega brother of president daniel 
ortega said the sandinistas were suspending military operations 
for the duration of the talks and called on the contras to do the 
same 
sandinista spokesman manuel espinoza said the reciprocation of 
the contras in agreeing to suspend hostilities and the fact 
that this meeting is taking place are the first positive steps 
toward a permanent ceasefire he spoke to reporters during the 
lunch break 
the rebels entered the talks in this small town on the border 
with costa rica without high expectations of sandinista concessions 
cesar told reporters earlier that he feared the rebels were 
being weakened by the suspension of united states aid and the 
growth in soviet aid to the sandinistas 
unlike the two previous rounds of negotiations the sapoa agenda 
was supposed to be open on sunday however sandinista officials 
said they would focus on a ceasefire in the civil war which began 
in 1981 and has cost an estimated 40000 lives 
cheering sandinista supporters calling for a contra 
surrender lined both sides of the 90mile road the government 
delegation traveled from managua to sapoa the contras arrived from 
costa rica 
soldiers and security agents in plainclothes guarded sapoa 
security was especially tight at the customs house where the talks 
were being held 
with the sandinista were brian wilson an american pacifist 
whose legs were severed by a train in califoria during a protest 
last year and singeractor kris kristofferson both are sandinista 
supporters of long standing 
the contras made cesar once a high sandinista official head of 
their delegation in hopes of gaining benefit from his familiarity 
with the sandinistas 
cesar said he last visited sapoa as a sandinista revolutionary 
fighting the late president anastasio somoza who was overthrown in 
july 1979 
it has been nine years since i was last in sapoa and i am 
still struggling for the freedom of nicaragua he said cesar 
broke with the sandinistas in 1982 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo nicaraguas roman catholic 
prelate who mediated earlier talks and joao baena soares general 
secretary of the organization of american states attended the 
meeting as observers 
ceasefire talks are required under the peace plan signed by the 
presidents of nicaragua honduras costa rica el salvador and 
guatemala last august among other provisions are amnesties 
greater democracy and an end to the use of one nations territory 
for attacks on another

gov evan mechams lawyer in an abrupt 
role change became a witness in his clients impeachment trial 
monday saying the only political option advisers offered the 
governor was to go down with the ship 
fred craft who was subpoenaed by the senate on a motion by 
democratic minority leader sen alan stephens made the comment 
during crossexamination by prosecutor paul eckstein 
craft and his cocounsel jerris leonard objected to the 
crossexamination saying that only senators were supposed to 
question a lawyer called as a witness under such unusual 
circumstances the presiding officer disagreed 
eckstein asked whether craft ever advised mecham to resign 
ive talked to the governoer a lot said craft sometimes 
ive said governor why are you doiing this to yourself 
without answering directly he recalled mecham advisers 
brainstorming about the governors political options 
we had these meetings and no one could see a political escape 
route for the governor craft said no one was offering the 
governor any other political option than to go down with the ship 
craft now one of mechams lawyers in the impeachment case was 
a washington lobbyist for mecham and an adviser to the firstterm 
republican 
the senate which began its fourth week of inquiry into the 
governors actions monday has been hearing testimony on an 
allegation that mecham tried to obstruct justice by thwarting an 
attorney generals probe of the alleged death threat against former 
mecham aide donna carlson 
the obstruction of justice charge is one of three broad 
allegations against mecham at the trial he also is charged with 
concealing a 350000 campaign loan and with misusing 80000 from 
a state fund by loaning it to his auto dealership 
earlier craft corroborated mechams assertions that he was not 
informed that a death threat had been made against a former aide 
craft testified he stood next to mecham when a state police 
officer first reported the alleged threat craft said it was 
reported as an altercation between two employees 
i never heard felony i never heard death threat and i 
certainly never heard tampering with a grand jury witness 
craft said in an almost exact duplicate of mechams own testimony 
last week 
at the time of the alleged threat last november ms carlson was 
preparing to testify before a grand jury investigating mechams 
campaign finances 
like mecham craft accused lt beau johnson of the department of 
public safety of testifying falsely when he said he alerted mecham 
to a possible felony tampering with a grand jury witness 
craft swore johnson never gave that warning 
i dont remember so much what he said as what he did not say 
because im a trained lawyer said craft if he had said 
those words my antennae would have gone up 
johnson has said he went to mecham and told him that a mecham 
aide lee watkins had threatened mrs carlson and that a possible 
felony was involved mecham has denied this version saying he 
understood two employees had a disagreement and that he referred it 
to watkins superior max hawkins 
senators supported stephens motion to have craft testify 
because he was mentioned by other witnesses as participating in key 
conversations craft said he did not give the governor legal advice 
during that period and acknowledged he could not claim an 
attorneyclient privilege of confidentiality 
craft took the stand after peggy griffith he official who 
reported hearing the alleged threat against ms carlson said she 
was told mecham blamed her for getting him in hot water 
mrs griffith returning to testify as a prosecution rebuttal 
witness said she was told by her secretary terri fields that the 
governor and his thenlawyer murray miller were mad at mrs 
griffith 
she came in and was very tearful and agitated mrs griffith 
said of ms fields she saidi cant stand it anymore im going 
to quit theyre hounding me the governor and murray miller 
they said its all your fault peggy they said if you had not 
told the governor would not be in hot water and its all your 
fault 
mrs griffith a strong mecham supporter said that was a gut 
blow 
it would take a twothirds vote of the 30 senators to convict 
mecham they could then take another vote and forbid mecham to ever 
hold state office again 
mecham the first us governor to be impeached in 60 years 
also faces an april 21 criminal trial on felony charges of 
concealing the 350000 loan and a recall election may 17 
mecham who friday completed three days of testimony was absent 
from the trial monday

king hussein on monday urged the moslem 
world to support the revolt in the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza strip where more than 100 palestinians and an israeli soldier 
have been killed since dec 8 
opening a meeting of foreign ministers of the 46member 
organization of islamic conference the jordanian monarch also 
expressed hope that iran would agree to a ceasefire in its war 
with iraq 
the iranian envoy to the conference mohammed ali tashkiri told 
reporters that his nation would accept the help of any truthful 
hand that tried to end the devastating iraniraq missile duel on 
each others cities 
at the united nations monday iraqs un ambassador accused 
iraq of using chemical weapons which he said killed 5000 people 
and wounded 5000 in kurdish border cities inside iran 
king hussein told the conference in his opening address the 
palestinian people have a rightful claim on us to support their 
uprising both on the national and international level so that the 
uprising in the occupied territories may bear fruit 
the king did not elaborate on what forms aid should take but 
asked the ministers to support an international conference on 
middle east peace 
sharifuddin pir zadeh secretarygeneral of the islamic 
conference said earlier that protesters in the israelioccupied 
territories should be supported financially and morally 
hussein said the palestinian were heroically fighting for 
their freedom and national rights and defying in their uprising the 
arrogance of the forces of occupation 
he said there should be a seat for the palestine liberation 
organization at an international peace conference which would 
involve the parties to the conflict and the five permanent members 
of the un security council the united states soviet union 
britain france and china 
by calling for a plo seat at the conference hussein set himself 
apart from us peace proposals which he discussed in amman on 
sunday with us envoy philip habib the us plan does not call 
for a plo seat at the conference 
the uprising of the palestinian people is not an end in itself 
nor is it a transient coincidental event that will soon wither 
away hussein said it is rather an expression of the will of 
an entire nation to fight for its freedom and right of 
selfdetermination in its own land 
the rebellion in the occupied territories which palestinians 
call the uprising and the iraniraq war dominate the agenda of 
the meeting at which all members of the conference except chad are 
represented 
king hussein who supports iraq in the war called the conflict 
a deep wound in the body of the moslem world that is bleeding 
and draining our resources and energies 
our hope is that iran will accept security council 
resolution 598 which represents the will of the international 
community he said 
the resolution passed last july provides for a ceasefire and 
return to prewar borders 
iraq has said it will stop shooting if iran does but the 
iranians demand that iraq be named the aggressor before a truce 
takes effect iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after several 
border skirmishes 
tashkiri who heads the foreign relations department in irans 
ministry of information and religious guidance told journalists 
that he would attempt to get the conference to discuss the missile 
duel 
we support a halt in the war of the cities and we will back 
any truthful hand that tries to stop it he said 
the relatively lowranking level of the iranian delegation in 
amman appeared to make it unlikely such negotiations would start at 
the conference 
irans un ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati accused iraq 
of sending planes to bombard border cities with nerve gas on a 
scale unprecedented in the persian gulf war and also of 
employing mustard gas and cyanide gas in a campaign that began 
march 17 
iraqs ambassador ismat taha kittani refused comment 
mahallatti asked the un security council to denounce iraq to 
send a factfinding team to verify his claims and to mobilize the 
world health organization and similar agencies to aid victims

ira gunmen killed a policeman 
monday at a checkpoint in londonderry the 12th victim in two weeks 
of heightening tension and sectarian violence 
britain announced a massive manhunt in west belfasts roman 
catholic ghettos for the killers of two british soldiers caught in 
an ira funeral procession 
northern ireland secretary tom king said in london that the 
royal ulster constabulary has launched an immediate review of its 
new policy of keeping a low profile at irish republican army 
funerals the policy was aimed at avoiding clashes between police 
and supporters of the outlawed ira 
the policeman who was killed monday clive graham 25 was shot 
in the head in a jeep while at a checkpoint in the roman catholic 
creggan district of londonderry northern irelands secondlargest 
city he died later in the hospital 
the ira claimed responsibility for grahams killing in a 
clandestine message to belfast media 
he was the 12th person to die since march 6 when british 
commandos shot dead three ira guerrillas who allegedly were 
plotting a car bombing in gibraltar 
the funeral policy was started wednesday at services for the 
guerrillas killed in gibraltar a protestant gunman opened fire and 
hurled grenades at the catholic milltown cemetery killing three 
people and wounding 68 
kings announcement of a review of the policy stopped well short 
of demands by leaders of northern ireland protestant parties to 
return to a heavy presence at ira funerals 
as expectations grew of an imminent wave of arrests in west 
belfast there was also speculation that dozens of ira supporters 
who were filmed surrounding and beating the soldiers unmarked car 
with iron bars and dragging them out had gone into hiding 
a massive murder investigation is under way in which all 
possible resources are involved to identify all those 
responsible king said of the manhunt in west belfast 
three people were arrested saturday and police sources said 
monday that up to 30 others were being sought after hours of 
scrutiny of film taken by an army helicopter which hovered over the 
scene and by tv networks gruesome scenes of the attack also were 
shown on television 
cpls derek wood and david howes in plainclothes were 
surrounded when they drove up to the cortege dragged from their 
car stripped beaten and shot dead 
king said an emergency meeting of senior government ministers 
from britain and the republic of ireland will be held this week to 
consider stepped up security 
king denied charges by northern ireland protestant politicians 
that police and troops failed to come to the soldiers aid because 
of political orders to stay away from ira funerals 
he said it was not immediately clear to police watching film 
relayed from the helicopter that soldiers were under attack because 
police were certain there were no security forces in the area 
whatsoever 
he said the soldiers were under general orders to keep out of 
catholic districts unless on operational duty and had no reason 
to be in the vicinity of the funerals he said he did not know 
why they were there 
as the commons listened in silence king praised the corporals 
identified as signals corpsmen heading back to barracks after doing 
maintenance work at a base in belfast for their restraint in 
firing only one shot into the mob that surrounded them 
the truth is that there will be new depths of horror again 
as long as this awful and evil campaign of terrorism and revenge 
continues king said 
it has got to stop in the name of humanity and if there is to 
be any decent future for the people of northern ireland and for all 
those living in the island of ireland and if the evil shroud of 
terrorism is to be lifted from the united kingdom as whole 
since 1969 2638 people have been killed in the sectarian 
violence in this protestantdominated province the ira is fighting 
to end british rule and unite northern ireland with the catholic 
republic of ireland under a leftist administration

warning that louisiana is in a 
terrifying financial crisis gov buddy roemer on monday told 
the legislature that he must have unprecedented authority to make 
budget cuts in order to keep the state afloat 
we must build on the foundation of a balanced budget roemer 
said in his address before lawmakers called into special session 
although the governor said the first step would be to cut 
spending he said tax increases would be necessary later 
roemer said the state faces a more than 2 billion problem 
including a 210 million cashflow shortage that could shut down 
government within 50 days a projected 756 million deficit for the 
198889 fiscal year and an accumulated debt of 13 billion 
we inherited a mess a real unbelievable mess the governor 
said 
roemer asked lawmakers to give him the authority to cut up to 20 
percent from each department and eliminate entire state programs 
through the rest of the fiscal year ending june 30 
i must have the power to make decisions and accelerate the 
decisionmaking process he said 
the governor said that if thengov edwin edwards had accepted 
100 million in budget cuts that roemer proposed during the 
transition the cashflow problem would have been averted 
time is eating us alive he said 
roemer said the legislature could reverse any budget decisions 
he makes when lawmakers convene for their regular session in april 
adding i am not requesting that you abdicate your responsibility 
in the budget process 
the special session would center around solving the shortterm 
cash problem and laying the groundwork for paying off the 
accumulated debt budget cuts made now will translate into savings 
in the next fiscal year he said 
as part of a government reorganization plan to save money 
roemer asked lawmakers to divide the department of health and human 
resources into two agencies eliminate the department of urban and 
community affairs and forgive loans taken from dedicated or 
specialuse funds to keep the state operating 
besides eliminating the entire urban affairs department which 
would require separate legislative action roemer did not cite 
specifically what state programs he wanted to eliminate but he 
said some state institutions may have to be closed 
tax increases and borrowing alone without budget cuts will not 
solve the financial problem and will hamper efforts to attract new 
business and industry to louisiana roemer warned 
more borrowing or new taxes are not now the answer he said 
we will need to do both eventually but each action must be 
carefully thought out and precisely planned 
roemer said his administration already had taken steps to save 
214 million through such steps as better utilization of state 
office space reducing the number of state vehicles by a third 
limiting bond issues for major construction projects and the 
elimination of positions held by political appointees 
the regular legislative session will concern itself with plans 
to pay off the longterm debt an overhaul of the states tax 
system a balanced budget for 198788 education and environmental 
changes and a plan to diversify the states economy roemer said 
the ability to attract new business to louisiana will depend 
upon our willingness to make tough decisions the governor said 
i did not expect nor did i ask for this perilous economic 
situation but i am prepared to lead us through these tough times 
in such a way that we protect essential services and we avoid 
having to make these choices over and over and over again it will 
not be easy he said 
after the house and senate convened shortly after 5 pm 
administrationbacked bills aimed at slashing state spending and 
reorganizing government were introduced in both chambers 
in the house legislation was put forth to give roemer the 
temporary authority he wants to cut spending 
there was also a proposal for a statewide lottery to pay off 
bonds that would be used to finance the states accumulated budget 
deficit once the deficit was paid off further proceeds would go 
to education health care and local governments according to the 
bill roemer has voiced opposition to a lottery 
also referred to a senate committee were bills to transfer the 
functions of some agencies to other departments reduce the 
interest rate on some refunds and payments being delayed by the 
governor in order to save cash and abolish most special funds in 
the state treasury

sudden operations is most unsatisfactory for longterm coverage 
as in the persian gulf he said 
he described as a step in the right direction a new law that 
restricts the governments right to refuse entry to foreigners 
because of any past current or expected beliefs or associations 
which if engaged in by a us citizen in the united states would 
be protected under the constitution of the united states 
according to day iapa sought the congressional action after the 
immigration and naturalization service refused entry to patricia 
lara a reporter for el tiempo in bogota the government contended 
she was a member of the leftist m19 guerrillas which she denied 
day said the new law represents progress but the government 
still may use reasons of foreign policy or national security to 
deny entry to people linked to terrorist actions or activities 
i myself fear that the government might use these exceptions 
to keep people arbitrarily out of the country he said it 
seems to me that patricia lara could still be denied admission 
under the law 
another problem with the law is that it applies only for the 
remainder of the reagan administration he said day said iapa 
mainly through the efforts of edward seaton of seaton newspapers in 
manhattan kan took the lead in pressing for legislation and 
should try to strengthen and extend it 
day applauded a supreme court ruling in february guaranteeing 
parodists caricaturists and other amusing rascals the same 
first amendment protections as the more sobersided members of 
the press have in its ruling on the rev jerry falwells damage 
suit against hustler magazine 
the magazine published a phony advertisement depicting falwell 
leader of the moral majority in what the court described as a 
drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother it said public 
figures have many ways of protecting themselves against vitriolic 
criticism and tasteless parodies without suing their critics 
so we in the united states are in debt to hustler magazine 
day said as a matter of fact the supreme court decision is 
welcome financially as well as morally its decision greatly 
inhibits the filing of libel suits 
arias told the committee journalists work under constant 
threats in panama where there is no freedom of the press and 
there wont be until the dicatorship of gen noriega ends 
several foreign journalists have been detained or refused entry 
to panama where noriega is the power behind the civilian 
government as chief of the 15000 defense forces 
noriega has been indicted on drug charges in florida the united 
states has cut off the flow of cash to his country and the reagan 
administration is trying to force him into exile 
panama has been hijacked by drug traffickers who are capable 
of shutting down the canal at any moment arias said 
for a dictatorship accused of drug trafficking hostile to 
humanity hostile to all democratic and civilized forces it is not 
difficult to sink a ship at the entrance of the panama canal 
he and other speakers said much of the threat to the press in 
latin america is linked to the regions drug traffic

a state board delayed a decision 
monday on whether to parole former black panther johnny spain who 
earlier this month was freed after 21 years in prison for murder 
the full state board of prison terms voted unanimously to have 
one of its smaller threemember panels reconsider parole of the 
san quentin six member even though he was released from 
vacaville state prison march 10 on court orders that required 
350000 bail 
spain who lives in san francisco and is preparing to go to work 
as an electrician a trade he learned behind bars had been in 
prison since december 1966 on a conviction of murdering a man he 
was trying to rob in los angeles 
in 1976 he became the only prisoner convicted of murder in an 
august 1971 bloodbath at san quentin prison the worst in state 
prison history that took the lives of militant leader george 
jackson two other prisoners and three guards 
the san quentin conviction was overturned in 1986 and a new 
trial ordered a ruling the state is appealing 
in february a threemember panel voted 21 to grant parole in 
1989 on the 1966 murder charge the dissenting member however 
asked the full board to review the decision 
earlier this month however a superior court judge in los 
angeles citing technical irregularities in earlier parole 
hearings ordered spain released on parole immediately 
that ruling cleared the way for spains release on bail pending 
the states appeal of the order for a new trial in the san quentin 
case 
the parole boards chief legal counsel william cashdollar said 
the new hearing would take place within 45 days in effect 
canceling the february ruling to grant parole in 1989 
cashdollar refused to provide any further details of their 
reasoning during mondays closed board hearing and said the board 
was complying fully with court orders but also continuing to 
comply with the statutes that establish our responsibilities 
regarding parole of inmates 
its a unique situation cashdollar said most of the 
individuals are in custody when we are making our determinations 
spains attorney dennis riordan criticized what he called the 
boards decision to reconsider whether he should have any parole 
date at all 
riordan said the board would have to obtain a court order to 
enforce any move to return spain to prison between now and the time 
his parole is reconsidered a move that riordan said he would fight 
theyve never been confronted by this situation before and 
they are confused by it he said 
board of prison terms spokeswoman phyllis scott said all options 
regarding spains immediate future would be discussed with the 
state attorney generals office including the possibility that it 
would seek to return him to prison 
assistant attorney general alan ashby refused to comment on the 
case

vice president george bush indicated monday he 
supported president reagans veto of a major civil rights bill 
even as the house and senate were poised to override the 
presidents action 
the legislation is imperfect and the imperfections should 
be corrected the vice president who is seeking the republican 
presidential nomination said in remarks to a group of black 
supporters in washington 
until now the vice president had avoided direct comment on 
whether he supported reagans veto but as he campaigned in 
hartford conn he told reporters who asked him about it im 
not going to start differing with the president now 
im not going to start doing now what i havent been doing for 
seven years finding differences with the president for whom i 
have great respect he told the group in washington which 
applauded enthusiastically his remarks about the bill 
the civil rights restoration act passed both chambers earlier 
this year by large margins both supporters and opponents of the 
measure said there was little chance the veto would be sustained 
the measure would forbid the distribution of federal funds to 
entire institutions state and local government agencies and many 
corporations if any part of them practices discrimination 
it was prompted by a 1984 supreme court ruling that civil rights 
laws applied only to a specific program or activity receiving 
federal aid under the decision for example the government could 
not cut off money to a college if the discrimination occurred in a 
department that did not receive such aid 
supporters of the measure say it restores civil rights laws to 
the way they were interpreted before the court challenge mounted by 
tiny grove city college in pennsylvania 
bush criticized the measure but added having said that 
however the federal government must require that organizations 
that get tax dollars comply with our civil rights laws 
he said in hartford that he believed the president should have 
lineitem veto powers so he could take some of the extremes out 
of a piece of legislation 
the reagan administration has called for an alternative bill 
similar to an earlier republican plan voted down in congress which 
would grant religious schools and organizations as well as 
corporations more exemptions from civil rights laws 
earlier monday bush picked up endorsements from gov thomas h 
kean and new jerseys county republican chairmen a gain that one 
chairman said was like winning the states presidential primary 
we republicans have had a spirited campaign weve heard good 
ideas from jack kemp from bob dole from pete du pont from al 
haig and from pat robertson now its time for our party to come 
together said kean with bush by his side 
george bush is our leader and with the republican vision of a 
stronger america that offers opportunity to all regardless of color 
or creed we can not only retain the presidency but send house 
speaker jim wright to the back benches for the rest of this 
century kean said 
the popular governor abandoned his neutrality one week after 
bush won the illinois primary taking a commanding lead for the 
republican nomination 
new jerseys 21 county republican chairmen who had been waiting 
for kean to act followed the governors lead and voted to endorse 
bush at a breakfast meeting monday 
kean also campaigned monday with the vice president in 
connecticut which holds its presidential primary next tuesday 
in bloomfield conn the vice president whose father was a 
us senator from conecticut and whose brother and mother still 
live in greenwich said i dont want to be beaten in this 
state 
were taking nothing for granted theres no arrogance factor 
no overconfidence certainly bush said 
bush was also asked about a possible pardon for former national 
security adviser john poindexter and former white house aide oliver 
north who have been indicted in connection with the irancontra 
affair 
pardon imputes guilt it seems to me a pardon for something 
that has not been established the vice president said the 
system has to work it will work 
in new jersey assemblyman richard kamin the morris county gop 
chairman said the endorsements were like winning the states 
presidential primary almost assuring that bush will win new 
jerseys 64 republican delegates the states primary is june 7 
it is significant to have them at this point when you have 
your opponent still vowing to go on kamin said 
in his endorsement speech kean cited two themes he has embraced 
as governor the need to improve education and the need for 
republicans to practice the politics of inclusion by reaching 
out to blacks and others not usually in the partys fold 
the governor said bush wants to be the education president 
and he said bush doesnt just talk about expanding the republican 
party he has been doing it for more than 20 years

democrats albert gore jr and richard gephardt campaigned in the 
glow of popular noncandidates monday gore with mario cuomo and 
gephardt with lee iacocca but came away without endorsements 
republican george bush touted his endorsement by new jersey gov 
thomas h kean 
bush meanwhile gave out another kind of endorsement lending 
his support to president reagans veto of a major civil rights 
bill congress was poised to override the veto on tuesday 
the legislation is imperfect and the imperfections should 
be corrected he told a group of black supporters in washington 
im not going to start doing now what i havent been doing for 
seven years finding differences with the president for whom i 
have great respect 
bush said however that he supported the idea that the federal 
government should require that organizations that get tax dollars 
comply with civil rights laws 
officials in puerto rico meanwhile continued to tally the 
results of sundays primaries in which bush rolled up another 
victory over bob dole and jesse jackson and michael dukakis added 
to their democratic totals 
while bush attended a new jersey rally with kean republican 
rival dole said in wisconsin that that was the state where he was 
trying to get back in the race 
democratic candidates were focusing on michigan where 
saturdays caucuses are the next big event after weekend contests 
in kansas texas and puerto rico that helped dukakis and jackson 
gephardt and gore won kind words but no endorsement in meetings 
with chrysler corp chairman iacocca and new york gov cuomo 
cuomo the most prominent democratic noncandidate described 
his meeting with gore as excellent and interesting but 
then said senator gore said nothing that i havent heard him say 
before 
the endorsements dont mean a great deal the truth is i 
didnt even need to see al gore said cuomo its nice of him 
to come by 
cuomo called the democratic field a confused picture and 
said he was now accelerating the process of trying to determine 
how best to be useful to the democratic party 
gephardt appeared with iacocca who also has been mentioned at 
times as a possible presidential candidate outside the chrysler 
corp headquarters in highland park mich as gephardt tried to 
revive his flagging candidacy by stressing his tough trade policies 
in the autoproducing state 
iacocca said dick gephardts a good friend of mine and he 
knows what hes talking about on trade but he made no 
endorsement and said he also was looking forward to meeting with 
other presidential candidates 
beyond michigan wisconsins primary 10 days later was shaping 
up as a further democratic battleground two weeks before the big 
new york primary april 19 
gore began running television ads in wisconsin in hopes of 
making it the state where he demonstrates appeal outside the south 
sen paul simon who won in his home state last week was making a 
minimal effort in michigan but intended to run ads in wisconsin 
connecticut holds its primary one week earlier march 29 and 
dukakis was considered the leader although gore would like to 
demonstrate some strength in the massachusetts governors backyard 
jackson campaigned in colorado where caucuses are april 4 and 
in michigan on monday 
republican dole also looking to wisconsin talked with farmers 
in the northwest part of the state and renewed his call for bush to 
debate him 
earlier in green bay dole accused the reagan administration of 
not doing a good job of making its case for aid to the contras who 
are battling nicaraguas sandinista regime 
if you took a poll in wisconsin i think a majority would be 
opposed to contra aid he said but if you asked the same 
people if they think the soviets should have a base in this 
hemisphere they would say no by a wide margin 
keans endorsement came as bush added to a seemingly 
insurmountable lead in delegates 
bush picked up the 14 delegates at stake in puerto ricos 
primary sunday boosting his total to 788 thats nearly 70 percent 
of the 1139 he needs to win at the national convention in new 
orleans this summer dole had 178 former television evangelist pat 
robertson had 17 
bush won in puerto rico with an overwhelming 98 percent of the 
vote in a primary system that in both parties was caught up in 
local disputes and issues such as the divisive question of 
statehood for the us territory 
the 51 democratic delegates from puerto rico all ran as 
uncommitted and the candidates promised major efforts to woo them 
in coming weeks 
jackson won the nonbinding preference poll among puerto rico 
democrats dukakis ran second and simon third 
dukakis won the kansas caucuses on saturday picking up 16 
delegates but jackson ran a strong second and won 14 delegates 
in texas jackson appeared to do better splitting the delegates 
there in county conventions that were the next step in allocating 
atlarge delegates for the state that gave jackson a onedelegate 
edge over dukakis in the texas national delegate count including 
both the primary and caucus results but more complete returns 
could change that 
in total delegates dukakis clung to a small lead over jackson 
the figures were dukakis 5265 jackson 50855 gore 3628 simon 
1715 and gephardt 154 to nominate 2082 delegates are needed 
there are 138 delegates to be decided in michigans caucuses a 
weekend poll by the detroit news had dukakis with 33 percent and 
jackson 30 percent a virtual tie gephardt was far behind in 
third place

nicaragua withdrew its soldiers 
from the honduran border monday and declared an end to fighting 
while it holds truce talks with contra rebels according to reports 
from all sides 
both nicaragua and the contras proposed ceasefires in talks 
monday 
the border region remained tense with honduran patrols on the 
lookout for any booby traps left behind by the sandinistas 
president jose azcona hoyo said the 3200 us troops sent to 
honduras last week after the nicaraguan army was accused of 
sending 2000 men across the border in pursuit of contras may not 
be needed any longer 
the worst is over and there is peace now in the border 
region col reynald andino flores commander of the honduran 
armys 101st infantry brigade said by telephone from his 
headquarters in southern honduras 
we are remaining on a state of alert to be ready for anything 
that may happen he added and soldiers are constantly 
patrolling the area 
flores and other officers some of whom insisted on anonymity 
for security reasons said the sandinistas penetrated an area of 
about 20 square miles inside olancho province while chasing the 
ussupported rebels in a twoweek offensive to evict the contras 
from nicaragua 
about 200 border incidents have been reported in olancho since 
the contras began fighting the leftist sandinista government in 
1981 
president daniel ortega and the nicaraguan government have 
denied sandinista soldiers crossed the border 
the contras maintain camps in an area called bocay which 
includes territory on both sides of the border nicaragua claims 
the camps which the contras use to store supplies and to stage 
raids inside nicaragua are in nicaraguan land but the rebels say 
they are in honduras 
at nicaraguas request a un factfinding team will leave for 
nicaragua tuesday to investigate the border violence the united 
nations announced in a statement it said observations will be 
limited to the nicaragua side since no permission was received 
from honduras to go there 
at sapoa a town on the costa rican border representatives of 
the sandinista government and contras held their first direct talks 
monday on nicaraguan soil 
at the conclusion of the first day of talks both sides said 
they presented ceasefire proposals and agreed to stop fighting 
through the threeday negotiations 
neither side seeks a military victory over the other said 
alfredo cesar head of the rebel delegation 
cesar told reporters the contras proposed a 30day ceasefire 
continuous talks to reach a truce a total amnesty and guarantees 
of free expression to lead toward reconciliation he called the 
talks which were behind closed doors a step ahead 
defense minister humberto ortega leader of the government 
delegation said he proposed an immediate and definitive 
ceasefire he did not elaborate 
sending four battalions of the 82nd airborne division and 7th 
light infantry to honduras brought the us military presence in 
honduras to more than 6000 men they are engaged in joint 
exercises with the hondurans but away from the border combat area 
us and honduran units have held joint exercises every few 
months for the last five years 
some of the american troops practiced military maneuvers at an 
airstrip only 20 miles from the nicaraguan border on sunday a us 
army transport helicopter crashed during an exercise farther from 
the border injuring all 10 us soldiers aboard pentagon 
spokesmen said in washington 
the uh1 huey helicopter crashed monday afternoon near 
juticalpa honduras said maj gary hovatter spokesman for the 
american forces sent to honduras last week 
last thursday and saturday honduran jets bombed sandinista 
positions in the bocay region 145 miles east of tegucigalpa one 
honduran officer said the planes were sent because the nicaraguans 
were not moving out fast enough 
he said the honduran military had strengthened patrols along the 
illdefined 500mile frontier with nicaragua and honduran jets were 
conducting daily observation flights 
azcona said sunday that if there are no more incidents the 
americans will leave on monday he told the associated press 
honduras does not desire war but our armed forces are remaining 
on a state of alert and conducting at least two air reconnaissance 
flights daily 
when the soldiers were sent to honduras last week us 
officials said they would be here about 10 days 
a honduran military source said monday there were very few 
nicaraguan soldiers in our territory our air reconnaissance 
carried out this morning showed it 
in washington the focus turned to a renewed debate over us 
aid to the contras the reagan administration indicated support for 
a new 48 million proposal advanced by a bipartisan group of 
senators 
it would include funds to pay for delivery of up to 25 million 
in previously authorized military aid

shipping executives said iranian gunboats 
attacked a norwegianoperated tanker in the persian gulf early 
tuesday three days after an iraqi attack on a norwegian ship left 
54 seamen missing and presumed dead 
three rockets hit the the 380534ton havglint a liquified 
pertroleum gas carrier that was carrying ammonia from saudi arabia 
a shipping source said on condition of anonymity the ship flies 
the singapore flag but is operated by the oslobased company 
havtor shipping executives said 
at least one person was injured in the latest attack 12 miles 
northwest of dubai said the executives speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the executives said the havglint was leaking chemicals that 
could pose be a pollution problem 
it was the seventh shipping attack since friday when iran in 
apparent reprisal for the resumption of iraqi strikes against its 
oil lifeline ended a fiveweek hiatus in assaults on commercial 
shipping in the gulf 
on monday iran attacked and set ablaze a spanish freighter and 
a liberian tanker 
there was no word on casualties aboard the 10168ton spanish 
refrigerator ship iberian reefer which was burning fiercely at 
dusk hours after it was attacked in the strait of hormuz maritime 
salvage experts said 
salvage tugboats went to the scene there was no word on 
casualties 
earlier shipping executives said at least one iranian gunboat 
fired rocketpropelled grenades at the 61762ton 
liberianregistered fumi setting its engine room ablaze and 
blasting holes in one of its tanks 
the japanesemanaged tanker carrying saudi arabian oil was on 
its way out of the gulf shipping executives said salvage tugboats 
helped the fumis crew extinguish the blaze 
spain called the attack on the iberian reefer an act of 
aggression and summoned teherans ambassador to spain to the 
foreign ministry for an explanation 
the maritime insurance firm lloyds of london said 37 ships 
have been damaged in attacks by iraq and iran this year more than 
twice as many as in the first 2 months of 1987 which was the 
worst year for shipping since the gulf war began in 1980 the 
figure did not include the attack on the havglint 
a norwegian foreign ministry spokesman told the associated press 
that 54 crewmen were presumed dead after iraqi jets bombed two 
iranian tankers at the kharg island oil terminal in the northern 
gulf on saturday 
most of the crew were iranians or asians although a swedish 
officer was among the missing 
if the norwegian report is correct it would be the highest 
casualty toll in any attack by either side in the 4yearold 
tanker war 
christen puntervold spokesman for the norwegian shipping 
association in oslo said only four of 29 crewmen aboard the 
253837ton sanandaj were known to have survived and all 29 aboard 
the second tanker the 316379ton avaj were missing 
both ships are owned by the irans national iranian tanker co 
a senior official of the bahrain government suggested it was 
time for a joint declaration that no interference with shipping 
was tolerable 
information minister tariq almoayyed told nbc news that foreign 
forces should reach a declaration that they will not allow 
interference with freedom of shipping in the gulf 
the iraqi attacks are aimed at disrupting irans oil exports 
through which it finances the war and forcing tehran to accept a 
peace proposal put forth by the united nations 
iraq meanwhile fired a longrange missile into tehran on 
monday in the 105th such attack in three weeks iran said 14 
civilians including two young girls were killed in the explosion 
the missile attack followed an unabated 24hour artillery and 
rocket barrage on basra iraqs secondlargest city and its only 
outlet to the gulf 
the official iraqi news agency also monitored in nicosia 
reported heavy casualties in basra 
both sides have fired nearly 250 missiles into each others main 
cities and border towns since feb 29 reportedly killing hundreds 
of civilians 
iran said that scores of kurdish children aged two to 10 were 
being treated in tehran hospitals for injuries they sustained when 
iraqi troops dropped outlawed chemical bombs in a border region 
last week 
iran had said 5000 kurds were killed and 4000 wounded when 
iraqi planes dropped chemical bombs on the town of halabja and 
adjacent villages after their capture in a land offensive

authorities are investigating whether a 
former federal prosecutor manufactured threats against herself and 
a magistrate during the extradition case of two sikhs accused of 
terrorism in india the us attorney said monday 
a search of former prosecutor judy russells house revealed 
similar threatening messages in a travel bag said us attorney 
samuel a alito jr 
an fbi laboratory analysis concluded that typewritten characters 
on envelopes containing the threats matched those on the 
prosecutors 1983 application to the us attorneys office alito 
said the typewriter matching the print also was found in her 
house he said 
ms russell was in charge of handling the sikhs case as an 
assistant us attorney until leaving the office last summer to 
enter private practice she received a temporary appointment as a 
special assistant after that so she could continue to handle the 
case 
she had submitted sealed information to us magistrate ronald 
j hedges during the weeklong hearing about the extradition in 
february alito revealed monday that they consisted of three 
typewritten envelopes containing the messages and one handwritten 
envelope all purportedly mailed to her newark law office 
one of the letters addressed to ms russell said dont get 
dead dont go to court hedges also received a threatening 
letter two weeks before the extradition hearing alito said 
the revelations that ms russell was under investigation came 
during a court session requested by alito to correct and 
supplement the record regarding the threats 
robert j fettweis ms russells attorney and former colleague 
in the us attorneys office said she was in a private hospital 
he would not comment on any aspect of the case or the nature of her 
illness 
alito said ms russell had not been charged the justice 
departments department of public integrity was handling the 
investigation he said 
the extradition hearings took place feb 15 under extraordinary 
security including sharpshooters on rooftops which federal 
officials said was prompted by intelligence received by 
investigators 
hedges ordered that the men ranjit singh gill 25 and 
sukhminder singh 26 could be extradited that ruling was being 
appealed 
alito said the revelation about ms russells alleged 
involvement in the threats had no affect on the outcome of the 
extradition case but said he would seek a new hearing only 
because we want to avoid any appearance of impropriety 
the indian government charges that singh plotted the revenge 
assassination of a retired general who led the bloody 1984 assault 
against sikh militants occupying the sikhs holiest shrine the 
golden temple in amritsar 
gill was charged in the killing of a parliament member 
singhs attorney ronald kuby called the affair clearly the 
most astounding thing ive heard he has accused the indian 
government of being behind the threats to poison the atmosphere 
against the two sikhs

test tube signaling a possible new route for fighting some tumors 
a scientist said monday 
the poison so strong that a dose the size of a salt grain can 
kill a person may be harnessed for fighting breast cancers that 
have spread elsewhere in the body and some lung and brain tumors 
said ira pastan of the national cancer institute 
the strategy takes advantage of the fact that some cancer cells

a dozen french archaeologists are racing 
against a swarm of bulldozers in this coastal village trying to 
save precious history before it is churned to pieces by 
construction of the tunnel under the english channel 
in reality the race already is lost according to the building 
schedule only six months remain for the historians to save what 
they can from sites containing vestiges of paleolithic neolithic 
bronze age iron age galloroman merovingian and medieval 
cultures 
sites that normally would take years to excavate are being dug 
and studied in two months the meticulous preparation through 
library and archives research is being put off until later the 
focus is entirely on the ground soon to be churned and destroyed 
we know what we cant do said jeanclaude routier chief of 
one crew working at a site on a chalk hill containing the remains 
of an 11th century church and an earlier burial ground we 
select we are starting to get used to the pressure 
a colleague jeanpierre jorrand uncovering a nearby 
galloroman site said we stress recovering knowledge over 
artifacts 
president francois mitterrand of france and prime minister 
margaret thatcher of britain signed an accord in january 1986 for 
the construction of a rail tunnel for trains to carry freight 
motor vehicles and passengers in both directions it is scheduled 
for completion by 1993 at an estimated cost of about 8 billion 
making it the largest privately financed building project ever 
attempted 
though completion is still five years away by september the 
earthmovers will have torn into the entire 2200acre area that 
will be the train terminal on the french side 
the 442000 budget for the archaeological excavations is 
provided jointly by the french culture ministry the anglofrench 
eurotunnel building consortium the staterun french railroad and 
local and regional governments 
its difficult for an archaeologist to work so fast says 
luc vallin conservator of antiquities and prehistory in the 
nordpas de calais region of northern france as well as field 
director here its really rescue archaeology 
the historians started working on an archaeological report in 
the autumn of 1985 before the tunnel accord was signed the report 
was completed in march 1986 but archaeological work was delayed 
while a financing agreement was worked out 
prospecting for potential digging sites began with money 
advanced by eurotunnel in september 1986 even before the budget 
agreement was reached aerial surveys were made mechanical shovels 
dug swaths across the ground in areas of potential archaeological 
value 
twenty sites were selected 
some excavation began in june 1987 but work really didnt get 
moving strongly until december 
at one site if we could have excavated it completely we 
could have reconstructed entire gaullish houses said vallin 
as it was we had to content ourselves with what could be saved 
archaeologists know very little about the galloroman era in 
this region roughly from boulogne to the belgian border rural 
life in the medieval period also is a subject of great interest 
perhaps its in the medieval period that we are finding the 
most exciting material and in protohistory the bronze and iron 
ages vallin said 
the biggest problem apart from time is personnel 
at some sites we could have used 20 people for a year instead 
of three for two months vallin said 
relations with the tunnel builders have been fairly good even 
if they sometimes push a little hard the archaeologists and the 
construction men meet once a week to discuss schedules 
the vast range of history covered by the digs requires a wide 
range of talent most of the archaeologists are contract workers 
hired for a limited time usually according to their speciality 
from an educational point of view i am a prehistorian 
vallin said but i have learned a lot about the roman and 
medieval periods 
sitting on the chalk hill surveying the remains of a medieval 
church and nearby structures crew chief routier was preparing to 
move on after 2 months at the site 
it would be interesting to dig up all the graves to study the 
methods of the period he said its all going to disappear 
with the bulldozers 
even so vallin and the others said without the tunnel project 
its likely the sites would not have been tapped at all because of 
lack of funding

it is the very picture of adventure the 
climber planting a flag in triumph atop an icy himalayan peak what 
isnt generally known however is that a mountain of paperwork has 
to be scaled first 
mountain climbing in nepal for all its risk and romance also 
means conquering an array of permits payments insurance forms 
and wills for sherpa guides and then comes patience for it can 
take years to get it all done 
anyone who wants to climb the famed mount everest for example 
may have to wait six or seven years to get a nepalese government 
permit because the worlds highest peak also is nepals most 
desired challenge then there are the expenses and 58 pages of 
rules set down by nepals government 
probably 80 percent of the effort is getting to the bottom of 
the mountain to start the climb says steve langley a canadian 
leading a sixweek expedition up 22479foot mount ama dablam 10 
miles southwest of everest 
langley a 40yearold computer consultant from calgary 
alberta first applied to climb the mountain in 1982 
we arrived here without the permit he said it was 
finally granted officially three weeks ago 
murari p khatiwada of nepals mountaineering division says the 
long wait is due to the growing number of people who want to ascend 
122 of the 1310 peaks nepal grants permits for 
ten years ago we had 20 expeditions throughout the year now 
we have more than 100 said khatiwada 
he explained that amounted to 800 to 1000 climbers not 
including the guides and porters usually from the nimble sherpa 
tribe who accompany foreign mountaineers 
for this reason khatiwada said nearly all nepals mountains 
are booked through 1990 and applications for some peaks are being 
accepted for the year 2000 
he said it was vital to limit the number of climbers to protect 
nepals environment 
a mountain is fragile he explained it cannot bear the 
burden of too many people 
just as frustrating as the wait for climbers are the government 
regulations which get down to such details as how many socks 
shoes and umbrellas must be supplied to guides and porters they 
also list fees for the peaks all that is just the beginning of an 
expeditions expenses 
the permit to climb everests 29028 feet costs 2547 for any 
other peak above 26400 feet the fee is 2038 for mount ama 
dablam it costs 1528 
langleys team of himself four other canadians and an american 
has budgeted 24000 for the climb and he said were doing it on 
the cheap 
all his people are experienced and already have most of the 
needed equipment the american climber tom dickey 31 of boulder 
colo has worked as a trekking guide in nepal 
but the team is taking along a liaison officer required by the 
government but paid by the expedition a chief sherpa an 
assistant and 12 porters salaries for all are specified in the 
government rules along with the equipment to be provided them 
langley said the actual gear is rarely given the sherpas most 
of whom have equipment from earlier climbs and a cash payment is 
usually negotiated in lieu of equipment 
the daily salary in the scheme of things is peanuts said 
langley 
he said the pay to the government liaison officer for example 
is 2 a day his equipment allowance comes to the equivalent of 
800 
other expenses include 1000 for an agency to help ease the way 
through the nepalese bureaucracy 350 for required insurance for 
climbers and sherpas and the cost of getting climbers and their 
equipment to nepal 
each man on langleys team is putting up 4000 to make the 
climb although expeditions often seek funds from mountaineering 
societies philanthropists or companies wanting publicity for their 
products 
peter hill an englishman also leading an expedition up ama 
dablam said he wrote 400 letters seeking backing without success 
to get money these days for a peak its got to be unclimbed 
or its got to be everest he complained 
but hill 26 ran into a stroke of luck his father happened 
upon a newspaper ad for a bank perpetual unit trust picturing its 
symbol the peak of ama dablam 
dickey the colorado climber noted that mountaineers can avoid 
all the preliminary trouble by climbing europes alps or the andes 
in south america where no permits are needed 
nevertheless he said im in on an everest expedition in 
1990

although communist rebels 
threaten to attack us businesses in the philippines one american 
company is growing pineapples on a substantial chunk of mindanao 
island and showing little fear in doing it 
its a very open company and a very open society said brian 
carew field operations manager of the philippine packing corp 
local subsidiary of rjr reynolds which now owns the del monte 
brand of products i feel safer here than in new york 
communist rebels who operate near this giant plantation some 
500 miles southeast of manila have threatened to attack american 
interests in retaliation for us support of philippines 
governments that have been fighting the insurgents for 19 years 
this past november the rival dolephilippines inc considered 
abandoning its fruit plantation in mindanaos south cotabato 
province after raids by communist rebels resulted in more than 
250000 worth of property and equipment damage 
the del monte plantation in bukidnon province has no fencing 
and only a small security force 
in december communist new peoples army guerrillas raided a 
military camp in the bukidnon town of don carlos and made off with 
a machine gun more than 20 automatic assault rifles grenades and 
thousands of rounds of ammunition 
carew a native of dorchester mass said communist bands 
occasionally pass through the western side of the plantation but 
have not attacked he said del monte does not pay the rebels 
protection money 
since del monte began operations in the philippines in 1926 its 
holdings have grown from about 9880 acres to more than 61750 
acres around the towns of impasugong sumilao libona and manolo 
fortich 
onethird of the land is leased from the governments national 
development corp for about 16 an acre a year the rest is leased 
from local farmers 
company officials said in interviews with the associated press 
that del monte employs about 10600 workers including about 100 at 
company headquarters in manila most workers come from bukidnon and 
neighboring misamis oriental province 
the subsidiary had gross sales of 110 million last year and net 
income of 207 million it earned 788 million in hard currency 
for the philippines and paid the philippines peso equivalent of 21 
million in taxes 
company officials estimate that about 60000 people in the area 
depend on the plantation 
at camp philipps the largest of the subsidiarys seven camps 
workerss quarters are simple but adequate a large social hall 
dominates the main road next to a cooperative store where workers 
buy most of their daily needs 
speak english signs are posted on the walls of the camps 
vocational school for boys 
children of management officials including carews 12yearold 
daughter jessica attend the del monte school up to seventh grade 
the school teaches 20 to 25 children about threefourths of them 
filipino 
private secondary schools and colleges are subsidized by the 
comany and tuition fees are comparatively low 
officials said the average daily salary is 105 pesos 525 
nearly double the mandated minimum wage medical treatment is free 
housing including electricity and water is free for some 2000 
senior employees while others get housing allowances 
brian haycox the philippines company president said del monte 
believes in above average worker benefits because we cant run 
our business manage it and address all the issues facing us today 
unless we have good human resource development 
the company does not allow visiting journalists to interview 
workers unless accompanied by an official 
i dont apologize to anybody about what we do because we do it 
well carew told a group of visiting reporters 
the company came in for criticism this past october in report by 
a swiss mission that visited in february 1987 the mission made up 
of the migros cooperative society swiss aid helbetas swiss 
lenten fund and bread for brethren said many workers complained of 
harassment and intimidation by lower and middlegrade supervisors 
and of unjustified promotions 
the overriding feeling is one of fear of losing the job the 
report said mistrust of the company is widespread 
it added that workers showed little confidence in their 
unions the associated labor union and the workers alliance of 
trade unions which it said are perceived as promanagement 
but worker activity against the company has been limited 
some workers have been picketing the companys cannery in nearby 
gugo and a company bus was set afire early this year 
the swiss mission report also criticized the companys policy of 
leasing land from local farmers charging the leases are couched in 
language the farmers cant understand 
adrian pabayo the companys public relations manager defended 
the policy 
there is enough land available here not being used he said

three years after he was swept to office 
in a landslide prime minister rajiv gandhi has become the target 
of a vociferous opposition campaign for his ouster 
antigovernment rallies have been drawing thousands of 
sloganshouting demonstrators to new delhi parliament has been 
disrupted by angry walkouts general strikes have closed 
businesses and schools 
we think he is vulnerable said prakash karat of the marxist 
communist party of india which has helped organize some of the 
agitation if he dares to call a midterm poll snap election 
the opposition has a good chance of winning 
in karats eyes the 43yearold prime minister has brought the 
problems on himself he cited charges of corruption rising sikh 
separatist violence in punjab state and mounting economic problems 
gandhi has so far rejected calls for a snap election and aides 
and some independent analysts say the opposition parties are too 
much in disarray to beat him anyway 
the handful of factions are united only in their antigandhi 
fervor and often tend to compete more with each other no overall 
leader has emerged from among the dissidents 
the indian press alive to rumors that gandhi may indeed call an 
election has begun talking about his tina factor an acronym 
for there is no alternative supporters and detractors alike 
say tina may ensure that gandhi not only weathers the political 
storm but emerges with a second fiveyear term 
a poll of more than 10000 voters conducted in february for 
india today a biweekly news magazine indicated that if parliament 
elections were held now gandhis congress party would win 64 
percent of the seats 
that would be down from the 77 percent congress won in december 
1984 when gandhi came to power on a wave of sympathy two months 
after his mother and predecessor indira gandhi was assassinated 
by two sikh bodyguards but its more than enough to form a 
government in indias multiparty system 
rajiv gandhis congress benefits from the tina factor 
precisely because the opposition parties show no signs of coming 
together india today concluded 
ashis nandy a political analyst at the center for the study of 
developing societies doesnt agree regardless of what opinion 
polls show he said the opposition could defeat gandhi 
the indian electorate traditionally either rewards a regime 
for ruling well or punishes it for ruling badly nandy added 
although rajiv gandhi may still be personally honest he looks 
tainted looks inefficient the voters do not feel good about him 
just who would lead an opposition charge nationally remains in 
question the strongest contender is vp singh who was gandhis 
finance minister and then defense minister before being ousted from 
the congress party on grounds of antiparty activity 
singh now assails gandhi as a total failure he and a dozen 
other congress dissidents have been trying to forge alliances with 
other opposition groups no common front has emerged in part 
because leftist groups like the communist party refuse to ally 
themselves with rightwing hindudominated parties like the 
bharatiya janata party 
gandhi enjoyed a honeymoon of sorts during his first two years 
in office an airline pilot before moving into politics he 
promised to modernize india and was nicknamed mr clean for his 
pledge to bring honest government to the 800 million indians 
with the congressdominated parliament behind him gandhi 
liberalized industrial policy modified the tax system to encourage 
private investment and increased funding for education and health 
last year the honeymoon ended first came the disclosure that 
gandhis finance ministry had hired an american detective agency to 
investigate the illegal overseas bank accounts of indians a 
controversial move in a nation wary of foreign influence 
next came the announcement that the government was investigating 
alleged kickbacks paid on contracts for swedish artillery and west 
german submarines 
opposition leaders and several powerful newspapers seized the 
corruption issue and hammered away with allegations that some of 
the bribes went to gandhi or his allies in the congress party 
none of the charges were proved but gandhi was forced to go to 
parliament and deny personal involvement 
at the same time domestic problems mounted 
the annual monsoon rains failed plunging twothirds of the 
nation into drought 
attacks by sikh extremists in punjab rose dramatically leaving 
more than 1000 people dead by the end of 1987 
an indiansponsored peace accord in nearby sri lanka was signed 
but shortly collapsed although gandhi has sent more than 50000 
troops to the island to put down a tamil separatist rebellion the 
opposition has not focused on the issue 
last year there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty said 
a gandhi aide who spoke on condition of anonymity we weathered 
it since then a lot of high temperatures have come down

police have restored order in tibetan streets 
following the second bloody proindependence protest in five 
months but chinas policy toward the rugged area remains in 
disorder with signs of backstage wrangling 
on the one side are officials who argue for leniency noting 
that the chinese earned the hatred of tibetans during the 1960s and 
1970s by virtually outlawing buddhism the center of most tibetans 
lives 
the panchen lama the highestranking tibetan religious leader 
in china is among these an official news report after a protest 
march 5 quoted him as saying china must further improve regional 
autonomy and heal the wounds caused by the ultraleftist line 
he promised even more lenient and flexible policies from 
beijing whose rule he supports 
on the other side are those who believe beijings relative 
leniency since 1980 is to blame for the unrest and that only a 
tough crackdown will ensure it is not repeated 
it is necessary to exercise dictatorship over such 
separatists the director of united fronts tibet department 
zheng ying was quoted as saying the united front is an 
organization that seeks to coordinate relations between the 
governing communist party and other parties which are few 
other reports have quoted unidentified officials as declaring 
that the government has exercised too much restraint 
so far neither side appears to have won out sketchy reports 
from foreign travelers to tibets capital lhasa indicate 
widespread arrests but the monasteries do not appear to be under 
direct police control as they were after demonstratons last year 
no foreign journalists have been allowed in lhasa since march 5 
piecing together official accounts and those of foreign 
witnesses this picture emerges of what happened that day 
hundreds of monks had gathered outside the 1300yearold 
jokhang temple in tibets capital lhasa for the conclusion of a 
10day prayer festival one monk stood up suddenly and called for 
tibetan independence 
as police dragged him away other monks took up the chant and 
stoned the officers more than 12 hours of violence followed 
during which thousands of tibetans stoned police from behind 
makeshift barricades and burned chinese restaurants police set off 
tear gas and stormed the jokhang 
according to official accounts one policeman was killed and 
more than 30 hospitalized western travelers in lhasa said tibetans 
reported 21 tibetans and three policemen killed 
in its duration and scope the protest appeared much larger than 
the attack by thousands of tibetans oct 1 on a police station in 
lhasa foreign witnesses reported at least 14 people killed then 
the new violence makes it clear the violence oct 1 was not an 
isolated incident the result of momentarily high emotions but 
rather an expression of tibetan determination to shake off 37 years 
of chinese communist rule 
it thus makes more difficult beijings task of charting a policy 
most likely to keep the peace 
those who favor conciliation and greater autonomy and 
development aid for tibetans hope to gain time for a gradual 
cultural assimilation under the gentle pressure of chinese schools 
television and other influences 
but those opposed to liberal policies argue that relaxation has 
fostered rebellion by allowing tibets buddhist monasteries to 
reopen and enroll new candidates 
the monasteries have become hotbeds of religiousinspired 
nationalism with most monks praying for the return of the dalai 
lama tibets former temporal and spiritual leader now in exile in 
india 
the dalai lama regarded as a reincarnation of tibets protector 
god fled in 1959 during a failed uprising against chinese rule 
the dalai lama is central to tibetan buddhism which in turn is 
central to tibetans cultural identity 
the clashes oct 1 and march 5 began when monks shouted 
independence slogans and the youngest monks generally led the 
violence 
a harsh crackdown on the monasteries might crush this source of 
nationalism or encourage more martyrdom 
it also could trigger concern in chinas other minority areas 
about the depth of beijings commitment to their own local 
autonomy most of chinas strategic border regions are populated by 
minorities 
notable in the aftermath of the protest was the lack of any 
significant us response after the oct 1 clash the us senate 
adopted a resolution urging greater respect for human rights in 
tibet the resolution prompted angry protests from china of what it 
called interference in its internal affairs 
this time foreign minister wu xueqian of china was in the 
united states but us officials did not mention tibet in public 
us secretary of state george p shultz raised the issue in 
private talks with wu but it was not allowed to disturb the visits 
overall atmosphere of friendliness instead the reagan 
administration lifted a freeze on expanding sales of 
hightechnology goods to china the freeze was imposed last year to 
protest chinese missile sales to iran

chinas liberal policies in tibet created the conditions that 
sparked bloody riots in lhasa in october and early march according 
to american tibet scholars and us officials 
in an ironic twist the observers say beijings attempts to 
improve the lot of the tibetan people have caused a crisis of 
higher expectations prompting tibetans to seek faster change from 
a recalcitrant beijing 
these observers predict that rioting in the provinces capital 
lhasa on march 5 will prompt an ironfisted crackdown and the 
return of hardline chinese rule to the roof of the world 
such a crackdown will postpone again any possibility of 
resolving chinas main minority problem ensuring renewed suffering 
for tibetans 
tibetans are grabbing for a mile when the chinese are offering 
them an inch said a state department official speaking on 
condition of anonymity we see little possibility for 
resolution 
after the disturbances march 5 a military response is the 
only way said tom grunfeld a tibetan expert and professor at 
the state university of new yorks empire state college in 
manhattan its part of the sad equation in tibet 
china has claimed sovereignty over the himalayan region since 
the 13th century but many tibetans view the chinese as an 
occupying force and yearn for independence 
in 1950 the chinese red army entered tibet and beijing promised 
tibetan leaders a measure of autonomy it failed to deliver 
nine years later tibetans rebelled the chinese army cracked 
down and the dalai lama tibets temporal and spiritual leader 
fled to india 
in 1966 conditions further deteriorated with the onset of 
chinas ultraleftist cultural revolution 
atheist chinese red guards charging that tibet was backward and 
feudalistic attempted to destroy its buddhist culture of tibets 
3000 temples only a handful survived thousands of monks and 
religious pilgrims were slaughtered 
grunfeld said his interviews with refugees gave no indications 
of sustained unrest among the tibetan people from 1959 to 1976 
the chinese clamped a very tight lid on tibet any protest was 
crushed immediately 
conditions in tibet began to improve after the end of the 
cultural revolution with the death of chairman mao tsetung in 1976 
hu yaobang the former communist party boss went to lhasa and 
issued a public apology for the excesses of the cultural revolution 
for the first time since 1959 tibetans were allowed to travel 
from one county to the next without government permission 
hospitals were built the tibetan language was allowed back in 
the schools and taxes were cut or eliminated china opened its 
border with nepal allowing renewed contact with the tibetan exile 
community 
with an eye to a profitable tourist trade the chinese also 
began repairing some of the monasteries destroyed by the red 
guards a prohibition on buddhist proselytzing was lifted and young 
monks appeared again in the temples 
in 1980 representatives of the dalai lama began negotiations 
with the chinese to set conditions for his return to china 
negotiations broke off two years later because the chinese insisted 
that he live in beijing and he wanted to live in lhasa 
the chinese are pumping millions of dollars into the region 
and there are only 3 million people there grunfeld said 
things are looking up especially in the cities 
emboldened by reforms tibetans staged proindependence 
demonstrations in september and october last year and again march 5 
and 6 
the demonstrations were led by monks tibets traditional 
soldiers who grunfeld said dont fit the western idea of a 
contemplative individual making cheese and wine 
the observers said chinas reforms prompted the riots because 
they allowed tibetans to congregate more freely without fear of 
instant repression the reforms also allowed contact with tibetans 
abroad and by opening tibet to western tourists the chinese 
provided the monks with an international stage for their protests 
the success of the reforms also played a hand 
the reforms have created among some tibetan refugees a sense 
of desperation said the state department official its like 
they said weve got to act now or well never be able to do it 
again 
many tibetans claim the reforms are insidious aimed at turning 
tibet into a living museum to boost chinas tourism industry 
they also claim their land is being overrun by hordes of 
chinese sent in from beijing to sinicize the remote region 
grunfeld says the truth of that allegation depends on how one 
defines tibet 
tibets current boundaries correspond to its traditional 
political influence but tibetan activists define tibet as the area 
of its traditional cultural influence which includes large tracts 
of qinghai sichuan and yunnan provinces 
grunfeld said thousands of chinese settlers are moving to those 
three provinces but few are going to tibet 
but he added that the region cannot lure enough competent 
chinese officials to manage it 
its a dumping ground for incompetents the chinese cant get 
anyone to go there

seeking to take office in bolton courts and judges intervened 
federal pollwatchers came to town and death threats were made 
before it all came about 
hundreds of other communities in all corners of the united 
states have made whitetoblack political transitions in the 20 
years since kings assassination some of the biggest change has 
come in the south home to more than half of the us black 
population 
blacks are running towns they marched through in the 60s 
fighting for the right to vote the number of southern black 
elected officials has increased by 55 times since 1965 williams 
said 
mississippi where civil rights leader medgar evers was slain in 
front of his house where riots erupted when james meredith tried 
to enter college and the late gov ross barnett surrounded by a 
cadre of state troopers turned him away has 548 black elected 
officials tops in the nation 
mississippi has changed in many ways bolton is part of the 
metamorphosis 
the no 1 progress is getting rid of the fear said butler 
who picked cotton as a child and once picketed a whitesonly pool 
with a sign that urged dont blow your cool let us in the 
pool 
used to be you had a fear of somebody coming up to you and 
accusing you of anything he said you might have a 
confrontation with a white and there was no such thing as winning 
butler never doubted blacks could manage bolton he just didnt 
think it would happen 
i figured whites would have died before they let us have the 
right to vote he said some did and blacks did too 
black officeholders here he said have given folks a certain 
sense of pride and understanding blacks know theres somebody here 
on a daytoday basis fighting for them 
still black leadership has not made poor people richer or two 
societies one 
butler estimates blacks annual income in bolton at about 4500 
about a third that of whites he said about 25 percent of blacks 
are jobless 
although blacks and whites live together they attend separate 
churches and social functions and white children attend private 
schools 
i would love to paint you a peachesandcream story said 
bennie thompson the towns first black mayor now a member of the 
hinds county board of supervisors

i want to tell you i stand by my fence and drink coffee with 
my white neighbor i cant tell you that its not reality 
everybody gets along said doug beard the sole white 
council member but i think both feel better with their own 
peers 
in bolton politics brings neither power nor prestige the mayor 
and council are parttime posts there are no big salaries no 
highprofile jobs 
and theres little to lure outsiders particularly with jackson 
16 miles away a cotton gin is virtually the only industry and the 
main drag is a row of crumbling centuryold stores 
still bolton was important enough to cause a lot of kicking and 
screaming when blacks about 60 percent of the population wanted a 
say in government 
it was a long tough fight harder and tougher than any ive 
ever seen in mississippi said parker now at the lawyers 
committee for civil rights under law in washington dc 
the whites perceived their town as their plantation it was 
theirs to run 
the fight began in the late 60s thompson a local college 
graduate who marched in mississippi with king felt blacks had been 
ignored long enough 
it wasnt an attempt to take over he said all we wanted 
to do is help develop the community blacks including thompson 
sought three of five aldermanic seats 
after fights over registration procedures and complaints filed 
with federal authorities the blacks won the losers sued alleging 
voter irregularities the blacks prevailed in appeals court 
but after the mayor repeatedly vetoed the black aldermens 
proposals thompson ran for mayor in 1973 on an allblack slate 
that winning slate also was sued unsuccessfully 
this town has generated more voting litigation than any i know 
of in mississippi to keep blacks from taking office parker said 
that was just the beginning when thompson took office the 
police department quit the county repossessed the garbage truck 
and the lease on the garbage dump was revoked thompson said he 
found that town records were kept on a school notepad water bill 
monies were stored in a lard can and town employees were paid from 
the general store which was then reimbursed 
being black we couldnt afford to operate the system like our 
counterparts he explained because it would make them vulnerable 
to corruption charges the system would have destroyed us what 
kinds of checks and balances do you have putting money in a lard 
can 
to make matters worse bolton lacked the basics fires for 
example were fought with a pickup truck with a loose wheel and a 
pump on the back 
so thompson launched a letterwriting campaign asking 
foundations and cities for help it came a fire truck donated for 
one dollar from new york city a garbage truck from southfield 
mich an ambulance from marshalltown iowa and a planner from the 
national council of churches who developed a town hall fire 
station park and daycare center 
gravel streets in the black neighborhoods were paved sewer and 
water improvements were made a 11 million 40unit subsidized 
housing development was built for lowincome and elderly residents 
in the middle of the white part of town drawing angry opposition 
we have shown that black elected officials can bring a 
community from virtual obscurity into the 20th century from the 
standpoint of municipal services human and social needs said 
thompson who says he has received death threats over the years 
but we also created hope that things can be better there was no 
hope there was nothing 
some disagree while beard concedes some improvements have been 
made the overall appearance of the city is much worse he 
said business is worse because people dont like coming to an 
area that looks deplorable 
thompson stepped down in 1979 to become a board member in the 
county one of the first two blacks butler who moved to bolton 
as a teenager has been mayor since running unopposed in 1985 
parker says whites have basically deserted the political 
process 
beard says they dont seek office for the same reason blacks 
are not runnning in bolton people just dont care to be honest 
thompson says they do and black leadership has changed bolton 
there are young people in our community whove never seen 
anybody in authority except somebody whos black theyre good role 
models he said black elected officials clearly represent a 
new awakening 
we cant run this community like our white predecessors we 
want things to be accessible to everybody

more than four times that of 1970 according to the joint center

black power was to me a black version of ethnic american 
politics said charles hamilton a columbia university political 
science professor and coauthor with carmichael of black power 
the politics of liberation in america 
were talking about no more than what italians have done what 
the irish have done he said before we almost had to 
assimilate in order to achieve i saw that as wrong it denied 
ones heritage 
black power gave birth to a new sense of selfworth 
what the black power movement was all about was youve got to 
shed the negative image morris said thats why you got the 
phrase black is beautiful there was a profound evaluation of 
black people of who they are 
it was a repudiation of the notion blacks had to judge their 
own beauty and importance by white standards he added 
new styles and customs emerged emphasizing black roots 
afroamerican names mushrooming afro hairdos and loosefitting 
boldly patterned dashikis 
one symbol the clenched fist stirred anger and sometimes 
fear at the 1968 mexico city olympics just six months after 
kings assassination sprinters tommie smith and john carlos the 
gold and bronze medal winners in the 200meter dash raised 
blackgloved fists high overhead as the national anthem was played 
for what they termed a display of black unity and protest of black 
poverty the two athletes were suspended by the us olympic 
committee 
the symbols and words of black power shocked many whites even 
some who marched in civil rights demonstrations 
some found it extremely threatening said douglas mcadam 
associate sociology professor at the university of arizona to 
them it smacked of reverse racism no longer equality but 
black power black domination 
mcadam has written a book chronicling how financial 
contributions dropped when groups such as the student nonviolent 
coordinating committee a civil rights organization shifted focus 
from the fight for equality to more incendiary urgings 
the movement also divided blacks king who preached nonviolent 
tactics said the slogan carried the wrong connotations and was 
potentially destructive 
separatism wasnt the answer he argued because blacks and 
whites needed each other there is no salvation for the negro 
through isolation king wrote in his book where do we go from 
here chaos or community 
he thought it was too divisive too difficult to explain 
hamilton said he was right 
other black leaders and groups including the naacp also 
opposed the black power term creating friction as two movements 
competed for center stage 
the civil rights movement was overrun walters said many 
of its leaders would not join black power more fundamentally 
it took away the allegiance of the people 
but academics also note that black leaders eventually supported 
many of the movements goals king in particular embraced the 
psychological need for black power and the importance of black 
economic strength 
after his assassination the movement took new forms as some of 
its causes became mainstream 
once blacks got the vote and began to elect more blacks 
people began to believe they at least had channels said linda 
williams senior political analyst at the joint center for 
political studies 
the black power movement also weakened as radicals were jailed 
and the government cracked down the fbi conducted a secret 
campaign of dirty tricks involving faked panther documents and 
letters informants and infiltrators 
it was surprising to me the movement was destroyed so 
completely said newton panther cofounder newton today 
believes any gains made by the black power movement have been wiped 
out 
black unemployment is very high he said police actions 
are as belligerent as ever overt racism is on the rampage as if 
there never was a movement 
with the hindsight of 20 years some criticize black power as 
merely words without a program others say it left a strong legacy 
academics point to the growth of blackowned businesses 
newspapers and radio stations as well as greater numbers of black 
journalists and literature and arts programs 
others cite the thousands of black officeholders and jesse 
jacksons strong presidential bid black power today is being 
carried out in the electoral arena jennings sai 
universities offer hundreds of black studies programs and 
hamilton credits the movement for the formation of such groups as 
the congressional black caucus 
still the movement has not given all blacks power 
in economics there have been a lot of gains but theyve been 
concentrated in the black middle class said clayborne carson a 
stanford university history professor and editor of the martin 
luther king papers project 
the group left out is the poor he said the irony is 
thats who black power was supposed to help the most

that after spending time in china algeria and north vietnam he 
ended his advocacy of communism and developed an understanding 
and respect for free enterprise and the democratic political 
system 
stokely carmichael a former chairman of the student 
nonviolent coordinating committee whose chant of black power 
became a slogan for a movement is now known as kwame toure and 
travels between guinea and the united states said charles 
hamilton a political science professor at columbia university

whatever became of the indy 8045 and the rest of the metric 
system 
the whole thing went away and died says ray lloyd of the 
scale manufacturers association 
he meant the 1975 act of congress which was to have consigned 
pounds inches rods furlongs picas acres gills gallons miles 
per hour and their myriad cousins to the trash bin for a brave new 
world of metrics officially three bureaucrats a secretary and a 
250000 budget inside the huge department of commerce in 
washington are what remain of that vision of a metric america 
but inch by inch the meter has wedged a foot in the back door of 
the nation 
oh a miss is still as good as a mile lovers still love a 
bushel and a peck not a liter and a stere 
but almost all american cars are built to metric measure booze 
and wine come by the liter skis film pharmaceuticals are in 
millimeters and grams edwin moses runs the 400meter hurdles 
almost all gradeschoolers learn some metrics star wars when 
and if will be metric as the pentagon honorably discharges the 
old measurements inherited from great britain where a yard was the 
distance from henry is nose to the tip of his middle finger 
sixtytwo percent of the fortune 1000 companies make something 
thats metric thirtyfour percent of their new products are in 
five or six years probably all packaged goods on supermarket 
shelves will be labeled gramliters as well as poundounces most 
significantly an omnibus trade bill to be voted on this spring by 
congress contains a provision requiring 42 agencies of the federal 
government to basically go metric by september 30 1993 that 
includes the department of defense the biggest buyer of them all 
in hearings last summer no organized constituency opposed the 
metric portion of the bill 
ask anyone who knows a hand four inches from a hectare will 
america ever be metric the invariable answer inevitably when 
nobody can say congress is charged by the constitution with 
regulating weights and measures congress is congress and old 
habits are old habits 
in the metric conversion act of 1975 congress declared it the 
policy of the united states to coordinate and plan the 
voluntary stress added conversion to the metric system 
this bold pronouncement toothless as a professional hockey 
player was akin to telling the nations 4yearolds eat your 
broccoli because its good for you but you can stick to ice cream 
if you want americans by and large preferred vanilla 
to be or not to be metric is called americas longest debate 
congress almost adopted the meter in 1896 but the nations largest 
trading partner britain and its empire were poundinches the 
united states went along 
inchpounds led and lead the world because of the standards 
and technology that support them says charles wilson director 
of engineering for the industrial fastener institute 
by the 1960s however american industry was expanding overseas 
into a largely metric world in 1969 the united states exported 14 
billion in measuresensitive products and imported only 6 billion 
but by 1975 it was estimated the nation would suffer a 600 million 
loss in foreign business because it was not metric 
in 1971 the national bureau of standards whose official yard 
and pound are based on metric measure completed a threeyear study 
of metrication two years later general motors announced it would 
make metric cars the 1975 act originally set a 10year schedule 
for conversion heavy lobbying particularly by trade unions and 
small businesses struck this out while the act set up a 17member 
metric board it was only empowered to publicize 
encourage consult assist 
how can you do something if its not mandated asks metric 
hardliner louis sokol past president of the private us metric 
association we dont make speed limits or the income tax 
voluntary the metric board just became a debating society 
we missed an opportunity 13 years ago gerald underwood 
concedes his office of metric programs that fourperson 
operation at the commerce department is what survives of the 
metric board that once had 100 employees and a 3 million annual 
budget ronald reagan cut off its funds in 1982 
metrication should have been presented in terms of trade 
instead of conformance says underwood focused on the 
pocketbook instead of the agony of converting the housewifes 
recipe book but i believe in free enterprise rather than 
government dictate 
we felt the enormity of the problem of conversion was 
completely underestimated says bob woods research director for 
the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
machinists and carpenters would have to buy new tools theyd be 
fired for mismeasuring above all foreign metric goods would pour 
in 
of course thats what happened anyway says sokol 
just what metric conversion nationally might cost seems 
impossible to calculate one unattributed estimate was 25 billion 
over 30 years the pentagon has said it would cost the defense 
industry 18 billion threefourths of that in the first 10 years 
the steel industry had a figure of 2 billion in 1973 but said 
actuality was nothing close to the original estimate 
the ford motor company started with a metrication department 
which became a section then a group and then me says george 
baumgartner whose job as metric planner was done away with last 
year the cost was negligible everything is now metric except 
the speedometer and tire rims our biggest problem is how to spell 
liter litre 
gm found the accounting costs for conversion cost more than 
conversion itself says sokol the pharmaceutical industry which 
converted in the 1950s said the cost was lower than expected and 
produced savings through fewer mistakes easier employee training 
and improved records 
small businesses on the other hand dont have the economies of 
scale 
machine tools can cost 2 million says wilson of the 
fastener institute changing dies is very expensive so you want 
to make as many items as you can without having to tear the machine 
up to make another size the us uses 200 billion fasteners a 
year it would cost billions to stock dual sizes 
john deere where underwood was head of standards spent 
onethird the value of its shelf parts on annual inventory part 
of that cost is insurance space heat light standardization 
reduces these costs we used to have about 70 screw sizes 
metrication reduced that to 12 or 15 which meant economies in 
buying in bulk number of bins and errors

for the nation its almost impossible to figure a cost but we 
figure each 1 billion in manufacturing means 30000 jobs anything 
that metrication does to improve our international trade is then 
part of that equation 
to purists the late 1970s were the golden years of 
metrication interstate highway signs announced distances in 
mileskilometers schools blossomed with colorful conversion 
posters shell oil spent 2 million converting 16000 gas stations 
sunrise fla said it would go entirely metric to celebrate the 
bicentennial 
motorists immediately began screaming their heads off says 
the federal highway administration in 1978 congress took the signs 
down shell soon found metric gas pumps confused drivers and 
converted back to gallons when the national geographic society 
started using metrics on maps and stories some 70 readers said the 
magazine had gone pinko and canceled their subscriptions 
metric zealots just kind of gave up and went looking for other 
crusades says valerie antoine executive director of the us 
metric association 
metericians hoped the schools would incubate a metric america 
but when the rest of society didnt keep pace teachers said 
hey we got left out on a limb says leroy negus associate in 
mathematics at the ny state department of education 
california said all its textbooks would be metric by 1985 they 
arent but almost all schools in the country include some metric 
instruction october 10 get it 1010 still kicks off national 
metric week 
the effort is to get children to think metric as well as know 
it to know right off that 28 degrees celsius is hot outside 
without multiplying ninefifths plus 32 to get fahrenheit 
kent ashworth of educational testing service the princeton 
nj organization that gives scholastic aptitude tests says a 
survey of 13yearolds showed those who use metrics often 
outside class more than doubled 16 percent to 34 percent 
between 1978 and 1982 
but in a 1981 test given internationally american students 
finished near the bottom in measurement skills 
children are taught both systems says sokol they are 
knowledgeable in both and proficient in neither 
as a ninthgrader wrote the late commerce secretary malcolm 
baldridge if you ask me its confusing using both systems when 
our nation could choose one please keep this letter in 
consideration and remember all of the confused kids in this 
country 
sokol worries too about adult education why did some 
newspapers convert the 70 and 80meter ski jump results at the 
recent calgary winter olympics to feet why when president reagan 
clunked 14pound congressional bills on the dais in his recent 
state of the union address didnt he call them 62kilogram bills 
what a wasted opportunity bemoans sokol 
the united states stands alone with burma as the only nonmetric 
holdouts in a kilogram world canada said in 1970 it would go 
metric and did its metric commission disbanded in 1985 no 
problems says francois broeur of the ministry of consumer and 
corporate affairs 
he probably didnt talk to larae willson an american housewife 
in thunder bay ont liters schmeeters i just tell the man to 
fill up the tank i follow my butcher from safeway to safeway 
because hell sell me meat in pounds 
she admits to carrying a poundkilo pocket converter you 
gotta eat 
britain decided to go metric in 1972 highway signs are still in 
miles too costly to change and a pint of bitter mild is a pint 
of bitter mild 
australia set a 10year timetable and converted in eight japan 
started metrication in 1921 and made it compulsory in 1951 saying 
sayonara to the 1193inch shaku and 8267pound kan 
in the united states the meters foreign birth is undoubtedly 
a factor in resistance to it underwood acknowledged but there 
is an enormous explosion of technology in the world its taking 
place everywhere not just america the upshot is international 
collaboration and the language of that collaboration is metric 
measurement uncertainties can have immediate effects there was 
confusion at first over just what radiation units the russians were 
using to assess radiation levels at chernobyl a canadian plane 
crashed when it ran out of fuel after a refill mixup more 
critical at a time of americas huge trade deficit is the fact that 
10 percent of the nations gross national product derives from 
foreign commerce twothirds of that being measuresensitive 
products 
if the 1975 metric act had no incisors and the university of 
michigan survey research center says only 40 percent of americans 
can name even one metric unit there is nonetheless a considerable 
metric component in us life 
sixtyfive to 68 percent of supermarket goods are prepackaged 
and 70 percent of that has metric labels says george carlton 
chairman of the food and grocery coordinating committee on 
metrication the no 2 can is standard worldwide the consumer 
knows how many kids a no 2 can will feed the rubber hits the road 
when the housewife meets the retailer at the meat counter and pays 
2205 times as much for a kilo of hamburger than she paid for a 
pound 
but wine went metric in 1978 and hard liquor in 1980 soft 
drinks have gone to twoliter bottles with no reading on the 
richter scale 
if a commodity is desired it doesnt matter if its packaged 
in swahili says al navas president of the national metric 
council in washington metric transition is going to come about 
product by product 
cars are easy because new models are always being introduced 
machinelike drill presses are adjustable by definition many small 
businesses will make whatever their customers want 
some think american industry will be predominantly metric by the 
turn of the century wilson thinks it will take 75 years 
market forces will probably be more determining than the 
government 
metrics never elected a senator says navas it isnt 
liberalconservative or republicandemocrat its apolitical i was 
on a radio talk show in detroit recently and they cut me off after 
25 minutes no one was calling in to protest metrics 
probably the bell cow in metric transition will be the pentagon 
with its 300000 suppliers in the defense industry and 15 million 
contracts a year the armys multibilliondollar lhx helicopter 
will be metric so will star wars 
last september the defense department said its policy was to use 
metric in all of its activities consistent with security 
technical logistical and safety requirements any deviation has 
to be cleared by senior officials fourteen percent of defense 
standards are already metric 
partially this is the result of the us alliance in an 
otherwise metric nato but were talking about the equipment 
well be fighting with into the 21st century says air force col 
thomas mansperger pentagon metric coordinating officer we base 
it on what we see our future needs will be and what kind of world 
were going to work in

the metric system was born in the french revolution which also 
tried and failed to create the 10day week 
the intent was to give the citizen a fairer shake with weights 
and measures than the honesty of a merchants thumb on the scale 
the paris academy of sciences decided to base the system on a 
constant physical dimension in this case one tenmillionth of the 
arc from the north pole to the equator on a meridian passing 
through paris that unit was to be called a meter from the greek 
word metron for measure 
the liter was to be the volume of a cube onetenth meter on a 
side the gram the weight of pure water at a certain temperature 
in a cube onehundredth of a meter on a side all variations of 
these basic measurements were to be to the base 10 to simplify 
their use in arithmetic 
almost at once the meter was in hot water surveyors measuring 
the distance on the meridian from dunkirk to barcelona used white 
flags as markers white was the color of the monarchists who were 
soon to see their king beheaded the surveyors kept having to talk 
their way out of jail explaining they were just inventing the 
metric system not showing support for louis xvi 
the paris assembly adopted their work in 1791 thomas jefferson 
proposed a similar decimal system a few years later when he was 
secretary of state 
the french made metrics mandatory in 1840 the us congress 
declared the system legal in 1866 in 1875 the treaty of the meter 
was signed by the united states and 16 other nations creating an 
international bureau of weights and measures near paris 
since 1893 the american yard and pound have been based on the 
meter and kilogram but the united states has yet to officially 
convert to metrics it and burma are the only nations in the world 
not to have done so

editors note some of the old color is returning to miami 
beach the art deco treasuretrove that had fallen on hard times 
now affluent young people are rediscovering the district lured by 
refurbished buildings with their pastelpainted accents and 
distinctive geometric designs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a painstaking facelift of the historic 
but seedy southern tip of miami beach appears to be more than skin 
deep 
city officials are working to ensure the projects success and 
younger more affluent tenants keep moving in 
not long ago investors remained leery of the rundown area 
uncertain whether it could be turned around by refurbishing 
historic buildings that were crumbling around the edges and cloaked 
in layers 
when the city began spurring renovation inspectors forced 
landlords to upgrade apartments and limit the number of residents 
per dwelling according to jud kurlancheek director of planning 
that along with new interest by young professionals drove up 
prices 
while the city doesnt keep track of the ethnicity of its 
residents kurlancheek says the postworld war ii eastern european 
immigrants who retired to miami beach from new york and chicago 
werent replaced generally he says the advent of condominiums 
and planned retirement communities elsewhere in south florida 
curtailed miami beachs image as a retirement haven 
the reaction among those who have stayed has been mixed some 
complain that theyve been priced out of their homes while others 
welcome the revitalization 
for saul gross a new yorker who began investing in the area 
three years ago when many were still unconvinced of the districts 
potential the payoff has been big 
everybody told me i was crazy at the time says gross 
president of the beachbased streamline development co it turns 
out i have 175 apartments and 165 of those leased in the past year 
at higher rents than anybody ever thought 
gross holdings now include 11 apartment buildings and 25000 
square feet of commercial property being renovated on washington 
avenue which cuts through the heart of the district with an area 
of about a square mile 
outoftown investors in particular have taken more of an 
interest in the district acquiring a number of the 800 or so art 
deco structures local investors have not been as quick to jump in 
some say that could soon be changing 
chuck lennon executive director of the builders association of 
south florida says local builders are geared more to large 
planned developments on virgin tracts of land as less land becomes 
available builders are likely to turn more readily to refurbishing 
projects he says 
city officials are doing their part to lure local investors 
recently they staged a twoday seminar for members of the powerful 
latin builders association to promote investment possibilities on 
the beach 
to protect and promote one of its most popular sections the 
city recently passed an amendment to its historic preservation 
ordinance that gives officials the option of imposing a permanent 
moratorium on demolition of significant buildings 
the initial 1982 ordinance only provided for a sixmonth delay 
in demolition little more than a delaying factor or 
coolingoff period to try and convince buyers of historic 
buildings not to raze them singer says 
a 10month project will begin in march to enhance pedestrian 
traffic on ocean drive where deco hotels fronting the ocean have 
become a symbol of the rebirth sidewalks will be widened to 15 
feet three times their current width and oceanside lummus park 
will be spruced up 
stuart rogel director of economic and community development 
says he recognizes the art deco district as a source of pride and 
reason for attracting people to our city whether they come to 
visit or live in the buildings its an important area for the 
city 
although only about 10 percent of the decostyle buildings have 
been renovated progress has picked up in recent years says 
richard hoberman president of the miami design preservation league 
in the past two years more than half the properties on ocean 
drive and collins avenue have changed hands hoberman says 
the direction of things six years ago was that everything was 
on the decline says denis russ executive director of the miami 
beach development corp a private nonprofit group now there 
is occurring here the development of a neighborhood fabric 
younger more affluent tenants are moving into the refurbished 
apartments which now rent for up to 850 for a twobedroom unit 
ms meyers says the average vacancy rate of redone buildings is 
about 10 percent a significant drop from a high of 30 percent 
among buildings not yet renovated 
meanwhile apartment buildings in need of upgrading which five 
years ago sold for about 12000 a unit now command up to 20000 
ms meyers says hotels that used to sell for about 6000 a room 
are going for up to 20000 especially along the ocean 
we are experiencing a change a revitalization a recycling 
and this will be a continuing phenomenom russ says i think 
its not measured in weeks or seasons but years it wont reach 
the peak of its happening for another 10 years 
ms meyers says the increased activity is snowballing 
were not yet out of the woods she says but if the 
pattern continues well see tremendous change in three years

a new generation has discovered 
americas riviera replacing the glitz and glamour that faded 
decades ago with rock music clubs quaint restaurants and 
neighborhood bars 
instead of frank sinatra sammy davis jr jerry lewis or others 
who frequented miami beach in the 50s and 60s recent visitors 
saw mick taylor and ron wood rolling stones past and present at 
woodys on the beach others heard stephen stills and savoy brown 
at the china club where doobie brothers jammed with steely dan 
and where rocker david bowie tennis star vitas gerulaitis and 
former beatles producer george martin were among the crowd 
the night life plays a great role in the revitalization of the 
entire community says mayor alex daoud 44 a miami beach native 
who can recall passing clark gable gary cooper and kirk douglas on 
the streets of his youth 
one of the largest concerns people have is where can i go at 
night when i was growing up here entertainment was very 
expensive now we have more affordable entertainment and also 
familyoriented entertainment 
in less than five years nearly 20 music clubs and restaurants 
have sprung up in formerly rundown hotels some deserted others 
occupied by the elderly poor or mariel cuban refugees 
the first time david giles a britishborn investment 
consultant walked into the future site of woodys there were 
six guys on the floor doing crack cocaine it was absolutely 
derelict 
months later giles 37 welcomed 600 people who paid 100 to 
150 each to attend a new years eve opening featuring the music of 
wood a minority investor in a european ownership group assembled 
by giles 
i still dont know if it will sustain itself but the area 
appears to have turned a corner says giles who plans to expand 
his club into a beach club with sauna exercise facilities and a 
gallery showcasing woods artwork 
jud kurlancheek city director of planning and zoning says the 
night life is a magnet for things that happen it gets people to 
come here and they look around and decide theyd like to live 
here 
unlike in suburbia where entertainment follows residential 
development the reverse appears true in urban areas kurlancheek 
says 
in the art deco district undergoing restoration as a national 
historic area the first wave brought upscale restaurants such as 
the europeanstyle cafe the strand and trendy music clubs such as 
china club woodys club nu and the tropics international now 
the neighborhood is adding the trappings of a settledin 
professional community a sushi restaurant chummy neighborhood 
bars an art decostyle burger king and soon dominos pizza 
mcdonalds and wendys fastfood restaurants 
the average age of miami beachs 100000 people dropped from 66 
in 1980 to 54 in 1985 and is projected to be under 50 by 1980 says 
kurlancheek 
young people are happy to live blocks from the beach says 
jeffrey cohen a partner in the china club the weather has 
always been the finest on the continent and now with the 
resurgence of the young people its like a rediscovery 
the shift in entertainment tastes and the onset of jet travel to 
the caribbean and other competing resorts spelled the end to miami 
beachs heyday in the 60s beach veterans say the south beach 
area was hitting bottom by the time thousands of jobless cubans 
from the 1980 mariel boatlift crowded in with the elderly eastern 
european immigrants who couldnt afford the condominium retirement 
communities springing up in south florida 
two efforts to gain legalization of casino gambling failed 
finally developers stopped looking for the quick fix and 
instead concentrated on more lasting solutions such as widening the 
eroded beach from 15 feet in places to 300 adding a boardwalk and 
reviving interest in preserving art deco styles at the same time 
tougher zoning ordinances forced landlords to make costly 
improvements the higher rents that resulted helped chase away many 
of those responsible for raising the crime rates 
many involved in the night life comeback are people in their 30s 
and 40s who have been interested in miami beach redevelopment for 
years woody graber a buffaloborn publicist whos been working 
for redevelopment and art deco preservation since 1979 says hes 
finally confident 
people are finally realizing the potential its sort of like 
helping people find a buried treasure graber says this isnt 
going to die theres too much going on for it to die now

editors note cruise ships are notorious for their food not 
the quality the quantity elaborate meals are served several times 
a day right up to the midnight buffet the head chef of one such 
ship whos in charge of getting all that food to the table shows 
what goes on in the galley 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the problem of the latterday galley 
slaves in a storm at sea was posed by the poetpassenger rudyard 
kipling who often hung over the rail in a heaving sea 
when the cabin portholes are dark and green 
because of the seas outside 
when the ship goes wop with a wiggle between 
and the steward falls into the soup tureen 
and the trunks begin to slide 
why then you will know if you havent guessed 
youre 50 north and 40 west 
that would be well off newfoundland gerd tschampel has survived 
several howling storms in even more northern latitudes like off 
spitzbergen and norways north cape without falling into the soup 
tureen 
as head chef on the 10000ton west german liner mv berlin now 
sailing off brazil gerd knows that in a really big blow more 
accidents happen in the kitchen than anywhere else on board 
we have a saying about storms at sea he says if 
something is falling dont stop it dont try to catch it get out 
of the way better to lose the soup or the sauce than suffer a 
scald 
on the relatively calm equator it was near time for the first 
dinner seating gerd was moving down the line as they call the row 
of hissing pots and pans sampling the various dishes with a large 
serving spoon 
this is usually the only meal i have time to take he said 
between slurps that occasionally provoked a sprinkle of salt or 
paprika from the palm of his hand a taste of this and a sip of 
that which means i am really eating all the time thank god from 
the beginning i have been a good sailor with no worries about rough 
weather 
for gerd just turned 35 the beginning was when his cousin came 
to their home in windsbach northern bavaria with armloads of 
exotic souvenirs from all over the world 
junk mostly i suppose like i collect now gerd laughed 
but i was l6 years old then and he was a chef on the kungsholm 
traveling everywhere i made up my mind to someday roam the globe 
like him behind a stove 
he apprenticed at a small hotel in ansbach near nuremberg with 
a gourmet dining room frequented by american air force personnel 
from a nearby base going to catering school three weeks a year and 
passing certification tests as is required in west germany gerd 
rose to the rank of souschef 
his dream became a reality via a classified ad in a restaurant 
trade paper the german liner berlin was looking for qualified 
kitchen help 
i applied for third cook the lowest rank a month later i was 
looking out a porthole at jakarta gerd recalls my cousin 
meanwhile was chef on the ferry from kiel to goteborg his wife 
said enough 
three years later gerd now head chef has learned to cope with 
the biggest difference between cooking on land and at sea at the 
hotel if you forget something you pick up the telephone out 
here you forget something forget it you have nothing 
fresh fruit and vegetables are always a problem for the growing 
number of cruise ships of many flags that spend the winter in the 
tropics 
the other day we were in martinique gerd says shaking his 
head over his menuplanning clipboard you think caribbean ports 
could supply all the melons fish and shrimp you need then you 
telex ahead for 900 kilos of something and they can only come up 
with 200 kilos right now we have too many tomatoes and not enough 
cucumbers you learn to be versatile

the following morning the berlin would dock at belem 90 miles 
up the amazon where gerd expected five tons of food to be winched 
aboard if the agent can locate it some supplies would be 
flown out from west germany where weeks before christmas the ship 
had left its home port of neustadt near hamburg with enough food 
in its freezers to last three months 
the other big difference about cooking at sea says gerd 
dipping his spoon into an enormous tray of red snapper simmering in 
almond butter is that everything is served all at once not like 
in a restaurant where orders may come hours apart 
to feed 450 passengers and 200 crew members gerd supervises a 
staff of 26 that includes a souschef a bread baker four 
butchers two pastry chefs and assorted specialists at meat fish 
soups sauces salads and ice creammaking 
eating is a roundtheclock pastime for passengers breakfast 
starts at 7 am in the dining salon or at poolside hot bouillon 
at 10 lunch is at noon in the dining room or on the lido deck 
afternoon tea with rich pastry is at 4 there are two dinner 
sittings at 6 and 8 then an elaborate midnight buffet 
when people sometimes even the captain and the doctor 
complain to me about getting too thick too fat i tell them look 
i only do the cooking you must do the eating says the lean and 
lanky chef 
gerds day is divided into two shifts he shows up in the 
gleaming tile and steel galley at 6 am takes a break at noon for 
a few hours then is back on the line at 5 or so in this job 
he says sampling the justmade kiwi fruit ice cream with hazelnut 
sauce you know when you start but you never know when you 
finish sometimes it is midnight 
menus are planned two days ahead after a nervous look at the 
larder 
on a cruise ship the chef learns to pace himself so that 
each day is better than the last gerd says the progression is 
from venison and filet mignon to boeuf wellington and lobster from 
pate de foie gras to smoked salmon to caviar it all builds to the 
captains farewell banquet when the lamps are dimmed and the 
waiters come marching in behind the ships orchestra with flaming 
baked alaska held proudly on high 
then in ritual rich as king neptunes court at the crossing of 
the equator the captain gives his little speech and introduces his 
officers and the cruise staff but the loudest applause always 
rings out for the chef 
since the berlin flies the west german flag the menu at lunch 
usually features a regional specialty like gefuellte kalbsbrust 
heidelberg stuffed breast of veal or kaiserschmarren luscious 
tyrolean pancakes the sixcourse dinner from pate and soup to 
cheese board and exotic pastry invariably offers a choice of three 
entrees 
the cuisine is continental but menu choices do not seem to vary 
regardless of whether german french or americans predominate the 
passenger list with some 400 guests studying his daily 
delectations gerd can predict within 20 or 30 portions which 
of the three entrees will be the most in demand 
that way we dont waste much food he says also the 
weather is a factor people eat less here in the tropics on the 
chilly north cape run they never stop eating 
in the pecking order at sea gerd is entitled to wear an 
officers uniform with three stripes on the sleeve the equivalent 
rank of first mate or first engineer but he prefers a white apron 
and the toque blanche the tall chefs hat that crowns his 
profession and always brings down the house 
in germany he mused over a steaming cauldron of crab and 
spinach soup cooking is still a respected profession but young 
people dont want it the hours are too long the work too hard 
and youre never off on weekends christmas or easter every cruise 
i am breaking in four or five new cooks they stay for two or three 
years and then the wife or the girlfriend says enough well you 
cant blame them the sea is for dreamers

editors note camel caravans still wend across the sahara 
desert in northern niger as they have done for centuries but 
droughts in this decade have wiped out most livestock herds 
putting an end to the wandering of the nomadic tuaregs in villages 
such as agadez many have been reduced to hawking jewelry to 
tourists or scratching a meager garden out of the sand 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the evening call to prayer from a medieval 
minaret echoes through the sand streets to a market stall next to 
the sultans palace where abdou amadou sells nomad souvenirs and 
dreams of hondas 
the souvenirs are mere remnants of a fabulous desert culture 
that once flourished in agadez then a bustling crossroad of the 
great transsaharan trade 
the village is now an impoverished outpost in the landlocked 
west african nation of niger one of the poorest and most anonymous 
countries on earth but agadez manages to survive living off the 
legacy of the saharas golden age 
abdou 16 is watching the shop while his grandfather prays on a 
straw mat outside in the street two tourists browse through the 
sabers jewelry and camel saddles hanging on the wall 
its nomad abdou says pointing to a bracelet its 
silver ill make you a good price 
as the tourists walk away abdou says in french i want to 
sell enough to buy a honda someday and do a motorcross it would be 
marvelous his grandfather returns and speaking quietly in 
tamanjek tells abdou to get back to work 
tamanjek is the language of the tuareg nomads who for a 
thousand years lived and wandered in the onceborderless sahara 
desert that is now northern niger 
crafts and caravans as well as tourism are essential 
structural supports for the economy of northern niger a country 
with a population of about 7 million and an average per capita 
income of 270 a year 
the caravan route to timbuktu originated in agadez and was 
followed by arabs turks and egyptians the wealthy traders of the 
medieval world including a few europeans kept agents in agadez to 
expedite the flow of goods south to black africa and north to the 
mediterranean ports 
the gateway to the sahara agadez linked europe and africa 
white world and black the route came to symbolize the mystery of 
africa 
throughout the middle ages and continuing until two centuries 
ago huge caravans crisscrossed the desert waste sometimes lines 
of up to 40000 camels stretched to the shimmering horizon tuareg 
nomads proud and independent served as escorts camel handlers 
and guides across the unmarked sand nomad craftsmen made saddles 
sabers and other gear for the trail while other tuaregs bred camels 
to replace those lost to exhaustion and thirst 
crossing the desert was a complicated and dangerous business 
tens of thousands of human and animal skeletons lie buried beneath 
the sand whole convoys died from lack of water or heat or fell 
victim to bandits black africans perished on the forced march 
north to slavery or were worked to death more slowly in the desert 
salt pits 
the pits not far from agadez near the libyan border are still 
being worked although not by slaves and the transport still is 
handled in the cool winter months by camel caravans scores of 
caravans carry salt to feed the livestock of farmers in the more 
fertile south to the north they return with millet dates and 
wheat 
caravans appear suddenly from behind dunes like an illustration 
from arabian nights or frames from a hollywood foreign legion film 
the camels glide across the top of dunes tied in a line their 
hooves trailing plumes of sand beside them walk the nomads in 
robes that billow like sails in the wind from their belts swing 
curved carved sabers symbols of the tuaregs warrior past 
the caravan trade still feeds some families but many tuaregs in 
agadez have been reduced to hawking jewelry to tourists or 
scratching a meager garden out of the sand droughts in this decade 
have wiped out most herds putting an end to the nomads wandering 
and livelihood government policies that encourage the nomads to 
settle down have accelerated the change to a sedentary life

the descendant of a line that dates at least to the 10th 
century sultan ibrahim spent one recent morning negotiating movie 
rights to film a caravan 
the sultan reclined on a carpet by an open fire in the dark 
palace slowly spinning a silver cylinder of snuff in his hand 
across from him on lawn chairs sat a reporter and producer from the 
british broadcasting co nervously negotiating 
they explained their plan to an old whiterobed interpreter who 
translated it from french for the sultan and his retinue the 
sultans black eyes the only part of his head not concealed by an 
abundant turban revealed nothing but inscrutable reserve 
after a while he raised his hand and discussion of details 
ceased between the bbc and a barefoot caravaner he approved 30 
camels and agreed to outfit the caravan for a reasonable price 
and agreed to be interviewed on camera for the trade route film 
thirty camels can go now without danger the sultan says 
it is no longer necessary to travel in large groups for 
protection 
the danger facing agadez these days he says is not other men 
but nature 
it is getting drier the water table is falling and we have 
not had a good rain in two years he says it is difficult to 
say exactly what is happening 
we have enough water for the moment for our 30000 people and 
there is enough fodder but any further loss of pasture and there 
will be no livestock left i dont know about will happen to the 
people 
the spread of the sahara is the biggest problem in agadez in 
the region in all of niger desertification and the environment 
was the top priority listed by the new government when it took over 
in november the new chief of state is ali seibou the third man to 
lead niger since it gained independence from france three decades 
ago 
col seibou leader of the nigerien military took over nov 17 
from president seyna kountche who died in a paris hospital of a 
brain tumor seibou immediately was chosen to head the sevenman 
ruling supreme military council 
already known for his leadership in efficiently distributing 
food throughout niger during the 1984 famine seibou increased his 
popularity by releasing about 200 political prisoners and reducing 
police presence in niamey the capital articles mildly critical of 
the government began appearing in the press the atmosphere seemed 
looser people said 
the transition of power was especially smooth when compared to 
other west african nations where violent coups detat often mark 
the change in government nigers reputation for stability has been 
strengthened in international circles including the united states 
international affairs even national ones receive little 
attention in agadez where there are only a couple of television 
sets and one plane a week lands on the sandswept airstrip near 
town tradition is what matters 
even the way of saying hello on the street is rooted in the 
saharas golden age the tuareg have a complicated and courteous 
way of greeting each other exchanging several phrases before 
conversation begins softly spoken ritualistic phrases which 
everyone knows by heart sometimes go on for a minute or more 
salum alaikum they begin peace to you 
alaikum wa salam peace to you too 
yak lo bas no evil to you 
lo bas no evil 
lo bas hamdullah no evil thanks to god 
as the phrases continue the men look each other over the 
ritual was useful for sizing up a stranger on the desert 
identifying his tribe 
abdou sporting a georgia historical society tshirt given to 
him by a foreign friend thinks the greeting is oldfashioned but 
he respects the ancient traditions knowing that this is what 
brings the tourists to his grandfathers shop 
you want to go see the camel market outside town he asks a 
visitor i can borrow my brothers motorcycle and take you 
there

here are some facts and figures on niger 
the land located on the southern edge of the sahara between 
libya and nigeria niger is a landlocked nation of 490000 square 
miles the size of texas and california combined most of it 
uninhabited desert 
more than a century of french colonial rule ended peacefully on 
aug 8 1960 the nigeriens adopted a constitution three months 
later that was suspended following a military coup in 1974 
the people the population estimated at 7 million is largely 
made up of three ethnic groups the hausa who also constitute the 
major ethnic group of northern nigeria represent half the total 
population and the djermasonghai a quarter most are concentrated 
in the southern more fertile part of the country the rest of the 
nigeriens are nomadic or seminomadic peoples wandering the deserts 
of the north including the tuareg fulani kanouri and toubou 
each ethnic group has its own language and customs but the hausa 
language is the one most widely spoken ninetyeight percent of the 
population is moslem the birthrate is one of the worlds highest 
increasing at 34 percent per year the average life expectancy is 
45 
the economy despite the development of uranium mining in recent 
years niger remains a very poor country 97 percent covered in 
sand uranium output peaked in 1981 and declined after prices fell 
owing to worldwide cuts in nuclear power programs the falling 
uranium prices caused the rate of economic growth to plummet from 
12 percent in 1979 to 42 percent in 1985 
nigers gross national product per head declined in real terms 
by an average of 16 percent annually between 1960 and 1981 per 
capita income in 1987 was estimated at 270 a year the decline in 
the economy combined with an exploding population and recurring 
drought niger is thought to be the country that was most severely 
affected by the 1984 drought and resulting food shortages 
about 90 percent of nigers work force is employed in some form 
of agriculture or herding the principal food crops are millet and 
sorghum the main cash crops are peanuts cotton and cowpeas 
history the british were the first to explore the upper reaches 
of the niger river beginning with the scotsman mungo park who 
disappeared there in 1806 but it was the french who colonized it 
between 1891 and 1911 the country was not fully pacified until 
much later and there were a number of resistance movements which 
challenged colonial power the most serious being the siege of 
agadez by tuareg nomad warriors in 191617 
its colonial history and development paralleled that of other 
french west african territories administered from paris through 
the governor general at dakar senegal and governors in the 
individual territories the country gained independence in 1960 
but remained staunchly profrench 
the constitution adopted in 1960 was suspended in april 1974 
following a coup in which seyni kountche ousted hamani diori who 
had served since independence but was accused of corruption 
particularly with regard to the distribution of food aid 
in november 1987 kountche died in a paris hospital following a 
long illness and was immediately replaced by his chief aide and the 
head of the 4000man nigerien military ali seibou 
the country has been ruled since 1974 by a supreme military 
council and all basic powers have been vested in it political 
parties are banned a cabinet composed of both civilians and 
military personnel administers the country the government has 
promised to reinstate a constitution and parliament 
niger pursues a neutral moderate foreign policy and maintains 
friendly relations with both east and west

british actress jane seymour says she found 
much to admire in wallis simpson the american divorcee who became 
the duchess of windsor the woman the english loved to hate 
she was the woman who stole their king says seymour who 
portrays simpson in the cbs movie the woman he loved 
they hated her she was a naive american who didnt understand 
the monarchy or how it worked or what it stood for she thought 
david could make her his queen 
instead david already king edward viii but not yet crowned 
was forced to abdicate in 1936 to marry wallis they became the 
duke and duchess of windsor and lived the rest of their lives in 
exile 
the twohour movie which cbs will televise on sunday also 
stars anthony andrews as david olivia de havilland as wallis aunt 
bessie julie harris as her mother lucy gutteridge as another 
woman who saw herself as davids queen robert hardy as winston 
churchill and phyllis calvert as queen mary 
ive never heard anyone say a good word about her seymour 
says other than that she gave great dinner parties but i liked 
her she had a sense of humor a straightforwardness she was 
definitely attentive to her husband and although she was no 
beauty she had style and elegance i certainly wouldnt trust her 
with my husband 
its boring to play a perfect person but to play a woman who 
was not liked and to find something about her that is likeable is 
fascinating 
seymour says she saw david as a weak man who never really wanted 
to be king wallis simpson fulfilled some of his needs 
rumor has it that wallis learned to do sexual tricks when she 
lived in china she says the king had a few problems in that 
area and she fixed them 
when wallis first met david he was the prince of wales and she 
was married to american businessman ernest simpson the flirtation 
turned to romance and simpsons marriage to divorce her plan was 
to marry david and become queen but the british prime minister and 
royal family forbade his marriage as king to a twicedivorced woman 
the woman he loved takes a different and less political 
approach than the britishmade miniseries edward and mrs 
simpson which ran on pbs several years ago 
english newspapers became heavily involved with the making of 
the woman he loved and seymour says one paper seemed to give 
royal status to her roleplaying the times published seymours 
picture as the duchess at davids funeral it went on the court 
circular page a serious chronicle of royal events 
i tried to play her in various shades of gray seymour says 
i play her the way i believe she was thinking at the time she 
was manipulating things she had a great plan and it didnt work i 
purposely dont play her sympathetically 
parts of the movie were filmed in western england where seymour 
owns a 15thcentury estate outside the old roman spa city of bath 
she stayed at her home st catherines court during that time 
seymour divides her time between england where she is still a 
citizen and this country where she has lived for the past 10 
years she and her husband american businessman david flynn have 
two children katie 5 born here and sean 2 born in england 
she works mostly in american television and films having shed 
her english accent in order to play american roles 
seymour was on her way to spain to play opera star maria callas 
in the abc miniseries onassis the richest man in the world 
the fourhour miniseries which tells of the romance between callas 
and greek magnate aristotle onassis raul julia will be televised 
in early may 
she has already completed her role as natalie jastrow henry in 
war and remembrance the 30hour miniseries being readied for

liliane montevecchi is a french singerdancer 
whose cabaret show on the boulevard opened in february and 
keeps getting extended at the tiny offbroadway kaufman theater 
whether she will let it extend into the summer she cant say 
i dont make plans i do whatever pleases me 
im like a cork on the ocean and just let it ride she says 
in french accented english her words punctuated by a hearty laugh 
her father was italian her mother french she grew up in paris 
she was the star of the folies bergere for 10 years minus the 
feathers of the folies shes doing her first onewoman show 
in on the boulevard she wears a black longsleeved 
miniskirted dress accenting her gamine face svelte figure and 
shapely legs after intermission for a boulevard stroll she 
belts on a very frenchlooking trench coat she bought it for 25 
in a salvation army store near the manhattan apartment where shes 
staying this cork on the ocean doesnt keep a permanent 
apartment in paris or new york 
the songs in the show sung mostly in english arent all 
french but the singer whose name is pronounced montevekky makes 
it might as well be spring sound as french as autumn leaves 
critic clive barnes called her an americanstyled but never 
americanized impression of a reality that is itself so brilliant 
so telling and so touching that it becomes a new and lovely reality 
in its own right 
tommy tune who chose miss montevecchi for nine on broadway 
planned on the boulevard with her but his name isnt in the 
program she says he did it for me as a friend the critics were 
so good he should have the recognition he deserves i asked him and 
he said now that youre well on your way do what you want it 
is so brilliantly pulled together in that little theater not an 
easy theater to work with 
the first time we came to the theater and sat there he said 
i see you higher we didnt know how yet a boulevard was not 
even thought of they eventually decided on a raised diagonal 
walkway across the tiny stage 
we were there moved around thought aloud did booboos it 
was being unafraid to do things that are not good then clean it 
up i always rehearse in a black leotard i can see where the body 
goes we started with a leotard covered with diamonds i had from a 
long time ago for the show it was too much 
they didnt try for a single mood like nostalgia we should 
have variety she says alive alive alive and true you 
cannot cheat the public they dont know why but they feel when it 
is true the public is very intelligent you see 
miss montevecchi thinks her singing has improved life makes 
you different the sorrow joy people you lose the songs are 
closer to my heart and im not afraid any more tommy and i say we 
are finished to be afraid now we attack 
tommy decided no more hats or glittering gowns i attack with 
pleasure i feel very comfortable with that i took a risk i 
guess if one doesnt take a risk one stays in a rut 
tune first saw and heard the 5foot6inch dancersinger during 
auditions for broadways nine which he directed 
she had played in atlantic city for 18 months on contracts 
renewed in threemonth increments from atlantic city she went to 
hollywood where she once had a sevenyear mgm contract to try to 
reenter films 
i didnt get a thing not even a radio spot i cant wait i 
try and if it doesnt work i disappear i decided to go back to 
paris i stopped here to visit a friend and called my agent he 
said its funny you called tomorrow theres an audition for a 
play which requires accents 
i went there i was not prepared at all i didnt have a 
pianist i sang la vie en rose tommy liked me he didnt have a 
part for me but he wanted me in the show why not have me play the 
part of a producer originally written for a man because of me the 
cast except for raul julia became all women 
the timing of things is incredible 
in paris at age 9 miss montevecchi started ballet lessons 
sent by a mother who had wanted to be a ballerina she didnt 
push me too hard i loved it i still love it today i go to ballet 
class every day it is my drug my equilibrium my love what makes 
me breathe 
roland petit saw miss montevecchi dance as a teenager hired 
her for his ballet company and three months later when she was 18 
named her prima ballerina she stayed three years before a screen 
test took her to hollywood where she attended school with 
kindergarteners to learn english 
after hollywood came la plume de ma tante on broadway and 
on tour a play in europe and 10 years of starring in the folies 
bergere in new york where it flopped las vegas and paris she 
wasnt topless miss montevecchi says ballet is a very proper 
thing and i always kept this and i was the star of it in 17 
enormous costumes a night with huge huge feathers from catherine 
of russia to a tango queen 
her mother died last year in paris miss montevecchi says i 
spent five months in paris i had to do things i came back here

as an angry young man in the 
1960s jackie ntuane spent more than three years in prison for his 
political activism 
as a prosperous insurance executive today he says his focus is 
on economic independence 
ntuane is part of a growing black south african middle class 
which has found opportunities in the business world even while 
locked out of national politics 
this emerging business class though still small sees black 
economic development as the neglected partner of black political 
advancement both are viewed as necessary ingredients in 
dismantling apartheid the governments policies of racial 
segregation 
economics and politics are part of the same struggle for 
blacks said ntuane who manages a 50member branch office for 
the old mutual insurance company 
blacks must succeed in both areas if they are to take control 
of their own lives added ntuane who was imprisoned for 
belonging to the outlawed pan africanist congress 
the south african economy by far the largest and most advanced 
in africa requires an ever increasing number of middleclass 
professionals blacks have begun to fill that demand and some 
clear signs of black economic progress are emerging 
black households earned an average of 406 rand 203 a month 
in 1986 more than double the figure in 1981 and nearly six times 
higher than in 1975 according to market research africa a private 
firm however black households still earn less than 20 percent of 
the average white family income 
the new lesedi city shopping mall east of johannesburg has 
more than 50 blackrun businesses and is the largest shopping 
complex yet built in a black area 
black taxi drivers banding together in a nationwide 
association over the past decade have taken away a huge portion of 
black commuter ridership from whiteowned bus companies 
shareworld a disneylandstyle amusement park in soweto opened 
several months ago and is believed the largest enterprise in the 
country controlled by black shareholders a total of 880 black 
investors hold 60 percent of the stock 
there are success stories but they remain the exception 
said gabriel mokgoko spokesman for the national african federated 
chamber of commerce blacks still are not part of the economic 
mainstream 
the middle class remains a small fraction of the countrys 26 
million blacks blacks make up about 75 percent of the population 
but only 5 percent of the executives and managers black businesses 
account for only 1 percent of south africas gross national 
product according to black enterprise magazine 
black businesses face obstacles on several fronts including 
hostility from their own community where many younger blacks see 
the business world as an extension of apartheid and white 
domination 
capitalism has become a discredited system to hundreds of 
thousands of black south africans the editors of black 
enterprise wrote recently to many of our younger students and 
graduates even its name is an anathema and earns thinly 
disguised ridicule and contempt 
dr nthato motlana a prominent antiapartheid activist said 
blacks have become increasingly hostile to business and have failed 
to perceive black buying power as a political weapon 
the attitude of young black activists and the unions is most 
unfortunate he said recently this message must go out to the 
political activists blacks need to make money too blacks have no 
political power but they should translate their consumer power 
into economic power 
a longheld theory in the white business establishment is that 
apartheid will wither as the economy develops and blacks are drawn 
into the middle class 
business has proved less resistent to blacks than most other 
fields and the workplace is the most frequent point of multiracial 
interaction in a country where neighborhoods and public schools 
remain segregated 
but black leaders say white business has done far less than it 
could to assist blacks 
white business climbed on the back of the apartheid political 
system years ago and thats where it remains today said mokgoko 
business pays lip service to racial reform but they have never 
exercised their power to help dismantle apartheid or assist blacks 
economically 
blacks are the largest consumers of most basic necessities such 
as food and clothing yet most black businesses are relatively 
small operations limited to black townships 
south africa has no nationwide blackowned chains and only one 
of the more than 500 companies listed on the johannesburg stock 
exchange a group of six bakeries is run by blacks 
blacks have no credible representation in any of the major 
economic sectors such as mining agriculture manufacturing the 
financial institutions even retailing reuel khoza the black 
managing director of shareworld wrote recently in leadership 
magazine 
by whatever index we use black economic activity is so 
insignificant as to be almost nonexistent khoza wrote 
economic life in soweto the huge township outside johannesburg 
is typical of many black areas most shops are momandpop 
operations and a substantial informal business sector of street 
vendors exists 
but the township of an estimated 25 million people has no 
large central business district or shopping area soweto residents 
are more likely to shop at whiteowned businesses in johannesburg 
than in their neighborhoods 
by far the largest industry in soweto is shebeens illegal bars 
an estimated 4000 of them outnumbering all other businesses 
combined 
black businessmen say the townships will remain underdeveloped 
until bankers become willing to invest in black areas south africa 
has more than 50 banks but only one the african bank is 
blackrun and makes most of its loans to the black community 
regulation and statute have reduced us to a nation of 
smalltime merchants running essentially oneman operations 
khoza wrote 
our political spirit has never been crushed but our assault 
on the economic edifice of apartheid has been lamentable he 
added in the economic field we must create a mythology of 
competence of high motivation and high ideals in pursuit of 
economic liberation

every workday morning and 
evening the road between johannesburg and soweto is lined with 
vans taking blacks to and from their jobs 
known as combis the vans are privately owned taxis that 
have contributed to one of the countrys leading black business 
success stories 
an estimated 100000 combis operate nationwide and almost all 
are run by blacks for blacks 
the black taxi industry is a clear example of the black 
entrepreneurial flair that exists in south africa when it is 
allowed to flourish said james chapman a white who is spokesman 
for the southern african bus and taxi association sabta 
for decades most urban blacks were at the mercy of inefficient 
and inconvenient train and bus systems for their daily trips from 
the outlying townships into the cities where they worked 
when black taxi drivers began appearing in the late 1970s they 
faced a range of restrictions including limits on the number of 
passengers and the requirement that those in each ride be of the 
same race 
but sabta a cooperative with 45000 members successfully 
fought regulatory curbs and has become an increasingly powerful 
force in the transport industry since its formation in 1979 
sabta has an annual budget of more than 60 million rand 30 
million runs 16 gas and service stations for members and 
arranges discounts on parts and repairs the organization also has 
persuaded the toyota and nissan automotive plants in south africa 
to modify their vans to better accommodate the needs of taxi 
drivers 
seventy percent of the associations members own only one or two 
taxi vans but most are doing well financially sabta says 
successful black taxi drivers in urban areas earn as much as 
1000 rand 500 a month making them among the highestearning 
black group in the country said godfrey ntlatleng the 
associations vice president the average monthly income for a 
black household in south africa is 406 rand 203 
i had to work a lot of 16hour days but i always wanted to be 
my own boss said ntlatleng who started with one taxi and now 
oversees a fleet of several combis 
to join sabta members pay an annual 100rand 50 fee and 
become part of the local association that sets rates and handles 
administrative functions the current fare for the trip between 
johannesburg and soweto costs the equivalent of 60 cents and most 
vans carry 10 or 15 passengers 
sabtas membership and resources have been expanding rapidly 
although the organization failed last year in an attempt to 
takeover the nations largest bus system putco for 150 million 
rand 75 million 
it was a temporary setback said chapman but weve proven 
were a force to be reckoned with

the sweeping capitalist revolution in britain is 
prime minister margaret thatchers 
but her top treasury official chancellor of the exchequer nigel 
lawson is the architect of the astounding turnaround in britains 
economy the worlds fifth largest 
once an economic laughing stock plagued by strikes high 
interest rates and inflation that coined the phrase the british 
disease britain is in its seventh consecutive year of economic 
growth and expanding faster than most of its major trading partners 
at a projected 3 percent in 1988 britains growth will outstrip 
the united states 23 percent and west germanys 17 percent and 
stand second only to japans 42 percent 
the base lending rate is down from a peak of 16 percent in 1981 
to 85 percent the annual inflation rate has been reined in from 
18 percent in 1980 to 4 percent last year 
now with a budget unveiled march 15 that will radically reform 
the tax structure lawsons accomplishments as the main architect 
of mrs thatchers economic policies rank him as one of britains 
boldest and most respected chancellors 
i think you can certainly say that certainly in the postwar 
period said ian harwood a chief economist at the london 
investment firm warburg securities 
he compares well with other chancellors said diane coyoe a 
british economist with the private forecasting firm dri europe 
hes been a very handson chancellor so he has to get a lot of 
the credit for it 
she added he will certainly be well remembered 
lawsons opponents in the socialistic labor party disagree they 
shouted down his budget speech when he announced big tax cuts for 
high earners and one was expelled from the house of commons for 
calling his strategy an utter obscenity 
lawsons fifth budget marked his zenith with the nineyearold 
conservative governments biggest tax reform 
reducing the income tax categories from six to two he slashed 
the rate for britains highest income earners from 60 percent to 
40 and set a basic rate of 25 percent the lowest since 1938 
in a testament to the governments tight fiscal spending 
policies 198788 produced the first budget surplus in almost 20 
years 
rich mans budget stormed the opposition laborites but a 
large conservative majority in the house of commons assures its 
passage 
lawson proudly predicted another year of healthy and 
noninflationary economic growth despite the october stock 
markets crash and repeated his common boast 
the british economy is stronger than at any time since the 
war we have followed the right policies and stuck to them 
the governments critics say that if this is a success story 
the price is too high 
they say the poor the unemployed and the sick have been 
abandoned by fiscal spending policies short on social conscience 
mrs thatcher argues that only a strong economy can protect the 
weak 
the critics also maintain that unemployment at a rate of 91 
percent is too high lawson notes it was above 11 percent 18 
months ago 
economists also worry about the trade deficit which is expected 
to triple to 74 billion in 1988 
britains surplus in oil trade which was 74 billion in 1987 
equal to the expected trade deficit disguises the real extent of 
the countrys trade imbalance the critics say 
they also contend that falling oil prices played a significant 
part in slowing the growth rate from 45 percent last year to the 
projected 3 percent 
lawsons critics also say manufacturing output hasnt fully 
recovered from the recession of the early 1980s it will grow by 
55 percent in 1988 lawson said but the governments most recent 
manufacturing output index stood at 1135 in january still below 
its record 1168 in june 1974 
in addition the labor unrest that mrs thatcher had curbed with 
laws limiting union power has picked up with a variety of strikes 
in recent months 
but the government says 339 million work days were lost to 
strikes last year up from a 34year low of 192 million in 1986 
but much lower than the 1970s average 
lawson like mrs thatcher doesnt waver from his agenda which 
has the prime ministers almost unqualified endorsement 
he has held his own opinions and followed them ms coyoe 
said 
his relationship with mrs thatcher is not always harmonious 
however just before budget day they disagreed over how much the 
government should intervene to stem the increase in the value of 
the british pound against other major currencies 
mrs thatcher stood by her freemarket convictions while lawson 
feared that without intervention a strong pound would hurt 
britains exports and corporate profits 
short boyishfaced chubby with a shock of black hair and a 
tart sense of humor lawson is the son of a jewish latvian 
immigrant who became a london tea merchant 
lawson graduated from oxford university in economics politics 
and philosophy and was a journalist before being elected to 
parliament in 1974 in 1979 he became a junior treasury minister in 
mrs thatchers first government 
he became chancellor in 1983 the first trained economist to 
hold the post since 1951 and began as a monetarist vowing to 
extinguish inflation by controlling the growth in britains money 
supply and government borrowing 
today he is a supplysider who advocates tax cuts and restrained 
fiscal spending supplyside economists believe increasing the 
money available for investment will boost productivity 
lawson lives with his second wife and two young children at 11 
downing st next door to the thatchers at no 10 
despite being credited with a large part in winning mrs 
thatcher her third consecutive term of office lawsons political 
future is uncertain critics say the chancellor is not sociable 
enough to garner support to lead the party in the unlikely event 
that the unflagging mrs thatcher would step down 
i think he would make a very good prime minister harwood 
said whether he would have a chance is another question 
the british press has speculated that after five years in the 
thatcher cabinet lawson is tired and frustrated and might take a 
lucrative job in the city londons financial district 
lawson says that while his tax reform is complete it is too 
soon to say whether he will be presenting next years budget

the shabby 64room motel where martin 
luther king jr died is closed emptied of its last stubborn 
resident surrounded by a chainlink fence 8 feet high and awaiting 
renovation the slums are as full as ever 
dr king was about the business of poor people at the time of 
his death and today there are more poor black people in memphis 
than there were then said maxine smith executive secretary of 
the local naacp 
king was shot to death at the lorraine motel on april 4 1968 
and civil rights leaders say the 20th anniversary of his 
assassination should remind the nation that the battles he fought 
remain unwon 
the attention of the country should be on memphis said 
james e smith director of local 1733 of the american federation 
of state county and municipal employees 
king was in memphis to support striking city garbage men when he 
was slain on april 3 the union will sponsor a memorial service at 
the mason temple where he delivered one of his most famous 
speeches 
ive been to the mountain top king told his followers the 
night before his death i may not get there with you but i want 
you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised 
land 
a poorpeoples pilgrimage through mississippi alabama and 
georgia will begin april 4 in memphis with a wreathlaying ceremony 
at the lorraine 
a program of speeches and music to be staged at a downtown 
theater april 4 will be the first event the city has ever sponsored 
in kings honor 
i think anybody who is familiar with memphis politics memphis 
society would have thought you were crazy if you said five or 10 
years ago that memphis was going to sponsor an official city 
tribute to dr king said the rev kenneth whalum jr chairman 
of a commission appointed by mayor richard hackett to coordinate 
the city program 
it speaks volumes about the progress we have made whalum 
said 
the city and county governments have put up 22 million each to 
match 44 million from the state for a civil rights museum at the 
lorraine and museum supporters say it indicates memphis is less 
worried about being identified as the city where king was killed 
there had to be time for people to realize that the impact of 
the movement and dr king was not a passing moment said darmy 
bailey a prime mover behind the project the lorraine didnt 
become less important over the years it became more important 
the city must recognize it has a special place in history 
because king was killed here he said 
it is a remarkable challenge that we have to continually 
answer to show we are making some progress toward racial and 
economic justice bailey said there is essentially a white 
memphis and a black memphis but i dont see that most other 
american cities are any different i think we are trying here 
despite progress however other community leaders say racial 
and economic divisions in memphis are still sharp 
we have a long way to go in healing the wounds of kings 
assassination and in addressing racial polarization said willie 
herenton superintendent of memphis schools he said conditions for 
the hardcore poor had changed little in two decades 
theres a lot of hopelessness and despair he said 
jacqueline smith 37 who was forcibly evicted from the lorraine 
on march 2 after living there nine years remains camped out on the 
sidewalk in protest the former lorraine chambermaid and waitress 
thinks the motel should be converted to a shelter for the homeless 
im trying to help the people who live in this area she 
said as she was being evicted were being forced out of the 
neighborhood 
the us census bureau says memphis population of 558000 in 
1968 was about 40 percent black in 1987 the population was 
estimated at 652000 and 50 percent black 
in 1970 the median income for blacks in memphis was about half 
that of whites and a 1987 report on local poverty by the shelby 
county mayors office says that margin has not lessened 
almost half of the black families in memphis live in poverty 
the report says and 79 percent of the children in city schools 
live near or below the poverty level seventyeight percent of the 
107000 students in the schools are black 
if you look at the percentage of property ownership and things 
like that where the money is blacks are still mainly on the 
outside said charles crawford a history professor at memphis 
state university 
but kings assassination in this city permanently changed the 
citys racial attitudes 
there was a feeling of real shock that it had happened and 
maybe like president john kennedys assassination in dallas that 
it had happened here crawford said it brought about a much 
more sudden acceptance of the necessity of integration 
after kings death blacks greatly increased their involvement 
in city politics crawford said and white politicians began taking 
them more seriously 
in 1967 the citys registered voters broke down to 152562 
whites and 78655 blacks now 181539 whites 175395 blacks and 
14180 others are registered 
three of the 13 city council members are black the same as 20 
years ago and four members of the 11member shelby county 
commission are black

editors note like thomas chippendale 18th century 
cabinetmaker and woodworking artist before him wendell castle is 
both a sculptor who makes furniture and a furniture craftsman who 
makes sculpture experts say hes currently acknowledged to be the 
only major artist working in furniture 
</TEXT>

wendell castle the kingpin of art 
furniture in the united states takes delight in creating pieces 
that sometimes defy definition 
his work whether its a chair with a wooden suit coat draped 
over it or a cabinet that appears destined to topple over always 
seems to have a fooled you again quality 
the 55yearold artist has found an interesting niche between 
the art and furniture worlds 
for example a ladderlike impractical sculpture contains a 
tiny working cabinet a beautifully crafted table has an open book 
and eyeglasses carved out of wood sitting atop the delicate inlay 
he can turn wood into wrinkled sheets and cabinets into 
spectacular sculpture 
castle trying to explain his career recently to an acquaintance 
who is an attorney told him i make art furniture 
in this case that statement didnt help matters castle 
recalls so i said its sort of halfway between being furniture 
and sculpture 
that is exactly what i do but whether that description means 
anything to a lawyer i dont know 
castle is a sculptor who makes furniture a furniture craftsman 
who makes sculpture 
his creations sell for anywhere from 8000 to 130000 they 
have been shown in art galleries and on the pages of woodworking 
magazines 
his two most important commissions recently have been designing 
the 500000th steinway piano and a 19foot tall clock sculpture in 
downtown toronto 
castle a slender bearded man who wears halfglasses when he 
delicately trims blocks of wood on a band saw doesnt mind being a 
man without a label in fact he prefers it 
i sort of bounce back and forth he says whenever i get 
real close to one or stay close to one for very long it bothers 
me staying in the middle is more difficult but theres where i 
really want to be 
in the art world castle is well known as the only major artist 
working in furniture a field that has a rich history dating back 
to the renaissance says art historian penelope hunterstiebel 
probably the most recognizable artist of this type is thomas 
chippendale the 18th century english cabinetmaker says 
huntersteibel a former curator at metropolitan museum of art in 
new york who acquired a castle loveseat for the museum theres 
been lots of cabinetmakers but only a few artists wendell castle 
is one of the few 
in the furniture world castles name is a household word 
among woodworkers and furniture designers says paul bertorelli a 
senior editor at taunton press publisher of fine woodworking 
magazine 
castle graduated from the university of kansas with an 
undergraduate degree in industrial design and a masters degree in 
sculpture 
he painted abstract expressionist art before coming to the 
rochester institute of technology in 1962 and starting his 
innovative career that took him to brockport state college in 1970 
and then to his own furniture design school in 1980 
during that time hes created some of the worlds 
strangestlooking chairs desks clocks and book shelves hes 
tackling a musical instrument for the first time 
ive never even made a guitar ive been interested in 
building a piano for maybe 10 years he says castle was 
approached by the smithsonian institution about building a piano in 
the 1970s but the project fell through 
castle was given the prestigious commission of designing the 
500000th steinway model d grand piano last summer and submitted 10 
designs to steinway amp sons 
all of the designs were somewhat conservative at least by 
castles standards 
there wouldnt be any point in reinventing the piano he 
says and since the steinway model d is the standard concert 
instrument in the world i didnt think it would be smart to deviate 
from it too much 
the 100000th steinway is in the smithsonian and the 200000th 
presented to president franklin d roosevelt in 1938 is in the 
east room of the white house 
castles design uses dark ebony and striped indian ebony wood to 
create an elegant angular shape with large boxy legs 
the names of the more than 1000 steinway artists such as 
vladimir horowitz and van cliburn who chose to play steinways 
professionally will be etched into the dark ebony 
in his workshop castle gently brushes the sawdust from the 
dark unfinished wood as he explains how moving the rear leg on his 
design dramatically changed the pianos sound 
the rear leg he says is always found on the edge of the piano 
so it wont affect the vibrations that produce the instruments 
sounds 
but i dont like the look of that so were going to do a 
little bit of extra work so we can put the leg here castle said 
pointing to an area in the middle of the piano 
the change will require the construction of a bridgelike device 
that will keep the leg from actually touching the underside of the 
center of the piano 
the piano will be unveiled june 2 at a gala celebration in 
carnegie hall in new york and will then begin a tour of the worlds

giant car company

marks or 140 a share beginning thursday according to a 
statement by the finance ministry the price set by the finance 
ministry is a slight discount from volkswagens current cost of 240 
marks a share

expects to make some 114 billion marks on the deal the ministry 
said 
the shares will be sold through a consortium of 75 west german 
and foreign banks led by dresdner bank deutsche bank commerzbank 
and others

scandal in the companys foreign exchange division that cost 
millions of marks 
plans to reschedule the sale for late in the year were shelved 
shortly after the oct 19 stock market crash that sent share prices 
plummeting around the world 
analysts say the government is going ahead with the transaction 
now because it is faced with a widerthanexpected federal budget 
deficit in 1988

the supreme court agreed today to hear a 
reagan administration appeal aimed at allowing some creditors to 
collect more money from debtors who declare bankruptcy 
the court said it will review a decision denying the 
governments claim for some interest payments on taxes owed by a 
bankrupt company 
the case stems from a reorganization petition filed by ron pair 
enterprises before a bankruptcy judge in detroit in 1984 
the government said the company owed it 53278 in taxes 
penalties and interest accrued prior to the filing of the 
bankruptcy petition 
the company agreed to pay the amount but refused to pay 
additional interest accrued after the bankruptcy filing 
the government said the company should pay the postfiling 
interest because the collateral tax liens on company property 
securing the debt owed the government exceeded the amount of the 
original debt 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals ruled against the 
government in september the appeals court said the bankruptcy 
code revised by congress in 1978 does not clearly provide for 
such payments they previously had been disallowed by courts 
justice department lawyers said the appeals court ruling could 
prove costly to the government 
they said the internal revenue service filed secured claims in 
bankruptcy proceedings totaling more than 730 million from 1982 
through 1986 including 186 million in 1986 alone 
the government lawyers said state and local governments and 
private creditors also are affected by the appeals court ruling 
the case is us vs ron pair 871043

general electric co today boosted its bid for 
roper corp to 507 million and filed lawsuits seeking to block 
roper from merging with whirlpool corp 
ge which sweetened its bid by 9 a share announced the new 
54ashare tender offer today 
the offer betters whirlpools second tender bid for roper made 
last week which amounts to 50 a share or about 470 million 
ges latest bid expires april 1 unless extended 
whirlpools initial 3750ashare offer prompted the bidding 
war for augusta gabased roper on march 6 ge entered the fray 
by offering to pay 45 a share for ropers 94 million outstanding 
shares 
after jumping 575 a share on friday roper stock had risen 
another 2625 a share on the new york stock exchange by midday 
ges lawsuit filed in delaware state court is the second wave 
of legal action in the battle for the augusta gabased appliance 
and lawn equipment maker 
on friday whirlpool filed suit charging that ge tried to 
sabotage the definitive merger agreement whirlpool reached with 
ropers board of directors last month 
moving aggressively ge today alleged that the roper board made 
no effort to test the price before agreeing to merge with 
whirlpool on feb 29 ge charged that roper concealed ges interest 
in the company when it advised shareholders to tender to whirlpool 
ge contends that it had expressed prior interest in acquiring 
roper and had asked to be informed if roper became available for 
acquisition 
the suit was filed against the roper board and names whirlpool 
as a defendant 
in a separate lawsuit filed in us district court in delaware 
ge charged that both whirlpool and roper failed to adequately 
disclose terms of their merger agreement under securities and 
exchange commission laws 
ge said in a statement earlier that it would vigorously defend 
itself against whirlpools charges that ge tried to sabotage 
the whirlpoolroper merger agreement ge seeks to transfer that 
suit from us district court in grand rapids mich to federal 
court in delaware 
in its lawsuit whirlpool charged that ge intentionally sought 
to block whirlpools merger with roper 
whirlpool alleged that the head of ges appliance business 
personally tried to persuade roper to break its contract with 
whirlpool the suit said ge intentionally maliciously and 
unjustifiedly engaged in a continuing course of conduct to 
sabotage the deal 
ge said in a statement today the suit grossly misstated the 
facts and was totally without legal merit ge noted that its 
offer was made directly to shareholders who are not bound by the 
acquisition agreement between whirlpool and the roper board 
whirlpool said its suit is similar in theory to pennzoil 
cos billiondollar legal battle with texaco inc over texacos 
acquisition of getty oil co texaco agreed to settle the suit for 
3 billion after pennzoil won a 103 billion judgment against the 
oil giant on charges that texaco prompted getty to back out of an 
agreement with pennzoil 
roper has been supportive of whirlpools efforts last week 
roper chief executive officer robert cook said the company has a 
strong desire to see this combination successfully completed 
analysts say a roperwhirlpool merger will move whirlpool ahead 
of ge as the nations leading appliance maker whirlpool has said 
it would expand roper from a maker of cooking ranges into a 
producer and marketer of a full line of appliances 
roper reported net income of 24 million on sales of 703 
million in fiscal 1987

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that makes it easier for investors to sue their brokers over the 
collapse in 1984 of a 3 billion oil and natural gas investment 
fund 
the court without comment rejected appeals by three brokerage 
firms seeking to force investors who lost money in the fund to sue 
individually rather than as a group 
the case stems from the collapse of the petrolewis fund in 
which some 180000 people purchased securities and limited 
partnerships from 1970 to 1984 the average initial investment by a 
limited partner was 8600 
petrolewis financial problems began when a supply glut caused 
oil and gas prices to plummet in the early 1980s 
the fund revealed in february 1984 that its condition was 
critical cutting partnership distribution by as much as 50 percent 
and selling up to onethird of its reserves 
that prompted numerous lawsuits against petrolewis and also 
against brokers who helped market the fund 
some investors settled with petrolewis which set up a 235 
million fund to handle the claims but that agreement did not 
preclude investors from suing their brokers 
the investors said the brokerage houses and individual brokers 
knowingly or recklessly participated with petrolewis in 
disseminating misleading information about the financial 
condition of the funds 
at issue in the case acted on today is whether the investors can 
maintain class action suits that permit them to apportion the 
costs of fighting the case and divide up any court award 
robinsonhumphrey co shearson lehman hutton inc and 
painewebber inc appealed a ruling by the 11th us circuit court 
of appeals in atlanta favoring the investors 
the appeals court said investors who claimed they were defrauded 
are arguing a common theory 
they allege that the petrolewis shares which were not traded 
on the open market could not have been marketed but for the 
defendants fraud the appeals court said 
the appeals court rejected the brokers argument that because 
investors relied on information given them orally by different 
brokers their claims should be tried separately 
the complaints alleged that the defendant brokerage firms and 
individual officers engaged in a common course of conduct to 
misrepresent the financial condition of petrolewis the 
appeals court said these claims involve common issues that 
clearly overwhelm the individual issues that may be present 
it would be repetitive wasteful and an unnecessary burden on 
the courts to require separate trials the appeals court added 
the cases are robinson humphrey vs sanders 87835 and 
painewebber vs parker 87836

with dainty womens underwear and frilly nightgowns 
prices are range from 24 for cotton dresses with front zippers 
to 16 for a twopiece jumpsuit 
the prices are reasonable weve been looking around and the 
prices here are better than a department store said jerry 
schultz of pine beach nj 
he and his wife jean were shopping for new clothes for his 
91yearold mother amelia schultz 
this is ideal he said we cant take mother out to the 
store and she should like what shes wearing 
silverthreads also will put on fashion shows at the request of 
nursing homes the shows are a boost for patients and staff alike 
said betty maxwell the recreation director at bartley manor 
its great they can try them on right afterwards she said 
as some residents and their families clustered around racks of 
dresses slacks and other items 
the misiaszeks say annual sales are a family secret they also 
say silverthreads provides more than a shopping service 
its really rewarding to see im making a difference it 
really has a lot of painful moments martin misiaszek said but 
i love it i wouldnt do anything else except win the lottery 
mrs molloy never found her lilac sneakers although there were 
plenty in other colors 
nooooo she said gotta be lilac 
she settled for a pair of pale yellow slacks then decided to 
browse a bit longer because i might find something else that 
strikes my fancy they have things here that we can really use

unionists at the beijing no 1 machine tool plant 
recently decided the factory manager had not been duly rewarded for 
his hard work and voted to increase his annual bonus 
that was one example boasted zheng lanjun head of the 
7200member union of how unions in socialist china strive to 
serve rather than confront the system 
but that cozy relationship under the firm guidance of the 
communist party is changing 
chinas bold economic reforms including giving factory bosses 
the authority to hire and fire workers have forced unions to 
redefine their role and even infused them with a touch of 
militancy 
with party approval unions are becoming more democratic less 
subservient to the party and more vocal on such issues as wages and 
worker safety 
the reforms have brought prosperity to the country and 
benefits to workers shen zuying spokesman for the allchina 
federation of trade unions said in an interview but they have 
also created new tasks for the unions as protectors of workers 
interests 
shen related how a union in wuhan central china recently 
fought back when the manager fired six workers for breaking factory 
rules it managed to get five reinstated he said 
in the northeast city of tianjin workers at a factory exercised 
their newfound power to oversee company operations by casting a 
noconfidence vote against the factory manager he was reassigned 
to the plants library 
the government has sanctioned a more assertive union movement to 
balance the growing power of factory managers under reforms that 
make industry more competitive and end lifetime employment 
guarantees 
beijing is giving factory heads greater freedom and 
responsibility over profits and losses and promoting job contracts 
that tie wages to performance few workers ever get fired but for 
the first time employees face discipline and possible dismissal 
for loafing on the job 
communist party chief zhao ziyang has called on unions to wake 
up to the new realities and play a greater supervisory role 
over the activities of their now powerful bosses 
for a long time trade unions were only involved in trifles 
distributing film tickets or relief aid to needy workers the 
official xinhua news agency said they played a small role in 
political issues 
that wasnt all the unions fault the allchina federation of 
trade unions made up of 15 union groupings with a membership of 90 
million or 90 percent of chinese factory workers dates back to 
1926 but since the communists came to power in 1949 and proclaimed 
the dictatorship of the proletariat the unions have been relegated 
to carrying out the party line on the factory floor 
in the 1950s unions were accused of syndicalism or trying 
to dominate the government and unions were disbanded during the 
ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution 
the right of workers to strike was deleted from the 1982 
constitution 
the leaders didnt think it was necessary said the acftus 
shen we are socialists and the countrys interests and those of 
workers are the same 
he added however that strikes are not illegal and that if a 
strike is found to be justified we should support it such 
cases he said have been very rare 
instead unions are focusing on gaining a greater say in factory 
decisions 
workers in many plants nominate and elect their union 
representatives called workers congresses the congresses or 
their leaders must in turn be consulted by the factory manager 
before major decisions are made particularly on personnel matters 
party officials are supposed to let the unions run their own 
daytoday affairs although they still hold seats on union 
committees and are expected to guide the ideological thinking of 
workers 
in the past the party interfered too much in our 
activities shen said 
the union at the beijing no 1 machine tool plant besides 
organizing badminton tournaments and calligraphy classes is 
increasingly called on to mediate worker disputes zheng said 
he related how the union was the arbiter when a woman caught 
stealing was fired and when a man who lost both legs in an 
accident was unhappy with managements compensation of a new 
apartment television and refrigerator in both cases the union 
came down on the side of management 
but the union also has demanded that the factory do something 
about its unsanitary dining hall and is pushing for the factory to 
provide physical examinations more frequently than the current once 
every four years 
the trade union should support the director in exercising his 
rights and at the same time protect the rights of workers zheng 
said 
the acftus monopoly over organized labor is not likely to 
change in 1981 some young people tried to establish independent 
unions modeled after polands solidarity but they were quickly 
suppressed 
although union membership is technically voluntary almost 
everybody joins zheng said the 100 nonunion workers in the 
7300worker plant are new employees who havent put their 
applications in yet 
but the acftus shen noted that the reforms also have created 20 
million private businessmen and 80 million workers in small rural 
factories who are largely unorganized these groups he said may 
be the union movements next big challenge

bell resources ltd on monday withdrew its takeover 
offer for bell group ltd following a bid for bell resources by two 
investors 
the investors sir ronald brierleys industrial equity ltd and 
kerry packers consolidated press holdings ltd are jointly 
offering 900 million australian dollars the equivalent of 665 
million for bell resources 
their offer made last thursday was conditioned on bell 
resources ending its offer for bell group the companies are the 
main listed concerns operated by australian financier robert holmes 
a court 
bell resources said the takeover offer was a material change 
in circumstances that should be considered by the company and its 
shareholders although bell resources considered the price 
inadequate 
brierley and packer were offering 150 australian dollars a 
share for bell resources the companys stock closed at 157 
australian dollars in trading in sydney monday indicating the 
market expects the bid to be raised 
on feb 29 bell resources offered one of its own shares plus 1 
australian dollar cash for each bell group share 
the bid was seen by many analysts as a move to simplify holmes a 
courts corporate structure after the october stock market crash 
to put togther bell resources cash and investments with bell 
groups industrial operations and therefore to reduce bell groups 
heavy borrowings 
the move would give holmes a court cash he owns 45 percent of 
bell group which in owns about 40 percent of bell resources 
the takeover bid was criticized as too generous for bell group 
shares and so to the disadvantage of bell resources shareholders

investment in plant and equipment by us 
business is likely to increase about 88 percent this year but only 
05 percent in 1989 according to a survey released monday 
manufacturers are likely to lead the way this year with a 125 
percent increase in investment but trail in 1989 with a 29 
percent decrease data resources inc of lexington mass said 
the larger nonmanufacturing sector is expected to be more 
stable with a 66 percent increase this year and a 27 percent 
increase in 1989 the survey said based on answers from 457 
companies 
companies were more optimistic about 1988 than in a previous 
survey conducted just before the october stock market crash when 
they predicted overall investment in plant and equipment would rise 
62 percent according to data resources a unit of mcgrawhill inc 
many economists say the stock market crash cooled off the 
economy at a time when it was in danger of overheating and falling 
into recession some are now pushing back the date of an expected 
recession to 1989

kelso amp co expects to decide by the end of this 
month whether to sweeten its 25 billion tender offer for american 
standard inc to fend off rival bidder black amp decker corp 
according to a report published monday 
american standard a new yorkbased plumbing and air 
conditioning company on thursday accepted kelsos 78ashare 
offer but the following day black amp decker raised its bid for 
american standard to 77 a share from 73 
the kelso offer began monday and was scheduled to expire at 
1201 am est april 1 black amp decker extended its offer to expire 
on the same day 
despite the fact that kelsos bid is about 30 million higher 
black amp decker has maintained that its proposal is better in 
light of the timing and probability of payment 
black amp decker a towson mdbased tool and appliance maker is 
hoping to benefit from nervous arbitrageurs who hold a majority of 
american standards stock and worry that kelso might not be able to 
come up with the financing to complete the transaction 
tendering their shares to black amp decker still would ensure a 
premium price for american standards stock which by late 
afternoon monday traded at 7650 a share up 875 cents on the 
new york stock exchange 
kelso however said it was willing to raise its bid to win over 
shareholders according to mondays editions of the wall street 
journal 
we didnt come this far to be deterred by this kind of 
response joseph schuchert kelsos managing partner told the 
newspaper well tender at 78 and see what they do if its 
necessary to bump our tender offer thats what well do 
he said kelso was unlikely to act until march 31 
kelso officials did not return numerous telephone calls from the 
associated press on monday 
kelso specializes in leveraged buyouts involving employee stock 
ownership plans or esops a concept it pioneered about 30 years 
ago 
in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely through 
borrowed money repaid from the target companys profits or sale of 
assets esops also are financed mostly with borrowed funds but 
equity is divided among all of the companys workers not just a 
few investors 
kelso said it planned to finance the american standard 
acquisition through a 250 million investment and several bank 
loans

reflected another dose of postcrash anxiety and falling prices in 
the bond market a warning signal of higher interest rates 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which hit the highest

the 2100point barrier fell 2189 points to 206548 by 3 pm on

prices in the bond market a sensitive barometer of inflation and

the supreme court agreed monday in a case 
brought by phone customers in minnesota to consider making it 
easier for people to use a federal antiracketeering law to sue 
businesses 
the court also agreed to hear a reagan administration appeal 
aimed at allowing some creditors to collect more money from debtors 
who declare bankruptcy 
the justices also agreed to study the case of a laidoff 
pennsylvania man in a matter that could decide an important issue 
for lawsuits alleging age bias in employment 
in another case the court refused to let states and local 
governments regulate the prices which most of the nations cable 
television operators charge for basic service 
in the antiracketeering case the court said it will hear an 
appeal by phone customers in minnesota who have accused 
northwestern bell telephone co of trying to bribe state public 
utility officials 
the phone subcribers sued the company under a law known as the 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
they said the company beginning in 1980 tried illegally to win 
rate increases by offering gifts employment offers tickets to 
sporting and cultural events and other favors to members of the 
minnesota public utilities commission 
the suit was thrown out by a federal judge and that ruling was 
upheld last september by the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court said the phone users failed to allege a 
continuing pattern of racketeering activity required to make a case 
under the rico act 
the supreme court is being asked to choose among various 
theories of how difficult it should be to maintain such a lawsuit 
in the bankruptcy case the court said it will review a decision 
denying the governments claim for some interest payments on taxes 
owed by a bankrupt company 
the case stems from a reorganization petition filed by ron pair 
enterprises before a bankruptcy judge in detroit in 1984 
the government said the company owed 53278 in taxes penalties 
and interest accrued prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition 
the company agreed to pay the amount but refused to pay 
additional interest accrued after the bankruptcy filing 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals ruled against the 
government in september justice department lawyers said the 
appeals court ruling could prove costly to the government 
in the age discrimination case the justices agreed to decide 
whether eugene f briecks lawsuit against his former employer 
harbisonwalker refractories should proceed to a jury trial 
in july 1982 several employees of harbisonwalkers iron and 
steel marketing support group were laid off including brieck he 
then was 55 
brieck sued harbisonwalker in pittsburgh in 1984 contending 
that he was laid off and not recalled to work because of his age 
us district judge gerald j weber threw out briecks suit but 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals reinstated briecks suit last 
june 19 
in the cable tv case the court without comment rejected 
arguments that the deregulation effected in 1986 by congress and 
the federal communications commission left subscribers vulnerable 
to illegal monopoly pricing 
most of the nations 7800 cable tv operators provide both basic 
and premium services for an extra monthly fee subscribers 
receive channels offering exclusive sports and movie programming 
prior to 1984 the fcc allowed local communities to regulate the 
rates charged for basic cable service but not for premium service 
rates 
congress in 1984 enacted the cable communications policy act 
which lets local authorities regulate basic cable rates only in the 
absence of effective competition 
defining effective competition was left up to the fcc and 
the commissions definition paved the way for the deregulation of 
basicservice rates charged by more than 90 percent of all cable 
operators 
the appeal acted on monday was filed by lawyers for connecticut 
new york city the national league of cities and the american civil 
liberties union 
lawyers for the commission and the cable operators association 
urged the justices to reject the appeal 
in other cases the court 
agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law designed to 
promote competitive bidding on government contracts at issue is 
the proper boundary between presidential and congressional power 
refused to let the dalkon shields maker set up a 15 million 
emergency fund to help women who say the contraceptive device left 
them infertile the court without comment let stand a ruling that 
blocks creation of the fund pending the outcome of bankruptcy 
proceedings for ah robins co inc which manufactures the device 
agreed to decide whether an airline may be forced to reinstate 
workers when their strike ends making necessary the layoffs of 
trainees and employees who crossed the picket lines the court said 
it will study an appeal by trans world airlines in a dispute 
stemming from a 1986 strike by flight attendants 
let stand a ruling that makes it easier for investors to sue 
their brokers over the collapse in 1984 of a 3 billion oil and 
natural gas investment fund 
agreed to decide in a case from texas whether states may impose 
sales taxes on most books newspapers and magazines while exempting

general electric co launched a doublepronged 
attack monday in its bid for roper corp by boosting its tender 
offer to 507 million and filing lawsuits challenging ropers 
agreement to merge with whirlpool corp 
ges latest bid up 9 a share to 54 for ropers outstanding 
stock surpasses the 50ashare sweetened bid whirlpool made last 
week for the appliance and lawn equipment maker 
in the second wave of lawsuits filed in the hotly contested bid 
for augusta gabased roper ge charged that ropers board failed 
to act in the best interest of shareholders and together with 
whirlpool violated federal disclosure laws 
in a statement issued after the stock market closed roper said 
it is reviewing ges new tender offer and plans to hold a board 
meeting later in the week to determine the companys position on 
the sweetened bid 
roper rose 250 a share in composite new york stock exchange 
trading to close at 5550 a share roper jumped 575 a share on 
friday 
ges two lawsuits filed in separate courts in delaware counter 
a suit filed friday in which whirlpool accused ge of trying to 
sabotage the definitive merger agreement whirlpool reached with 
ropers board of directors on feb 29 
ge said in court papers it contacted robert cook ropers 
president and chief executive officer about a possible acquisition 
in november but was turned down 
three months later ropers board authorized a 3750ashare 
merger with whirlpool after whirlpool threatened to mount a hostile 
takeover bid papers filed in delaware state court showed 
ge which entered into the fray march 6 with a 45ashare 
offer charged that roper failed to test the price before 
agreeing to merge with whirlpool ge also charged that roper 
concealed ges interest in the company when it advised shareholders 
to tender to whirlpool 
in an attempt to lock up its agreement with whirlpool roper 
gave the benton harbor michbased company an option to purchase 
16 million newly issued shares for 3750 if the deal fell 
through a move ge charged would make any subsequent roper 
acquisition more expensive ge is seeking to block the issue and 
transfer of those shares 
in a separate suit filed in us district court in delaware ge 
charged that both whirlpool and roper failed to adequately disclose 
terms of their merger agreement under securities and exchange 
commission laws and neglected to mention ges interest in roper 
whirlpool which threw the battle into the courtroom on friday 
alleged in its suit that a ge executive personally tried to 
persuade roper to break its contract with whirlpool the suit said 
ge intentionally maliciously and unjustifiedly engaged in a 
continuing course of conduct to sabotage the deal 
part of whirlpools lawsuit seeks 117 million in damages or 
the difference between its 50ashare offer and original offer 
ge vowed to vigorously defend itself against the charges and 
seeks to transfer the suit from us district court in grand 
rapids mich to federal court in delaware 
whirlpool said its suit is similar in theory to pennzoil 
cos legal battle with texaco inc over texacos acquisition of 
getty oil co 
texaco agreed to settle the suit for 3 billion after pennzoil 
won a 103 billion judgment against the oil giant on charges that 
texaco prompted getty to back out of an agreement with pennzoil 
roper has been supportive of whirlpools efforts in endorsing 
whirlpools sweetened bid last week ropers cook said the company 
has a strong desire to see this combination successfully 
completed he had no further comment when contacted monday 
analysts say a roperwhirlpool merger would move whirlpool ahead 
of ge as the nations leading appliance maker whirlpool has said 
it would expand roper from a maker of cooking ranges into a 
producer and marketer of a full line of appliances 
but the acquisition of roper would help ge secure its position 
in the gas stove market and enhance its supplier relationship with 
sears roebuck amp co 
long limited to electric ranges ge decided a year ago to widen 
its market share by selling gas stoves since then ge has purchased 
gas stoves from four companies including roper said ge spokesman 
jack batty from the companys headquarters in fairfield conn 
in addition analysts estimate that roughly twothirds of 
ropers sales come from its agreement to supply sears with its 
kitchen appliance and lawn equipment products 
roper reported net income of 24 million on sales of 703 
million in fiscal 1987

stocks for more than a short time reflected an underlying anxiety 
that has persisted since the october collapse

platinum futures prices surged above 500 a troy ounce monday 
helped by early gains in oil prices and a generally positive 
economic outlook 
oil prices settled mixed however on other markets gold and 
silver futures advanced soybean futures were sharply higher while 
the grains were mixed livestock and meat futures were mixed and 
stockindex futures retreated 
the contract for april delivery of platinum settled 690 higher 
at 50420 on the new york mercantile exchange the move marked 
only the second time since jan 20 that the april platinum contract 
has finished above the psychologically important 500 barrier 
analysts said gains monday in all the precious metals 
platinum gold silver and palladium were driven primarily by a 
sharp increase in crude oil futures prices early in the day 
but when oil prices later fell steeply the metals gave up only 
some of their gains indicating other supportive factors were at 
work 
the weak dollar increased us auto sales and the generally 
positive tone of recent economic data are all bullish for metals 
prices said jacques luben executive director of investments for 
the platinum guild international 
it seems as though the consensus is that interest rates will 
remain relatively low for the remainder of the year we may see 
higher inflation and we probably wont see a recession this year 
luben said 
mondays performance was a reassuring vote of confidence for 
the metals but the next few sessions will show just how deep that 
confidence runs said jack barbanel director of futures trading 
for gruntal amp co in new york 
were either at the early stage of some new buying momentum or 
were seeing an upside correction in a downside metals market he 
said 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 490 to 720 
higher with april at 44920 a troy ounce silver was 8 cents to 
103 cents higher with march at 6447 a troy ounce 
crude oils early jump above 17 a barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange was triggered partly by speculation that opec 
president rilwanu lukman would announce a meeting of opecs pricing 
committee at a tuesday news conference said nauman barakat an 
analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
but prices came tumbling down later in the session when saudi 
arabias king fahd confirmed the country was offering discounts 
quite indiscriminately to almost everybody barakat said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents lower to 8 
cents higher with april at 1649 a barrel heating oil was 12 
cent lower to 35 cent higher with april at 4540 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was unchanged to 12 cent higher with april at 
4611 cents a gallon 
soybean and corn futures settled sharply higher on the chicago 
board of trade while wheat prices fell 
soybean futures rose early in the session on rumors of new 
soviet buying and got a boost later in the day when the 
agricultural newsletter safras y mercado dropped its brazilian 
soybean crop estimate by 400000 metric tons due to dry weather 
said victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter reynolds inc 
wheat settled 2 cents lower to cent higher with march at 
296 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with march at 
201 a bushel oats were 5 cents lower to cent higher with 
march at 190 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents to 10 cents higher 
with march at 630 a bushel 
frozen pork belly futures settled sharply lower on the chicago 
mercantile exchange while livestock futures were mixed 
the drop in pork belly futures was largely due to expectations 
later confirmed of a sharp increase in bellies in cold storage 
the usda announced after the close that nearly 67 million pounds of 
pork bellies were stored in the nations freezers on feb 29 
compared to 347 million pounds a year ago 
sharply lower cash hog prices weighed on the livestock futures 
said walter kowalski an analyst in chicago with lindwaldock amp co 
live cattle settled 12 cent lower to 50 cent higher with april 
at 7365 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 10 
cent higher with march at 8270 cents a pound hogs were 65 cent 
lower to 10 cent higher with april at 4555 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were unchanged to 170 cents lower with march at 5410 
cents a pound 
stockindex futures retreated on the chicago mercantile 
exchange where the contract for june delivery of the standard amp

batus inc took its campaign for farmers 
group inc to the companys shareholders monday soliciting proxies 
to support reconsideration of its bid for one of the nations 
largest insurers 
batus said the nonbinding resolution will be introduced at 
farmers annual stockholders meeting may 20 at the companys los 
angeles headquarters 
on march 10 farmers board unanimously rejected a hostile 
takeover offer of 63 a share or 44 billion and called upon its 
shareholders to do the same the offer was described as being 
substantially less than the company is worth 
the board which has refused to enter into negotiations also 
announced it was exploring a variety of alternatives to the batus 
bid including restructuring or consolidating with another company 
farmers said it has had discussions with an unidentified third 
party about a possible leveraged buyout to counter the offer from 
batus the us subsidiary of british bat industries plc 
farmers group shares fell to 6250 down 112 in active 
overthecounter trading monday 
in seeking the proxies batus said its resolution would give 
stockholders an opportunity to express their support for the 
merger at no less than 63 a share and would encourage the 
directors to pursue such a sale 
in case a higher bidder emerged the resolution recommends that 
farmers directors consider in good faith whether to negotiate 
with such a bidder 
batus latest maneuver was no surprise said tom welch 
director of corporate investments for farmers we have been 
expecting it he declined further comment 
batus spokesman wilson wyatt jr said the solicitation was being 
handled by the carter organization in new york 
wyatt also said batus does not intend to oppose or take any 
position with respect to the election of farmers nominees to the 
board 
wyatt said that batus based in louisville owns 696000 shares 
of farmers stock of which there were 68916614 shares 
outstanding as of oct 31 1987 
earlier this month a federal judge in nevada ordered farmers to 
place batus negotiation proposal in the proxy cards being sent to 
shareholders for the meeting 
the case was heard in nevada because farmers is incorporated 
there 
batus which owns a diversified group of businesses including 
retailers saks fifth avenue and marshall fields began the bidding 
in january with a 60 per share offer for farmers 
farmers is the nations thirdlargest home and auto insurer 
after state farm and allstate and the seventhlargest property and 
casualty insurer 
some analysts have said batus needs to raise its offer by 5 to 
20 a share if it expects to acquire farmers which has about 11 
billion in assets mostly in insurance 
the wall street journal reported monday that state insurance 
regulators and legislators had raised questions that could hinder 
the batus bid 
officials of the texas state board of insurance have questioned 
the companys ability to service the debt required to accomplish 
the deal 
in ohio the state house of representatives has approved a 
resolution expressing its concern about how the takeover might 
affect farmers policyholders and employees in that state 
a spokesman for batus british parent told the journal that it 
was responding to the questions from the texas authorities and 
believes it meets all the legal requirements to control insurance 
companies in texas and ohio 
before its purchase of farmers can be completed batus must get 
approval from insurance regulators in nine states regulators in 
several states including idaho illinois and kansas have asked 
the company for more information the journal said

an investment group that owns an 11 percent 
stake in kansas city southern industries inc said monday it was 
offering 60 a share or about 594 million for the rest of the 
railroad concerns common stock 
kansas city southern which also has interests in financial 
services said its board would consider the allcash proposal soon 
at a special meeting 
the company has nearly 111 million shares outstanding and the 
investment group led by howard kaskel claims it controls about 12 
million shares 
in trading on the new york stock exchange kansas city southern 
jumped 875 a share to 55 
kaskel outlined the merger proposal in a letter to landon h 
rowland president and chief executive of kansas city southern and 
requested an opportunity to negotiate all aspects of the offer 
including price 
he said completing the proposal was subject to reaching a 
definitive agreement approval by the requisite number of directors 
and stockholders and satisfaction of all regulatory requirements 
but he warned that if the companys board rejected or failed to 
act on the offer by april 4 we will be forced to commence a 
proxy contest to elect directors who will actively pursue and 
encourage the maximization of stockholder values 
kaskel said he had made various proposals to company management 
over the past eight months on ways to maximize shareholder values 
unfortunately you have rejected each of my suggestions 
kaskel wrote 
in addition he said he found it dismaying that the board 
erected obstacles designed to entrench itself and to prevent 
stockholders from realizing a full return on their investment 
among these steps kaskel cited the recent issuance of about 14 
million shares or almost 15 percent of the companys 
thenoutstanding common stock to employee stock ownership plans at 
49 a share 
this could only have been motivated by the boards desire to 
place substantial voting power in its hands as a means of 
opposing proposals that may be brought before its shareholders 
the letter said 
kaskel also cited kansas city southerns continued efforts to 
acquire the southern pacific railroad despite southern pacifics 
binding agreement for its sale to the denver rio grande 
responding to the offer rowland said in a statement from 
company headquarters in kansas city that the company had received a 
merger proposal from kaskel and that it would be considered by the 
companys board at a special meeting to be held shortly 
he said the company would have no further comment until the 
board of directors had an opportunity to study the proposal 
kansas city southern owns the kansas city southern railroad 
which operates on about 1500 miles of track in missouri arkansas 
oklahoma kansas louisiana and texas 
it also owns 87 percent of dst systems inc a kansas citybased 
concern that provides data systems and recordkeeping services for

the federal government chalked up a 239 billion deficit in its 
february spending after posting a rare budget surplus in january 
the treasury department reported monday 
meanwhile stock prices fell in the slowest trading of the year 
while the dollar followed suit and oil prices were mixed 
the treasurys latest monthly report on the governments 
spending and revenues followed a 161 billion surplus in january 
which had occurred because social security checks that month were 
mailed early and counted in the december spending figures 
so far this fiscal year the government has run up a fivemonth 
deficit of 897 billion 49 percent lower than the red ink 
incurred in the same period a year earlier 
the reagan administration is projecting a deficit of 1467 
billion for the fiscal year ending sept 30 down 24 percent from 
the 1504 billion deficit in 1987 
but many forecasters believe the small improvement will not be 
realized because they think the administration has used overly 
optimistic projections about the economy 
on wall street inflation fears and lingering postcrash anxiety 
sent stocks tumbling across the board with the dow jones average 
of 30 industrials dropping sharply at the opening and remaining 
down throughout the trading session 
the closely watched indicator closed at 206714 down 2023 
points broader market indices also fell 
trading was also quiet on world currency markets the dollar 
fell against all major currencies except the canadian dollar 
mirroring the stock market selloff and a decline in bond prices 
gold prices jumped as much as 5 a troy ounce in active trading 
spurred by a rally in oil prices republic national bank of new 
york quoted a bid price for gold of 44945 a troy ounce as of 4 
pm est up from 444 an ounce late friday 
gold prices moved in concert with crude oil futures prices 
which pierced the 17abarrel level before sliding back in late 
trading following a statement by saudi king fahd on prices and 
production 
in remarks carried by the official saudi press agency fahd 
suggested that cheating on production quotas and prices by some 
members of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries encouraged further weakness in prices 
that punctured a rally on the new york mercantile exchange
