japans newly appointed justice minister resigned 
friday under a barrage of criticism for accepting political 
donations from a company at the center of a major scandal 
there is nothing wrong with politicians accepting donations 
made from the good will of their supporters takashi hasegawa told 
reporters at the justice ministry however as minister in charge 
of clearing up the recruit problem in the takeshita administration 
which is trying to heighten trust in government it is regrettable 
that i received donations from recruit 
i apologize deeply and resign from my post as justice 
minister 
kyodo news service said prime minister noboru takeshita accepted 
the resignation just tuesday takeshita chose hasegawa to handle a 
probe of a stockprofiteering scandal involving influential 
politicians and business leaders and the recruit co 
the secretary general of takeshitas liberal democratic party 
shintaro abe said the administration may look outside government to 
replace hasegawa he said a new minister probably would be named 
before the weekend 
takeshita reshuffled his cabinet on tuesday in a move to rid his 
administration of any links to the scandal involving the purchase of 
unlisted stocks by a select number of individuals 
on thursday takeshita told chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi 
to look into the history of other new cabinet members ties to 
recruit co an information and publishing conglomerate at the 
center of the scandal 
kyodo said obuchi also accepted donations from recruit two other 
new cabinet members have acknowledged that recruit bought tickets 
for their fundraising parties 
opposition party leaders had demanded takeshita fire hasegawa and 
said the prime minister should take responsibility for appointing 
hasegawa without checking whether he had ties with recruit 
appointing a person related to the recruit scandal as justice 
minister who is in charge of investigation into the scandal is out 
of the question it is not something they can get away by saying 
they did not know said mitsuhiro kaneko head of the japan 
communist partys secretariat 
influential politicians and business leaders were offered 
bargainpriced shares in recruitcosmos a recruit real estate 
subsidiary before they were listed for public sale share prices 
rose sharply after their public offering and some shareholders made 
more than 80000 in taxfree profits 
former finance minister kiichi miyazawa heads the roster of 17 
politicians and business leaders who resigned earlier in the 
scandal a former recruit official pleaded guilty to trying to bribe 
an opposition parliament member to tone down his investigation 
but hasegawas and obuchis reported links with recruit differed 
from the other cases 
the day after hasegawas appointment it was disclosed that his 
political support organization received 46000 in membership dues 
from recruit over 12 years the latest donation of 3800 came in 
october about three months after the recruit scandal erupted 
on thursday takeshita said hasegawa told him that accepting 
membership fees from recruit lacked prudence and i fully agree 
with him but takeshita added i believe his ability will allow 
him to fulfill his responsibility as justice minister 
the prime minister said earlier hasegawa would play a key role in 
promoting reform in political ethics and that hasegawa was the best 
man for the job 
hasegawa 76 told a news conference thursday he was truly 
careless in not knowing about the donations but as justice 
minister i dont think this matter will be an impediment 
hasegawa first denied allegations about the donations and then 
said they were made without his knowledge but his son and 
secretary akira hasegawa said he told his father about the 
donations as early as october 
in forming his new cabinet on tuesday takeshita sought to put 
the recruit scandal behind him 
but critics link takeshita himself to the scandal since one of 
his aides profited from sales of bargain recruit shares the prime 
minister has denied any personal involvement 
kyodo said obuchis support organization has been receiving 160 
a month from recruit although it was not known for how long 
it said obuchis only comment was we have been complying with 
the law in handling political donations 
tsutomu hata the new agriculture minister acknowledged that 
recruit bought tickets for his fundraising party in 1986 but did 
not disclose the amount 
another new cabinet official ken harada director general of the 
economic planning agency acknowledged he received donations from 
recruit for more than 10 years and that recruit has bought tickets 
for his fundraising parties 
like the stock transactions the political donations were legal 
but critics contend the stock deals were unethical and were 
donations in disguise 
tsuruo yamaguchi general secretary of the largest opposition 
party the socialists had demanded hasegawas resignation

ignore the wheelchair and arthritis 
her 80 years weigh lightly upon the mind and wit of mfk fisher 
whose gifts to the world of food and literature are still mounting 
but shed a tear for the grand dame of gastronomy mary frances 
kennedy fisher denies herself the pleasure she gives her army of 
admirers in the 17 books and scores of magazine pieces that for 50 
years set a lean and spicy standard few can match 
i never read anything ive written she snapped i dont 
care to go back i never read a word of print about me or by me 
she wouldnt argue with going back to being able to use her hands 
for typing fate has ruled that she must dictate into a tape 
recorder theres no question of her not doing it writing is as 
important to her as air 
i am compulsive about it admitted the michiganborn author 
who wrote such tasty morsels as how to cook a wolf the 
gastronomical me consider the oyster and her pungent 
alphabet for gourmets 
chafing among cushions in her little winecountry house she 
added but its like pulling teeth its just awful i cant 
dictate to a person so i dictate secretly i dont make many 
mistakes you know its my newspaper training i dont have any 
errors once i get it down on paper thank god 
in 1937 the worlds food writers discovered a tough new kid on 
the block when they eyed this paragraph leaping from the pages of 
serve it forth mary frances first book 
the quails are an artful lure to the most refined of palates 
and the rabbit stew steaming aromatic is made just as tempting 
with an onion or two pepper freshly ground a little bacon and a 
dash of cheap pure wine 
a somewhat less literate reporter observed its a shame you 
dont get to read your good stuff like that she was not 
impressed others are it was once said of her crisp prose 
she writes about food as others do about love but rather 
better fisher writes not as a specialist but as a whole human 
being spiky with prejudices charming shorttempered 
welltraveled and cosmopolitan she is a person not a gourmet 
masked as a writer her passion comes from inside her 
that was 35 years ago except for such indignities as two hip 
replacements a corneal implant and the arthritis nothing has 
changed and she remembers everything between times three 
husbands magazine pieces the books that never made me any 
money the travels in europe 
of all her mates said mary frances my real husband was jimmy 
parrish dillwyn parrish they lived in a stone house surrounded 
by a vineyard and garden in vevey switzerland 
it was there she said that she learned from her italian swiss 
neighbors to cook vegetables in their own juices with sweet butter 
or thick olive oil to encourage them a little tomatoes and onions 
and sweet peppers and all the summer things 
she credits her start in foodwriting on an episode during 
prohibition when she was living in whittier calif and her 
newspaperman father rex kennedy was teaching at a nearby college 
she was working in a postcard shop one afternoon she had a halfday 
off and decided to go the public library where she found an 
elizabethan cookbook on a table 
it smelled so good the binding i started writing she 
said 
she showed her writing to alfred fisher the man who became her 
first husband she had just turned 21 when they married and 11 days 
later they set off to france and three years in dijon where he got 
his doctorate and she earned a degree at the university of dijon 
back in the states her writing started making the rounds at 26 
she sold her first magazine story the standing and the waiting 
and it conjured visions full of verbs and wide swaths of color the 
most scholarly of her work is her translation of legendary 
gastronomer jean anthelme brillatsavarins the physiology of 
taste her favorite work 
smoothing her red polkadot dress she peered out the window of 
the small busy house she has lived in for 18 years craning to see 
who was coming to visit her next they come all day long for a few 
moments in her youthful presence they come professionally or as 
friends for interviews a publishers conference a chat advice or 
perhaps to drop off a particularly nice piece of cheese or share a 
plateful of the chincoteague oysters she loves so much 
she calls her visitors strays and wayfarers they sit with 
her near a large picture window in her sonoma county house on the 
edge of the old bouverie ranch in jack london country 
but in her eighth decade mary frances is not overwhelmed with 
the way things have gone with the world 
were suicidal declared the mother of two daughters our 
doom is sealed i take a very dim view of us as a human race the 
only one that kills itself and everything around it weve 
poisoned the earth and the land and the water what else is there to 
poison i dont have any hope for us at all 
we looked out on her green meadow rolling to the trees 
peaceful and the harsh pronouncement seemed a long way away

mother and daughter were entombed in 
eternal night and their only food a jar of jam was gone tons of 
smashed concrete around them had become their prison mommy im 
so thirsty i want to drink cried the 4yearold girl 
susanna petrosyan said she was trapped flat on her back a 
prefabricated concrete panel 18 inches above her head and a crumpled 
water pipe above her shoulders kept her from standing she wore only 
a slip and it was horribly cold 
beside her in the darkness lay the lifeless body of her 
sisterinlaw karine she had been crushed by falling walls and 
died pinned beneath rubble one day after the dec 7 earthquake 
leveled much of leninakan and other towns in northwestern armenia 
mommy i need to drink sobbed mrs petrosyans daughter 
gayaney please give me something 
i thought my child was going to die of thirst mrs 
petrosyan 26 recalled i had no water no fruit juice no 
liquids it was then i remembered that i had my own blood 
although she was trapped in darkness she could slide on her back 
from side to side her groping fingers numb from the cold found a 
shattered glass she sliced open her left index finger with a shard 
and gave it to her daughter to suckle 
the drops of blood werent enough please mommy some more 
cut another finger mrs petrosyan remembers her daughter saying 
the woman made more cuts in her flesh feeling nothing because of 
the bitter cold she put her hand to her childs mouth squeezing 
her fingers to make more blood come 
i knew i was going to die mrs petrosyan said but i 
wanted my daughter to live 
many stories of courage have emerged from the earthquake in 
armenia but few if any are as touching or harrowing as the tale 
susanna petrosyan told this week in a soft voice from her yerevan 
hospital bed 
around 1130 am on the day of the quake she said the two were 
driven by mrs petrosyans husband gerkham a shoemaker to the 
apartment building on leninakans kamo street where karine lived 
mrs petrosyan a petite woman with thick black hair and curving 
eyebrows wanted to try on a black dress with puffed shoulders that 
karine had for sale 
it fit her perfectly as she took it off at 1141 am the 
fifthfloor apartment began to tremble then shake violently 
dressed only in a slip and her underwear she grabbed gayaney 
wearing a heavy winter sweater and ran to the door then the floor 
opened up and the 36unit building collapsed 
the three fell into the basement with the ninestory building 
crumbling around them 
although trapped on her back mrs petrosyan found a 1pound jar 
of blackberry jam that had fallen to the basement from karines 
pantry on the second day of their captivity the day karine died 
of her injuries she gave the entire jar to gayaney to eat 
mrs petrosyan said she found a skirt perhaps the one she had 
tried on and made a bed for gayaney to lie on despite the bitter 
cold she took off her stockings and wrapped them around her 
daughter to keep her warm

as the days passed and gayaneys pleas for something to drink 
become more pressing her mother remembered something she had seen 
on television 
it was a program about an explorer in the arctic who was dying 
of thirst his comrade slashed open his hand and gave his friend his 
blood she said 
losing track of time because of the unchanging darkness mrs 
petrosyan doesnt know what day she cut open her fingers or how 
many times she used the method to feed her daughter 
her thoughts wandered she saw scenes of her life pass before her 
eyes and she hallucinated 
when i closed my eyes and opened them again i could see boxes 
full of apples and bottles of lemonade mrs petrosyan recalled 
i told my daughter my child there are so many things to eat and 
drink but when i reached out to touch them they were gone 
gayaney cried that she wanted to go home i want to be back in 
my bed again and see my daddy she said 
i lost all hope the mother said i was just waiting for 
death 
on dec 14 the eighth day of their captivity rescue workers 
opened a small hole that let in a shaft of light were saved 
mrs petrosyan cried 
theres a child in here be careful not to hurt her she 
screamed as they got closer 
her husband a shoemaker was uninjured by the quake he was with 
the rescuers and the two tearfully embraced mrs petrosyan was 
placed on a stretcher 
mother and daughter were flown to yerevan armenias capital 60 
miles away gayaney was taken to childrens hospital no 3 mrs 
petrosyan to the armenian national hospital 
gayaney was in intensive care for four days hooked up to 
intravenous bottles that dripped liquids into her parched body 
her temperature was dangerously low her blood alarmingly thick 
and she was in shock said dr silva nersesyan her physician the 
girl also was in a deep state of depression and wouldnt talk or 
smile 
mrs petroysan also dehydrated was given intravenous fluids and 
placed in a coffinlike box so that pressurized oxygen could be 
pumped around her as a treatment against exposure 
it was then that doctors discovered that the woman who also has 
a 7yearold son who was not hurt in the earthquake is two months 
pregnant 
doctors say both mother and daughter could be released from their 
hospitals in as little as a week but differ about whether mrs 
petrosyans blood helped keep gayaney alive 
for a child the concentration of liquids in the body is much 
more important than for an adult nersesyan said for gayaney 
her mothers blood played an important perhaps decisive role 
dr ripsime parsadanyan who treated mrs petrosyan disagrees 
susanna lost a very little even insignificant amount of blood 
what saved them was that they were together the mother didnt have 
time to panic she had to think of her child 
gayaney is still weak and has a light case of pneumonia but the 
girl with the big dark eyes has started to talk again and to smile 
in her hospital bed she strings colored yarn through cardboard 
dolls and plays with a teddy bear christmas gifts that jeb bush 
the son of presidentelect george bush gave her when he visited the 
hospital sunday 
gayaney is too young to understand what happened to her the day 
she was buried alive 
bad people pulled down the house where we were and we couldnt 
get out she said i wanted my father to come and defend us from 
those bad people but he didnt come not for a long time

as china enjoys a marked thaw in restrictions on 
cultural debate an intense voluble man with no political stature 
and little fame has launched a oneman crusade to open up debate on 
democracy and communist rule 
sexual themes now can be portrayed on canvas and the screen and 
economists can question the wisdom of state ownership of factories 
but suggestions for limits to the communist partys power are an 
invitation for arrest 
ren wanding a thin shaggyhaired accountant who rarely laughs 
knows it 
he spent 197983 in prison for having advocated multiparty 
democracy and after a long silence renewed his call last month with 
an open letter to the un human rights commission and a 22page 
essay on freedom 
this week he began distributing among foreign journalists four 
new essays denouncing the ruling communist party as a narrowminded 
bully and appealing to the world at large to show concern for human 
rights in china 
if one just thinks about things and doesnt have the freedom to 
speak out then theres no freedom ren wrote in one essay 
explaining his motivation 
aware that his own arrest now would prove the point ren wrote in 
another i appeal to the power of international society for 
protection 
ren an accountant said in an interview that he spends most of 
his nonworking hours writing essays and plans to distribute batches 
of them each month to foreign and hong kong media 
he said he does not expect to persuade the government to change 
but wants to stimulate public debate and make chinas political 
prisoners better known abroad as are the dissidents in the soviet 
union 
ren also is indignant that as china celebrates the 10th 
anniversary of its opening to the outside world and economic reform 
under senior leader deng xiaoping activists who advocated many of 
the same reforms remain in jail 
those jailed like himself were leaders of the 197879 democracy 
wall movement during those few heady months intellectuals debated 
politics in homemimeographed journals and posters pasted on a wall 
in central beijing dubbed democracy wall 
ren insisted they had an impact despite their eventual silencing 
if one says that chinese society has progressed over 10 years 
and the economy has grown greatly all of this is because chinese 
social reformers paid the painful price of sacrificing their freedom 
and fortune he wrote without their brave spirit could chinese 
have as much freedom of discussion and modernization as they have 
today would the ruling authorities have voluntarily granted this 
such democracy wall themes as the need for multicandidate 
elections greater contact with the outside world and policies to 
end chinas backwardness have since been adopted by the government 
where then is the crime ren wrote 
despite thick glasses and a solemn manner ren looks younger than 
his 44 years his work at as an accountant at a beijing equipment 
installation company is not demanding he said but he has been 
given no chances for promotion 
officials have refused to transfer his wifes residence permit 
from tianjin to beijing 75 miles away she lives illegally in 
beijing with him making it impossible for her to find work 
ren said he has not told his 12yearold daughter that he was in 
prison 
his essays are closely argued outpourings of personal frustration 
and outraged principles in one he denounced communist authorities 
as narrowminded they fear the general public but bully small 
groups of people 
he also denounced the practice of bypassing the courts for 
misdemeanor cases and allowing police to hand out sentences for 
labor education 
there is no way to appeal in court and covzrups false 
arrests and illegalities are hidden he wrote why doesnt china 
even respect its own regulations 
ren who never was tried was ordered to undergo labor education 
but actually spent his four years in jail without labor and 
without education he said 
newly emerged from his long silence and without a wall or journal 
to proclaim his views ren seems uncertain how to proceed he said 
he has no plans to go to campuses and address chinas most volatile 
and receptive sector the students or to start up a publication 
so far neither his employers nor police have questioned him 
about his new political activity 
im not alone many people agree with me he said but he is 
at a loss to explain why he is the only one stepping into the 
dangerous limelight ive always been a freethinker he said

a littleknown deal between the white house and 
congress should make it easier for presidentelect bush to reach 
agreements with the rest of the world on tough trade issues such as 
the current dispute over hormones in us beef 
beginning sunday the 12 countries of the european economic 
community are banning all imports of meat treated with hormones 
including us beef and veal worth about 100 million a year the 
reagan administration promised to retaliate by raising duties on 
european food shipped here 
counterretaliations and countercounterretaliations are 
threatened in what some see as a potential trade war 
over the long run such conflicts can be limited by the united 
states using the fast track for making trade agreements a 
series of agreements is being drafted by 96 governments in the 
current uruguay round of trade talks 
despite its name the fast track is less important for its speed 
than for the power its gives the president reagan signed the latest 
version into law last august as part of a major trade bill on 
wednesday he issued an executive order on regulations to implement 
the new law 
it associates key members of congress closely with trade talks 
though not as actual negotiators after an agreement is reached 
congress is pledged to vote it up or down in 90 days no exceptions 
or conditions no internal bargaining over details 
that differs from the usual relations between the white house and 
capitol hill often the administration and congress bargain for 
months or even years over what goes into an important bill before it 
becomes law or fails 
the fast track allows the administration to make promises that 
are bound to be unpopular in congress such as ending protection for 
a small industry against foreign competition under the fast track 
system the negotiators can gamble that congress will accept the 
entire agreement even if many members dislike parts of it 
governments of other countries long have complained that they 
cannot get firm commitments from a us negotiator they can make 
firm promises themselves because the french or japanese prime 
ministers for example can threaten to dissolve parliament and 
force members to fight a new election unless his promises are 
supported a us president cant do that 
raymond vernon who negotiated for presidents from franklin 
roosevelt to jimmy carter tells a story about lord keynes the 
famous economist who came to washington to get more aid for britain 
in world war ii keynes was annoyed to hear one official after 
another explain how roosevelt favored many measures but congress 
would not approve them 
keynes dropped his usual politeness when one american more 
pompous than the others began by saying 
my government 
you know kenyes interrupted you people dont really have 
a government at all in the usual sense of the word 
many officials americans and nonamericans fail to grasp the 
difference between the american system and the parliamentary system 
nonamericans often complain that the united states has gone back on 
a pledge when a us negotiator promises his best effort to get 
something done and then congress not operating on the fast track 
refuses to do it 
some blamed president woodrow wilson for world war ii because he 
negotiated for a league of nations after world war i and congress 
refused to join it wilson failed to bring key senators close to the 
negotiations 
vernon identified the inventor of the fast track as richard l 
rivers a washington lawyer who worked for the senate finance 
committee in 1973 president nixon was trying to negotiate what was 
first called the nixon round of trade agreements the white 
house asked congress for a law that would give him almost unlimited 
power to negotiate but allow either house to disapprove the result 
rivers said in an interview that he will always remember former 
sen herman talmadge dga a key member of the finance committee 
fiery reaction to that proposal thats not the way we make our 
laws in this country 
the supreme court since has ruled that such legislative 
vetoes are unconstitutional 
rivers wrote a memorandum that devised the fast track for 
talmadge and it became law as part of the presidents authority to 
negotiate it was used under nixon and president ford to complete 
what became known as the tokyo round after nixon resigned 
later versions of the fast track have been used under reagan to 
negotiate free trade agreements with israel and canada 
in a recent book beyond globalism vernon has proposed 
widening it 
there is a strong temptation to look for a mechanism in which 
the main lines of trade policy monetary policy fiscal policy and 
establishment policy will have been jointly explored between the 
branches in an effort to identify the key assumptions establish the 
principal goals and iron out the gross inconsistencies he wrote 
but he added that it is difficult to envision an effective 
dialogue between the president and congress on so wide a range of 
issues 
vernon 75 years old has retired as a professor of international 
relations at harvard university his book was written with debora l 
spar who was studying for a doctorate there

it will be months before the agriculture 
department begins to estimate the size of 1989 farm crops but 
analysts are watching carefully how weather and conditions shape up 
effects of the savage 1988 drought and moisturesapping heat are 
still being felt in corn belt areas badly deficient in subsoil 
moisture corn and soybeans wont be planted until spring so 
theres some leeway 
but for winter wheat farmers who planted their 1989 crop this 
fall the crunch is on right now and in parts of the great plains 
the news is far from encouraging 
winter wheat fields in kansas continued to show signs of 
moisture stress the governments joint agricultural weather 
facility said wednesday greenbug infestation was a continuing 
problem 
texas farmers have been spraying to control the greenbugs and 
much of the winter wheat crop in the state also is hurting from lack

the agriculture department says the soviet 
union has continued its cornbuying splurge and has added some 
soybean meal making up for some orders it had canceled recently 
officials said wednesday the new sales included 600000 metric 
tons of corn and 600000 tons of soybean meal the cancellations 
earlier in the month had totaled more than 300000 tons 
in a separate announcement usda said china has bought an 
additional 200000 tons of wheat at subsidized prices part of 1 
million tons authorized for china on dec 7 only 10000 tons remain 
in that authorization 
the latest sales of corn to the kremlin brought the soviet 
unions total to 963 million tons in the agreements sixth year 
which began oct 1 last year us corn sales to the soviet union 
totaled slightly less than 52 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 600000 tons of 
corn would be about 236 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 263 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning the latest sale 
could have a farm value of around 62 million 
the soybean meal based on recent decatur ill prices could 
have a processor value of around 144 million 
although no wheat has yet been sold for 198889 delivery under 
the pact the soviets have ordered 500000 tons of soybeans and 
1132500 tons of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of grain sorghum

the agriculture department has proposed to 
reduce import restrictions on shipments of british swine pork and 
pork products 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said wednesday the proposal is a 
result of britains eradication of hog cholera a contagious and 
sometimes fatal disease of swine he said no cases of the disease 
have been reported since august 1987 
the restriction currently requires that pork and pork products be 
cooked heated or cured and dried before being shipped from britain 
to ensure that disease organisms were destroyed 
under the proposed rule change small quantities of untreated 
pork and pork products for personal consumption will be allowed to 
enter the united states from britain however commercial shipments 
must orginate only from plants which meet us requirements 
glosser said the proposal would affect some us swine producers 
who have expressed a desire to import swine breeding stock or semen 
from britain however he said these expected shipments would not 
have an impact on us swine production

the presidential panel charged with the task of 
recommending which military bases to close was conceived in a 1983 
report by a group of private businessmen on how the government could 
save money 
that 1983 group headed by industrialist wr grace proposed a 
nonpartisan commission to review the nations base structure and 
suggest which should be shut down 
the idea was to take congress out of the picture as much as 
possible because of the reluctance on capitol hill to permit bases 
to be closed shuttered installations mean lost jobs among voters 
and congress has blocked any base closings since 1977 
the grace panels proposal was received unenthusiastically in 
congress but in 1987 rep dick armey rtexas tried to win 
approval for the commission his amendment to a pentagon budget bill 
failed by seven votes 
armey was undaunted and spent much of the following winter 
rounding up support with congress under pressure to cut federal 
spending because of rising budget deficits there were predictions 
that closing unneeded bases could save as much as 5 billion a year 
defense secretary frank c carlucci signed on to the armey plan 
and appointed a commission last summer to begin work 
but congress delayed final approval until early october shortly 
before adjourning for the year the measure passed by congress and 
signed into law by president reagan created a 12member commission 
and a complicated procedure designed by armey and other supporters 
of closing bases as a way to circumvent congressional pressure 
once carlucci has received the panels recommendations he will 
have until jan 15 five days before he leaves office to either 
accept or reject the entire list carlucci cannot pick from among 
the list which is expected to recommend closing two dozen or more 
of the nations largest facilities 
if carlucci approves the list congress will have 45 legislative 
days starting march 1 to try to block it for that to happen both 
the house and senate would have to pass a disapproval resolution 
but that could be vetoed by george bush that means the resolution 
would need the twothirds support in each chamber required to 
override a veto 
the baseclosing commission has grouped all installations by 
military mission such as air force fighter bases and navy ports for 
surface ships then five factors will be used to define a 
facilitys military value including 
how well a base can fulfill its purpose for deployment of troops 
availability of physical facilities including runways storage 
areas and warehouses 
the physical condition and technical sophistication of those 
facilities 
quality of life for personnel and their families at the base 
community support including transportation utilities related 
industrial activities and technical help 
bases within a certain group such as air force fighter bases 
were ranked using those five criteria lowerranking bases were 
considered for closure if higherranking facilities could take over 
their duties 
other factors also were considered including cost evaluations of 
the money to be saved by closing a particular base environmental 
factors such as disposal of hazardous waste and the impact on the 
community of lost jobs

presidentelect bushs bass fishing 
excursion today takes him to a crossroads community that once played 
host to another vice president aaron burr 
bushs itinerary calls for about four hours of fishing with 
prominent alabama sportsman ray scott whose 55acre private lake is 
set in rolling countryside about 15 miles south of montgomery 
we just want to get in some fishing said scott who became a 
friend political ally and infrequent fishing partner of bush in 
1978 his fishing is so token he doesnt have a chance to get at 
it much 
scott who founded the bass anglers sportsman society two decades 
ago and sold the publishing enterprise for 15 million in 1986 is 
an outspoken conservationist who predicts bush will rival teddy 
roosevelt in supporting americas outdoors 
he feels weve spent enough money on research and its time 
for action said scott in an interview hell be reasonable but 
firm in protecting the environment 
scott who got a thanksgiving day call from bush to arrange the 
bass fishing outing has brought attention to a farm community that 
is composed mainly of a small elementary school a library a fire 
station and mosleys store and service station at the junction of 
us 31 and federal road 
scott who also has a whitetail deer research program on his 
land enjoys talking about the legends of pintlala including visits 
made by white house figures prior to bush 
he said the old federal road that crossed through pintlala a 
paved portion of which now runs in front of scotts gate was the 
route taken by gen andrew jackson on his way to new orleans for the 
battle of 1812 scott and historians also say burr the vice 
president who killed alexander hamilton in a duel paid an unplanned 
visit to pintlala in 1807 
burr was was captured in southwest alabama on treason charges in 
februrary 1807 and was brought up the federal road scott said burr 
spent one night at manacs tavern which was located at a site about 
a quartermile from scotts property at pintlala 
pintlala is a creek indian word that means fish swamp it 
once was a heavy creek settlement said scott manacs tavern 
was owned by sam manac a creek with large landholdings manacs 
son david was the first indian ever to graduate from west point 
the news media descended on mosleys store and service station in 
anticipation of bushs visit 
its been a threering circus around here said mary meadows 
as she prepared hot dogs for the lunch crowd wednesday scott said 
secret service agents had checked out every squirrel nest and deer 
stand on his property 
the only overt indication that the presidentelect was on his way 
was a sign outside the pintlala baptist church it read welcome 
president bush godspeed and good fishing 
scott who remains as a figurehead of the bass operation 
plays host at its fishing tournaments some of which are carried on 
cable television 
scott said he met bush in montgomery about 10 years ago and was 
asked to manage bushs 1980 campaign in alabama im not sure his 
pickin was too good otherwise he wouldnt have picked me said 
scott recalling their loss to ronald reagan in the states primary 
but im a good salesman thats about all politics is anyway 
he said we just always clicked

a trout farmer who lost his fishbreeding 
license for importing grasseating carp has vowed to continue his 
fight to bring the white amur into the state because of its unique 
way of weeding ponds 
state wildlife officials said they dropped criminal charges 
against warren candee because they failed to advise the breeder of 
his constitutional rights 
but the 75yearold candee is unrepentant 
god made these fish and if he made them to eat weeds why 
should we use chemicals to pollute our water systems he said 
the chairman of the state division of fisheries and wildlife said 
the agency has banned the fish and all other nonnative wildlife 
because their longterm effects on the environment are unknown 
mr candee certainly isnt a marine biologist nor is his 
lawyer george l darey said tuesday until were 100 percent 
sure that they wont have any negative effects on the environment 
we will not turn these fish loose 
candee said he imported the fish from arkansas and kept them in a 
cement pond behind his house the fish are native to the amur river 
which flows along the boarder of the soviet union and china 
darey said he is awaiting the findings of a fouryear study 
conducted by the new york state department of environmental 
conservation to determine whether massachusetts should continue its 
ban against the fish

president reagans decision to extend us 
territorial waters an additional nine miles offshore will make it 
more difficult for foreign countries to spy on american shores 
administration officials say 
reagan took the action wednesday at the bel air home where he 
will live after jan 20 he and first lady nancy reagan are spending 
the holidays there but were leaving today for three days in palm 
springs 
by a proclamation the president extended us sovereignty and 
jurisdiction from the present three miles to 12 miles 
maureen walker a foreign affairs officer in the state 
departments office of ocean law and policy said the extension 
makes the united states the 105th country to claim a 12mile limit 
the 12mile limit was called for in 1982 by the united nations 
convention on the law of the sea and the us action leaves only 
six countries claiming narrower bands of offshore water finland and 
norway claim four miles each and the dominican republic greece 
israel and turkey each claim six miles ms walker said 
it will make foreign intelligencegathering more difficult and 
less effective because foreign ships will no longer be able to 
station themselves off our shores within the 12mile limit the 
state department officer said 
the proclamation assures foreign ships the right of innocent 
passage through us territorial waters and the right to pass 
through straits 
ms walker said it would not affect us and state laws that 
govern offshore mineral and fishing rights 
it applies to the waters off the united states puerto rico 
guam american samoa the us virgin islands the northern mariana 
islands and any other territory over which the united states 
exercises sovereignty it applies to airspace over the ocean as 
well as the waters and the bed and subsoil of the ocean 
in another action the president extended for six months the 
state of emergency that he proclaimed in 1986 between the united 
states and libya the step was needed to continue in effect the 
presidents 1986 order blocking libyan assets in the united states 
in retaliation for alleged terrorist action 
the president also signed a sevenpage executive order 
implementing the 1100page trade act passed by the last congress 
white house deputy press secretary leslye arsht said the order will 
enable the united states to continue effectively to work for more 
open world markets and strengthened international institutions 
ms arsht said the presidents national security adviser lt 
gen colin l powell telephoned him at the bel air home to inform 
him of the announcement by the british department of transport that 
last weeks crash of pan american flight 103 in scotland was caused 
by a bomb 
the investigation will continue to determine how the explosives 
were introduced into the plane she said the fbi and the faa 
are working closely with the british and scottish authorities on the 
investigation we are determined to find out who did it using all 
available resources

judging by previous crashes in which bombing 
was suspected authorities investigating the pan american flight 103 
disaster may need a lucky break in the case to apprehend those who 
carried out the sabotage 
british authorities said wednesday that from examining wreckage 
they had gathered conclusive evidence that a bomb blew up the 
pan am boeing 747 jumbo jet over southern scotland last week 
spokesman john boyd said scotland yard and the fbi had joined forces 
in a criminal inquiry of international dimensions 
the challenge of finding those responsible is illustrated by 
looking at two crashes widely blamed on bombing the nov 29 1987 
crash of a korean air boeing 707 off the coast of burma and the 
plunge of an airindia 747 into the irish sea on june 22 1985 the 
korean air crash killed 115 people while the airindia tragedy 
claimed 329 lives 
in the incident involving korean air flight 858 suspicion 
quickly focused on two passengers a man and a woman who were 
detained for questioning about forged japanese passports in bahrain 
as they were about to board a plane for rome they had left the 
doomed korean aircraft bound from baghdad to bangkok at an 
intermediary stop in abu dhabi 
the pair who turned out to be north korean agents both bit into 
cyanide capsules hidden in cigarette filters the man identified as 
kim sung il 70 succeeded in his suicide attempt but the woman 
kim hyon hui 25 survived and was extradited to south korea 
after questioning by south korean authorities ms kim told a 
nationally televised news conference on jan 15 1988 that she had 
been involved in bombing the korean air jet she said the episode 
was intended to disrupt preparations for the 1988 seoul olympics and 
create unrest in the south 
i came out here hoping such violent meaningless incidents 
would never happen again in the future and i would like to apologize 
to family members of the dead and the people here by disclosing the 
truth she said in admitting her role in the incident 
south korean intelligence officers said ms kim was acting on the 
personal orders of kim jong il son and political heir of top north 
korean leader kim il sung 
north korea officially denied involvement with the crash 
by contrast in the crash of airindia flight 182 lengthy 
investigations by indian canadian british and irish authorities 
have failed to conclusively pinpoint blame for the tragedy 
soon after the crash unidentified callers to news media said the 
crash was the work of extremists associated with sikh separatist 
organizations spokesmen for sikh groups however denied any role 
and accused india of trying to foment antisikh sentiment 
according to indian officials tapes from the planes cockpit 
voice and flight data recorders recovered from 6700 feet below the 
surface of the irish sea neither proved nor disproved the 
possibility that sabotage was involved one official sn sharma 
told reporters the cockpit conversation was normal until it came to 
a sudden and abrupt end 
a report by canadas aviation safety board disclosed in january 
1986 said there was considerable circumstantial and other 
evidence that an explosive device detonated in the front cargo 
compartment of the plane which was headed from toronto to bombay 
via london 
the report linked the explosion to a suitcase checked onto the 
flight by a man using the name singh who did not board the plane 
singh meaning lion is a name used by all male sikhs 
a book published in canada in may 1987 pointed to the lack of 
arrests in the airindia case 
among the bereaved families the call for justice is louder 
the bitterness and cynicism sharper than at any time since the 
crash said the book the sorrow and the terror 
the book by awardwinning canadian writers clark blaise and his 
indiaborn wife bharati mukherjee claimed that four members of a 
sikh terrorist cell in vancouver british columbia were suspected 
by police 
it also claimed that the principals in the case celebrated with 
pizza at a sikh temple in the toronto suburb of malton at about the 
time the airindia jet plunged into the sea 
the problem is to have a case solid enough to prove in court the 
authors said to lose the case on any kind of technicality would 
be a political nightmare according to the book

although they may not be available this winter 
44 underutilized government buildings and 50 land sites have 
been designated by the reagan administration as suitable for 
sheltering the nations homeless 
meeting a courtappointed deadline the department of housing and 
urban development on thursday ruled that 94 of the 220 pieces of 
property it reviewed in the past two weeks are suitable for 
assisting homeless people 
however only 33 of the buildings were determined to be suitable 
for overnight occupancy or for daytime activities another 11 were 
called suitable only for nonoccupancy programs such as warehousing 
food and clothing 
james e schoenberger deputy assistant hud secretary for 
housing said the unused or underutilized land parcels could be used 
as sites for erecting mobile homes or modular units as temporary 
shelters 
it is problematic whether any of the facilities might be made 
available for the homeless before this winter is over 
this is a multistage process and hud is sort of in the middle 
of it schoenberger said but this could be a relatively quick 
process from this point on 
some of the properties could be made available in less than 45 
days hud officials said assuming they meet local health and 
building codes 
city and state officials or private nonprofit organizations 
wanting to use the buildings or land have 30 days to submit 
applications the general services administration and the department 
of health and human services which own the properties then have a 
maximum of 15 days to review the applications 
hud was under a dec 28 deadline imposed two weeks ago by us 
district court judge oliver gasch here to review at least half of 
350 properties listed by gsa and hhs as being excess or surplus he 
gave hud until jan 12 to survey the rest of the listed properties 
which includes some 1000 buildings 
the government defines excess property as buildings or land under 
the authority of a particular agency that doesnt have any use for 
it surplus property is that for which no government agency has any 
use 
because hud had only two weeks under gaschs order to come up 
with a list schoenberger said the determinations of suitability 
were made solely on the basis of questionnaires filled out by gsa 
and hhs 
we originally intended to have hud field office staff inspect 
all properties which appeared to be suitable he said however 
the short amount of time allowed required that we omit the 
onsite property inspection 
gasch imposed the deadlines in response to a suit filed last 
september by the national coalition for the homeless accusing the 
administration of failing to implement a law passed in july 1987 to 
make underutilized federal property available for use as 
emergency shelters 
maris foscarinis an attorney for the coalition called 
presidentelect bushs support of the program encouraging but said 
it is shameful that the reagan administration forced a protracted 
court battle before obeying a congressional mandate 
of the 126 facilities found unsuitable because they lack sound 
floors foundations roofs walls electric power or sanitary or 
water facilities 53 are buildings and 73 are land sites 
the locations of unused or underutilized federally owned 
buildings listed as suitable for overnight shelters were listed as 
bell point arena tracy and west los angeles calif

presidentelect bush has picked no 2 cia 
official robert m gates as his deputy national security adviser and 
is nominating career intelligence analyst richard j kerr to replace 
gates at the spy agency 
gates knows the system the critical importance of the 
interagency process for presidential decisionmaking and the details 
of the management of that process bush said wednesday in a 
statement issued in washington while he was hunting in texas 
gates gained national attention in the spring of 1987 when 
president reagan nominated him to succeed the late william j casey 
as director of central intelligence 
furor over the irancontra affair delayed senate confirmation of 
the nomination and gates asked that his name be withdrawn in march 
1987 
gates has denied consistently that he tried to cover up the cia 
role in the iran arms deal and he has kept a high reputation among 
intelligence experts on capitol hill 
the vicechairman of the senate intelligence committee sen 
william cohen rme said wednesday that gates brings a 
tremendous reservoir of talent to the national security council 
staff 
cohen in a statement issued through a spokeswoman called gates 
an outstanding choice bob gates is a loss for the intelligence 
agency and a gain for the national security council 
gates would serve as deputy to bushs designated national 
security adviser retired air force gen brent scowcroft now lt 
col colin l powell is national security adviser and john d 
negroponte is his deputy 
gates appointment is not subject to senate confirmation that of 
kerr as deputy to cia director william webster is subject to 
hearings by the senate intelligence panel and a twothirds vote of 
the full senate 
had gates been confirmed as director of central intelligence he 
would have been the first cia analyst to have attained that post 
previous cia directors either have served in the spy agencys 
clandestine service or have come from outside like webster or bush 
who was cia chief in 1976 
kerr has spent his career as a cia analyst and administrator 
webster said the appointment of gates is tribute to him and a 
vote of confidence for the agency while we will miss him here his 
appointment is a real plus for the national security of this 
country 
kerr is a highly qualified cia career officer said 
webster as deputy director for intelligence heading up the 
analytical side of the agency kerr is my principal adviser on the 
production of finished intelligence and is widely respected 
throughout the intelligence community 
the kerr selection also won praise on capitol hill 
dick kerrs appointment sends a message that the new 
administration is recognizing professional excellence in selecting 
top officials in the intelligence area said sen david boren 
dokla chairman of the senate intelligence committee 
gates 45 has served with the cia for 22 years including a 
fiveyear loan from 197479 to the nsc staff 
he was raised in wichita kan where he earned straight as in 
high school and was an eagle scout he received a bachelors degree 
from william and mary college in 1965 a masters degree from 
indiana university in 1966 and a doctorate in russian history from 
georgetown university in 1974 
gates was deputy director for intelligence for more than four 
years and according to one intelligence source greatly improved the 
quality of cia reports 
kerr 53 joined the cia as a military analyst in 1960 
concentrating on biographical and reference material relating to the 
soviet union according to a biography released by the bush 
transition office kerr also has worked as an imagery analyst 
apparently scrutinizing satellite photographs 
kerr received a bachelors degree in history and did some 
graduate work at the university of oregon

wiretaps on the telephones of a defense 
consultant and bugging devices in his office have helped 
investigators paint a picture of alleged contract fraud and bribery 
involving a top air force procurement official according to a 
government affidavit 
the eavesdropping on conversations between victor d cohen a 
deputy to the assistant air force secretary for acquisitions and 
consultant william galvin showed that cohen has used his official 
position to help galvin or his clients in exchange for payments 
and other gratuities the document says 
one example outlined in the affidavit involves cubic corp of san 
diego a client of galvin and maker of shells that house electronic 
gear called pods sometime before april 1 1987 when galvins 
phones were tapped galvin asked cohen to award an unidentified pod 
contract to cubic on a solesource basis so that cubic would be the 
only supplier the document says 
in a tapped phone conversation may 15 1987 cohen told galvin he 
wouldnt award the contract to cubic as a sole source but he said 
he planned to have the air force issue the request for proposal with 
a required delivery schedule that cubics competitor could not meet 
the affidavit says 
cohen assured galvin that by doing it this way the procurement 
would appear to have been completed when in actuality cubic would 
be guaranteed the award of the contract the document said 
cohen also said he would have the navy exercise an option on a 
joint air forcenavy project being built by cubics competitor this 
way cohen assured galvin the competitor would not protest the 
delivery schedule and he would not have to justify a sole source 
procurement the document says 
however colvin wellborn president of cubic didnt like the 
plan wellborn told galvin in a phone conversation may 21 1987 
there was adequate justification for giving cubic the contract as a 
sole source and he saw no reason to do a crooked competition 
the affidavit said 
the document says that later that day galvin told wellborn that 
cohen had changed his mind and the contract would be given to cubic 
as a sole source 
the 98 million contract was awarded to cubic in december 1987 
the affidavit which was used to justify a search last june of 
cohens home in potomac md does not tie a specific payment from 
cubic or galvin to cohen for that contract or for other contracts 
mentioned 
however the document alleged that cohens willingness to 
assist cubic in obtaining government contracts can be traced to what 
is believed to be the receipt of a payment from cubic the section 
in the affidavit that follows that statement was deleted as were 
other parts of the document at the request of the us attorneys 
office 
the affidavit also says that cohen appears to have been paid by 
galvin and two of his other clients unisys corp and loral 
electronic systems division 
a receptionist in cohens office said he was on leave and 
could not be reached for comment his home telephone number is 
unpublished 
cubic and loral are closed for the holidays and officials could 
not be reached for comment charles fc ruff an attorney for 
unisys said he had no comment 
the cohen affidavit and portions of two others were released on 
tuesday in response to a lawsuit by the washington post a hearing 
is scheduled for friday to determine whether portions of the 
affidavits that were deleted should also be unsealed 
the other two affidavits supported searches of the berwyn 
heights md house of richard seelmeyer a selfemployed 
consultant and the rockville md home and office of consultant 
bill sanda 
these locations along with cohens home were among 40 locations 
raided by fbi agents last june when the case was first revealed no 
indictments have been handed down 
prosecutors have said they have evidence that consultants 
including some former top pentagon officials who worked for the 
nations largest defense contractors bribed defense department 
officials for information that helped them win billions of dollars 
in government contracts

when nezar hindawi wanted to blow up an israeli 
plane in 1986 he packed his girlfriends suitcase with three pounds 
of an odorless explosive called semtex and sent her to londons 
heathrow airport to board an el al boeing 747 
the bomb which was preset to detonate passed through an 
airport xray machine and it was discovered only after an el al 
security guard questioned the young woman annemarie murphy who 
was unaware she was carrying the explosive device 
terrorism experts say semtex which is one of the substances 
suspected in the bombing last week of pan am flight 103 over 
scotland is a terrorists dream so far it has defied all 
detection attempts by xray machines dogs trained to sniff bombs 
and other devices 
its a favorite with these groups because its significantly 
harder to detect than anything else its more powerful than other 
plastics said george carver a senior cia analyst in the 1960s 
and 1970s who now is a researcher at the center for strategic and 
international studies a washington think tank 
like its american cousin c4 semtex is malleable like putty and 
shows up on an xray operators screen as an indistinct dense mass 
but unlike c4 and other known plastic bombs semtex is odorless 
semtex also has the advantage of being stable meaning it cannot 
go off unless it is meant to terrorism experts including neil 
livingstone of georgetown university say semtex is so reliable it 
has been used by arab terrorists sending letter bombs to israeli 
officials 
technology is being developed to overcome the semtex threat and 
two experimental devices are in use at the los angeles and san 
francisco airports the devices shoot neutrons which can interact 
chemically with plastic explosives in luggage and indicate the 
existence of a bomb 
czechoslovakia which has a welldeveloped staterun arms and 
munitions industry makes semtex at a plant called the eastern 
bohemian works livingstone said state department officials say 
they have asked czech authorities in the past to stop making semtex 
or at least to prevent its export 
recently czechoslovakia indicated it might be willing to stop 
selling semtex said livingstone who has served as a consultant to 
government security and intelligence agencies and has written seven 
books on international security and terrorism 
czechoslovakia is believed to have supplied semtex to syria and 
libya said one state department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
in testimony at hindawis 1986 trial british authorities said 
syria had supplied the bomb for the el al plane the british 
government subsequently broke off diplomatic relations with syria 
over the affair although ties later were restored 
the state department official said libya has supplied semtex in 
several shiploads of weapons to the irish republican army in 1986 
and 1987 and may have given it to other terrorist groups 
semtex also is believed to have been used by a tiny syrian and 
libyansupported palestinian group once known as the may 15 
organization and which is now known as the hawari group 
the group is believed to have been responsible for the april 1986 
explosion aboard a twa boeing 727 flying from rome to athens four 
americans were killed in the blast which greek investigators said 
probably was caused by a semtex bomb the size of two or three 
cigarette packs the bomb was placed under a seat in row 10 
the hawari group specializes in plastic bombs according to us 
counterterrorism experts one of its operatives mohammed rashid is 
being sought by the united states for questioning in the 1982 
bombing of a pan am jetliner over hawaii which resulted in one death

while xray machines are severely limited in 
keeping modern explosives off airliners researchers say they have 
developed a device that can detect bombs inside luggage with uncanny 
regularity 
but no airline has ordered one of the devices and with the 
exception of two prototype machines used in a yearlong test program 
in san francisco and los angeles no airports have put the machine 
into operation 
the disclosure wednesday that a bomb detonated aboard a pan am 
jumbo jet last week over scotland killing all 259 people aboard is 
likely to spur interest in the new explosives detection device 
industry officials said 
the machine goes by the name of termal neutron analysis device 
or tna and is about twice the size of an airport xray machine 
during the yearlong test under a contract from the federal aviation 
administration it demonstrated a 95 percent detection rate with few 
false alarms the agency said 
the faa recently ordered five more tnas at a cost of 84 
million the agency plans to put them into other us airports 
beginning next summer 
we are now in the production phase the research and 
development is over said hadi bozorgmanesh a vice president for 
science applications international corp of san diego the developer 
of the machine he said the five machines will be used to routinely 
monitor baggage checked on regularly scheduled flights 
once the faa and airlines are convinced of the reliability of the 
machines the agency is likely to require the devices be installed 
at certain us airports but that is expected to be several years 
away according to agency sources 
bozorgmanesh said his company also has had inquiries from a 
number of foreign governments including britain japan and italy 
but none of them have put in orders he added 
bozorgmanesh said he is confident the machine can detect a wide 
variety of explosives even the plastic type of explosive which is 
believed to have been smuggled aboard the pan am jetliner in a piece 
of checked luggage 
security officials use the conventional xray machines that are 
currently at airport screening points to detect metal parts or 
wiring that might resemble a bomb but there are many explosives 
that can be shaped in a variety of innocentlooking forms and they 
are so powerful that a few pounds can rip apart a jetliner 
however the tna machine does not look for certain sizes or 
shapes it relies instead on the fact that all explosives contain 
large and concentrated amounts of nitrogen 
according to tnas developers the machine bombards a piece of 
luggage with neutrons which pass through all types of material 
even sheets of lead without a significant reaction but the 
nitrogen in explosives absorbs the neutrons and immediately gives 
off gamma radiation the gamma radiation gives the luggage a unique 
signature that can be detected by the machine 
the amount of radiation has no significant effect on the suitcase 
or its contents bozorgmanesh said 
the faa with a nudge from congress stepped up its development 
of bomb detection devices after a terrorist bomb apparently caused 
an airindia jumbo jet to crash off the irish coast in l985 and a 
bomb detonated aboard a trans world airlines jet over the 
mediterranean in 1986 killing four americans 
while the technology soon became workable in a laboratory 
environment adapting it for use at a crowded airport where 
thousands of pieces of luggage must be scanned in a short period was 
more of a challenge 
raymond salazar director of aviation security at the faa said 
initially there were too many false alarms but those problems 
appear to have been resolved our results have been very very 
satisfactory he said 
according to the faa the device is capable of scanning a piece 
of luggage in six seconds and can be adapted for use with a conveyor 
system that could handle large numbers of baggage in relatively 
short periods of time with a low rate of false alarms 
you could do an entire boeing 747 in a half hour or so 
bozorgmanesh said in a telephone interview from the companys san 
diego office 
each machine now costs more than 1 million but eventually the 
cost is expected to range from about 500000 to 900000 depending 
on how many are produced according to faa and industry estimates 
we could produce a lot of them in a short period of time 
bozorgmanesh said but he added the airlines are not lined up 
right now to purchase these things we have to demonstrate to them 
that it works

a flight carrying 40 passengers was diverted for an 
unscheduled landing at logan international airport wednesday after 
losing cabin pressurization apparently due to a faulty valve 
officials said 
continental airlines flight 269 from hartford conn to 
cleveland had been airborne for about a half hour when the cabin of 
the boeing 737 aircraft depressurized said continental spokesman 
dave messing in houston passengers were told to use oxygen masks 
and noone was injured he said 
the flight was diverted to logan where it landed without 
incident at about 5 pm and passengers were put on other flights 
the plane was to be repaired overnight messing said 
the mechanics are looking at it at this point it appears the 
depressurization stemmed from a faulty valve in the pressurization 
system he said

abc had its first no 1 series since 1984 when 
roseanne edged nbcs the cosby show for the top spot in the 
weekly ac nielsen co ratings 
the last abc no 1 show that was a regularly scheduled series was 
the dec 19 1984 episode of dynasty 
due to expected low holiday week viewing nbc loaded up its 
schedule with repeats a firstrun roseanne beat a repeat of 
cosby 
the rest of the top 10 were cheers nbc whos the boss 
abc monday night football abc a different world nbc 
la law nbc matlock nbc night court nbc and in 
the heat of the night nbc 
cbs highestrated shows of the week were designing women at 
17th followed by murphy brown at 18th 
nbc racked up its 27th straight weekly victory if nbc wins the 
rest of the season it would be the first time a network has done so 
since cbs won every week of the 196364 season nbc came within a 
week of that 39week record last year but the world series on abc 
broke the streak 
if nbc does set a record for 198889 it will be with an asterisk 
because the writers strike delayed abcs and cbs fall lineups 
while nbc began the season with the summer olympics 
nbc won the week that ended sunday with an average primetime 
rating of 137 to abcs 117 and cbs 109 the season officially 
began 14 weeks ago giving nbc a seasontodate average rating of 
160 to abcs 131 and cbs 119 abc and cbs count the season as 
having begun in late october at which time they had gotten most of 
their strikedelayed new shows on the air 
each rating point equals 904000 households with television 
the network news race is so close the ratings changed ever so 
slightly last week and turned the standings around the cbs 
evening news resumed first place with an average 110 rating 
abc world news tonight had 108 and nbc nightly news had 
106 
due to christmas eve and christmas day falling on saturday and 
sunday the only two nights of fox programming fox ran all repeats 
and suffered an expectable drop in ratings its lowestrated show 
beyond tomorrow had a meager 19 rating

at a city council meeting this month 
mayor hitoshi motoshima was asked his opinion of emperor hirohitos 
wartime responsibility an especially sensitive question 
considering the monarchs frail condition 
the mayors response that hirohito shares the blame for world 
war ii and might have spared this city the atomic bomb has created 
a nationwide backlash that includes calls for motoshimas ouster and 
huge antimotoshima rallies 
it cost motoshima the support of the governing party and will 
likely cost him a fourth term in office and it illustrated the 
risks of speaking negatively of the 87yearold emperor 
at the meeting motoshima said that judging from historical 
accounts and his own wartime experience i believe the emperor 
shares responsibility for the war as well as all of us who lived in 
that period 
coming on the 47th anniversary of the bombing of pearl harbor 
the comments were seen as especially inappropriate by japanese who 
consider it despicable to criticize a suffering person 
more than 100 trucks with loudspeakers paraded through the city 
center blaring demands that motoshima be removed from office about 
1200 riot police were mobilized both to guard the mayor and to 
prevent street violence 
apart from leaders of the antiemperor communist party few 
public figures have spoken about hirohitos wartime role since he 
became seriously ill three months ago with intestinal bleeding and 
has been hovering near death since 
soon after motoshimas comment which came in response to a 
question from a communist municipal assembly member rightwingers 
had about 10 sound trucks roaring down nagasakis streets 
rightists from many parts of japan converged on this port city of 
450000 
on dec 21 and 22 about 100 sound trucks surrounded city hall 
for three hours each afternoon 
haranguing speeches and slogans like death to motoshima and 
kick the traitor out of japan blared from loudspeakers and 
about 260 radical rightists wearing militarystyle uniforms were 
present 
a delegation from the liberal democratic party which controls 
the national government and had backed the indepependent motoshima 
since he took office in 1979 demanded the mayor retract the 
comments 
when he refused the party decided to withdraw its support 
making it unlikely motoshima could win a fourth term 
it was an act of extreme indiscretion for a public figure like 
him to express such a view publicly at this time when the emperor is 
ill said shigeki honda deputy head of the party in nagasaki 
prefecture 
motoshima has received death threats and last week a rightist 
charged into city hall carrying a can of gasoline he was arrested 
before he could do any damage 
i never felt in such immense danger to my personal safety as 
well as to my familys in my life the mayor told the associated 
press 
how can i take it back when i said what i believe he asked 
i feel the withdrawal of my statement would endanger the hardwon 
freedom of speech in this country 
his view of the emperors partial responsibility for the war is 
believed widely held among japanese especially intellectuals 
hirohito was a figurehead while real power was held by 
militarists but he was able to decide to end the war when the 
government was evenly divided in august 1945 after the united 
states dropped atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki 
in nagasaki on that aug 9 more than 70000 people died about 
35 percent of the citys population in hiroshima which took the 
first bomb aug 6 the death toll was about 140000 
especially among the people of nagasaki there is a strong 
feeling that if the emperor could stop the war on aug 15 1945 why 
couldnt he have done it a week earlier so the tragedy on aug 9 
could have been avoided motoshima told the ap 
he said the japanese have been wrong to put such a taboo on 
discussing the wartime role of the emperor revered as a shinto god 
i said what i believe but to be honest i did not expect this 
would cause such a big fuss he said i guess the real mistake 
was i waited to say it until now 
he blamed the fear of rightist attacks and the complexity of 
the matter for making most japanese hesitate to even talk about it 
some nagasaki citizens have expressed support for the mayor 
he said what long needed to be said said shigetoshi 
iwamatsu a social studies professor at nagasaki university right 
now the more serious problem is the rightists threat to freedom of 
speech 
said tatsuichiro akizuki a noted peace activist and president of 
st francis hospital this incident shows how crippled we are in 
discussing the emperor properly and objectively 
the question of the emperors responsibility in the war was 
left out of our mind for so long that most of us have forgotten how 
to deal with it

federal regulators are racing the clock to 
complete a string of bailout packages for insolvent savings and loan 
institutions before the end of the year when tax breaks for 
investors will be cut in half 
officials expect that before sunday as many as 200 failed savings 
and loans will have been dealt with this year setting a 
postdepression record by contrast 48 sampls were merged or closed 
last year 
so far the federal home loan bank board has handled the cases of 
184 failed sampls including two bailouts announced wednesday that are 
among the largest 
the bank board put together a 51 billion package to assist in 
the takeover of five of the most troubled savings and loans in texas 
by an investment group led by ronald o perelman the head of 
revlon the cosmetics company 
also on wednesday the bank board pledged 17 billion in 
government assistance in the purchase of american savings and loan 
association of stockton calif the nations largest insolvent sampl 
by a group headed by texas billionaire robert m bass 
the size of the government assistance packages being required to 
attract new investors points up the depth of the problem facing the 
sampl industry and the incoming bush administration analysts said 
the trouble is that virtually all of the options presidentelect 
bush can select from to deal with the crisis involve spending more 
federal money which will in turn worsen his other big economic 
problem finding a way to narrow the federal budget deficit without 
resorting to new taxes 
estimates of the total cost to the government of resolving the 
sampl mess range as high as 112 billion and losses are mounting by 
1 billion a month for this reason analysts said bush cannot 
afford to delay seeking a solution 
the bush administration will be committing political suicide if 
it doesnt candidly address this problem immediately after taking 
office said bert ely a financial consultant based in alexandria 
va this is a big expensive problem and it is getting bigger 
the bank board worked late into the night wednesday as the agency 
raced the clock to finish as many deals as possible before jan 1 
when certain tax writeoffs will expire 
the provisions that will expire had allowed firms purchasing 
failed sampls to deduct the previous losses of those associations from 
profits the firms earned on other operations 
the loss of that provision will effectively cut the tax benefit 
to purchasers in half in virtually all transactions completed in 
1988 the firms taking over the sampls will qualify for tax breaks 
that will exceed what they are paying for the institutions 
critics have charged that even though the size of the lost tax 
revenues will be enormous the bank board is not taking this revenue 
drain into account in figuring the total cost to the government of 
the bailout packages 
in a recent letter to bank board chairman m danny wall rep 
charles schumer dny said he was concerned about the tax 
benefits being handed out and he said congress would likely look 
into that in the new year 
even with the postdepression record number of insolvent sampls 
being handled this year more than 400 insolvent institutions remain 
open and hundreds more are close to insolvency 
so far the government assistance has come primarily from the 
insurance fees the healthy sampls pay to the federal agency which 
insures individual deposits up to 100000 
but the federal savings and loan insurance corp which is an arm 
of the bank board is itself technically insolvent with its 
obligations to merge or close sick sampls far outweighing the revenue 
stream expected from industry fees 
it is this gap which critics say the bush administration and 
congress will have to find a way of closing even now the reagan 
administration is grappling with the problem of finding additional 
money for sampls in its final budget which must be submitted to 
congress on jan 9 
all of the sampls being taken over this week have been insolvent 
for several years but have been kept open because the insurance fund 
did not have enough cash to pay off depositors or shut them down 
some in congress have criticized the bank boards rescue packages 
for failing to attract enough money from the investors taking over 
the failed sampls 
but wall said wednesday that the cost to the government of simply 
closing the insolvent institutions and paying off depositors to the 
maximum of 100000 would be far more costly 
in addition to the american savings rescue plan and the takeover 
of five of the most troubled texas institutions the bank board on 
wednesday also approved takeovers of 
first federal savings and loan association of columbus ga by 
barnett bank inc of jacksonville 
mclean federal savings and loan of virginia by nvryan lp a 
home construction company 
first financial savings bank of des moines iowa by 
metropolitan federal bank of iowa

although us and european officials agree that 
the scientific debate over hormonetreated meat is just one aspect 
in their crossatlantic trade dispute it nonetheless has focused 
concern on whether health safety is being sacrificed for profits 
european consumers and us health advocacy groups say eating 
hormonetreated meat may be hazardous to your health but many 
american scientists and government officials disagree 
the debate has been spotlighted by a ban that the european 
economic community plans to implement jan 1 against hormonetreated 
beef and veal from the united states and all other foreign suppliers 
the ban which will cost us meat producers some 100 million in 
export sales to the 12nation eec has sparked a warning of us 
retaliation against some european food products that could 
deteriorate into a fullscale trade war 
producers of beef and veal treat their cattle with hormones in 
order to make them grow faster but us regulatory officials say 
the quantities are minuscule compared with the amounts of the same 
hormones produced naturally by the human body 
the maximum dose allowed by the food and drug administration for 
cattle equals onetenth of the amount of the hormone found in 
prepubescent children who have the lowest hormone level in humans 
its totally inconsequential richard teske deputy director of 
the fdas center for veterinary medicine said wednesday 
the fda approves only three kinds of hormone treatment estrogen 
progesterone and testosterone it banned diethyl stilbestrol or 
des 10 years ago after it was proven to be cancercausing 
use of des by european cattle growers resulted in a scare for 
italian consumers in 1980 when hundreds of children showed signs of 
early sexual development such as breast growth 
similar reports of prepubescent development among some 3000 
puerto rican children in the early 1980s were never traced back to 
hormone use in animals tiske said 
residues of des also were discovered in residents of west germany 
and holland prompting a consumer movement that led to europeanwide 
legislation against hormonetreated meat 
but unlike european breeders who in the past injected hormones 
into the skeletal parts of the cattle american cattle raisers are 
only allowed to administer the hormones to the nonedible parts of 
the animals 
under fda regulations the hormone pellets are shot into the 
animals ears from where they release the substance slowly into the 
blood stream thus humans do not ingest meat with a high 
concentration of hormones 
some abuses of the fda standards have been reported such as meat 
producers who inject the pellet into the edible portion of the 
cattle to make the hormones spread faster teske said but such 
cases are rare and there are no known blackmarket exports to 
european consumers he added 
ironically there have been many more reported cases of 
blackmarket meat sales in europe and the european parliament is 
investigating reports of hormone treatment of animals in defiance of 
the eec ban 
but some american consumers despite assurances from the fda 
have decided to take their case directly to the retailers 
the question is whether consumers should be forced to wait 
until the scientific dust settles or whether its better to be safe 
than sorry said dan howell of the center for science in the 
public interest a consumer advocacy group concerned with nutrition 
and health issues 
the center has been spearheading a grassroots campaign to 
encourage consumers to demand hormonefree meat several businesses 
already produce it 
howell said that despite the lack of conclusive scientific 
evidence of a direct link between cancer and hormonetreated meat 
the government has been derelict in failing to pursue more research 
he attributed the reluctance partly to a decline in government 
regulation under the reagan administration and partly to pressure 
from the cattle industry

many disabled veterans may be missing out on 
hundreds of dollars worth of benefits from the veterans 
administration because the payments are calculated with outdated 
medical standards according to a congressional study 
the va responding to the report wednesday by the general 
accounting office said it has agreed to make the first 
comprehensive overhaul of the medical standards since 1945 
the standards have been updated on a piecemeal basis over the 
past few decades the report said but they still fail to take into 
account many medical advances 
as a result the gao said many veterans may be over or 
undercompensated for injuries that occurred both during military 
duty and afterward 
va cannot ensure that veterans are given accurate and uniform 
disability ratings because the rating schedule has not been adjusted 
to incorporate the results of many recent medical advances the 
study said 
the va paid about 143 billion in disability benefits to about 
38 million veterans and their survivors in 1987 said the gao the 
investigative branch of congress 
it is inherently difficult to achieve uniform and accurate 
administration of this type of program outofdate rating schedules 
make it almost impossible according to the report 
some medical conditions are not listed in the schedule which 
means a va rating specialist must use his or her own judgment to 
classify the disability the report said 
veterans administrator thomas k turnage responding to the 
study said he would prepare a plan for a methodical review of 
the rating schedule and added that he agreed with a recommendation 
that the schedule be reviewed regularly from now on 
the department of defense said it agreed with the reports 
findings 
a 1983 internal study by the va used 13 sample cases representing 
23 separate disabilities for which veterans already had been awarded 
compensation benefits those cases were sent to 56 of the 58 va 
regional offices to be classified 
in one case a veteran with hypertensive heart disease was 
assigned five different ratings ranging from 10 percent disability 
to 100 percent twentyfive rating boards gave him a 30 percent 
disability or 202 per month in benefits and 21 boards gave him 60 
percent or 516 in benefits 
in another case a veteran with post traumatic stress disorder 
was rated from zero to 70 percent disabled by the various boards 
which would have meant anywhere from no benefits to 410 a month 
the report said 
in a gao survey of 383 va rating specialists 61 percent said it 
was somewhat likely or very likely that in rating mental 
disorders they could reach two or more rating percentages with the 
same medical evidence 
fiftyone percent said the same situation could occur in rating 
neurological and convulsive disorders and for all types of illness 
22 percent said it was likely to reach more than one conclusion with 
the same medical evidence

the government filed a 823 million suit 
against ei du pont de nemours amp co accusing the chemicals giant 
of helping produce gasoline containing too much lead at a new jersey 
refinery from 1983 through 1985 
the company a major supplier of lead compounds said the suit 
was without merit because it was not subject to the regulations 
it is accused of violating 
the environmental protection agency said a complaint filed 
wednesday in us district court in newark nj charged that a 
joint venture of du pont and three other companies put 2 billion 
grams too much lead 2200 tons in gasoline blended at carteret 
nj 
the government seeks the maximum fine of 10000 a day for each 
of the 823 days specified in the complaint 
epa in 1986 filed an administrative complaint against du pont but 
was unable to reach a settlement with the company 
in wilmington del company spokesman tom barry read a statement 
from jerry mccleskey planning director of the companys chemicals 
and pigments department charging that epas action was without 
merit 
the allegations are false we will contest the novel and 
strained interpretation of the regulations we complied fully with 
all regulations applicable to lead suppliers and cannot be held 
responsible for alleged violations by others mccleskey said 
later barry himself said it was simply not a fact that the 
operation was a joint venture as epa said 
du pont said it was only a supplier but epa contended that du 
pont decided how much lead was to be used injected the compound at 
the blending plant determined that the final product was suitable 
for sale as leaded gasoline and advised the other participants in 
the venture about epa regulations 
the activities in effect made du pont a refiner subject to the 
refining regulations and just as responsible for the excess lead as 
any of the other parties epa said 
the agency filed administrative complaints against the other 
three companies two of which are now inactive the third a 
tarricone inc a new york petroleum marketer is operating under 
protection of the bankruptcy courts and epa said it had filed a 
claim against that company in the bankruptcy case 
lead is the cheapest way to increase gasoline octane but high 
concentrations in auto emissions can cause neurological damage to 
children and may contribute to high blood pressure in adults it 
also damages pollution control equipment in cars not designed for 
leaded gasoline 
epa has been ordering lower concentrations of lead in leaded 
gasoline for years the 1982 limit of 11 gram per gallon was 
reduced to 05 gram on july 1 1985 and 01 gram on jan 1 1986 
the 2 billion grams of excessive lead added by the carteret plant 
would amount to about 2 percent of all lead used in fuels in 
19831985 according to epa estimates

mayor marion barry wanted to blame city police 
for unfairly raising suspicions about him in connection with the 
aborted drug investigation of an acquaintance but his senior aides 
refused to go along with the plan according to a published report 
barry met with his aides wednesday in an attempt to draft a 
formal response to accusations that he consorted with a man police 
identified as a drug suspect 
the washington post reported today that barry had planned to 
suggest that his visits to a downtown hotel to meet former city 
employee charles lewis involved no wrongdoing and that poor police 
work had unfairly raised suspicions about him however three of 
barrys aides refused to endorse the plan the newspaper reported 
citing sources it did not identify 
in advance of an expected statement by barry today on the 
incident one official and a city council called on him to explain 
publicly his relationship with lewis 
city councilman james nathanson said wednesday that barry is 
suffering a credibility problem with various council members and 
other city officials 
my reaction is its too bad were here again said 
nathanson referring to allegations of drug involvement that have 
dogged barry for several years my only suggestion is that the 
mayor make a public statement about whats happening with him just 
lay it on the line 
police investigators have turned over to the us attorneys 
office the results of an internal probe into why two detectives were 
stopped from attempting an undercover drug buy from lewis last 
thursday after barry turned up at lewis hotel room 
barry has since acknowledged making several calls upon lewis 
whom he described as an acquaintance but denied any involvement 
with drugs 
the current probe was expected to determine whether lewis was 
involved in any drug activity why the mayor was in the hotel and 
why the police officers did not search lewis hotel room until after 
he had checked out friday morning 
a spokesman for the us attorneys office would not comment on 
the report

some relatives of the 259 people killed on pan am flight 103 were 
preparing funerals when authorities confirmed a bomb blew up the 
jetliner the news although expected elicited bewilderment anger 
and calls for vengeance 
the first five bodies of americans killed in the dec 21 crash 
arrived in the united states on wednesday the day british 
investigators confirmed that a bomb had been planted on the 
frankfurt to new york flight which had stopped in london 
investigators were trying to determine who planted the bomb 
len colasanti father of 20yearold gary colasanti got the news 
while preparing for his sons funeral 
if it were an act of god it would be easier for us to accept 
said colasanti of melrose mass the fact that it was a terrorist 
act makes it much more difficult to accept garys loss 
at this point were just trying to cope with the loss of our 
son said sally pitt of south hadley mass mother of victim 
james pitt 24 that sort of thing is more than we can deal with 
after the crash us officials acknowledged that its diplomats 
had been warned of a threat to bomb a pan am airliner on the 
frankfurtnew york route in december 
i feel that every passenger on that plane should have been 
given the same warning as diplomats said susan cohen whose 
20yearold daughter theodora was among 35 students returning home 
from a syracuse university overseas program they know how to 
differentiate between safe and real threats 
in those cases where its serious security should be heavy 
mrs cohen said every piece of luggage should be inspected by 
hand why didnt they ill tell you why money 
we cannot allow greed to endanger the lives of american 
citizens my baby will never come back i will fight with every 
breath to see this never happens to another mother she said 
gheorghina vuclu whose 21yearold son peter was killed while 
heading home for the holidays from his studies in romania said she 
wasnt surprised by the finding that a bomb caused the crash 
i hope the government does something with this mess and finds 
out who did this the alliance ohio woman said i am so sorry 
for this everybody loved pete god help anybody who suffers like i 
do 
the family of 20yearold steve berrell of fargo nd said the 
confirmation of a bomb was disheartening 
although we suspected a bomb from the beginning the reality is 
overwhelming the loss of our steven by such a senseless act 
magnifies the problems that exist in our world today a family 
statement said we pray that peace and sanity will soon take over 
as the dominant words in our civilization 
ww coursey of faulkville ga whose son us army sgt w 
larry coursey was on the flight said the news didnt surprise me 
one bit 
coursey said whatever country or party is determined to be 
responsible for the bombing should be wiped out 
i hate to be hardnosed about it but thats the way i feel 
he said 
margaret evans of chattanooga tenn whose nephew william mack 
of new york city was aboard said she was angry but doesnt want 
revenge 
i dont believe in retaliation she said i think it would

in their efforts to identify the 
bombers investigators sought today to determine the type of plastic 
explosive that downed pan am flight 103 and where and how it was 
planted 
on wednesday british authorities ordered us airlines to 
toughen their security for checked baggage in light of the dec 21 
attack which claimed the lives of 259 people aboard the boeing 747 
and at least 11 local villagers 
at this point we dont have one particular lead or theory that 
we think is more promising than others state department 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said in washington we are simply 
pursuing all the leads that we have 
the investigation is known to involve scottish police the fbi 
scotland yards antiterrorist branch and federal police in west 
germany the new yorkbound flight originated in frankfurt with a 
boeing 727 
the israeli daily newspaper the nation has quoted west german 
intelligence sources as saying they believe a suspect from the 
popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command led 
by a rival of plo chairman yasser arafat named ahmed jibril boarded 
the plane in frankfurt 
the suspect carried a briefcase packed with syriansupplied 
explosives that cannot be detected by routine security methods 
the nation said 
the guerrilla left flight 103 while it was in transit in london 
leaving the briefcase behind the paper reported friday without 
elaborating 
the syrianbacked popular front became the first terrorist 
organization to bomb an airliner in flight when it blew up a tel 
avivbound swiss airliner in 1970 according to ian geldard 
director of research at the private institute for the study of 
terrorism in london fortyseven people were killed 
he said the group may have felt itself isolated from the middle 
east peace process because arafat recognized israels right to exist 
and renounced terrorism leading washington to open a dialogue with 
the plo this month 
geldard however said he considered abu nidal the top suspect 
because hes the most capable of undertaking a mission of this 
type 
abu nidal heads the fatah revolutionary council a palestinian 
faction opposed to arafats recognition of israel and talks with the 
united states the libyaallied guerrilla group has been blamed for 
dozens of hijackings bombings and assassinations since it broke 
with arafat in 1976 
on tuesday abu nidals group said from lebanon that it was 
painfully saddened by the crash 
but yonah alexander head of the institute for studies in 
international terrorism at the state university of new york said 
abu nidal does not always take responsibility for attacks for which 
his group has been blamed including a 1986 synagogue attack in 
turkey that killed 22 people and the commandeering of a pan am jumbo 
jet the day before in pakistan that left 20 people dead 
alexander said abu nidals group is believed to have easy access 
to semtex a czechoslovakmade plastic explosive that libya and 
syria possess it is lightweight odorless and the only substance 
known to have defied all detection attempts by bombsniffing dogs 
xray machines and other devices 
in announcing their finding that a bomb downed flight 103 
british authorities said wednesday that the residue of explosives 
recovered from the debris was consistent with the use of a high 
performance plastic explosive like semtex 
michael charles the chief investigator said examinations of a 
metal luggage pallet found conclusive evidence of a detonating 
high explosive 
much investigative work remains to be done to establish the 
nature of the explosive device what it was contained in its 
location in the aircraft and the sequence of events immediately 
following its detonation he said 
the jet broke apart six miles in the air and rained wreckage and 
bodies on lockerbie and the surrounding countryside one wing has 
still not been located so far 241 bodies have been found nine 
identified and released to nextofkin police spokesman angus 
kennedy said there would be no easing of the search effort which 
involved about 600 people daily 
l paul bremer who heads the state departments antiterrorism 
office said three groups have claimed responsibility for the 
attack the guardians of islamic revolution the islamic jihad and 
a group of irish protestant extremists whose name he did not have 
the investigation will concentrate principally on two airports 
in frankfurt and londons heathrow where the jumbo jet took over 
the flight 
david wilshire an aviation expert and conservative member of 
parliament said in london that the passengers on flight 103 
included a dozen who transferred from other flights feeding into 
heathrow 
the luggage of the 12 transit passengers went through the 
heathrow security system but luggage belonging to the frankfurt 
passengers did not he said 
on wednesday night britains transport department said that 
following consultations with the us federal aviation 
administration it was immediately directing us airlines to take 
additional measures in britain in particular in relation to hold 
baggage

against the japanese yen thursday in tokyo 
the dollar ended the years trading at 12603 yen up 076 yen 
from wednesdays close and up 403 yen from its 1987 yearend 
closing it had opened thursday at 12542 yen 
the tokyo stock exchange finished its last trading day of the

an exchange dealer with the bank of tokyo said the dollar 
strengthened after the market interpreted wednesdays intervention 
by the west german bundesbank as a signal of concern over 
inflation 
the bundesbank was reported to have sold about 100 million in 
support of the west german mark during wednesdays trading the 
official said speaking anonymously 
he said however that the dollar and yen were likely to remain 
around the same levels for the remainder of the year due to sparse 
staffing of dealing offices in japan and elsewhere prior to the new

palestinian extremists motivated by a desire to undermine plo 
chairman yasser arafats peace initiative are among the possible 
suspects in the downing of pan am flight 103 
perhaps no 1 on the list of suspects is abu nidal followed by a 
palestinian faction headed by a rival to arafat proiranian shiite 
moslems a group of protestant extremists in northern ireland 
terrorists opposed to us forces in europe and even mafia hitmen 
for hire terrorism experts say 
abu nidal is the top suspect because hes the most capable of 
undertaking a mission of this type said ian geldard director of 
research at the private institute for the study of terrorism in 
london 
abu nidal heads the fatah revolutionary council a palestinian 
guerrilla group opposed to arafats recognition of israel and talks 
with the united states the group allied with libya has been 
blamed for hijackings bombings and assassinations since it broke 
with arafat in 1976 
such an act of terrorism by abu nidal would be a message to the 
world that arafat cannot bring peace to the middle east its a 
message to the united states and a slap in the face for yasser 
arafat geldard said 
on tuesday abu nidals group said from beirut that it was 
painfully saddened by the dec 21 crash of flight 103 which 
originated in frankfurt west germany 
yonah alexander director of the institute for studies in 
international terrorism at the state university of new york said 
abu nidal does not always take responsibility for attacks his group 
has been blamed for including the 1986 attack on a synagogue that 
killed 22 people in istanbul turkey 
abu nidals guerrillas also were held responsible for 
commandeering a pan am jumbo jet the day before in karachi 
pakistan about 20 people were killed 
one alleged member of the group mohammed rashid is wanted by 
the united states in the 1982 bombing of a pan am jetliner flying 
from tokyo to honolulu one person was killed and 15 injured in the 
attack 
rashid 39 is serving a sevenmonth sentence for entering greece 
with a false passport greeces supreme court last month 
indefinitely postponed a decision to extradite him to the united 
states 
alexander also speculated that proiranian shiite moslem 
terrorists may have planted the bomb 
on dec 22 an anonymous caller to the associated press in london 
claimed a proiranian group called guardians of the islamic 
revolution was responsible the caller said the motive was revenge 
for the july downing of iranian jetliner in the persian gulf by the 
uss vincennes which the navy said was a case of mistaken identity 
but us officials said the group was probably was not involved 
geldard said the group has claimed responsibility for just one 
incident an attack on a leading iranian dissident in london in 
september 1987 
last week l paul bremer director of the state departments 
office of counterterrorism said callers claimed two other groups 
were responsible he said they were islamic jihad another 
proiranian shiite group and a group of protestant extremists in 
northern ireland whose name he did not have 
geldard said other palestinian suspects include the popular front 
for the liberation of palestinegeneral command led by ahmed 
jibril and the may 15th organization led by mohammad amri 
the popular front was the first terrorist organization to bomb an 
airliner in flight when it attacked a swiss airliner in 1970 he 
said fortyseven people were killed 
geldard said the group is closely associated with syria whose 
president hafez assad may feel that he has been marginalized 
from the middle east peace process 
ariel merari a senior researcher in terrorism at tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies said jibrils 
group often uses tourists and other unsuspecting carriers to plant 
its bombs 
he said a sophisticated bomb was found concealed in a radio when 
13 members of the group were detained in october in raids in west 
germany 
geldard said the may 15th organization was responsible for the 
attack on a twa airliner over the mediterranean in april 1986 that 
killed four peole and injured nine 
alexander said european terrorists including the red army 
faction may have staged the pan am attack to press their demands to 
pull us forces out of west germany 
other possibile culprits include mafia assassins recruited by 
libya or syria to perpetrate this kind of crime he said they 
use these soldiers of fortune terrorists for hire to erase any 
footsteps

whether the name gallo is a trademark or a 
legitimate name that a person can use on products was debated by 
attorneys representing rival members of the winemaking family 
an attorney for joseph gallo 67 argued wednesday that his 
client has a perfect right to label cheese he manufactures with his 
full name but an attorney for eampj gallo the worlds largest 
winery contended gallo is a trademark name that cannot be used 
without the winerys permission 
the record clearly established that the name gallo long since 
stopped being a family name and became a trademark of considerable 
significance winery counsel patrick lynch said in his closing 
argument in a trademark infringement trial the name gallo is 
virtually synonymous with a brand of wine 
the winery is owned by gallos brothers ernest 79 and julio 77 
defense counsel denis rice said if the winery wins it would be 
the only case so far as he knows where a person using his full 
name would be precluded from using it on a noncompeting 
product

controversy over beijings first exhibition of 
nude paintings has taken a new turn with models theatening to sue an 
art institute for exposing them to the public eye 
reporters for the official china youth news told the associated 
press today that two of the six nude models of the central fine arts 
institute will file suit because the institute did not obtain their 
permission to allow a publishing house to print postcards and a book 
of paintings sold at the exhibition 
the 18day exhibition at the china art gallery opened dec 22 and 
has drawn crowds of 10000 a day many of them young men willing to 
pay 10 times the usual admission price for their first look at 
officially sanctioned nude art 
the reporters said the models also stayed off the job monday a 
claim denied by an official at the fine arts institute 
chinese sources also said that the husband of one of the models 
was seeking a divorce after learning his wife had been posing in the 
nude without his knowledge another woman is also facing marital 
difficulties because of the show they said 
the painting of nudes has traditionally had a very minor role in 
chinese art history and the use of nude models was banned for a 
long time under communist chinas puritanical commissars of art 
modeling in the nude was revived in 1984 but women models have 
often been subject to social ostracism the official press earlier 
this year carried stories of a female model at the nanking institute 
of fine arts who went insane after neighbors accused her of being a 
prostitute 
the englishlanguage china daily said wednesday that one model 
for the beijing exhibition was so terrified her husband would find 
out about her secret job that she kept him away from home so he 
wouldnt see the opening day of the event on the television news 
models at the fine arts institute are paid about five times what 
an average chinese worker earns per hour 
the show 128 paintings by 21 artists has drawn high praise from 
people who say it is a breakthrough in chinese societys ability to 
differentiate art from pornography 
it has also been criticized by others who say the paintings 
appeal to the prurient interests of young chinese and are out of 
step with chinese artistic and social values

the bundesbank west germanys central bank reportedly sold 
about 100 million in support of the west german mark on wednesday 
he added

us carriers using british airports were ordered 
by the government to tighten security just hours after it announced 
that a bomb had downed pan am flight 103 over scotland 
the directive wednesday said especially close attention should be 
paid to the handling of baggage stored in aircraft cargo bays 
it was issued by the department of transport after consultation 
with the us federal aviation administration which the british 
agency said was also considering further security requirements for 
us airlines worldwide 
the decision on the same day investigators announced that a bomb 
caused the dec 21 crash of flight 103 killing all 259 people 
aboard the boeing 747 and at least 11 on the ground 
officials said evidence of the explosion believed to have been 
caused by hardtodetect plastic explosives was found in wreckage 
from a cargo hold of the new yorkbound jumbo jet 
the department of transport statement said we have reviewed 
the security arrangements for flights by us carriers in the light 
of this incident in consultation with the faa and are immediately 
directing us airlines to take additional measures in britain in 
particular in relation to hold baggage 
a spokesman who by custom was not identified refused to 
elaborate or give any details on the additional security measures it 
wants taken 
the announcement followed calls by british lawmakers and aviation 
experts for increased security following the crash britains worst 
aviation disaster 
the question that now has to be asked is how and where did a 
bomb get on board said david wilshire an aviation expert and 
lawmaker from prime minister margaret thatchers governing 
conservative party 
wilshire said there were three sources of passengers on the 
flight those who got on at frankfurt where the flight originated 
those who joined at heathrow airport and 12 in transit from other 
flights 
we are not therefore just talking about heathrow or 
frankfurt he said 
the luggage of the 12 transit passengers went through the 
heathrow security system but luggage belonging to the frankfurt 
passengers did not although it was transferred under supervision of 
pan am guards said wilshire 
opposition lawmakers have protested angrily that the department 
of transport never informed british airports or travelers about a 
us warning of a terrorist threat to bomb a pan am airliner on the 
frankfurtnew york route in december 
the government said that after receiving the threat it had 
reviewed security for us flights at british airports which 
already is higher than for some other destinations and decided it 
was adequate

two former government ministers were 
arrested today on corruption charges stemming from an investigation 
into widespread abuses under former president chun doohwan 
officials said 
government prosecutors said kim chongho the former construction 
minister was arrested on charges of taking bribes from construction 
companies in the massive urban redevelopment projects in central 
seoul 
also arrested was cha kyuhun who once served as transportation 
minister under chun cha was charged with taking bribes from 
businessmen for helping them obtain permits to build and operate 
golf courses 
prosecutors are investigating allegations of widespread 
corruption under chun including extortion of money from businesses 
diversion of government funds influence peddling and forced 
political donations the national assembly is investigating 
corruption and human rights abuses under chun 
some of chuns relatives and associates have been arrested or 
convicted of corruption but it was the first arrest of former chun 
ministers the former ministers are also exgenerals 
there have been allegations the former president collected 
illicit political donations through the licensing of golf courses 
licenses to build golf courses are highly profitable and much 
soughtafter 
chun has denied any personal corruption but has admitted he 
managed political donations 
a former general who took power with military backing in 1980 
chun went into voluntary rural exile last month after apologizing to 
the nation for abuses under his sevenyear rule which ended in 
february 
president roh taewoo a former general and once close ally of 
chun has asked the nation to forgive his disgraced predecessor roh 
opposes punishing chun but the opposition demands the former 
president appear before the national assemblys probe into his 
government 
opposition parties say they will not agree to consider a pardon 
for chun until he appears before national assembly roh says chun 
must be forgiven to promote national unity 
some opposition leaders hope nationwide furor over chun and 
revelations of abuses under his rule will hurt rohs chances of 
winning a referendum sometime next year on his rule 
roh promised to hold the referendum after the seoul olympics 
which ended in october the government is identified with chun in 
the eyes of some south koreans and roh who was elected a year ago 
when two candidates split the opposition vote faces a major 
challenge in winning the referendum 
the government has not said what roh will do if he loses the 
referendum roh would not be obliged to resign but a defeat would 
signal a lack of public confidence and the government would be under 
pressure to call elections 
no date has been set for the referendum which is expected in the 
spring

studies of nearly 29000 breastcancer patients 
leave no doubt that drug and hormone therapies improve chances of 
surviving the disease the secondleading cancer killer of american 
women researchers say 
analysis of 61 studies showed that a synthetic hormone called 
tamoxifen improves the survival of breast cancer victims over age 
50 while chemotherapy helps younger women 
during the first five years after treatment tamoxifen reduced 
the odds of death among older women by about onefifth the analysis 
revealed while a combination of chemotherapy drugs reduced the odds 
by about onequarter for younger victims 
the studies were started as far back as 20 years ago 
the analysis has established beyond reasonable doubt that both 
tamoxifen and cytotoxic chemotherapy can reduce fiveyear 
mortality the researchers wrote in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
the treatments already are widely used for women after surgery to 
remove breast tumors in most of those studied the disease had 
spread to their lymph nodes but hadnt invaded other organs 
there have been continued critics who argue that either 
chemotherapy or tamoxifen or both used early on didnt change 
survival said dr i craig henderson of the danafarber cancer 
institute in boston 
henderson one of 79 coauthors of the analysis said that while 
the treatments do not necessarily cure the cancer the review shows 
that they substantially delay death 
many of the studies in the analysis were too small to clearly 
demonstrate any effect from the treatments but after their results 
were combined the impact became apparent 
the overview method takes out the wrinkles from all the 
studies said dr nicholas robert of new england medical center 
we can use conclusions with a strong statistical foundation about 
the benefit and lack of benefit of treatments 
breast cancer is second to lung cancer as a cancer killer of 
american women an estimated 135000 new cases of breast cancer were 
diagnosed in the united states this year and 42300 women died of 
the disease 
many cancer specialists already are familiar with the findings 
since they have been presented at medical meetings during the past 
three years 
these data have already had a major impact on the way women are 
treated in this country now physicians will have the actual numbers 
in hand said another coauthor dr william wood of massachusetts 
general hospital 
the data were reviewed by a consensus panel of the national 
institutes of health before it recommended in 1985 that tamoxifen 
and chemotherapy be used for breast cancer that has spread to the 
lymph nodes 
last may the national cancer institute told doctors that the 
treatment could be extended to women in the earliest stages of 
breast cancer that is not yet evident in the lymph nodes the 
institute based its recommendation on three unpublished studies 
showing that cancer was slower to return when these women were 
treated after surgery to remove their tumors 
however that recommendation remains controversial some 
specialists contend that tamoxifen and chemotherapy should not be 
routinely given to women with very early breast cancer until there 
is proof that the treatment actually makes them live longer others 
say that even if the drugs dont lengthen survival they still may 
improve the quality of womens lives by giving them more time 
without cancer 
chemotherapy often carries unpleasant side effects such as 
nausea and hair loss tamoxifen is much milder although some women 
complain of hot flashes but its longterm effects on the body are 
not known 
many doctors are reluctant to subject all women with early breast 
cancer to these powerful medicines especially when many will remain 
free of cancer with surgery alone 
the analysis was organized by dr richard peto of oxford 
university and combined the results of 61 comparison studies 
conducted mostly in europe and north america on 28896 women the 
researchers sought out all the studies that had been conducted 
including those that found no benefit of treatment since these are 
less likely than positive studies to be published in medical 
journals 
we wanted the whole story said wood the goal was to be 
comprehensive

as part of an iranian crackdown on 
highlevel corruption a tehran court has sentenced to death for 
fraud a multimillionaire who headed an organization to help families 
of the countrys war dead 
ali mousavi of the private nabovvat foundation was also ordered 
by the court wednesday to pay 178 million to 17 creditors 
according to irans official islamic republic news agency monitored 
in nicosia 
tehrans first criminal court also convicted him of an 
illegitimate sexual act with a woman identified only as azar b 
the agency reported the couple was sentenced to 74 lashes each by 
the judge a middleranking clergyman identified as hojatoleslam 
jalal mousavi 
irna did not say if the judge was related to the defendant 
irans supreme judicial council headed by ayatollah abdulkarim 
musavi ardebili must ratify the sentence 
the crackdown on corruption which was rampant during the 8year 
war against iraq comes as the government moves to loosen social 
political and economic restrictions after the hardship and sacrifice 
of the war years 
it also is aimed partly at luring home tens of thousands of 
educated exiles whom the tehran hierarchy wants to help rebuild the 
country 
ardebili has declared repeatedly that lawlessness and the 
excesses of revolutionary police and the islamic revolutionary 
guards corps are among main obstacles preventing many of the 
estimated 2 million emigres from returning 
irans fundamentalist leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini last 
month called for a campaign to rid the people of leechlike 
elements affiliated to the government and the bazaar to end 
ripoffs and hoarding in government and private enterprises 
the agency report did not say how ali mousavi a former teacher 
made his millions 
it said he set up his supposedly nonprofit foundations several 
years ago with capital of 147000 and advertised their aim of 
providing nointerest loans and other services to the families of 
the martyrs 
soon mousavi was able not only to provide 250 million rials 
36 million in loans but to invest heavily in trade and various 
businesses worth more than 2 billion rials 2936 million irna 
noted 
it said mousavis trial which began oct 8 was a test case 
for a number of other cases involving savings and loan organizations 
that mushroomed after the islamic revolution 
irna quoted the judge as saying a lot of people thought that 
highranking officials had their hands stuck in the nabovvat 
foundation case 
but the court followed up the issue with utmost patience 
precision and fairness and praise be to god did not come up with 
anything 
but he stressed we are bound by islam and the islamic republic 
to bring any individual on key positions who god forbid is 
involved in such issues into this courtroom and deal with him 
mousavis conviction followed that of toraj mansur former 
managing director of staterun saipa co which manufactures renault 
sedans he was jailed for eight years and fined 236 million for 
embezzling 115 million 
the official media has not disclosed how effective the 
anticorruption campaign has been but the tehran daily ettelat 
noted in a recent editorial cases like saipa are not rare 
if the government does not translate into action its will to 
purge renovation will remain nothing but an ideal 
travelers from tehran including iranian businessmen have 
reported scores of cases in which revolutionary guards and officials 
of police revolutionary committees have demanded protection money 
or confiscated goods then demanded money for their return 
the corruption crackdown coincides with new moves to stamp out 
drug smuggling and abuse widespread in iran and to curb 
profiteering

moods of anger and depression have been implicated 
in chronic fatigue syndrome a debilitating weakness sometimes 
called the yuppie disease according to a report today 
it is possible that mood itself is one of the factors in the 
development of this syndrome said dr stephen e straus people 
who have certain emotional makeups may be more predisposed to get 
this syndrome than others 
doctors have searched unsuccessfully for a viral cause of the 
illness which is especially likely to afflict welloff young 
professionals a theory that it results from the epsteinbarr virus 
which causes mononucleosis has largely been abandoned 
some doctors had noticed that acyclovir a drug used against 
epsteinbarr virus seemed to relieve the syndrome the latest study 
was conducted to see if it worked 
the researchers found that those who took acyclvir frequently 
improved but so did a comparison group that received placebos 
the study found that the only factor that could clearly be linked 
to improvement was mood as peoples moods improved especially 
their feelings of anger and depression their fatigue also lessened 
straus said the latest findings do not mean that the syndrome is 
imaginary instead the symptoms may be caused by the influence of 
peoples moods on their hormones and immune defenses 
i think it is very possible that a persons psychological 
makeup could have a real impact on the expression of diseases he 
said 
he noted that people with some personality types appear to be 
less likely to survive heart attacks or cancer 
you have to ask how that would work he said its possible 
that there is a psychoimmunological or metabolic link and that may 
exist in this syndrome as well 
the latest study directed by straus at the national institute of 
allergy and infectious diseases was published in todays new 
england journal of medicine 
twentyseven adults took part in the study neither they nor the 
researchers knew whether they were getting acyclovir or dummy drugs 
of the 24 who finished the study 11 who took acyclovir and 10 who 
took placebos said they felt better 
in most of them the perception of improvement lasted two or 
three weeks after the treatment ended however four said their 
improvement lasted for at least a year three of these four had 
received placebos 
many of the patients were surprised by the studys results some 
were relieved others dismissed the findings 
straus said that some of the results are reassuring for 
instance the research found that people with the syndrome do not 
grow steadily worse instead the symptoms come and go and can 
disappear for years 
the link between mood and the syndrome is controversial the 
study does not prove that people get better because their moods 
improved in fact straus said that the opposite might be true 
it could not be determined whether their moods improved because 
they felt better or they felt better because their moods improved 
said straus both are possible 
in an accompanying editorial dr morton n swartz of 
massachusetts general hospital said its likely that the syndrome 
will prove to have mental and physical causes 
straus said that even though the illness has been formally 
recognized as a syndrome it is not new he said there are accounts 
of similar afflictions in the medical literature dating to the 1700s

hazelnut growers cant wait to get cracking on 
a new promotion to make oregon the only state with an official nut 
government and industry representatives said wednesday that 
oregons dominance in the nations hazelnut production needs more 
recognition 
oregon already has a state fish rock dance and flower and 
richard fritz an assistant director of the state agriculture 
department said lawmakers in 1989 will be asked to designate the 
hazelnut as oregons official nut 
he said oregon in 1987 produced 21000 tons of hazelnuts or 98 
percent of the domestic harvest washington state grows the rest of 
the domestic crop of hazelnuts which are also called filberts 
fritz said 
the crop generated 205 million for oregons economy last year 
and has yielded up to 38 million annually he said 
the hazelnut marketing board in portland says the state has more 
than 1100 hazelnut growers tending 32 million trees on 25000 
acres 
fritz said the designation of an official nut is likely to be the 
brunt of jokes but that will help increase recognition of the crop 
fritz said 
im sure it will bring smiles to some faces but thats what 
you want he said

while his friends fathers had medals to prove 
they had served in vietnam marty kehoes dad couldnt produce the 
goods even though he is a former marine with a distinguished 
service record in southeast asia 
but on wednesday he got the proof he needed martys father 
chicago police patrolman martin kehoe was given four ribbons and 
four medals for his service as a marine fighting in da nang and chu 
lai in 1965 and 1966 
im proud of my father said marty kehoe 14 now i know he 
was really doing something in the war 
with his wife and three children watching the elder kehoe 44 
was given the awards and a special plaque by marine lt gen charles 
pitman at a brief ceremony at ohare international airport where 
kehoe is assigned 
it really felt good to finally get them in front of the family 
with the kids being there said kehoe a 17year police veteran 
a lot of us were over there and not a lot of us were 
recognized for what went on 
col cary kelly commanding officer of the marine corps reserve 
group at glenview naval air station said kehoe should have been 
decorated by his unit soon after earning the honors but he said 
awards are sometimes put off when servicemen are in the field or on 
assignments that make ceremonies impractical 
kehoe said he mentioned the missing medals to pitman last month 
after marty jr who had been studying the vietnam war in school 
this year asked him why he didnt have any medals to prove he had 
fought there 
he was asking me about vietnam kehoe said hes got some 
friends whose dads were there and they had medals 
kehoe said he had brought up the longdelayed awards when he 
chatted with pitman in early november while on assignment 
accompanying the general at the airport 
it was just kind of like a fluke kehoe said i ran into 
this guy he was a general and he went to washington to look up my 
record and he was nice enough to come back and give the awards to 
me 
pitman said that while he does not normally deal with such 
matters he was touched by kehoes story about his son 
he had a good record pitman said he was a good marine a 
fine guy who served his country well and were proud to honor him 
i know his son certainly appreciated it 
pitman the marines deputy chief of staff for aviation in 
washington said such delays were not unusual 
we still get requests for verification of awards from world war 
ii and the korean war he said 
pitman said he gave kehoe who was a corporal when he left active 
duty the combat action ribbon the meritorious unit citation the 
good conduct medal the vietnam service medal the national defense 
service medal the presidential unit citation the vietnamese 
campaign medal and a vietnamese unit citation

city officials appealed today for an end to 
the daily antiblack demonstrations that have followed a christmas 
eve fight between african students and chinese the embattled 
africans remained sequestered 
two foreign reporters were barred from talking with the roughly 
140 african students who were being held under virtual house arrest 
in a guest house 1 hours by car outside this eastcentral city 
the africans accompanied by students from pakistan nepal 
bangladesh japan and western europe were not allowed to make 
telephone calls or leave the guest house other than to return to 
their universities in nanking 
chinese police forced virtually all of nankings black african 
students to the guest house monday after thousands of chinese 
marched through the citys streets throwing rocks and destroying 
property at the african students dormitories 
the chinese youth chanted down with black devils and black 
devils go home 
the africans fearing for their lives tried to leave for 
beijing but were stopped sunday by armed police at nankings train 
station 
the clash and demonstrations are the latest in a series of 
incidents between chinese and the 1500 african students invited 
here to show beijings solidarity with the third world 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing asked in beijing whether 
nanking authorities had the right to hold the african students 
called groundless charges that the africans were being held 
illegally 
li added the incident that has occurred in nanking is an 
isolated one having nothing to do with racial discrimination 
he said students from 40 african nations are studying in china 
and they always get on quite well with the chinese students of 
course because of the difference of the customs of life it is 
sometimes unavoidable for some misunderstanding and even something 
unpleasant 
today the only african student to leave the guest house and 
return to nanking said he wanted to leave china as soon as possible 
i am very fearful said a 23yearold from comoros who 
identified himself only as bourhane in an interview in his dormitory 
at nanking polytechnical institute i wont leave this building 
even seeing a chinese outside the window makes me cold with fright 
in a frontpage editorial the xinhua daily nankings largest 
newspaper urged students to stop demonstrating students youths 
and workers have been marching by the thousands since the saturday 
night fight between chinese officials and students who refused to 
register the names of their chinese female companions they were 
taking to a campus party 
eleven chinese were reported injured including one critically 
on wednesday more than 2000 youths jammed a major city 
intersection as hundreds of police gathered nearby riot police 
charged the crowd sporadically hitting youths with rubber 
truncheons 
other police placed demonstrators in an unmarked van 
american witnesses said protests earlier this week were highly 
racist in nature with chinese yelling kill the black devils 
in demonstrations tuesday and wednesday night however chinese 
began calling on the government to punish those involved in the 
fight according to the law 
in the beginning it was down with the black devils but were 
not calling for that said lin min a 23yearold nanking 
university student we want matters to be settled according to 
law 
at the guest house at a chemical fiber factory to the northwest 
chinese officials refused to let western reporters talk with the 
students

wilson said at a meeting wednesday night in which the boston school 
committee endorsed 101 the new student assignment plan in 
principle two committee members did not vote 
the panel stopped short of full approval it ordered wilson to 
complete a review of the plan which was devised by consultants and 
develop ways to put it into effect at least in part by september 
the plan would split the school system into three zones of 14000 
parents each with parents permitted to choose any school in their 
zone students would be allowed to go to the school unless the 
racial balance was upset if a school was oversubscribed a lottery 
would be held said school committee president john nucci 
backers say the plan would cut the long bus rides many students 
now endure they also hope the resulting interschool competition 
will spur improvements and lure back whites who fled to private 
schools or the suburbs when the desegregation order was imposed in 
1974 
critics say the plan wont work without more money and that it 
would hurt some people such as those without access to special 
magnet schools boston school woes include rundown buildings a 
perennial budget crunch and a 40 percent highschool dropout rate 
nowhere in this plan do i see a commitment from this city to 
pay for choice said jean mcguire one of the two abstaining 
committee members 
nucci said he doesnt believe money will make or break the plan 
the 1974 desegregation order by us district judge w arthur 
garrity jr stemmed from a 1972 lawsuit filed by black parents who 
said their children were receiving lower quality education than that 
at predominantly white schools 
in 1975 garrity imposed the busing plan triggering 
rockthrowing protests 
weve put that kind of violence and racial strain behind us 
committeeman john p grady said we want all of our children to 
have the best education we can give them as a city weve grown 
up 
when the lawsuit was filed public schools served 96000 
students 60 percent white today there are 59000 students but 
only 24 percent are white although whites comprise 60 percent of 
bostons population fortyeight percent of students are black 19 
percent are hispanic and 8 percent are asian 
as a result some schools effectively have been resegregated and 
nearly 90 percent of their pupils belong to minority groups grady 
said 
garrity returned some control of the system to the committee in 
1985 two years later a federal appeals court ruled that boston 
schools had integrated and that increased minority influence would 
prevent a return to segregated classrooms 
garrity has since left the bench his orders require only that a 
racial balance be maintained freeing the committee to come up with 
a plan of its own 
any change in the student assignment plan would require approval 
by the state board of education 
mayor raymond l flynn who once was a fervent busing foe 
supports the plan he has said that schools could tap into existing 
funds to help fund it 
wilson said he did not know how much the new plan might cost but 
said he expected there would be a request for funds

social security officials say a quadriplegic 
who won a seat in the legislature has been warned he could lose his 
medical benefits if he takes his newly won seat and begins drawing 
expense reimbursements 
bill boharski a kalispell republican defeated democrat gordon 
hall in november to win his first term in the montana house 
but after drawing expense reimbursements for attending 
legislative caucuses in november boharski said he was notified the 
reimbursements were unearned income that would make him 
ineligible for continued medical benefits under medicare and 
medicaid 
and boharski who is paralyzed from injuries he suffered in an 
automobile accident five years ago says he cant afford to lose the 
money he estimates his medical expenses at 15000 a year 
that put me in a position where i had to seriously consider 
whether or not i had to resign my position the 27yearold 
legislatorelect said that amount of medical bills isnt 
something you can just pay 
boharski said the situation is not desperate because state and 
federal officials are trying to help 
legislative leaders say theyre considering a change in state 
compensation law to redefine the reimbursements and boharski said 
social security has advised him the case is under review boharski 
also said he will ask congress for help if need be 
montana legislators earn 5213 for each working day in the 
session plus 50 a day during the session as reimbursement for 
living expenses in helena the 1989 session begins monday 
its the expense reimbursement that concerns social security 
administration officials 
mark fredenberg operations supervisor for the agencys kalispell 
office said that under federal law the expense allowances are 
considered unearned income 
social security disability benefits are reduced by the amount of 
unearned income over 20 that a person receives he said and a 
person who loses eligibility for those payments because of unearned 
income also loses eligibility for medical coverage he said 
most people receiving disability payments dont work or dont 
travel to work fredenberg noted saying a situation such as 
boharskis arises very very seldom 
boharski said he checked into the federal regulations before he 
filed for office last spring he said he was told then he would 
qualify for continued medical benefits if elected under a program 
that allows people to continue receiving medical coverage even if 
they are working 
boharski said social security officials have since told him he 
should be able to continue receiving his medical benefits but he 
said he hasnt yet received written verification fredenberg said 
he could not comment directly on boharskis case because of federal 
privacy laws 
boharski said if legislation at the state level doesnt resolve 
the problem he will try to have changes made at the federal level 
so he can retain his legislative seat 
im counting on staying he said anyone who knows me knows 
i dont quit that easy

president mikhail s gorbachev and a close 
confidant approved a trip to armenia and azerbaijan by andrei 
sakharov to seek a compromise in the republics bitter ethnic 
dispute the human rights activists wife said today 
yelena bonner said in a telephone interview that she and her 
husband winner of the 1975 nobel peace prize were in a fivemember 
delegation that visited the capitals of the southern republics and 
stepanakert the largest city in the region at the center of the 
dispute 
she said the group returned to moscow on monday and may make 
another trip to the region which has been wracked by 10 months of 
violence armenia demands annexation of nagornokarabakh a 
predominantly armenian enclave in azerbaijan 
bonner said the mission had the backing of gorbachev and 
alexander yakovlev the member of the ruling politburo considered 
closest to gorbachev 
asked whether the officials or sakharov a 67yearold nuclear 
physicist proposed the mission and how the leaders had expressed 
their backing bonner said if he wanted to publicize this he 
would 
gorbachevs approval of the sakharov mission however is further 
evidence of the gaining official stature of a man exiled to the 
closed city of gorky in 1980 for criticizing the soviet intervention 
in afghanistan 
in december 1986 gorbachev telephoned sakharov and said he could 
return to moscow sakharov was restored to good graces at the 
academy of sciences and has been quoted frequently in the official 
press 
bonner declined to say who the group met with during its trip or 
what was discussed 
the mission was aimed at resolving a protracted dispute over 
control of nagornokarabakh the district has been part of 
predominantly moslem azerbaijan since 1923 armenians who are 
mostly christian insist that the region should be annexed to the 
armenian republic 
the central government has refused to side with the armenians 
and strikes riots and demonstrations have plagued both republics 
since february 
gorbachev has said the dispute threatens his reform effots and 
has expressed anger at activists who continually raise the issue 
during a visit to the united states earlier this month sakharov 
proposed a compromise he recommended that nagornokarabhk be taken 
out of azerbaijani hands and placed temporarily under a central 
administration sakharov has also called for un observers to 
investigate the ethnic unrest 
in the armenian capital of yerevan vigen sarkisyan a journalist 
for the communist party newspaper kommunist said sakharov tried 
to find compromises in a meeting with armenian scientists at their 
academy of sciences none of the scientists familiar with the 
meeting was available today said an academy secretary 
rafael popoyan a former armenian political prisoner and literary 
critic said by telephone from yerevan that sakharov also visited a 
center for armenians who fled azerbaijan because of violence in 
connection with the territorial dispute at least 60 people have 
been killed 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov asked about the 
trip wednesday said as far as i know he went there as a member 
of a group of academics and scholars that trip had nothing to do 
with any authority whatsoever 
in nagornokarabakh the group met with the kremlins negotiator 
in the ethnic dispute arkady volsky according to popoyan 
it appeared the groups ostensible reason for visiting the region 
was to review conditions at a controversial nuclear power plant near 
yerevan popoyan said the soviet leadership has asked the academy 
of sciences to study the power station 
many armenians feared the plant was damaged in the dec 7 
earthquake which claimed about 55000 lives and left a half million 
people homeless 
soviet officials have repeatedly said the plant which is built 
on a fault was not damaged nevertheless premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov says it will be closed in two years because of the 
earthquake danger

some say bucky is mutt others say its a 
super pit bull a judges decision on the matter ultimately 
could cost the dog its life under the states new antiviciousdog 
law 
lucas county dog warden thomas skeldon said wednesday that bucky 
apparently is a super pit bull part pit bull part rhodesian 
ridgeback making it extremely dangerous 
a rhodesian ridgeback is known as an african lion hound because 
of its ability to hunt lions skeldon said bucky he said has the 
aggressiveness of a ridgeback and the tenacity of a pit bull 
skeldon said mixed breeding is on the rise because some people 
see it as a way of circumventing ohios new viciousdog law which 
was passed in 1987 after a daytonarea doctor was fatally attacked 
by two pit bulls the law singles out only pit bulls 
we can foresee larger pit bulls coming into the pound and pit 
bull crosses with larger breeds weve never seen one this large 
before skeldon said about bucky who weighs about 90 pounds 
we hear theres an attempt to cross pit bulls with breeds so 
that it doesnt look like a pit bull and there also is the tendency 
to breed the dog with a larger animal this is frightening he 
said 
county deputy dog wardens on dec 15 confiscated bucky who is 
licensed after the dog was seen running loose from its yard which 
had an open gate 
ron cannon a deputy dog warden said the pound was notified by 
the us postal service which complained that the dog chased one a 
letter carrier who had to use a spray deterrent to keep the dog at 
bay 
the owner amy adkins was cited for having a vicious dog 
improperly confined and for having no liability insurance 
her attorney christopher park disputes skeldons contentions 
that bucky is a pit bull 
it is my understanding that it is not a pit bull i know the 
owners say it isnt he said 
he said talking about the case would be premature because of a 
jan 12 pretrial conference in municipal court 
if a judge determines the dog is a pit bull he can order it 
destroyed 
the previous attack classifies bucky as a dangerous dog under the 
law but the question remains whether he is a pit bull the only 
breed listed in the state statue as a vicious dog 
penalities for violations involving dangerous dogs and vicious 
dogs are similar but the law requires the owner of a vicious dog to 
carry proof of liability insurance which is often difficult to 
obtain 
skeldon said he thinks the dog is a threat to the public 
i am willing to euthanize the dog if thats the case but if i 
am told by the court to return the dog to its owners i will comply 
with that also he said

prime minister noboru takeshita said today that he 
would keep his new justice minister despite the mans history of 
donations from a company at the center of a stock scandal that 
reaches deep into japanese politics 
opposition parties demanded the resignation of takashi hasegawa 
because he has admitted receiving donations for 12 years from 
recruit co which his office is probing for suspected bribery 
hasegawa was named to the justice portfolio on tuesday as 
takeshita reshuffled his cabinet and launched an ethics reform drive 
in a bid to put the recruit scandal behind him 
but takeshitas attempts to restore confidence in his government 
seemed to be falling apart wednesday night when the justice minister 
confirmed he had taken money from recruit 
takeshita after consulting leaders of his liberal democratic 
party said he would keep hasegawa even though the new justice 
minister had not been prudent in accepting the donations 
but i fully trust that his ability will allow him to fulfill 
his responsibility as justice minister takeshita said 
hasegawa 76 told a news conference this afternoon he had 
learned only wednesday that recruit co had been paying membership 
dues since 1976 in an organization called hakusenkai which helps 
finance hasegawas campaign and political activities 
he said it was truly careless of him not to have known about 
the donations and he apologized 
but he continued as justice minister i dont think this 
matter will be an impediment accordingly i will carry out my 
duties as justice minister in the future 
hasegawa had told reporters tuesday he had no links to the 
recruit co and thats why i can appear before you as the new 
justice minister 
but news reports wednesday night said recruit had been giving 
money to hasegawa for 12 years and that the last donation had been 
in october when the recruit scandal was frontpage news every day 
the donations totaled 46000 
the donations were legal and quite different from the 
transactions in shares of a recruit subsidiary called recruitcosmos 
that so far have brought the resignations of 17 politicians and 
businessmen 
hasegawa told a latenight news conference wednesday that he had 
asked his aides including his son akira whether they had received 
recruitcosmos shares and when they said no he felt able to take 
the justice portfolio but he said he hadnt asked whether recruit 
had given him political donations 
mitsuhiro kaneko head of the japan communist partys 
secretariat told a news conference that hasegawa should resign and 
the prime ministers responsibility in appointing him should not 
be escaped as well 
leaders of the socialist party the democratic socialist party 
and the komeito clean government party said hasegawa was 
inappropriate to serve as justice minister 
prosecutors have questioned recruit founder hiromasa ezoe as well 
as officials of nippon telegraph and telephone co japans giant 
telephone utility about business links between recruit and the 
utility 
the scandal has been developing since last summer when it 
emerged that ezoe had sold bargainpriced shares in recruitcosmos 
to influential politicians and business figures before the shares 
were listed 
another recruit subsidiary gave interestfree loans to finance 
some of the transactions and when the shares were listed in 1986 
the price rose sharply and the shareholders made hefty profits 
the sales were not illegal under the securities law but they 
appeared to be ethically dubious ways for a company to give 
donations above the limit of one million yen 8000 a year if not 
bribes to have the officials give advantages to recruit a huge 
conglomerate based on employment services 
the recruitcosmos subsidiary deals in real estate 
some of the shareholders made over 80000 in taxfree profits 
heading the list of those who have resigned in the scandal is 
exfinance minister kiichi miyazawa who repeatedly changed his 
story of how an aide had used miyazawas name to buy recruitcosmos 
shares his dec 9 resignation was interpreted as a sacrifice by 
takeshita 
the most prominent casualty in the business world is hisashi 
shinto who resigned as chairman of nippon telegraph and telephone 
on dec 14 he had denied any involvement in an aides purchase of 
shares but some of money from the eventual sale went into shintos 
personal bank account

sudans main international airport and 
seaport were idled and its key cities paralyzed today by a general 
strike in protest of the governmentdecreed price hikes in basic 
commodities 
telephone and telex operators in cairo egypt said all lines to 
khartoum were out of order indicating telecommunications workers 
had made good their threat to join the strike and cut sudans links 
with the outside 
prime minister sadek mahdi called an emergency cabinet meeting 
for today and hinted he might give in to the strikers demands 
meanwhile the governing coalitions junior partner the 
democratic unionist party quit the government wednesday in sympathy 
with the strikers the unionists dominate the powerful 
2millionmember sudan workers trade union federation which called 
the strike 
the unionists had been under grassroots pressure for some time 
to quit the government because it failed to follow through with a 
plan party leader mohammed osman mirghani negotiated to end a 
5year civil war in the south 
mirghani handed mahdi resignations of the six unionist cabinet 
members including foreign minister hussein suleiman salih 
in a statement the unionists called for a national 
reconciliation government to roll back the price increases 
implement the peace agreement and prepare for elections 
cairos middle east news agency said mahdi had called on the 
sudanese not to engage in destruction and rioting adding the 
democratic system is capable through its institutions to take 
decisions then study them and reform them if necessary through 
democratic means 
on monday mahdis financially strapped government increased the 
price of sugar by 600 percent and cigarettes by 50 percent and 
levied a 15 percent sales tax on all commodities 
ministers explained the increases were to finance subsidies as 
well as salary increases of 50 percent to 500 percent decreed two 
days earlier for public and private employees the edict covered 1 
million government workers 
newspapers and the official sudan news agency reported that many 
of the countrys major cities were at a standstill today 
reports from port sudan the principal red sea port said a 
strike began last saturday and that police had arrested several 
people the shutdown apparently was to protest the governments 
alleged reneging on a promise to make pay increases retroactive to 
july 1 they were made effective dec 1 
on wednesday all union workers at khartoum international airport 
left their posts 
officials in cairo said flights that normally crossed sudanese 
airspace were being rerouted because of the lack of communications 
with khartoum air traffic controllers 
other major central sudan towns dongola atbara wad medani and 
sennar were reported in complete paralysis because of the work 
stoppage 
the general strike took hold after two days of demonstrations in 
the capital thousands remained on the streets wednesday night one 
group as it passed the ministry of information shouted the head 
of the prime minister is a public demand 
similar unrest in march 1985 ended the 16year authoritarian rule 
of president gaafar nimeiri his defense minister led a coup in 
early april that began a process leading to the return of civilian 
rule a year later

jewish cemeteries in the soviet union will be 
preserved and visitors will have greater access to historical and 
religious documents under a new agreement a jewish activist says 
the soviets have gone out of their way to work with us to 
preserve many of the traditions that exist in the soviet union 
city councilman noach dear said wednesday a day after his return 
from moscow 
many jewish leaders are buried in the soviet union including the 
founder of hasidism rabbi israel ben eliezer or the baal shem 
tov who is buried in the ukrainian town of medzhibozh said dear 
cochair of the private joint committee for the preservation of 
jewish heritage in the soviet union 
the history of the jews is basically in the soviet union at the 
present time said dear 
under the agreement with soviet officials cities and historical 
sites that had been closed to outsiders would be opened to jews from 
around the world dear announced wednesday 
the soviets also agreed to assist visitors and preserve jewish 
grave sites and historical documents dear said 
he said the agreement also would help keep jewish life alive in 
the soviet union as outsiders visit the burial sites and give a 
little life to the jewish community that exists in many of these 
cities and towns which probably have never seen outside jewish 
leaders 
dear said many jewish cemeteries and grave sites are in poor 
condition and that members of the committee would return soon to the 
soviet union to catalogue the sites 
these are significant steps in a world that was closed off to 
us said committee cochair aaron d twerski as the doors open 
up and as their attitudes become more positive we will be pressing 
for additional rights for soviet jews 
another sign of improvement in the way jews are treated under 
soviet president mikhail gorbachevs reforms is increased soviet 
jewish emigration in november 2284 jews left the soviet union 
slightly lower than the 2480 figure for october that marked the 
highest monthly total since 1980 but still a high level soviet 
authorities also have loosened restrictions on the teaching of 
hebrew and are planning a jewish cultural center in moscow

two sons of a cattle rancher who 
favored clearing the amazon for grazing have been arrested in 
connection with the killing of an ecologist who fought to preserve 
the jungle police say 
brothers aleci and oloci alves da silva were captured after a gun 
battle with police tuesday night on their family ranch in xapuri 
the jungle town where francisco mendes was gunned down last week 
deputy minister of justice luis fernando eichenberg said oloci was 
wounded in the shootout 
the two are sons of darly alves da silva a rancher who was angry 
over mendes campaign to save the rain forest mendes had said the 
rancher threatened to kill him 
the internationally known ecologist who organized jungle workers 
to try to stop destruction of the rain forest by plantation owners 
was fatally shot thursday outside his home in xapuri 2650 miles 
northwest of rio de janeiro 
the issue of how to develop the amazon jungle an expanse of rain 
forest about twothirds the size of the continental united states 
has often erupted in violent conflicts between landowners landless 
peasants politicians clergymen and ecologists who defend the 
peasants 
in brazil about 4 percent of the population owns half of the 
arable land 
cattle ranchers eager to clear forest lands for grazing often 
order the killings of squatters and ecologists who oppose them 
some experts say uncontrolled burning of the amazon is 
aggravating the greenhouse effect atmospheric warming caused by 
the buildup of carbon dioxide 
federal police were still looking for five other members of the 
ranchers family in connection with mendes death eichenberg said 
a third son 21yearold darcy pereira turned himself in to 
police monday and claimed he hired someone to kill mendes officials 
said they did not believe the confession 
our impression is that darcys confession is a smoke screen 
said eichenberg we wont stop our search until we get to his 
boss 
on wednesday police began a 48hour operation to confiscate 
illegal weapons in the region in an effort to halt widespread 
violence in the western amazon 
two years ago federal police carried out a similar campaign in 
the parrots beak region of brazil a rural area 1800 miles north 
of rio torn by land disputes 
they set up roadblocks searched vehicles raided ranches and 
confiscated hundreds of unregistered arms but the violence 
continued unchecked 
violent conflicts over land have increased since president jose 
sarney the first civilian president since a 21year military regime 
ended in 1985 announced a sweeping agrarian reform program 
since 1985 about 250 deaths a year have resulted from land 
conflicts in 1971 just 20 people were killed in 109 battles 
according to government figures

the agriculture department is considering new 
federal labeling and processing rules to ensure that certain kinds 
of meat patties including precooked hamburgers are safe to eat 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food safety 
and inspection service said there has been increasing evidence 
over the past several years that disease organisms survive in 
products that many consumers erroneously believe are fully cooked 
when bought 
the proposal would affect fully cooked partially cooked and 
charmarked ground meat patties 
crawford said examples include such items as charbroiled beef 
patties and prebrowned fresh pork sausage patties 
as these types of covenenience products continue to become more 
popular we must establish requirements to reduce the potential for 
foodborne illnesses he said 
recently crawford said a strain of bacteria escherichia coli 
was linked to an outbreak of food poisoning which hospitalized six 
minnesota school children with severe diarrhea and cramps 
crawford said the centers for disease control determined that 
undercooked beef patties caused the illness although the specific 
strain of bacteria that infected the children has not been isolated 
from the patties 
the proposed rule would establish requirements for the storage of 
raw ingredients processing times and temperatures handling to 
prevent contamination after processing and labels that include 
cooking instruction for final preparation 
for example he said the partially cooked ground meat patties 
would bear the label statement partially cooked for safety cook 
until well done internal temperature of 160 f 
public comments on the proposal can be sent by jan 27 to policy

military base spokesmen today reacted with a stiff upper lip to a 
government commissions costcutting proposal to close 86 bases 
nationwide but civilians decried the effects the closings would 
have on their economies 
politicians declared victory in areas where bases were spared by 
the measure which would save an estimated 56 billion over 20 
years 
were not going to fight with anybody its not our decision 
things are going to fall where theyre going to fall said lt 
col ron yacovelli a spokesman for fort sheridan outside chicago 
fort sheridan serves as headquarters for the 4th us army which 
includes reservists in illinois indiana ohio michigan wisconsin 
iowa and minnesota it employs about 1500 civilians and 1500 
military personnel 
the decision has been made and like any decision well press 
on and carry it out said maj dave sutherlin a spokesman for 
chanute base about 15 miles north of champaign ill i want to 
stress that its only a recommendation were not going to shut 
our gates tomorrow 
the base employs about 7000 people in rantoul a town of 20000 
plans to shut down the presidio in san francisco where the sixth 
army is headquartered was a surprise to mayor art agnos office 
what we heard was that it will close partially said mayoral 
spokeswoman eileen maloney she said the announcement will have to 
be studied and run through a number cruncher before the mayor 
would be ready to comment on what it means to the city in terms of 
lost jobs and money 
it will depend i guess on how many people will be gored by 
this she said were not pleased its closing agnos has 
already signed onto the committee to save the presidio 
in addition to the complete closure of 86 bases 59 others were 
slated for partial closing or realignment 
among those was fort dix new jerseys largest military base the 
panel recommended that it be reduced to semiactive status for 
an annual savings of 845 million the base now one of the armys 
eight basictraining posts would lose that function entirely 
the announcement was bad news for the pemberton township board of 
education whose schools are attended by children of fort dixs 
military personnel 
mark cowell business administrator for the district said 
children of base personnel comprise 38 percent of its student body 
we are in the middle of adding an addition to our high school 
because they have been expanding the base he said 
a historic fort built to protect stagecoach travelers from indian 
attack also fell under the ax fort douglas built in 1862 in the 
foothills of utahs wasatch mountains had long been criticized by 
congressional foes as contributing little to national defense 
im sure theres going to be people disappointed who work 
here said army maj bill auer the forts spokesman one of the 
things we have to contend with is 44 of our buildings here are also 
registered national historic landmarks 
not all the news from the report was bad several communities 
were elated by the panels recommendation to expand several 
facilities 
sen strom thurmond rsc welcomed the proposal to add 661 
military and 126 civilian personnel at fort jackson the army base 
in columbia 
fort jackson is one of our nations finest and most vital 
military training facilities and i am enthusiastic about the 
increase of its role in providing for our nations defense he 
said 
although the commission report spelled doom for the philadelphia 
naval hospital which the navy had long anticipated closing the 
announcement brought relief to supporters of the philadelphia naval 
shipyard 
we won said us rep thomas foglietta standing with 
workers at the gate of the navy base and shipyard which employs 
about 8500 people 
we are going to stay open he said i am happy in fact i 
am thrilled the philadelphia naval base and naval shipyard is not on 
the list of defense facilities that are to be closed around the 
country the workers won this is their victory 
residents of ayer mass site of fort devens new englands only 
army base also rejoiced at being spared 
its the best news we could have for a new years said ed 
kelley owner of a local card shop and a director of the towns 
chamber of commerce its the life and blood of the town it would 
have been devastating if fort devens had been closed

a top armenian official on thursday dismissed the 
mediation effort by human rights activist andrei d sakharov in the 
bloody caucasus ethnic dispute saying authorities can settle the 
matter on their own 
i think we have sufficient help and advice from the government 
and party on the karabakh issue said vardges artsruny a deputy 
premier of the armenian republic when asked if officials welcomed 
sakharovs mission 
sakharov a 67yearold physicist and nobel peace prize winner 
returned monday from a trip to armenia and the neighboring republic 
with which it is feuding azerbaijan armenians familiar with the 
mission said it was aimed at seeking a compromise in the 
10monthold rift over control of nagornokarabakh 
armenians began strikes and demonstrations in february to press 
their demand that the territory part of azerbaijan since 1923 be 
incorporated into the armenian republic azerbaijanis have refused 
to cede the district and moscow authorities have sided with them 
clashes between armenians and azerbaijanis over the dispute have 
left at least 60 people dead 
bonner who accompanied sakharov on the trip with three other 
people she declined to identify said president mikhail s gorbachev 
and his closest ally alexander yakovlev a member of the ruling 
politburo had approved the trip 
she said the group visited the armenian capital of yerevan the 
azerbaijani capital of baku and stepanakert the main city of 
nagornokarabakh but declined to say whom they met or exactly what 
they discussed 
asked whether the officials or sakharov proposed the mission and 
how the leaders had expressed their backing bonner said if he 
wanted to publicize this he would 
artsruny the deputy premier was asked about the sakharov 
mission in a television hookup in which moscowbased reporters put 
questions to armenian officials in yerevan he said sakharovs help 
was not needed and then lashed out at journalists who raised the 
nagornokarabakh issue while armenia was suffering from the dec 7 
earthquake 
another deputy premier yuri hojamiryan said he met with 
sakharov in yerevan but that they only discussed earthquake relief 
efforts not the ethnic dispute 
also in the news conference armenias interior minister usik 
arutunyan said his forces had restored order to the republic and 
that there had been no conflicts stemming from racism recently 
authorities imposed a dusktodawn curfew and sent tanks and 
troops into many parts of armenia and azerbaijan late last month to 
quell ethnic unrest several armenian political activists have been 
arrested 
gorbachev has said the ethnic dispute threatens his reform 
program known as perestroika and has expressed anger at activists 
who continually raise the issue 
during a visit to the united states earlier this month sakharov 
recommended the disputed territory be taken out of azerbaijans 
hands and placed temporarily under a central administration 
sakharov also called for united nations observers to investigate the 
ethnic unrest 
gorbachevs approval of the mission reflects sakharovs improving 
official standing 
sakharov won the nobel peace prize in 1975 for his human rights 
campaigning but was exiled to the city of gorky in 1980 for 
criticizing the soviet intervention in afghanistan in december 
1986 gorbachev telephoned sakharov and said he could return to 
moscow he was restored to good graces at the academy of sciences 
and has been quoted frequently in the press

prime minister benazir bhutto had her 
first meeting with prime minister rajiv gandhi of india on thursday 
and urged her fellow south asian leaders to spend less money on 
weapons and more on fighting disease and poverty 
ms bhutto assumed the chairmanship of the south asian 
association for regional cooperation and opened the first session of 
the sevennation summit then met with the leader of the nation that 
has long been her countrys bitter rival 
less than a month after pakistans first free elections in 11 
years propelled her into the prime ministers job and made her the 
first woman leader of a modern moslem nation ms bhutto used the 
summit to call for a reassessment of priorities in the impoverished 
asian subcontinent 
some of us are spending too great a proportion of our national 
resources on defense maintaining large military forces that face 
each other ms bhutto said speaking in english with an accent 
that reflects both her harvard and oxford educations 
ms bhutto whose country spends almost 40 percent of its budget 
on defense added the truth is that our people face the same 
common problems the problems of poverty disease slums ignorance 
and unemployment and it is to the vanquishing of these enemies 
that we should direct all our efforts 
gandhi in his speech at the opening session in the auditorium of 
the state bank building also spoke of the need to translate the 
groups scores of seminars and study groups into concrete action 
in each of our countries the highest priority is the war on 
poverty gandhi said until we make the south asian association 
for regional cooperation a peoples movement its achievements will 
lie recorded only in dusty files or molder in the cabinets of our 
bureaucracies 
we have not taken even one full step down the road towards 
regional cooperation of a kind which interfaces with our people on 
development issues at the grassroots ghe said 
ms bhutto urged fellow members to seek regional solutions for 
curbing the arms race and the danger of nuclear proliferation of 
war 
indias nuclear weapons program and pakistans ability to 
manufacture nuclear arms have been a major obstacle to friendlier 
relations between the two countries 
moslem pakistan has fought three wars with predominantly hindu 
india since 1947 when the two nations were created through 
partition along religious lines out of the british colonial india 
ms bhutto chatted occasionally with gandhi while seated on the 
platform at the 2hour opening session of the fourth annual summit 
she saw him privately afterward and two more private sessions are 
scheduled friday and saturday 
their meeting has eclipsed the presence of the five other 
leaders president hussain muhammad ershad of bangladesh king jigme 
singhe wangchuk of bhutan president maumoon abdul gayoom of the 
maldives king birendra of nepal and president junius r jayewardene 
of sri lanka 
but the summit by providing a venue for gandhi and ms bhutto to 
get to know each other has prompted hopes that this new generation 
of indian and pakistani leaders can transcend the bitter memories of 
their nations intertwined histories 
gandhi 44 took office in 1984 after the assassination of his 
mother prime minister indira gandhi ms bhutto 35 led her 
pakistan peoples party to an electoral triumph in last months 
parliament elections on dec 2 she was sworn in as prime minister 
a post held by her father prime minister zulkifar ali bhutto who 
was ousted in a military coup in 1977 and later executed 
india with 880 million people and pakistan with 107 million 
are the mightiest military and political powers of the nations 
which have a combined population of 11 billion

a government commission today proposed closing 
partially closing or changing the missions of 145 military bases or 
installations for savings of 693 million a year 
the commission on base realignment and closure called for closing 
86 installations including 52 military housing units five more 
installations would be partially closed and 54 others would get new 
missions and additional personnel 
if defense secretary frank c carlucci accepts the commissions 
recommendations congress will have to either accept them all or 
reject them all under the procedure it enacted congress 
historically reluctant to close bases cannot spare some of the 
facilities while letting others close 
under a formula taking into account future inflationary costs and 
other factors the commission estimated savings would amount to 56 
billion over a 20year period that would amount to a minuscule part 
of defense costs the pentagons budget runs now at about 300 
billion a year 
my initial impression is favorable my general feeling is that 
this will be well received by the congress said sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the senate armed services committee 
he said the odds are heavily in favor of the recommendations 
taking effect 
the recommended changes reflect an opportunity to improve the 
nations defense position said abraham ribicoff a former 
democratic senator from connecticut who headed a commission which 
presented the list of recommended changes at a pentagon news 
conference this morning 
cochairman jack edwards a former republican congressman from 
alabama said the panel used improvement in military value of our 
domestic base structure as the preeminent consideration 
our report presents an opportunity to reduce training costs in 
terms of manpower overhead costs and fuel to improve command and 
control consolidate training and improve economies of scale and to 
remove unnecessary administrative burdens to our defense managers 
said edwards 
despite these improvements we do not anticipate any 
substantial socioeconomic disruption to the communities that are 
closely linked to the bases that are recommended for closure said 
edwards 
the largest affected bases were five air force bases chanute in 
illinois george mather and norton in california and pease in new 
hampshire all recommended for closing plus three army 
installations fort dix in new jersey to partially close fort 
sheridan in illinois the presidio in downtown san francisco to 
close and fort dix in new jersey to partially close and one naval 
installation the philadelphia naval hospital to close 
other important bases that would be affected are fort meade md 
to partially close and the jefferson proving ground in indiana to 
close 
a naval station at hunters point san francisco would not be 
built several facilities will gain personnel from the changes 
including the yuma proving ground in arizona fort devens mass 
and the naval station at pearl harbor hawaii 
the news came as a blow to several communities but others that 
were spared exulted 
we won said pennsylvania rep thomas foglietta standing 
with workers at the gate of the philadelphia naval shipyard which 
employs about 8500 people we are going to stay open he said 
implementation of the recommendations would follow a complex 
procedure involving defense secretary frank c carlucci both houses 
of congress and george bush after he becomes president on jan 20 
the process which requires that the whole package of proposals 
be either accepted or rejected is designed to withstand political 
pressure from congressmen trying to protect bases in their districts 
former missouri sen tom eagleton a commission member 
complained that the armed services especially the navy had impeded 
the panels work 
the air force ultimately gave its cooperation eagleton said 
in an additional view at the close of the 88page final report 
the army begrudgingly gave its reluctant cooperation the navy 
stonewalled and got away with it eagletons statement said 
intransigence paid off when the new secretary of defense looks 
to further base closings as a means of trimming the pentagon budget 
he should most certainly start with the navy the navy refused to 
play this time it should be obliged to next time eagleton said 
as ribicoff and edwards presented the report to deputy defense 
secretary william h taft iv at the pentagon copies were delivered 
simultaneously to the chairmen of the house and senate armed 
services committees rep les aspin dwis and nunn 
before the commission acted today and aide to aspin said his 
office had been besieged with telephone calls from members of 
congress trying to learn whether their districts were affected 
the pentagon has closed no major installations since 1977 mainly 
because of pressure from members of congress with major bases in 
their districts 
members of the commission visited about 40 bases during a 
sevenmonth examination of the nations 3800 military 
installations the review generally centered on the 870 largest 
bases said jim abbee a commission spokesman 
the estimated annual savings of 693 million cited by ribicoff 
and edwards fell far short of earlier pentagon estimates which 
reached as high as 5 billion aspin had said that 2 billion a year 
was a more realistic figure 
edwards said his panel did not start out with specific targets 
either in number of bases to be closed or in dollars saved 
release of the panels report was the biggest step yet in the 
process set up by congress to close unneeded bases and remove 
congressmen from the political heat that follows the lost jobs 
the edwards panel was approved in the waning days of the 100th 
congress as a political compromise by legislators who wanted to 
reduce the federal budget deficit and also avoid constituent 
criticism 
carlucci will have until jan 15 five days before he leaves 
office to accept or reject the panels findings he will not have 
the option of picking or choosing among the bases 
approval of the package by carlucci would send the issue back to 
the house and senate which may block the closings if both pass 
resolutions against them 
george bush after he becomes president would have the right to 
veto that resolution and his veto could be overridden by a 
twothirds majority of both houses

the california supreme court today 
restricted the right of fired workers to sue their employers on the 
grounds that a dismissal broke a promise of continued employment 
in a victory for employers the court ruled 43 that a worker who 
is fired without good cause in violation of a companys express or 
implied promise can sue only for reinstatement and back pay and 
not for emotional distress and punitive damage awards that often are 
much larger 
citing the need for commercial stability chief justice 
malcolm lucas wrote that it was important that employers not be 
unduly deprived of discretion to dismiss an employee by the fear 
that doing so will give rise to potential tort recovery for 
additional damages in every case 
the court allowed employees to seek the additional damages when 
their firings involved violations of public policy such as a 
workers refusal to violate a law but lucas placed new limits on 
such lawsuits saying the policy involved must serve the public and 
not merely the employers interests 
one proemployee aspect of the ruling was the courts willingness 
to allow lawsuits to proceed based on an oral promise of continued 
employment 
justice allen broussard who wrote one of three separate 
dissenting opinions accused the majority of a radical attempt to 
rewrite california law in a manner which will leave the 
wrongfully discharged worker without an adequate remedy 
the ruling reinstates but sharply limits a lawsuit by daniel 
foley who was fired from his 56164ayear job as los angeles 
branch manager of interactive data corp in 1983 after telling the 
company that his boss was being investigated by the fbi for 
embezzlement from a former employer 
the boss later pleaded guilty to embezzlement foley who had a 
spotless record in nearly seven years of employment refused a

q congressman les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee suggested that there was a loophole in this 
whole procedure and that funds had to be appropriated annually to 
close these bases and by use of that loophole bases could be 
prevented from being closed did you address that question and what 
did you do about it 
edwards there is a problem because the proceeds of the sales of 
these facilities will go into the fund to carry out the purposes of 
this law and those proceeds are not going to start coming in on day 
one its going to take a while to come in and so we have 
recommended in this report that congress in fiscal 1990 
appropriate 300 million to put the first money in the fund so we 
can start the process and obviously if congress refuses to 
appropriate enough money to get the process going then its 
going to be very difficult 
q its often said that certain bases have remained open over the 
years for political or pork barrel reasons did you find any 
evidence of that in your study and how far have you gone to 
eliminating it if thats the case 
ribicoff i dont think there was any influence or any attempt to 
protect pork barrel bases i dont think that was taken into account 
at all i dont think anybody on the commission felt any pressure 
we looked at these bases seriously we looked at all the figures we 
spent a lot of time in discussion each and every base was voted on 
unanimously with the action taken 
edwards you should understand first that we simply did not start 
with a list we started with a set of criteria which we applied 
to all 4300 installations in this country and we took those as 
we found them 
q there are four states that are missing west virginia 
mississippi georgia and wisconsin all home states of the chairmen 
of the armed services and appropriations committees were there no 
bases in those states worthy of closing 
edwards thats certainly not by design we did take a little 
something out of fort mcpherson in georgia i recall i dont 
believe we touched wisconsin west virginia im going to bet 
doesnt have a whole lot of military in the first place we had 
to deal with bases where we found them 
q could you please elaborate on some of the personnel changes 
that are going to take place at fort devens and some of the other 
bases that are getting increases of people 
ribicoff we found that certain missions were split between a 
number of bases they didnt make any sense when they should have 
been consolidated and put in one base and what we did in many 
instances we just do that and especially when you talk about fort 
devens you will find a shift from one fort to the other one 
base to the other which will make it more effective more 
efficient and be able to do a much better job with their mission 
q i wonder if you had the opportunity to pass judgment on the 
value of strategic home porting to see whether dispersion of ships 
offers protection in the nuclear age or whether its really just a 
way of building local political support for various naval tasks 
edwards i dont know anything that was discussed more than 
strategic home porting we concluded that our job was not to 
deal with force structure thats the militarys job our job 
was to try to deal with that force structure as we found it and try 
to accommodate it to the facilities that we were working with and 
so we had to live with the fact that theres going to be a 600ship 
navy maybe there never will be but we dont know that 
so we had to look at the home ports with an idea where are you 
going to put that other 150 ships that are building up from the 
450ship navy and we concluded that we could justify some home 
ports most of them 
q if it were not for political constraints could you actually 
expand your list are there a lot of other bases you consider 
still vulnerable or could be effectively closed 
edwards the biggest constraint is the sixyear payback 
constraint we found a lot of facilities that had 10year paybacks 
12year paybacks even 20year paybacks where we could have made 
some major savings over a longer period of time but we were 
constrained by our charter which had a sixyear payback 
ribicoff once you got over the six years we had to stop i 
think wisdom and better planning would have been more meaningful if 
we werent stuck with that sixyear payback 
q in other words some of these places survived because of 
their inefficiency 
edwards no i think it may cost a lot of money to move one 
facility into another base and have to build allnew construction 
and your payback just simply wont make it

the state department said today investigators 
were working on the assumption the bombing of pan am flight 103 was 
an act of terrorism rather than a nonpolitical crime 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley also said officials believe the case 
can be solved we think that the chances are pretty good she 
said we cant be sure 
as the probe of the dec 21 disaster moved into its second week 
us investigators were still unable to pinpoint guilt mrs oakley 
said they had no hard leads no specifically incriminating evidence 
but asked if the boming of the plane was an act of terrorism in 
contrast to a simple criminal act she said clearly most of us 
feel that it is more likely but we are not sure 
the us official added we really have to pursue all the 
avenues of the investigation to say with certainty that it was a 
terrorist activity 
mrs oakley said no new information had been received since 
wednesday when she declined to say whether a terrorist was behind 
the bombing we are all operating in that sense on the basis of 
assumptions of what seems likely she said 
meanwhile the federal aviation administration mystified how the 
bomb got aboard began searching for possible security lapses by 
american airlines abroad and directed tighter screening of 
passengers and their baggage 
government officials acknowledged wednesday that a week after the 
pan american world airways jumbo jet exploded over scotland killing 
at least 270 people there are no hard leads on who put the 
explosive device on the jet or where the deed was done 
shortly after it was confirmed wednesday by british investigators 
that a bomb caused the boeing 747 to crash dec 21 on a flight to 
new york from london the reagan administration promised all 
available assistance in investigating the bombing 
us officials said there was a wide range of terrorist groups 
that may have been responsible but paul bremer the state 
departments chief of counterterrorism told reporters it was too 
early to focus suspicion on a particular group 
we shouldnt narrow our field of inquiry until we get more 
evidence or intelligence that leads us in a certain direction 
there isnt any prime suspect he said 
bremer said today on cbs this morning that we have a very 
good chance of finding out who was responsible for the bombing but 
that were a long way from those conclusions at this point he 
said officials dont yet know if it was a terrorist attack 
the faa meanwhile said it was reviewing current security 
measures being taken by us air carriers abroad because of the 
bombing and said it was preparing more stringent security 
requirements which will afford additional protection to us air 
carriers and the traveling public 
the faa in a statement did not cite specific changes that are 
being directed at the airlines agency spokesman fred farrar said 
faa security experts are still working out details of the new 
requirements some of which are likely not to be made public 
much of the focus is expected to be on tightening passengers 
screening inspection of carryon luggage and taking additional 
precautions to match all baggage with boarding passengers 
in some cases it will be a matter of degree farrar said 
the faa is responsible for establishing security requirements for 
us airlines both in the united states and abroad although many 
security measures are imposed in cooperation with the other 
governments involved 
while little evidence so far has been uncovered to indicate who 
might be responsible for the pan am bombing us officials said 
there are a number of potential suspects they include radical 
palestinians such as the prosyrian popular front for the liberation 
of palestine general command and the prolibyan abu nidal group 
as well as an iranian group the guardians of islamic revolution 
bremer said among the tasks confronting investigators was to find 
out how the bomb got aboard flight 103 where it was placed and what 
it was made of its not known whether the bomb eluded security at 
frankfurt west germany where flight 103 originated as a boeing 
727 or at londons heathrow airport where the flight shifted to a 
boeing 747 for the trip to new york 
senior faa officials have acknowledged that they are perplexed by 
the bombing because both the frankfurt and london airports are 
considered to be particularly security conscious and pan am had 
undertaken special security precautions because of a tip the airline 
might be a target of a terrorist bombing 
according to faa administrator allan mcartor these precautions by 
pan am included having all checked bags go through xray having all 
carryon bags checked by hand matching all checked luggage with 
boarding passengers and imposing special surveillance of caterers 
and others who might have access to the jetliner 
the white house pledged all available resources to help the 
british investigation including assistance from the fbi fbi 
director william b sessions said that includes interviewing 
relatives and associates of passengers aboard the pan am jet to 
determine if a bomb might have been placed aboard the plane to 
target a specific passenger 
last week the us government offered a reward of up to 500000 
for information leading to the prosecution of any terrorist or 
saboteur who caused the crash 
the incident points up the need for the international community 
to adopt even more stringent air security measures state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
she said the united states had agreed with finnish police in 
ruling out any connection between the crash and a dec 5 telephone 
call to the us embassy in helsinki from a person who said a pan am 
jet would be the target of a bombing in december that call had 
prompted an alert from the faa and caused pan am to increase 
security at frankfurt and london officials have said

two israeli helicopter gunships attacked 
with rockets and destroyed a base of the shiite moslem militia amal 
in southern lebanon today police said eight people were wounded 
on wednesday israeli soldiers shot and killed three suspected 
infiltrators who crossed the border from egypt and mounted searches 
in the negev desert for a fourth man who escaped a military 
spokesman in israel said today 
the israeli army said todays raid was conducted to eliminate an 
amal base used by palestinian guerrillas who raided northern isreal 
on wednesday 
lebanese police said the israeli cobra gunships struck at 8 am 
today hitting a fourstory hilltop building used as an amal command 
post in bir elsalassel near the village of tibnin 9 miles north 
of the israeli border 
the building took several direct rocket hits and was leveled 
said a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations the israelis said the helicopters had returned safely 
tibnin is north of israels selfproclaimed security zone and is 
the headquarters of the irish battalion serving with the united 
nations interim forces in lebanon 
the air raid was israels first on an amal base since 1985 when 
the israeli army pulled back and established the 8to10milewide 
security zone three years after invading lebanon 
an israeli military spokesman in jerusalem said three palestinian 
guerrillas had used the amal base for an attempt to infiltrate 
israel wednesday they were killed by israeli troops at the border 
the guerrillas belonged to the palestine liberation front a 
small leftist faction supported by syria which also backs amal 
amal members from the base assisted the palestinian guerrillas in 
their attempt to sneak into israel and attack an israeli settlement 
on wednesday the israeli army said 
in the clash near the egyptian border on wednesday it was not 
immediately clear if the infiltration involved guerrillas or 
possibly smugglers 
the israeli army said no identification papers or weapons were 
found on the three bodies one military official said however that 
the possibility they were terrorists has not been ruled out 
the last major infiltration from egypt was in march when three 
palestinian guerrillas hijacked a bus and killed three israeli 
civilians before they were shot to death the plos force 17 claimed 
responsibility 
soldiers first detected the infiltration wednesday when they 
found footprints leading across israels southern border with egypt 
said a military spokesman who cannot be identified by name under 
army rules 
in another development the washington post quoting israeli 
sources said a group of armed palestinians was trapped wednesday 
night near the jordanian border settlement of ein yahav unconfirmed 
reports said three members of the group were killed however an 
israeli army spokesman asked if there were two infiltrations said 
we have only the one we announced from egypt 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said on wednesday that palestinian 
guerrillas are stepping up attacks against israel partly because of 
the us decision to talk to the plo 
shamir and other israeli leaders in their recent statements have 
not mentioned the deep divisions within the plo apparently in part 
because terror attacks pinned on the group help discredit the 
diplomatic initiative of plo chairman yasser arafat 
arafat who heads the plos mainstream fatah faction said 
earlier this month that he recognized israel and renounced terror 
and in return the united states dropped its refusal to talk to the 
plo

the state department criticized the supreme 
court of el salvador on thursday for deciding against the 
extradition of a former air force captain who was arrested last year 
in miami in the investigation of the 1980 assassination of 
archbishop oscar romero 
the salvadoran government withdrew its request for the 
extradition of alvaro saravia after the central american countrys 
court ruled last week there were no grounds for arresting him on 
charges he had violated his visa and that the extradition request 
itself was illegal 
romero an outspoken critic of rightist death squads was killed 
march 24 1980 while saying mass in november 1987 president jose 
napoleon duarte who is opposed by rightist political forces in el 
salvador released testimony by the driver of the getaway car that 
he worked for saravia 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the united 
states was concerned whether salvadoran judicial authorities were 
vigorously pursuing human rights cases regardless of the political 
persuasion of violators 
we are still seeking a full explanation of the implications of 
this decision by the salvadoran court she said our embassy 
will indicate our strong disatisfaction with the decision to the 
salvadoran government

chinese officials said thursday they 
probably would punish at least seven african students for a brawl 
with chinese workers students and teachers that set off days of 
antiblack demonstrations 
they said no chinese students would be punished for participating 
in the clash and subsequent demonstrations or for sacking the rooms 
of some african students 
we know who the africans are that carried out the beating 
said yang ruiju president of hehai university where the clash took 
place the african students did this in a planned way 
but the chinese students demonstrated out of anger they didnt 
hurt anybody so none of them will be punished yang said in an 
interview 
about 140 african students joined by about a dozen other foreign 
students remained in isolation at a guest house about a 90minute 
drive outside of this eastern china city yang said the seven 
suspects were at the guest house 
the students have been at the house since monday night when 
chinese police forced them there from the nanking train station the 
students wanted to travel to beijing because they fear for their 
safety 
officials said thursday that all the students except the seven or 
eight africans involved in the fracas could leave the guest house as 
long as they returned to their schools in nanking 
two western reporters who went to the guest house thursday were 
refused permission to speak with the students chinese officials at 
the jiangsu provincial foreign affairs office also refused to let 
reporters talk with the students 
young chinese took to the streets for the fifth straight day 
since saturday when 11 chinese and two africans were injured in the 
hehai clash 
a crowd of about 800 well below the figure on previous nights 
gathered at gulou an old drum tower on a main nanking intersection 
some 600 later marched peacefully from there to the city center 
escorted by hundreds of police 
the students again called on the government to deal with the 
hehai clash according to law 
earlier demonstrations on sunday and monday were markedly racist 
in tone with youths chanting down with black devils and 
black devils go home 
some chinese students also protested preferential conditions 
given to foreign students 
on wednesday night riot police wielding clubs charged a crowd of 
thousands officers hit youths and drove some off in unmarked vans 
thursdays xinhua daily the citys main paper called for peace 
in the streets the frontpage editorial also called for chinese to 
be friendly to foreigners 
in the interview yang claimed the african students at hehai 
planned the bloodshed 
he said the africans started the fight because they were unhappy 
about a wall that was being built around their two dormitories at 
the university if the wall was erected he said the africans 
couldnt play with girls freely 
he also accused the african students of consorting with 
prostitutes 
african students mostly men who spend up to six years in china 
say their social contacts with chinese women frequently are the 
catalyst for racial confrontations although china has close 
relations with most black african states deepseated prejudices 
against blacks are common among chinese they say 
huang jie division chief of the jiangsu provincial foreign 
affairs office in nanking said no arrests have been made so far 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing stressed at a weekly news 
briefing that the incident that has occurred in nanking is an 
isolated one having nothing to do with racial discrimination 
he said charges the africans are being illegally held were 
groundless 
on thursday the only african student to leave the guest house 
and return to nanking said he was afraid for his life and wanted to 
leave china as soon as possible 
i am very fearful said a 23yearold from the comoro islands 
in the indian ocean 
i wont leave this building even seeing a chinese outside the 
window makes me cold with fright said the student who identified 
himself only as bourhane and spoke in an interview at nanking 
polytechnical institute 
at the guest house located at a chemical fiber factory northwest 
of the city chinese officials refused to let two western reporters 
talk with the students

the government rolled back huge price 
increases thursday after a general strike cut off communications 
shut down a main airport and seaport and virtually paralyzed major 
cities reports said 
police fired on antigovernment demonstrators in khartoum who 
continued to press for greater reforms after hearing that the 
government had agreed to cut prices egypts middle east news agency 
reported 
in baghdad the official iraq news agency transmitted a report 
from khartoum that said intensified shooting flared up shortly 
after dark especially near the headquarters of the council of 
ministers 
there was no word on casualties in either incident the first 
reported violence in three days of protests in this financially 
strapped northeast african country 
the demonstrators who were fired on reportedly were demanding 
that in addition to the economic concessions the government work 
toward cementing a tentative plan to end a 5year civil war in 
southern sudan 
the peace pact was negotiated by john garang leader of the rebel 
forces and the leader of the democratic unionist party 
the party junior partner in the ruling coalition dominates the 
2 millionmember sudan workers trade union federation which 
organized thursdays general strike the party announced on 
wednesday it was resigning from the government in sympathy with the 
strikers 
the reported price rollback was decided in an emergency cabinet 
session chaired by prime minister sadek mahdi it canceled increases 
imposed monday of 600 percent for sugar and 50 percent for 
cigarettes and a 15 percent sales tax for all commodities 
a statement reported by the middle east news agency reaffirmed 
salary increases of up to 500 percent that the government had 
decreed on saturday it also said people immediately could buy sugar 
at old prices and that subsidies would be applied to sorghum 
sudans staple food 
the governments had said he it needed the price increases to 
finance the salary increases and subsidy program 
the egyptian agency also quoted abdullah mohammed ahmed the 
information minister as saying work would begin in the coming 
hours on forming a new government in light of the democratic 
unionists pullout 
the sudan news agency quoted information minister abdullah 
mohammed ahmed the governments chief spokesman as promising 
immediate steps to form a new cabinet 
ahmed presumably meant prime minister sadek mahdi would keep his 
post since his umma party has the largest number of parliamentary 
seats 
meanwhile sudanese newspapers and the sudan news agency reported 
many of the countrys major cities were at a standstill thursday 
communications were cut at midmorning the time designated for 
the strike apparently the result of telecommunications workers 
walking off their jobs 
coupled with the shutdown of khartoum international airport and 
port sudan the countrys main red sea port sudan was virtually 
isolated aircraft that normally fly over sudan were being rerouted 
because of the lack of radio contact with khartoum air traffic 
controllers 
the trouble is similar to widespread unrest over high prices that 
brought down former dictator gaafar nimeiri in 1985 after 16 years 
in power then however powerful professional associations of 
doctors and lawyers were in the forefront rather than workers and 
students leading the current protests

a man who refused to force his son to cut his hair 
to bring the teenager into compliance with a high schools grooming 
code has been convicted of violating the states compulsory school 
attendance law 
jurors deliberated about 45 minutes wednesday before convicting 
dub wilkinson of the misdemeanor and fining him 25 the maximum 
with court costs wilkinson 48 will have to pay 100 
wilkinson who said he will appeal was found guilty of not 
requiring his 14yearold son travis to attend northbrook senior 
high school 
travis and his brother brian 16 have not attended class since 
oct 28 when they were barred for failing to adhere to the school 
districts dress code which prohibits boys from having hair that 
falls below their shoulders 
wilkinson had said it was his sons right to wear their hair the 
way they wanted his position remained unchanged after the verdict 
i will not ask my sons to cut their hair that is their 
decision he said 
my dad wouldnt keep me from school travis said wednesday 
i love him 
texas compulsory attendance law only applies through the 
academic year a student turns 16 so brians nonattendance was not 
part of the charges against his father 
during the twoday trial wilkinsons attorney darrell 
mcalexander argued that the hairlength rule is enforced 
selectively he also questioned its purpose and said it held the 
potential for sexual discrimination 
assistant district attorney david furlow said the verdict is a 
reminder to students that the school is not a burger king travis 
cant go there and demand he have it his own way 
district superintendent hal guthrie and principal james king said 
the boys still must cut their hair before they are admitted to class

when it comes to pronouncing the name of 
this tiny community the official ruling is hold the mayo 
the town board of carmel which includes the hamlet of mahopac 
has ruled that the proper pronunciation is mahhopak rather than 
mayopak 
the vote tuesday night was 32 reflecting the division on the 
longdebated issue in this community about 35 miles north of new 
york city 
carmel supervisor richard othmer said that in his experience 
which includes going doortodoor in the past 10 elections half 
the residents call the community mahhopak and half said mayopak 
surveys conducted in 1986 came to opposite conclusions one 
found 74 percent saying mayopac and another found mahhopac 
preferred 113 to 23 
the name is believed to stem from an american indian word but 
its original pronunciation is lost in history 
dorothy jewell of the carmel historical society presented each 
board member at the meeting with a copy of the march 13 1929 issue 
of the old lake mahopac weekly which bears the headline 
mahhopak is the right pronunciation 
thomas carey a lifelong mahopac resident who is the town 
comptroller seconded that pronunciation he pointed out that the 
mahopac high school song includes the phrase high above the 
mahhopaks waters 
its the outoftowners those city folk who moved in over 
the years and changed the name of the community he said

the decision to close fort douglas a 
119acre army installation built in 1862 to protect stagecoach 
routes from indians and keep an eye on mormon settlers came as 
little surprise thursday 
the oncestrategic post in the wasatch mountain foothills east of 
downtown salt lake city had long been criticized in congress as 
contributing little to national defense 
the government commission that put the fort on a list of 
installations to be shut down or scaled back estimated that closing 
fort douglas a collection of parade grounds barracks and other 
brick and whitewashed buildings some dating from the 1920s and 
1930s would save 14 million over 20 years 
members of the utah congressional delegation expressed 
conditional support for the decision the commission called for the 
reassignment of most of the forts 640 fulltime employees to other 
utah military installations 
rep wayne owens a democrat whose district the fort is in 
wont stand in the way if the decision was arrived at fairly and 
if indeed it will save more money than it costs to implement said 
owens spokesman art kingdom 
kingdom said owens would introduce legislation to turn over the 
property to the university of utah rep jim hansen rutah also 
said he would propose such a bill 
im sure theres going to be people disappointed who work 
here said maj bill auer fort spokesman one of the things we 
have to contend with is 44 of our buildings here are also registered 
national historic landmarks 
some of these buildings are quarters that military personnel 
live in he added personally at this point were kind of 
curious as to what and how theyre going to do this 
sen jake garn rutah said he would support the forts closing 
if convinced it is a costeffective move for the army he said he 
understood the installations historic sites and buildings will be 
preserved 
i am pleased that the proposed impact on utah is minimal 
because it is a clear affirmation of the efficiency and value of 
utahs military installations and personnel and the contribution 
they make to our national security garn said 
sen orrin hatch rutah said he understood only 77 civilian 
jobs will be lost as a result 
while salt lake city has no plans for the land and buildings 
mayor palmer depauli believes it would be perfect for an olympic 
village if the city succeeds in its bid for the 1998 winter 
olympics said chief of staff mike zuhl 
while officially built as an indian post the forts first 
commander col patrick conner acknowledged that he chose the 
foothills overlooking salt lake city so he could keep an eye on 
brigham youngs polygamypracticing mormon pioneers 
connor referred to the settlers who had arrived in the salt lake 
valley in 1847 as a community of traitors murderers fanatics 
and whores who also were too friendly with the indians 
tensions ran so high that when troops fired the forts cannon to 
salute connors promotion to general in 1863 the mormons assumed it 
was an attack a thousand or more mormon minutemen quickly 
assembled to protect the city but hostilities were avoided 
relations between the government and mormons were strained when 
conner tried to force merchants to take an oath of loyalty to the 
united states as a condition of selling goods at the fort the 
crisis abated after conners departure 
the church dropped polygamy in 1890 and utah became a state in 
1896 from that point the army and city got along well 
in modern times the forts personnel have been assigned a variety 
of missions the base gives logistic and administrative support 
primarily to reserve units but also active units in utah idaho 
and wyoming 
it also is headquarters for pentagon recruiting efforts in the 
region and is the reserve pay office for 14 states more than 2300 
reservists with the army navy marines and coast guard train at the 
fort each year

the government has refused to grant automatic 
resident status to 85000 people living in canada who claim to be 
refugees immigration officials said 
the government instead will begin screening each case after jan 
1 with some deportations virtually assured said immigration 
minister barbara mcdougall 
i want to state categorically that removals will take place 
she said many people came here making refugee claims to 
circumvent our immigration laws we must restore integrity to 
our refugee and immigration system 
she declined at a news conference on wednesday to estimate how 
many of the 85000 claims pending will be accepted under a twoyear 
screening program expected to cost 83 million 
the announcement of the screening program drew criticism from 
some quarters 
no one wants to reward refugee scam artists or the blatant 
queuejumpers who take the place of legitimate applicants the 
toronto star said in an editorial but to show little compassion 
for those thousands who have been here for months seems hardhearted 
at the very least 
the star which frequently criticizes prime minister brian 
mulroneys progressive conservative government asked if this could 
be the same canada that demonstrated its compassion to the world 
in 1979 by accepting more than 75000 vietnamese boat people 
but the tabloid toronto sun praised the decision deporting the 
phony refugees is the only fair way to handle those who try to jump 
the queue ahead of those who have been waiting for years some of 
them to be reunited with their families 
officials said humanitarian or compassionate grounds will be 
considered before any deportation 
although activists believe the program could threaten people 
genuinely seeking refuge in canada others say many of the 
immigrants are seeking economic improvements and not political 
safety 
the program will send each of the 85000 people claiming refugee 
status before government panels each with two members a decision 
by any one member of the panel that political religious or other 
reasons threaten the claimants safety is enough to clear the way to 
immigrant status 
the special program was needed only for the backlog because a new 
system is intended to reject false refugee claims upon arrival in 
canada a limited amnesty was declared in may 1986 for about 22000 
people who were then claiming refugee status granting residency to 
all who already had jobs or family in canada and no criminal record 
the backlog of refugee claims has increased steadily from 6500 
in 1984 to the current level which would take five to seven years 
to clear under the present system 
alan shefman of the ontario human rights commission said in a 
phone interview there was cautious optimism that the refugee 
claimants will get fair and quick hearings he said the 
organization was relieved that the claimants will be able to work 
while awaiting a decision 
canada the worlds secondlargest country in territory has a 
population of 26 million it traditionally has encouraged 
immigration and the government has raised its target from 125000 
to 135000 in 1988 to 150000 to 160000 next year

israeli soldiers shot and killed three 
infiltrators who crossed the border from egypt and mounted searches 
thursday in the negev desert for a fourth man who escaped a 
military spokesman said 
it was not immediately clear if the infiltration wednesday 
involved guerrillas or possibly smugglers the army withheld reports 
of the incident until thursday apparently to prevent panic among 
the public 
an army spokesman said no identification papers or weapons were 
found on the bodies one military official said however that the 
possibility they were terrorists has not been ruled out 
the infiltration came on the heels of three attempts earlier this 
week by palestinian guerrillas to enter israel from lebanon 
nine guerrillas were killed in those attacks which were seen as 
attempts by dissident syrianbacked groups to disrupt the plos 
dialogue with the united states 
speaking to reporters prime minister yitzhak shamir said the 
us decision earlier this month to open a dialogue with the 
palestine liberation organization had created a climate for 
increased attacks 
it is a fact that the latest american decision to have talks 
with the plo has encouraged the tendency of violent acts against 
israel he said 
the last major infiltration from egypt was in march when three 
palestinian guerrillas hijacked a bus and killed three israeli 
civilians before they were shot to death the plos force 17 claimed 
responsibility 
soldiers first detected the infiltration wednesday when they 
found footprints leading across israels southern border with egypt 
said a military spokesman who cannot be identified by name under 
army rules 
he said troops followed the tracks to a small truck south of the 
town of mitzpe ramon 10 miles from the border with egypt 
the soldiers opened fire when the driver ignored an order to stop 
and killed three men a fourth escaped he said 
military helicopters circled above the negev desert thursday as 
searches for the missing man continued israel army radio said 
state radio said the resort town of eilat 90 miles south of 
mitzpe ramon was cut off from the rest of the country for most of 
the day after the army closed the road for its searches 
on monday israeli troops killed three suspected palestinian 
guerrillas not far from israels northern border with lebanon three 
more guerrillas were killed in the same area on wednesday 
also monday three guerrillas drowned when their boat capsized 
off the coast of southern lebanon as they made their way to the 
northern israeli coast 
the army spokesman denied rumors that two israeli soldiers were 
injured in the gunfight

soviet scientists have recommended a siberian radar 
station that the united states says violates the antiballistic 
missile treaty be turned into an ecological center radio moscow 
reported thursday 
president mikhail s gorbachev previously offered to turn over 
the giant phasedarray radar in krasnoyarsk to a civilian agency 
but the united states had rejected anything short of dismantling the 
station 
disputes over the observance of the 1972 abm treaty are among the 
differences that have stymied superpower negotiations on a treaty to 
halve us and soviet arsenals of longrange offensive nuclear 
weapons 
the soviet academy of science suggested that the krasnoyarsk 
radar center would make a good international ecological center 
because its equipment is capable of closely measuring atmospheric 
processes caused by air pollution the official radio said 
on sept 27 foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said at the 
united nations the radar should become part of an international 
space organization he did not specifically say it would be 
dismantled he also said us radars in greenland and britain should 
be converted 
the kremlin announced in october that it was giving the station 
which is in central siberia to the academy of sciences and foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said it would be turned over 
to international space study 
but the us government said the move was unsatisfactory because 
it did not include the complete dismantling of the radar 
the united states says the plant violates provisions of the abm 
treaty that specify that radar stations capable of giving advanced 
warnings of missile attacks may only be located on the periphery of 
us or soviet territory

a government commission called thursday for 
closing 34 military installations including five major air force 
bases and the armys secondlargest basic training site in a 
recommendation that could send economic shock waves to communities 
across america 
in addition the commission on base realignment and closure 
recommended closing 52 military housing units in 13 states that date 
back to the construction of nike missile bases in the 1950s and 
partially closing five military facilities and changing the mission 
and the manpower levels at 54 other facilities 
the panels recommendations appeared to have a good chance of 
taking effect if defense secretary frank c carlucci approves them 
as expected congress would have to reject the whole list in order 
to save any of the facilities and even such a resolution of 
disapproval could be vetoed by presidentelect george bush after he 
moves into the white house on jan 20 
carlucci who has strongly supported the work of the bipartisan 
commission has until jan 15 five days before leaving office to 
either accept or reject the entire list 
the first overhaul in 11 years of the nations web of 3800 
military installations could save an estimated 693 million a year 
without hindering the national security said abraham ribicoff a 
former democratic senator from connecticut and cochairman of the 
panel 
the 693 million savings is minuscule when compared with the 
pentagons annual budget of 300 billion 
the states hit hardest by the panels recommendations were 
california which would lose five major installations and illinois 
which would lose two the area of the nation faring best was the 
south which wouldnt lose any major facilities 
the five air force bases recommended for closure include chanute 
in illinois george mather and norton in california and pease in 
new hampshire their missions would be shifted to other bases 
also closed would be the presidio a major army administrative 
base in san francisco and fort douglas in utah a facility built in 
1862 to protect pony express riders from indians it has often been 
cited as a prime example of unneeded bases 
the five bases that would be partially shut down include fort 
dix nj where 33490 recruits underwent basic training in the 
year that ended sept 30 only fort jackson sc trains more 
recruits fort dix would go on semiactive status at a loss of 4686 
military and civilian jobs 
fiftyfour other bases should be realigned meaning they would 
either gain or lose personnel the commission said 
also closed would be part of fort meade md and the 
philadelphia naval hospital which the navy has long wanted to shut 
down 
the panel called for halting construction at three sites where 
the navy wanted to built new ports for its growing fleet of ships 
and closing the sites they are the hunters point naval station in 
san francisco the galveston texas naval station and the lake 
charles la naval station 
the early reaction from congress was generally positive sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services committee said 
the odds are heavily in favor of the list becoming law 
my general feeling is this will be well received by the 
congress he said nunns state would not lose any major bases 
sen john warner rva ranking republican on the armed services 
committee agreed i think the recommendation will make it all the 
way through he said 
but sens alan dixon and paul simon both illinois democrats 
noted their state is losing chanute air force base and the armys 
fort sheridan they complained that overseas bases should be closed 
before any us facilities are mothballed 
ribicoff and panel cochairman jack edwards a former republican 
congressman from alabama predicted some legislators would be 
unhappy but said congress isnt likely to overturn the decision 
legislators with bases on the reduction list are going to be 
unhappy and we understand that said edwards but we feel like 
the majority of the house and senate will support what we have 
done 
local communities will be unhappy edwards said of course 
they will have a hard time swallowing the decision in some 
communities a military base provides a source of employment and a 
sure source of income in good times and bad 
edwards said he was sympathetic with communities that would lose 
facilities because an air force base closed in his district 25 years 
ago costing 14000 jobs i certainly understand the impact he 
said 
closed bases mean lost jobs and congress has refused to permit 
any major closures since 1977 when the first of a thicket of rules 
and regulations was enacted to make it hard for the pentagon to pare 
down the installation list 
the 12member panel was created this year as a way to circumvent 
such congressional roadblocks and there were predictions the annual 
savings might be as high as 2 billion to 5 billion 
the savings estimate provided by the commission does fall short 
of the savings estimates which many had predicted nunn said 
but hayden b bryan executive director of the panel said those 
early estimates were just pulled out of the air 
the panel working in strict secrecy considered a number of 
factors including military utility and whether a bases functions 
could be better carried out at another location 
another requirement was that the onetime costs of closing a 
base such as severance pay and waste cleanup would be offset 
within six years by the money that would be saved 
our report represents an opportunity to reduce training costs 
in terms of manpower overhead costs and fuel to improve command 
and control consolidate training and improve economies of scale and 
to remove unnecessary administrative burdens to our defense 
managers edwards said 
two installations loring air force base in maine and virginias 
fort monroe escaped even though they have long been included on 
critics lists of unneeded bases it was the air forces attempt to 
close loring in 1977 which prompted the congressional roadblocks to 
the pentagons base realignment efforts 
fort monroe was originally built with a moat to protect us 
forces from british attack in the war of 1812 
edwards said loring and fort monroe escaped the ax because they 
have developed new uses in recent years meaning they didnt met the 
commissions complicated set of criteria for closing a base 
while some of the 34 bases that would be closed are major 
installations with big payrolls others are far smaller 
installations 
the latter include such places as fort wingate a new mexico site 
where the army stores ammunition and which employs only 92 people 
the armys tacony warehouse in philadelphia and hamilton army 
airfield near san francisco which employs only 29 people and is 
used only as a training center for reservists

the law and order minister 
thursday banned four antiapartheid groups using stateofemergency 
regulations that have shut down 28 other organizations this year 
two of the latest targets were teachers unions and a third was a 
student group that coordinated antigovernment protests this year in 
mixedrace townships near cape town 
the fourth banned group was the national detainees forum 
established in july to carry on monitoring work that had been 
conducted by the detainees parents support committee before its 
banning in february 
both watchdog groups have played a major role in providing 
information on the thousands of activists most of them black 
detained without charge for varying periods during the 30monthold 
state of emergency 
a statement issued on behalf of law and order minister adriaan 
vlok said the predominantly black democratic teachers union and the 
predominantly mixedrace western cape teachers union had promoted 
peoples education an effort by nonwhite communities to exert 
greater control over curriculum in their schools 
a year ago the cabinet minister for black education gerrit 
viljoen said the government saw important positive elements in 
peoples education but lt peet bothma a spokesman for vlok said 
thursday that the concept was inspired by the outlawed african 
national congress guerrilla movement 
the two teachers unions both founded in 1985 were 
politicizing education and discrediting the education system 
said bothma both are involved in the broad revolutionary 
onslaught against south africa which could escalate into strikes 
boycotts terror and unrest incidents 
bothma said the government had similar concerns about the 
predominantly mixedrace western cape students congress one of a 
dozen youth and student groups banned this year 
thousands of mixedrace students around cape town in some cases 
supported by faculty staged a widespread classroom boycott in april 
to protest detentions and harassment of students and teachers 
the latest bannings were denounced by south africas human rights 
commission it described the government as powerdrunk and said 
that only 24 organizations had been banned in a 37year period 
before 1988 
the newly banned organizations have never been accused in court 
of any illegal actions the commission said in a statement 
their bannings are a result of their steadfast opposition to 
apartheid policies 
the 17 groups affected by the initial banning orders in february 
included the largest antiapartheid coalition the united democratic 
front and a nationwide blackconsciousness group the azanian 
peoples organization 
the main antiapartheid labor federation the congress of south 
african trade unions was prohibited from political activity as part 
of the crackdown although it has not muted its criticism of the 
government 
but much of the aboveground leadership of the antiapartheid 
movement has shifted to an alliance of clergymen including anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu and the rev allan boesak president of the 
world alliance of reformed churches 
the countrys main mixedrace political party thursday ended its 
annual conference with a pledge to seek contacts with the african 
national congress 
labor party delegates rejected a proposal to quit parliament as a 
protest against apartheid but resolved to take more initiative in 
working with nonparliamentary groups to undermine the white 
governments racial policies 
parliament has chambers for whites asians and people of mixed 
race but the black majority is excluded

police said thursday they have 
located five more cattle ranchers who may be linked to the slaying 
of a prominent ecologist who fought to protect the amazon forest 
three other cattlemen already have been arrested in the death of 
francisco mendes 44 who was gunned down dec 22 outside his home 
about 50 miles outside of brasilia 
about 80 officers from brasilia and sao paulo were transferred 
wednesday to the western amazon state of acre to search the jungles 
for suspects in the death said deputy justice minister luis 
fernando eichenberg 
overnight the police located five ranchers who may be suspects 
in the mendes case but nothing has been confirmed eichenberg 
said he gave no further details 
eichenberg contacted by telephone in brasilia refused to 
confirm press reports that said five suspects all cattle ranchers 
had been arrested by police on a ranch near the jungle village of 
xapuri where mendes was slain xapuri is about 2600 miles 
northwest of rio de janeiro 
police already were holding in custody three sons of darly alves 
da silva a cattle rancher who mendes had said sent him death 
threats mendes led a local rubber tappers union that fought against 
clearing the amazon for cattle grazing 
mendes last year received a united nations global 500 prize given 
to top ecologists worldwide 
eichenberg said police had found several clues indicating that 
oloci alves da silva captured tuesday after a gun battle on the 
family ranch in xapuri was at the scene of the mendes shooting 
the police have analyzed several cigarette butts found in front 
of mendes house and oloci is known to have smoked the same 
brand said the justice minisitry official this and other clues 
lead us to believe he was present when mendes was killed 
also being held were 21yearold darcy pereira da silva who 
claims to have killed mendes and his brother aleci alves da silva 
police have said they doubt darcy da silva participated in mendes 
slaying and that he is being used as a decoy by his father whose 
whereabouts is unknown 
eichenburg said the police would extend possibly throughout the 
month of january a sweep operation begun wednesday to find 
and confiscate illegal weapons in the region in a push to halt 
landdispute violence in the western amazon 
for the second day police flew over the jungle in helicopters 
and search planes they set up road blocks along highways and the 
states border with bolivia in the search for da silva and any 
unregistered weapons 
the atmosphere in acre is extremely tense and it is up to the 
police to control any further outbreaks of violence said 
eichenburg 
the battles over the amazon jungle an expanse of rainforest 
about twothirds the size of continental united states has often 
erupted in bloody clashes 
cattle ranchers eager to clear forest lands for grazing often 
order the killings of squatters and ecologists who oppose them

oncampus link between usda and each of the universities 
myers said the offices will help with curriculum development 
recruit and counsel students on employment opportunities in usda 
and develop new ideas and approaches to help smallscale 
limitedresource and minority farmers 
from international trade to the revitalization of rural 
america there are numerous career opportunities in agriculture and 
forestry he said usda is strengthening its ties to the 1890 
institution to ensure that minority youth know of those 
opportunities and are encouraged to seek out careers in 
agriculture

talks between south korea and north korea 
on easing tension suffered a sharp setback thursday when north korea 
demanded an end to ussouth korean military exercises 
the fivemember delegations of both sides agreed to meet again 
feb 10 at this truce village inside the demilitarized zone 
seprating the two nations 
the threehour meeting plunged into stalemate a few minutes after 
it opened when north korea issued a new demand for an end to annual 
ussouth korea team spirit exercises it says threaten its 
security 
the chief north korean delegate chon kum chul said this was a 
precondition for the parliamentary talks and other proposals for 
interkorea contacts 
team sprit war exercises have created a state of quasiwar and 
affected southnorth talks in progress the exercises have been the 
biggest obstacle blocking the progress of dialogue chon said 
his south korean counterpart chai munshick accused north korea 
of laying a new obstacle before the talks and insisted the issue be 
addressed at other governmentlevel talks expected early next year 
north korea rejected the idea 
south korea and the united states hold annual spring military 
exercises to practice their joint command system in the event of a 
north korean invasion about 200000 troops of both sides took part 
in last years exercises from february to april 
south korea had hoped before thursdays meeting the seventh 
since august that agreement was near on setting terms for 
fullscale talks between each sides legislatures after making 
progress at a nov 17 meeting 
chai expressed surprise and suspicion at north koreas new 
demand and asked that it be dropped saying the exercises are annual 
and defensive 
north koreas demand is very disappointing i suspect that 
their resolve to make the talks a success has weakened chai said 
after the meeting 
chon declined to withdraw the demand and suggested the military 
exercises could be an obstacle to the parliamentary talks and 
proposals for separate government and sports talks 
rep park kwanyong an opposition member on the south korean 
delegation said north korea used the same tactics three years ago 
park a member of south korean negotiating team in talks with 
north korea in 1985 said lawmakers of both sides were close to 
agreement and scheduled to meet in midfebruary in 1986 north korea 
unilaterally suspended all dialogue to protest the team spirit 
exercises 
the meeting was held the day after seoul sent a message to north 
korea agreeing to separate political and military talks on arms 
reductions and other tensioneasing measures 
prime minister kang younghoon wrote his north korean 
counterpart yon hyung muk that they head delegations to 
alternating talks in seoul and pyongyang to discuss 
noninterference cooperation in select areas and building mutual 
trust in military matters 
south korea has yet to respond to three more north korean 
proposals for political military and sports talks one proposal 
seeks the withdrawal of the 42000 us troops stationed here under 
a mutual defense treaty 
talks have been held on and off since the early 1970s with little

the federal communications commission issued a 
warning thursday about the unauthorized use of emergency locator 
transmitters used to aid in the search and rescue of downed or 
disabled aircraft 
the warning was directed at users of emergency personal locators 
for which misleading advertisements imply that these devices are 
authorized for use by backpackers and hikers to alert search and 
rescue personnel the fcc said 
emergency locator transmitters are authorized for use only by 
aircraft in distress or in an aeronautical emergency their use for 
any other purpose is prohibited because it would jeopardize the 
effectiveness of the transmitters in aeronautical search and rescue 
operations the fcc said 
the frequencies allocated to emergency locator transmitters 
cannot accommodate an additional large number of personal users 
such as backpackers and hikers the commission said in its warning 
the penalty for unauthorized use of these transmitters includes 
fines up to 10000 and possible imprisonment it said 
the fcc said ads for emergency personal locators have appeared in 
sales catalogs but it did not identify the publications officials 
at the agency said they did not know whether unauthorized use of 
these transmitters has hampered any aeronautical search and rescue 
operations

romanian leader nicolae ceausescu said 
in a rare interview with a western newspaper that his controversial 
plan to raze 7000 villages is needed to modernize the countryside 
in a related development a frankfurtbased human rights 
organization said romanian border police this year have killed at 
least 400 romanians many of hungarian or german descent trying to 
flee to yugoslavia 
among the villages to be razed under ceausescus plan are most of 
those where ethnic hungarians or germans form a majority of the 
local population 
the bonn daily newspaper die welt said the autocratic communist 
party ruler spoke in a recent interview in bucharest romanias 
capital die welt released excerpts of the interview to news 
agencies before its publication friday 
our villages should systematically take on a new appearance 
ceausescu was quoted as saying romanians in the third millenium 
must belong to a nation with a higher living standard enjoyed by 
each citizen in equal measure 
ceausescu last spring revealed plans for destroying about 7000 
of romanias 13000 villages and resettling residents in housing 
complexes attached to agroindustrial centers 
the plan is aimed at providing more farmland and at modernizing 
the agricultural industry but it has drawn criticism from east and 
west 
foreign critics including former us ambassador david 
funderburk contend ceausescu is trying to wipe out the vestiges of 
romanias capitalist and religious past 
last month the romanian leader appeared to back down somewhat 
from his announcement the villages would disappear under his 
resettlement plan he said at the time that some communes in rural 
romania would be preserved to avoid depopulating the countryside 
in the die welt interview ceausescu reiterated that those who 
want to stay in their village homes will be allowed to 
but he contended that a systematic consolidation of rural 
residents into agricultural centers is necessary to improve living 
conditions transport and labor productivity 
ceausescu has said the relocation project should be completed by 
2000 
so far only scattered villages near the capital bucharest have 
been razed but the policy has caused widespread disruption in the 
countryside and disturbed relations with foreign countries 
particularly allied hungary 
the international society for human rights in frankfurt said 
thursday that the romanianyugoslavian border is the bloodiest in 
europe 
romanians have attempted to flee the country in droves and at 
least 400 have been shot and killed by romanian border police in the 
past year the private human rights group said in a dispatch to news 
media 
it said an even larger number of romanians drowned while trying 
to escape by swimming the danube which borders the two countries 
but it did not give a figure 
the society said many of those who succeeded in reaching 
yugoslavia were sent back to romania unless the refugees managed to 
contact united nations authorities in belgrade 
in budapest hungary the commander of hungarys border guards 
said 6974 romanians have tried to cross illegally into hungary this 
year a fourfold increase over last year 
but the commander janos szekely disputed reports that hundreds 
of romanians attempting to flee to hungary were shot and killed by 
romanian border guards 
an estimated 30000 romanians most of them ethnic hungarians 
have found refuge in hungary which in january took the 
unprecedented step of accepting refugees from a fellow warsaw pact 
country 
szekely said 1400 romanians who fled illegally into hungary were 
returned to romania but he said they were undesirables such as 
common criminals vagrants and teenage delinquents 
die welt also quoted ceausescu as rejecting the reforms of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev as a model for other socialist 
nations 
there is no model no stencil for development in the socialist 
world ceausescu was quoted as saying each nation must 
differentiate itself in this way 
the newspaper said ceausescu also rejected suggestions that his 
efforts to pay off foreign loans have harshly affected living 
conditions in romania including widespread shortages of power food 
and consumer goods 
he acknowledged a few difficulties but he said the 
government has brought prices under control and expects a stable 
energy situation in two years

passengers traveling on us airlines were 
questioned about their luggage and had their bags xrayed thursday 
in a security clampdown at british airports prompted by the bombing 
of pan am flight 103 
the disclosure that plastic explosives blew up the boeing 747 on 
dec 21 killing all 259 people and 11 on the ground set off a 
worldwide hunt for the perpetrators 
the british foreign secretary called for the cooperation of 
governments in the middle east where palestinian and iranian 
extremists are key suspects 
presidentelect george bush said he would severely punish the 
bombers if they were found 
at britains four airports that handle us carriers passengers 
fed their checked luggage through xray machines and were asked 
about who packed their bags when they were packed whether the bags 
had been out of their sight since and whether strangers gave them 
parcels to carry 
the xrayed suitcases were bound in a tough plastic strip to 
prevent them from being opened between the checkin desks and the 
plane anything arousing suspicion was opened and searched by hand 
at heathrow airports busy terminal 3 used by us carriers pan 
am and twa police patrolled with submachine guns issued to them 
after 1986 terrorist incidents in europe 
sure theres a risk but youve got more chance of getting 
killed on a street in new york said sam fleischacker a 
philadelphia college professor rushing to catch a twa flight to new 
york 
he said he flew to london on vacation the day after the pan am 
crashed into the scottish village of lockerbie and i was worried 
then gesturing to the xray machine he said what worries me a 
lot too is that they didnt have all this then 
as he spoke he drifted a few feet away from his bags and was 
promptly upbraided by ground staff for leaving them unattended 
on wednesday the department of transport ordered the four 
british airports handling us carriers to step up security hank 
auerbach pan ams chief in northern europe said the airline had 
met all the requirements set by the department of transport he 
refused to elaborate 
in france police said security was heightened at paris charles 
de gaulle and orly airports with undisclosed measures for us 
carriers officials at romes leonardo da vinci airport also said 
they had increased security 
the british directive took effect a few hours after wednesdays 
disclosure that a bomb blew flight 103 out of the sky the directive 
was aimed at heathrow neighboring gatwick manchester in northern 
england and prestwick in scotland 
amid a now familiar debate about what else can be done to protect 
airlines from terrorists analysts speculated that the bomb could 
have been smuggled aboard in a suitcase or into the cargo hold by 
ground staff 
many looked to el al israels national carrier which has had 
long experience fighting terrorism and handsearches all baggage 
british lawmaker david wilshire whose constituency includes 
heathrow said el al also puts freight through simulated pressure 
procedures so that any bomb set to be detonated by altitude changes 
would explode on the ground 
brian jenkins a us terrorism consultant said key tasks for 
the investigators were to check the background of every passenger on 
flight 103 and look for false identities to discover whether any 
had connections that could make them witting or unwitting 
accomplices and to trace every item of cargo back to its origins 
the investigation involves scottish police the british 
antiterrorism squad the fbi and west german federal police 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe asked for the cooperation of 
middle east governments 
this may well be a long painstaking structured matter 
warned detective chief superintendent john orr of the glasgow area 
police who is heading the criminal investigation 
police officers flew to west germany thursday as part of the 
investigation orr said in lockerbie he said officers also would be 
sent to other parts of the world he declined to elaborate 
washington has offered a 500000 reward for information leading 
to those responsible for the crash 
bush asked for his reaction to the air tragedy said thursday 
well horror and seek hard and punish firmly decisively those 
who did this if you could ever find them 
but charles price the us ambassador to britain said the us 
government was unlikely to retaliate if the killers were identified 
i dont know of any contingency plans that involve some form of 
retaliation on our part and i cant imagine that it is very 
likely price told reporters at heathrow before boarding a british 
airways concorde jet en route to california for new years he said 
he would return to lockerbie jan 4 to attend a memorial service for 
the victims 
in a field outside a church in the countryside near lockerbie 
engineers sawed up the planes nose section for removal john 
wagner the brother of copilot raymond wagner visited the church 
and asked for and was given two bibles as mementos for the family 
said the minister the rev cameron gibson 
relatives laid wreaths by the cockpit while in lockerbie a 
crane lifted one of the engines out of the 15footdeep crater in 
which it had lain for eight days 
so far 241 bodies have been found but only 16 have been 
identified and released for burial six americans and a briton were 
identified thursday

a judge thursday declined to get 
involved in a dispute over the election of a communist student body 
leader at the university of massachusetts saying the students and 
university should resolve the matter 
the student jason rabinowitz was elected copresident of the 
student government last spring with shari silkoff a selfdescribed 
progressive 
but they had been barred from taking office by a student judicial 
body on the ground that the student constitution prohibited 
copresidents 
rabinowitz and silkoff contended they were barred because of 
their political beliefs and they asked superior court judge 
elizabeth porada to issue an injunction assuring their right to take 
office 
in turning down the request porada wrote that the matter is 
best left to the decision of the students student senate and 
university judiciary without the intervention by the courts or 
trustees of the university 
the judge also said an injunction was unnecessary because the 
schools student supreme court had recently lifted its own ban 
against the two students taking office 
the students election still must be ratified by the student 
government associations senate 
edward etheredge an attorney for rabinowitz and silkoff said 
the students were away for the holidays but that he had expected the 
judges decision 
he added that because of the recent ruling by the student supreme 
court his clients had moved back into their offices 
the issue now is whether the university pays jason and shari 
their back compensation and attorneys fees if they dont well be 
back in court he said 
university attorney terrence omalley was reported to be out of 
his office thursday afternoon and could not be reached for comment 
running as a team rabinowitz a founding member of the young 
communist league and silkoff were elected in march by 1454 votes 
a 361vote margin over a conservative candidate at the 
19000undergraduate school 
a month after the election the student supreme court barred the 
two from the post 
the presidency of the student government association is a paid 
position with the power to hire and appoint other students to the 
government body 
rabinowitz and silkoff argued that bylaws allow for 
copresidents and that the student judicial tribunal consisted of 
conservatives handpicked by a student attorney general who was 
chief among their political foes 
the civil liberties union of massachusetts sued on their behalf 
alleging that their civil rights were violated by campus 
conservatives intent on keeping them from office

leaders of the military committees in congress 
said thursday they like the baseclosing recommendations made by a 
special commission and predicted the proposals will be accepted by 
congress 
i have a positive reaction sen sam nunn dga chairman of 
the senate armed services committee said at a news conference 
this process is a step forward i would have liked to have 
seen more 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee told reporters he supports the plan and will urge 
colleagues to do likewise 
aspin said his only criticism was that the commissions report 
was too modest and that the list of targeted bases could have 
been up to about 30 percent larger he did not specify what other 
bases could have been included 
this is a good start said virginia sen john warner a 
former navy secretary who is the ranking republican on nunns 
committee he said the commissions report confirmed that there 
are inefficient aspects of our defense budget 
the three lawmakers said they believe the panels recommendations 
to close 86 installations and reduce or alter operations at 59 
others will be accepted by congress which would face an 
allornothing decision once the report reaches capitol hill after a 
review by defense secretary frank c carlucci 
my general feeling is this will be well received by the 
congress nunn said the odds are heavily in favor of this 
becoming the law of the land 
warner told reporters he believes the recommendation will make 
it all the way through congress which created the commission this 
year to break the impasse that has prevented lawmakers from agreeing 
on any major closings since 1977 
warner and nunn said budget deficits require the defense 
department and congress to look toward further base closings and 
consolidations to generate more economies than the 693 million a 
year the commission says its plan would save 
i think this ought to be a continuous source of study by the 
new defense secretary said nunn who wants overseas basis 
included in such a review theres still a way to go in terms of a 
complete review based on the new budget circumstances 
rep bill lowery rcalif said his initial reaction to the plan 
was positive lowery is the ranking gop member of the appropriations 
subcommittee on military construction which would have the initial 
house say on financing the closure plan 
lowery represents san diego which would be a winner under the 
plan gaining five navy ships 1473 military personnel and 22 
civilian jobs all of which had been slated for san francisco 
there is no question in these tight budgetary times we are 
going to have to do more with less lowery said in a statement 
sen bill roth rdel one of the principal authors of the law 
that created the commission said the recommendations are a 
crucial step towards achieving real savings for the american 
taxpayer delaware had no bases on ths hit list 
but illinois did fort sheridan and chanute air force base and 
its two democratic senators issued a joint statement saying the 
commission should have looked at overseas bases before targeting 
domestic installations 
how can we justify closing military bases in our own back yard 
when we dont even consider a single one of the 1500 overseas us 
military facilities for the same treatment said sen alan dixon 
chairman of the armed services subcommittee on readiness 
the overseas bases ought to be looked at first to make sure the 
need is still there sen paul simon said 
nunn and warner said they thought the commission had done the 
best job it could under various constraints some imposed by the 
pentagon and others like a relatively short study period imposed 
by congress 
nunn said the panel had to use current pentagon budget figures 
even though the new spending plan going to congress next month is 
expected to be lower changing the parameters for evaluating the 
need for some bases 
he specifically said the commission approached navy installations 
with the assumption the us battle fleet would have 600 ships a 
goal he said is not attainable in the forseeable future 
nunn also questioned wby the pentagon prevented the commission 
from studying the need for defense facilities owned by the 
government and operated by private contractors

the soviet union continues to buy us grain 
under a recently extended longterm agreement between the two 
countries including a new deal for 420000 metric tons of wheat at 
subsidized prices the agriculture department said thursday 
christopher e goldthwait acting general sales manager for the 
departments foreign agricultural service said the wheat was part 
of 2 million tons authorized dec 23 under the export enhancement 
program or eep 
goldthwait said the wheat is for shipment in january counting 
some wheat left over from previous eep arrangements the soviets 
have about 16 million tons still available under the program 
the soviet union bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under 
eep arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement the 
pact expired sept 30 but was later extended for another year 
department officials said also the soviets bought an additional 
314256 tons of us corn that had previously been reported by 
exporters as headed for unknown destinations the corn sales are 
not subsidized 
with the latest sales the soviets have bought about 104 million 
tons of us corn for delivery in the sixth year of the supply 
agreement 
the eep arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other 
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in 
order to meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
last year us corn sales to the soviet union totaled slightly 
less than 52 million tons wheat sales in 198788 all subsidized 
totaled slightly more than 9 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 420000 tons of 
wheat would be about 154 million bushels the latest corn sales 
would be about 124 million bushels 
wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around 4 per 
bushel according to recent usda market figures making the new sale 
worth an estimated 62 million the corn at 260 per bushel could 
have a farm value of about 32 million 
besides the corn and wheat for 198889 delivery under the pact 
the soviets have ordered 450000 tons of soybeans and 1132500 tons 
of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of grain sorghum 
goldthwaite said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy 
rate of 2175 per ton or about 59 cents per bushel he said the 
bonuses on the 420000 tons of wheat will be paid to three 
companies cargill inc 120000 tons continental grain co 
250000 and richco grain ltd 50000

a gay midshipmen who says he was forced to 
resign from the naval academy after admitting his homosexuality two 
months before his scheduled graduation asked a federal court on 
thursday to order his reinstatement 
joseph c steffan 24 of moorhead minn claimed in the suit 
filed in us district court that his forced separation from the 
academy violated his constitutional rights of free speech due 
process and equal protection under the law 
paula l ettelbrick legal director for the lambda legal defense 
and education fund a homosexual rights advocacy group acting as 
steffans legal counsel said that to her knowledge the suit is 
the first of its kind against a service academy 
steffan now employed by a computer software company in fargo 
nd acknowledged that he was aware of a provision in the 
midshipmens manual that homosexuals would be dismissed from the 
academy 
although steffan said that he realized by the end of his 
sophomore year that he was homosexual he tried to keep it apart 
from his life as a midshipman until he was informed in march 1987 
that he was being investigated by the navy 
at the time steffan was a battalion commander in charge of 
onesixth of the academys 4500 midshipmen a solo performer with 
the academy glee club and in the top 10 percent of his class 
according to the suit 
upon learning of the navy investigation steffan said he admitted 
to a chaplain and then to the academys commandant capt hw 
habermeyer jr that we was a homosexual 
within eight days a brigade performance board and an academic 
board on the annapolis md campus recommended steffans discharge 
after determining that he had an insufficient aptitude for a 
navy officers commission according to the suit 
the boards said my evaluations were completely irrelevant 
steffan said at a news conference here thursday all they needed 
to have was that i was gay they never even looked at my record 
steffan said he agreed to submit a qualified resignation rather 
than fight a dismissal because of stress that his situation was 
causing his family and because his father was suffering from high 
blood pressure at the time 
the suit names defense secretary frank carlucci and navy 
secretary william ball in addition to the naval academys 
superintendent and commandant as defendants 
jay fromer a spokesman for the naval academy said the school 
only abided by navy regulations 
since we are a part of the department of the navy we are bound 
by navy regulations which state homosexuality is incompatible with 
military service fromer said 
in the suit steffan is seeking readmission to the academy a 
diploma from it and a commission in the navy but he conceded the 
unlikelihood of winning the latter by the time the case winds its 
way through the courts 
if im 30 years old at the time im not going to be in much of 
a position to go in as an ensign he said my goal is not only 
to get a diploma but to have this policy of discimination reversed

the closing of the presidio army base on a 
hillside overlooking the golden gate bridge could transform one of 
the citys loveliest spots into a park at the cost of thousands of 
civilian jobs 
the presidio was one of 34 military bases recommended for closing 
by a government commission thursday the panel also said the navy 
should not base the uss missouri at hunters point an issue that has 
divided the city for years 
the recommendation to close the presidio surprised and 
disappointed city officials and neighborhood businessmen even 
though the commission said the move would have minimal impact on 
local employment 
founded by the spanish in 1776 and operated as an army base since 
1846 the presidio is one of the most important spots in san 
francisco history now headquarters of the 6th army it employs 
about 3000 civilians and 2700 servicemen 
i think it will have a significant effect on the economy unless 
the commission is definite in recommending that there be economic 
assistance to communities near bases said rep nancy pelosi a 
democrat whose district is next to the presidio 
the base she said is the thirdlargest employer in san 
francisco and has an annual payroll of 600 million 
its bad we need this base i hope it doesnt happen said 
bill wakileh a delicatessen owner who estimated that half his 
business over the past 20 years has come from the nearby base 
mayor art agnos said the commissions decision had very grave 
consequences for the city he planned to meet with the local 
congressional delegation to evaluate the effect of losing the base 
for 112 years the presidio has been an integral part of san 
francisco it was here before san francisco was a city its been a 
very good neighbor and an important part of our economy he 
said 
the sites future is restricted by the 1972 law that established 
the golden gate national recreation area which includes most of the 
base 
except for 36 acres belonging to the letterman army medical 
center all 1490 acres would come under the control of the park 
the hospital also is slated for closing 
commercial development would not be allowed on the property said 
brian oneill the park area superintendent open space 
recreational and educational use and preservation of historic 
buildings at the base would be the most likely uses he said 
servicemen and civilians at the presidio were apprehensive about 
the prospect of leaving what many consider the most beautiful 
military base in the nation the site of last years film the 
presidio starring sean connery and mark harmon 
its long been considered a prime assignment its sort of 
a combination military office building museum and park all rolled 
into one said jim hudgins presidio chief of community relations 
the base is mostly open to the public and is often the scene of 
bicycle races running events and picnics thousands of people 
gather there every fourth of july to watch fireworks over san 
francisco bay 
in its proposal to close the base the commission said the 
presidio has no space for expansion and the letterman hospital needs 
structural repairs closure would save 741 million a year the 
committee estimated 
the panel also said hamilton army airfield in marin county the 
airfield for the presidio and a training center for reserve units 
should be shut down 
the navy it said should drop plans to base a battleship at the 
hunters point naval shipyard on the bay a base was to be built 
there if the navy decided that the area should be the home port for 
the missouri and its group 
the proposal to make san francisco the battleship groups base 
generated heavy debate in november voters narrowly passed a 
proposition supporting the basing plan 
missouri supporters said the battleship group would pump millions 
of dollars into the citys economy and provide hundreds of jobs

some instruments have failed on board a satellite 
headed for the martian moon phobos but the mission is not in 
jeopardy the soviet news agency tass reported thursday 
the soviets have lost the first of the pair of probes phobos i 
and phobos ii heading for mars reports from the united states this 
week said the second satellite also was experiencing problems 
putting the entire project in danger 
routine equipment checks revealed isolated malfunctions in some 
of the instruments on board phobos ii tass said 
but it quoted garri rogovsky of the babakin research and testing 
center in kaliningrad as saying that most have been rectified 
while the rest wont prevent the research program from being carried 
out in full 
phobos i was launched on july 7 but in september a wrong 
computer command caused it to stop responding to commands from earth 
and it was lost 
phobos ii launched days later continues on course toward mars 
it is to enter a mars orbit late next month and approach the moon 
phobos in april 
its package of instruments and experiments were prepared by a 
group of 12 countries and by the european space agency but the 
project is especially valuable to the soviet union because soviet 
scientists are aiming for a manned mission to mars early in the 21st 
century 
tass said phobos i and phobos ii carried almost identical 
equipment but the lost probe carried instruments to register 
neutron radiation from phobos surface and to study mars magnetic 
field not included on phobos ii 
on approaching mars phobos ii will take infrared and gamma ray 
readings compile a temperature map and data on its mineral makeup 
atmosphere and ionosphere tass said 
moving on to phobos it will drop to within 165 feet to analyze 
the martian moons soil with the help of a laser and then drop two 
small landing craft onto the moons surface

the labor department will hold hearings in 
february and march on lifting a world war iiera regulation that 
bars apparel manufacturers from employing seamstresses in their 
homes officials said thursday 
the department will publish in fridays edition of the federal 
register an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking as the first 
formal step for lifting the ban said allan mcmillan a deputy 
assistant labor secretary in charge of enforcing the prohibition 
presidentelect bush urged the action last october after the 
labor department won approval from the white house budget office to 
remove homework prohibitions in five other apparel fields effective 
jan 8 
in a letter to labor secretary ann mclaughlin two weeks before 
the election bush said he had been assured that the last piece of 
this rulemaking will be given top priority for clearance 
mcmillan said the labor department will hold hearings on the 
proposal in miami on feb 2223 in san antonio texas on march 
23 and in chicago on march 89 
the department believes that changing demographics such as more 
women working demand increased workforce flexibility including the 
option to work in ones home he said the current ban 
forecloses that possibility 
the prohibitions on apparel industry homework were imposedin 1942 
to combat widespread exploitation of immigrants and other lowwage 
workers lifting them has been the reagan administrations top 
deregulatory proposal in the labor relations area for the past 
several years 
the administration succeed in 1984 in removing the ban on knitted 
outerwear but was thwarted by court rulings in response to suits 
from unions in lifting the prohibitions in six other apparel fields 
however two days after the election the labor department 
announced it was removing the prohibitions effective jan 8 in 
five apparel fields gloves and mittens embroideries buttons and 
buckles handkerchiefs and some jewelry 
the labor department estimates between 9000 and 100000 workers 
are employed in those five industries compared with up to 500000 
in womens apparel 
the international ladies garment workers union which represents 
some 170000 workers said last week it will seek a court injunction 
next week to prohibit the further removal of any of the remaining 
bans on homework

girls mother jacqueline valente five belgians also captured 
aboard the yacht silco and a baby sister born in captivity 
marielaure betille 7 and her 6yearold sister virginie 
landed at a military base in istres near marseille in a government 
plane with their father pascal betille a spokeswoman for the 
foreign ministry said 
they came from the libyan capital of tripoli where the girls 
were handed over to french officials 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi who bankrolls the guerrilla 
faction had called for the girls release on christmas eve 
later thursday libyas official jana news agency quoted gadhafi 
as calling for the release of all hostages 
once again i ask the fatahrevolutionary council and the rest 
of the liberation movements in the middle east to respond to my 
appeal for the release of the remaining hostages on this holy 
occasion gadhafi was quoted as saying in apparent reference to 
christmas 
in paris the foreign ministry said france welcomes this 
humanitarian gesture in appropriate measure and it thanks 
foreign authorities who contributed the statement did not 
elaborate 
the guerrilla groups spokesman walid khaled said in a 
statement issued in beirut lebanon that the release was a gift 
to the french authorities all french political parties the french 
people and president francois mitterrand in the name of the 
children of palestine the children of the revolution of the stones 
on the occasion of christmas and new year he was referring to the 
yearold uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip 
jana said the girls received medical examinations and were found 
to enjoy good health

a piece of shell jewelry once hailed as a 
10000yearold indian relic depicting a woolly mammoth is really 
about 1000 years old and was found in the last century by a shady 
amateur archaeologist an anthropologist says 
david meltzer of southern methodist university called the carving 
resembling the animal that became extinct 10000 years ago a 
mammoth fraud he spent eight years researching the history of 
the piece a handsize whelk shell pendant and used carbon 14 
dating to determine its age 
the pendant was rediscovered in the 1970s by smithsonian 
institution researchers who found it in a drawer where it 
apparently had lain since the end of the 19th century 
it had been produced by hilbourne t cresson as a discovery hed 
made in northern delaware near holly oak but for some reason the 
artifact known as the holly oak pendant was forgotten about for 
decades meltzer said 
by the time it was noticed again archaeologists had proven that 
humans lived with woolly mammoths in the western hemisphere at 
least in the new mexico area it had been known since 1864 that man 
lived at the same time as the beasts in europe that was the year 
that a mammoth tusk was found at la madeliene france with etchings 
on it 
in may 1976 science magazine carried an article attributed to 
john c kraft a geologist at the university of delaware that the 
pendant could be authentic but one year later he told another 
journal the piece might be a fraud 
when metzler began his investigation in 1981 he found cresson 
claimed to have found the pendant in 1864 but told no one about it 
until 1889 the researcher checked newspaper microfilms that might 
have clues about cresson 
when the microfilm came back i was flabbergasted meltzer 
said according to frontpage stories cresson blew his brains 
out in a new york city park one report quoted his suicide note as 
saying he was suspected of counterfeiting and was being followed by 
secret service agents 
metzler learned that cresson had studied art and archaeology in 
france about the time of the la madeliene discovery the more we 
learned about cresson the more suspicious we got he said the 
carbon dating measuring the amount of radioactive carbon 14 left in 
the pendant was the final confirmation

the noontime peal of church bells thursday 
implored peruvians to interrupt their activities and pray for an end 
to a vicious leftist insurgency that has bloodied perus landscape 
and shrouded its future 
police and fire sirens roared and many motorists stopped their 
cars and honked in lima and other cities to usher in a minute of 
silence for peace 
thousands elsewhere in lima froze in their tracks on downtown and 
suburban streets for a moment of private reflection but many others 
others went about their business ignoring the event 
officials say nearly 2000 people have died in the leftist 
insurgency of the shining path guerrilla group since the first 
nationwide peace vigil was held exactly one year ago 
too much blood has been spilled this is both a silent 
invitation and the clamor of the multitudes we want peace 
cardinal juan landazuri said in a nationally televised speech 
limas municipal palace where landazuri spoke in a ceremony 
attended by dozens of the nations leaders was guarded by scores of 
heavily armed police a stark reminder of the possibility of a 
terror attack 
riot police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse a noon 
march near the municipal palace of about 300 members of the 
confederation of state laborers said reporters on the scene 
the protesters said they were marching to demand that authorities 
release a confederation leader arrested three weeks ago police have 
denied the man was detained 
in the highland where rebel violence has been heaviest 
thursdays vigil passed unheeded in ayacucho 225 miles southeast of 
lima but church bells rang and sirens wailed in huancayo 125 miles 
east of lima witnesses said 
the protest against terrorism came as peru faces a severe 
economic recession inflation is expected to hit 1800 percent this 
year 
a recent report by the senates commission on violence said the 
economic woes and the insurgency and repressive countermeasures by 
government forces were undermining perus democracy 
the commission said the roots of the insurgency are imbedded in 
centuries of hatred and discrimination between perus rich and poor 
along with increasing reports of violence since october 
newspapers daily carry stories on factory shutdowns layoffs a 
dramatic fall in public spending power and growing lines for basic 
foods 
perus general crisis brings us toward decisive years during 
which our revolution will accelerate powerfully the leader and 
founder of the shining path abimael guzman said recently during 
his only published interview since the fighting began 
guzman launched the insurgency to topple perus elected 
government and install marxist rule in may 1980 
since then the fighting has killed more than 12000 people and 
has spread throughout the central highlands down to the major 
coastal cities and into the eastern jungle 
among those slain this year were one american and two french 
agricultural development workers the first foreigners known to have 
been executed purposely by the guerrillas 
to counter the guerrillas the government has installed states of 
emergency giving the military broad policing and governing powers 
in eight states where more than half of perus 21 million people 
live 
both the londonbased amnesty international and the new 
yorkbased americas watch sharply criticized peruvian authorities in 
reports this year for tolerating human rights violations

the stepped up security measures for us 
airliners around the world announced by the federal aviation 
administration on thursday are directed primarily against one type 
of bomb that has so far defied all detection methods plastic 
explosives 
the faa announced it is requiring tightened security by us air 
carriers at 103 airports in the middle east and western europe 
including xray or physical inspection of all checked baggage and 
random physical checks of some carryon baggage 
investigators sifting through the debris of pan am flight 103 
which crashed last week in scotland have determined that a powerful 
plastic bomb blew up the giant boeing 747 killing its 259 occupants 
and 11 people on the ground 
attention has focused on one type of plastic explosive which has 
been used in the past with frightening success by arab terrorists 
an odorless orange substance known as semtex 
its a favorite with these groups because its significantly 
harder to detect than anything else its more powerful than other 
plastics said george carver a senior cia analyst for many years 
and now a researcher at the center for strategic and international 
studies 
czechoslovakia a communist country which has a welldeveloped 
staterun arms and munitions industry makes semtex at a plant 
called the eastern bohemian works us state department officials 
say they have asked the czechs to desist from production of semtex 
or at least to prevent its export 
recently czechoslovakia indicated it might be willing to stop 
selling semtex said neil livingstone who has served as a 
consultant to government security and intelligence agencies and has 
written seven books on international security and terrorism 
czechoslovakia is believed to have supplied semtex to syria and 
libya said one state department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the united states also makes plastic explosives for use by the 
military but those substances known as c4 are not available to 
commercial users such as dynamiting contractors 
like c4 semtex is malleable like putty and shows up on an xray 
operators screen as an indistinguishable dense mass but unlike c4 
and other known plastic bombs semtex is completely odorless 
semtex also has the advantage of being stable meaning it cannot 
go off unless it is meant to 
conventional xray machines as well as bomb sniffing dogs have 
so far been thwarted by semtex and c4 but researchers have come up 
with what they say is a nearly foolproof response 
the machine goes by the name of thermal neutron analysis device 
or tna and is about twice the size of an airport xray machine 
during the yearlong test in the los angeles and san francisco 
airports under a contract from the faa it demonstrated a 95 percent 
detection rate with few false alarms the agency said 
as part of the new security measures announced thursday the faa 
said it is accelerating by six months the delivery of more tnas 
under the accelerated program the first unit will be in operation 
next summer and the last of five perhaps six will be operational 
by the beginning of 1990 
the agency said it had not been decided where to place the 
thermal neutron equipment which could go into airports either in 
the united states or overseas or a combination of the two each unit 
costs 750000 to 1 million 
according to the faa the device is capable of scanning a piece 
of luggage in six seconds and can be adapted for use with a conveyor 
system that could handle large numbers of baggage in relatively 
short periods of time with a low rate of false alarms 
lee grodzins an faa consultant said that until now there was 
no impetus there was no public demand to put them into airports 
but the pan am disaster has provided the impetus to move the tnas 
from the experimental to the operational stage 
the faa with a nudge from congress stepped up its development 
of bomb detection devices after a terrorist bomb apparently caused 
an airindia jumbo jet to crash off the irish coast in l985 and a 
bomb detonated aboard a trans world airlines jet over the 
mediterranean in 1986 killing four americans 
the twa bombing was determined to have been caused by semtex and 
carried out by a palestinian faction known as the may 15 
organization 
semtex also was the culprit in a foiled attempt sponsored by the 
syrian government to blow up an israeli el al airliner at londons 
heathrow airport in 1986

the israeli government said thursday that the 
palestine liberation organization set the examples for all terrorist 
groups which attack civilian airplanes and their passengers 
a statement titled plo the first of its kind did not 
directly link yassar arafats group to the bombing of pan am flight 
103 the boeing 747 jetliner that crashed last week in scotland and 
killed all 259 aboard and an estimated 11 people on the ground 
but the statement released by the israeli embassy said all 
terrorist groups that have targeted civil aviation in recent years 
learned from one source the plo 
arafats organization was the first to hijack an airplane an el 
al fight in 1968 the first to destroy a plane in midair a swissair 
flight to israel in 1970 and the first to carry out a 
gunandgrenade attack on passengers an el al plane in greece in 
1968 the statement said 
internationalist terrorist organizations have learned from the 
plo in other areas as well the embassy said it cited the murder 
of 11 israeli athletes at the olympics in munich west germany and 
the seizure of the israeli embassy in bangkok thailand also in 
1972 
us investigators so far have been unable to pinpoint the person 
or group that placed a bomb aboard the pan am plane at least two 
radical palestinian organizations both outside the plo are among a 
wide spectrum of possible suspects these are the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command and the al fatah 
revolutionary council headed by abu nidal 
the plo has throughout the years develped links and cooperated 
at times very closely with other terror organizations the 
israeli statement said providing them with funds arms training 
and operational assistance 
in the middle east it said abu nidal and others used terror 
methods which they first learned from the plo before breaking away 
to form their own groups 
the plo itself has not ended its own campaign of terror but 
has only redefined the direction range and tactical form of the 
armed struggle which is another definition of terror and violence 
sanctioned by the plo the statement said from earlier years to 
more recent attacks plo violence shows that when it comes to 
terrorism the plo wrote the book 
secretary of state george p shultz accused the plo of terrorism 
last month as he denied arafat a visa to speak to the un general 
assembly in new york he called the plo chairman an accessory to 
terrorism 
subsequently arafat said he renounced terrorism in all forms 
and shultz approved us talks with the plo the first authorized by 
the united states in 13 years 
the first session was held dec 16 in carthage tunisia 
afterward assistant secretary of state richard w murphy and other 
senior reagan administration officials cautioned the plo the 
substantive dialogue would be terminated if acts of terrorism 
were traced to arafats organization 
there have been no us accusations against the plo since

interest rates soared in israel on thursday as 
skepticism grew over the governments decision to devalue the shekel 
the bank of israel the central bank raised its lending rate to 
banks and other large financial institutions to 4825 percent a 
year compared to 328 percent a week ago 
the rate is high because of israels high inflation rate 
bank leumi the nations largest commercial bank raised its 
basic lending rate to 2 percent a month from 15 percent other 
financial institutions were expected to follow suit 
israel radio said people are panicked and many believe 
further devaluation is imminent 
the central bureau of statistics published more bad news at a 
news conference thursday 
it estimated that israels gross national product the value of 
all goods and services produced in the economy grew 1 percent this 
year down from 52 percent in 1987 figures were adjusted for 
inflation 
ezra hadar director of the bureaus national accounts division 
told reporters the slowdown reflected declines in industrial 
production and agricultural output as well as sideeffects from the 
yearold palestinian uprising in the occupied territories 
palestinians boycotted israelimade products and some quit jobs 
in israel reducing the output of industries like textiles and 
construction 
hadar estimated the uprising cost 300 million in sales and 
cancellation of the israelibuilt lavi fighter jet reduced sales 
another 300 million 
israel s unemployment rate was above 7 percent compared to 61 
percent last year he said 
the government on tuesday devalued the shekel by 5 percent in an 
effort to stem a speculative buying binge of foreign currencies 
that lowered the currency to 1680 shekels to the dollar from 
1599 
purchases of foreign currencies especially the dollar slowed to 
70 million from 80 million on wednesday and a record 135 million 
on tuesday said bank of israel spokesman amnon yakobi 
critics say the devaluation is inflationary and badly timed 
throwing off yearend closing of corporate balance sheets 
business leaders believe a larger devaluation is needed next year 
to bring the shekel more in line with us and european currencies 
zvi amit of the federation of chambers of commerce said companies 
with foreign currency debts have had to revalue them upward by 5 
percent in shekels reducing their profits for the year 
it hurts their credit lines it hurts their efforts to attract 
investment it hurts all around amit said

eastern airlines trying to counter a wave of 
negative publicity said thursday it will regularly use electrical 
current devices to detect the tiniest of gaps in the bodies of older 
boeing 727s 
we had an unfortunate incident and we are responding said 
joseph b leonard executive vice president referring to mondays 
emergency landing of an eastern boeing 727 in charleston wva 
with a 14inch tear in its fuselage 
after the incident in which two people suffered minor injures 
the airline visually inspected the 46 oldest of its 111 727s those 
with 30000 or more landings 
ed upton eastern vice president for maintenance and engineering 
said that currently the airline inspects its planes visually when 
it suspects a crack in an obscure place it uses electrical 
detectors known as eddycurrent devices 
upton said the devices have been recalibrated to go deeper into 
the metal and detect a gap of one130000th of an inch and will be 
used on older boeings on a regular basis 
how often depends on results of the electrical inspection of the 
46 oldest jets he said 
the rivettorivet testing will be conducted on a 100inchlong 
stretch of the planes from about the last row of seats to the rear 
door the 22yearold plane that tore open monday developed the hole 
in the roof near the tail 
a boeing 727 was grounded in boston on monday after a threeinch 
crack was discovered near the tail on wednesday eastern maintenance 
workers in miami found corrosion near fuselage rivets on a 727 the 
company also disclosed that cracks were found in a mcdonnell douglas 
dc9 during an unrelated previously begun industrywide inspection 
of dc9 planes with 55000 or more landings 
leonard said tiny nonhazardous cracks are found in aircraft 
every day during routine inspections 
this is not an easternexclusive problem its absolutely 
consistent with the industry leonard said 
he also said the age of the aircraft was being overemphasized and 
he said a planes age doesnt necessarily affect its safety 
the tear on the flight monday was from inside an overlap of 
aluminum on the fuselage a new twist upton said the routine 
visual inspections conducted after 1100 landings couldnt detect 
such insideout tearing he said 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said it will take about a 
month for the electrical testing to be completed on the 46 planes 
by then the company would know better the cause of the tear that 
forced mondays emergency landing and will adjust its maintenance 
program accordingly she said 
the federal aviation administration will propose in january that 
operators of older 727s be required to replace some rivets agency 
spokesman dave duff said wednesday duff said it had not been 
determined how many airplanes would be covered

pease air force base where george bush 
arrives when he visits maine is one of the biggest installations 
put on the chopping block thursday and officials hunted for ways to 
soften the 340 million shock 
news that the 33yearold base home to some of the countrys top 
bomber groups might close as soon as january 1990 shocked many 
people in the state 
the base employs 3700 military personnel and 500 civilians 
there also are an estimated 1700 secondary jobs stemming from the 
base and the closing is expected to cost 340 million to the 
economy within a 100mile radius 
base commander col orin godsey said local officials were 
amazed and i dont think they expected it when he met with them 
to break the news its like a lot of other communities in the 
united states today because no one ever wants to think they will be 
on the closure list 
the commission on base realignment and closure proposed that 34 
military installations be closed it also recommended partially 
closing five other bases and reorganizing 54 more that would get new 
missions and additional personnel 
godsey said despite the shock local officials had a very 
positive outlook theyre looking at ways they can make the military 
base a usable installation 
one of the most frequently mentioned ideas was to convert the 
base into a regional airport 
the states congressional delegation who supported creation of 
the commission said they would not fight the closing if it is 
justified 
i dont want to raise false expectations about altering this 
recommendation said sen gordon humphrey a conservative 
republican at this juncture it looks like a foregone conclusion 
that it will close its highly unlikely that congress will reject 
this list 
if theres a good case to be made to close pease so be it 
military bases arent forever 
rep robert smith another conservative republican said he and 
the rest of the delegation planned to meet with people in the state 
to acertain their feelings if they want me to fight it ill 
fight it he said 
the commission recommended closing pease because of a shortage of 
facilities at the base and its vulnerability to sublaunched 
ballistic missiles that could strike before its planes get off the 
ground the panel said 
pease opened in 1956 and has been home of the 509th bombardment 
wing whose predecessor the 509th composite group of the army air 
corps dropped the bomb on hiroshima 
in 1985 pease was listed in the book nuclear battlefields as 
having 190 atomic warheads ranking new hampshire 21st among the 
states the federal government does not acknowledge where it keeps 
its nuclear weapons 
since its founding pease has been a base for b29 b52 and b47 
bombers today it deploys kc135 refueling tankers and fb111 
fighter bombers

a brother of a pan am crewman came 
seeking a bible on thursday from the church near the spot where the 
cockpit of flight 103 fell 
i said he could take the bibles or take anything else he 
thought might help said the rev cameron gibson of tundergarth 
parish church he had free rein to take what he wanted 
the brother wanted to take the bible to his old mother in 
america as a memento of near where her son had died gibson said 
the country church is three miles east of lockerbie where the 
jumbo jet crashed dec 21 killing all 259 people aboard and leaving 
11 people on the ground missing and presumed dead 
investigators said the crash was caused by a bomb in the cargo 
hold 
john wagner brother of first officer raymond wagner 52 of 
pennington nj had approached police in lockerbie about obtaining 
two prayer books 
gibson said there were no prayer books in the calvinist church of 
scotland but that he was welcome to take king james bibles 
the bodies of wagner and pilot james bruce macquarrie 55 of 
kensington nh were among the first to be released this week to 
nextofkin 
royal engineers using circular saws cut the nose of the plane 
into sections for transport to the air accident investigation 
branchs facility in farnborough in southern england 
the nose still displaying the planes designation clipper maid 
of the seas is the largest piece of wreckage and one of the few 
immediately recognizable as part of an aircraft 
the engineers and members of the royal highland fusiliers are 
billeted in the tundergarth church the nose fell just beyond the 
churchyard wall 
several relatives of the dead came to the site with flowers on 
thursday 
despite the disaster the church went ahead with its christmas 
service one of the most difficult i have ever had to prepare in 
the 26 years of my ministry gibson said 
the only thing i could possibly tell them was god was with us 
gibson like other ministers and priests in the area has taken 
on an unexpected burden of counseling griefstricken parishioners 
and relatives of the dead 
social workers who have also been counseling townspeople say they 
have encountered some who refused to face up to the disaster 
we are experiencing a typical part of the scots personality 
which says we dont want help said tom mcmenamy director of 
the regional department of social work 
people are denying the event happened at all and we have got to 
make sure they dont stay like that 
the fact it was a bomb gives them a focus for anger they know 
now how it happened but they dont know who did it but it is much 
healthier to know how something happened 
it may be months before the town of 2500 people regains its 
normal appearance john orr the detective who is heading a criminal 
investigation based in lockerbie said he was prepared for a long 
and painstaking operation 
as the search continues helicopters are frequently overhead and 
military and rescue vehicles jam the streets 
outside the town hall being used as a temporary morgue the pile 
of flowers from relatives of the dead and from sympathizers in 
several countries has grown daily 
in private meetings arranged for residents of damaged areas 
several people have complained about being questioned by some of the 
dozens of reporters on the scene according to a local newspaper 
the annandale herald 
theres been no christmas in lockerbie one young man said 
wednesday night as he edged away from a camera crew i dont want 
to talk about it no one wants to talk about it 
leslie jardine a spokesman for the social work department said 
nearly 360000 had been collected for relief work in lockerbie 
more than half that amount came from pan am and its insurer 
the local parish of the church of scotland is planning a memorial 
service jan 4 and arrangements have been made to seat expected 
overflow crowds in other halls and churches 
the rev john owen a church of scotland minister from nearby 
lochmaben wrote in the reflections column of the annandale 
herald that there were no easy answers to the disaster 
if you want truth take your coat off and sit down this will 
take whatever time truth takes he wrote 
there is a time for everything and when the time comes to 
speak of other things we will now we need to give ourselves a time 
to mourn

after her premature birth has become widely known through her

israels deputy foreign minister on thursday 
sought to tie the plo to the bombing of pan am flight 103 and blamed 
the us decision to talk to the guerrilla organization for 
encouraging international terrorism 
the statement by binyamin netanyahu a leading member of prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc follows repeated israeli 
criticism of the united states for including yasser arafat and the 
palestine liberation organization in the middle east peace process 
by having these kinds of talks you are sending a message a 
very clear message that terrorism pays netanyahu told a news 
conference the american talks with the plo have seriously 
weakenened the american effort against terrorism 
he said suspicion in the dec 21 pan am bombing focused on groups 
experienced with the type of explosives used in the blast including 
the plo and syria 
however he said he had no firm information on who was to blame 
for the bombing and an israeli security expert said arafats 
mainstream plo faction was not a likely candidate 
netanyahus comments echoed shamirs who suggested tuesday that 
washingtons decision was encouraging renewed infiltration attacks 
along the israeli border shamir said the american move encouraged 
the tendency of violent acts against israel 
a government source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
earlier this week that a major israeli foreign policy goal would be 
to reverse washingtons decision to talk to the plo 
on thursday netanyahu called the plo the foremost practitioner 
of aviation terrorism it was responsible for the first airliner 
hijacking the first destruction of a passenger plane in midair and 
the first gun and grenade attack on passengers he said 
i say the plo i mean fatah i mean arafat he said 
referring to the plo chiefs mainstream guerrilla group 
netanyahu spoke at a news conference called to announce an 
international seminar on airline security in february in tel aviv 
the conference focused on the bombing of the pan am jet over 
scotland in which more than 260 people died in the air and on the 
ground 
ariel merari an israeli terrorism expert told reporters at the 
news conference that he doubted the mainstream plo would have 
carried out the attack when arafat is making statements about peace 
with israel 
i dont think the present political situation is such that the 
plo would sponsor such an attack he said my guess is at least 
for a while theyll refrain from international terrorism because it 
is politically counterproductive 
merari director of a project on terrorism at tel aviv 
university said earlier he believed the pan am attackers probably 
were radical plo factions opposed to arafats more moderate stands 
he said it was such splinter groups that actually carried out the 
first hijacking and first blowing up of a plane in midair not 
arafats fatah 
israel began criticizing the united states after secretary of 
state george shultz announced dec 14 that the plo had met american 
demands for inclusion in the peace process by recognizing israel and 
renouncing terrorism 
israels new government included in its political program a 
refusal to negotiate with the plo which it views as a terrorist 
organization

thabo moloi 17 had his 
picture printed on the front page of the sowetan newspaper thursday 
the only high school student in the township of 25 million to 
graduate with a b grade average 
there were no a students among the 4508 who took their final 
examinations in soweto only five of all south africas black 
students had a averages 
nationwide 574 percent of the 170966 fulltime black high 
school students who wrote final exams passed a slight improvement 
over last years 569 percent in soweto 378 percent of all high 
school seniors passed an increase over last years 32 percent 
there is no reason to believe that black children are less 
intelligent than whites but year after year the black 
matriculation results are disastrous said the sowetan in an 
editorial 
the sensible view surely should be to improve black education 
blacks will outnumber whites in everincreasing numbers as we reach 
the turn of the century black skills will be needed with 
everincreasing desperation the sowetan said 
in the 1950s under legislation supporting the apartheid system 
of race separation the white government instituted an inferior 
education system for blacks and prohibited them from attending 
missionary and other private schools where most of todays black 
leaders received their education 
today the government says its standards for black education are 
the same as for whites but since resources are allocated by race 
the amount of money spent on a white childs education is five times 
that spent on a black 
black schools also have been wracked by boycotts since nationwide 
unrest broke out in 1984 although there was no boycott this year 
graduating students had years of material with which to catch up 
another disadvantage is that many of their teachers themselves have 
not passed the high school graduation examination

prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski told 
poland in a televised address that fighting inflation will be the 
governments top priority next year and he appealed to consumers 
not to hoard scarce goods 
he also noted in a wednesday night broadcast that the countrys 
economic reform policy is based on competition some people would be 
better off under the reforms but others would lose ground he 
cautioned 
we of course have to be aware of this problem we have to put 
on the agenda the problem of caring for the weakest he said 
rakowski said the government hopes to limit inflation to 20 
percent next year however officially published estimates have 
projected an overall inflation rate of 50 percent in 1989 compared 
with 60 to 70 percent in 1988 
incomes have outstripped available supplies consumer hoarding of 
limited goods such as gasoline and paper supplies exacerbates 
shortages in stores 
rakowski appealed to poles to observe the principle of reason 
it is necessary to limit demand in our conditions he said 
i think i should ask citizens not to stock up needlessly it 
really makes no sense 
rakowski was making the fifth in a series of informal tv 
addresses since he became premier sept 27

nearly 3yearold case 
the paper quoted chief detective hans olvebro as saying a number 
of weapons were testfired to compare the slugs with those found at 
the scene of the assassination only some were ruled out as the 
murder weapon he said

had access to the pistols dagens nyheter said 
pettersson who has a long history of violent crime and of drug 
and alcohol abuse was to remain in custody until friday

an inmate who says the state is turning 
prisoners into tv addicts failed in a bid to have televisions banned 
behind bars 
wisconsin prisons are chockfull of inmates who are completely 
addicted to television soap operas and all adrian lomax an 
inmate at an oshkosh prison said in a letter to the milwaukee 
journal most male inmates spend almost all their free time 
watching television 
without television inmates would be more likely to better 
themselves and develop the tools necessary to become productive 
members of society he said 
warden don gudmanson rejected the complaint filed nov 7 and an 
appeal to the state health and social services secretary also 
failed gudmanson said television has a pacifying influence and 
gives inmates something to do in their idle time 
i dont think the inmates are any more addicted to tv than 
anyone else in the community i think watching television is a 
healthy release gudmanson said thursday i dont know of any 
prison in the country that doesnt allow personal televisions 
about 40 percent of the 400 inmates at oshkosh have personal tv 
sets which are permitted as long as the screen is no larger than 13 
inches and speakers are disconnected and headphones used tv sets 
are also in the prison day rooms 
lomax who is serving a life sentence for murder taught himself 
spanish while behind bars and his prison job is translating prison 
manuals into spanish for hispanic inmates he had predicted his 
request would not get far 
a frequent filer of inmate complaints lomax has three others 
pending but officials said they are kept confidential unless 
revealed by the inmate 
hes come up with a lot of good ideas but hes come up with 
some bad ones too gudmanson said

predictions ranged from economic disaster to inconvenience as 
communities speculated thursday on how they would be affected by a 
federal commissions recommendation to close or reorganize 145 
military installations 
for towns whose military bases were spared or even slated to 
expand the commissions report brought unalloyed relief 
the commission called for closing 34 installations partially 
closing five others and reorganizing 54 others that would get new 
missions and additional personnel the panel said the measures would 
save 56 billion over 20 years 
california was the state most affected by the commission on base 
realignment and closure report which recommended that six 
installations be shut norton george and mather air force bases 
the presidio army base hamilton army air field and the salton sea 
test base 
plans to build hunters point naval station at san francisco also 
would be scrapped if the panels report is approved by congress 
the closure of mather will certainly have an adverse economic 
impact on our community said paul salemi a sacramento 
metropolitan chamber of commerce official if you look at an 
industry that employs close to 7000 people and has a payroll of 
154 million what else can you say 
the shutdown of george an air base in the desert 70 miles 
northeast of los angeles would signal hard times for the 
surrounding communities where the base contributes an estimated 
516 million to the economy said us rep jerry lewis 
i would dread the fiscal impact it would have on the entire 
high desert said adelanto city administrator pat chamberlaine 
we just wont survive said anita hilton a longtime employee 
of wright cleaners an establishment adjacent to fort dix nj 
that advertises 3 hour service for fatigues and khakis 
more than 95 percent of our business is army if they cut back 
fort dix well all be looking for new jobs she said 
similar sentiments echoed through wrightstowns fourblock 
downtown strip which begins at the fort dix boundary and includes 
several bars a tatoo parlor fast food restaurants a store called 
gi joes and a barber shop that advertises military haircuts the 
area also has a high school that is being expanded at a cost of 16 
million to serve military families school board president thomas 
bridge said 
new york city which has three military installations within its 
city limits would lose one a largely administrative naval station 
in brooklyn but personnel would simply move to a new base on staten 
island 20 miles away 
on balance it could have been a lot worse said rep guy 
molinari a republican whose district includes the staten island 
port 
for some effects of a facility closing were impossible to 
predict 
weve never been through one of these said col walt siders 
a spokesman for the arizona national guard which operates the 
navajo army depot slated for closing it came as a complete 
surprise when we heard about it on the radio this morning 
salt lake city mayor palmer depaulis said he wasnt surprised the 
commission recommended closing historic fort douglas built in 1862 
to protect stagecoach travelers and keep watch on mormon settlers 
it had long been criticized as contributing little to the 
nations defense 
he said the fort with 44 buildings registered as national 
historic landmarks would be perfect for an olympic village if 
the city is selected as host of the 1998 winter olympic games 
for many the states the commission news was a mix of good and 
bad 
in massachusetts officials and merchants in ayer were relieved 
that the fort devens army base escaped the budget ax but watertown 
residents lamented the passing of an army facility that has been a 
neighbor since the war of 1812 
the army materials technology laboratory in watertown which 
oversees development of metals and other materials for use in 
weapons armor bridges and military structures had long been 
rumored to be on the verge of closing 
harold laye an employee since 1956 said workers regarded former 
house speaker thomas p tip oneill to be the labs protector 
oneill retired two years ago we knew it was coming laye said 
its a sad day 
ayers residents found that fort devens also mentioned as a 
candidate for closing was instead recommended for enlargement i 
think we ought to be celebrating today said ed kelley owner of a 
card shop and a director of the chamber of commerce its the best 
news we could have for a new years 
in virginia cameron station in alexandria and the defense 
mapping agency in herndon were recommended for closing but state 
leaders were relieved that four larger bases considered vulnerable 
were untouched fort monroe in hampton fort pickett in blackstone 
fort lee in petersburg and vint hill farms near warrenton 
fort belvoir in fairfax county was recommended for a major 
expansion 
i am extremely happy said arlene crittenden a dress shop 
owner in hampton roads who had led efforts to save nearby fort 
monroe i dont even care if i sell a dress today she said 
community leaders would go ahead with plans for a party thursday 
night to celebrate the forts survival

the federal aviation administration said 
thursday it is requiring tightened security by us air carriers at 
103 airports in the middle east and western europe including xray 
or physical inspection of all checked baggage and random physical 
checks of some carryon baggage 
the new measures coming in the wake of the dec 21 bombing of 
pan am flight 103 which killed all 259 people on board and 11 people 
on the ground in lockerbie scotland will be effective within 48 
hours and far exceed existing international standards said faa 
administrator t allan mcartor 
many of the new measures already are being followed but until 
now had not been required all the time he said 
the new measures may well result in passenger delays and 
inconvenience mcartor said adding that they could mean 
checkin earlier perhaps as much as an hour 
mcartor said he was not at liberty to discuss how passengers 
would be selected for random inspection of handbaggage or what 
proportion would be chosen for those inspections 
asked why similar measures were not being required at us 
airports mcartor told a news conference the threat appears to be 
more international in scope we are encouraging our carriers to be 
more vigilant domestically 
in addition to the 100 percent inspection of checked baggage and 
the random inspection of carryon baggage here are the main points 
of the faas new program 
passengers may not have access to checked baggage after it has 
cleared security 
airlines must perform positive match of passenger and 
baggage to keep unaccompanied bags off the plane asked what would 
happen if a passenger boarded a plane in frankfurt with a ticket to 
new york but departed the plane at a stop in london ray salazar 
director of the faas office of civil aviation said that persons 
baggage would have to be removed from the plane in london in 
accordance with the already required reconciliation at the 
transfer gate of the passenger and baggage manifests 
additional measures will be required to preclude unauthorized 
access to baggage mcartor did not say what these additional 
measures would be 
parcels shipped through passenger ticket counters also must be 
xrayed or physically examined 
the faa is accelerating by six months the delivery of thermal 
neutron analysis devices which are capable of detecting all known 
explosives even those that are transparent to xrays such as the 
plastic explosives favored by terrorists under the accelerated 
program the first unit will be in operation next summer and the 
last of five perhaps six will be operational by the beginning of 
1990 
mcartor said it had not been decided where to place the thermal 
neutron equipment which could go into airports either in the united 
states or overseas or a combination of the two each unit costs 
750000 to 1 million 
the agencys security inspection staff will be increased by 22 
percent from 550 people to 670 over the next 20 months 
the faa had not computed any estimates of additional costs to the 
airlines for the tightened security arrangements said agency 
spokeswoman joann sloane 
stephen hayes a spokesman for the air transport association an 
organization of the major us air carriers said the airline 
industry will comply fully with the new security initiatives 
however more must be done than simply placing additional 
security requirements on the airlines hayes said the 
government itself must become more directly involved in meeting the 
threat that international terrorism presents 
we believe the faa should assign more of its security personnel 
to europe and the middle east and we believe the faa should impose 
the same security requirements on foreign airlines which serve the 
united states as it imposes on us airlines he said 
mcartor said the new measures overlap and duplicate to a certain 
extent precautions ordered by the british authorities at heathrow 
airport near london that took effect thursday and are quite 
similar to the procedures of el al the best in the world 
el al is the israeli national carrier known for its rigorous 
security precautions it has never suffered a midair explosion 
in april 1986 an arab terrorist gave his unsuspecting girlfriend 
a bomb to carry onto an el al jetliner bound from london to israel 
the plastic explosive was discovered by an israeli security guard at 
heathrow 
ms sloane the faa spokeswoman said the faa did not anticipate 
imposing any additional training requirements for security personnel 
hired by us airlines domestically or overseas

eighteen people including six current or former 
police officers were indicted thursday on 1500 charges in an 
alleged towing scam that bilked at least 600 people from 1982 to 
1987 authorities said 
sgt william h kelley jr 51 head of the boston police auto 
theft unit was charged with six counts of conspiracy perjury and 
writing a false police report according to indictments returned by 
a suffolk county grand jury 
the suspects allegedly participated in several schemes to tow 
legally and illegally parked cars and overcharge owners who 
retrieved them said david rodman a spokesman for suffolk county 
district attorney newman flanagan 
i was very disturbed by the arrogance and disrespectful 
attitude that some police officers had a total disregard for the 
public trust boston police commissioner francis x roache said 
it really sickens me 
also indicted were three other boston police officers one 
metropolitan district commission police officer one former boston 
police captain two employees of the citys abandoned car division 
two former inspectors at the state registry of motor vehicles a 
special agent with the national auto theft bureau and the owners of 
two city garages 
the defendants face charges ranging from larceny to concealing 
stolen motor vehicles to perjury conspiracy and insurance fraud 
according to the indictments 
kelley and officer william r cantin 40 who was indicted on 535 
charges have been suspended without pay boston police spokesman 
jim jordan said 
two other indicted officers peter doherty 47 and john ulrich 
44 were put on administrative leave guns pending a departmental 
hearing jordan said 
the indictments cap a twoyear investigation by the suffolk 
county district attorneys office with help from the boston police 
anticorruption unit the mdc police and other law enforcement 
agencies officials said 
rodman said one alleged scheme profited from different charges 
levied on cars towed by the boston police and those towed by the 
registry of motor vehicles which charges more to retrieve cars 
rodman said 
he said boston police would tow a car that was parked illegally 
but the defendants would tell the owner the car had been towed by 
the registry 
another scheme rodman said would be to tow a legally parked car 
and wait several weeks after the owner reported it stolen to collect 
daily storage charges often as much as 600 
he said the scheme affected at least 600 people the indictment 
does not say how much money was lost in the alleged schemes

the california supreme court citing the 
need for commercial stability on thursday limited the right of 
wrongfully fired employees to collect big damage awards 
the ruling by the conservativedominated court moved away from 
the course the california judiciary has taken since 1980 when a 
court then controlled by liberals led the nation in restricting an 
employers right to fire at will 
the court ruled 43 that a worker who is fired without good 
cause in violation of a companys express or implied promise can 
sue only for reinstatement and back pay not for emotional distress 
and punitive damages 
initially predictability of the consequences of actions 
related to employment contracts is important to commercial 
stability wrote chief justice malcolm lucas in the majority 
decision 
in order to achieve such stability it is also important that 
employers not be unduly deprived of discretion to dismiss an 
employee by the fear that doing so will give rise to potential tort 
recovery for additional damages in every case the opinion said 
the court allowed employees to seek additional damages when their 
firings involved violations of public policy such as a workers 
refusal to break a law 
justice allen broussard who wrote one of three dissenting 
opinions accused the majority of a radical attempt to rewrite 
california law in a way that will leave wrongfully fired workers 
without adequate relief 
this court is only concerned with stability of the corporation 
and not the slightest bit with stability of everyday working 
people said cliff palefsky a lawyer for employees and labor 
unions 
victor schachter an employers attorney said the ruling 
provides a welcome bridle to unwarranted and costly termination 
claims 
the ruling reinstates but sharply limits a suit by daniel foley 
who was fired from his 56164ayear job as los angeles branch 
manager of interactive data corp in 1983 after telling the company 
that his boss was being investigated by the fbi for embezzlement 
from a former employer 
lucas said foley could sue only on the grounds that his 
encouraging treatment during nearly seven years of employment may 
have amounted to a promise that he wouldnt be fired without good 
cause 
under thursdays ruling his damages would be limited to lost pay 
since the courts 1980 ruling allowing wrongfultermination 
suits more than 40 other states have allowed some types of claims 
by fired workers 
but few have gone as far as california appellate court rulings 
allowing emotional distress and punitive damages for workers 
wrongfully fired 
those rulings were repudiated by the court majority thursday 
most plaintiffs are managerial employees union members generally 
cannot sue but must seek reinstatement through their labor 
contracts 
about 1000 wrongfultermination suits were filed statewide in 
1986 studies have shown employees winning about twothirds of the 
cases that go to trial with damages averaging 177000 for 120 
winning plaintiffs in a 198086 rand corp survey

airline reservations and ticket sales indicate 
travelers have been undeterred by the bombing last week of pan am 
flight 103 the carriers said thursday 
spokesmen for twa british airways and pan am said there has been 
no appreciable change in ticket sales reservations or telephone 
inquiries 
business is normal said margie vodopia a spokeswoman for 
british airways the airline has just come out of what is 
traditionally our busy holiday period and business was normal and we 
are entering what is traditionally a slower time and it has been 
business as usual for that time too 
we have not seen any effect twa spokesman robert blattner 
agreed 
this is of course a quiet period said pan am spokesman jeff 
kriendler and we see no effect on future bookings 
kevin murphy an airline analyst with morgan stanley said that 
while there was no evident change in business during the 
postholiday season he wonders about longrange consequences 
particularly for summer vacationers who are more sensitive to safety 
and economic concerns 
my guess is that summer 89 travel will not be as good as 
summer 88 because of those two factors the weaker dollar and fear 
of terrorism murphy said 
while the fear of terrorism might deter some discretionary 
travelers and cause some business travelers to switch to 
europeanbased airlines murphy said growing fears of poor 
maintenance and old aircraft might have an even bigger impact on the 
airline industry 
in a way it was good news that it was a bomb and not metal 
fatigue because if it was metal fatigue people really wouldnt 
trust the rest of the fleet murphy said 
travel agents say some flyers have voiced concerns about aging 
jetliners but not enough to cause cancellations 
i was booking someone today on eastern to lima peru and their 
only question was how old is the airplane but they still 
booked iris carroll vice president of adventure travel in 
pompano beach fla said thursday 
sophisticated clients know these things happen and that they 
have no control over it said jack bloch president of jbs world 
travel in new york if they were afraid they couldnt travel 
its the infrequent leisure flyer who is most susceptible to 
postcrash jitters bloch said 
its an immediate reaction but if nothing happens in the next 
month or two theyll forget about it which they always do he

yugoslavia may have to declare a 
moratorium on foreign debt payments after parliament refused to pass 
a law the imf demanded for continued financial support a newspaper 
said thursday 
the major yugoslav communist party daily borba quoted an 
unidentified cabinet minister as saying the government should resign 
as a result 
it said parliament on wednesday voted against a government 
austerity law to limit wages in hardpressed public services such as 
health and education 
deputies defied warnings from premier branko mikulic of 
yugoslavias obligations to the international monetary fund the 
newspaper said 
mikulic reportedly said the imf insisted on the law before 
agreeing in june to grant yugoslavia a oneyear standby credit of 
416 million 
about 260 million of that credit already has been used 
according to official statistics 
parliaments decision destroys the standby arrangement with the 
imf which in turn carries a series of other consequences borba 
quoted the cabinet minister as saying after this the government 
if it is intelligent enough should submit its resignation it 
quoted the minister as saying 
the mikulic government faces widespread public calls to resign or 
be swiftly replaced because of its inability to resolve yugoslavias 
economic and social crisis 
it is standard practice for the imf to insist on curbing public 
spending in inflationridden countries to reduce the rate of price 
increases 
with unemployment at 15 percent and inflation around 250 percent 
the standby loan was designed to help yugoslavia meet payments on 
its 21 billion foreign debt and reach agreements on loan 
rescheduling with western creditors 
western commercial banks and governments usually follow the imfs 
lead in judging whether to continue supporting a debtor country 
the cabinet minister was quoted as saying parliaments decision 
could endanger the rescheduling of 16 billion of yugoslavias 
foreign debt falling due next year which had been agreed 
tentatively with foreign creditors 
if that should happen according to preliminary estimates the 
gross national product would decrease next year by eight percent 
thus presenting us with the possibility of declaring a moratorium 
the cabinet minister reportedly said 
borba said the cabinet convened an emergency session immediately 
after the vote late wednesday to discuss the resulting 
situation the closed meeting published no statement by thursday 
meanwhile thousands of workers in different parts of the country 
were reported on strike thursday protesting low wages and living 
standards that officially have dropped to mid1960s levels

presidentelect bush expressing horror 
that a us jetliner was downed by a bomb said thursday he would 
seek hard and punish firmly those responsible if they can be 
found 
but bush said it would be imprudent for him or any other 
official to discuss what kind of action can be taken to 
retaliate against terrorists 
bush who has been secluded at a 10000acre south texas ranch 
hunting quail for three days said he had no other information than 
what was in the public domain about the bomb that blew up a pan 
american jetliner over scotland last week the crash killed 259 
passengers and crew members and 11 people on the ground 
the vice president made his comments as he left chase naval air 
station in beeville texas headed for pintala about 15 miles from 
montgomery 
bush spent a few hours here fishing for bass on a private 55acre 
lake owned by ray scott head of the bass anglers sportsman society 
and founder of bassmasters 
ohoh real trouble the presidentelect said as he 
snagged a tree by mistake but casting from the back of a boat he 
caught a twopound fish a few minutes later 
bush caught nine fish by the end of the day the largest of which 
weighed three pounds and he threw them all back said bushs 
spokesman steve hart 
the presidentelect arrived back to washington in the evening 
asked about the british investigators conclusion that a bomb 
destroyed the pan am jumbo jet bush said he felt horror at the 
finding 
pressed by reporters on what action should be taken he 
responded seek hard and punish firmly decisively those who did 
this if you can ever find them he added when i say punish 
severely thats what i mean 
despite his tough rhetoric bush acknowledged that stopping 
terrorism was virtually impossible 
when youre dealing with something as cowardly as that its 
almost impossible to guarantee there will never be another terrorism 
act he said unfortunately weve seen that happen several 
times 
to stop terrorist acts officials need to continue and step up 
antiterrorism policies including improved intelligence and 
heightened worldwide awareness to the problem bush said 
as vice president bush headed a presidential task force on 
terrorism and he referred to that role thursday 
we have a fine antiterrorism policy he said i take great 
pride in having coordinated the antiterrorism report and 
setting high standards for people around the world he said 
at chase naval air station bush took a few minutes to mount a 
restored tbm avenger a torpedo bomber like the one he flew on world 
war ii missions over the pacific 
clutching a white marking pen he signed and underlined his 
wifes name barbara just below the cockpit he then wrote 
george bush 
all of bushs planes during were named for the vice presidents 
thenfiancee barbara pierce the plane will be transported to the 
corpus christi texas naval air station for display 
attending the ceremony was leo nadeau of san diego bushs 
regular tail gunner on bombing missions nadeaus name and that of 
his wife ginny also were written on the plane 
bush said his annual hunting trip was enjoyable particularly the 
exercise from walking the shooting wasnt up to past years though 
the drought i think caught up with the quail this year the 
hunting party shot about 10 birds a day instead of the usual 30 to 
40 he said 
while bush enjoys most outdoor sports he said fishing is his 
favorite 
in fact hart said the vice president planned another twoday 
fishing trip to florida before the jan 20 inauguration possibly 
over the martin luther king birthday holiday 
the next trip will be to islamorada in the florida keys about 75 
miles south of miami 
during this stay at the lazy f ranch bush said he and his fellow 
hunter and nominee for secretary of state james baker iii 
discussed some personnel matter as well as policies after bush 
is sworn in 
in washington bush said he will finish the cabinet start 
fleshing out the deputy secretary and undersecretary levels and 
most important formulating definitive plans for the first 100 
days 
he said he is fairly close to naming an energy secretary and 
a drug czar the two cabinetlevel posts that remain vacant 
bush said he didnt know if he would make any personnel 
announcements friday but his aides indicated that was a possibility

a man with 10 drunken driving convictions 
who lost his license for the offense in 1983 had his bail set at 
250000 thursday in a new drunken driving case 
the bail for william raymond hilbert 43 of pomona was raised 
from 15000 at the request of a deputy of los angeles county 
district attorney ira reiner who called the defendant a hazard to 
the community 
this is a blatant example of the kind of driver we must keep 
off the roads and freeways especially over the holiday weekend for 
the safety of other drivers reiner said 
municipal court commissioner richard grey ordered hilbert jailed 
when he couldnt post the bond on new misdemeanor charges 
hilbert was arrested oct 2 after a breath test showed his blood 
alcohol level was 27 percent nearly triple the legal maximum of 
10 percent said al albergate the district attorneys spokesman 
he is charged with drunken driving and with driving on a revoked 
license 
since 1981 he has been convicted 10 times of drunken driving 
and has been sentenced twice to the maximum oneyear term albergate 
said his license was revoked in 1983 on one such conviction the 
spokesman said adding that he didnt know how much time hilbert has

a federal judge agreed thursday to hear arguments in 
a lastditch lawsuit seeking to stop the closing of the miami news 
but the 93yearold dailys publisher still planned to stop the 
presses saturday 
us district judge stanley marcus scheduled a hearing friday 
afternoon on a lawsuit by community newspapers readers and news 
distributors contending that closing the news would violate 
antitrust laws 
the lawsuit is based on the joint operating agreement between the 
news owner atlantabased cox enterprises inc and the miami 
heralds owner knightridder inc 
under the planned shutdown knightridder would continue to pay a 
share of profits to cox the plaintiffs said 
it is incredible what theyve done which is to pay a 
competitor not to operate said jeffrey m herman one of the 
lawyers representing the plaintiffs its the same as gm paying 
ford not to build cars 
a chicago newspaper consultant representing a group negotiating 
to buy the news said he was still working on a deal with cox its 
close said john malone we are proceeding ahead with what cox 
wants 
cox newspapers president james easterly however said malone had 
failed to come up with money cox required to keep the paper open 
pending the sale 
easterly said if the malone deal falls through he has no other 
offers and will shut the paper down saturday as scheduled 
the antitrust lawsuit filed wednesday lists as plaintiffs florida 
publications inc which publishes more than a dozen community 
newspapers in dade two miami news readers and six independent news 
distributors 
the lawsuit asks for an injunction barring cox and knightridder 
from shutting down the news or selling it without profitsharing 
rights under the joint operating agreement easterly said cox will 
contest the lawsuit 
knightridder spokeswoman lee ann schlatter said thursday that 
her company feels the lawsuit had no merit and incorrectly implies 
that knightridder was involved in the decision to shut down the 
news 
the complaint which seeks in excess of 500 million in punitive 
damages alleges that cox and knightridder conspired to 
monopolize the market for daily newspapers in miami and that the 
plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury if the news closes 
the lawsuit contends the deal triggering the closing of the news 
conflicts with the newspaper preservation act which congress passed 
in 1970 to save failing newspapers and competing editorial voices by 
allowing the opposing papers to combine their business operations 
us justice department officials already are independently 
investigating the planned shutdown or sale of the news for possible 
antitrust law violations federal officials have refused to discuss 
the status of their probe

higher gasoline tax and 83 percent a higher tax on alcohol and 
tobacco

two federal courts cleared way thursday for 
the setting of a statewide date for election of trial judges 
delayed for years by lawsuits charging racial discrimination 
state attorney general mike moore said the court action would end 
the piecemeal fashion in which mississippi voters elect chancery 
and circuit judges by allowing one general election on june 20 in 
which blacks would have a fair chance of being elected 
now i dont think mississippi is discriminatory and i think it 
is time we stood up and showed it moore said 
no black has been elected a judge in mississippi without first 
being appointed as a result blacks challenged judicial election 
practices in lawsuits filed in 1984 and 1985 and some judges whose 
terms expired have remained in office awaiting court action on an 
election date 
the action thursday involved the signing of final drafts of 
proposed orders in two separate courts officials said 
carroll rhodes a lawyer in hazlehurst who represents black 
plaintiffs in the fouryearold lawsuit said an agreement had been 
reach to allow federal courts in both mississippi and washington to 
move quickly to close out all pending cases and appeals dealing with 
the election of chancery and circuit judges 
under the agreement primary elections will be held statewide 
april 4 for the judgeships with the general election on june 20 
rhodes said earlier elections in about half the districts had been 
scheduled in february and april 
us district judge william h barbour jr signed an order 
delaying until june elections that would have been held in february 
in 21 districts that have not voted for judges since 1982 
under a settlement of a racial bias lawsuit already worked out by 
barbour 13 blacks had filed in those districts before a dec 9 
deadline attorneys said under the agreement filing would not be 
reopened in the 21 districts 
the other court that signed an order thursday was a panel of 
three federal judges meeting in jackson and led by the chief judge 
of the 5th us circuit court of appeals it tentatively accepted 
settlement of a similar redistricting lawsuit in which election of 
judges postbypost instead of districtwide was challenged as 
designed to dilute the voting strength of blacks 
the plan calls for redrawing 19 eastern districts to allow 
multijudge elections with a feb 28 qualifying deadline rhodes 
said he said that with all candidates running in one districtwide 
election blacks could concentrate their voting strength on one 
candidate a technique called singleshot voting that has helped 
minorities elsewhere 
the state attorney generals office said the qualifying deadline 
for the 19 districts would be scheduled to allow the legislature 
time to adopt the redistricting which must be approved first by the 
us justice department under the 1965 voting rights act 
moore said he expected rapid approval because federal 
representatives participated in negotiations in which the state 
pushed for the costsaving uniform election date and gave in on 
opposing the multijudge redistricts 
this is something new for mississippi and i think it shows 
there is progressive leadership in the state said rhodes i 
just hope this progressive leadership will continue and this will 
not be the end of it

withdrawal of approximately 50000 cuban troops the state news 
agency angop reported 
a report monitored in lisbon said dos santos sent a letter to 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar requesting 
international aid for the 800 million the luanda government says it 
will cost to send the cubans home 
the troops have supported marxist angola in its 13year civil war 
against us and south africanbacked rebels they are being 
withdrawn as part of a peace plan for southern africa 
angola cuba and south africa signed pacts dec 22 that foresee 
the gradual pullout of the cubans and implementation of an 
independence plan for neighboring southwest africa better known as 
namibia which south africa has ruled for 73 years 
because of the economic difficulties faced by angola and cuba 
their economies cannot bear the costs alone angop quoted dos 
santos as saying 
in lisbon rebels of the national union for the total 
independence of angola unita said they planted a bomb that 
exploded tuesday in downtown luanda killing one person and injuring 
13 
angola on thursday accused the rebels of killing 31 civilians and 
kidnapping 92 in terrorist attacks over an unspecified period angop 
reported 
it said troops killed 69 rebels and captured six in clashes 
across angola during the last week with 11 soldiers killed 33 
wounded and two missing 
soldiers also freed 129 civilians from rebel captivity the 
report said 
no independent confirmation was available 
in south africa foreign affairs minister roelof botha said peace 
in neighboring mozambique would mean more to his countrys 
international position than ending hostilities in angola and namibia 
this would strengthen south africas role as a regional power 
botha said in an interview broadcast on state radio 
for years mozambican officials have accused the pretoria 
government of supporting rightist mozambican national resistance 
guerrillas in their fight to topple the marxistoriented maputo 
government 
relations between the two countries improved this year with 
mozambican president joaquim chissano playing host to south african 
president pw botha at a summit in september mozambican officials 
still refer to elements in south africa however who they charge

a group of cuban intellectuals on thursday sharply 
criticized a proposal by more than 100 writers artists and 
scientists living abroad that president fidel castro hold a 
referendum on extending his rule 
roberto retamar a longtime supporter of castro who heads a 
cultural center in this city said the appeal was tainted because it 
likened cubas situation to that of chile in chile military 
president augusto pinochet was defeated last october in a yesorno 
vote on extending his 15year rule 
speaking at a news conference with four other intellectuals 
retamar rejected the comparison and called pinochet an assassin 
a foreign ministry spokesman made a similar criticism earlier 
this week when he was quoted as rejecting the proposal 
retamar said many who signed the open letter asking for a 
referendum would applaud the establishment of a fascist regime in 
the entire world 
abriel prito an essayist at the news conference said such a 
plebiscite is unnecessary because few societies have undergone a 
period of selfexamination as profound as cuba has over the past two 
years he said cuba has carried out perhaps the purest revolution 
in history 
those who signed the open letter to castro asking for the 
referendum come from the united states europe and latin america 
the appeal was also signed by about 50 cubans exiles 
the letter was made public earlier this week as castro prepares 
to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the cuban revolution on sunday

a federal judge questioned jurors thursday to 
determine if a 815 million damage award against the gd searle amp 
co drug firm should be overturned because of possible jury 
misconduct 
esther kociemba of elk river won the award in september after a 
threemonth trial and almost 10 days of jury deliberations the 
verdict supported her claim that a searle copper7 intrauterine 
birth control device had triggered a pelvic infection that left her 
infertile 
but three of the eight jurors later signed affidavits alleging 
they were the victims of verbal harassment and intimidation and had 
been bullied into an unjust verdict 
the affidavits also said newspaper accounts of the trial had been 
smuggled into the jury room along with information from a medical 
dictionary us district judge robert renner had specifically told 
the jurors not to discuss the case read about it or consult medical 
dictionaries 
renner questioned the jurors one at a time he did not say when 
he would issue a ruling under federal law the hearing could not 
delve into the process of deliberations including the allegations 
of intimidation but only into evidence of improper outside 
influence 
in an interview following the hearing searle attorney paul 
strain said the jurors testimony definitely points to misconduct 
the record of misconduct is even more extensive than we 
thought including one juror discussing the case with a relative 
who is a doctor strain said 
what is striking is the tremendous degree of use of extraneous 
prejudicial information he said it clearly infected the entire 
deliberative process 
kociembas attorney michael ciresi said there is no basis to 
searles motion to impeach the verdict ciresi and other lawyers for 
kociemba had complained in a previous open hearing that searle 
refuses to accept its defeat and is trying to retry the case outside 
the court room 
i didnt believe there was any basis for the motion before the 
hearing and i dont believe anything happened during the hearing to 
change that opinion ciresi said thursday indeed what took 
place during the hearing supported the plaintiffs kociembas 
position 
the kociemba verdict was the first time punitive damages had been 
awarded against chicagobased searle over the copper7 and ciresi 
said the verdict was a victory not only for kociemba but for the 
more than 500 women who have suits pending against searle over the

seven of 115 complaints of police misconduct 
stemming from a riot at a park on a hot august night have been 
forwarded for departmental trial a civilian review board said 
thursday 
the civilian complaint review board said it has taken up 22 of 
the 115 complaints and has recommended to police commissioner 
benjamin ward that departmental trials be held for six officers on 
seven allegations of brutality 
at least 52 officers and 18 civilians required hospital treatment 
for injuries received during the aug 7 riot at tompkins square 
park a police chief accused of poor supervision resigned and two 
policemen were indicted this month on assault charges 
most of the complaints not forwarded to the commissioner were 
dropped for lack of substantiation with complainants failing to 
follow up their allegations the board said in an interim report 
everyones going to be disappointed about this investigation 
said thomas reppetto the head of the citizens crime commission a 
nonprofit group that monitors crime in new york city 
civilian complaint review boards around the country tend to be 
very legalistic thats the way they have to be reppetto added 
that has a tendency to disappoint people who thought a civilian 
review board was going to work a miracle 
the report expressed frustration that no police officers had 
volunteered evidence 
here youve got over 100 complaints in the presence of 400 
police officers and 40 sergeants over a period of about six hours in 
about a sixblock area and no police officer has come forward to 
either defend one of his fellow officers or to provide evidence that 
one of these things happened board member dan johnston said at a 
news conference 
johnston accused the policemans benevolent association of 
recommending officers not cooperate which police union president 
phil caruso denied 
chairwoman mary burke nicholas said the board would hear 27 more 
complaints on jan 18 and should resolve the rest by february 
she said at the news conference that of the 15 cases closed 
without disciplinary charges eight were dropped because 
complainants or victims were uncooperative or unavailable three 
other complaints were withdrawn two were found to be outside the 
boards jurisdiction one was unsubstantiated and one was closed 
because the officer could not be identified the report said 
in my judgment were going to end up with a large number of 
cases where we believe the abuse occurred and where we cant 
identify the officer said johnston 
videotapes taken by residents showed that several officers 
covered their badges with dark tape to keep from being identified 
the melee between police and demonstrators was sparked by 
enforcement of a curfew in tompkins square park 
the park in a lower east side neighborhood called the east 
village is a gathering place for musicians drug dealers homeless 
people and teenagers its neighbors range from squatters to owners 
of luxury condominiums the latter group favoring the curfew

while xray machines are severely limited in

developed a device that can detect bombs inside luggage with uncanny 
regularity 
but no airline has ordered one of the devices and with the 
exception of two prototype machines used in a yearlong test program 
in san francisco and los angeles no airports have put the machine 
into operation 
the disclosure wednesday that a bomb detonated aboard a pan am 
jumbo jet last week over scotland killing all 259 people aboard is 
likely to spur interest in the new explosives detection device 
industry officials said 
the machine goes by the name of termal neutron analysis device 
or tna and is about twice the size of an airport xray machine 
during the yearlong test under a contract from the federal aviation 
administration it demonstrated a 95 percent detection rate with few 
false alarms the agency said

suggestion all the blame for the economic 
illiteracy so widespread in the american populace should not fall 
on the nations schools 
it is not just in the classroom that economics is shrouded in 
ignorance mystery and superstitution but also in politics and 
government in the workplace and in the shopping mall and just 
about everywhere else you care to look 
for example when congressmen discuss the state of the economy 
with officials of the federal reserve board emotion and political 
prejudices often overshadow the whole debate 
legislators are wont to charge that the fed is heedlessly hurting 
their constituents by setting interest rates too high 
a fed official counters by declaring that the fed doesnt set 
interest rates market forces do and interest rates would be a lot 
lower if only congress stopped voting for inflationary spending 
programs and balanced its budget for a change 
ordinary citizens may not have been given much schooling on the 
factors that determine interest rates or on the workings of the fed 
but they may quickly come to the conclusion that both sides in 
this argument are engaged in some selfserving posturing 
the results of an economics test given to more than 8000 high 
school students made a lot of headlines when they were made public 
the other day 
fewer than half of the students it was reported showed a grasp 
of such basic economic concepts as inflation and the gross national 
product our schools are producing a nation of economic 
illiterates said one of the studys authors 
some of the sample questions from the test were not as simple as 
they looked though if you consider the emotional baggage that 
comes with so many basic economic terms 
one multiplechoice item for instance called for a definition 
of profits by the time they reach high school how many 
americans have not heard that word used as a pejorative 
would the question have read the same if the testtakers were 
asked to define earnings of a business or net income 
if economic ignorance begins in the schools a case can certainly 
be made that it is perpetuated by the pillars of capitalism as it is 
practiced in this country 
the bank that gives away free toaster ovens to new depositors 
rather than promoting competitive interest rates is doing nothing to 
further the cause of enlightenment 
and the greed is good school of financiers on wall street 
hardly proved their case when several of them went to prison 
many honest business people also reinforce ignorance and 
suspicion about the free enterprise system by talking in euphemisms 
and defensive generalities about what they do at work 
consider the stock market of what social benefit is this 
institution prone as it is to menacing the rest of the economy with 
wild and unpredictable swings 
when this question is put to wall street leaders they typically 
invoke phrases like corporate democracy and capital 
formation 
nobody seems comfortable enough to acknowledge that the market is 
a machine driven by individuals hunger for wealth designed to 
harness the vast amount of energy created by that hunger and to put 
it to as much general social benefit as possible 
whether it serves that function as well as it might of course 
is a separate question if it is worthy of its place in the system 
it could certainly stand up to the scrutiny of a wellinformed 
society of economic literates 
it might even benefit from that scrutiny by gaining a little 
respect

the jury is still out on ronald reagan but 
history is likely to regard him as an average to good president 
according to some scholars of the presidency 
with little time left in reagans final term the associated 
press interviewed eight presidential scholars including specialists 
in history political science and social psychology 
their tentative verdict reagan will get high marks for his use 
of the white house pulpit to unite the country and will get credit 
for improving eastwest relations even though soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev may have been more responsible for it than he 
my view is that he will be viewed by the american people as an 
aboveaverage president said thomas cronin a historian of the 
presidency at colorado college who calls himself a moderate 
democrat i think the historians and biographers will treat him a 
little bit more harshly still ranking him at least an average 
president but not as high as the american people now do or will 
but daniel franklin a professor of political science at colgate 
university who is critical of many reagan policies said i think 
in the historical sense somewhere down the road that reagan will 
be considered as a somewhat worse than average president because of 
the problems that he has left us 
if the economy turns sour in the wake of his administrations 
record budget and trade deficits reagan may go down in history like 
calvin coolidge as a president who failed to take action to stave 
off coming disaster 
some scholars said reagans reputation will also suffer from 
scandals in his administration and from his failure to deal 
effectively with such social ills as the plight of the homeless 
i think probably in the short range reaction in the next five 
or 10 years even liberal and radical historians will find something 
good to say about him and that will be that he somehow represented a 
kind of quality of americanism and a sense of national unity and he 
projected that from the white house said herman belz a 
neoconservative historian at the university of maryland 
whether or not in the long run our relations with the soviets 
will be so good that people will always say it started in the fall 
of 1988 under ronald reagan i dont know but it would certainly 
look that way said vaughn davis bornet professor emeritus of 
history at southern oregon state college and a selfdescribed 
moderate republican 
edward w chester a conservative historian at the university of 
texas said it is too early to evaluate reagan but echoing many of 
his academic colleagues he said the deficit does bother me the 
deficit does bother me 
i think we can say history will probably look most kindly upon 
him not necessarily for any substantive policy changes that he 
brought about but for the tone that he brought to the office and for 
a renewed sense of national pride said charles w dunn a former 
republican congressional aide who teaches political science at 
clemson university and has written widely on the presidency 
austin ranney chairman of the department of political science at 
the university of california at berkeley said on just the 
externalities of it i think reagans presidency with one huge 
if will probably go down as one of the most successful ones 
certainly in this century and maybe ever 
however comparing reagan with one of the predecessors the 
president most admires ranney also said that reagan may go down 
in history pretty much the way coolidge did if some economists 
predictions of economic collapse come true 
coolidge is not seen now as a successful president followed by 
hoover a bum but as a president whose donothing policies led to 
the huge crash of the early 30s that hoover was the victim of he 
said 
dean keith simonton a professor of psychology at the university 
of california at davis who has devised a formula for predicting how 
history will rate presidents said when you put all the pros and 
all the cons in the equation ronald reagan comes out as a slightly 
above average president 
one of the pro factors for reagan said simonton is the 
improvement in ussoviet relations that he and gorbachev have 
forged 
he gets nice points for that in foreign policy when actually he 
didnt take the initiative for that simonton said 
in all fairness gorbachev deserves more credit than he does 
said colorado colleges cronin 
still said southern oregons bornet ronald reagan stepped 
forward as usual and managed to pin it on himself and thats going 
to be hard to erase ill tell you 
clemsons dunn similarly argued a good leader also must 
seize the opportunity and gorbachev offered an opportunity to play 
for high stakes in the international arena he seized that he was 
not frozen in place by rigid ideology and thus i think one has to 
give him credit 
from berkeley ranny said the relaxation of eastwest tensions 
was the most important of reagans accomplishments in foreign policy 
now you might say thats because he got lucky and had gorbachev 
there and i wouldnt quarrel with that he said nevertheless 
it did happen and i think when historians look back at that they 
will say that he was in terms of foreign policy one of the most 
successful postwar presidents that we have had 
psychologist simonton said one big factor working in reagans 
favor is the simple fact that he was the first president since 
dwight eisenhower to serve eight years 
the longer you serve the more events happen that can be 
credited to you whether or not you are responsible for them he 
said you make a thick chapter in the history of america under 
your name 
although reagan recently pictured himself as the adversary of a 
washington colony protecting special interests at the expense of 
ordinary citizens some scholars argued that one of his own chief 
shortcomings is his failure to be an advocate for those on the 
outside

there will be a feeling that he was largely indifferent to 
those without voice in washington that he responded much more to 
upper middle class and middle class america said cronin the 
presidency ought to be a place which raises its voice on behalf of 
those who dont have the powerful lobbies 
cronin is selfdescribed as a democrat with a liberal viewpoint 
compared with reagans but the more conservative chester agreed 
i also think reagan could perhaps have done more for the 
homeless 
the irancontra affair and the investigations and indictments 
that have marked reagans administration also will cast their 
shadow the scholars said 
the people will forget that quickly the historians wont 
said cronin the historians will have chapters on the sleaze stuff 
and theyll call it as bad or equal to the watergate mess 
some who praised reagan highly on other grounds conceded he was 
not as attentive as he should have been to his duties 
he didnt keep his ear to the ground enough and he didnt have 
enough interest in political life the warp and woof of it to do as 
good a job as he could have said the neoconservative belz 
in strikingly similar language ranny said i imagine he loses 
a few points because of the large number of scandals and indictments 
and things like that and simonton said that he is probably 
going to get some negative points because of such troubles 
in comparing reagan with past presidents scholars cited the 
names ranging from eisenhower to lyndon johnson 
personality and character issues for 20 years have overwhelmed 
evaluation of lyndon johnson as president and if thats any 
precedent then maybe for several decades it will be difficult to 
get down to serious business with ronald reagan said bornet who 
has written extensively on johnson 
johnson he said is still the crude cornpone president and 
reagan is going to continue to be for a long time this image people 
watched on tv and this person the press correctly portrayed as 
essentially a lazy president 
as for eisenhower he has undergone a reevaluation in recent 
years with scholars believing him a much more activist president 
than first believed ranney said if future scholarship finds out 
that behind the scenes and when the truth is known reagan himself 
was also a much more handson active president than we now believe 
and incidentally it is unlikely that they will find that he might 
undergo the same kind of upgrading 
dunn however said definitely a comparison of eisenhower and 
reagan is in order eisenhower had a very subtle style of leadership 
that evidently caused him to lead more effectively than most people 
thought he was leading reagans leadership i dont think will come 
off as that kind of subtle hidden hand leadership so much as it has 
been leadership through orchestration of symbols and movement of the 
public mind 
on the other hand the clemson political scientist said reagan 
may also be in for the kind of scaling down of his reputation that 
john f kennedy has suffered as the force of his personality recedes 
there is no longer the camelot mystique to kennedy a lot of 
that has worn off he said i suspect that with ronald reagan 
there will be a little bit of wearing off of the mystique that 
surrounds him

john sullivans lawless young life was 
already careening out of control by the time the 12yearold struck 
and killed two people with a stolen car while trying to outrun the 
cops 
i knew sooner or later there was going to be an accident 
said pauline payne the 72yearold greatgrandmother who raised the 
boy from infancy after his unwed parents abandoned him i knew he 
was going to do the wrong thing 
now she said theres nothing i can say but cry 
john l sullivan iii a wisp his family called johnny boy 
admitted responsibility for the oct 24 deaths of a father of nine 
children and an 11yearold girl hes now serving four years at a 
maximum security lockup for juveniles in rural northeastern 
pennsylvania 
he was a streetsavvy career criminal before age 10 when his 
first arrest was recorded for stealing 327 from under his 
greatgrandmothers pillow his family said he was stealing bicycles 
years before that 
his rap sheet includes 13 arrests five for stealing cars in the 
last two years he escaped five times from minimumsecurity juvenile 
homes committing more crimes every time he hit the streets 
johnny boy who turned 13 on dec 12 was on the loose at the 
time of his fatal joyride although he was supposed to be under 
watch awaiting placement in a secure state lockup that was too 
crowded to take him right away 
how could a boy so young get into so much trouble why didnt 
anybody stop him 
a litany of failure offers clues a broken home a guardian too 
old to keep up with johnny boy lack of resources in a social 
services system that should have intervened before things got out of 
control and an overcrowded juvenile justice system illequipped for 
criminals so young 
we normally dont get kids that young in that kind of 
trouble said mingo stroeber an attorney with the defender 
association of philadelphia which handled the case 
there are very few programs equipped to deal with kids that 
young nobody seemed to know what to do with him miss stroeber 
said these kids are victims his family failed him the dependent 
child system failed him the juvenile court system failed him we as 
a society failed 
others labeled him incorrigible 
there are bad seeds ive never seen one like this he had no 
appreciation for western values said family court judge frank 
reynolds 
johnny boy exudes a peculiar combination of streetsmart 
toughness and moppet charm prosecutors consider him a corrupt 
manchild who manipulates people to get his way his lawyers thought 
him lovable enough to adopt 
he caused a crash that killed two people then asked for crayons 
and a coloring book in jail 
he bought flowers and cards for his greatgrandmother on mothers 
day then swiped her cash as she slept 
he could steal a car in seconds but because he stands just 5 
feet tall and weighs 100 pounds he had to sit on umbrellas jackets 
and other makeshift booster seats to help him see over the steering 
wheel 
today when most boys his age are in junior high school john 
sullivan is living behind 12foothigh chainlink fences topped with 
barbed wire at the north central treatment facility in danville pa 
johnny boys lifetime of trouble began just months after he was 
born he was given to his paternal greatgrandmother by a mother who 
didnt want him and a father who is a confessed murderer 
pauline payne raised him as best she could in the nasty north 
philadelphia neighborhood 
his father john sullivan jr 32 pleaded guilty in october to 
thirddegree murder for stabbing his girlfriend who he said had 
been unfaithful sullivan was also charged with attempted murder in 
1977 and with robbery conspiracy and drunken driving in 1982 
no one knows what happened to his mother lena daniels she is 
believed dead possibly murdered and may have spent time in a north 
carolina prison according to fragments gleaned from 12 interviews 
with acquaintances and authorities johnny boy who wasnt made 
available for an interview didnt know her at all 
his mother was wild said mrs payne neither one mother 
or father was going to take care of him 
mrs payne has lived in a nursing home since may when she broke 
her leg in a fall in an interview a reporters mention of johnny 
boy made her shiver 
his legs are longer than mine and younger too she said i 
couldnt keep up with him there are lots of things you cant do 
when you get up in age i knowed he was going to get into trouble 
the first hint came when he was 7 ghetto gangs appeared outside 
his greatgrandmothers rowhouse at night and whistled for him to 
come out and romp 
he got with the bad crowd started stealing bikes stealing 
cars and driving cars said mrs payne he wasnt a bad little 
boy he just got in with them older boys 
she said she tried to keep johnny boy out of trouble and gave him 
love hed come and look at me with them pitiful eyes and ask for 
a dollar id give that little boy my heart he knowed i was 
softhearted 
but there was no one else to head off trouble 
this kid had a poor hand dealt to him he was not given the 
tools to make it said gerald stanshine an attorney with the 
defender association 
hes been on the streets more or less raising himself added 
harvey crudup executive director of a juvenile detention center 
the reason it came to everybodys attention is that he killed two 
people he probably could have gone on stealing cars for years 
johnny boys first arrest was july 16 1986 for stealing 327 
from his greatgrandmother mrs payne turned him in but later 
dropped the charges 
before that month was out he was arrested three times for 
robbery and once for arson 
last spring he was arrested for theft and for unauthorized use 
of an auto more charges of car theft and running away followed in 
june 
on july 5 he was sentenced to a state lockup at loysville and 
given a transfer date of sept 6 because no space was immediately 
available johnny boy was placed in a juvenile home that was no 
match for him 
three times he fled and was rearrested each time he was 
charged with theft receiving stolen property and unauthorized use 
of an auto 
to hold him authorities wanted to put him in the youth study 
center the citys only maximumsecurity lockup for juveniles but 
the 105bed facility was 57 kids over its limit and under a 1987 
court order the city agreed not to take anyone younger than 13 
the courts sent him back to a home that had locks on the doors 
and windows but no bars 
i couldnt hold him because its against the law said 
reynolds the family court judge it broke my heart

there were red lights flashing here we knew if john sullivan 
hit the streets john sullivan would commit a crime probably with a 
car we knew it but we were powerless to hold him reynolds said 
district attorney ronald castille derisively called the homes 
escape shelters because 40 to 50 juveniles run away from them 
each month his office has asked the city for 100 additional 
maximumsecurity spaces for hardcore offenders 
we just dont have enough space its not easy to explain to 
the families of the victims you have to defend a system you know 
stinks said al toczydlowski deputy district attorney in charge 
of the juvenile division 
johnny boy created his own diversion to slip out of the juvenile 
justice center on oct 8 while other boys staged a fight he stole 
a set of keys from a guard 
two weeks later he and two chums aged 13 and 14 prowled a 
parking lot looking for a car they opted for a gray 1986 
oldsmobile ciera smashing a back window to get in 
using a screw driver with expert precision johnny boy pried off 
the ignition lock on the steering column and hotwired the starter 
police spotted the joy riders running a red light and gave chase 
in a cruiser equipped with flashing dome lights but no siren 
with the cops on his tail blowing their horn and flashing their 
high beams sullivan ran four stop signs and another red light 
it was 530 pm rush hour 
i didnt want to get caught the boy told police i just 
floored it and took off i was doing about 60 miles an hour 
the oldsmobile rammed a 1986 chrysler lebaron driven by william 
oconnor a 53yearold real estate agent on his way home from work 
oconnors first wife had died of cancer in 1976 and he later 
married her sister between them they had nine children 
the chrysler careened into tyesha tate 11 a sixthgrader 
walking to the grocery store with her sister robin 7 they were a 
block from home 
tyesha who sang in the choir of the second baptist church of 
nicetown died at a hospital her sister who suffered critical head 
injuries was released dec 5 
the pursuit probably lasted 30 seconds said officer william 
rhodes who chased sullivan in the cruiser i said to my partner 
hes going to crash that car we were really upset when we found 
out other people had been hit 
johnny boy suffered scratches on his arms and face in handcuffs 
he was shown the tate girls body 
he wasnt upset he wasnt anything the only thing he said 
was oh no said rhodes 
johnny boy was charged with homicide by vehicle involuntary 
manslaughter aggravated assault auto theft unlawful use of an 
auto and conspiracy 
because he is a juvenile he was tried under the single charge of 
delinquency in pennsylvania no one under 14 can be tried as an 
adult unless the charge is murder 
theres more than enough blame to spread around said richard 
schwartz executive director of the juvenile law center an advocacy 
group 
the solution is to build another major lockup for several 
million dollars we dont have or plan for a program to deal with the 
problem up front when juveniles first get into trouble schwartz 
said 
it makes more sense to spend money to build a barn that works 
rather than spend money on locks for a door thats already open you 
cant do patchwork repairs on a juvenile justice system

from the days when inventor thomas 
edisons light bulb first lit the nights of 1879 americans have 
been regarded as naturally inventive and creative 
much of that innovation derives from the work of scientists and 
engineers at general electrics research and development center 
which traces its roots to the edison electrical light company formed 
in 1878 to support the experiments of thomas edison 
ge scientists brainstormed the magnetic resonance imager which 
uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of internal 
organs without xrays 
real diamonds were concocted in one of their laboratories not 
pulled from the depths of the earth 
in 1979 ge was the first company to pass the 50000th patent 
mark 
but ges and americas technological lead is being threatened 
by the japanese who up until now have had a reputation as clever 
copycats 
since the end of world war ii the japanese have borrowed 
american inventions improved them and turned them into inexpensive 
household staples color television sets transistor radios and 
videocassettee recorders were all original american ideas the 
japanese have capitalized on 
all that is changing 
the japanese are no longer content to pick the brains of american 
scientists and engineers for new technology says roland w schmitt 
president of rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy and former 
vice president of corporate research and development at ge 
the japanese are trying to be innovators schmitt says 
their aggressive patenting efforts prove that japan now acquires 
more patents worldwide than any other country 
schmitt says the united states still leads the way in developing 
new technology but japan is now in a stage where theyre starting 
to do this he said 
japanese business executives say its only natural for their 
companies to develop their own technology 
any company that hopes to continue making progress will require 
innovation be it through its own or transferred technology said 
kazuya hosaka manager of hitachi ltds patent office in tokyo 
many in this country question whether the japanese can be 
pioneering 
the japanese acquire hundreds of patents each year theyre quick 
at turning inventions into products and their students study science 
and technology in an education system considered superior in those 
areas 
but theyre strangled by a culture that frowns upon risktaking 
and prizes collective action over individual effort their 
scientists and engineers arent trained to be pioneering 
americans meanwhile are encouraged to be creative 
we educate our scientists to be pioneers schmitt said 
a recent study for the national science foundation showed that in 
1987 three japanese companies garnered the most us patents 
hitachi with 873 canon with 850 and toshiba with 830 
ge which until 1986 had held the no 1 spot for 25 years was 
fourth with 782 patents 
ge executives at the companys rampd center located in a sprawling 
complex of buildings overlooking the mohawk river dispute the 
results of the patent study done by computer horizons a consulting 
company they argue ge would still rank as patent leader if the 
study had included patents granted to rca which ge acquired in 1986 
whoever did the study obviously didnt know rca was a 
subsidiary of ge said james c davis jr manager of patent and 
legal operations at ge 
top ge officials though see the study as a warning 
it doesnt mean we shouldnt be concerned said walter robb 
vice president of corporate research and development at ge there 
are still three japanese companies in the top four 
moreover the japanese are beating the united states is their 
ability to rapidly commercialize inventions such as the vcr 
we get out of the starting block fast schmitt said but we 
lose it on the long stretch weve lost the ability to do the long 
haul 
americas best hope in its competition with japan may be its 
education system the united states is far ahead of japan in an area 
vital to technological and scientific development the encouragement 
of creative thought 
yet serious problems exist in americas education system 
we have fewer and fewer students with an interest in science 
and technology said schmitt a former chairman of the national 
science board 
he believes that for the united states to remain no 1 in science 
and technology it must in some ways imitate the japanese 
the japanese understand that manufacturability and customer 
preferences are integral parts of the innovation process not 
afterthoughts schmitt said i see no reason why we americans 
cant renew our skills at the application of science and technology 
while maintaining our strength as pioneers

picture this youve just undergone extensive 
surgery for which the insurance company has picked up most of the 
tab but by years end youre suddenly forced to pay taxes on those 
benefits just as if they were part of your regular income 
then youre socked with taxes on other companysponsored extras 
like the group life insurance policy or the subsidized daycare 
program and night classes even those daily meals in the company 
cafeteria arent safe 
welcome to section 89 known to some tax experts and companies as 
the twilight zone of the 1986 tax reform law 
while its unlikely such a nightmarish scenario could occur the 
potential is in place under the littleknown provision that mandates 
changes in corporate americas employeebenefit structure starting 
next year 
the intention of the new rules had been to encourage employers to 
offer health insurance and other benefits to more of their workers 
and more democratically but many tax experts say the opposite is 
likely to occur and the harsh penalties for companies that break 
the law could create a slew of tax hardships for employees 
section 89 is divided into two parts one requires businesses to 
communicate to their employees exactly what benefits are being 
offered and the qualifications for receiving them failure to spell 
these out means employees must include the entire value of the 
benefits in their gross income 
if an employees health insurance paid out 50000 for surgery 
he could be taxed on that amount explained thomas j zesk a 
senior manager with deloitte haskins amp sells 
and if companies fail to report that income on their employees 
w2 tax form they can be fined he said 
most big companies already have written benefit plans in place 
so their employees need not worry about paying taxes on important 
health benefits or on the savings derived from companysubsidized 
childcare programs or meals in the cafeteria tax experts say 
those requirements of section 89 will hit small businesses the 
hardest 
even if companies fail to comply the penalties are so 
draconian that they probably wouldnt be imposed said thomas 
veal a senior manager with the accounting firm of touche ross amp co 
but the other portion of section 89 which deals with 
discriminatory benefits plans has many companies concerned 
experts say 
the new law says that if toppaid company executives those 
making around 52230 a year or more are given more health or life 
insurance benefits than lesserpaid employees the top brass must 
pay taxes on the excess 
the idea was to encourage companies to distribute benefits 
equally especially to the 37 million americans who currently dont 
have health insurance 
the intent was somewhat noble but i think they went overboard 
its a prime example of overkill zesk said 
in order to comply with this part of the new rules companies must 
submit to a lengthy testing procedure that determines whether 
benefits are available to at least 90 percent of the work force 
including parttimers who work at least 175 hours a week 
tax experts say that many companies may just find it cheaper to 
pay their executives more money to make up for the taxes theyll pay 
on the cushier benefits than to provide more benefits for the 
rankandfile employees 
others may decide to cut back on the core benefits provided to 
everyone or else make do with fewer parttimers they say 
for now companies across the country are working with accounting 
firms to prepare for section 89 
some clients have gathered the data for the testing procedure 
and are going forward and some are still at the stumped and 
disbelief stage said veal

barely more than three years ago the 
williams companies and career pipeliner roy wilkens decided to take 
a risk in the fledgling technology of fiberoptic communications 
overnight wilkens went from being president of a successful 
pipeline company to a dingy basement office surrounded by cardboard 
boxes where he had only six employees at first he didnt even 
have a telephone 
my god wilkens said he thought to himself what have i got 
myself into 
although it didnt look that way at first he and the company 
whose fortunes had been tied almost exclusively to the cyclical 
fates of the energy industry were about to leap to light speed 
the new technology allows strands of optical glass as thin as 
hairs encased in underground cables to carry huge volumes of 
information via bursts of laser light 
comparing the quality of fiberoptic transmissions to regular 
telephone lines wilkens said is like comparing a compact disk to a 
78rpm record 
the absence of noise from radio frequency and electromagnetic 
interference means both voice and computer data can be digitalized 
and sent long distances in less time for less money 
wilkens 45 was president of williams pipe line a subsidiary of 
the williams companies when the company first began exploring new 
uses for its outofservice petroleum pipelines in 1985 
at the same time regional telecommunications companies were 
tapping williams pipelinebuilding expertise for fiberoptic cable 
someone suggested williams could run fiberoptic cables through 
its old pipelines 
thats how we really stumbled into the business wilkens 
said we decided to go ahead and make that move and not look back 
we moved into it very quickly and we were extremely successful 
the parent company quickly invested 200 million in the 
fiberoptic system the national society of professional engineers 
selected the companys 3800mile network as one of the outstanding 
engineering achievements of 1986 
by the end of 1987 when the williams telecommunications company 
merged with ldx net inc to become williams telecommunications 
group it had more than 5000 miles of fiberoptic line 
at the end of 1987 the telecommunications companys annualized 
revenues had reached 109 million from an annual rate of 8 million 
at the beginning of that year 
wtg surged into profitability this year well ahead of 
expectations with a thirdquarter operating profit of 53 million 
compared with an operating loss of 78 million in the third quarter 
of 1987 
wtg will complete construction of its own fiber optic cable to 
new york next month to replace a line it had been leasing 
the company is expanding from chicago to new york by purchasing a 
400mile fiberoptic line and constructing a 500mile segment 
pushing its total to more than 6000 miles 
we found some difficulty in selling to major corporations when 
you really dont own and control your own network wilkens said 
its a very real advantage a lot of people say 40 percent of all 
communications traffic comes into and goes out of new york 
wtg boasts it is the first network to offer highly reliable 
fiberoptic communications capability from new york to los angeles 
and san francisco 
wilkens said it means his company has joined the big leagues with 
american telephone amp telegraph co mci communications corp and us 
sprint communications corp 
we all of a sudden within 36 to 40 months have gone from the 
point of lets see if we can get into this business to being the 
fourth network wilkens said from the companys new hightech 
highstyle corporate headquarters overlooking downtown tulsa 
wtg sells capacity both to other communications companies and to 
private businesses but plans to expand its commercial sales efforts 
of the fortune 2000 companies were into half of them of the 
fortune 100 companies were into half of them wilkens said 
for a little tulsa company to go into those major corporations and 
to sell them services is not an easy task 
almost every single major carrier in the country uses us with 
the exception of atampt wilkens said and if you look at most of 
their network maps and the marketing literature that they put out 
they show their fiberoptic network which is our fiberoptic 
network 
wilkens said his company had a leg up on the industry because it 
knew how to build underground pipelines across country it was 
familiar with the environmental restrictions the negotiations for 
rightofway and the need to avoid areas where construction 
activity could cause line breaks 
earlier this year wtg opened a futuristic 24 million control 
center in tulsa that monitors 11000 miles of fiber lines for a 
fivemember consortium called the national telecommunications 
network 
the customized system provides constant information about the 
performance of the network and its dozens of repeater stations the 
center keeps in constant contact with a force of 200 technicians who 
patrol the lines 
wilkens said the company is proud of its reliability which 
approaches 99999 percent 
thats one way were trying to differentiate ourselves in the 
marketplace wilkens said 
reliability is crucial for customers who count on digital 
telecommunications to do banking schedule airline flights operate 
car telephones order catalog merchandise and dispatch truckers 
crosscountry 
wilkens said competition following the breakup of atampt has made 
it all possible 
i think if the industry stayed regulated the way it was there 
was no big need to try to develop technologically the revolution 
that were seeing the information society the information age 
wilkens said

the number of new construction contracts rose in 
november with the bulk of the increase from nonresidential 
building projects a businessresearch company reported thursday 
the fw dodge group of mcgrawhill information services co said 
that new construction projects were up 3 percent last month over 
october to an annualized value of 2467 billion construction 
contracts rose 1 percent in october following three straight monthly 
declines 
setting the pace for the november increase was the 
nonresidential building sector which rose a seasonally adjusted 7 
percent to an annualized value of 809 billion the report said 
newly started housing was up 4 percent to an annualized value of 
1260 billion with continued strength in onefamily houses it 
said 
nonbuilding construction which includes public works and 
utility projects declined 9 percent to an annualized value of 398 
billion the report said 
although novembers contracting was helped by a rare spurt of 
office building it has been the consistency of demand for single 
family homes that has been the main support of the construction 
sector throughout 1988 said george a christie a mcgrawhill 
economist 
until the expected rise of mortgage rates materializes 
homebuilding is making the difference between a sharp decline and a 
gentle letdown from last years peak of total construction 
activity 
for the first 11 months new construction starts on an unadjusted 
basis totaled 2334 billion down 2 percent from the same period in 
1987 the report said 
the west with a 2 percent rise over last year was the only 
major region to show a gain in 1988 the south and the northeast had 
11 month declines of 5 percent and 4 percent respectively according 
to the report

a federal judge presiding over a ratehike suit 
against the long island lighting co issued an order thursday 
temporarily barring the financially shaky utility from paying 
dividends to shareholders 
company spokesman joseph mcdonnell sought to minimize the impact 
of the order saying the company had not paid dividends since 1984 
he said lilco had no immediate plans to resume payments 
the temporary restraining order issued by us district judge 
jack b weinstein of brooklyn is in effect until next wednesday when 
weinstein has scheduled a hearing for lilco to argue why it should 
be lifted 
weinstein is seeking a settlement of suffolk countys successful 
civil racketeering suit against lilco an accord that could possibly 
include closing the controversial shoreham nuclear power plant in 
the long island county 
closed negotiations have been held for about two weeks 
a jury earlier this month found that the utility had lied to 
state officials about the progress of the shoreham plant to obtain 
rate increases in 1978 and 1984 the jury awarded 228 million in 
damages to suffolk 
i think this is really the judge trying to assert his authority 
and to show everybody how tough hes going to be and to force the 
parties to negotiate a settlement to this whole thing said barry 
abramson a senior utilities analyst with prudentialbache 
abramson downplayed the effect the order may have on wall street 
the actual order is not significant in my opinion because lilco 
couldnt pay the dividends anyway he said i think that lilco 
has no ability and no desire to pay any dividends in the short run 
the restraining order was issued in response to a request by 
judith vladeck an attorney representing ratepayers 
in albany on wednesday the state public service commission 
denied lilcos request for an immediate 54 percent rate increase 
and said it would reconsider the utilitys request again on jan 25

americans should expect to pay more to dress up 
gas up light up and eat out in 1989 but staying in will probably 
cost less according to a report released thursday by standard amp 
poors corp 
in its annual forecast the businessinformation concern 
predicted moderate inflation for next year with consumer prices 
rising between 45 percent and 5 percent that compares with an 
increase of around 425 percent this year 
the survey said that prices on new clothing are expected to be 
between 5 percent and 10 percent higher in 1989 while the cost of 
cigarettes should jump around 10 percent 
among its other findings 
eating or and going to the movies should cost 3 percent to 5 
percent more 
insurance premiums for homeowners should rise 7 percent to 10 
percent 
gasoline should cost about 5 cents more a gallon 
food in general should rise about 4 percent 
prices for videocassettes and compact discs should decline 
electricity and home furnishings should hold steady 
the federal reserves renewed efforts to contain price 
increases by boosting interest rates will help keep a lid on 
inflation for the time being said david m blitzer sampps chief 
economist 
however while the current inflation rate is moderate and 
certainly tolerable it is creeping upward 
blitzer noted that unemployment remains at a 14year low and 
business capacity utilization is on the rise two factors that could 
rekindle higher inflation unless economic policy changes are made

at noon local time friday and reopen on tuesday

soviet union 
cathy leow an assistant vice president with thomson mckinnon 
securities inc in new york said the corn business was expected and 
the meal sale was offset by losses in the soybean oil pit 
weve also had a lot of overhead resistance to higher soybean 
and meal prices she said once you take out those levels the 
markets going to go like gangbusters but until you breach them 
people are taking a more cautious approach 
at the close wheat was 1 cents lower to 1 cent higher with the

takeover investor paul bilzerian indicted last 
week for alleged securities fraud and other charges will be 
arraigned jan 5 the manhattan us attorneys office said thursday 
bilzerian was to have been arraigned thursday but us 
attorneys office spokeswoman carol weiss said it was postponed 
because of unspecified scheduling conflicts at an arraignment a 
defendant is formally charged with an offense and can enter a plea 
the 38yearold resident of st petersburg fla has asserted he 
is innocent and has blamed the indictment on what he calls 
overzealous prosecutors seizing on adverse publicity about hostile 
corporate takeovers 
bilzerian was indicted dec 21 by a federal grand jury in 
manhattan for 12 counts of securities fraud tax fraud conspiracy 
and making false statements to the securities and exchange 
commission 
the charges stem from an investigation into his unsuccessful 
takeover attempts on hammermill paper co hh robertson co 
cluett peabody amp co and armco inc 
earlier this year bilzerian made his first successful takeover 
bid a 106 billion acquisition of the defense contractor singer co 
people familiar with the bilzerian case have said evidence was 
derived partly from disclosures by boyd jefferies a stock trading 
professional whose los angeles brokerage handled some of bilzerians 
transactions 
jefferies has been cooperating with a government probe into 
financial fraud since early 1987 when he was implicated by ivan f 
boesky the insider trader now serving a threeyear prison term for 
securities fraud

the united states has started an investigation 
into complaints that britain and other european countries unfairly 
restrict imports of american copper scrap the government announced 
wednesday 
if the investigation and proposed mediation efforts fail to 
resolve the dispute within 18 months the united states can then 
retaliate against the europeans 
in accordance with procedures for investigating such complaints 
the us trade representative has asked european economic community 
to agree to consultations 
if consultations with the europeans fail to yield satisfactory 
results said ustr spokesman cary walker the united states will 
take its case to international arbitration 
the investigation comes at a time of strained relations between 
the united states and the eec over a ban which the europeans plan to 
implement jan 1 on us meat treated with hormones the united 
states plans to retaliate against the europeans with 100 percent 
duties on a variety of imported foods and beverages

way to the hormone dispute the petition was filed on nov 14 and 
by law the ustr had to respond within 45 days he said 
the copper and brass fabricators council which represents 
american manufacturers contends its members lose 180 million 
annually in revenues because of quotas set by the europeans 
copper scrap is used to make such products as door knobs brass 
lamps and guard rails 
since september 1985 the united states has accepted 65 to 70 
petitions of complaint from us manufacturers against foreign 
competitors and acted on 27 either through international mediation

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply fell in the week ended dec 19 the federal reserve board 
reported thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 fell to a seasonally 
adjusted 30658 billion from 30667 billion the previous week 
an even broader measure m3 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 
39028 billion from 39053 billion 
the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 fell to a 
seasonally adjusted 7855 billion from a revised 7872 billion

and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual 
growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent which is 
slightly lower than the 1987 target of 55 percent to 85 percent 
the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 since early 1987

palais royal and bealls two fashion retail 
outlets in the southwest were acquired thursday by an investment 
group formed by bain capital a boston investment firm 
during the the past several years bain capital has obtained 15 
companies that operate in a variety of retail and manufacturing 
businesses 
palais royal and bealls will operate under a newly formed holding 
company specialty retailers inc bernard fuchs president and chief 
executive officer of palais royal will serve as chairman president 
and chief executive officer of the holding company 
the palais royal transaction will provide about 90 million to 
the shareholders plus other considerations said moselle pollack 
chairman of palais royal 
the purpose of this sale is to ensure the continuation of those 
successful methods that have been utilized in the past and to 
foster the growth of our fine retail establishment in the future 
mrs pollack said 
bealls was founded as a partnership in henderson texas in 1923 
by brothers robbie and archie beall three months later their 
brother wf willie beall joined the family partnership and 
served as the companys president until his death in 1953 
terms of the bealls transaction werent disclosed 
josh bekenstein a partner of bain capital said the combination 
of palais royal with bealls creates a quality fashion retailer of 
significant magnitude for the southwest 
the palais royal acquisition received heavy publicity because 
moselle pollack is the wife of a manhattan federal judge milton 
pollack who has been presiding over a civil fraud case by the 
securities and exchange commission against drexel burnham lambert 
inc which helped finance the deal 
drexel had argued that its indirect financial relationship with 
the judge should have compelled him to quit the case which remains 
stalled over the issue of his impartiality 
the outcome of the civil case has been clouded further by 
drexels agreement last week to plead guilty to six felony counts 
and pay a record 650 million in fines and restitution to settle a 
criminal securities fraud probe 
that agreement with the manhattan us attorneys office is 
contingent on drexels settlement of the sec civil charges

march contract traded as high as 1596 a pound the highest coffee 
futures price since nov 14 1986 
poor growing and harvesting conditions in central and south 
america have cut deeply into the availability of green coffee 
forcing us roasters to pay higher prices to obtain supplies for 
the winter months when coffee consumption reaches its annual peak 
the recent rapid rise in prices a gain of more than 30 cents a 
pound since dec 1 has also prompted roasters to buy march coffee 
futures as a hedge against futher price increases on the cash 
market analysts said 
bert ruiz a coffee broker with balfour maclaine corp in new 
york said the widening price gap between the march and may coffee 
contracts indicated that demand for nearterm supplies was 
continuing to grow the march contracts price rose by nearly 7 
cents a pound wednesday while may deliveries advanced by just over 
48 cents 
this is a demanddriven market ruiz said roasters are 
flocking to march and selling may because they believe theres going 
to be an acute tightness of quality beans in march whereby by may 
it should be relieved 
the tightsupply situation should ease during the second quarter 
of 1989 as more newly harvested beans reach the market and 
consumption begins a seasonal decline he said 
platinum futures prices rebounded after hitting resistance near 
500 a troy ounce on the new york mercantile exchange but gold and 
silver futures posted significant losses on new yorks commodity

soybean meal to the soviet union

600000metric ton meal sale was offset by losses in the soybean oil

a yearend search for bargains among bluechip 
issues propelled stock prices to a broad rally on thursday that left 
the markets bestknown gauge only a shade below its highest closing 
level this year 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which gained 375 points 
on wednesday climbed another 1625 to close at 218268 
that was less than a point below its 1988 closing high of 
218350 reached on oct 21 which also was the highest close since 
the october 1987 crash 
at midafternoon the bluechip index was slightly above the 
years high closing mark but it lost some ground by the end of the 
session 
as the market heads into its final trading session of the year 
the dow jones industrial average is about 126 percent above its 
1987 close of 193883 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
987 up 477 down and 524 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 13129 million 
shares up from 11063 million in the previous session 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 16014 million shares 
analysts said yearend bargain hunting was mainly responsible for 
boosting prices 
michael metz market analyst for oppenheimer amp co inc said 
most of the institutional investors who wanted to sell have already 
done so so when you get some nibbling by bargainhunters it is 
easy to lift the dow jones industrial average with no supply 
around he said 
the analysts said the gains also reflected efforts by some 
institutional investors to spruce up their endofyear portfolios or 
put some excess cash to work by adding some topquality issues 
with the market near its highs for the year the large cash 
position that some money managers find themselves with is 
embarrassing said newton d zinder senior vice president at 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
he said the gains also demonstrated relief that the stock market 
held its ground earlier this week despite rising interest rates 
yields on some shortterm treasury issues for instance have 
risen above 9 percent and pose increasing competition for the 
uncertain returns on stocks 
in the credit markets thursday prices and yields were fairly 
stable 
the view is that the fed will not raise the discount rate right

a federal judge lifted a restraining order 
preventing the long island lighting co from paying stock dividends 
after the financially shaky utility agreed thursday to notify the 
court 10 days before issuing any dividends 
us district judge jack b weinstein who is presiding over the 
ratehike suit against lilco issued the restraining order in the 
morning but lifted it seven hours later 
shortly after the order was signed a company spokesman minimized 
its impact saying the company had not paid dividends since 1984 and 
had no immediate plans to resume payments 
weinstein scheduled a hearing on the issue for next wednesday 
the judge is seeking a settlement of suffolk countys successful 
civil racketeering suit against lilco an accord that could possibly 
include closing the controversial shoreham nuclear power plant 
closed negotiations have been ongoing for about two weeks 
a jury earlier this month found that the utility had lied to 
state officials about the progress of the shoreham plant to obtain 
rate increases in 1978 and 1984 the jury awarded 228 million in 
damages to suffolk 
weinstein must now decide whether to certify a class of 
ratepayers in the suit making lilco liable for at least 4 billion 
i think this is really the judge trying to assert his authority 
and to show everybody how tough hes going to be and to force the 
parties to negotiate a settlement to this whole thing said barry 
abramson a senior utilities analyst with prudentialbache 
abramson downplayed the effect the temporary order would have on 
wall street 
the actual order is not significant in my opinion because lilco 
couldnt pay the dividends anyway he said i think that lilco 
has no ability and no desire to pay any dividends in the short run 
on thursday lilco closed at 13 per share on the new york stock 
exchange up 25 cents 
the restraining order was issued in response to a request by 
judith vladeck the attorney representing the proposed class of 
ratepayers said these payments would total about 1 billion 
in view of lilcos limited net worth payment of such dividends 
would severely reduce lilcos ability to pay a judgement awarded 
to the proposed plaintiff class she wrote in an affidavit it 
would further severely impair the likelihood of achieving a fair and 
reasonable settlement on behalf of the plaintiff class 
in albany on wednesday the state public service commission 
denied lilcos request for an immediate 54 percent rate increase 
and said it would reconsider the utilitys request again on jan 25

lorimar telepictures corp said it has 
completed the sale of two television stations in puerto rico in a 
deal the tv production company says removes a major obstacle to its 
12 billion merger with warner communications inc 
lorimar producer of dallas alf and other tv series 
said thursday it sold wliitv in san juan and wsurtv in ponce to a 
florida investment group headed by timothy brumlik of orlando fla 
terms of the deal were not disclosed 
lorimars ownership of the puerto rican stations and of wpghtv 
in pittsburgh had stymied new yorkbased warners plan to buy 
lorimar for approximately 12 billion in stock 
warners biggest shareholder chriscraft industries inc got a 
court order in august blocking the deal on grounds it violated a 
1984 agreement signed when warner and chriscraft bought shares in 
each other the agreement which gave warner 425 percent of 
chriscrafts bhc inc television subsidiary barred warner from 
owning other television stations 
lorimar owned six stations when it agreed to merge with warner 
sale of the puerto rican stations leaves only wpgh and the company 
has reached an agreement in principle to sell that to renaissance 
communications organized by investor michael finkelstein and 
warburg pincus capital 
the warner buyout is expected to be consummated in january 
lorimar said in a news release apparently indicating sale of the 
pittsburgh station will be completed by then 
a call to chriscrafts new york offices late thursday was not 
returned

federal regulators working against a yearend 
tax deadline announced the sale of 13 more insolvent savings and 
loan institutions in texas and illinois on thursday 
the latest deals brought to 197 the number of insolvent sampls 
which have been dealt with by federal officials this year a 
postdepression record far surpassing the 48 sampls closed in 1987 
officials predicted that they are sure to top the target of 
dealing with 200 failed sampls this year before a midnight deadline 
saturday when tax breaks for the buyers of ailing sampls will be cut 
in half 
the latest takeovers included the first purchase of texas 
institutions by foreigners a group of investors from taiwan agreed 
to buy eight insolvent texas institutions 
the latest deals followed two of the largest bailouts of sampls 
the government announced wednesday it was pledging assistance 
totaling 68 billion to the purchasers of a huge california 
institution and five of the most financially troubled texas sampls 
the agreements thursday were announced after the threemember 
federal home loan bank board spent the day huddled behind closed 
doors reviewing offers 
in one of the deals eight insolvent texas sampls were sold to 
pacific usa holdings corp a texas subsidiary of a taiwanese 
company which agreed to invest 375 million to purchase the sampls 
the branches will be operated under the name pacific southwest 
savings bank fsb headquartered in corpus christi 
the bank board agreed to provide 5662 million in government 
assistance to the purchasers 
bank board chairman m danny wall hailed the sale to the 
taiwanese investors saying we welcome our first nonus owned 
investor to the southwest plan the program for dealing with sick 
sampls in texas their interest in investing in the future of texas 
is a further indication of the attractiveness of the states thrift 
industry as well as its business climate which is what weve been 
saying all along 
the sampls being purchased were charter savings and loan of corpus 
christi keystone savings and loan of lampasas bayview federal 
savings association of corpus christi first federal savings and 
loan of luling independence savings and loan of gonzales yoakum 
federal savings and loan of yoakum union savings association of san 
antonio and sequin savings association of sequin 
a second sale involved four insolvent texas thrifts which were 
purchased by the centex corp a dallas home builder who will 
operate the former branches as texas trust savings bank fsb in 
that transaction the bank board will provide 429 million in 
government assistance and centex will invest 265 million 
the insolvent sampls purchased by centex were burnet savings and 
loan of burnet lee savings association of giddings ranchers 
savings association of johnson city and peoples savings and loan of 
llano 
the third deal involved the sale of american savings bank of 
springfield ill at a cost to the government of 1879 million 
the insolvent sampl was being taken over by citizens federal bank of 
miami which will operate americans 23 offices as branches of 
citizens federal citizens federal is investing no money in the deal 
federal regulators faced new criticism on thursday about their 
yearend rush to close insolvent sampls but they continued to insist 
that the cost to the government of simply closing the institutions 
and paying off depositors would far exceed the sales being arranged 
which use tax breaks and direct federal assistance as a lure for 
private investors 
the tax benefits will be effectively cut in half after midnight 
saturday the provisions that will expire allow firms who purchased 
failed sampls to deduct the previous losses of those associations from 
profits the firms earned on other operations 
in virtually all of transactions completed in 1988 the firms 
taking over the sampls will qualify for tax breaks that will far 
exceed what they are paying for the institutions 
congressional critics have questioned these tax benefits 
contending that the bank board is rushing the sales through without 
a proper analysis of the revenue loss to the federal government 
in a letter to wall sen james sasser dtenn and the new 
chairman of the senate budget committee said i have serious 
questions about the impact your plans will have on the federal 
budget the competitive balance of the remaining thrift industry and 
the concentration of power without our financial systems 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas and the new chairman of the house 
banking committee said he plans to hold a series of hearings 
looking especially at the two largest bailouts announced this week 
involving 68 billion in government assistance in the sale of a 
california sampl to texas billionaire robert bass and the purchase of 
five deeply troubled texas sampls by a group headed by revlon 
cosmetics chairman ronald perelman 
all of the bank boards eleventhhour deals will be reviewed by 
the house banking committee he said in a statement we will be 
looking at whether the bank board has been getting the best deals 
possible 
wall called the bass purchase a major achievement of an 
extremely eventful 1988 because it took off the governments hands 
american savings of stockton calif the countrys largest 
insolvent sampl 
congress and the incoming bush administration will be looking for 
ways to finance the remaining 400 insolvent sampls estimates of the 
total cost to the government of resolving the sampl mess range from 
50 billion to 112 billion with even the low figure certain to 
swell the federal budget deficit 
industry losses from the insolvent institutions are mounting by 
1 billion a month 
for this reason analysts said presidentelect bush cannot 
afford to delay dealing with the problem treasury secretary 
nicholas brady who is remaining in his job in the new 
administration has already launched a study to find ways to finance 
the rescue effort 
the bush administration will be committing political suicide if 
it doesnt candidly address this problem immediately after taking 
office said bert ely a financial consultant based in alexandria 
va 
all of the sampls being taken over this week have been insolvent 
for several years but have been kept open because the governments 
insurance fund the federal savings and loan insurance corp did 
not have enough cash to pay off depositors and shut the institutions 
down

pepperidge farm inc prompted by what it 
called strong consumer concern has announced plans to remove a 
coconut oil from its crackers and cookies by next summer 
officials of the norwalkbased company said the oil will be 
removed from such products as the popular original goldfish 
coconut oil is a saturated fat that raises the cholesterol level 
people who have high levels of cholesterol run a higher risk of a 
clogging of the arteries that can lead to heart attacks 
we must find oils that will proximate tropical oils in terms of 
performance in the baking process flavor texture mouthfeel and 
shelflife stability richard a shea president of pepperidge 
farm said in a prepared statement issued wednesday 
phil sokolof founder of national heart savers a nebraska 
organization that has campaigned against products which use tropical 
oils such as palm and coconut said he was pleased by pepperidge

cookies and crackers 
ultimately pepperidge farms will have saved thousands of 
lives sokolof said theyve got a tough job of reformulating 
their cookies and crackers 
sokolof said coconut oil contains 100 percent more saturated fat 
than lard 
coconut and palm oil are popular because they help extend the 
shelf life of food products sokolof said many products advertised 
as being free of cholesterol contain tropical oils that can help 
cholesterol form after consumption he said 
ann wainright a pepperidge farm spokeswoman has said her 
company recently began using 100 percent soybean oil in all its 
breads 
kellogg co of battle creek mich announced dec 12 that it had 
stopped using tropical oils in its cracklin oat bran cereal
