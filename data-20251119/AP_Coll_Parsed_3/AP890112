a salvadoran accused of conspiring in the 1980 
assassination of archbishop oscar romero was freed on bail thursday 
night after his homelands high court denied a request for his 
extradition his attorney said 
alvaro saravia had been ordered held by president jose napoleon 
duartes government which accused him of arranging romeros 
assassination on orders of rightwing legislator roberto 
daubuisson who denied the allegation 
saravia telephoned one of my associates at 830 tonight and 
told him im out said his miami attorney neal sonnett saravia 
was released on 10000 bond pending deportation hearings he said 
the salvadoran supreme court ruled last month there wasnt enough 
evidence linking saravia to the murder and said he would not be 
subject to arrest if he were sent home 
saravia a former captain in el salvadors air force had been 
jailed in miami since november 1987 when he was arrested for a 
traffic violation and authorities found he had been in the country 
illegally since 1985 
the salvadoran government withdrew its extradition request after 
its courts ruled that there were no grounds for arresting him on 
charges he had violated his visa and that the extradition request 
itself was illegal 
romero an outspoken critic of rightwing death squads was shot 
by a sniper while saying mass in san salvador on march 24 1980 
in november 1987 president jose napoleon duartes government 
accused saravia of arranging the assassination and released the 
testimony of amadeo garay reyes who allegedly drove the sniper to 
the church 
the supreme court ruled that garays testimony was not credible 
partly because he waited more than seven years to come forward with 
his story 
the court also said attorney general giron flores did not have 
the constitutional power to ask the united states to send saravia 
back to el salvador 
flores had directly asked the united states for saravias 
extradition the case went to the supreme court after saravias 
attorney requested a hearing 
sonnett who is also representing panamanian gen manuel antonio 
noriega against federal drug charges here said saravia had gone 
home to his wife who has been living in miami

wilburt siegel the 73yearold cancer 
victim jailed in a dispute over a sewer hookup was freed thursday 
after a state prison and a county jail both refused to accept him as 
a prisoner 
siegel spent wednesday night in the lieber correctional 
institution in ridgeville but he was released after state officials 
decided they lacked authority to imprison an inmate for civil 
contempt of court 
siegel was then sent back to charleston county but sheriff al 
cannon said the county jail couldnt house him because it is 
overcrowded 
he also said the jail didnt have the medical facilities to treat 
siegel who suffers from rectal cancer 
charleston attorney gedney howe then asked for a hearing before 
circuit judge william howell who found siegel in contempt last 
november 
al cannon and i came to the same conclusion if he couldnt go 
to lieber he sure couldnt go to the county jail howe said 
before the hearing howe said he and the judge discussed options 
in the case and said howell said a motion to appeal the contempt 
order could be considered 
i appealed the judges opinion which will postpone him siegel 
going back to jail howe said he said appeals to the state 
supreme court can take some time and hopefully hell be a free man 
for at least several months 
judge howell today looked at a difficult problem and found a 
way out that was satisfactory to everybody and was legally 
correct howe said 
were so weary and thankful and were just going to go to 
bed siegels wife hattie said later from the couples home 
its been a rough day 
the contempt order stems from siegels refusal to obey an earlier 
1986 court order that he connect his james island home to a sewer 
line 
the siegels have had a decadelong dispute with the james island 
public service district over connecting the sewer 
they say the tapin point is too far from their septic tank and 
would cost them an additional 2000 and cause them to destroy 
several large pine trees in order to make the connection 
francis x archibald a spokesman for the state department of 
corrections said the issue arose as to whether lieber should house 
the prisoner after siegel arrived at the prison wednesday 
they referred it to the departments legal advisor in columbia 
who researched the matter and he said we lacked the authority to 
house a prisoner jailed for civil contempt archibald said 
he said the decision was based on an attorney generals opinion 
of some years back 
the siegel case was later the topic of a discussion between 
corrections department legal advisor larry batson and state attorney 
general travis medlock and medlock concurred in the decision 
archibald said 
on wednesday cannon escorted siegel from the modest james island 
house which was draped with an american flag and where yellow 
ribbons were tied around five large pine trees 
siegel said he was going to prison for his principles and that he 
had been treated unfairly compared to other residents in the area 
who had sewer lines closer to their homes or had not been forced to 
hook onto the sewer

south carolina is home to wealthy cotton 
plantations stately antebellum mansions and a growing share of 
americas toxic wastes 
now with a 10yearold waste landfills license up for renewal 
a debate is looming over the states role as the nations septic 
tank 
we have been taken advantage of said state rep harry 
hallman who resigned in november as chairman of the department of 
health and environmental control to take a seat in the house of 
representatives hes pushing legislation that would tighten state 
control of waste disposal 
the gsx chemical services inc landfill in sumter county is one 
of two commercial hazardous waste landfills in the southeast the 
other is in alabama and is the tomb for a halfmillion tons of 
chemicals south carolina is also home to two hazardouswaste 
incinerators and one for infectious waste the barnwell lowlevel 
nuclear waste landfill and the troubled savannah river plant that 
produces nuclear bomb fuel 
it all plays in the reason gsx has become an issue is not 
because it is the only issue but because its a symbolic issue 
said democratic state sen phil leventis a longtime critic of the 
landfill 
some 130000 tons of chemical garbage will be buried at gsx this 
year about 70 percent from industries in more than 30 other states 
and puerto rico two incinerators in roebuck and rock hill can 
accept a total of 58920 tons a year of hazardous waste 75 percent 
is from other states a third can take 36500 tons of infectious 
waste which comes from 10 states and canada 
the chemnuclear systems inc lowlevel radioactive waste 
landfill at barnwell the only one in operation in the nation 
took 900000 cubic feet of contaminated clothing tools and other 
debris in 1988 and expects the same this year 
the state produces 85000 tons of hazardous waste a year 
according to the health department it has plenty of room for its 
neighbors garbage 
it seems were a patsy for somebody doesnt it it seems that 
the federal government has found a place that doesnt resist said 
shelly green of sumter a retired hotel manager and air force major 
it just seems that were getting more than our share 
i feel that at some point in time that place will be a real 
problem to us and that we shouldnt be required to take other 
states waste 
the 279acre gsx landfill opened in 1978 its bottom rests 10 
feet above an aquifer and its lip is 400 yards from lake marion one 
of the santee cooper lakes created in world war ii to provide 
hydroelectric power to underdeveloped areas and charlestons 
defenserelated industries 
state and company officials say the hard claystone from which the 
landfill is carved makes it a natural location but siting standards 
for hazardous waste landfills are only now being drafted and are not 
expected before the end of 1989 dhec has decided not to wait for 
the standards to make a decision on the landfills permit and 
officials say they can be applied retroactively 
gsx encases its waste in two layers of clay 3 feet and 5 feet 
thick separated by two hard plastic liners and a leak detection 
system the waste is tested on arrival to ensure that its not 
flammable radioactive explosive or laced with dioxin then it is 
mixed with concrete and buried 
gsx is doing a good job in doing what theyre doing i think 
theyre handling it in a safe manner said gov carroll campbell 
some area opponents however say constantly changing burial 
requirements have made them unwilling participants in a test of 
developing technology 
when federal regulations changed in 1985 from one layer of clay 
and plastic to two earlier burial cells were not retrofitted and a 
monitoring system crucial for detecting leaks has been upgraded from 
eight to about 50 wells since 1983 
as technology progresses we adopt it said gsx vice 
president roger davis certainly nobodys claiming perfection but 
we just do the best we know how to do 
hallman a republican who calls south carolina the septic tank 
of the nation has organized a bipartisan environmental caucus of 
18 state house and senate members he hopes will push legislation 
endorsed by the dhec board phasing out permanent burial of chemical 
waste by 1992 and creating a stateowned disposal site so south 
carolina could refuse outofstate waste 
court rulings have said that prohibitions on outofstate waste 
headed to a private facility interfere with interstate commerce 
the dhec board also called for burial fee increases from 13 to 
95 per ton for instate waste and 18 to 180 per ton for 
outofstate waste the money would go into an existing state fund 
to be used for any cleanup at the site 
a 1985 dhec study estimated that cleanup costs would approach 1 
billion if all of the landfills holding cells were breached the 
state requires only 6 million in insurance though gsx maintains a 
30 million policy 
house members rank the dhec proposals second behind the 
politically charged issue of auto insurance reform among the biggest 
issues facing them this year 
the proposals will be challenged by manufacturers including the 
states biggest industry textiles who use the gsx site 
extensively they say such moves could increase costs and mean the 
loss of jobs 
the south carolina textile manufacturers association voted in 
december to fight closing of the facility would create more 
problems than it would solve and could lead to improper disposal of 
hazardous waste in other locations said e blair rice chairman 
of the groups environmental committee 
a november public hearing on the gsx permit drew a rowdy crowd of 
2000 people many of whom stayed seven hours to berate dhec and gsx 
carol boykin who first opposed the landfill and helped organize 
citizens asking for a safe environment after a 1984 hearing says it 
has mobilized her as she expects srp and the other environmental 
dilemmas to affect others 
we grew up truly believing that government would protect us 
she said i think weve come to realize that our state and federal 
government are not necessarily going to protect us were going to 
have to protect ourselves

the long palestinian uprising has brought 
bitterness to israeli humor and the comedians opener was not meant 
to put his audience at ease 
soldiers in uniform get in with a discount yonathan geffen 
said and after a pause soldiers with clubs get in free 
he referred to beatings by soldiers of protesters in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip where more than 300 palestinians have been 
killed and thousands wounded such a joke would have been 
unthinkable before the rebellion began dec 8 1987 
in night clubs theaters and galleries artists of various kinds 
grapple with questions about the violence of occupation and the 
brutalizing effect on israeli society of the armys handling of the 
uprising 
a satire by nightclub performer dudu topaz takes the form of an 
army radio report of an incident said to have begun when a young 
palestinian urinated on a soldiers leg 
the army arrests his entire family and destroys their house and 
an officer declares on the radio the youth was known as a 
potential terrorist 
a reporter finds the perpetrator but discovers he is not yet old 
enough to talk 
performing artists have collided with those who control staterun 
radio and television topaz was barred from a radio talk show for 
two weeks for comments critical of the army 
israel television rejected a skit by comedian tuvia tzafir that 
attacked public apathy by depicting an israeli family watching tv 
while a fire raged outside 
lyrics in coexistence with love a new album by vocalist 
astar shamir accuse the government of failing to explore options 
for peace while young soldiers do the dirty work of occupation 
as one of her songs a moment before the storm puts it my 
brother isnt a cruel soldier but hes cold in his soul he stands 
there with his hand on the trigger but he hates the war dont 
send my brother to the trigger 
ms shamir said in an interview when i sat opposite the 
television last january and they started showing me what was 
happening i couldnt sleep nights i know songs dont change things 
and cant move armies but they just came pouring out 
early last year army radio banned pop singer si hymans song 
shooting and crying about soldiers who used a bulldozer to bury 
four young palestinians alive in a west bank village the victims 
survived and the soldiers were given jail terms of up to a year 
have we forgotten our children were killed too hyman asks 
in the chorus alluding to the nazi extermination of 6 million jews 
in a jaffa nightclub tzafir performs a skit accusing prime 
minister yitzhak shamir of ignoring opportunities for peace 
it depicts shamir visiting an eye doctor and refusing to read a 
wall chart that says there are palestinians and in smaller 
letters there is a chance for peace 
my vision is too good shamir says i need something to 
block all this out 
palestinians have incorporated themes of the uprising into songs 
and plays words of a protest song reflect the tendency toward 
rhetoric with the molotov gasoline bomb with the stones i 
make my revolution with the stones we get rid of the enemy 
an art exhibit at the hakawati theatre in arab east jerusalem was 
a series of portraits of palestinians killed in the rebellion the 
new play waiting for the savior depicts buffoonlike israeli 
soldiers harassing palestinians going about their daily lives 
everything is political said jamal ghosheh director of the 
theatre we are talking about our lives our lives are political 
for israeli performers who do active and reserve army duty like 
everyone else it is more complicated 
at one point in his show topaz stopped and said i wonder if i 
have the right to do this im laughing at everyone but im 
laughing at myself as well because i too am a soldier 
the comedian whose father came here from the soviet union said 
in an interview this is not the country i wanted its not the 
kind of behavior i want if someone had told my father he was coming 
to live in a country that would rule another nation he never would 
have come

president reagan took the high road in his 
farewell address after two recent attempts to blame some of his 
administrations most notable failures on congressional meddling or 
the washington establishment 
tonight isnt for arguments and im going to hold my tongue 
the president said in his televised message wednesday night 
reagan sounded positive notes reminiscent of earlier speeches 
throughout his political career the preeminent position of we 
the people in the american system the image of america as a 
shining city upon a hill the importance of paying more 
attention to american history 
there was no mention of the iron triangle of members of 
congress the news media and special interest groups who in a 
speech to political appointees in washington on dec 13 reagan 
claimed had prevented his administration from balancing the federal 
budget 
nor did he argue as he did in a speech at the university of 
virginia in charlottesville dec 16 that congress had perpetuated a 
dangerous situation in central america by its onagain offagain 
indecisiveness on his program of aid to the anticommunist contra 
rebels 
there was no mention at all of the contras the arms sales to 
iran or the enormous trade deficits that during reagans tenure have 
turned america into the worlds biggest debtor nation 
instead reagan stuck to the simple patriotic themes that have 
served him so well in his political career 
there is a great tradition of warnings in presidential 
farewells and ive got one thats been on my mind for some time 
the president said 
the bestknown such warnings are george washingtons caution in 
1797 against entangling alliances and dwight eisenhowers 
message in 1961 about the excessive influence of the 
militaryindustrial complex 
reagan did not come up with a similar catchword rather he asked 
a question are we doing a good enough job teaching our children 
what america is and what she represents in the long history of the 
world 
he didnt give an outright answer to that question but he made 
it pretty clear that he thinks things have gone awry 
younger parents arent sure that an unambivalent appreciation 
of america is the right thing to teach modern children he said 
and as for those who create the popular culture wellgrounded 
patriotism is no longer the style 
weve got to do a better job of getting across that america is 
freedom 
it was an inspirational message unlikely to arouse the kind of 
criticism that greeted his attacks on congress or the iron 
triangle 
instead of blaming congress on wednesday for his failures he 
thanked the people for his successes 
ive had my share of victories in the congress but what very 
few people noticed is that i never won anything you didnt win for 
me he said they never saw my troops they never saw reagans 
regiments the american people 
he even modestly differed from the phrase so often used to 
describe his skills at exactly what he was doing wednesday night 
i never thought it was my style or the words i used that made a 
difference it was the content he said i wasnt a great 
communicator but i communicated great things and they didnt 
spring full blown from my brow they came from the heart of a great 
nation 
my friends we did it 
in foreign affairs he said he wanted the new closeness with 
the soviet union to continue but warned that it can do so only as 
long as they continue to act in a helpful manner 
it was a sentimental speech unlikely to go into history with 
those by eisenhower or washington as they concluded their 
presidencies 
but it was a speech that celebrated what he called common 
sense and encapsulated his relationship to the people in simple 
imagery 
one of the things about the presidency is that youre always 
somewhat apart he said you spend a lot of time going by too 
fast in a car someone else is driving and seeing the people through 
tinted glass the parents holding up a child and the wave you saw 
too late and couldnt return and so many times i wanted to stop 
and reach out from behind the glass and connect 
whatever else it was it was vintage reagan

the national farmers union says it will wage a 
lobbying battle in congress against a proposal to let farmers 
collect federal subsidies without regard to the kind of crops they 
produce 
nfu president leland swenson said wednesday that the idea known 
as decoupling would be devastating for farmers and rural 
communities endanger the environment and destabilize the position 
of third world farmers 
swenson said at a news conference that decoupling would be a 
shortterm welfare program and will be opposed vigorously by nfu 
lobbyists 
the idea of decoupling has been around for years but has not had 
great support on capitol hill one of the early decisions by the 
incoming bush administration will be whether to embrace decoupling 
as a way of containing government farm costs 
under some versions of decoupling federal payments targeted to 
farmers would gradually be reduced over four or five years and 
perhaps then be eliminated altogether as producers are weaned from 
federal crop subsidies 
the nfus main rival the american farm bureau federation at one 
time supported decoupling but since has backed off to give it a 
closer look 
one of the biggest advocates is the heritage foundation a 
washingtonbased conservative think tank which recently issued a 
report saying that one of the first jobs of the bush administration 
should be to cut subsidies and get farmers off the dole 
decoupling the heritage report said would allow federal 
payments to farmers to be based on a flat rate and targeted to those 
most in need as it has been for more than half a century payments 
now are pegged to specific kinds of crops and levels of production 
the larger the farm the larger the subsidy 
under decoupling farmers would simply be given a cash payment 
and then be free to grow or not grow any crop they choose 
planting decisions would then be based on market signals 
consumer demand for a product rather than on what is required by 
washington the heritage report said 
charles grizzle who wrote the heritage report said in a 
telephone interview that decoupling makes sense as a way of getting 
crop programs away from government subsidies and into a 
marketoriented economic environment 
in my judgment its a charade now to think that most of the 
production that is linked to subsidy payments is being grown for the 
marketplace grizzle said its a mindset almost like a 
crutch 
swenson however called decoupling proposals a copout and 
released a report analyzing a decoupling bill introduced by sen 
rudy boschwitz rminn in 1985 as the family farm protection and 
full production act swenson said the bill continues to have some 
support in congress along with backing from big grain companies 
such as cargill inc 
its really a copout in addressing the real issue of adopting 
and implementing a farm program which enhances the market price for 
agricultural commodities swenson said it implies that the 
family farm structure of agriculture is not important 
the analysis used figures attributed to the institute for trade 
and agriculture of st paul minn showing that the boschwitz bill 
would reduce federal price support loans sharply for major crops 
including wheat to 160 per bushel from 206 this year and corn 
to 130 per bushel from the 1989 rate of 165 
lowering of world prices a result of decoupling would 
aggravate the situation of third world farmers who are our best 
potential customers for us food exports swenson said 
the nfu he said will draft its own alternative to decoupling to 
assure consumers an adequate and dependable supply of food and 
enhance the market price of agricultural commodities 
although swenson did not disclose details of what nfus plan 
might include he said it would reduce the budget impact of farm 
programs and allow for continued expansion of agricultural exports 
the 1988 drought helped siphon off huge stockpiles of us grain 
boosting market prices for wheat to an average of 389 per bushel 
last month from 270 a year earlier corn in december according to 
the agriculture department averaged 254 per bushel compared with 
the yearearlier mark of 172 per bushel 
swenson was asked if the nfu would recommend an increase in 
federal price supports to as much as current market prices he 
replied or higher 
the reagan administration for eight years has been committed to a 
marketoriented farm policy less reliance on federal controls and 
freer world trade those goals are expected to continue under the 
bush administration 
but swenson is not convinced at this time that foreign countries 
will go along with current us agricultural trade objectives in the 
bush administration any more than they have in the reagan years 
there isnt such a thing as a free market swenson said it 
doesnt exist will not exist either in this country or any other 
major exporting country in the world

oil refinery workers nationwide began 
returning to work wednesday ending a series of strikes and rallies 
to protest the bloody arrest of their union bosses on weapons and 
corruption charges 
the government continued its crackdown on joaquin hernandez 
galicia leader of the powerful oil workers union he and about 50 
associates have been arrested on fraud weapons and tax evasion 
charges said a spokesman for the attorney generals office 
fernando arias perez 
meanwhile authorities said two of hernandez galicias bodyguards 
who were arrested in the sweep reported that their boss ordered 
the 1983 slaying of a mayor who headed a union local officials said 
the attorney generals office said in a statement late wednesday 
that hernandez galicia told investigators he purchased scores of 
weapons in the united states 
hernandez galicia told investigators the weapons were brought 
into mexico by his good friend jose cruz contreras a former 
mayor of reynosa the statement said cruz contreras gave the 
weapons to hernandez galicia on dec 10 it said 
reynosa which has a refinery and petrochemicals plant lies 
across the us border from mcallen texas it is a stronghold of 
oil workers allied with hernandez galicia 
strikes by refinery workers broke out tuesday night after the 
arrests began the union corruption investigation is widely seen as 
a challenge to the union by the new administration of president 
carlos salinas de gortari 
guards were posted at gas stations and refineries and many 
motorists fearing shortages formed 30 and 40car lines to fill up 
their tanks at stations in mexico city tampico and other cities 
but petroleum workers began showing up at their jobs later 
wednesday after a union official called for the strikes to end 
they workers should report for work they should forget 
marches work stoppages and rallies because despite the protest of 
the union of the arbitrary arrest of its leaders we do not want to 
affect the industry or the population victor de leon acting 
coordinator of the union 
he said the message was from salvador barragan camacho the union 
secretarygeneral who was under arrest at a cardiology hospital on

his door with a bazooka rocket in a raid on his home in northeastern 
ciudad madero city the notimex state news agency said 
one federal agent was killed in the ensuing shootout with 
hernandez galicias bodyguards said attorney general enrique

took office dec 1 and mario ramon beteta who headed pemex until 
about a year ago when he left to become governor of the state of 
mexico 
salinas then budget and planning secretary and beteta had cut 
into the lucrative business hernandez galicia and the union had 
enjoyed through the control of millions of dollars in pemex 
subcontracts 
mexico is the worlds sixthlargest crude oil producer 
production from the countrys nine refineries is 14 million barrels

a texas professor who helped mount president 
nixons unsuccessful attempt to resist a key watergate subpoena is 
being considered for the post of us solicitor general 
charles alan wright 61 a civil law expert and scholar who 
helped formulate the executiveprivilege claim for refusing to 
surrender tapes of oval office conversations during the watergate 
affair is one of five or six candidates under consideration for the 
job said a source close to the selection process 
also being considered are judge ralph k winter of the 2nd us 
circuit court of appeals in new york city and judge kenneth starr of 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia said 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
they are among the candidates being considered by presidentelect 
bushs transition team in conjunction with attorney general dick 
thornburgh 
justice department sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the appointment which must be confirmed by the senate would 
not be made without thornburghs consent 
the job of the departments top legal policy maker and chief 
appellate lawyer will be vacated when solicitor general charles 
fried leaves office jan 20 to return to harvard university law 
school 
the solicitor general decides whether the government will appeal 
lower court rulings against federal agencies in virtually all cases 
he personally argues many cases before the high court 
the solicitor general is called the 10th justice in legal circles 
because he is traditionally viewed by the high court as a source of 
legal guidance 
wright a university of texas law professor served as one of 
nixons lawyers in 1973 and 1974 while the watergate special 
prosecutor was trying to subpoena the white house tapes 
he helped devise the constitutional argument that as president 
nixon was immune from judicial subpoena because of executive 
privilege 
the supreme court ruled 80 in 1974 that executive privilege did 
not protect nixon from having to surrender evidence needed in a 
criminal case the decision led to nixons resignation 
the high court ordered nixon to turn over the tapes which 
contained damaging evidence of white house involvement in the 
watergate coverup 
winter 53 a former yale university law professor who took the 
bench in 1982 and starr a fellow appointee of president reagan 
are both known as judicial conservatives 
starr who served as counselor to attorney general william french 
smith from 1981 prior to taking the bench in 1983 had been 
mentioned as a possible supreme court nominee after his former 
colleague on the district of columbia circuit robert bork failed 
to win senate confirmation in 1987 
there is speculation in the washington legal community that 
because of his relative youth the 42yearold starr would be 
willing to give up his lifetime judicial appointment to better 
position himself for a future nomination to the supreme court 
starr is an unpredictable conservative who has not always voted 
with the reagan administration on major cases before the appeals 
court here 
he is viewed by some as a more moderate member of the 
conservative wing of the circuit which also includes judges james 
l buckley douglas h ginsburg laurence silberman david sentelle 
and stephen williams 
while best known for his role as a defender of executive 
privilege during watergate wright has a formidable reputation as a 
legal scholar particularly as an expert on federal court procedure 
he is the coauthor of a multivolume standard textbook on the 
subject and has argued before the supreme court notably against the 
abolition of the death penalty and against lowering the voting age 
to 18 he lost both of those cases 
his position on the death penalty however was ultimately 
vindicated when the supreme court later reinstated capital 
punishment 
a professed conservative republican wright wrote in 1960 that he 
supported nixons presidential candidacy because i have more 
confidence in dick nixon the man than in jack kennedy the man 
but four years later wright said he would vote against barry 
goldwater because he felt the arizona senator supported a slowdown 
on civil rights and would take a harder more dangerous line on 
foreign relations

representatives of the working men and women of this country 
brown said in a statement 
brown and richard weiner the michigan state party chairman are 
viewed as the frontrunners to replace kirk brown has the support 
of many national democrats but few if any of them vote weiners

and michael barnes of maryland all five last week began a series of 
joint regional meetings around the country the dnc will pick a 
successor to kirk next month 
brown is a veteran party insider who advised the unsuccessful

to avoid identifying several latin american 
government officials as working for the central intelligence agency 
the reagan administration withheld certain documents from the trial 
of lt col oliver north the miami herald reported today 
quoting unidentified sources close to the irancontra inquiry 
the newspaper says the administration feared that any discussion of 
the documents in court might disrupt us intelligence in several 
countries 
one source said some of the withheld documents were declassified 
during congressional investigations of the irancontra affair but 
were later reclassified in an effort to limit discussion of the 
incidents they describe the herald said 
special prosecutor lawrence walsh asked that the two major 
charges against north be dismissed after the reagan administration 
refused to allow certain documents to be used in norths trial us 
district judge gerhard gesell is expected to act on walshs request 
this week 
the newspaper said some of its sources are closely tied to 
norths defense team while others either worked closely with north 
in the past or participated in the 1987 congressional investigation 
into the irancontra affair 
one of the sources is a senior administration official who 
advises the state department and the white house on central american 
security policy the newspaper said 
countries listed in the documents the sources said include 
costa rica el salvador and venezuela where respectively 
norths resupply network aiding the nicaraguan contra rebels built 
an airstrip controlled part of an air base and attempted to buy 
military aircraft 
norths activities in these countries were central to walshs 
legal strategy to show that the former national security council 
aide conspired to defraud the united states and steal government 
property by using the profits from arms sales to iran to purchase 
supplies for the contras 
those are the charges walsh says he must withdraw 
in each case the sources said walsh has documentary evidence 
including invoices receipts and other legal papers showing 
transactions involving iran arms sales profits and contra supplies

an enraged nikita khrushchev instructed soviet 
ships to ignore president kennedys naval blockade during the cuban 
missile crisis but the order was reversed just hours before an 
inevitable confrontation according to a new book 
james g blight and david a welch of harvard universitys john 
f kennedy school of government say that if this order had held 
war between the superpowers would probably have commenced at sea 
shortly after 10 oclock on wednesday morning oct 24 1962 
several hundred miles off the coast of cuba 
anastas mikoyan then soviet first deputy premier was the 
catalyst for the reversal of khrushchevs order according to the 
authors mikoyan preempted khrushchevs order to run the blockade 
and ordered soviet ships to stop just short of the quarantine 
line they say 
but blight and welch said at a news conference wednesday that it 
remains unclear whether mikoyan reversed or circumvented the 
decision on his own or convinced khrushchev of its perils welch 
said the order was reversed just hours before soviet ships reached 
us forces 
the book on the brink americans and soviets reexamine the 
cuban missile crisis is based largely on two 1987 conferences 
sponsored by harvard one that featured top kennedy advisers and 
us scholars and a second in which three soviets joined the 
americans 
the book will serve as a backdrop for a third conference 
scheduled for jan 2729 in moscow featuring for the first time 
soviet american and cuban officials who participated in the crisis 
which was triggered when soviet troops began installing missiles in 
cuba capable of reaching the united states 
secret correspondence between kennedy and khrushchev concerning 
the missile crisis is expected to be released at the conference 
according to harvard officials 
the book said khrushchevs order to ignore the blockade was 
disclosed in a largely unknown work by dissident soviet historian 
roy medvedev the harvard authors said much of the information has 
been confirmed independently by mikoyans son sergo who was an 
aide to his father during the crisis 
the authors also conclude that the missiles in cuba probably did 
not have warheads their theory that the warheads were blocked by 
the quarantine is at odds with a recent disclosure by aleksander 
alekseev the former ambassador to cuba who said in a recent soviet 
magazine that 42 mediumrange missiles were fully operational 
but the authors suggested that alekseev along with others in the 
soviet diplomatic corps were not receiving accurate information 
from moscow about the missiles

it was not the type of ceremonial

day either 
gov kay orr made a special trip from her secondfloor office 
wednesday to call sen jim mcfarland from an education committee and 
present him with a can opener bedecked with a big ribbon in case 
you ever find yourself locked in the can again 
mcfarland somehow managed to break a deadbolt lock on the door 
of a small bathroom on the capitols eighth floor last week he was 
there for nearly an hour before maintenance workers got clearance to 
take the door apart and let him out 
i heard that you had had some difficulty and thought this might 
be of some value to you if this unfortunate type of thing happens 
again mrs orr said 
governor i accept this in the spirit in which it is given and

skiers and operators of fashionable resorts 
in the alps and dolomites are facing a severe dry spell that has 
left northern italy snowless and caused sharp losses to the 
multimilliondollar ski industry 
but in the long term the dryness may be most damaging to farmers 
in the plains their national association claimed this week that 
this years harvests of wheat and barley are being jeopardized by 
the lack of moisture 
it also said an expected lowering in river levels may hurt rice 
farming in the po valley this spring 
if it does not snow and a lot within this month we will have 
no water to submerge 150000 hectares 370500 acres of rice 
said bruno pusterla a top official of the italian agricultural 
confederation in the meantime drought is already causing damage 
to seedlings 
the latest snowfall on the italian side of the alps date back to 
early december when an average of eight inches of fresh snow elated 
owners of hotels and ski lifts not a single drop of rain or a flake 
of snow has since been spotted in northern italy 
dozens of tourists upset by the lack of snow and poor 
accommodations protested in salice dulzio near the french border 
forcing local authorities to negotiate repayment of a share of their 
prepaid vacations 
unusually high temperatures prevented the use of snowmakers 
considered a good defense in case of late winter snowfalls in 
resorts such as sestriere courmayeur bormio madonna di campiglio 
and selva val gardena resorts had spent several million dollars to 
install batteries of snowmaking equipment on alpine slopes 
snow bulletins issued weekly by tourist offices list an 
increasing number of closed ski lifts and cable cars the highest 
alpine ski tracks above 6000 feet report no more than 12 to 16 
inches 
the few resorts with favorable ski conditions because of their 
shady positions were invaded by thousands of chrismas holiday skiers 
quickly spoiling their slopes 
the unusual high pressure over northern italy also touched off 
several consecutive days of thick fog in the plains which closed 
airports hampered road traffic and caused pileups on highways 
we can only hope that snow comes soon and plentifully to 
salvage a tourist season already compromised says caterina 
prossliner who runs a luxury hotel in val badia near the austrian 
border 
some international crosscountry races scheduled in northern 
italy in midjanuary were canceled for lack of snow while world cup 
races early in december were held with some difficulty on artificial 
snow 
several of the early races of the competition france austria and 
switzerland were rescheduled last month however the three 
neighboring alpine countries have had some recent snowfalls of 14 to 
40 inches 
some members of the environmentalist green party claim a steady 
rise in winter temperatures and the frequent dry spells are the 
result of the greenhouse effect or climactic warming resulting 
from humankinds burning of fossil fuels 
however franca chlistovsky who heads the brera metereologic 
institute in milan said this winters dry spell was not exceptional 
and several worse years have been registered since 1950 
people have a slippery memory certainly winter has begun later 
than usual in some recent years but it lasted longer she

desire under the elms a new opera based on 
eugene oneills play of the same name is blessed with a story 
perfect for opera full of rivalry greed sex and violence 
soprano judy kaye who won a tony on broadway last year stars in 
the new york opera repertory theater production and is splendid in 
the pivotal role of abbie but the music composed by edward thomas 
doesnt have all the power it needs 
the opera had its first staged presentation wednesday at the city 
center 
operas these days are melodic minimalist or have a jagged vocal 
line that doesnt sound like a melody to most listeners desire 
under the elms is of the latter kind 
thats fine and this opera sounds good much of the time but in 
arias expressing emotion for instance it often sounds bland 
a lullaby is a departure from the rest of the music but when a 
very dramatic moment comes that music should also be a departure 
hitting some heights in desire under the elms the drama is 
principally carried by the situation and the words being sung 
abbie marries elderly ephraim cabot bass nicholas solomon 
seduces his son eben tenor james schwisow and has a baby abbie 
ephraim and eben each want total ownership of the farm on which they 
live so the stew of sex love and deception is further stirred by 
mistrust of love based on what any one might do to get the farm 
the orchestral scoring isnt heavy so most of the words could be 
understood the mens voices were good but not big an appraisal 
which extends to robert paul heimann and william livingston as two 
older sons who leave home before abbie arrives miss kayes voice 
most nearly filled the house 
the new york opera repertory theater was founded in 1977 by leigh 
gibbs gore who conducted the opera it is dedicated to creation and 
performance of opera and new music theater 
composer thomas is a native of chisholm minn joe masteroff who 
wrote the book for broadways she loves me and cabaret is 
making his debut as a librettist 
desire under the elms was done in a workshop at the oneill 
theater centers national music theater conference in its first 
year 1978 it also has had concert performances the set for this 
first staged presentation was a cutaway twostory house by michael 
anania gregg barnes designed costumes and david gately directed 
it will be performed again on friday and sunday

chancellor helmut kohl says he no 
longer can rule out the possibility charges may be brought against 
west germany companies reported to have helped libya build a 
suspected chemical weapons factory 
west german officials have for weeks denied discovering any 
evidence supporting us charges that west german firms helped build 
the plant in rabta 40 miles south of tripoli 
but several west german news reports on wednesday said west 
germany companies played a major role in supplying equipment for and 
assisting in the construction of the plant which libyan leader col 
moammar gadhafi contends is not a chemical weapons but a 
pharmaceutical plant 
kohl told a news conference that a team of west german experts 
left for washington wednesday to discuss the us allegations in 
more detail 
asked about the new accusations that west german companies were 
involved in the rabta plant he said all evidence will be 
investigated thoroughly i cannot exclude that there may be some 
evidence that could stand up in court 
but the west german leader emphasized that his government must 
have such evidence before action is taken 
the government cannot ground its action on speculation kohl 
said 
federal officials already have confirmed that a criminal 
investigation has begun against a nowdefunct frankfurt firm ibi 
engineering and that investigators had seized company documents 
but they told the associated press that no proof had been yet 
found that west german companies were involved in the libyan plant 
however in its evening news report wednesday the ard television 
network showed what it said were documents seized by customs 
officials that allegedly show transactions between the 
imhausenchemie company and libya 
the names of ibi and imhausen could be read on some of the 
documents but the exact nature of the papers was not clear 
stern magazine reported in todays editions that ibi was 
deeply involved in the libyan plant along with imhausenchemie of 
lahr and the hamburgbased pen tsao medical material company 
imhausenchemie and pen tsao were cleared in an initial audit 
last week 
all three companies have been named by us officials in their 
accusations delivered privately to bonn authorities that west 
german firms aided libya in building the plant 
a finance ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
confirmed wednesday that ibi was now under investigation 
he said the west german customs service which is conducting the 
investigation had seized ibi documents as part of the probe 
stern magazine said the documents had been in the possession of 
harry b meyer of frankfurt which it identified as a tax adviser to 
ibi owner ihsan barbouti an iraqi national 
the investigators are looking into whether ibi shipped goods 
to libya and whether they required an export permit said the 
official 
he said a belgian transport company crosslink of antwerp was 
being probed by belgian officials and that bonn had asked 
authorities in the neighboring country to assist in the ibi 
investigation 
stern said many of ibis deliveries were carried out by an 
unidentified shipper in antwerp it named no sources in its report 
but said the material was based on official documents and 
firstperson reports 
the hamburgbased magazine claimed ibi to a large extent 
organized the total project in the libyan desert 
stern said federal authorities have confiscated documents showing 
that ibi imhausenchemie and pen tsao were involved in the 
libyan project 
it said imhausen delivered everything that is needed to build a 
chemical plant to ibi 
the magazine alleged that some of the materials were shipped by 
pen tsao under bills of lading to hong kong but actually delivered 
to libya 
libya claims its new plant will produce pharmaceuticals not 
poison gas or other biological weapons the united states claims it 
has evidence to the contrary and those claims have been supported 
by canada the netherlands and britain which says it has 
independent confirmation 
the us preoccupation with the rabta plant led gadhafi to accuse 
the united states of planning an air strike to knock it out 
on jan 4 two us f14 jet fighters shot down two libyan 
warplanes over the mediterranean about 600 miles from the plant 
washington claimed the downings were provoked by aggressive and 
threatening actions by armed libyan aircraft while libya said its 
jets were unarmed and on a reconaissance flight over international 
waters

an astronomer who spotted a strange circle on a 
satellite photo of czechoslovakia believes the object is a 
200milewide crater thats too big to identify on earth 
boston universitys michael d papagiannis said he believes the 
crater was created 100 million years ago when a 50milewide 
meteorite slammed into the earth 
the impact would be the equivalent of 1 trillion hiroshima 
bombs he said wednesday at the american astronomical societys 
annual meeting 
papagiannis noticed it on a satellite photo taken and he has 
since seen it on other pictures from space 
he has named it the praha basin because the city of praha or 
prague is near its center the crater if it truly is that covers 
most of western czechoslovakia it is roughly bounded by ostined 
lesny and liberec in czechoslovakia and gmund in austria 
papagiannis said the purported crater is simply too big to be 
noticed by people on earth

schoolapproved tobaccospitting contest sought to recapture the 
days of the old west but they also violated state and local 
regulations officials say 
six students at odessa high school in this west texas city took 
part in the afterschool event tuesday as vice principal vance 
horsley and economics teacher bill rutherford cheered from the 
sidelines 
the texas education code and school district policy prohibit use 
of tobacco products at schoolsponsored events 
state schools superintendent hugh hayes said wednesday he was 
disappointed to hear about the contest and would investigate 
principal raymond starnes said he would talk to the teacher and 
administrator who staged the contest which was part of western week 
celebrations 
rutherford who is sponsor for the school student council said 
he obtained approval for the contest from horsley and was aware of 
district policy banning tobacco use on school property 
we sat around and tried to think of pastime activities 
associated with the old west rutherford said we were going to 
do the cow patty bingo but we found out from an attorney that 
thats considered gambling so we didnt do it 
i just thought it was unusual circumstances and wouldnt hurt 
anybody horsley said i know its a violation i was wrong 
but i hate to see something big made out of something like that 
starnes said he was aware of the contest but said rutherford had

more savings and loans failed in 1988 than in 
any year since the depression this year taxpayers may be asked to 
pick up the cost of rescuing the industry and the price could run 
into the billions of dollars 
here are answers to some commonly asked questions about the 
problem 
q how are depositors savings protected 
a the first line of defense when an institution fails is a 
government insurance fund the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp the fslic 
the ultimate backing if the fund runs out of money is the 
taxpayer on several occasions congress most recently in 1987 has 
reaffirmed that the full faith and credit of the federal government 
stands behind the deposits 
q does that mean the government would pay the depositors if the 
sampl went out of business 
a yes as long as the sampl has federal insurance 
in most cases the insurance fund tries to avoid direct depositor 
payoffs instead the government rescues the institution by 
providing new owners with a mixture of cash promissory notes and 
other guarantees to wipe out the old losses 
the new owners also invest some of their own money and the 
institution stays open usually under a new name the old managers 
lose their jobs the stockholders lose their investment but 
depositors are protected 
q how does the fslic work 
a the fslic guarantees deposit accounts up to 100000 in nearly 
3000 sampls similarly government insurance also protects savers in 
commercial banks through the federal deposit insurance corp fdic 
while the national credit union administration ncua stands behind 
credit unions 
q where do the insurance funds get their money 
a from the institutions whose deposits they insure sampls for 
instance pay a premium of 21 cents a year for every 100 in 
deposits the fslic also has been raising money by selling 30year 
bonds which will be paid off by the premiums from the industry 
and it sells property from failed institutions to recover some of 
its costs 
q if sampls fund the insurance plan why do people say the public 
will end up paying 
a the reagan administration has recently acknowledged that 
income from the industry wont be enough to cover savings accounts 
in failed sampls and therefore the public will have to bear much of 
the cost industry trade groups say healthy institutions will start 
going under if theyre forced to pay higher premiums 
q how would the public pay 
a this is not clear the treasury department is working on a 
plan for presidentelect bush private analysts believe that in some 
manner tax money will be needed 
the solution could involve a direct appropriation of taxpayer 
funds or congress could authorize regulators to borrow what they 
need with the understanding that taxpayer funds will be used to pay 
the interest or congress could impose fees on members of the 
public such as home buyers who benefit from the sampl system 
q what is the controversy about the 1988 bailouts 
keeping a moneylosing institution alive means it could continue 
to lose money under new owners eventually making another rescue 
necessary 
the government protects the new owners from losing money on loans 
made by the previous owners critics think the new owners ought to 
share more of the risk as an incentive to manage the loan portfolio 
wisely 
also members of congress are angry because in some cases private 
buyers are reaping tax breaks from the deals that are worth more 
than they are paying to take possession of failed institutions they 
say regulators ought to have been able to get more cash from the 
buyers in exchange for the tax benefits 
q why do regulators think the bailout approach will ultimately 
save money for the taxpayers 
a if the government simply shuts down an institution it has to 
spend enormous amounts immediately to pay off depositors more 
money than the regulators have over a period of years it then 
hopes to get back some of it by selling loans and repossessed 
property from the failed sampl 
by rescuing an institution the government pays only for the 
loss not for the entire amount of insured deposits and it gets to 
spread out the cost typically for as long as 10 years 
also most institutions have a certain value as a going concern 
such as a loyal customer base that would be destroyed if they were 
liquidated in 1988 new sampl owners pumped 3 billion into the 
rescued institutions in exchange for this value 
in december regulators resolved the cases of 75 sampls at an 
estimated cost of 155 billion to the insurance fund and 4 billion 
in tax breaks the ultimate cost of liquidating those sampls would 
have been 228 billion however and the insurance fund would have 
had to immediately come up with 47 billion in upfront cash 
q how did we get in this fix in the first place 
a inflation and high interest rates in the 1970s and early 1980s 
put most sampls in a bind they were forced to pay more to attract 
deposits than they were earning on longterm mortgages already on 
their books 
one of the solutions was to allow savings and loans to expand 
beyond traditional mortgage lending and invest in commercial real 
estate and other projects which earn higher rates of return and 
require only a shortterm commitment by the sampl 
the new rules attracted a new class of sampl owner now called 
highfliers they were particularly prevalent in states with 
more liberal sampl rules such as texas california and florida 
unfortunately the new investments made by highfliers were 
riskier when the texas economy collapsed because of plummeting oil 
prices borrowers stopped making payments and much of the commercial 
real estate serving as collateral was worth only a fraction of its 
previous value 
at the same time sampls were entering unfamiliar territory the 
reagan administration was cutting back on its force of examiners it 
was only in 1985 when regulators arranged to have the examination 
force taken off budget that sampls began to be more closely 
supervised 
in some cases outright fraud contributed to the losses a justice 
departmentled task force operating in texas since 1987 has 
obtained indictments and convictions of sampl managers 
also throughout the 1980s congress at the urging of industry 
lobby groups consistently refused to provide regulators with enough 
money to shut down all failed institutions the institutions stayed 
open and lost even more money congress also directed regulators to 
forbear from taking action against sampls in economically 
distressed areas such as texas

an antichemical weapons declaration intentionally 
crafted in diluted form to satisfy its 149 signatory nations should 
help accelerate talks on a ban of toxic arms officials say 
but the united states and soviet union the only two countries 
that admit they possess chemical arms said wednesday that the 
document produced by the fiveday conference had fallen short of 
their expectations 
the chief us delegate william f burns said washington would 
have preferred that explicit language be put into the declaration to 
include sanctions against users of poison gas nerve gas and other 
toxic chemical arms 
if the united states had written this statement which we did 
not it might have been stronger this is a consensus document 
said burns who heads the us arms control and disarmament agency 
iran a victim of poison gas in its eightyear war with iraq was 
among several states that voiced reservations after the 
declarations unanimous endorsement 
iraqs use of chemical weapons against iran and iraqs kurdish 
minority graphic pictures of peasants killed in iranian villages 
heightened concerns last year provided a somber backdrop for the 
conference which was formally proposed by president reagan at the 
united nations in september 
iran succeeded in getting a reference to recent violations of 
the protocol in the declaration but its delegation said it had 
hoped for a categorical condemnation of past use of toxic weapons 
host france said the conference would give life to languishing 
negotiations in geneva seeking a verifiable ban on chemical arms 
the nonbinding declaration reaffirms the 1925 geneva protocol 
which prohibits the use of chemical weapons and urges negotiators 
in geneva to redouble efforts to ban the use production and 
stocking of chemical arms 
the sixpoint declaration affirms the un role in investigating 
chemical weapons use and called for a strenthening of existing 
procedures at the united nations in dealing with such use a 
reference to enacting sanctions 
signers condemned the use of chemical arms pledging not to use 
them 
unanimous approval of the final declaration was tantamount to 
saying the whole international community has taken a posture 
against chemical weapons said foreign minister roland dumas of 
france who presided over the conference 
this unanimity will accelerate work underway in geneva 
he said 
but the breadth of the declaration aimed at appeasing all 
parties allowed for a broad interpretation that clearly reflected 
five days of haggling 
max friedersdorf us arms negotiator in geneva said it was 
hard to quantify how the declaration could speed up negotiations 
toward a convention i think it will have an impact on nations 
its bound to strengthen world opinion on the convention 
friedersdorf said 
until the end of events recently there was very little 
notice given to what was going on in geneva in fact i think the 
whole world thought the dreaded scourge of chemical weapons was gone 
forever since world war i 
the united states and other western nations that have nuclear 
arms succeeded in blocking efforts led by arab states to explicitly 
link the banning of chemical and nuclear weapons 
arab nations said they wanted to reserve the right to possess 
chemical weapons to counter what they claim is a nuclear threat from 
israel 
however hours before the conference closed iraqi vice premier 
tariq aziz announced that arab states would concede their demand to 
link nuclear and chemical weapons bans in order to get a consensus 
forty delegations have been holding talks in geneva on banning 
chemical weapons since the early 1980s but have been stymied by 
ways to verify a ban on chemical and biological weapons which 
include odorless colorless gases made in plants that can be 
camoflaged on short notice and laboratorymade toxins derived from 
fungi 
an estimated 20 nations currently have chemical weapons 
capabilities

the supreme court is examining the legal 
significance of imposing capital punishment on a convicted murderer 
described as having the mind of a child 
the justices heard 60 minutes of arguments wednesday on whether 
they will allow the execution of johnny paul penry 32 a convicted 
rapistmurderer sentenced to die in texas the court is expected to 
announce its decision in july 
penry is said to have the mental capacity of a 7yearold and the 
social development of a 9yearold 
assistant attorney general charles a palmer of texas argued that 
executing penry would not violate the constitutions ban against 
cruel and inhuman punishment 
he knew what he was doing palmer said penry raped pamela 
moseley carpenter on oct 15 1979 in livingston texas then 
stabbed her to death she was 22 
palmer recited evidence that penry killed the woman to prevent 
her from identifying him 
ms carpenters brother retired national football league 
placekicker mark moseley was in the courtroom wednesday and told 
reporters afterward its been nine years of hell for myself and 
my family 
he said its not something anyone should have to go through 
and i feel that if anything good can come out of it that may be we 
can render a decision that will make it not happen to someone else 
some justices expressed doubts that describing someone as having 
the mental capacity of a child has much relevance 
what does it mean to have the mental age of 9 asked justice 
antonin scalia 
palmer said witnesses for penry testified he functioned mentally 
like a 7yearold and socially like a 9yearold 
beyond that i can not help the court palmer said 
if its something we dont understand why allow such 
evidence to be introduced asked justice anthony m kennedy 
curtis c mason a lawyer representing penry spent little time 
arguing that all retarded murderers should be spared instead mason 
challenged the texas death penalty law on narrower grounds 
mason said the law prevented the jury from giving full 
consideration to evidence in penrys favor when it determined what 
sentence to impose 
penry was abused by his parents attended school only for a few 
days in the first grade and was in and out of mental hospitals while 
growing up near houston 
but mason said the texas law would let the jury conclude penry 
is not fully responsible for the way he is today and still vote 
to execute him 
he argued the jury only was permitted to consider whether 
evidence of penrys retardation and mistreatment showed that penry 
had acted deliberately with the reasonable expectation that death 
would result 
while the high court might be reluctant to ban the death penalty 
for all retarded killers it still could overturn the texas capital 
punishment law on the narrower grounds cited by mason 
justice sandra day oconnor whose vote could be pivotal in the 
case suggested to palmer that the texas law gives convicted 
murderers limited hope of winning reprieve from the death penalty 
she questioned whether the state law allows a juror to vote for 
life in prison even if the juror believed the defendant acted with 
diminished moral culpability because of his background 
palmer replied the jury can say my god this boys been 
treated so badly he didnt act deliberately but he acknowledged 
the jury is barred from weighing such mitigating evidence to reject 
the death penalty 
the case has attracted considerable attention because of its 
potential impact for all retarded killers 
the clearinghouse on georgia prisons and jails a group opposed 
to capital punishment estimates that from 12 percent to 20 percent 
of the more than 2100 inmates on death rows nationwide function at 
belowaverage intelligence 
ms carpenter was stabbed repeatedly in the chest with a pair of 
scissors she was using to make a halloween costume for her niece 
she provided a description of her assailant before she died 
penry at the time was a parttime delivery man for a local 
appliance store he recently had been paroled from prison where he 
had been sentenced on a rape conviction 
the court also is considering this year whether the death penalty 
should be banned for anyone who commits murder while under 18 
in other action wednesday the court 
gave states sweeping power to protect consumers by barring 
utilities from passing on even prudent costs of abandoned nuclear 
power plants the justices voting 81 barred two pennsylvania 
utilities from billing electricity customers for nearly 50 million 
invested in four abandoned plants

here is the prepared text of president reagans 
farewell address to the nation wednesday night 
my fellow americans this is the 34th time ill speak to you from 
the oval office and the last 
we have been together eight years now and soon it will be time 
for me to go but before i do i wanted to share some thoughts some 
of which i have been saving for a long time 
it has been the honor of my life to be your president so many of 
you have written the past few weeks to say thanks but i could say 
as much to you nancy and i are grateful for the opportunity you 
gave us to serve 
one of the things about the presidency is that youre always 
somewhat apart you spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car 
someone else is driving and seeing the people through tinted glass 
the parents holding up a child and the wave you saw too late and 
couldnt return and so many times i wanted to stop and reach out 
from behind the glass and connect and maybe i can do a little of 
that tonight 
people ask how i feel about leaving and the fact is parting is 
such sweet sorrow the sweet part is california and the ranch 
and freedom the sorrow the goodbyes of course and leaving this 
beautiful place 
you know down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the 
part of the white house where the president and his family live 
there are a few favorite windows i have up there that i like to 
stand and look out of early in the morning the view is over the 
grounds here to the washington monument and then the mall and the 
jefferson memorial but on mornings when the humidity is low you 
can see past the jefferson to the river the potomac and the 
virginia shore someone said thats the view lincoln had when he saw 
the smoke rising from the battle of bull run i see more prosaic 
things the grass on the banks the morning traffic as people make 
their way to work now and then a sailboat on the river 
i have been thinking a bit at that window ive been reflecting 
on what the past eight years have meant and mean and the image 
that comes to mind like a refrain is a nautical one a small story 
about a big ship and a refugee and a sailor 
it was back in the early 80s at the height of the boat people 
and the sailor was hard at work on the carrier midway which was 
patrolling the south china sea the sailor like most american 
servicemen was young smart and fiercely observant the crew spied 
on the horizon a leaky little boat and crammed inside were 
refugees from indochina hoping to get to america the midway sent a 
small launch to bring them to the ship and safety as the refugees 
made their way through the choppy seas one spied the sailor on 
deck and stood up and called out to him he yelled hello 
american sailor hello freedom man

a small moment with a big meaning a moment the sailor who wrote 
it in a letter couldnt get out of his mind and when i saw it 
neither could i 
because thats what it was to be an american in the 1980s we 
stood again for freedom i know we always have but in the past few 
years the world again and in a way we ourselves rediscovered 
it 
it has been quite a journey this decade and we held together 
through some stormy seas and at the end together we are reaching 
our destination 
the fact is from grenada to the washington and moscow summits 
from the recession of 81 and 82 to the expansion that began in 
late 82 and continues to this day weve made a difference 
the way i see it there were two great triumphs two things that 
im proudest of one is the economic recovery in which the people 
of america created and filled 19 million new jobs the other is 
the recovery of our morale america is respected again in the world 
and looked to for leadership 
something that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of 
this it was back in 1981 and i was attending my first big economic 
summit which was held that year in canada the meeting place 
rotates among the member countries the opening meeting was a formal 
dinner for the heads of government of the seven industrialized 
nations i sat there like the new kid in school and listened and it 
was all francois this and helmut that they dropped titles and spoke 
to one another on a firstname basis at one point i sort of leaned 
in and said my names ron 
in that same year we began the actions we felt would ignite an 
economic comeback cut taxes and regulation started to cut 
spending soon the recovery began 
two years later another economic summit with pretty much the 
same cast at the big opening meeting we all got together and all 
of a sudden just for a moment i saw that everyone was looking at me 
then one of them broke the silence tell us about the american 
miracle he said 
back in 1980 when i was running for president it was all so 
different some pundits said our programs would result in 
catastrophe our views on foreign affairs would cause war our plans 
for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about 
economic collapse i even remember one highly respected economist 
saying back in 1982 that the engines of economic growth have 
shut down here and across the globe and they are likely to stay that 
way for years to come 
well he and the other opinion leaders were wrong the 
fact is what they called radical was really right what 
they called dangerous was just desperately needed 
and in all that time i won a nickname the great 
communicator but i never thought it was my style or the words i 
used that made a difference it was the content i wasnt a great 
communicator but i communicate great things and they didnt spring 
full blown from my brow they came from the heart of a great nation 
from our experience our wisdom and our belief in the principles 
that have guided us for two centuries

they called it the reagan revolution and ill accept that but 
for me it always seemed more like the great rediscovery a 
rediscovery of our values and our common sense 
common sense told us that when you put a big tax on something 
the people will produce less of it so we cut the peoples tax rates 
and the people produced more than ever before the economy bloomed 
like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and 
stronger our economic program brought about the longest peacetime 
expansion in our history real family income up the poverty rate 
down entrepreneurship booming and an explosion in research and new 
technology we are exporting more than ever because american 
industry became more competitive and at the same time we summoned 
the national will to knock down protectionist walls abroad instead 
of erecting them at home 
common sense also told us that to preserve the peace wed have to 
become strong again after years of weakness and confusion so we 
rebuilt our defenses and this new year we toasted the new 
peacefulness around the globe not only have the superpowers 
actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons and 
hope for even more progress is bright but the regional conflicts 
that rack the globe are also beginning to cease the persian gulf is 
no longer a war zone the soviets are leaving afghanistan the 
vietnamese are preparing to pull out of cambodia and an 
americanmediated accord will soon send 50000 cuban troops home 
from angola 
the lesson of all this was of course that because we are a 
great nation our challenges seem complex it will always be this 
way but as long as we remember our first principles and believe in 
ourselves the future will always be ours 
and something else we learned once you begin a great movement 
theres no telling where it will end we meant to change a nation 
and instead we changed a world 
countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free 
speech and turning away from the ideologies of the past for them 
the great rediscovery of the 1980s has been that lo and behold the 
moral way of government is the practical way of government 
democracy the profoundly good is also the profoundly productive 
when youve got to the point where you can celebrate the 
anniversaries of your 39th birthday you can sit back sometimes 
review your life and see it flowing before you for me there was a 
fork in the river and it was right in the middle of my life 
i never meant to go into politics it wasnt my intention when i 
was young but i was raised to believe you had to pay your way for 
the blessings bestowed on you i was happy with my career in the 
entertainment world but i ultimately went into politics because i 
wanted to protect something precious 
ours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that 
truly reversed the course of government and with three little 
words we the people 
we the people tell the government what to do it doesnt tell 
us we the people are the driver the government is the car 
and we decide where it should go and by what route and how fast 
almost all the worlds consitutions are documents in which 
governments tell the people what their privileges are our 
constitution is a document in which we the people tell the 
government what it is allowed to do we the people are free 
this belief has been the underlying basis for everything i have 
tried to do these past eight years 
but back in the 1960s when i began it seemed to me that we had 
begun reversing the order of things that through more and more 
rules and regulations and confiscatory taxes the government was 
taking more of our money more of our options and more of our 
freedom i went into politics in part to put up my hand and say 
stop i was a citizen politician and it seemed the right thing 
for a citizen to do

i think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping and i hope 
we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless 
government is limited theres a clear cause and effect here that is 
as neat and predictable as a law of physics as government expands 
liberty contracts 
nothing is less free than pure communism and yet we have the 
past few years forged a satsifying new closeness with the soviet 
union ive been asked if this isnt a gamble and my answer is no 
because were basing our actions not on words but deeds 
the detente of the 1970s was based not on actions but promises 
theyd promise to treat their own people and the people of the world 
better but the gulag was still the gulag and the state was still 
expansionist and they still waged proxy wars in africa asia and 
latin america 
this time so far its different president gorbachev has 
brought about some internal democratic reforms and begun the 
withdrawal from afghanistan he has also freed prisoners whose names 
ive given him every time weve met 
but life has a way of reminding you of big things through small 
incidents once during the heady days of the moscow summit nancy 
and i decided to break off from the entourage one afternoon to visit 
the shops on arbat street a little street just off moscows main 
shopping area 
even though our visit was a surprise every russian there 
immediately recognized us and called out our names and reached for 
our hands we were just about swept away by the warmth you could 
almost feel the possibilities in all that joy but within seconds a 
kgb detail pushed their way toward us and began pushing and shoving 
the people in the crowd it was an interesting moment it reminded 
me that while the man on the street in the soviet union yearns for 
peace the government is communist those who run it are communists 
and that means we and they view such issues as freedom and human 
rights very differently 
we must keep up our guard but we must also continue to work 
together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust 
my view is that president gorbachev is different from previous 
soviet leaders i think he knows some of the things wrong with his 
society and is trying to fix them we wish him well and well 
continue to work to make sure that the soviet union that eventually 
emerges from this process is a less threatening one 
what it all boils down to is this i want the new closeness to 
continue and it will as long as we make it clear that we will 
continue to act in a certain way as long as they continue to act in 
a helpful manner if and when they dont at first pull your 
punches if they persist pull the plug 
its still trust but verify 
its still play but cut the cards 
its still watch closely and dont be afraid to see what you 
see

ive been asked if i have any regrets i do 
the deficit is one ive been talking a great deal about that 
lately but tonight isnt for arguments and im going to hold my 
tongue 
but an observation ive had my share of victories in the 
congress but what few people noticed is that i never won anything 
you didnt win for me they never saw my troops they never saw 
reagans regiments the american people you won every battle with 
every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action 
well action is still needed if were to finish the job 
reagans regiments will have to become the bush brigades soon hell 
be the chief and hell need you every bit as much as i did 
finally there is a great tradition of warnings in presidential 
farewells and ive got one thats been on my mind for some time 
but oddly enough it starts with one of the things im proudest of 
the past eight years the resurgence of national pride that i called 
the new patriotism this national feeling is good but it wont 
count for much and it wont last unless its grounded in 
thoughtfulness and knowledge 
an informed patriotism is what we want and are we doing a good 
enough job teaching our children what america is and what she 
represents in the long history of the world 
those of us who are over 35 or so years of age grew up in a 
different america we were taught very directly what it means to 
be an american and we absorbed almost in the air a love of country 
and an appreciation of its institutions if you didnt get these 
things from your family you got them from the neighborhood from the 
father down the street who fought in korea or the family who lost 
someone at anzio or you could get a sense of patriotism from 
school and if all else failed you could get a sense of patriotism 
from the popular culture the movies celebrated democratic values 
and implicitly reinforced the idea that america was special tv was 
like that too through the mid60s 
but now were about to enter the 90s and some things have 
changed younger parents arent sure that an unambivalent 
appreciation of america is the right thing to teach modern children 
and as for those who create the popular culture wellgrounded 
patriotism is no longer in style 
our spirit is back but we havent reinstitutionalized it weve 
got to do a better job of getting across that america is freedom 
freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of enterprise and 
freedom is special and rare its fragile it needs protection 
weve got to teach history based not on whats in fashion but 
whats important why the pilgrims came here who jimmy doolittle 
was and what those 30 seconds over tokyo meant you know four 
years ago on the 40th anniversary of dday i read a letter from a 
young woman writing to her late father whod fought on omaha beach 
her name is lisa zanatta henn and she said we will always 
remember we will never forget what the boys of normandy did well 
lets help her keep her word

if we forget what we did we wont know who we are i am warning 
of an eradication of the american memory that could result 
ultimately in an erosion of the american spirit 
lets start with some basics more attention to american history 
and a greater emphasis on civic ritual and let me offer lesson no 
1 about america all great change in america begins at the dinner 
table so tomorrow night in the kitchen i hope the talking begins 
and children if your parents havent been teaching you what it 
means to be an american let em know and nail em on it that would 
be a very american thing to do 
and thats about all i have to say tonight except for one thing 
the past few days when ive been at that window upstairs ive 
thought a bit of the shining city upon a hill the phrase comes 
from john winthrop who wrote it to describe the america he 
imagined what he imagined was important because he was an early 
pilgrim an early freedom man he journeyed here on what today 
wed call a little wooden boat and like the other pilgrims he was 
looking for a home that would be free 
ive spoken of the shining city all my political life but i 
dont know if i ever quite communicated what i saw when i said it 
but in my mind it was a tall proud city built on rocks stronger than 
oceans windswept godblessed and teeming with people of all 
kinds living in harmony and peace a city with free ports that 
hummed with commerce and creativity and if there had to be city 
walls the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with 
the will and the heart to get here 
thats how i saw it and see it still 
and how stands the city on this winter night more prosperous 
more secure and happier than it was eight years ago but more than 
that after 200 years two centuries she still stands strong and 
true on the granite ridge and her glow has held steady no matter 
what storm and shes still a beacon still a magnet for all who 
must have freedom for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who 
are hurtling through the darkness toward home 
weve done our part and as i walk off into the city streets 
a final word to the men and women of the reagan revolution the men 
and women across america who for eight years did the work that 
brought america back 
my friends we did it we werent just marking time we made a 
difference we made the city stronger we made the city freer and 
we left her in good hands

presidentelect bush and other politicians 
should make adult literacy a national priority and commit up to 550 
million for promoting it says a report released today by a 
nonpartisan research institute 
the primary need is for leadership says the report called 
jump start the federal role in adult literacy and issued by the 
southport institute for policy analysis 
forrest chisman author of the study said he is encouraged by 
presidentelect bushs stated interest in being an education 
president and his wife barbaras longtime activism in literacy 
chisman director of southports project on adult literacy 
recommended new federal spending of 550 million but said even less 
would permit a quantum leap forward 
an estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of us adults some 20 
million to 30 million people lack basic literacy skills 
many are in the work force chisman contends this aspect of the 
literacy problem has the greatest immediate economic importance and 
should receive more attention 
most public and private programs are not available to people 
who are on the job he wrote almost all federal resources are 
targeted on the unemployed or other disadvantaged groups 
in an accompanying statement mrs bush said she hoped the report 
would lead to a more unified coherent approach to this major 
national concern 
among chismans recommendations 
a sixmonth task force to set literacy goals and means of 
achieving them and a cabinet council on adult literacy to 
coordinate federal efforts 
passage of an adult basic skills act to set up a national center 
for adult literacy establish matching grants for state and local 
programs and create a training program for adult literacy workers 
authorization of basic skills training for the employed under 
the job training partnership act

a 73yearold cancer patient says he 
decided to go to prison as a matter of principle rather than accept 
a solution to a decadeold dispute over a sewer hookup that would 
have cost him nothing 
im doing this to show my rights to america wilbert siegel 
a retired metal worker with rectal cancer said wednesday as he was 
taken from his modest james island home near here to begin a 
sixmonth sentence for contempt of court 
a large american flag decorated siegels porch and yellow ribbons 
adorned pine trees in his yard as he tearfully kissed his wife 
hattie goodbye 
he was then taken to lieber correctional institution in 
ridgeville 
im not scared because im going to jail but he said six 
months is a long time for anybody to go to jail especially on a 
charge like this 
siegel was imprisoned for defying a 1986 court order requiring 
him to tie his septic tank to a sewer line 
the problem began in 1979 when the siegels paid a fee to tap into 
the line when the line was installed it ended at a corner of their 
lot too far away according to siegel who said he would have had 
to spend 2000 and take down four large trees to make the 
connection 
siegel said the line should be extended in front of the house 
where a straight 30foot connection could be made 
ray patterson chairman of the james island public service 
district said the utility had been willing to extend the line but 
the siegels would have been billed an additional 200 which they 
declined to pay 
patterson said it would cost the public utility about 1200 
today to extend the line 
he said it would cost only 700 to connect to the corner tap and 
that district commissioners offered to come out on their own time 
and dig the ditch 
the utility bent over backwards to resolve the problem he 
said 
a charleston heights plumber on tuesday offered to make the 
connection for free but the siegels declined saying they didnt 
want charity 
whats the difference where the tap is if somebody puts it in 
free and you dont have to pay for it patterson said 
he added that the siegels were just looking for publicity and 
to get sympathy 
circuit judge william howell on nov 1 found siegel in contempt 
of the 1986 ruling that he make the connection and gave him 60 days 
to hook up or go to prison 
siegel wholl appear in court again after serving his sentence 
predicted hell probably be returned to prison 
i have a life sentence for not hooking up to an unequal sewer 
line he said 
he said more than 100 area homes havent tapped into the system 
but that he was the one who was singled out and eventually arrested 
patterson said the other homes were being handled one by one 
the public service district has spent about 40000 in legal fees 
on the matter including defending a 500000 federal lawsuit by the 
siegels challenging the utilitys right to require the connection 
officials said 
that lawsuit was dismissed last year 
it probably will cost more than 6000 to care for siegel during 
his sixmonth prison stay according to state department of 
corrections spokesman francis x archibald

the united states britain and france 
joined in vetoing a security council resolution that deplored 
the us navys downing of two libyan military jets over the 
mediterranean on jan 4 
just hours before wednesdays vote us officials said the navy 
had canceled missile tests in the mediterreanan planned for next 
week that libyan ambassador ali a treiki had called provocative 
the officials gave no hint the cancellation was linked with the 
resolution 
libyan officials have claimed for weeks that the united states is 
preparing public opinion for a us attack on a factory near tripoli 
that washington claims has been built for the manufacture of poison 
gas 
us officials said the cancellation of the jan 1617 missile 
tests is intended to reduce tensions between the united states and 
libya which washington accuses of fostering international terrorism 
canada joined the allies wednesday in voting against the 
resolution 
the vote was 94 with the soviet union china ethiopia 
colombia malaysia algeria nepal senegal and yugoslavia voting in 
favor finland and brazil abstained 
as permanent members of the 15member council any negative vote 
by the united states britain or france was enough to kill the 
resolution 
the resolution deplores the downing of the two libyan 
reconnaisssance planes and asked the navy to suspend its maneuvers 
in international waters off libya 
treiki disclosed the planned missile tests during security 
council debate tuesday night after the us 6th fleet informed 
libyan air traffic controllers so they could divert civilian air 
traffic 
us sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
canceled exercise was to have involved surfacetoair missiles not 
airtoground missiles of the type that would be used in any attack 
on libya 
deputy us ambassador herbert s okun announced the cancellation 
just before the council began debate and officials in washington 
confirmed it 
okun told the security council the american f14 pilots fired in 
selfdefense in the jan 4 encounter with the libyan mig23s a 
right nations have under the un charter 
these were not unarmed libyan reconnaissance aircraft as this 
council has been told they were highly sophisticated fighter 
aircraft and we have shown the security council and the world 
photographic proof that they were armed okun said 
on friday us ambassador vernon a walters displayed 
photographs of one libyan jet showing shapes resembling missile pods 
on its wings and fuselage 
libyas deputy ambassador ali sunni muntasser said the pictures 
were retouched and the planes were unarmed and on reconnaissance 
flights 
britain agreed that the us pilots acted in selfdefense 
british ambassador sir crispin tickell said the vetoed resolution 
was couched in the wrong terms and proceeds from wrong 
assumptions 
canadas ambassador yves fortier said the resolution contained 
a onesided account frances deputy representative m pierre 
brochand expressed similar sentiments 
in washington us officials announced that the navy will rotate 
two aircraft carrier battle groups well away from libya as one 
replaces the other 
they said the battle group led by the carrier john f kennedy 
from which the f14s flew would complete its sixmonth deployment 
and be replaced by the carrier theodore roosevelt starting late this 
week off western italy

the united nations achieved some of its 
most spectacular diplomatic breakthroughs in 1988 and ended the 
year more than 750 million in the red because member nations didnt 
pay their bills 
un financial spokesman fred eckhard said wednesday that just 86 
of the 159 member nations paid all their dues through the end of 
1988 leaving the world body 3949 million in arrears in the 
regular budget and 3552 million in debt for peacekeeping 
operations 
the united states the uns largest contributor was also the 
chief deadbeat owing 535 percent of the total arrears of both 
budgets 4017 million 
washington was responsible for about 77 percent of the arrears in 
the regular budget 3076 million the soviet union owed 2 percent 
of the regular budget arrears 9 million 
moscow was responsible for nearly half the arrears in 
peacekeeping 1721 million while the united states was 
responsible for 26 percent or 941 million 
the mounting debt exasperated un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar as the world body embarked on new costly peacekeeping 
ventures 
un peacekeepers are in charge of monitoring the soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan the aug 20 ceasefire between iran and 
iraq the cuban pullout from angola and south africas exit from 
namibia 
other peacekeeping missions are possible this year in the western 
sahara and cambodia 
perez de cuellar said in december when he accepted the 1988 
nobel peace prize on behalf of un peacekeepers that the failure 
of members to pay dues threatens the work of the united nations 
president reagan has ordered the state department to devise a 
payment schedule for repaying all us arrears 
undersecretarygeneral joseph v reed has said the department told 
him it would be a threetofiveyear plan 
until reagan ordered the release of 188 million and made the 
repayment pledge in september un officials had predicted the 
world body would be unable to meet payrolls by november 
the soviet union has also pledged to repay all its arrears and 
has worked out a repayment schedule with the united nations 
the total regular budget of the united nations is about 880 
million of which the united states is assessed onefourth and the 
soviet union 118 percent 
in addition to the united states and the soviet union 10 other 
nations owe more than 1 million to the regular budget south 
africa 339 million iran 79 million argentina 52 million 
poland 43 million romania 4 million yugoslavia 35 million 
israel 31 million libya 28 million peru 14 million and

theyre heading for the last roundup at the 
40yearold bar doubler ranch but the trail bosses hope they can 
find a new pasture for the only nocover nominimum 
countrywestern basement nightclub in downtown chicago 
an office skyscraper is planned for the site where the sundowners 
trio entertains the crowd and 30 varieties of chili are served to 
the folks who stroll in off randolph street 
the movie theater next door has already been closed but the 
ranch is still filled with the sounds of guitar picking for a few 
more weeks 
if the owners cant find a new location before the wrecking ball 
strikes the sundowners will have to find a new place to hang their 
white stetsons and night owls will no longer be able to find a 
315 chili mac tamale cheese salami bowl at 3 am 
however coowner arthur brown is optimistic hell find a place 
for the ranch which has been at its current location since 1978 
both of its previous sites got torn down too he said 
wednesday 
they tell us weve got three or four weeks maybe a bit 
longer brown said were looking at various sites in the 
downtown area most of the nightlife seems to be moving to river 
north but i dont think river north is for us 
river north a fashionable neighborhood with loft condominiums 
and art deco restaurants might not be the best place for a club 
that has a barbed wire collection behind the bar and bulls and 
heifers signs on the restrooms 
river norths nouvelle sensibilities also might be offended by 
the ranchs menu which features items such as the jesse james 
steak a steal and the occasional ornery patron 
when the musics going good and the club is near its 200patron 
capacity the cook who calls himself little bill sometimes has 
to double as waiter and calmer of the crowd 
when the parties get a little wild you might find someone who 
wants to pull a little strip show and ive got to stop them he 
explained 
for singer and guitarist bob boyd 57 the ranch has been home 
since he left chattanooga tenn 35 years ago 
don walls curt delaney and i have been the sundowners most 
of our adult lives boyd said we do about seven sets on a good 
night mixing in a little blues and a little pop with a lot of campw 
we keep four big books with a few thousand songs in them up by 
the bandstand in case we get an odd request the tunes are usually 
no problem but you can forget the words 
mostly though the old songs wear the best over the years 
weve had the most requests for roy acuffs version of the wabash 
cannonball and old bob wills san antonio rose 
the sundowners are the only act advertised on the ranchs 
streetlevel sign but other entertainers have been known to walk 
down the steps and sit in for a set or two red foley eddie arnold 
gene autry and mel tillis are among those who have dropped in over 
the years 
we know most of their songs boyd said frankly being at 
it as long as we have we know most of everybodys songs when we 
dont know a song then thats what id call an odd request

a man who spent 20 years trying to 
leave cuba unwittingly deported himself and his family from the 
united states for what he thought would be a 20 minute excursion to 
the canadian side of niagra falls 
three weeks after they left their miami home on the trip carlos 
fajardo his wife and two adopted children remain stranded in motel 
in canada 
they set out dec 20 on a christmas quest for snow which his 
adopted children yoandys 12 and yordalys 9 had never seen 
even though the family lived in the united states for four years 
immigration officials will not allow them back because they are 
illegal aliens 
we came for 20 minutes fajardo said no one told us we 
could not go back 
sen bob graham dfla has joined the fajardos cause by asking 
officials to let the family back 
this family has strong ties to the miami community through 
relatives business and local school attendance graham said in a 
letter to immigration and naturalization service officials it 
would be comforting to these people for them to be able to resume 
their wellestablished lives 
fajardo 39 a small softspoken man who tried for two decades 
to leave his native cuba said the family drove 1500 miles in their 
truck to niagara falls ny where they checked into a motel and 
planned to visit canada 
he told canadian border guards his family wanted to see the 
horseshoe falls 
when the family returned however us border guards demanded to 
proof of their citizenship all fajardo had was a florida drivers 
license 
at first fajardo maintained he was a us citizen later he 
said he was a resident alien but immigration officials after a 
search of their records determined otherwise 
benedict ferro director of the ins office in buffalo said 
fajardos wife bermaida and her two children entered the united 
states illegally in 1985 and fajardo entered the country illegally 
in 1986 
fajardo denies entering the country illegally 
an immigration judge in 1987 denied asylum to mrs fajardo and 
the two children she appealed the decision in august on grounds 
that she would face persecution if returned to communist cuba but 
her appeal was rejected 
fajardos application for asylum was pending when he crossed the 
border his status was officially nullified by leaving the country 
ferro said 
fajardo could reapply but his wife and children cannot because

the united states should abolish private health 
insurance and instead provide canadianstyle government coverage for 
everyone a group representing 1200 doctors proposed today 
our health care system is failing the group wrote it 
denies access to many in need and is expensive inefficient and 
increasingly bureaucratic 
they suggested a system modeled on canadas national health 
program that they said would cost no more than the united states 
current mix of public and private coverage 
every year as the costs of the current system go up and up and 
the number of uninsured people go up and up that will be a push 
toward this fundamental change in our system said dr david u 
himmelstein 
the proposal was drawn up by the 1200member physicians for a 
national health program and published in the new england journal of 
medicine 
the groups 30member writing committee was chaired by dr 
steffie woolandler and himmelstein the two doctors based at 
cambridge hospital in cambridge mass recently published a 
marxist view of current us health policy which also praised the 
canadian system 
there are people of all political stripes involved in writing 
this from the right to the left wing himmelstein said in an 
interview i am clearly one of the leftwing people 
a second paper in the journal written by alain enthoven and 
richard kronick of stanford business school proposed a less drastic 
plan for universal health insurance 
their program would retain private insurance but require 
employers to provide coverage for their workers those not covered 
at work would contribute through taxes and poor peoples coverage 
would be totally subsidized by the government 
these authors argued that a complete government takeover of 
health care financing would represent far too radical a change to 
be politically feasible in this country 
dr arnold s relman the journals editor wrote in an editorial 
that the time has come for universal health insurance but he 
did not endorse either plan 
himmelstein and woolhandler argued that a single comprehensive 
program is necessary both to ensure equal access to care and to 
minimize the complexity and expense of billing and administration 
funding for their program would be based on an income tax or 
other progressive tax 
the authors said the cost of extra service would be offset by 
lower administrative overhead making the total cost no more than 
the current system

actor began losing weight and having night sweats in june 1984 but 
it wasnt until a year later that he learned hudson was stricken 
with aids 
i was sitting alone in rocks home i turned on the television 
set rock hudson had acquired immune deficiency syndrome marc 
christian told a superior court jury wednesday in his 11 million 
lawsuit against hudsons estate 
i began to sweat i blacked out i thought oh my god im a 
dead man harold rhoden christians attorney asked him why he 
thought he would die 
because i had very intimate sexual contact with rock hudson 
and he had fullblown aids christian replied 
christian 35 an aspiring musician is suing the actors estate 
and former secretary mark miller alleging they didnt tell him 
hudson had acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
christian who said he does not have the sexually transmitted 
disease that killed hudson in 1985 denied defense assertions that 
he was publicityseeking opportunist who filed the lawsuit after he 
learned hudson did not include him in his will 
christian under questioning by rhoden said he had no idea 
whether he was included in the will 
the lawsuit also contends christian should receive compensation 
for emotional distress and fear that he had been infected with the 
deadly disease 
christian said hudson developed a sore on his neck in june 1984 
which hudson told him was caused by the sun and was losing weight 
his skin became very dry he had scales he was itching a lot 
he had skin rashes he began to sweat at night christian 
testified 
although he questioned hudson about the symptoms hudson told him 
he either was dieting had the flu or gallstone problems and miller 
told him the actor was anorexic christian said 
christian said he believed hudson and continued to have 
unprotected sexual intercourse with him until february 1985 when 
hudson lost interest in sex christian said he has been celibate 
since then 
it wasnt until he heard a july 1985 television news broadcast 
that hudson had aids that christian learned his lover had the fatal 
disease he said 
christian said miller called him from paris where hudson had 
collapsed to see how he was taking the news 
according to christian miller said hudson told him to do 
anything you can for the kid i may have killed him

as many as 30 political prisoners are being held in 
psychiatric hospitals despite claims by president mikhail s 
gorbachev that the soviet union no longer has political detainees 
activists say 
the soviet leader told the united nations last month that no 
persons convicted for their political or religious beliefs in places 
of confinement are being held in his country 
but the activists told a news conference in a cramped apartment 
the names of three people they say are political prisoners in 
psychiatric hospitals two other men at wednesdays news conference 
said they were former political prisoners and have been released in 
the past six months 
the us state department has credited the soviets with 
significant progress in its treatment of political prisoners 
saying it has freed all those held under laws limiting expressions 
of political and religious beliefs but a us official has said it 
still has questions about 30 prisoners who are considered criminal 
violators by the soviets 
a delegation of american psychiatrists is expected to arrive in 
moscow in late february to visit alleged political prisoners being 
held in psychiatric hospitals according to us embassy spokesman 
mike hurley he said the group expects to see about 20 patients 
alexander novikov 27 who said he was hospitalized as a 
schizophrenic after distributing leaflets on democratic rights 
said he personally met seven other political prisoners at the 
chernitovskaya hospital near leningrad where he was held until 
october he said none seemed mentally disturbed to him 
through them he said he learned of 20 political prisoners at 
that institution alone 
the doctors are sadists said novikov whose complexion was 
still white from his years of confinement these hospitals dont 
have a medical function they have a criminal punishment function 
and this is in the time of glasnost perestroika and 
democratization in the time of gorbachev said activist alexander 
podrabinik 
last year soviet officials announced that a new law made it 
illegal to commit a patently healthy person to a psychiatric 
institution 
valeri senderov who served several years in the perm labor camp 
for antisoviet propaganda said hundreds of people are still 
sitting in custody for political reasons 
podrabinik said they believe 20 to 30 political prisoners remain 
in the psychiatric hospitals but he knows the names of only a few 
the most recent to be imprisoned is anatoly ilchenko sent to a 
psychiatric hospital dec 23 in nikolaev near odessa he said 
ilchenko was working with a human rights group in the ukraine 
when he was called into a hospital allegedly to discuss his pension 
benefits on dec 23 podrabinik said 
the doctor demanded the names of people hed been meeting in 
odessa and lvov and said he was engaging in antisoviet 
propaganda podrabinik said 
ilchenko was placed in a psychiatric institution injected with 
drugs and remains there today podrabinik said 
ilchenko had been forced into a psychiatric hospital once before 
where electric shock treatments left him in terrible condition 
said podrabinik who is a medical assistant by profession 
others political prisoners still held are vladimir vasiliev who 
has been imprisoned for more than a decade and vyatislav 
cherkassian podrabinik said 
cherkassian is a member of pamyat a rightwing extremist 
organization that blames the soviet unions problems on jews 
foreigners and freemasons podrabinik said he had no wish to stand 
up for the organization but added it is wrong that someone 
should be hospitalized even for chauvinist ideas 
there have been cases where people were quite normal and they 
were turned into psychiatric cases by the pressure of the forced 
treatment novikov said 
anatoly makhinya said he was placed in a psychiatric hospital for 
two years for publishing a philosophy manuscript in the underground 
press the 50yearold man from the krasnodar region said he was 
transferred last summer from the mental institution to a regular 
hospital and released in october

thousands of copies of a fake front page of 
the arizona daily star declaring the united states at war in el 
salvador were placed in the newspapers vending machines throughout 
tucson authorities said 
police were investigating wednesdays hoax and executive editor 
steve auslander said the morning newspaper would pursue a civil 
complaint alleging copyright violation against anyone caught 
charges of misdemeanor theft of service and trespassing could be 
brought against anyone involved said police lt brice fuller 
the mock front page contained a headline reading us at war 
in el salvador 70000 killed another headline stating rebels 
seize initiative in el salvador ran above stories condemning 
reagan administration policies toward the central american country 
the mockup used type faces and design resembling those of the 
star but the phony front page was only about twothirds the size of 
the real one 
no group was mentioned in the stories and no one called the star 
to claim responsibility said managing editor john peck 
the content is a clear political bias peck said of the phony 
stories the ironic thing to me is that of the papers they could 
have chosen in the state of arizona they happened to choose the one 
paper which consistently does editorialize against the 
administrations policies in central and latin america he said 
larry martin circulation director for the publishing company 
jointly owned by the parent companies of the star and the evening 
tucson citizen estimated that 3000 to 5000 bogus copies were 
placed in as many as 600 star vending machines 
the star has a daily circulation of about 87000 
martin said the fakes were inserted in the machines after 5 am 
when newspaper employees finish delivering copies to the 1150 
machines in tucson 
we found them in machines virtually all over the city martin 
said 
he said some of the mockups were placed in stacks atop the real 
newspapers and others were placed between individual newspapers

the commander of next months 
planned shuttle mission says he is confident the flight will prove 
that nasas manned space flight program is back on schedule and here 
to stay 
were quite proud to be flying the third flight since the 
challenger accident navy capt michael coats said during the 
final preflight news conference wednesday 
were very anxious to show that were back in space on a 
routine regular basis 
flying with coats will be pilot john blaha and mission 
specialists robert springer james buchli and james bagian buchli 
flew aboard discovery in january 1983 and is the only other shuttle 
veteran on the fiveday mission scheduled to begin feb 23 
the mission coats said will initiate a busy year in which seven 
shuttle flights are planned including the first two designed to 
dispatch probes to the planets magellan to venus in april and 
galileo to jupiter in october 
discovery also flew on a mission last fall that was the national 
aeronautics and space administrations first since the challenger 
explosion of january 1986 
the shuttle atlantis was the next to fly it returned last month 
from a secret department of defense flight with severe damage to 
about 200 of the 28000 tiles that protect it from reentry heat it 
was the worst tile damage ever sustained by a shuttle 
two small cracks also were found in a bearing unit within a 
highpressure engine turbopump during a postflight inspection 
but coats who flew aboard discovery in august 1984 said 
wednesday he is certain both problems will be resolved in time to 
meet the february launch 
the engine problem is probably unique to that engine coats 
said adding that engineers are looking at discoverys engines and 
have spare turbopumps available 
engineers believe the cracks were caused by moisture that somehow 
penetrated the housing around the bearing 
coats said it appeared that atlantis tiles were damaged during 
liftoff by insulation falling off the nose cone of one of the solid 
fuel booster rockets 
but were also reassured because despite all the damage 
atlantis tiles took it survived he said i have a lot of 
confidence the tiles will see us home just fine 
discoverys main objective is to deploy a sophisticated tracking 
and data relay satellite it completes a network that will allow 
ground controllers to communicate with shuttle astronauts and other 
unmanned satellites 
several scientific and medical experiments also will be conducted 
during the mission and the crew will use a powerful imax camera to 
photograph damage to the planet caused by nature and man 
volcanoes in nicaragua and indonesia deforestation in brazil and 
madagascar the sahara desert in africa and global beach erosion are 
among the subjects to be photographed 
among the experiments planned are two student projects including 
one in which four rats will be used to determine how injured bones 
heal in the weightlessness of space 
the bone reparation process is an interesting question that has 
to be answered before man takes extended space flights said 
bagian a medical doctor who will observe the rats in orbit

the city commission has voted to seek 
dismissal of a theft charge against its former city manager because 
he faces a stiffer charge in alaska for using a bogus resume to get 
a municipal job officials said 
carl rt keyser jr who is accused of using false resumes to 
apply for city government jobs in four states was arrested in 
alaska on dec 20 on a theftbydeception charge filed in kentucky 
keyser 34 was fired the next day as city administrator in kake 
alaska a job he had held since october the huntington wva 
native was charged last week with firstdegree theft for allegedly 
using a false resume to obtain 28000 in salary moving travel and 
other workrelated expenses from the alaska town 
hes going to have some problems up there pikeville 
commissioner greg justice said wednesday theyve already got 
him 
justice said the more serious charge in alaska and the estimated 
30000 cost of extradition persuaded the commission to unanimously 
seek to drop the charge 
a formal dismissal of the kentucky charge was expected in a few 
days authorities said 
keyser resigned the pikeville job in august after only six days 
when reporters uncovered several apparently false entries on his 
resume he was indicted in october for allegedly failing to return 
697 in travel reimbursements 
keyser who is jailed in petersburg alaska in lieu of 10000 
bond has called the alaska theft charge preposterous and said 
he would have returned the money in kentucky had he been asked 
the kake city council hired keyser based on glowing 
recommendations from references on his impressive fourpage resume 
the resume listed masters and bachelors degrees in public 
administration from la salle university in philadelphia officials 
said he also listed experience as a consultant to the international 
city managers association and the international association of 
chiefs of police officials said 
officials say there is no record that keyser attended the 
university or worked for the associations in october the city 
managers group issued a warning about keyser in its newsletter 
leading officials in kake to investigate him 
kake officials also said they were unaware that keyser pleaded 
guilty in january 1988 to a misdemeanor perjury charge in florida 
stemming from alleged false information he provided while applying 
for chief of police in oak hill authorities said

a judge granted asylumseeking central 
americans another three weeks to leave south texas bringing sighs 
of relief for some of the hundreds trapped in desperate conditions 
by an immigration policy 
now we can go and be a little more tranquil about when we 
leave said jose narvaez romero 34 of nicaragua narvaez said he 
hoped to leave for a cousins home in hollywood calif on friday 
us district judge filemon vela on wednesday postponed until 
jan 31 a hearing in a lawsuit filed last week against the 
immigration and naturalization service 
the hearing had been scheduled for today when a temporary 
restraining order vela issued monday against an ins policy was to 
expire 
the order restored asylumseekers right to travel to us 
destinations while their cases are resolved they retain that right 
until the rescheduled hearing 
it will help some said city manager steve fitzgibbons 
adding that the crisis is not over for texas southernmost city 
we have unofficial reports that there are 20000 to 50000 
people still in the pipeline on their way here he said 
the red cross is operating four shelters for central americans at 
churches and fitzgibbons said they should be replaced by a single 
large center such as the local national guard armory 
the ins policy put into effect dec 16 required that asylum 
seekers stay close to the application center nearest their point of 
entry while their requests are considered 
asylum seekers unable to leave the area because of the policy 
resorted to living in primitive camps abandoned buildings and 
church shelters 
many central americans enter the united states in southern texas 
and file their requests at the busy ins center in harlingen 25 
miles northwest of brownsville mondays order sparked an exodus 
and hundreds of asylum seekers swamped the harlingen center to 
ensure their applications would be processed by thursday 
the ins office processed 967 asylum applications tuesday a 
oneday record and 739 wednesday ins spokeswoman virginia kice 
said in harlingen 
ms kice said the agency had asked the judge to postpone the 
hearing so it could prepare its defense 
we will be ready to go by jan 31 she said and we are 
going to fight it all the way 
she said about 95 percent of the applicants are here for jobs 
not political asylum 
mark schneider an attorney with the harlingenbased projecto 
libertad legal office and a cocounsel to the classaction lawsuit 
against the ins said the asylum seekers are ready for trial but 
welcome the extended travel time 
this should remedy the huge backlog of thousands of people 
stuck in the rio grande valley so i think well see a lot less of 
the hardship and the crisis that weve seen in the past three 
weeks schneider said 
bus companies added extra northbound runs tuesday and wednesday 
including a greyhound lines bus added tuesday evening in which the 
whole busload was going to miami said george gravley a greyhound 
spokesman in dallas 
those remaining in harlingen and brownsville continued to receive 
donations of food and clothing from the community 
whether you agree with everything thats been happening or if 
theyre illegals theyre still hungry said bob bush who with 
members of harlingens first assembly of god dished out beans and 
tortillas to central americans gathered at the ins office 
brownsville city officials wednesday took more than 100 central 
americans out of squalid conditions at the condemned amber motel and 
bused them to church shelters

presidentelect bushs choice to run the 
department of veterans affairs once endangered a south korean spys 
life by telling a south korean official about the mans plan to 
defect a newspaper reported today 
edward derwinski admitted telling a south korean diplomat in a 
1977 telephone call that the spy wanted to defect to the united 
states the los angeles times said citing unpublished records of a 
1983 congressional hearing before the hearing derwinski had 
publicly denied making such a call 
the incident occurred during the koreagate scandal involving 
influence buying on capitol hill the times said 
the spy highranking korean cia official sohn ho young wanted 
to defect because he was about to be transferred home from a post in 
new york city the newspaper said us officials wanted to 
interview him regarding his governments involvement in the scandal 
fbi agents arrived at sohns new jersey home and escorted him to 
safety only 30 minutes before kcia agents showed up an unidentified 
senior law enforcement official told the times 
this guy the korean defector would have been severely 
punished or killed as well as his family the official said 
derwinski a republican from chicago who served 24 years in 
congress publicly denied 1978 allegations that he leaked the 
information and refused to testify in the matter before a federal 
grand jury and the house ethics committee 
derwinski whose washington experience includes nearly six years 
at the state department refused to discuss the incident this week 
the times said 
bill anderson a former chicago newspaperman aiding derwinski 
during the transition described the incident as an 11yearold 
story a nonevent 
he was not charged with any illegal or unethical conduct 
anderson said thats the operative comment 
derwinskis involvement in the episode and his early lack of 
candor will be investigated during senate confirmation hearings on 
his nomination to head the new veterans department said sen alan 
cranston dcalif chairman of the senate committee on veterans 
affairs 
sheila tate a spokeswoman for the bush transition office said 
any questions that arise will be answered by mr derwinski at his 
confirmation hearings 
the times said us officials learned of the leak and were able 
to move sohn because they recorded derwinskis september 1977 phone 
call to the south korean embassy 
derwinski was the ranking republican on the the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on international relations which had secretly 
been in touch with sohn and planned to have him testify about the 
kcias involvement in koreagate the times said 
information about sohns plan to defect was so sensitive that 
former rep don fraser dminn thenchairman of the subcommittee 
told only derwinski the newspaper said 
derwinski now an undersecretary of state belatedly admitted in 
1983 that he leaked the information the times said the admission 
came in a closed meeting with senators just before he was confirmed 
to his first state department post in 1983 
a transcript of the hearing which was never printed or published 
by the senate but was found in the national archives shows that 
sen claiborne pell dri insisted on putting what derwinski told 
the panel into the public record 
pell said derwinskis telephoned tip to the korean embassy was 
an error in judgment the newspaper said

international drug traffickers are moving 
increasing quantities of illegal narcotics threatening governments 
stability and contributing to a sharp rise in drugrelated deaths a 
un report said today 
the 1988 annual report by the international narcotics control 
board which last year warned that drug trafficking groups in latin 
america challenged state authorities did not single out any region 
for particular blame 
illicit production and manufacture of drugs take place in a 
growing number of countries the 31page report says 
these activities continue to be carried out by criminal 
organizations which often join forces with terrorist groups 
spread violence and corruption threaten political institutions 
undermine the integrity of national economies and imperil the very 
security of countries it said 
in the united states the report said the estimated quantities of 
illicit drugs entering the country continued to rise especially 
cocaine 
one bright spot cited in the report was a 1987 survey of us 
high school and college students that indicated drugabuse declining 
among that group the survey found for the first time a 20 percent 
decrease in cocaine use by high school and college students and 
young adults 
the viennabased board works with the world health organization 
and other un agencies it said its report was based on data from 
governments the united nations interpol and other international 
organizations 
many countries provide information voluntarily 
however the report said that of the worlds 185 countries and 
territories only 10 angola bolivia brunei cambodia north 
korea gambia israel st lucia vietnam and zambia declined to 
provide drugrelated data 
during 1988 the gravity of the situation which preoccupies 
the highest levels of governments has led to strong 
counterattacks by governments the report says it singled out a 
coordinated enforcement operation in august that featured 30 
countries in the americas and western europe 
the effort led to the seizure of 12 tons of cocaine dismantling 
of 13 cocaine laboratories destruction of seven clandestine 
airstrips and arrest of at least 1000 people the report says 
in another development a un conference last month ended a 
fouryear fight against illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse 
adopting a document giving all signatory countries the right to 
extradite suspected drug traffickers and the right to confiscate all 
their assets 
but observers say the document signed by 43 countries may take 
years to become legally binding 
the report says drugrelated deaths increased sharply during 1987 
and the first three months of 1988 with heroin the main killer 
it singled out west germany where 1362 people died during that 
period compared with 606 who died in 1986 and the first three 
months of 1987 
the report also noted 
opium production in southeast asia remains high despite 
campaigns to eradicate opium poppy cultivation abundant opium 
together with the availability of essential chemicals facilitate 
heroin production in clandestine laboratories near the borders of 
burma laos and thailand 
transit trafficking of opium and heroin was reported to 
continue unabated in iran despite vigorous law enforcement backed 
by severe penalties 
in the soviet union health and law enforcement authorities 
have expanded activities aimed at eliminating the abuse of certain 
drugs and mindaltering substances stricter laws have been enacted 
to prosecute traffickers and serious drug offenses can draw up to 
10 years in jail

a jury ordered the local scouting council to 
pay 45000 to a youth because he was sexually molested by his 
former scoutmaster but rejected the boys 10 million claim against 
the national boy scouts of america 
the boy scouts called the decision a vindication of their 
treatment of the complaint and of the scouts supervision of local 
councils that hire scoutmasters 
the fairfax county circuit court jury had deliberated for five 
days after a sixweek trial before deciding wednesday that former 
scoutmaster carlton l bittenbender a convicted pedophile had 
molested the youth 
jurors agreed with scout attorneys however that the washington 
dc area council was liable for selecting bittenbender 
the youth identified in court papers as infant c is now 17 
and claimed he was molested by bittenbender over a 10month period 
in 1984 
the youths lawyers claimed the scouts were negligent in choosing 
bittenbender to lead troop 1970 because he had pleaded guilty to a 
molestation charge while a scoutmaster in rhode island three years 
before 
the introduced confidential scout files hoping to prove that the 
organization wouldnt act against pedophiles within its ranks 
because of the fear of bad publicity 
were very pleased with the outcome said frank hebb 
director of public relations for the national boy scouts of america 
the evidence at the trial clearly demonstrated that scouting is 
a local activity and that parents neighbors and fellow members are 
the people best suited to select scouting membership hebb said in 
a statement 
the youths lawyer douglas b wessel called the damages award 
grossly inadequate and said he will ask presiding judge richard 
j jamborsky to overrule the jurys decision at a hearing jan 27 
the damages does not cover the 58907 in medical expenses the 
youth has incurred according to testimony presented at the trial 
how this boy could have suffered 45000 worth of damages i 
simply dont understand this boy deserves better than this 
he said 
the teen and his family initially sought 30 million from the 
scouts and bittenbender but the amount was reduced during the trial 
to 10 million and the judge dismissed bittenbender from the suit 
ruling the mans actions were intentional and so not negligent

a west german convicted of illegally arranging 
the shipment of a solvent used in chemical warfare from the united 
states to iran forfeited his 350000 bond and fled the country the 
sun reported today 
peter walaschek a representative of a german chemical company 
did not return dec 1 to a washington halfway house where he was 
ordered to live while awaiting sentencing the newspaper said 
citing court papers 
walaschek left the house that day for a volunteer job and never 
returned the next day he called his american attorney and told him 
he was in west germany the documents said 
walaschek did not appear for his scheduled sentencing dec 20 
at the request of federal prosecutors monday us district judge 
walter e black jr who presided over the case ordered the 
forfeiture of 100000 in cash walaschek posted on the 350000 bond 
and the seizure of an additional 250000 he had on deposit in a 
washington bank 
federal officials refused to comment on what was being done to 
retrieve walschek from west germany and on whether anyone else was 
under investigation the sun said 
the united states has charged that west germany companies helped 
libya build a suspected chemical weapons plant 
larry ceppos walascheks attorney in rockville declined to 
comment wednesday citing his clients request he not discuss the 
matter 
walaschek who faces up to 10 years in prison and a 250000 
fine was arrested aug 1 on a charge he arranged the shipment of 
thiodiglycol from alcolac international inc in baltimore to iran 
via pakistan and singapore he none of those countries is allowed to 
receive the chemical without first obtaining special permission from 
the department of commerce according to court records in baltimore 
and st louis 
the export of thiodiglycol is restricted because it can be used 
to manufacture mustard gas a deadly poison first used during world 
war i 
both iran and iraq were accused of using chemical weapons during 
their eightyear war 
on aug 26 walschek an employee of chemco gmbh amp co pleaded 
guilty to one count of illegally shipping thiodiglycol to 
nonapproved countries and was sent to the halfway house 
alcolac said in a statement that it had been erroneously informed 
by the commerce department that no special permission was required 
for shipments of thiodiglycol to singapore 
the company said it had no knowledge of the alleged effort to 
divert the chemical from singapore had voluntarily taken 
precautions to guard against this sort of thing and had relied upon 
assurances from us agencies that the company was complying with 
regulations 
that assertion however was contradicted in a 14page affidavit 
detailing the scheme which the customs service filed in st louis in 
september

a plan to clean this citys notoriously filthy 
air by planting millions of trees and curtailing driving could help 
counter the greenhouse effect if copied by other urban areas an 
environmentalist said 
if were going to address this problem it will be a grassroots 
effort by activists throughout the cities of the world said 
jeremy rifkin director of the foundation on economic trends and a 
member of the global greenhouse network a coalition of 
environmental activists in 35 countries 
in response to federal pressure to reduce smog and local anxiety 
about growth and traffic congestion mayor tom bradley recently 
proposed planting 2 million to 5 million trees throughout the city 
during the next five years encouraging the use of public transport 
and ridesharing and weaning industries away from fossil fuels that 
generate high levels of carbon dioxide 
the 63point proposal represents the first urban effort to curb 
the worldwide greenhouse effect said rifkin who joined the mayor 
at a city hall news conference wednesday bradley said he would ask 
mayors of cities throughout the world to emulate the plan 
this landmark project initiated in a major american 
metropolis will focus on the urban areas throughout the world 
rifkin said 
it is vital for the future of the planet that we begin to 
sharply reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that 
contribute to the greenhouse effect 
the greenhouse effect is a term used by scientists to describe a 
potential warming of the earths temperature by pollution and carbon 
dioxide that trap solar radiation in the atmosphere many scientists 
fear it could cause the planets temperature to raise several 
degrees melting polar ice raising sea levels and flooding coastal 
cities and possibly disrupting agriculture 
rifkin said the most dramatic element of the plan is the proposed 
planting of trees which absorb carbon dioxide and produce 
lifegiving oxygen 
up to 5 million trees planted in the right places in southern 
california will conserve the energy equivalent of one to two new 
power plants said andy lipkis executive director of treepeople 
a conservation and communityaction group that is organizing the 
planting campaign 
the city has donated 25000 of an estimated 100000 needed to 
organize the planting which probably will cost several million 
dollars lipkis said 
among the specific recommendations of the plan which bradley 
unveiled jan 4 are mandatory parking fees at shopping malls 
replacing the citys cars and trucks with newer models that get 
better mileage and establishing tax incentives for home energy 
conservation

israeli warplanes today rocketed bases of 
palestinian terrorist abu nidal outside this southern port for the 
second time in 13 hours and police reported an undetermined number 
of casualties 
two israeli jets roared in at 1005 am to attack camps 
belonging to abu nidals fatahrevolutionary council in majdalyoun 
valley four miles east of sidon 
israeli military authorities said the bases served as a planning 
and staging areas for terrorist attacks 
the fatahrevolutionary council an extremist plo splinter group 
has been blamed for terrorist attacks against israel and western 
european countries most notably the rome and vienna airport 
massacres of december 1985 
a police spokesman said the two israeli jets in todays raid 
fired four rockets in a few seconds and flew away west toward the 
mediterranean the spokesman who cannot be identified under 
standing rules said smoke billowed from the valley 
fatah guerrillas at first turned away ambulances dispatched from 
sidon claiming there were no casualties 
but the police spokesman said the ambulances later were allowed 
into majdalyoun valley and returned with sirens wailing he said 
they took an undisclosed number of casualties to a fatah clinic in 
the drusecontrolled chouf mountains northeast of sidon 
these people fatah are clever in hiding their losses it is 
very difficult to estimate their casualties the spokesman said 
fatah guerrillas opened up at the raiding jets from twinbarreled 
antiaircraft guns but no hits were observed he said 
in israel the army said in a statement that the bombing followed 
an earlier raid at 9 pm wednesday it did not say if the target 
was destroyed but said the israeli warplanes had returned safely 
from both raids 
the attacks were the first two israeli air raids on guerrilla 
targets in lebanon this year according to a police count 128 
people were killed and 356 wounded in 25 israeli air raids on 
lebanon in 1988 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna broke away from plo 
chief yasser arafats mainstream fatah guerrilla group in 1974 and 
formed his faction two years later he is the most wanted 
palestinian terrorist in the united states and western europe 
fatah opposes arafats explicit recognition of israel and the 
palestine liberation organization dialogue with the united states

theyre no longer in the back of the bus now theyre slaves to 
the bus he said later now theyre spending two hours a day 
just to go to school not a school of their choice but a school 
based on racial quotas

president hosni mubarak today urged prime 
minister yitzhak shamir of israel to agree to an international 
middle east peace conference and said he wont visit israel until 
that happens 
all countries of the world except israel have accepted such 
an international conference as the proper framework for arabisraeli 
peace talks mubarak said a conference under un auspices would 
bring together concerned parties and the five permanent members of 
the un security council 
egypt and the palestine liberation organization say the 
conference should lead to direct arabisraeli talks 
mubarak discussed the conference and other matters at a news 
conference following a private meeting with austrian chancellor 
franz vranitzky 
mubarak told reporters he plans to discuss peace and other 
regional problems when he visits washington after presidentelect 
george bush takes office on jan 20 mubarek didnt say when he will

the first half of this year 
i have known bush as vice president we used to exchange views 
on middle east problems mubarak said we understand each other

peace that is backed by world opinion mubarak said

a longdormant geological fault discovered 
under the savannah river nuclear weapons complex will not affect the 
restart of the sites three reactors says a department of energy 
official 
we see nothing right now that would make any difference said 
steve wright who directs doe environmental studies at the srp 
the department and the du pont co which operates the facility 
on wednesday announced the discovery of the fault a fracture or 
zone of fractures in rock strata where pressure and displacement can 
cause earthquakes 
geologists believe that the fault the most significant ever 
found at the complex is no longer active and that its last 
movement probably occurred about 30 million years ago the 
department said 
the pen branch fault runs within a halfmile of the kreactor 
which the department hopes will be the first restarted this year 
after repairs and the site of a reactor that is expected to be 
built beginning in 1991 or 1992 wright said 
the two other reactors are several miles from the fault he said 
all three reactors have been shut down since august because of 
safety concerns and the idling of the nations only active 
tritiumproducing reactors has made the pentagon concerned about the 
supply of tritium which is used in bombs 
the radioactive material decays at a rate of 55 percent a year 
which means that it must be replenished periodically 
a geology professor at the university of south carolina said the 
fault which is about 300 meters deep at its lowest point isnt 
likely to produce an earthquake of any significance 
these are extremely shallow faults said pradeep talwani 
they just dont have the energy to have a large earthquake 
in 1886 one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded in 
north america flattened much of charleston more than 100 miles to 
the east 
the fault extends across the site in a northeastsouthwest 
direction for about 20 miles and is probably part of a set of other 
faults that run parallel with it geologists said it runs almost 
parallel to a previously known fault 
scientists plan to drill more wells and excavate trenches to 
learn more about the fault including its history and magnitude 
the preliminary report will be submitted to the bulletin of the 
geological society of america for publication later this year 
following peer review 
wright said that preliminary findings are seldom released before 
peer and official reviews but that doe and du pont realized the 
public has a strong interest in discovery regardless of whether 
the fault is active or not 
a full study by an srp seismic review committee is expected to 
take two to three years the panel includes experts from the us 
geological survey virginia polytechnic institute the university of 
south carolina and stanford university

us prosecutors pressured japans wartime prime 
minister gen hideki tojo into changing testimony at his trial to 
avoid incriminating emperor hirohito in war crimes a television 
documentary claims 
the british broadcasting corp documentary details of which were 
released wednesday by its maker edward behr said the us 
prosecutors worked with the emperors aides to find a way to avoid 
putting hirohito on trial 
the documentary challenges hirohitos image as a peaceful man 
forced to go along with his generals plans and alleges among other 
things that he 
must have known about the massacre of at least 20000 chinese at 
nanking in 1937 because he received regular detailed reports from 
the china front 
knew more than a month in advance of japanese plans to attack 
the us navy at pearl harbor on dec 7 1941 
the bbc will show hirohito behind the myth on jan 24 
behr is a parisbased journalist his biography of chinas last 
monarch was used for the awardwinning film the last emperor 
it has been reported previously that american prosecutors wanted 
to keep hirohito out of the war crimes trial and asked tojo to 
suggest the emperor had consented reluctantly to the war on the 
advice of the high command 
gen douglas macarthur commander of the us forces occupying 
japan wrote in his book reminiscences that he fended off 
pressure from britain and the soviet union to indict hirohito 
arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war 
behr told the associated press in a telephone interview wednesday 
that the documentary will be shown in the united states by pbs on 
march 13 
the bbc has also sold it to australia austria canada hong 
kong israel korea the netherlands norway spain and sweden 
hirohito died saturday at the age of 87 
the documentary says the decision not to prosecute hirohito came 
from president harry s truman and that tojos evidence was altered 
so the emperor would not be incriminated

the soviet union says it will try to maintain its 
minuscule aids rate by screening foreigners for the deadly virus 
even forcing mandatory tests of some visitors who cannot provide 
proper medical proof 
foreigners who want to stay in the country for three months or 
more will be subject to testing for the disease beginning next 
month foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
here there cannot be any discrimination gerasimov said 
we conduct tests of our own people and besides statistics show 
the soviet union is sharply lagging behind other countries say the 
united states in the number of ill people with aids and we just 
dont want to catch up 
the soviets once regarded aids as a disease spawned by western 
sexual depravity and drug use one soviet newspapers account had 
even claimed the virus was the result of a us biological warfare 
experiment gone haywire 
gerasimov said the regulations were introduced to supplement a 
1987 decree of the soviet council of ministers 
that decree made it a crime to knowingly spread aids punishable 
by up to eight years imprisonment and said anyone in the soviet 
union could be forced to take a test to determine whether they were 
carriers 
according to gerasimov the new rules go into effect feb 1 
summarizing them at a news briefing wednesday he said foreigners 
coming into the soviet union for over three months if they dont 
have certificates which would be mutually accepted by agreement 
should be screened 
as outlined by gerasimov the new regulations on testing for aids 
antibodies appear to exempt shortterm tourists but to apply to all 
foreigners diplomats students business people and journalists 
who live in the soviet union 
as of late 1988 gerasimov said aids testsof 17 million people 
in the soviet union had turned up 112 soviets who carry the virus 
as opposed to 334 foreigners residing in the country 
eight people have the disease five foreigners and three soviets 
he said 
we do not want this kind of import gerasimov said i dont 
want to say foreigners are a risk group but we dont take any 
chances 
gerasimov said a traveler who tests aidspositive may be asked to 
leave the country 
people who try to avoid medical examination or treatment may be 
expelled from the soviet union following a prosecutors sanction 
he said 
soviet doctors customarily use hypodermic needles that are then 
boiled to sterilize them for reuse but gerasimov told one 
inquiring foreign reporter dont worry well do our best so that 
you will have singleuse needles 
stephen walker us vice consul in moscow said gerasimovs 
announcement was the first indication hed had from soviet officials 
that us residents in moscow would have to prove they were 
aidsfree 
the us community in moscow numbers about 800 walker said 
rick kenney public affairs specialist for the us immigration 
and naturalization service said that since the autumn of 1987 aids 
has been on the list of contagious diseases which require a 
rejection of an application for a us visa 
pravda reported nov 11 that the soviet union had concluded 
agreements with britain denmark and its east bloc allies that 
require their nationals seeking to enter the soviet union to prove 
they are not aids carriers it did not say whether the regulation 
was already in effect 
gerasimov said the overwhelming majority of foreigners 
diagnosed as aids carriers had left the soviet union the staterun 
press has previously reported the departure of african students 
found to be infected with the virus 
last year the official tass news agency reported the first 
soviet aids deaths a 4monthold baby from the odessa region on the 
black sea apparently infected by its mother and a 29yearold 
leningrad prostitute 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims extremely 
susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread most often 
through sexual contact shared hypodermic needles transfusion of 
infected blood and from pregnant women to their offspring

for each review said she will cross into arizona and make the

telling them they cant stop me from writing reviews

newspaper articles

libyan leader moammar gadhafi is the most 
dangerous backer of the irish republican army which he has 
supplied with many advanced weapons and plastic explosives a senior 
british leader said today 
home secretary douglas hurd also said gadhafi has supplied the 
ira with a plastic explosive called semtex british transport 
secretary paul channon has said the czechoslovakianmade material 
was probably used in the bombing of the pan american jumbo jet over 
scotland last month in which 270 were killed 
authorities say they do not yet know who planted that bomb or 
why and hurd did not make any reference to the pan am disaster in 
his speech to a rome military academy 
a significant portion of the explosives and weapons held by a 
few hundred active ira terrorists are shipped from libya hurd 
said 
gadhafi is without doubt the most dangerous of the pira 
supporters he added referring to the dominant wing of the ira 
we have proof that he has supplied them with tons of sophisticated 
weapons and large quantities of semtex explosives 
he has also provided them with ample funds and as recently as 
september reiterated his political support for them said hurd 
british officials previously have said libyansupplied semtex 
probably reached the ira in three shipments that arrived in the 
irish republic in 1985 and 1986 
the irish government unlike the british has never pointed a 
finger directly at the libyans although it says it has told tripoli 
that it condemns the ira and doesnt want libya to support the group 
the predominantly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the 60 percent protestant province with 
the irish republic

prime minister yitzhak shamir today and demanded that the government 
do more to quell the palestinian uprising 
in the west bank town of tulkarem troops shot and killed an 
11yearold palestinian during clashes following the funeral of a 
palestinian teenager who died of wounds suffered earlier arab 
doctors said 
the army confirmed both deaths 
shamir who spoke at a mourning ceremony in brakha for a slain 
jewish settler was confronted by a crowd of 200 settlers 
they screamed demands that he put an end to attacks on jews by 
palestinians and chanted you are doing nothing 
shamir told the settlers that the greatest danger to israel was 
dissension among jews one thing only can hurt our ability to 
stand firm quarrels among brothers or worse civil war among 
them he said 
elsewhere in the west bank troops broke up a sitin by hundreds 
of jewish settlers near the settlement of yakir who also demanded 
the army crack down harder on palestinians involved in the 
13monthold uprising 
the army set up roadblocks throughout the area to prevent more 
settlers from reaching the site where the sitin began wednesday but 
dozens broke through one roadblock and were chased by troops israel 
army radio said 
also today 18yearold nasser mohammed salah irut of the west 
bank city of nablus was shot in the head and critically wounded by 
palestinians who accused him of collaborating with israel arab 
doctors said 
in hebron troops wounded three palestinians in a clash with 
stonethrowers the army said palestinian reports said the 
confrontation began after settlers opened fire on a palestinian 
youth who stoned their car 
in east jerusalem the army imposed a curfew on the silwan 
neighborhood and arrested arab residents according to prepared 
lists police said 
jerusalem police commander yosef yehudai said on israel radio 
that the action was the start of a new policy of imposing curfews on 
jerusalem neighborhoods to quell disturbances 
curfews are frequently imposed in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip but rarely used in jerusalem which israel considers its 
capital 
in tulkarem abdul ahmed abdul salam 11 died of a bullet wound 
to the chest during a clash in which hundreds of palestinians hurled 
rocks and burned tires to protest the death of another tulkarem 
youth hours earlier arab doctors said 
three other tulkarem residents were in critical condition after 
being shot in the clash hospital officials said troops imposed a 
curfew on the city and a nearby refugee camp 
the clashes were caused by news of the death of 17yearold 
marwan el maddeni of tulkarem who died at east jerusalems mukassed 
hospital after being shot in the head in a jan 1 clash 
residents called a general strike following maddenis death and 
raised outlawed palestinian flags and black flags of mourning the 
arab reports said hundreds of students poured into the streets upon 
hearing news of the death

palestinian revolt against israels 21year occupation fifteen 
israelis also have died

insufficient protection by the army they have sought permission to 
fire on stonethrowers and demanded deportations of palestinian 
activists on a large scale

prime minister yitzhak shamir told visiting us 
congressional aides today he would accept an active un role in 
arranging arabisraeli peace talks but not in actual negotiations 
his spokesman said 
avi pazner shamirs spokesman quoted shamir as telling the 
20member delegation that the united nations could send out 
invitations and bring the parties together 
shamir has been under increased pressure to find new ways to 
reinvigorate the peace process since yasser arafat chief of 
palestine liberation organization proposed a unsponsored peace 
conference and opened direct talks with us officials last month 
israel rejects such a conference saying the united nations is 
biased 
shamirs spokesman said the un role could resemble the one 
played by un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar in bringing 
iran and iraq to the negotiating table 
perez de cuellar met with leaders of both warring nations 
shuttling between their capitals to arrange talks leading to a 
ceasefire in august 
in order to get to direct talks israel is ready for the 
auspices of the two superpowers and is ready to have the united 
nations play a certain role in inviting the parties to negotiate 
said pazner 
the spokesman stressed however that israel would not agree to 
either the superpowers or the united nations getting involved in 
the substance of negotiations 
officials say shamir will unveil a peace plan when he visits 
washington probably in late february or march 
the liberal daily haaretz reported today that shamir would give 
french president francois mitterrand a preview when he travels to 
france in february

gov michael dukakis who just months ago could 
command a national television audience got a chilly response to his 
request for five minutes air time on massachusetts tv stations to 
pitch a tax increase 
dukakis on wednesday asked stations for time at the start of 
their newscasts tonight to make his case directly to voters 
wcvb said no news executive philip balboni called the request a 
completely inappropriate attempt to manipulate the news 
our responsibility is to cover that story but to cover it from 
all sides and then report it to our viewers and that is what we 
will do he said 
executives at wnev agreed to the governors request other 
stations said they were discussing it 
wbz demanded a copy of dukakis speech before noon today before 
deciding whether to give him air time a request dukakis press 
secretary said would not be met news director stan hopkins said as 
a result the station will not provide air time 
boston public tv station wgbh was not asked for the time 
managing editor john vanscoyoc said the governor would appear on its 
news show tonight in an interview 
its a way for the governor to reach the most people 
directly steve crawford a dukakis press secretary said in 
explaining the request 
crawford insisted dukakis was not seeking the tv time because 
news accounts are incomplete or biased he said the hope was to 
deliver to viewers the type of statement newspapers often provide 
when they publish texts of major addresses 
according to officials familiar with the governors thinking 
dukakis plans to seek up to 200 million extra income in the current 
fiscal year which ends on june 30 and as much as 600 million next 
year 
dukakis has acknowledged a shortfall of at least 600 million in 
the states current 116 billion budget a gap he attributes to a 
revenue slowdown

the government today said west german 
companies or individuals may have helped build a suspected chemical 
arms plant in libya and that it is checking for any violations of 
export laws 
the issue has aggravated normally warm relations between the 
united states and west german 
the federal government has indications of the possible 
participation of german companies or persons at this plant in 
libya chief government spokesman friedhelm ost said in a 
statement 
west german authorities are intensively pursuing these leads 
ost said without providing details 
he said the government is checking documents held by the customs 
service to decide if it should prosecute violations of export law 
that may have occurred 
earlier today government officials said indications that west 
german companies helped build and outfit the plant had embarrassed 
the government and damaged the nations image 
there is no question these allegations have caused serious 
damage to west germanys international prestige said a 
highranking government official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the government is in an extremely embarrassing and difficult 
position said the official referring to developments that forced 
chancellor helmut kohl to reverse statements that there was no 
evidence of involvement by west german companies in the affair 
earlier today authorities conceded unofficially they had found 
indications that at least two west german companies played major 
roles in supplying equipment for the plant and a shipper also 
implicated in the affair was arrested in belgium on wednesday night 
libyas ambassador to the united nations ali treiki said today 
on cbs this morning that west germans did help us not only in 
this plant in other plants also 
we have a vast cooperation with west germany and certainly some 
companies participated in this pharmaceutical plant treiki said 
the libyan leader col moammar gadhafi says the factory 40 
miles south of tripoli is for the production of pharmaceuticals 
not chemical weapons 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher conceded in an interview 
with the ard television network that there are a number of 
indications that evidently point in this direction of west german 
involvement in the plant 
federal officials confirmed a criminal investigation has begun 
against a nowdefunct frankfurt company ibi engineering and 
that investigators had seized company documents 
officials also confirmed that the documents linked another 
company imhausenchemie of lahr to the construction project 
backing claims made by the united states last month 
a source with the belgian justice ministry reported today that 
jozef gedopt directorgeneral of cross link of antwerp was taken 
into custody and charged with forging shipping documents for goods 
sent to libya 
under west german law the economics ministry must approve export 
licenses for arms hazardous substances or components that can be 
used to produce them there is also a ban on export of high 
technology to sensitive areas 
bonn last week announced that an initial investigation of 
imhausenchemie turned up no evidence of illegal shipments but us 
officials did not let up in pressing their case on the involvement 
of west german firms and the controversy has dominated news reports 
and political discussions in bonn

a law requiring rest breaks and special 
training for many workers using video display terminals went into 
effect today in a long island county despite a legal challenge 
suffolk county health officials who will enforce the law 
estimated that it applies to 8500 vdt users in 150 to 200 
businesses 
the measure is believed to be the first vdtregulating law 
enacted by a local government 
a state supreme court judge is expected to rule within the next 
two weeks on a challenge to the measure brought by four businesses 
the judge has already granted the four businesses a preliminary 
injunction blocking a section of the law that would have required 
employers to pay 80 percent of the cost of eye examinations and 
glasses for vdt operators 
suffolk countys 18member legislature approved the law in june 
over the objections of county executive patrick halpin who said it 
would hurt businesses and was of questionable value to vdt operators 
the measure applies to operators who spend more than 26 hours a 
week in front of a screen in a private workplace with 20 or more 
terminals 
beginning today those workers must be given a 15minute break or 
alternate work assignment every three hours 
the employers also must notify vdt operators of health hazards 
including eye strain and nervous disorders which may result from 
prolonged use of vdts and must schedule training in recognizing 
symptoms and taking protective steps 
the law does not include fines for violations but health 
officials can file civil charges to force compliance

the soviet governments highest executive body 
today imposed a special form of administration on the disputed 
nagornokarabakh region while keeping it within the azerbaijani 
republic tass said 
the decision by the presidium of the supreme soviet was another 
step by the government aimed at defusing tensions over the mostly 
armenian enclave which has been the focus of a violent struggle 
between armenians and azerbaijanis 
the dispute between armenia which wants to annex the area and 
neighboring azerbaijan has led to more than 60 deaths in almost a 
year of unrest about 200000 refugees have streamed across the 
border 
military law and a strict curfew were imposed in many parts of 
the two republics in november to quell ethnic violence 
tass said the decision today was made at a meeting of the 
presidium convened by president mikhail s gorbachev to consider 
urgent state issues 
there had been unconfirmed reports in moscow as well as the 
caucasus region for more than a month that the kremlin would 
transfer nagornokarabakh to the russian federation the largest of 
the 15 soviet republics in an effort to end the dispute 
but a tass statement made it clear the kremlin intended to keep 
the small mountainous region within azerbaijan 
the presidium found it expedient to temporarily introduce in 
the nagornokarabakh autonomous region a special form of 
administration with nagornokarabakh retaining its status as an 
autnomous region incorporated in azerbaijan tass said 
it did not explain what the special administration entailed and 
said a decree will be published later by the official press 
gorbachev said last week that a special commission of the ruling 
communist party politburo was to meet wednesday to consider the 
ethnic dispute between the two soviet republics in the caucasus 
there was no word wednesday from staterun media that such a 
meeting had taken place although tass reported that the communist 
party chiefs of the two republics met in moscow and agreed to try to 
persuade refugees who fled ethnic violence to return to their homes 
nagornokarabakhs predominantly armenian population began 
agitating in february for annexation by armenia and ther cause was 
taken up by thousands of demonstrators in the armenian capital 
yerevan and other armenian cities 
the demands led to violence between the two ethnic groups in both 
republics 
in july the presidium turned down the armenian annexation 
requests and opted instead for a program of government economic and 
social aid for nagornokarabakh

an outbreak of plague has wiped out onefifth of 
the prairie dogs at the rocky mountain arsenal but the onset of 
winter is believed to have killed the fleas carrying the disease 
army officials say 
weve lost 1000 of our 5500 acres of prairie dogs capt 
andrew kingery spokesman for the armys chemical contamination 
cleanup operations said wednesday 
no humans are believed to have contracted the disease but it may 
have spread to coyotes officials said only fleas not mammals can 
transmit the disease which usually takes the form of bubonic plague 
in humans 
kingery said us fish and wildlife biologists noticed a large 
decline in the prairie dog population last month 
the army restricted access to the area and called in an army 
entomologist but the weather turned cold and the scientist was 
unable to obtain flea samples kingery said 
so we contracted for a coyote specialist to trap four 
animals kingery said we forwarded blood samples from the 
coyotes to the center for disease control in fort collins and on 
jan 3 they confirmed the presence of plague 
the coyotes carried antibodies to the plague but it was not 
known whether they had contracted the disease he said 
kingery said there is no threat to anyone visiting the arsenal

a judge today blocked gov mario cuomos 
order to return an american indian to north carolina to face 
kidnapping charges brought after an armed takeover of a newspaper 
office 
madison county judge william obrien iii set a feb 28 hearing 
date for arguments on whether timothy jacobs should be returned to 
north carolina 
jacobs lawyers asked for the stay after cuomo signed a request 
from north carolina gov jim martin on tuesday to return jacobs 
obrien allowed jacobs to remain free on 25000 bail and told 
him he must remain in the custody of the onondaga indian nation and 
not leave new york 
district attorney neal rose opposed allowing jacobs to remain 
free saying that jacobs might flee as his extradition nears and 
that his freedom might send a message that new york is a safe 
haven for people who commit violent acts 
at least now we have time to make plans jacobs said i 
hope we are allowed to present the case on why i should not be 
returned to north carolina 
jacobs has said that he would not receive a fair trial in robeson 
county nc and that he fears for his life if he is returned there 
jacobs 20 and eddie hatcher 31 were charged in the 1988 
takeover in lumberton nc they said they took over the newspaper 
to bring corruption by county officials to light

fired monday made unauthorized investments for the beach city in 
highrisk government bonds in 1987 and 1988 resulting in an

a leading lebanese moslem shiite clergyman 
was quoted as saying there will be no developments involving foreign 
hostages in lebanon until sometime after presidentelect george bush 
takes office 
mohammed mehdi shamseddine acting chairman of the higher shiite 
supreme council in lebanon spoke in an interview published 
wednesday in the londonbased saudi arabian newspaper alsharq 
alawsat 
he said that the prevailing view before had been that the hostage 
issue would move once the american presidential election campaign 
was over but we did not see anything on the horizon at the time 
to indicate that 
but i cautiously expect that after sufficient time has lapsed 
following the new american president taking office that the issue of 
the hostages moves anew he was quoted as saying 
there are 15 foreigners believed held hostage in lebanon 
shamseddine who spent most of december in tehran recalled in 
the interview that he had predicted before iran accepted united 
nations resolution 598 the basis for the iraniraq ceasefire that 
went into effect aug 20 that the hostage issue would grow more 
complex 
contrary to the conviction prevailing at the time we expected 
the issue of the western hostages of beirut to become more 
complicated it seems our prediction was correct for despite the 
passage of more than five months after irans acceptance of 598 
there has not been any progress whatsoever in the issue of the 
hostages he was quoted as saying 
we still hold the same view that the time has not yet come for 
the issue of the hostages he said 
shamseddine said considerable prudence will be needed in 
dealing with the hostage issue but i say that ending the issue is 
not going to take as much time as it took till now until when i am 
not in a position to state or speculate 
asked about links between the hostages and the fighting between 
shiite militias in south beirut where the hostaes are believed 
held he said he did not see a clear connection but there was a link 
that he could not talk about in the interview 
on the future of irans relations with lebanon he said that it 
was intertwined with a lebanese political settlement noting that 
tehran backed the predominately moslem government of salim hoss 
lebanon has had rival moslem and christian governments since its 
parliament failed to elect a successor to president amin gemayel 
when his term expired sept 23 1988 
the 15 foreign hostages include nine americans the longest held 
is terry a anderson 41 chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press who was kidnapped march 16 1985

a court has given authorities permission to build a 
highway through a 17thcentury battlefield capping a 13year 
struggle 
the court of appeal says the transport department can go ahead 
with the fourlane highway across fields where oliver cromwells 
13000member parliamentary force routed king charles is 9000 
royalists in 1645 in the decisive battle of the english civil war 
in a unanimous ruling wednesday the three judges sympathized 
with historians opposing the highway but they said the victors in 
the 17th century battle at naseby in central england would have 
preferred the court to abide by transport minister peter bottomleys 
decision 
the wisdom of investing this exercise of judgment to a 
democratically elected minister rather than the court would have 
appealed to those who won the day at naseby wrote lord justice 
thomas bingham 
sir charles rowley vice chairman of the society for the 
protection of the field of the battle of naseby shot back 
cromwell might have been a bit of a destructive chap himself but 
he would never have approved of this

the defense department staged an unusual 
farewell review for president reagan today and the military 
services were told to absorb the undisclosed cost of the pageant 
responding to the military honors heaped on him in the 45minute 
ceremony reagan praised the 595 men and women in the armed forces 
whom he said had died in defense of freedom since he became 
president in 1981 
over the last eight years the lustre has been restored to the 
reputation of our fighting forces after a time during which it was 
shamefully fashionable to deride and even condemn service such as 
yours reagan told the assembly 
those days will never come again he said to applause that 
thundered inside a hangar at andrews air force base in nearby 
maryland 
but it is not just your fellow americans who owe you a debt 
the president said because we remained strong because we acted 
when we believed we had to in the last eight years not one inch of 
ground on this earth fell under communist control 
defense secretary frank c carlucci presented the president with 
medals from the defense department and its four armed services plus 
the coast guard at the opening of the event 
carlucci praised reagans policies which he said had contributed 
to the soviet decision to withdraw from afghanistan and the planned 
vietnamese pull out of cambodia and cuban withdrawal from angola 
your vision of a strong america assuming its rightful role on 
the world stage has produced lasting results our nation has moved 
from selfdoubt to selfconfidence he said 
much of the planned fanfare was canceled because of a steady rain 
that fell throughout the morning and the ceremonies were held 
inside a 14storytall hangar designed to hold the two new boeing 
747 airliners being delivered later this year for presidential use 
first lady nancy reagan canceled plans to attend the salute 
because she has a touch of laryngitis said a spokeswoman wendy 
toler she just isnt feeling well and decided not to got out in 
the cold mrs toler said 
inside the hanger were some of the fruits of reagans 
trilliondollar military buildup including the the air forces new 
b1b bomber as well as jet fighters helicopters an army m1a 
tank and one of the e4b aerial command post planes that is always 
standing by in case of war 
carluccis predecessor caspar weinberger also was on hand and 
greeted reagan as he sat down to watch a military review that bagan 
with a display by the armys colonial fife and drum corps dressed in 
revolutionary war garb 
the ceremony included a pentagon film lauding reagan and his 
decisions to invade grenada in 1983 bomb libya in 1986 and escort 
kuwaiti oil tankers in the persian gulf two years ago 
adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told 
reagan we want to thank you and thank you sincerely for the legacy 
of strength that you are leaving to our next commanderinchief 
you have made patriotism fashionable again and serving in the 
military attractive said crowe 
on a jocular note crowe cautioned reagan that the weather will 
not be like this in california referring to the drier climate in 
los angeles where reagan will live after jan 20 
among the outdoor events canceled because of the rain were 
flyovers of 17 military aircraft 
the marine band provided music and the joint service honor guard 
marched before the president every fourstar general and admiral 
was invited to attend along with about 1400 vips and government 
officials 
despite such elaborate preparations the pentagon said wednesday 
it could not estimate the cost of the farewell at this time 
funding for the salute will be absorbed by each of the 
services it said each service also is responsible for funding 
the attendance of their respective general and flag officers 
the defense department acknowledged it was not a normal practice 
to stage such a farewell for an outgoing president 
it has not been done in recent history the pentagon said 
but refusing to define recent history

the soviet union is suffering through a potato 
shortage and more than three out of every four spuds never make it 
to the dinner table because of waste rot and loss in transit a 
newpaper said thursday 
whats happening in our country with the potato the 
communist youth daily komsomolskaya pravda asked why is it on the 
list of goods in short supply 
the potato known to russians as their second bread is an 
important staple in many soviets diet but it has been absent or in 
short supply in many of the countrys food stores for weeks 
vladimir tikhonov a member of the soviet national agricultural 
academy told komsomolskaya pravda that soviet state and collective 
farms produce more than 31 million tons of potatoes annually twice 
the american crop 
americans though can eat potatoes all year because crop loss 
from the field to the kitchen is only 5 percent tikhonov said 
in comparison soviets buying potatoes a crop thats usually 
packaged with a generous quantity of dried mud and already rotten 
vegetables end up throwing out half the purchase tikhonov said 
it happens that if all losses are counted en route to the 
consumer only 7 million tons of potatoes make it to the cooking 
pot tikhonov told the paper less than a quarter of the entire 
harvest 
he called the potato shortage an indication of the woes of soviet 
agriculture as a whole which because of more than a halfcentury of 
state planning has been geared to meeting government production 
targets rather than developing efficient techniques of management 
and food transportation and storage 
president mikhail s gorbachev has called for the widespread 
leasing of stateowned farm land to individual peasants to increase 
food supply by allowing them to earn more for producing more the 
communist party has scheduled a meeting on agriculture in february

after 22 years of warfare curfews and 
atrocities the beleaguered ovambo people of northern namibia are on 
the threshold of emerging as power brokers in the transition to 
independence 
there is an air of excitement in ovamboland where half of all 
namibians live but there also are worries about the staggering 
problems that will confront a new government after independence 
elections nov 1 
south africa which has ruled the territory for 74 years has 
agreed to withdraw from africas last colony under the terms of a 
1978 united nations resolution 
the pullout of south african troops will deprive garrison towns 
of their main source of income the return of tens of thousands of 
exiles and refugees will strain local resources and the possible 
takeover of power by the swapo guerrilla movement could trigger 
vendettas against ovambos who worked with or fought for south 
african authorities 
to be free and independent doesnt mean we are suddenly in 
paradise said bishop kleopas dumeni head of the evangelical 
lutheran church by far the largest denomination in the region we 
can accomplish the task of nationbuilding only if we do it 
together 
dumenis plea for reconciliation is heartfelt his brother was 
killed by a military patrol and one of his daughters was killed in a 
bomb blast blamed on swapo 
ovamboland in the center of northernmost namibia covers only 7 
percent of territorys land but accomodates roughly half its 13 
million people most of them living in huts or corrugated metal 
shacks 
it is the region where the guerrillas of swapo the southwest 
african peoples organization has its strongest support and where 
most of the lowintensity guerrilla war has been waged swapo has a 
legal political wing operating in nambia but the guerrilla movement 
is outlawed 
in the coming months ovamboland is expected to become a 
political and propaganda battleground with an array of factions 
trying to ward off a swapo victory in united nationsmonitored 
elections 
holding swapo to less than twothirds of the vote would prevent 
it from having total control over the elected assembly that will 
draft namibias new constitution 
swapo sympathizers claim south africa will try to rig the voting 
to favor parties it considers more moderate ovambos say security 
forces are visiting villages with the message that swapo plans 
communiststyle collectivization and should be opposed 
swapo leader sam nujoma has said he does not forsee blanket 
nationalization of industries but his exact political and economic 
programs have not been spelled out 
among those caught in the political crossfire is peter kalangual 
chairman of the ovambo regional administration he has cooperated to 
a degree with the territorial government while at the same time 
trying with mixed success to maintain cordial relations with swapo 
true reconciliation is not a superficial thing he said 
for people whove been embittered its not all that easy 
in many cases the conflict has splintered ovambo families while 
one son may have fled north to angola to join swapo his brother may 
have joined koevoet a police counterinsurgency unit widely accused 
of brutality 
the parents are caught in the middle said kalangula 62 
they dont know whether to turn left or right 
israel shikongo who works at a human rights center near 
ondangwa predicted that swapo would discourage widespread 
retribution against ovambos who served in the security forces but 
would conduct some sort of reorientation program 
a retired lutheran minister sympathetic to swapo germanborn 
peter paully said some vengeancetaking was inevitable 
certainly people who have been really devilish will be hunted 
down said paully who moved to namibia in 1951 and has married an 
ovambo woman those in power in south africa have done nothing to 
defuse this situation 
the social and economic needs of postindependence ovamboland 
will be vast 
up to 100000 refugees and exiles many of them ill or crippled 
will be returning to a region already lacking adequate services and 
job opportunities 
many adults will lose their jobs as maids or maintenance workers 
when the south african army bases close changes will be needed in 
an education system where one underqualified teacher instructs 50 or 
more children in a south africandesigned curriculum 
some students are anticipating a utopian world where in an 
independent state everyting is candies and honey said denys 
nandi ovambolands education director i tell them the opposite 
is true if independence comes everyone must be prepared to work 20 
times harder

president reagan hailed americas servicemen 
and women today as americas pride at an elaborate military 
review designed by the pentagon to bid farewell to their 
commanderinchief 
reagan speaking at the end of the 45minute ceremony at andrews 
air force base outside washington also called for a moment of 
silence to remember the 595 persons who had died in the service of 
their country over the past eight years of his presidency 
they are not with us today because they are at gods right 
hand they voluntered they chose to serve they gave their 
lives they are our heroes reagan said 
the president was treated to as much pomp and circumstance as the 
pentagon could muster for the rainyday ceremony which was moved 
inside a 14storytall hangar at the maryland base 
although a flyby of military jets had to be cancelled because of 
the foul weather reagan was treated to a review of troops music by 
the scarletuniformed marine band and a movie hailing his military 
buildup during his two terms in office he also received service 
medals during the festivities 
arrayed as a backdrop were the air forces new b1b bomber as 
well as jet fighters and helicopters many of them purchased during 
reagans trilliondollar military buildup 
mr president the pride people feel today certainly the 
pride felt by the men and women in our armed forces is a direct 
result of the leadership you have provided as commanderinchief 
said defense secretary frank carlucci you have restored not only 
our national strength but also our sense of purpose 
reagan said he was thankful to have born the most sacred of 
tasks as the nations commanderinchief and to oversee a 
resurgence of spirit among the nations military 
where i have at times asked myself where have you come from 
how youve managed to cohere into the crack disciplined patriotic 
band of brothers i see before me this morning reagan asked he 
offered his own answer 
you come from america and you are americas pride on behalf of 
all america i thank you and pray god that he may bless you now and 
forever 
the president said he ordered first lady nancy reagan to cancel 
plans to attend the ceremony because she was suffering from 
laryngitis 
the farewell came the day after reagan offered his own oval 
office goodbye in which he said he was handing the nation over to 
the good hands of george bush 
in a televised speech bidding adieu to the nation reagan boasted 
wednesday night of his accomplishments and ignored many of the 
difficulties that arose during his eight years in office 
we meant to change a nation and instead we changed a world 
he said 
yet reagan also admitted that his selfstyled conservative 
revolution left many things unchanged and he asked his followers to 
stick around and help his successor 
if were to finish the job reagans regiments will have to 
become the bush brigades reagan said soon hell be the chief 
and hell need you every bit as much as i did 
the president said he was leaving office with the central message 
of his political life strengthened that an unfettered economy a 
strong defense and a free citizenry forged a nation respected in 
the world and looked to for leadership 
democracy the profoundly good is also the profoundly 
productive he said because we are a great nation our 
challenges seem complex it will always be this way but as long as 
we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves the 
future will always be ours 
reagan addressed the nation from his oval office desk his left 
hand in a splint and swathed in bandages from weekend surgery on a 
finger 
speaking nine days before his retirement to california reagan 
called his departure sweet sorrow but he also said he looks 
forward to a renewal of personal freedom contending a modern 
president must live somewhat apart you spend a lot of time going 
by too fast in a car someone else is driving 
another regret reagan said was his failure to tame the nations 
deficit but that merited only a paragraph in the roughly 21minute 
speech ive been talking a great deal about that lately but 
tonight isnt for arguments and im going to hold my tongue he 
said 
the national debt almost tripled in reagans term and he ran up 
the biggest budget deficits in history his final budget proposal 
released earlier this week for the 1990 fiscal year starting oct 1 
projects a deficit of 925 billion 
the presidents remarks were void of any mention of such national 
tragedies as the barracks bombing that killed more than 241 
servicemen in beirut the challenger disaster or the americans held 
hostage in the middle east 
there was no word of the trade deficits or the scandals that 
tarnished his administration such as the sale of arms to iran and 
use of the proceeds to fund the contra rebels in nicaragua 
illegally the contras subject of so many reagan speeches were not 
mentioned at all 
as triumphs reagan listed the nations economic recovery its low 
unemployment and inflation and its bolstered military 
the president who warned early in his tenure of the evil 
empire in the soviet union took credit at the end of his 
presidency for forging a satisfying new closeness with the 
soviets he said the new relationship helped bring about the first 
ussoviet treaty to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons 
as well as a new peacefulness around the globe 
what it all boils down to is this i want the new closeness to 
continue reagan said but he advised those who follow to trust 
but verify watch closely and dont be afraid to see what you 
see 
we must keep up our guard but we must also continue to work 
together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust he said

already have a good reading on those organizations that were capable 
of acquiring i dont want to say manufacturing such a device and 
getting it through the security gates that are in place to protect 
international traveling he said 
theres a real determination to stay with this he added 
but the intelligence chief said i cant tell you when or how 
soon the case will be broken 
middle eastern terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for 
the pan am bombing in which a plastic explosive was placed in a 
forward cargo hold in the boeing 747 jumbo jet 
usa today said webster asked whether the government of libya was

were in a position to say that 
asked about the possibility that soviet intelligence agents might 
pass on a tip as to who was responsible for the bombing webster 
replied i would guess they would 
its a view that i have held that conflicts with many who have 
thought that the soviet union was monolithically responsible for 
most of the terrorism around the world particularly a decade ago

to whatever extent their involvement in training and supplying 
and shielding terrorists a decade ago may have been true factors

attorney general dick thornburgh and 
independent counsel lawrence walsh today pressed the federal judge 
in the irancontra case to drop conspiracy and theft charges against 
fired national security council aide oliver l north 
walsh filed a memorandum under seal in us district court in 
support of his motion of last thursday to dismiss the two central 
counts the charges that would be dropped allege that north and 
three codefendants illegally diverted more than 14 million in 
usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
the memo was accompanied by declarations from thornburgh and 
walsh the independent counsel said in a statement the material 
outlines the position of the reagan administration that out of 
concern for national security it cannot allow certain classified 
documents to be disclosed at norths trial in support of walshs 
case 
us district judge gerhard gesell refused to dismiss the two 
counts on monday saying he first wanted an affidavit from 
thornburgh detailing the administrations objections to releasing 
the classified material contained in documents walsh wanted to use 
to prosecute north 
on dec 12 gesell said a substantial amount of classified 
material must be disclosed in order to give north a fair trial 
including the names of central american countries where north was 
involved in the secret resupply operation to the contras 
gesell also said that the ranks and duties of officials of 
foreign governments who appear in the classified documents must be 
disclosed although the judge permitted the names of the officials 
to be deleted 
gesell also insisted that cia personnel be identified as working 
for the agency although not by name and that the text of 
information obtained by intelligence be presented verbatim in most 
instances 
last thursday walsh moved to dismiss the conspiracy and theft 
charges citing norths insistence on introducing classified 
information in his defense and the reagan administrations refusal 
to release material the judge ruled north would need at trial 
north is still confronted with 12 felony charges that carry 
prison terms totaling as much as 60 years 
these include obstructing various congressional and presidential 
inquiries into the irancontra affair by preparing false statements 
and destroying documents

president reagan today released a report 
calling for increased spending of 81 billion to modernize the 
nuclear weapons complex over the next 20 years and the closing of 
four major facilities 
reagan said the 31page report will enable the administration 
and the congress to adopt a longterm approach to modernization 
rather than a piecemeal response to the problems within the nuclear 
weapons complex 
it recommended stopping nuclear fuels processing at four sites 
where problems have been highly publicized the rocky flats plant 
near denver the hanford site near richland wash the feed 
materials production center at fernald ohio and the mound plant in 
ohio 
waste management and environmental restoration at these sites 
will continue until completion the report said 
it was not clear whether research activity would continue at 
hanford which produced the material for early atomic weapons during 
the 1940s 
the report also said that the only three us reactors capable of 
producing tritium a critical element in modern thermonuclear 
weapons could not be restarted until late 1989 the three reactors 
all at the savannah river plant in aiken sc have been shut down 
since last april undergoing changes to make them safer 
in spite of these improvements and increasingly extensive 
maintenance the reactors may not be able to achieve acceptable 
production efficiencies said an unclassified version of the 
report released at the white house 
to meet tritium needs the report repeated previous 
administration recommendations for the construction of a 32 
billion heavy water reactor at savannah river and a 36 billion new 
design gascooled reactor at the energy department facility at idaho 
falls idaho 
the budget for fiscal 1990 includes money for the design of those 
new reactors 
the report also addresses the problem of cleaning up nuclear 
contamination around the 15 largest facilities in 12 states as well 
as modernizing the plants and closing down four of the most troubled 
operations 
the money would be spent mostly by the energy department which 
manufactures nuclear weapons and carries out related research for 
the pentagon

an architect of president nixons unsuccessful 
executiveprivilege watergate defense is a top prospect for the post 
of us solicitor general in the new bush administration

candidates being considered for the justice departments top legal 
policy position by presidentelect bushs transition team and

judges appointed by president reagan ralph k winter of the 2nd 
us circuit court of appeals in new york and kenneth starr of the 
us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
best known for his work for nixon during the 197374 watergate 
investigation wright 61 has a formidable reputation among lawyers 
as a legal scholar and expert on federal court procedure 
a university of texas law professor wright helped devise the 
legal argument that executive privilege exempted nixon from 
complying with a subpoena to surrender tape recordings of oval 
office conversations 
although the supreme court accepted nixons argument that 
executive privilege was a valid concept the justices ruled 80 in 
1974 that he still was not exempt from subpoenas for evidence needed 
in court cases 
in a decision that led to nixons resignation the high court 
ordered him to surrender the tapes which contained damaging 
evidence of white house involvement in covering up the watergate 
breakin

senate confirmation 
the solicitor general is the governments chief appeals lawyer 
arguing cases before the supreme court and deciding whether to 
appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies 
the solicitor is known in legal circles as the 10th justice 
because the high court has traditionally relied upon him to provide 
legal guidance

six people were pulled from the basement of a 
collapsed apartment building in leninakan 35 days after the 
armenian earthquake tass said today the men were quoted as saying 
they survived on canned vegetables fruit pickles and ham 
the survivors were rescued wednesday tass said the 35th day 
after the dec 7 earthquake that killed an estimated 25000 people 
in northwest armenia rescuers last pulled a person alive from the 
wreckage dec 26 tass said 
the six men were found under the rubble in the basement of a 
ninestory apartment building which had collapsed on them the 
official soviet news agency said in a report from yerevan the 
capital of armenia 
they survived because there was plenty of canned food stored in 
the basement tass said all are hospitalized in yerevan but none 
are in danger doctors told the news agency 
tass did not say how the six men were found or who rescued them 
officials had ended the search for survivors weeks ago saying it 
was necessary to clear away the rubble to prevent disease spreading 
from decayed bodies 
authorities have been demolishing buildings that could not be 
rebuilt after the earthquake 
one of the six survivors aikaz akopyan had medical training and 
administered massages to the others to relieve the pain of their 
injuries tass said one of the men karlen sarkissyan had a broken 
arm and the others sustained only minor injuries tass said 
on the day of the earthquake i asked five neighbors to help me 
carry two heavy wooden kegs to the basement akopyan was quoted as 
telling tass just then we suddenly heard a terrible roar the 
earth trembled and walls began to collapse i thought a war had 
started 
its true we used the food sparingly the 50yearold 
electrician said after all we had no idea what had happened nor 
how long we would be entombed we lost track of time completely but 
we never doubted for a minute that we would be found and released 
i had only one thought to do everything necessary so my young 
friends would not go crazy akopyan said i entertained them 
calmed them sang and told stories about my life 
he identified two of the other survivors as rafik simonyan and 
vanik khachaturyan he said he could not remember the names of the 
others 
akopyan said the men never had to worry about food and water 
because the basement was used to store tins of vegetables fruits 
and pickles 
its true we conserved the food in every possible way but we 
never doubted for a minute that we would be found and released he 
was quoted as saying 
an editor at armenpress the tass affiliate in yerevan said in a 
telephone interview there were no details of how the men were 
discovered because there is still only one telephone line to 
leninakan 
the editor who would not give his name said akopyan said 
nothing about the rescue or conditions in the basement and doctors 
were refusing to allow further interviews with him because he had 
developed pneumonia he said his staff had not yet been able to meet 
with the other five survivors 
the quake leveled much of leninakan armenias secondlargest 
city 10 miles east of the turkish border and left thousands homeless 
once home to more than 280000 people leninakan today has only 
100000 inhabitants thousands of whom now live in tents many 
residents have been evacuated 
survivors also have had to deal with bitter cold conditions and 
snow which officials said hampered the rescue efforts 
on dec 14 rescuers pulled a mother susanna petrosyan and her 
4yearold daughter gayaney out of the rubble in leninakan 
the two had been buried alive for eight days to keep her 
daughter alive after their only food a jar of blackberry jam was 
gone the mother had cut her fingers and fed the child blood

olympic diver bruce kimball was under a 
suicide watch in his jail cell today after pleading guilty to 
manslaughter by drunken driving in the deaths of two teenagers 
authorities said 
he is scared to death of everything said maj james cook a 
supervisor at the hillsborough county jail jailers checked on 
kimball every 15 minutes because of warnings from his lawyers that 
he might be suicidal authorities said 
a series of psychiatric tests showed he has been developing 
suicidal tendencies his lawyers said 
we told the judge we were seriously concerned about his 
emotional state and we told him of our concerns about 
selfdestructive behavior lawyer frank quesada told the tampa 
tribune 
on wednesday kimball pleaded guilty to spare grieving relatives 
who had just heard gruesome testimony on the accident his father 
said 
he did it for the right reasons a sobbing dick kimball 
father of the 1984 silver medalist said outside the courtroom he 
did not want to put the families of the kids through a horrible 
trial or our family 
the plea came wednesday as testimony was just beginning in the 
circuit court trial on charges that the athlete drunkenly plowed 
into a crowd of teenagers with his sports car in suburban brandon 
on aug 1 the late night crash injured six people kimball and his 
two passengers escaped serious injury 
the case drew international attention when kimball decided to 
compete for a place on the 1988 olympic diving team less than a 
month after the crash he failed to make the squad 
he pleaded guilty to two counts of driving under the influence 
manslaughter and three of causing great bodily harm while driving 
under the influence kimball who was jailed pending sentencing jan 
30 faces seven to 22 years in prison 
the plea surprised assistant state attorney john skye who was 
about to show jurors 43 color photographs of the crash scene 
obviously the pictures were the most graphically unpleasant 
part of this case skye said later 
before the plea hillsborough county sheriffs deputy karen ovitt 
testified about the accident scene for the prosecution 
she described finding two bodies on the road in pieces and 
two of the injured teens one bleeding badly and moaning another 
bloody and screaming 
killed in the accident were robbie bedell 19 and kevin gossic 
16 a 16yearold who survived lost a leg which was later 
reattached 
kimball met with attorneys from both sides in judge harry lee 
coes chambers for half an hour then emerged grim and glassy eyed 
to make his guilty plea 
are you pleading guilty because you are guilty and for no other 
reason coe asked 
yes replied kimball his voice barely audible 
among the victims relatives and friends at the trial was 
bedells fiancee dawn berrios who burst into tears outside the 
courtroom later and said im just glad its over i think we all 
know the carnage that was out there 
during opening arguments defense attorney lee fugate 
acknowledged that kimball had been drinking and speeding when his 
car hit the teenagers on a dark deadend street known as a hagout 
for teenagers 
his car was traveling faster than 75 mph and an hour after the 
crash his bloodalcohol level was 02 twice the legal definition of 
intoxication prosecutors said 
skye said another prosecution witness would have testified that 
after getting out of his car kimball beat his fist on the ground and 
said there go the olympics 
when kimball went to indianapolis to try out for the 1988 team 
members of mothers against drunk driving and victims friends and 
relatives gathered there and staged a silent protest 
but after wednesdays guilty plea dick kimball who coached his 
son in diving at the university of michigan said it was bruces 
decision i am proud of him i think it is something bruce is 
trying to face and im really sorry

drugs and housing problems worsened in urban 
america last year and the shortage of affordable housing is the top 
hindrance to local economic growth a survey of municipal officials 
said thursday 
the national league of cities releasing the findings of its 
annual survey of local officials criticized the reagan 
administration for major reductions in housing aid and for proposing 
to end local assistance to fight drugs 
the efforts of city leaders to fight drugs and crime to 
provide shelter and housing opportunities to encourage investment 
in jobs and to support the economic growth of their community 
said alan beals executive director of the league are being 
undermined by a fend for yourself philosophy that is irrational 
unconscionable and just plain wrong 
the league which represents large and small municipalities 
across the country released the results of its survey of municipal 
officials at a news conference it surveyed 690 officials in 473 
communities last month 
twothirds of the town officials reported local drug problems had 
worsened in 1988 and crime was described as worsening by 45 percent 
in the face of unrelenting drug trafficking and drugrelated 
violence the president wants to abolish funding for local drug 
assistance beals said 
ranked next among worsening conditions was the affordability of 
housing affordability of rental housing and homelessness forty 
percent or more of the respondents reported a worsening in each of 
those related categories 
a majority 51 percent said the supply of affordable housing is 
inadequate for growth ranking that problem ahead of roads 
education and other issues as impediments to economic development 
beals said president reagans budget proposal for fiscal 1990 
the federal fiscal year opening oct 1 would eliminate local 
revenue bonds for housing cut aid for the homeless in half cut 
lowincome energy assistance by onequarter and make reductions in 
spending for community development rental rehabilitation and 
lowincome housing assistance 
despite the reported problems more than half the officials 
reported overall economic conditions improved in their cities in 
1988 and nearly half said unemployment diminished 
twothirds said they expected to hold the line on taxes in the 
coming year but 61 percent said they expected to raise fees and 
other charges 
those surveyed included officials from cities and towns of all 
sizes and regions some 47 percent of them were in the category of 
small cities with populations of 10000 to 50000

greek and american officials thursday ended 
another round of talks on us military bases without making much 
headway toward a new agreement a government spokesman said 
a disagreement of views continues to be observable even though 
a deadlock was not noted said greek government spokesman sotiris 
kostopoulos 
a spokeswoman for the us embassy declined to comment on the 
threeday talks 
it was the first round of talks since a fiveyear operating 
agreement for the four us military installations expired dec 20 
under the old accord the united states has 17 months to negotiate a 
new agreement or dismantle the bases 
the talks were held as in the past in a serious and 
professional climate and an exchange of views continued 
kostopoulos said 
he said the talks the 13th round since negotiations began in 
november 1987 focused on the legal aspects of a possible new 
agreement he did not elaborate 
he added however that negotiators were still at the 
preamble stage of a new accord 
discussion resumed on the preamble of a new agreementwhich 
has been under continuous processing during the negotiations he 
said 
the talks have made little progress because of the socialist 
governments insistence that a new agreement provide assurances that 
the united states will help solve the countrys longtanding disputes 
with neighboring turkey the two nato allies have been at odds over 
military control of the aegean sea its seabed mineral rights and 
the divided eastern mediterranean island of cyprus 
us officials say they dont want to involve regional politics 
in the bilateral bases talks 
premier andreas papandreou whose ruling panhellenic socialist 
movement has been rocked by series of financial scandals is 
expected to use the bases issue to attract leftist voters in the 
upcoming june elections 
in order to bolster public support papandreou has said he will 
hold a national referendum on the bases and announced his intention 
to scrap one of the installations hellenikon air force base 
adjacent to athens airport 
three other major bases have been operating here since the early 
1950s another near athens and two on the southern island of crete

a tshirt being sold at the us border 
patrol museum has been removed after complaints that it was 
emblazoned with an ethnic slur 
the 10 shirt is black and shows a grinning mexican whose foot is 
thrust through a wire fence with the slogan who are you going to 
call in an apparent spoof of the movie ghostbusters 
the shirt has a circle slashed diagonally by a bar printed over 
the man wearing a widebrimmed sombrero in the movie 
ghostbusters the slashed circle was printed over a ghost to 
represent a ghost exterminating business 
its obviously racist i detest the racist attitudes we have in 
el paso said robert conner a registered nurse and freelance 
writer who complained about the shirts to the border patrol and the 
el paso times i thought that was a particularly obnoxious

morton thiokol inc has tentatively 
rescheduled its final fullscale testfiring of the redesigned space 
shuttle booster rocket for wednesday 
the firing will be the sixth and last fullscale test to formally 
qualify major design features of the 126footlong solidfuel 
rocket morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab said thursday 
the new booster already has been used on two successful shuttle 
missions 
raab said the test initially set for tuesday at the companys 
plant 25 miles west of brigham city was delayed because engineers 
said additional time was needed to adequately chill the solidfuel 
motor 
the procedure is necessary to test the redesigned rockets new 
heating system properly 
nasa ordered the rocket redesigned after a presidential 
commission blamed a faulty seal on one of challengers boosters for 
the jan 28 1986 explosion that killed its sevenmember crew 
investigators found that one of the challenger boosters oring 
joint seals failed to contain superhot gases during launch the 
gases ignited the shuttles exterior fuel tank 
the disaster grounded the nations manned space flight program 
until last fall when nasa launched discovery using revamped 
boosters that included more and stronger orings 
morton thiokol engineers examined the new orings after shuttle 
launches on sept 29 and dec 2 and found them in excellent 
condition raab said

drexel burnham lambert inc said today it has 
asked former securities and exchange commissionchairman john shad to 
become chairman of the wall street giant struggling to rebound from 
a scandal raised by the sec under shads leadership 
the nations fifthlargest securities firm also said it had 
approached roderick m hills sec chairman from 1975 to 1977 to 
become a drexel director hills a trade consultant is the husband 
of carla hills tapped by presidentelect bush to be us trade 
representative 
drexel said chief executive officer frederick joseph 
instrumental in the firms record 650 million settlement last month 
of securitiesfraud charges would continue in that role there had 
been rumors he might resign 
the announcements appeared to reflect an effort by drexels 
senior management to distance the firm as much as possible from the 
wall street insider trading scandal that has entangled it since late 
1986 
the firms objective is to develop a fresh outlook on the 
problems and opportunities it faces and to continue to make an 
important contribution to the nations capital markets drexel 
said in a statement disclosing the job offers 
leonardo williams information officer for the us embassy at 
the hague netherlands where shad is ambassador confirmed in a 
telephone query that hed been approached by drexel burnham about 
becoming chairman of the board 
neither williams nor drexel would comment on a report in the new 
york times today that quoted unidentified sources as saying shad was 
close to accepting a drexel offer 
it was not clear whether hills would accept the drexel 
invitation a receptionist at the manchester group ltd a 
washingtonbased consulting firm of which hills is chairman said he 
was out of the office 
shad ran the sec when it began a fraud probe of drexel more than 
two years ago after speculator ivan boesky implicated the firm in 
his illegal acts 
that probe resulted in sec securitiesfraud charges against 
drexel as well as a record 650 million plea bargain with the us 
attorneys office last month 
the firm has been seeking a wellknown and respected figure to 
take the chairmans job as part of an effort to recover from its 
legal ordeal 
shad is credited with strengthening the agencys efforts to 
reduce insider trading and other abuses on wall street he resigned 
in 1987 after a sixyear tenure to accept the ambassadors post 
word that shad had been approached came a day after drexel said 
it had agreed to end talks with former sen howard baker about a 
possible role for the former white house chief of staff in the 
firms senior management 
baker had been negotiating with drexel since november about a 
senior role in the management of the nations fifthbiggest 
securities firm possibly as chairman 
his involvement was seen as part of a possible drexel strategy to 
minimize the impact of criminal charges that were then expected 
against the firm and some of its key employees 
the announcement came as drexel and the sec worked to settle a 
civil suit filed by the agency against the firm in september the 
settlement of criminal charges was reached dec 21 but is not final 
until resolution of the sec suit 
drexel officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
talks might be completed in a few days sec spokeswoman mary mccue 
declined to comment 
the government investigation into drexels financial dealings 
began more than two years ago after nowimprisoned speculator ivan 
boesky turned states evidence and implicated the firm in his 
illegal acts 
drexel denied wrongdoing until last month when it was threatened 
with possibly crippling charges of racketeering unless it agreed to 
plead guilty to lesser charges 
under its settlement agreement drexel will plead guilty to six 
unspecified felonies pay a record 650 million in fines and 
restitution and cooperate in the governments crackdown on 
securities fraud

a businessman whose efforts at philanthropy once 
were rebuffed by an entire school has turned to bicycles as a way to 
peddle education 
frank argenbright is offering 1500 students at 22 atlanta 
elementary schools free bicycles if they improve their attendance 
behavior and grades 
to me it will be a real ego thing for these kids to show off 
those bikes said argenbright chief executive officer of the 
security and transportation firm argenbright inc theyll have 
worked hard to earn them 
schools were chosen for their low or declining test scores and 
only students who arent living up to their potential will be 
offered a chance to earn a new bicycle 
the principal and teachers at each of the participating schools 
will select students for the program and will draw up a personal 
challenge for each child specifying what changes in attendance 
academic achievement and discipline must be demonstrated in order to 
earn the bicycle 
these are our students with the greatest potential to 
improve said atlanta superintendent j jerome harris 
i think this is an excellent program that will have a needed 
impact on the students said kimberly elementary school principal 
effie turner our underachievers and those children who are 
overlooked or who are continually posing problems need that extra 
incentive and this appears to be the answer 
the program will be launched at the atlanta civic center on jan 
19 and the students progress will be monitored weekly 
argenbright promised to pay the administrative costs of the 
program and chip in at least 5000 toward the purchase of the 
bicycles he will try to raise another 100000 from large 
corporations 
argenbright hopes his latest plan will be more popular than last 
years offer of a free college education to each graduate of madison 
high school in his hometown of madison fla he flew 40 madison 
students to morris brown college in atlanta to tour the city and 
campus 
and then not one single student even bothered to fill out the

a proiranian shiite moslem militia 
entrenched on a mountaintop turned back a rival faction in fierce 
fighting thursday in southern lebanon 
west of the battle in jbaa israeli warplanes bombed a 
palestinian base it said was used for planning a staging terrorist 
attacks 
thursday marked the fifth straight day of fighting in the latest 
battle between the prosyrian amal militia and the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god 
police said amal lost five combatants in an aborted attack to 
capture the mountain village of jbaa 10 miles southeast of sidon 
a police spokesman said seven amal militiamen also were injured 
in the attempt to storm hezbollah positions 
a police spokesman said there was no report on hezbollahs 
possible casualties in jbaa the key to a triangularshaped enclave 
on the western edge of israels selfproclaimed security zone in 
south lebanon about 500 hezbollah fighters held the spot 
the new casualties brought the overall toll to 112 killed and 227 
wounded in the fighting since sunday 
four israeli warplanes meanwhile attacked a base of palestinian 
abu nidals fatahrevolutionary council faction in the majdalyoun 
valley before dawn 
the police spokesman who cannot be identified in line with 
police rules said two of the jets fired four rockets into the base 
located about four miles east of sidon 
ambulances evacuated the wounded but a casualty count was not 
available 
the fatah revolutionary council is clever in hiding their 
losses it is very difficult to estimate their casualties the 
police spokesman said 
smoke billowed from the base which israeli warplanes also bombed 
wednesday night along with another council stronghold in the nearby 
village of bkusta in israels first air attack into lebanon this 
year 
israel said its jets returned safely 
the battle between the shiite factions is the fourth major 
confrontation since april for control of lebanons 1 million 
shiites the nations largest sect 
by police count 388 people were killed and 1209 wounded in the 
previous three rounds of fighting 
hezbollah seeks to create an islamic republic in lebanon 
patterned after ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime in iran 
the more secular amal rejects irans spiritual influence over 
lebanons shiites and favors a multisect government with moslems 
sharing power equally with christians 
amal called a general strike for friday in predominantly shiite 
areas of lebanon to protest what it called hezbollahs new 
nazism 
amal was referring to atrocities committed by hezbollah fighters 
in an attack against jbaa and four other villages in the region 
sunday 
police said both groups have committed horrific atrocities in 
their current confrontation victims from both factions have been 
found with their heads chopped off or their bodies otherwise maimed 
the police spokesman said the vanguard of a 1000strong amal 
force attacking from the west southwest and south reached jbaa 
early in the day thursday but was pushed back by hezbollahis in 
fierce fighting 
amal pulled its attackers back to nearby villages in tanks and 
armored personnel carriers behind a heavy artillery cover the 
spokesman said 
an amal commander in sidon identified only by his codename of 
abu jamal confirmed that the attack failed 
jbaa is a mountain peak our fighters are in the valleys and we 
have to climb up to the hezbollahis this is not an easy task he 
said 
abu jamal said his forces blocked all supply lines to the 
ninesquaremile enclave which stretches southeast from jbaa to the 
nearby hamlets of ein bouswar and louwaizeh and the wooded slopes of 
mount safi 
we will besiege them for a while until they run out of 
supplies and ammunition and then try again we dont want to 
sacrifice our fighters in a battle than we can win easily after a 
while he said

investigators got a first look at the engines from 
a crashed boeing 737 on thursday and british airlines flying 
similar craft said they found no evidence of faults in the engine 
warning systems 
the engines from the british midland boeing 737400 that crashed 
sunday were removed from an embankment along a freeway near the town 
of kegworth and taken to nearby east midlands airport 
the plane bound for belfast northern ireland crashed while 
trying an emergency landing at the airport killing 44 people and 
injuring 82 
investigators are trying to determine why the planes apparently 
working right engine was turned off during the flight when later 
examination showed it was the left engine that caught fire 
speculations have focused on a faulty engine warning system and crew 
error 
most of the wreckage will be reassembled at the royal aircraft 
establishment at farnborough said ed trimble a senior inspector 
from the department of transport air accidents investigation branch 
the engines however will be taken to paris for detailed 
inspection by the manufacturer following a preliminary inspection at 
east midlands airport he said 
we must await a full strip inspection of both engines thats 
most important trimble said 
on wednesday the civil aviation authority ordered british 
airlines using boeing 737s and airbus a320s equipped with the 
usfrench cfm56 engine to inspect the fire and vibration warning 
systems for leftright sense 
those checks were completed thursday by six airlines and none 
found any problems the aviation authority also ordered more 
frequent inspections of the engines built by cfm a joint venture of 
snecma of france and general electric of the united states 
the us federal aviation administration also has ordered checks 
of the warning systems of 300 boeing 737s operated by us carriers 
unlike the british agency however the faa did not order more 
frequent engine inspections 
fred farrar a spokesman for the faa in washington said there 
had been very very isolated incidents of crosswiring of 
warning systems in us aircraft but he said none had led to an 
accident 
the air accidents investigation branch said wednesday it obtained 
evidence early in the investigation that both engines might have 
suffered a related failure 
the us national transportation safety board said there have 
been two crashes involving double failures of cfm56 engines in both 
cases foul weather was a contributing factor but that was not an 
element in the british midland disaster 
the times of london reported thursday that investigators believed 
the disaster began shortly after takeoff from heathrow airport with 
the failure of the no 3 bearing in the left engine which created 
vibration and intense heat 
as the captain throttled back on the damaged engine to prepare 
for an emergency landing the times said the vibration would have 
ceased and if the right engine had been shut down could have 
disguised the fact that the wrong engine had been turned off 
the times said investigators believe that the no 3 bearing just 
behind the engines highpressure compressor broke down completely 
as the aircraft made its final approach leaving the 737 without 
power 
the newspaper said investigators believe that faulty wiring led 
to a false warning that the right engine not the left was on fire 
however it said the plugs that attach the warning circuits to 
cockpit levers are designed to prevent right and left from being 
accidentally swapped and there was no indication how a false 
warning could have been given 
a tranport department spokesman refused to comment on the 
newspapers report 
the first funerals for crash victims were held thursday in 
belfast denis maloney 65 and his wife pearl 59 were always 
together in life and their bodies were found together in death 
they died in each others arms the rev aidan kerr said at a 
requiem mass at st brigids roman catholic church

offenses including dereliction of duty and disobeying an order the 
marine corp said

anzio normandy and jimmy doolittles thirty 
seconds over tokyo world war ii terms that probably mean nothing 
to many americans were cited by president reagan in a farewell 
address that cautioned his countrymen against forgetting their 
history 
reagan urged building patriotism through better knowledge of 
history 
if we forget what we did we wont know who we are he said 
in his broadcast wednesday night i am warning of an eradication 
of the american memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of 
the american spirit 
he specifically mentioned why the pilgrims came to america 
from europe in the 17th century in quest of religious freedom who 
jimmy doolittle was and what those 30 seconds over tokyo meant 
as well as the battle at anzio italy and the landing at normandy 
france 
those examples of american derringdo and heroism may mean little 
to the 69 percent of the american population born since the end of 
world war ii 
the details 
thirty seconds over tokyo an america demoralized by the 
surprise and destructive japanese attack on american forces at pearl 
harbor hawaii on dec 7 1941 and the subsequent heavy losses to 
the japanese in the first months of the war was electrified by news 
of the first us bombing raid of tokyo and other japanese cities 
the country finally had something to cheer about 
the daring raid occurred on april 18 1942 lt col james 
doolittle led 16 b25 mitchell bombers first word came from 
tokyo radio but confirmation came a month later from president 
franklin d roosevelt who said the planes took off from 
shangrila a fictitious place but later it was disclosed 
that they had taken off from the deck of an aircraft carrier the 
uss hornet the raid in addition to bolstering american morale 
slowed the japanese offensive 
later doolittle a former stunt flyer flight teacher and 
aeronautics pioneer was awarded the medal of honor the term 30 
seconds over tokyo was the title of a popular movie about the raid 
anzio the anzio beachhead 33 miles south of rome saw some of 
the bloodiest fighting of world war ii and accounted for many of the 
10000 us battle deaths in italy the first half of 1944 anzio was 
a bloody way station on the road to rome 
normandy the site on the atlantic coast of france of the 
allied invasion by land sea and air of the european mainland which 
started june 6 1944 after bitter fighting the nazis retreated 
the landing began the climactic stage of the war on the west 
european front the drive from the atlantic to the german homeland 
culminating in the nazi surrender the following year 
reagan recalled that on the 40th anniversary of the normandy 
landings he read a letter from a young woman whose late father had 
fought at omaha beach a normandy sector 
the writer lisa zanatta henn said we will always remember 
we will never forget what the boys of normandy did reagan noted 
adding well lets help her keep her word 
reagan said americans who are 35 and older grew up in a 
different america where they learned to love and appreciate their 
country either from school their own family or from the 
neighborhood from the father down the street who fought in korea or 
the family who lost someone at anzio

two public interest groups on thursday assailed 
a nuclear regulatory commission proposal that would exempt very 
lowlevel radioactive waste from federal regulations 
the nrc does not have the right to increase anyones 
involuntary risks said diane darrigo speaking for the nuclear 
information and resource service a washingtonbased group 
she contended that the commissions proposal ignores the 
growing number of health studies that indicate that low doses of 
radiation increase the health risks of those exposed 
the nrc has proposed to exempt from federal regulations lowlevel 
waste that would expose people to 10 millirems of radiation a year 
approximately the same amount of radiation involved in a wholemouth 
dental xray 
if finally adopted the new rule would enable atomic power plants 
and other users of nuclear materials to dispose of such lowlevel 
radioactive waste as ordinary refuse shipped to incinerators or land 
fills 
ms darrigo told an nrc staff panel at a public meeting in 
suburban bethesda md that part of the responsibility for using 
radioactive materials for any purpose is keeping them from harming 
or potentially harming anyone in this generation and in future 
generations 
those who operate nuclear power stations and those who produce 
radioactive consumer products must be required to do whatever it 
takes at whatever the cost to keep the radiation they generate out 
of the lives and environments of those who choose not to increase 
their risk by exposure she said 
also criticizing the proposed change was another antinuclear 
group the environmental coalition on nuclear power judith 
johnsrud speaking for the coalition asserted that all exposures 
to ionizing radiation may have deleterious genetic or somatic body 
effects 
on this issue she said prudence and conservatism are 
essential to serve the public interest 
speakers endorsing the nrc proposal included lauriston s taylor 
representing the health physics society an organization of 
physicians and scientists involved with radiation biology and 
medicine 
taylor said that extremely costly protective measures are 
currently required by regulatory control of very lowlevel 
radiation exposures that are believed to be well below the need of 
regulation 
if this is allowed to continue estimates of future costs in 
unnecessary parts of programs of waste management and site cleanup 
have been estimated to range into billions of dollars he said

president reagan will increase this fiscal 
years quota of soviet and eastern european refugees by 7000 by 
lowering the quota of vietnamese refugees many of whom are former 
political prisoners unable to emigrate the state department said 
thursday 
the decision brings to 25000 the number of soviets who will be 
permitted to enter this country while the added slots will be taken 
mostly from the quota for refugees from vietnam us officials 
stressed the president has considerable flexibility to alter the 
totals later on 
a high ceiling was set for vietnam with the expectation of a 
major exodus of vietnamese who had been detained in reeducation 
camps redman said but he said the united states was unable to 
reach an agreement with hanoi about processing as a result redman 
said the slots would be reallocated to eastern europe and the 
soviet union 
nearly 40000 slots are available for vietnamese he said 
there is no shortage of refugee or immigration numbers available 
to vietnamese who wish to emigrate to the us redman said the 
only shortages are the exit permits issued by vietnamese 
authorities 
last year only 2500 exit permits were issued in vietnam he 
said 
thousands of soviet refugees many of them jews are in vienna 
and rome waiting for permission to come to the united states and 
the quota for them to enter this country is full 
additionally in moscow an average of 100 applicants a day 
approach the us embassy redman said two employees of the us 
immigration and naturalization service would go to moscow to help 
handle the processing 
the reagan administration after pressuring the soviet union to 
step up jewish emigration has found itself in a paradoxical 
position 
the jewish exodus is at a nineyear high the united states finds 
itself unable to process all those who left the soviet union with 
exit permits for israel but who sought entry here once they reached 
vienna and rome 
the ceilings are not set in concrete a us official said 
wednesday demanding anonymity he explained that over the eight 
months left in the current fiscal year the ceilings can be adjusted 
by the president and congress to meet changing situations 
soviet jews were routinely admitted as political refugees but 
late last year the reagan administration required individuals to 
prove they were the specific victims of persecution otherwise they 
were forced to compete for the available slots with other refugees 
from the soviet union and eastern europe

a court on thursday ruled in 
favor of 500 black squatters from a tiny atlantic ocean town who 
have been fighting an eviction order for the past year 
cape town supreme court judge jh berman refused to give port 
nolloth municipal authorities the right to forcibly remove the 
squatters who live in shacks and tents 
such an order if granted contemplated the possibility of a 
forcible removal of a large number of women and children to be 
dumped in the desert immediately outside the boundaries of port 
nolloth without shelter berman said in his ruling 
port nolloth officials last year authorized themselves to remove 
the squatters saying there was no land in the town where blacks 
could live legally all residential areas in south africa are 
segregated by race and no black neighborhood has been established 
in port nolloth 
the black community however took the officials to court and won 
an interim order allowing them to stay prior to bermans ruling 
thursday 
port nolloth authorities have not said where they want the 
squatters to go the nearest black township is more than 300 miles 
away 
some of the blacks have lived in port nolloth since 1980 and 
additional squatters migrated from nearby namibia last year 
only a few thousand people live in port nolloth one of the few

a team of wool wizards clipped spun and 
wove their way to victory turning a sheeps wool into a shawl in 107 
minutes using techniques artisans used centuries ago 
we have a good team everybody worked well together 
breathless team captain carolyn peyser said wednesday night when the 
judges announced the winner in the pennsylvania farm shows sheep to 
shawl contest 
after buying the shawl for 1600 darryl breniser of blue ball 
said the approximately 2by5 foot shawl was worth the money 
it was a fair price he said they worked hard for it 
the team earned about 1495 per minute of work on the shawl 
the wool wizards of dauphin county beat out eight other teams of 
five 
the contest began when nine shearers armed with snapping electric 
razors unceremoniously hauled a sheep between their legs waited for 
the starting signal and began shaving the animal bald chris herr 
shearer for the winning wool wizards finished his sheep first in 
about 2 minutes 
the workers then carded the wool brushing it with paddles so the 
fibers lay in one direction worked it into yarn on a spinning 
wheel and finally wove it into a shawl on a wooden frame loom

the pentagon summoned its 
fourstar officers the marine band and a 21gun salute to stage an 
elaborate ceremony thursday for a departing commanderinchief but 
kept the cost a military secret 
with marines in camouflage battle dress standing by under the 
wing of an air force strategic bomber president reagan the 
military commanderinchief received a farewell salute from the 
nations armed forces and told the men and women in uniform you 
are americas pride 
at the ceremony in a new hangar built for the next air force one 
the presidential aircraft reagan stood mistyeyed as the marine 
band after playing the traditional marine hymn followed with a 
rendition of auld lang syne 
the unusual review was to have been held outdoors and include 
flyovers of 17 aircraft from all the services plus the coast guard 
it was forced inside by a chilly rain the flyovers were called off 
the cost of the patriotic farewell was as elusive as a military 
secret the pentagon had said wednesday that it could not estimate 
the cost at this time and would not count the expense of 
aircraft performances in any event 
since the flyby is being conducted using normal operational 
flying training hours no additional costs will be incurred by the 
services the pentagon said funding of the salute will be 
absorbed by each of the services it added 
first lady nancy reagan was also invited but stayed home because 
of laryngitis that has dogged her since before she and the president 
returned from a california vacation on jan 5 
reagan told the estimated 1400 government officials members of 
the armed services and other guests that the first lady who 
unfortunately is ill and has no voice tried to get up and get here 
and i sent her back to bed 
the 45minute ceremony began with the firing of a 21gun salute 
outside the hangar 
secretary of defense frank c carlucci then presented the 
department of defense medal for distinguished public service to the 
president telling him you have restored our nations pride in 
itself and the nations armed forces pride in our uniform 
carlucci also presented medals from the four armed services 
within the defense department as well as the coast guard 
adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
thanked the president for the legacy of strength you are leaving 
to our next commanderin chief after presidentelect bush takes 
over on jan 20 
reagan interrupted his own eightminute speech to lead the crowd 
in a moment of silence for 595 members of the armed services who 
have died in the line of duty in the last eight years 
they volunteered they chose to serve they gave their lives 
they are our heroes he said 
he did not call the moment of silence a prayer but he bowed his 
head closed his eyes and ended by saying amen 
addressing the living in the armed forces he said that the 
credit the gratitude of a nation comfortable and at peace 
properly goes not to me but rather to all of you 
you come from the southwest and the northeast from the rockies 
and adirondacks from the inner cities and the most remote of 
farms he said you come from america and you are americas 
pride 
over the last eight years the luster has been restored to the 
reputation of our fighting forces after a time during which it was 
shamefully fashionable to deride and even condemn service such as 
yours reagan told the assembly 
those days will never come again he said to thunderous 
applause 
but it is not just your fellow americans who owe you a debt 
the president said because we remained strong because we acted 
when we believed we had to in the last eight years not one inch of 
ground on this earth fell under communist control 
following his farewell address from the oval office wednesday 
night the salute was one of a series of sentimentladen events for 
the president that will culminate in his return to california as a 
private citizen next week 
to the left of the speakers on the platform in the 14story 
hangar marines in camouflage paint and fatigues flanked one of the 
air forces new b1b bombers 
elsewhere stood jet fighters helicopters an army m1a tank and 
one of the e4b aerial command post planes that stand by in case of 
war all part of the trilliondollar military buildup that reagan 
has made a point of pride in his administration 
carluccis predecessor caspar weinberger was on hand and 
greeted reagan as he sat down to watch a military review that began 
with a display by the armys colonial fife and drum corps dressed in 
revolutionary war garb and included a color guard of the combined 
armed services and coast guard 
every fourstar general and admiral was invited to attend

proposed cuts in next years school 
budget have unleashed a tempest of opposition with one 11yearold 
pupil reported to suggest that the finance minister should go hang 
himself 
expressen the countrys highestcirculation daily ran the quote 
in bold type it said it was quoting an 11yearold it identified as 
calle one of hundreds of students who wrote to the daily papers to 
complain of a proposed reductions in next years school budget 
education exploded into a political drama when finance minister 
kjellolof feldt one of swedens most popular leaders targeted 
schools for spending reductions in the 198990 budget package 
presented to parliament this week 
trimming the education budget was feldts latest move to hold the 
line on wages and put a lid on inflation now running at more than 6 
percent well above the european average 
swedens taxes have long been among the highest in the world and 
generous education benefits are a big part of what the taxes buy 
on wednesday 12000 primary and highschool students marched 
through downtown stockholm to parliament some climbed up on window 
ledges and overturned flowerpots chanting stop feldt 
opposition to feldts governing social democrats united in 
parliament and threatened to kill the budget legislation 
feldt said teachers salaries went up last year by more than the 
56 percent ceiling set by parliament and that schools should take 
into account a falling number of students 
primary school teachers salaries start at 1400 monthly and 
collegetrained teachers with 15 years of experience earn 2267 
near the average national income 
critics charge that the planned cut of 27 million from 
education or 05 percent of its budget ignored a crisis resulting 
from 10 years of insufficent government allocations 
they say school buildings are falling into disrepair tattered 
textbooks are handed from one class to the next and qualified 
teachers are abandoning education for betterpaid jobs in industry 
the protesters demand a limit of 20 pupils per class newer 
books better food in schools and a doubling of the monthly 
government stipend to each student from the current 78 
feldts proposals are part of his broad efforts to keep the 
swedish budget in shape in seven years as finance minister he has 
wiped out a huge annual deficit to give sweden its first surplus 
budget since 1962 often through policies that go against the 
socialist leanings of his party 
he has proposed a sweeping reform to simplify taxes plug 
deduction loopholes and reduce tax on overtime payments 
at the same time feldt has been unable to buck the tide in his 
party for more benefits and leisure time for workers 
the social democrats have promised six weeks annual vacation for 
everyone they have pledged to extend parental leave for new parents 
mother or father from nine months with full pay to 12 months 
this year and 18 months in 1990 
the school crisis has prompted claesgoran kjellander political 
editor of the conservative svenska dagbladet to question swedes 
favorable attitude toward feldt and his predecessors 
they raise our taxes they spend our money for unnecessary 
things and cut the grants for things we think are important this 
is repeated year after year the more its repeated the better we 
like them he wrote 
the pupil identified as calle was reported to hold other notions 
after feldt complained that expressen reached the lowest point 
of swedish journalism by using the schoolboy to attack his draft 
budget expressen put this response from calle on its front page 
hey kjellolof feldt you know you dont really have to hang 
yourself i only meant for example go throw yourself against a 
wall you are making a booboo

settlement before the feb 15 deadline for withdrawal of soviet 
forces

insistence that communists be included in a postwar government 
about 35 afghan refugees live in border camps and towns in 
pakistan which the insurgents use as bases and supply points 
reports in pakistani newspapers have said ms bhuttos government 
is trying for a resumption of negotiations to avoid more bloodshed 
after the soviets leave

since taking office dec 2 including a visit to mecca was a 
pilgrimage to offer prayers and thanksgiving to god for the 
restoration of democratic rule in pakistan 
her pakistan peoples party won the most parliament seats in the

the royal shakespeare company on wednesday 
announced plans for its biggest shakespeare year ever with 14 of the 
bards plays and shorter contracts for actors aimed at attracting 
more top talent 
terry hands the subsidized theaters artistic director unveiled 
a new oneyear twoseason work cycle under which actors will 
commit themselves to one 60week contract playing the first half of 
the season at the companys home theater in stratforduponavon 
before transferring the productions to its london base at the 
barbican 
this replaces the twoyear schedule in which actors had to make a 
twoyear commitment and spent one year at stratford and the second 
in london 
the system is meant to encourage actors to join the company by 
allowing them the flexibility to couple stage work with the more 
lucrative film and television assignments that make long runs in the 
theater possible 
its not a change in the basic policy its a continuing 
experiment said hands adding english actors do not like long 
runs 
hands declined to name names but said the old system had 
mitigated against getting those top talents who would not sign such 
a lengthy contract 
he said the company will present 27 plays in london and stratford 
the 1989 london season begins at the end of march with the 
transfers from stratford of last years mainstage and studio 
productions which included john wood as prospero in the tempest 
and a series of plays from and about the restoration period 
two new productions to open in july and september respectively 
will be revivals of george s kaufman and moss harts the man who 
came to dinner and henrik ibsens the master builder with 
wood playing the doomed visionary solness 
the spring stratford lineup begins april 11 with a midsummer 
nights dream and includes shakespeares cymbeline 
hamlet and romeo and juliet before those productions in 
turn transfer to london in november 
at that point two more productions enter the london repertory a 
stage adaptation of anthony burgesss novel a clockwork orange 
and have by hungarian writer julius hay 
the autumn sees a new stratford roster of as you like it 
alls well that ends well and antony and cleopatra 
besides wood actors announced for the upcoming season include 
such rsc veterans as harriet walter and brian cox and promising 
young talents such as mark rylance who will play hamlet and romeo 
and david ohara 
american playwright richard nelson who wrote the book for the 
shortlived broadway musical chess will open a new play some 
americans abroad in london in july 
other plans by the company include a sixweek european tour in 
february and march of the companys highly praised titus 
andronicus 
this year marks the first time in four years that the company has 
no musical on tap les miserables which opened at the barbican 
in 1985 is an ongoing worldwide hit but its revival of kiss me 
kate failed to transfer to the united states and its most recent 
musical carrie was a disaster closing on broadway after five 
performances in may

a new ulcer drug that is still being tested is 
superior to one of the mainstays of ulcer treatment because it 
promotes healing and relieves symptoms more quickly according to a 
new study 
the drug known generically as omeprazole was found to work 
better than zantac one of two widely used treatments for ulcers of 
the digestive system 
i have a good feeling about this drug it seems to be more 
effective said dr alain farley of mcgill university in montreal 
farley was among physicians at 45 institutions in 13 countries 
who compared omeprazole and zantac on 602 patients the results were 
published in thursdays issue of the new england journal of medicine 
farley said he expects the new drug to be approved for routine 
use in the united states and canada within the next year 
the latest study compared the two drugs in patients with stomach 
ulcers after one month of treatment ulcers had healed in 80 
percent of those getting omeprazole and 59 percent receiving zantac 
after two months 96 percent of the omeprazole patients and 85 
percent of the zantac patients had healed 
the drugs work by blocking the bodys secretion of hydrochloric 
acid but omeprazole does so far more completely than other drugs on 
the market 
an estimated 20 million americans get digestive ulcers they are 
holes in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum which is the 
upper part of the small intestine 
earlier studies have found omeprazole to be superior to tagamet 
the other commonly prescribed ulcer medicine in healing duodenal 
ulcers 
dr david graham of the veterans administration medical center in 
houston who has also studied the new drug said some experts are 
concerned about the longterm effects of shutting down acid 
secretion almost completely 
i think this drug actually is a step forward but its into 
some uncharted areas said graham only time will tell if that 
is best for patients 
he said that while omeprazole will probably be widely prescribed 
its still unclear whether it will become the drug of choice in the 
highly competitive market for ulcer remedies 
the latest study concluded that omeprazole is superior to 
ranitidine zantac in the treatment of benign gastric ulcer 
because it produced faster healing and gave more rapid relief of 
symptoms

former us officials seeking to erode support 
for israel in congress filed a complaint thursday against an 
influential proisrael lobby and 53 political action committees 
charging they had violated federal election laws 
the 100page complaint to the federal election commission was 
filed by onetime undersecretary of state george ball former 
ambassador to saudi arabia james akins former ambassador to qatar 
andrew killgore former illinois congressman paul findley and three 
others 
the complaint supported by more than two dozen exhibits alleges 
that the american israel public affairs committee aipac has 
overstepped its legal lobbying activities by targeting political 
candidates for election or defeat based on their positions toward 
israel 
the complainants further claimed that aipac channeled funds and 
volunteers to such campaigns in violation of its registered purpose 
as a lobbyist aipac has in the past denied such activities but 
declined to discuss the complaint citing fec regulations of 
confidentiality 
the complaint researched by a major arabamerican organization 
called the american arab antidiscrimination committee demands that 
the fec force aipac to register as a pac and disclose its activities 
such a ruling would hamper the effectiveness of the lobby which 
operates behind the scenes to recruit support for israel the 
largest recipient of us aid with 3 billion annually and to 
oppose weapons sales to arab foes of the jewish state 
aipacs formidable ability to mobilize congressional support 
is based not upon an appeal to the american national interest 
but upon threats by a special interest that has resorted to 
conspiracy and collusion said a statement by richard curtiss 
formerly the chief inspector of the us information agency and one 
of the plaintiffs 
but a brief statement by aipac said its members proudly 
participate in the american political process and do so within the 
law we are confident the fec will expeditiously concur 
curtiss and others have argued over the years that washingtons 
policy is skewed in israels favor to the detriment of us standing 
in the arab world both politically and economically 
aipac and its supporters contend that israel is the only stable 
democracy in the middle east and a vital ally for the united states 
in the volatile region they also point to broad support for israel 
in public opinion surveys 
there are only a handful of proarab pacs in the united states 
and they are outspent as much as 10to1 by the proisrael groups 
the complaint the first against aipac in its 15year history 
also charges that the lobby coordinates the activities of dozens of 
pacs and uses them to channel funds to candidates the complaint 
cites two internal aipac memos one of which urges a colleague to 
ensure that proisrael pacs channel contributions to certain senate 
candidates 
the petition also seeks to prove collusion between aipac and 53 
proisrael pacs through their common cause and an overlap of their 
officials 
it is not uncommon in washington for directors of pacs to be 
active on boards of special interest groups or corporations 
if the charge of collusion is accepted by the fec it could find 
that the pacs exceeded their contribution limits because the law 
treats all contributions by affiliated committees as though they 
were made by a single group 
the complaint which also demands that the fec order candidates 
to return such excessive contributions cited the 1988 rhode island 
senatorial race which the complaint contends was targeted by aipac

a mississippi legislator introduced a 
resolution thursday to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the 
slayings of three civil rights workers in 1964 
rep george flaggs jr said the resolution would put the state of 
mississippi on record in commemorating the june 21 1964 deaths 
of james earl chaney andrew goodman and michael schwerner 
none of the sites of significant events during the civil rights 
era bear state monuments including the site near philadelphia 
miss where the three slain civil rights workers were found buried 
in an earthen dam 
there is a monument to the three men at philadelphia but it was 
erected by the mississippi naacp 
talk about state markers has been fueled in recent weeks by the 
release of the movie mississippi burning a fictionalized 
account of the slayings and subsequent investigation 
we keep saying mississippi is changing said cleve mcdowell 
former field director for the state naacp but we dont do 
anything to show it 
a state marker would speak louder and show we actually have 
changed mcdowell said that would be a better indicator that 
mississippi is changing than anything else 
it was too early to assess reaction from the legislature flaggs 
issued a statement saying the three civil rights workers dedicated 
and sacrificed their lives for the benefit of others 
it is imperative that the citizens of this state recognize the 
humanist efforts which were demonstrated by those three courageous 
civil rights workers who believed in justice and equality for 
everyone regardless of race color or creed he said 
state historian michael beard said funding for state markers was 
lost in 1980 and has not been restored but he called the slayings 
the turning point in the civil rights movement and clearly favored 
commemorating them 
its one of the most historic sites in mississippi he said 
a marker he said would show we can recognize the truth and no 
longer cover it up we are no longer a closed society

the arab league on thursday condemned the 
us downing of two libyan jets jan 4 as a threat to all arab 
nations 
the 21nation arab league issued a statement of condemnation at 
the end of a special session in tunis called at the request of 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat 
addressed a league committee and berated arab colleagues for 
reneging on their promise of aid to the people of the israeli 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the resolution on the jet downing asked the united states to 
refrain from all actions against libya that could have negative 
consequences on arabamerican relations 
during the meeting libyan foreign minister jadallah azzouz talhi 
said us actions against his country were aimed at dissuading arab 
states from possessing arms that could threaten israel 
gadhafi requested the meeting of foreign ministers after two us 
navy planes downed the libyan jets which american officials say 
were about to attack the us craft 
the united states says the action was unrelated to concern that 
libya has built a plant for making chemical weapons 
the plant which libya says is for producing medicine was a main 
topic at a fiveday international conference this week in paris on 
banning chemical weapons 
the us has the biggest stock of chemical arms in the world 
and it is trying to obstruct other countries from having their 
own said arab league secretarygeneral chedli klibi 
the conference ended without agreement on a ban 
arab league members who attended sought to tie chemical 
disarmament to nuclear disarmament they said that until israel 
gives up its nuclear force arab states need chemical arms for 
defense 
the arab position was not included in the final document 
arafat spoke to the leagues uprising subcommittee of six foreign 
ministers that has been responsible for ensuring support for 
palestinians in the occupied territories he charged the group with 
neglecting its responsibility 
the exact amount of aid promised is not known but is generally 
believed to be about 128 million in emergency aid and 43 million 
in additional help each month 
arafat first began complaining about a lack of aid at a june 
meeting in algiers that was dedicated to organising financial and 
diplomatic support for palestinians 
the committee issued a statement urging league members to adhere 
to their promises

the government released more than 200 
political prisoners thursday after newly elected president 
ranasinghe premadasa lifted a 5year state of emergency in this 
ethnically troubled land the military said 
i still dont know why i was brought here said jeffrey 
simon 39 as he left tyronne fernando cricket stadium a temporary 
military camp in moratuwa about six miles south of colombo 
rupasinghe padmasiri the father of another prisoner said my

involvement with the sinhalese extremists he said his 28yearold 
son panduka was arrested while buying groceries 
military officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 234 
political prisoners were freed after the emergency rules were lifted 
at midnight 
the rules were imposed in may 1983 after ethnic riots between the 
sinhalese majority and tamils who are fighting for independence 
extended month by month they empowered security forces to arrest 
and indefinitely detain a suspect without charge and to search 
houses without warrants 
when the president revoked the emergency state three days before 
it was again to expire he said about 1800 political prisoners 
detained without charge would be released 
within hours 110 prisoners were freed at a detention camp in 
southern sri lanka the military said ninetynine were released 
from the moratuwa camp and 25 others were allowed to leave a prison 
in colombo it said 
all had been held without charge since november for alleged 
involvement with sinhalese extremists trying to overthrow the 
government said one military official each signed a statement 
before leaving prison saying he had been treated well and would not 
bring charges against security forces the official said 
military officials said other prisoners would be released later 
but gave no details the detainees include both sinhalese and tamils 
accused of violence against the state and assassinations of 
government legislators police and soldiers

supporters mostly sinhalese have been killed by sinhalese 
extremists they oppose former president junius r jayewardenes

studies at five medical centers show that 
acyclovir an antiviral drug can reduce or eliminate recurrent 
outbreaks of genital herpes even when taken for more than a year a 
researcher said thursday 
dr david baker a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology at the 
state university of new york stony brook said a doubleblind study 
involving 261 patients with active herpes infections showed that 
outbreaks of the disease were virtually eliminated for about half of 
those taking acyclovir twice daily 
these were all patients who before had had about one recurrence 
of herpes a month and had been infected for more than a year 
baker said in a telephone interview 
he said half of the 261 patients in the study received 400 
milligrams of acyclovir twice a day for a year while the other half 
received only a placebo 
for those who took the active drug daily about half 46 
percent had no recurrence of herpes outbreak at all during the 
year said baker in the other half who took the drug the 
recurrences were very mild and they lasted a day instead of five 
days as before he said 
members of the active drug group averaged 18 recurrences for the 
whole year 
in the placebo group said baker there was virtually no change 
in the frequency of the outbreaks 
he said those in the placebo group each averaged 85 herpes 
episodes over 12 months and only five percent of this group 
experienced no episode 
genital herpes is caused by a virus that generally is spread 
through sexual contact in which one partner has open lesions of the 
disease herpes infects the genital tract of both men and women and 
will periodically cause infected lesions on genital surfaces for 
some infected with the disease these episodes can be very painful 
frequent and continue for years for others the pain and formation 
of lesions may occur only once and then not reappear 
for 20 to 30 percent of those infected said baker the 
outbreaks are very frequent occurences that continue for many 
years 
he said patients used in the study were selected from a 
population that has lots of trouble with herpes 
although earlier studies showed that acyclovir was effective 
temporarily against herpes baker said the doubleblind trial was 
the first to demonstrate that the antiviral drug is effective over 
many months 
the trial shows that if you have a population that has frequent 
recurrences you can treat them for a long period of time and it is 
safe and it works said baker 
in addition to stony brook the study trials were conducted at 
st johns mercy medical center in st louis baylor college of 
medicine houston the university of hawaii honolulu and in 
montreal 
a report on the study was published this month in the journal 
obstetrics and gynecology a journal of the american college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists

gail light said thursday 
the stabbing occurred at a service station in jackson where 
jones stopped for gas on his way to work police said pitts a guard 
at the cotton regional facility in jackson followed jones to the 
service station and stabbed him with a 6inch knife when he got out 
of his car 
jones was treated at a hospital and released 
corrections officials believe the key was lost during an argument 
between the two dec 17 in pitts apartment 
jones was found naked and struggling with the knifewielding 
pitts who had summoned police according to police reports 
he left the womans apartment after receiving a change of 
clothing corrections officials believe the key to the 470bed 
prison was lost in his original clothing 
pitts said she had been involved in an eightyear affair with 
jones who is married according to court records jones said pitts 
who has been suspended from her job and faces felony charges in the 
stabbing incident was caught in a fatal attractiontype

presidentelect bush said thursday that he 
would not advocate government action to curtail corporate takeovers 
but suggested a review of tax laws might be needed to guard against 
abuses 
i am not in favor of the government picking winners and 
losers bush said at a news conference called to announce his 
final cabinet choices 
bush was asked if he planned any action to put the brakes on the 
increasing number of takeovers many through socalled leveraged 
buyouts 
you are talking to one who would as much as possible rely on 
market forces bush replied 
in a leveraged buyout an investment group borrows heavily to buy 
out stockholders and take over the target company sometimes such 
buyouts are proposed by managers seeking to thwart a hostile 
takeover 
the companys new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of 
the company to pay back loans critics of the practice fear that 
high debt levels particularly in a recession could endanger both 
the boughtout company and the financiers of the transaction 
bush said that if there are abuses of our tax laws the 
whole tax law will be reviewed to see how they can be eliminated 
the vice president did not elaborate but hinted that his 
administration might examine changes in tax laws to make clearer the 
distinction between debt and equity

a group of 76 burmese students flew home 
thursday from thailand where the prime minister was reported to 
reject charges of earlier forced repatriations 
the latest return brought to 260 the number who have come home 
since the repatriation program began dec 26 thai officials said 
thousands of students at the forefront of prodemocracy protests 
through much of last year fled to thai border areas controlled by 
antigovernment guerrillas after gen saw maung seized power in a 
coup sept 18 and his troops killed hundreds of demonstrators 
two burmese aircraft took the latest group of students from a 
processing center in the northern city of tak to burmas capital 
rangoon the students were seen off by the tak governor and thai red 
cross officials and welcomed aboard the planes by burmese military 
officers 
fortyfour more students will return the same way friday 
officials say they will be accompanied by thai and foreign 
journalists invited by the thai military to try to dispel charges 
that the students were being forced back to face harsh treatment by 
burmese authorities 
thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan rejected as absolutely 
untrue charges by amnesty international a human rights group 
that thailand forcibly repatriated 22 students who flew from tak to 
rangoon on jan 6 thai newspapers reported thursday 
speaking with reporters wednesday chatichai was quoted as saying 
he tore up the telexed statement with the charges from the 
londonbased group as soon as he saw it 
he suggested amnesty was interfering in thailands affairs but 
he said it and other humanitarian groups were welcome to observe the 
repatriations of the students 
we didnt force them back and they all smiled happily when 
boarding the planes he said according to the nation newspaper 
thailand is a developing country in asia so it is normal that 
those european countries like to think that we are still 
barbarians he was quoted as saying 
thai military officers in charge of the repatriation program also 
have strongly denied amnestys charges 
the amnesty statement received in bangkok on wednesday said 
concern for the students safety was based on increasing 
evidence that many burmese arrested for involvement in the 
demonstrations have been held without charge or trial it cited 
evidence that some were tortured 
the groups statement said the 22 of the shan ethnic minority 
were rounded up by thai police two weeks ago in mae hong son 
province bordering burma 
the statement said they are said to have repeatedly expressed 
fears for their safety and to have petitioned the thai authorities 
not to be returned to burma and eventually went on a hunger strike 
they are understood to have been forced to board a plane from tak 
airport on jan 6 1989 by thai army personnel 
the group said 14 students detained with them are believed still 
held at tak airport pending similar repatriation 
reporters who accompanied the 22 students on the flight quoted 
them as expressing concern for their safety in burma 
thailand at first promised the students temporary asylum but 
thai army chief gen chavalit yongchaiyudh visited burma on dec 14 
and reached an agreement with saw maung to repatriate the students 
thai officials have said about 7000 remain at the border

opting for education over earrings two 
brothers gave in to their principal thursday and agreed to take off 
their earrings during school hours but their parents say theyll 
continue to fight the order 
terry sunderland a junior at albany r3 high school and his 
brother jeremy snow a seventhgrader returned to classes for the 
first time in the week since the controversy started 
id like to wear my earring but i dont want to flunk said 
jeremy i take mine off as i enter the school and put it back on 
as i leave the door 
principal jim newman said the brothers would have flunked all 
their courses for the quarter if they had accumulated seven 
unexcused absences 
newman banned earrings for boys on jan 4 after an outbreak of 
namecalling and pushing and shoving between boys who wore earrings 
and those who didnt 
he gave eight boys who wore earrings the next day the option of 
taking them off or leaving two boys stayed in school the other 
six including terry and jerry left but eventually returned to 
class 
newman said the schools dress code gives administrators the 
discretion to ban things that would be disruptive to the 
educational process 
but the brothers parents lanny and carla sunderland argue that 
their sons are victims not perpetrators they said they intend to 
explore legal action against the school 
they didnt start the trouble and now they are being punished 
unfairly mrs sunderland said its sexual discrimination if 
the boys cant wear em then the girls cant 
sunderland a truck driver had his own ear pierced and now wears 
an earring himself in a show of solidarity with his sons 
i was outraged he said i did it in the belief of standing 
up for my boys and what they believe in thats why im pushing it

the communist party on thursday unveiled a campaign 
platform that promises a higher soviet standard of living but 
acknowledges that some of president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
are skidding 
nearly four years after launching an ambitious modernization 
program to raise living standards and open its longclosed society 
to public scrutiny the party said the economy has not yet begun 
to operate in a new way people have not yet come to feel fully the 
results of restructuring 
the expectations raised by perestroika gorbachevs reform 
program are far from being met the platform said progress in 
some areas including the social sphere is skidding 
the platform was adopted by the central committee at a plenary 
meeting on tuesday and published in full by tass on thursday 
at the same meeting the leadership picked gorbachev and 99 other 
top officials of the ruling party to run for election to the partys 
100 seats in the congress of peoples deputies 
despite a new election law allowing an unlimited number of 
candidates to participate in the march 26 election the move 
guaranteed the top communist leaders uncontested seats in the new 
2250member parliament which will elect the nations president and 
a fulltime legislature 
the partys first priority is a solution to the most acute 
issue the food problem the platform said but it offered few 
clues to how it would accomplish that saying only that the central 
committee soon will hold another plenary session to take steps to 
meet the populations requirements for foodstuffs more quickly 
meat butter sugar and other staples are rationed throughout 
much of the country and are in short supply elsewhere even in the 
national capital where there are numerous complaints in newspapers 
and on the streets that the food situation is worse now than when 
gorbachev assumed power in march 1985 
the party also conceded people continue to wait for a 
sufficient amount of highquality industrial goods to appear on

the national geographic society on thursday 
unveiled a massive 35foot globe the centerpiece in geographica a 
hightech multimedia science and geography exhibition two years 
away from being finished 
lady bird johnson pressed a button to turn on the 1550pound 
globe repeating her effort 25 years ago when she helped dedicate 
the original globe and display in explorers hall at the magazines 
headquarters 
mrs johnson congratulated the society for its efforts to 
illuminate our understanding that the entire world is one 
society 
the new globe with a circumfrance of 35 feet is composed of 
54739 square inches of epoxy resin and fiberglas cloth painted in 
painstaking detail by artist john bonner who spent 3127 hours 
highlighting vegetation deserts national boundaries and undersea 
features 
the globe is lifted on a cushion of air and can be rotated so any 
portion can face the audience lights display the movement of 
sunlight and shadow around the world 
occasionally work had to be sanded off and changed in progress 
bonner said for example a visiting indian official who saw the 
work informed the society that an area shown as a swamp had dried up 
into a salt lake so it was changed 
and the configuration of the antarctic ice shelf had to be redone 
after a giant iceberg broke off 
geographic officials did take one precaution to save work in the 
event of political changes national boundaries were applied with 
automotive pinstripe tape so that they can be relocated if necessary 
the renovated exhibition area includes a 72seat theater a 
weather display including satellite readouts and a tornado in a 
tube video shows depicting exotic cultures and both rare and common 
animals 
while the exhibit wont be finished for two years the societys 
president gilbert m grosvenor said the public will be admitted 
starting saturday to see the many displays already in operation

us airlines began testing thursday for faulty 
engine warning systems in boeing 737 airliners similar to one that 
crashed in england a spokesman for one us carrier said 80 percent 
of its 737s had been tested with no problems found 
officials of other airlines said they were complying with the 
testing as a precautionary measure but expected to find no faulty 
wiring of fire and vibration warning lights that might mislead a 
pilot into shutting down his only good engine if the other one 
showed problems 
that is one possibility being investigated in england where a 
british midland 737 crash killed 44 people sunday investigators 
said the pilot was trying to land with his malfunctioning left 
engine after his good right engine was shut down 
tests on britishowned planes were completed thursday under a 
civil aviation authority order that grounded them until the systems 
were checked out no problems were reported 
the us federal aviation administration air worthiness 
directive issued late wednesday did not order any us planes 
grounded it gave airlines with 292 boeing 737300s and eight 
737400s until sunday morning to conduct checks for possible 
crosswiring each test takes about an hour 
the british agency also ordered increased inspections of cfm56 
engines on the planes but the faa had not taken that step faa 
officials identified the affected airlines as aloha america west 
american continental delta orion piedmont southwest united and 
us air 
we found no anomalies or discrepancies said continental 
spokesman david messing in houston reporting on inspections 
conducted by thursday afternoon he said 80 percent of the 55 boeing 
737300s flown by continental had been checked and the rest would be 
finished overnight 
he said no flights were affected by the checks 
united spokeswoman sara dornacker in chicago said the airline 
supported the faa action even though we regard it as 
precautionary 
she said all of uniteds fleet of 49 affected airliners had been 
tested for possible crosswiring by test pilots after delivery from 
the boeing factory 
united inspections were to be conducted thursday friday and 
saturday nights at airports around the country she said 
american spokesman jim brown said inspections of some of the 
airlines eight 737s were conducted thursday and the remainder 
would take place before sunday 
we have no reason to expect discovery of any abnormalities in 
these systems brown said

at least 6000 people starved to death in 
southern sudan in the past three months but international airlifts 
of food and medicine have improved the situation a red cross

there were unconfirmed reports of 15 people dying there every day 
no relief aid has reached the upper nile 
beuff said between last september and december about 6000 
people have died in the south of the sudan but that is not the case 
anymore people suffer but they are not dying the situation is 
still not under control but it is better than last year 
since the civil war began nearly 2 million southerners have fled 
fighting in the countryside trekking northward or going to 
governmentcontrolled towns where they became dependent on relief 
food 
western relief officials estimate up to 560000 southerners died 
from starvation disease or fighting in 1988 
rebels led by john garang a former army colonel are fighting 
for greater autonomy for the south most of whose people are 
christian or animist from moslemdominated northern sudan 
last summer tens of thousands of southerners were isolated by 
heavy rains and thousands died of starvation 
when the rains ended several international airlifts started 
flying food and medicine to the towns in the bahr elghazal and 
equatoria regions several operations by the red cross and united 
nations continue

a judge dismissed trespassing charges 
thursday against 125 abortion protesters arrested during a 
demonstration outside an abortion clinic 
city judge joseph figliola said the police complaint forms lodged 
nov 19 the day of the protest and subsequent affidavits filed by 
prosecutors are completely barren of proof that the protesters 
knew they were on private property without permission or that they 
were told to leave the clinic grounds 
the judge said he found no evidence that would support efforts to 
force the protesters to stand trial 
the judge apparently left the door open for prosecutors either to 
appeal his ruling or try to file new complaints 
the 125 antiabortion protesters had been cited for allegedly 
trespassing on the grounds of a clinic operated by dr parvis taefi 
of buffalo

assistant secretary of state elliott abrams 
claimed thursday that el salvadors leftist rebels have had to 
resort to a campaign of terror against civilian targets because 
of declining popular support and increased resistance from the 
countrys armed forces 
abrams in a speech at the university of oklahoma said the 
rebels have assassinated eight mayors in recent months prompting 35 
other mayors to resign 
denied success in the countryside the guerrillas have embarked 
on a campaign of terror in the cities said abrams whose remarks 
were made available by the state department 
the rebels have met greater resistance from the armed forces and 
have had difficulty recruiting forcing them to press men indeed 
children into a dirty war he said 
these are the tactics of a marginalized force driven to 
extremes by desperation said abrams whose 3year service as 
head of the latin america bureau will end next week with the 
inauguration of presidentelect bush 
he expects to practice law after spending about two months with 
the heritage foundation a conservative research group 
summing up what he described as the eightyear legacy of 
president reagan in latin america abrams praised the democratic 
gains in the hemisphere and touched only briefly on the regions 
debtinduced economic crisis which has led to declining living 
standards in most countries 
the return of economic growth he said will depend upon a 
pragmatic openended search for solutions among creditors and 
debtors coming together as partners realizing their common stake 
in the outcome 
abrams also was sparing his in remarks on nicaragua his major 
area of concern since his appointment in 1985 
the nicaragua that chose to become part of the soviet bloc was 
not democratic abrams said a democratic nicaragua would have 
no use for a standing army of intimidating dimensions real peace in 
central america depends on the prospects for democratization in 
nicaragua 
he made no reference to the nicaraguan contras who have had 
unswerving support from abrams 
expressing confidence that el salvadors fledgling democracy will 
be able to ride out the rebel challenge he said the electoral 
process which began in that country six years ago led to a marked 
improvement in the security situation there 
as the people voted in record numbers to put civilian leaders 
in charge the military freed to meet its professional challenge 
began to reverse the progress made by the guerrillas 
at the same time a people who could see the prospects for 
peaceful change under elected governments could only reject the 
violence of the guerrillas as gratuitous and regressive

china has agreed to meet with vietnam 
next month for their first direct talks on the cambodian conflict a 
cambodian resistance official said 
the meeting will be held at the request of the soviet union 
which also plans direct talks with resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk said sihanouks son and representative in thailand prince 
norodom ranariddh 
ranariddh made the disclosures in a broadcast over the resistance 
radio wednesday a text was obtained thursday 
china supplies arms to the forces of sihanouk and two other 
guerrilla groups in the war against sovietsupplied vietnamese 
forces which invaded cambodia in late 1978 
asked about the reported chinesevietnamese meeting thai foreign 
minister siddhi savetsila said on his return thursday from vietnam 
that he knew of it but could not divulge details 
at a regular chinese foreign ministry briefing in beijing on 
thursday spokesman li zhaoxing would say only that china will 
consider direct talks with vietnam at an appropriate time he 
refused to elaborate 
both the soviet union and china have indicated they want to 
resolve the cambodian conflict and thus clear a major barrier to 
sinosoviet rapprochement 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze is to visit china 
next month to pave the way for the first chinesesoviet summit in 30 
years chinese television reported monday 
in the resistance broadcast ranariddh said the soviet union 
which is to withdraw its last troops from afghanistan next month if 
it adheres to a unbrokered accord certainly will not continue to 
bankroll the vietnamese forces in cambodia 
moreover as it is currently working to improve its relations 
with the united states and especially china the soviet union just 
cannot continue to help vietnam occupy cambodia he said 
he added moreover i have learned that the soviet union has 
asked china to agree to negotiate with vietnam if the prc peoples 
republic of china accepts this soviet proposal the soviet union 
will call directly on norodom sihanouk 
and i have just learned that the prc agreed to receive 
vietnams minister or deputy minister of foreign affairs early next 
february he said 
based on all these points it is not possible for vietnam to 
maintain the presence of its troops in cambodia 
ranariddh gave no details on the reported meeting 
china and vietnam once allies fought a brief but bloody border 
war in 1979 after vietnams invasion of cambodia they still 
periodically report border skirmishes 
vietnam has made a series of peace overtures to china in recent 
years but vietnamese officials say the chinese have rejected them 
and demanded first the unconditional withdrawal of vietnamese troops 
from cambodia 
in beijing thursday spokesman li repeated chinas position that 
the key to the solution of the cambodian conflict lies in the 
genuine and complete vietnamese troop withdrawal at the earliest 
possible date and effective international supervision 
there is fear however that the strongest cambodian resistance 
group the communist khmer rouge might seize power after a 
vietnamese pullout and resume the ruthless repression that colored 
its rule of the country from 1975 until the vietnamese invasion 
during that time an estimated 2 million of cambodias 8 million 
people died from khmer rouge executions famine and civil unrest 
vietnam has said it will totally withdraw by 1990 whether there 
is a settlement or not vietnam says it withdrew 50000 troops last 
year leaving another 50000 in cambodia

many college women raped by their dates or 
acquaintances dont report the attacks because they blame themselves 
for losing control a conference studying violence on the nations 
campuses was told 
in addition many women fail to realize they have become victims 
of rape or attempted rape and seldom report the attacks even to 
their friends experts said 
what happens is that a guy pays for dinner the movies and he 
thinks you get what you get in marriage they see it as a mini 
quasimarriage said laura x director of the national 
clearinghouse on marital and date rape i dont think were 
getting rid of date rape until we get rid of that concept 
in such cases women because of their upbringing often blame 
themselves for being unable to control the situation said ms x 
who said she uses the x to protest the lack of attention given to 
womens historical role 
about 250 psychologists counselors law enforcement officers 
students and others attended this weeks third national conference 
on campus violence here the conference began tuesday and ended 
thursday 
several reports discussed at the conference indicated that from 
13 percent to 25 percent of college women become victims of rape or 
attempted rape 
as many as one in four female college students have been raped or 
have been victims of attempted rape by the time they reach the age 
of 21 according to a survey conducted on 32 campuses by ms 
magazine the national institute for mental health and psychologist 
mary p koss 
the survey of 3187 female and 3000 male college students 
randomly selected in the 198586 school year found only 27 percent 
of the women deemed to have been victims of rape or attempted rape 
considered themselves crime victims the study found 84 percent of 
the rape victims knew their assailants but only 5 percent told 
police they had been attacked 
experts blamed the nonreporting on a rape culture that holds 
women primarily responsible for the outcome of relationships with 
men even when theyre overpowered 
lt cathy atwell who directs the university of maryland campus 
polices date rape prevention program said no rape reports were 
filed with campus police in 1988 and only three were filed the 
previous year some 38000 students attend the college park campus 
many colleges and universities have started rape prevention 
programs a leader in the effort is ohio state university which 
instituted its rape education and prevention program in response to 
an alleged gang rape 
sue green coordinator of the ohio state effort said her program 
teaches women to recognize a potential date rapist and teaches them 
how to fend off an attack 
carole corcoran who runs a rape prevention program at mary 
washington college in virginia said the key to prevention is 
teaching college men that forcing sex on a woman during a date 
constitutes rape 
until men are more receptive ms corcorans program stresses 
empowering strategies including selfdefense courses she also 
suggests women use a buddy system where one woman agrees to stay 
sober and make sure the other steers clear of trouble

the odds of becoming a murder victim are five 
times greater for nonwhite males born now than for the overall 
population of the united states the fbi said thursday 
americans born today have a 1 out of 177 chance of being 
murdered while the risk for nonwhite males is 1 in 38 according 
to the study based on 1987 uniform crime reporting statistics added 
to a computer model 
if there were no murders the average lifespan for all americans 
would increase by almost 3 months and the average lifespan for 
nonwhite males would increase by more than 11 months the study 
found 
sharon propheter a statistician with the uniform crime reporting 
program cautioned the predictions are based on 1987 figures and do 
not account for the possibility of substantial changes in the murder 
rates 
we cant look into the future and say there are going to be so 
many murders in 1999 said propheter who compiled the report with 
statistician harvey rosenthal this is based on what happened in 
1987 
in 1987 when the murder rate was 83 per 100000 population 
there were an estimated 20100 murders of those 9510 were 
nonwhite 7436 of them nonwhite males 
the study which calculated the probabilities of being murdered 
for newborns those age 20 and those age 40 did not break down the 
nonwhite category for blacks hispanics and other minorities 
propheter said 
the study predicted that while newborn nonwhite males have a one 
in 38 chance of becoming a murder victim the chance for nonwhite 
females is one in 138 for both sexes the chance is one in 60 
for newborn white males the chance is one in 204 while for 
white females its one in 437 for a combined chance of one in 277 
for newborns of all races the chance of being murdered is one in 
122 for males one in 324 for females and one in 177 for both sexes 
as for men who already have reached age 20 nonwhites have a one 
in 41 chance of being murdered while whites have a one in 224 
chance for an overall chance of one in 136 
for females who are now 20 nonwhites have a one in 157 
likelihood of being murdered and whites have a one in 504 chance 
for a total probability of one in 376 
the least likely to be murdered among the ages calculated by 
the fbi are white women who are now 40 they have only a one in 
931 chance of being murdered of all the groups now 40 the highest 
probability of being murdered remains nonwhite males with a one in 
97 chance 
the overall murder rate in the united states has leaped 34 
percent between 1967 and 1987 the fbi reported in the past 10 
years the highest rate was 102 per 100000 population in 1980 and 
the lowest was 79 per 100000 in 1984 and 1985 the 1987 rate of 
83 per 100000 compares with 25 per 100000 in canada 
in 1987 367 percent of murders resulted from arguments and 
196 percent occurred in connection with felonies such as robbery 
narcotics sex offenses and arson said chris waskiewicz an editor 
with the uniform crime reporting unit 
meanwhile 11 percent occurred from suspected felonies 177 
were miscellaneous including such things as the assailant being 
under the influence of alcohol or drugs and the circumstances for 
249 percent are unknown she said

lech walesa said thursday the people are 
angry and trouble is in store unless a communist party central 
committee meeting next week does something to improve living 
conditions 
walesa a shipyard electrician who founded the independent 
solidarity union movement in 1980 said poles are restive and fed up 
with high prices and shortages 
we hope for gods sake that this plenum will go a little bit 
farther than its own nose he told a news conference in gdansk 
if it doesnt it will be like a shout of encouragement to society 
and to us all and i dont know where we will end up 
i appeal for getting out in front of societys demands if not 
im really afraid 
the meeting monday and tuesday of the 230member central 
committee is expected to produce confrontation between conservatives 
and those willing to recognize solidarity and negotiate with the 
opposition 
solidarity was legal after its birth in the labor turmoil of 
august 1980 as the first free trade union in the soviet bloc it was 
suppressed and outlawed after the imposition of martial law in 
december 1981 
walesa said solidarity wants to avoid unrest 
we want it to be quiet both for the side of solidarity and 
the government to get ready for talks for attempts at 
solutions he said so weve given plenty of time 
unfortunately i am worried because there have been more and 
more days but no more solutions there are price hikes but 
there is a lack of effect of reforms society is so tired so 
fed up with it 
he said he had expected protests to begin in april if nothing was 
done but it may happen sooner lets hope we can avoid it poland 
really doesnt need it 
a rally of several thousand solidarity supporters was held 
tuesday at the lenin shipyard in gdansk where walesa works he 
mentioned that during the news conference along with minor work 
stoppages or strike threats at various plants in the past few weeks 
in an appeal for unity he said if we start jumping out in 
different places over different problems it will be anarchy and it 
will be a reason that may be used to strike against the unions 
mainstream to break dissolve and destroy it

president reagan on thursday recommended 
spending 81 billion over 20 years to modernize the governments 
crippled nuclear arms factories and to begin cleaning up the 
nationwide trail of waste left by four decades of bombmaking 
presidentelect bush said he did not know whether he would 
support the proposal which was prepared by the energy department 
the plan includes closing four nuclear materials plants 
consolidating work at other facilities and building two reactors to 
make a radioactive gas vital to continued production of nuclear 
warheads 
reagan in a report to congress said the blueprint will enable 
the administration and the congress to adopt a longterm approach to 
modernization rather than a piecemeal response to the problems 
within the nuclear weapons complex 
the cost of modernizing the aging weaponsmaking plants through 
the year 2010 would be at least 52 billion the report said 
cleanup costs over that period would total 29 billion although the 
report said environmental repairs would have to continue far beyond 
2010 there are 17 major plants in 12 states 
these figures are in addition to normal operating costs over the 
next 20 years which combined with the modernizing and cleanup 
costs would total 244 billion 
the cost estimates underscore the difficulties facing the 
incoming bush administration which has pledged to maintain the 
nations nuclear deterrent while protecting the environment and 
cutting government spending to balance the budget 
coincidentally reagan sent his recommendations to congress on 
the same day that bush nominated retired adm james d watkins to 
head the energy department which is responsible for developing 
building and testing the nations nuclear warheads 
bush told a news conference he did not feel bound by the 
recommendations in reagans report and indicated he would make no 
decisions on the weapons plants problem until after he and watkins 
had studied the security implications 
i think theres a risk if we imprudently go forward until he 
and i have had a chance to take a hard look bush said 
watkins was trained in nuclear engineering during a 1958 stint at 
oak ridge tenn national laboratory one of the militaryrelated 
nuclear weapons facilities 
concern over the nuclear weapons complex heightened last fall 
after the last of the nations tritiumproducing reactors at the 
savannah river plant near aiken sc was shut down for safety 
reasons tritium is a shortlived gas that is vital in nearly all 
us nuclear warheads pentagon officials have expressed concern 
that unless at least one tritiummaking reactor is restarted soon 
the nations nuclear arsenal could be weakened 
reagans report to congress said it was unlikely the savannah 
river reactors would be operating before the end of the year the 
unclassified version released publicly did not say whether that 
would be soon enough to avoid a tritium shortage 
it appeared to suggest however that even after costly safety 
and technical improvements the savannah river facilities would be 
unable to supply enough tritium 
in spite of these improvements and increasingly extensive 
maintenance the reactors may not be able to achieve acceptable 
production efficiencies the report said 
the report specifically recommended 
investing 400 million to improve safety and technical 
operations at the rocky flats plutoniumprocessing plant near 
denver colo and then spending 61 billion to close down the 
plant and transfer its operations to other sites 
phasing out all nuclear materialsprocessing work at the hanford 
plant near richland wash between 1995 and 2000 a cost estimate 
was not made available this plant opened in 1944 was one of three 
original manhattan project sites responsible for producing 
plutonium including the material used in the bomb that destroyed 
nagasaki 
shutting down the feed materials production center at fernald 
ohio and shifting its operations elsewhere the report gave no 
specific cost figure and did not say where the fernald activities 
should be moved this plant which makes uranium metal cores used in 
nuclear reactors at savannah river and hanford has drawn fierce 
public opposition due to leaks of uranium dust into the atmosphere 
and toxic chemicals and uranium into wells used for drinking water 
transferring the nuclear wasterecovery operations of the mound 
plant near cincinnati to other unspecified energy department 
weapons plants at a cost of 255 million starting in 1995 the 
plants main work producing small explosive devices and timers for 
nuclear weapons would continue at the same site 
building two new nuclear reactors to produce tritium the report 
said the preferred sites would be at savannah river and at the idaho 
national engineering laboratory near idaho falls it estimated the 
combined cost at 66 billion

a canadian cargo plane crashed and exploded 
in a fireball near a row of houses thursday killing the two pilots 
aboard and setting nearby woods afire authorities said 
we thought we were dead thats how close it was said dewey 
meade who was in his home a few hundred yards from the crash site 
weve got debris all over the roof and everything 
no one on the ground was injured and no homes suffered serious 
damage 
bruce jonasson manager of bradley first air said pilots from 
montreal and ottawa were the planes only occupants jonasson 
declined to release their names until families had been notified 
a small quantity of explosive and corrosive materials were aboard 
the plane but they posed no environmental hazard jonasson said 
the twinengine plane took off from dayton international airport 
and crashed at 445 am in a heavily wooded area about a halfmile 
away said james francis acting aviation director for dayton 
meade described it as a fireball coming right at the side of my 
house 
the explosion set fire to about 100 yards of wooded area said 
lt jim bowell of the butler township fire department several 
witnesses reported seeing a fireball in the air before the crash 
several hours after the crash broken limbs and branches 
surrounded the smoldering wreckage and small fires continued to 
burn although they were later extinguished boxes and other cargo 
littered the area 
two bodies were discovered at the site one in the wreckage of 
the hawkersiddley turboprop and the other nearby said gene brown 
chief investigator for the montgomery county coronors office 
the plane owned by bradley first air of ottawa canada was 
carrying cargo to montreal for emery air freight corp an air 
freight courier service with a hub at the dayton airport it was at 
least 9 years old 
airport officials said they were unsure how long the aircraft was 
in the air following takeoff 
gary hess an emery employee saw the plane go down as he was 
getting off work at the airport 
it was kind of like just going across the horizon and then it 
just blew he said it was just a big ball of fire 
joe weitz another emery employee said the plane appeared to 
burst into flame shortly after it cleared the runway

a cockpit recorder recovered by an underwater 
robot from the yearold wreckage of a south african airways boeing 
747 nearly three miles deep in the indian ocean could provide the 
latest clue in a 6 million effort to determine cause of the crash 
that killed 159 people 
the recorders tape recovered from the ocean last week was 
taken thursday by south african investigators to the national 
transportation safety board where it was copied for use by the 
investigators 
safety board officials said they only provided equipment for 
processing the tape and would have no role in playing transcribing 
or analysing it the unites states is providing the technical 
assistance at the request of the south african government 
meanwhile search continues in the indian ocean for other 
evidence in the nov 28 1987 crash including the flight data 
recorder which would include technical information on the last few 
minutes of the flight the cockpit tape which officials said was 
flooded but has been cleaned and dried records all talk and other 
noise in the cockpit 
eastport international of upper marlboro md which has been 
involved in deepwater recovery of wreckage of the space shuttle 
challenger as well as other air crashes retrieved the recorder last 
friday from a depth of 14800 feet with its 5 million remote 
recovery vehicle known as gemini 6000 
craig mullen president of the company said in a telephone 
interview that the plane looks like it went in intact and hit at a 
high rate of speed he said recovered parts show evidence the 
plane may have been on fire 
the south african government has refused to release contents of a 
control tower tape of conversation with the airliner pilot who 
officials earlier said reported smoke in his cockpit before the 
crash the government says contents of the conversation might be 
misunderstood or cause embarrassment 
the airliner was on a flight from taipei taiwan to 
johannesburg when it disappeared near the island of mauritius where 
it was to make a scheduled landing only 11 bodies were recovered 
and it took two months to locate the wreckage which mullen said is 
strewn over a square mile of deep ocean the victims included 
taiwanese south africans and japanese 
the recorder box about a foot square was found lying by itself 
and was picked up as the gemini was preparing to bring a larger 
piece of the aircraft to the surface mullen said

as many as 2000 nicaraguans now able to leave texas 
because of a judges order likely will come to miami this week 
taxing the capacity of local government officials said thursday 
earlier this week a federal judge in texas issued a temporary 
restraining order lifting an immigration policy that restricted 
immigrants to the area near the mexican border officials there say 
that probably 5000 exiles are affected and a miami shelter 
official cristobal mendoza said the city will probably have 2000 
new arrivals by the weekend 
managers of bus stations in south texas told reporters that 95 
percent or more of the nicaraguans who left there wednesday were 
going to miami permission was given to 739 exiles to leave 
brownsville on wednesday 
as the buses pulled into miami on wednesday and thursday hopeful 
nicaraguans climbed off eager to reunite with their families and 
find jobs 
but city officials who originally thought they would spend this 
week getting ready for the super bowl say the aliens may not find 
the haven they expect 
the inn is full city manager cesar odio said referring to 
miami bobby maduro stadium home now to more than 250 immigrants 
and those already there must be out by jan 25 when the baltimore 
orioles baseball team will arrive for spring training 
the judges order in texas was to relieve the conditions of 
aliens stuck there for weeks many living in squalid conditions 
now they can stay wherever they like while they wait for their 
cases to be reviewed and many have chosen miami 
dade county manager joaquin avino said some county land is being 
cleared for as many as 60 trailers which will provide temporary 
housing 
new immigration rules are responsible for much of the confusion 
surrounding this latest influx of immigrants perry rivkind 
district director of the immigration and naturalization service said 
thursday 
in the past those who arrived illegally in the united states 
were entitled to work permits if they could not be interviewed about 
their applications for asylum within 60 days but applicants now 
must get a favorable ruling from the ins before getting a permit 
what people dont understand that come here illegally today is 
that the us congress passed employer sanctions said rivkind 
without the work permit the employers are not going to chance 
getting into trouble 
many of the aliens said they headed to miami because they had 
heard the city was supportive of them 
throughout mexico they kept on telling us about bobby maduro 
stadium said sergio castillo he passed through mexico crossing 
the rio grande on sunday and arrived in miami by bus wednesday so 
i came here but i thought everybody could enter 
castillo and 14 others were locked out of the stadium wednesday 
night he said he spent much of that night walking the streets 
looking for a place to stay

presidentelect bush completed his cabinet on 
thursday picking retired naval chief james d watkins an expert on 
nuclear power as energy secretary and appointing former education 
secretary william bennett to help lead an allout war against 
drugs 
bush said watkins experience would serve him well in devising a 
strategy for a multibilliondollar cleanup of the nations aging and 
increasingly unsafe nuclear weapons plants 
bush said he would not try to tone down bennett who has a 
reputation for being blunt and blustery im not going to ask him 
to renounce that vim and that vigor and that determination that made 
him a howling success in reagans administration bush said 
bennett a twopackaday cigarette smoker who has tried to quit 
and failed vowed he would give up his habit before beginning his 
new job 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel 
praised bennett for his reputation for being tough and for 
confronting issues head on but said he was concerned about 
bennetts lack of law enforcement background 
biden said bennett in the past has been critical of our public 
school system i hope that his attitude will change to recognize as 
i do the crucial role the public schools can play in helping our 
youngest children recognize the dangers of drug abuse 
sen james a mcclure ridaho senior gop member of the senate 
energy and natural resources committee called watkins 
straightforward and capable 
us arms control adviser edwin l rowny praised the selection of 
watkins and called it a boost for the strategic defense initiative 
also known as star wars which seeks to develop a spacebased 
defense against soviet ballistic missiles 
rep charles b rangel dny chairman of the house narcotics 
committee said he is ready to work with bennett to fully fund the 
antidrug programs the congress has authorized and to develop a 
thorough well thoughtout strategy i hope is is forthcoming with 
creative ideas he must take bold initiatives and generate new 
resources to solve the drug crisis in our nation 
bush announced his personnel choices at a news conference shortly 
before convening the first informal meeting of his cabinet across 
the street from the white house at blair house the government guest 
home 
bush said he wanted cabinet chiefs to think big to 
challenge the system to adhere to the highest ethical 
standards and he said im going to tell them i dont like 
kissandtell books 
i dont mind differences being aired bush said i want 
them to be frank i want them to fight hard for their position 
yet he said he expected them to support his decisions once theyre 
made 
replying to a question bush said he was not entirely 
comfortable with the cost of his inauguration which could reach 25 
million however bush said i have no apologies for the way were 
doing it at all because the country deserves a celebration like 
the inauguration every four years 
bush who takes office jan 20 acknowledged that he faces huge 
costs both in the cleanup of nuclear weapons facilities and the 
crisis of the savings and loan industry 
however bush who during the campaign promised not to raise 
taxes said he would solve both problems within the confines the 
parameters of the commitment i made to the american people 
in introducing watkins bush said im committed to solving the 
problems that exist within our atomic energydefense complex 
he refused to embrace the recommendations of a report sent to 
president reagan calling for spending 81 billion to modernize the 
nuclear weapons complex over the next two decades and the closing of 
four major facilities bush said he wanted watkins to review all 
options before devising an energy policy that clearly will include 
the safety and cleanup of the nuclear plants 
bush said development of nuclear power for domestic as well as 
military needs was not at all incompatible with safety and 
environmental concerns 
bush said he told watkins he wanted him to consider choosing a 
deputy with experience in the oil and gas industry but said he 
would not impose that choice trying to reassure texas producers 
bush said they would have a president who knows the oil and gas 
industry well 
watkins asked how he would shore up oil prices replied 
youre touching me in an achilles heel im not an expert in this 
area he said however he was a fast learner 
acknowledging that bennett has been closely identified with the 
republican partys conservative wing bush said that his new drug 
czar would have to work with democrats and republicans alike 
bennett said that everybody has critics particularly people 
who try to do anything he promised to pursue his new job with 
great seriousness and humility 
bennett said this drug business is a serious business and this 
government this administration intends to take it seriously 
watkins said he was taking the energy post with a commitment to 
make sure safety is never subverted and the environment is 
adequately protected while nuclear energy is developed 
on other topics raised by reporters bush 
defended his decision to attend the funeral of japanese emperor 
hirohito though he said that if someone had raised the possibility 
of his current situation after his plane was shot down by the 
japanese in 1944 i would have found that hard to believe 
applauded a soviet announcement that that nation would reduce 
stocks of chemical weapons and said im glad the soviets have 
joined us in that weve been doing that for some time regarding 
international pressure on libya to not produce chemical weapons 
bush said my view is that i will follow on what this 
administration has been doing to try to find verifiable ways of 
eliminating these things 
said us oil reserves are not threatened by labor unrest in 
mexicos oil fields and saluted the mexican presidents very 
bold crackdown on the oil workers union 
watkins 61 chief of naval operations until 1986 under reagan 
is a nuclear warfare expert whose name had not been widely mentioned 
until recently as a possible candidate for the energy post 
he was chairman of a presidential commission on aids that last 
year called for new laws to protect victims of the deadly disease 
from discrimination 
bennett 45 the bluntspoken education chief under reagan and a 
leader of conservative forces left government last september to 
lecture and write 
bush had a hard time filling both the energy and drug posts 
after a quick start in naming his cabinet he now winds up with the 
modernday record for lateness in completing his senior 
appointments the mark had been held by reagan who completed his 
cabinet on jan 8 four days ahead of when bush finished 
bush had promised to include women and minorities in his cabinet 
he will begin his presidency with a cabinet of 13 men and one woman 
elizabeth dole at labor carla hills picked as the us trade 
representative has cabinet rank but is not an official member of 
the cabinet 
one black louis sullivan as chief of health and human services 
and two hispanics lauro cavazos as education secretary and manuel 
lujan jr as interior secretary are in the bush cabinet 
unlike the reagan cabinet the bush team is generally regarded as 
a republican establishment group that is nonideological and 
pragmatic 
after meeting with his cabinet bush heads off friday to the 
florida keys for a weekend of sport fishing in the everglades it 
will be his third fishing or hunting trip since his election two 
months ago

a letter signed jewish defence league that 
reached the london office of the associated press on thursday 
claimed responsibility for the bomb planted on pan am flight 103 
there was no evidence that the letter which used the british 
spelling defence came from the jewish defense league which is 
based in the united states 
we think the moment has come to disclose to the world from 
which side the bomb was placed which destroyed the boeing 737 from 
panam the typewritten letter said we a radical group of the 
jewish defence league take the responsibility for this action 
mordechai levy a spokesman who returned a call to the jdl 
offices in new york said anyone could type a letter it was not 
us why would we or any other jewish group bomb an american 
plane 
levy said his group now is called the jewish defense organization 
the plane blown up by a bomb dec 21 was a boeing 747 not a 737 
the letter said the bomb was planted by our fighters in 
frankfurt to protest the us decision a week earlier to open 
talks with the palestine liberation organization 
it bore a dutch stamp and a leeuwarden postmark another postmark 
had been added in london apparently because it was insufficiently 
addressed and required rerouting 
we are firmly decided to continue our attacks on usa objects 
until the american government returns from its detestable policy 
it said we mean the condemnable friendly connections with our 
enemy the plo 
scotland yard said it was investigating the claim 
comments by police in leeuwarden northern holland cast doubt on 
the letters authenticity 
a police officer speaking on condition of anonymity said there 
had been previous cases of dutch citizens making false claims of 
responsibility for violent incidents 
ian geldard an expert at the independent institute for the study 
of terrorism also was skeptical if the motive was the usplo 
connection he said it would have been impossible to prepare and 
plant a sophisticated bomb in the few days between the us 
announcement and the crash 
geldard also said he doubted the jdl had access to the plastic 
explosive semtex which officials say probably semtex was used for 
the bomb all 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground were 
killed 
the jewish defense league was founded in the united states in the 
1960s by rabbi meir kahane who now lives in israel and pursues a 
militant antiarab line 
an iranian group also claimed responsibility for the bombing in 
two telephone calls to the ap in london calling it retaliation for 
the shooting down of an iranian passenger jet in july by a us 
warship in the persian gulf

presidentelect bush said thursday he intends 
to support angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi and at the same time 
push for peace talks between the rebels and the marxist government 
bush confirmed he had sent a letter to savimbi last week on the 
occasion of the signing of a usmediated agreement for the pullout 
of cuban troops from angola 
i want to join you in welcoming this great diplomatic 
achievement which holds out so much hope for the angolan people 
bush said in the letter 
but he added that the next step must be talks between savimbis 
union for the total independence of angola unita and the 
government of jose eduardo dos santos on ending their 14year civil 
war 
bush said his administration will accord the highest priority 
to the full and prompt implementation of the pullout accord so 
that angolans can settle their future without the destructive 
presence of foreign military forces 
until then my administration will continue all appropriate and 
effective assistance to unita the letter said 
in brief comments at a news conference bush said that clearly 
in expressing determination to support unita and urge at the same 
time reconciliation between dos santos and savimbi im for that 
policy and i want to try and enhance it 
there is strong bipartisan support in congress for the 15 
million annual appropriation to unita to fight the cubanbacked 
government

most canadians believe bilingual commercial signs 
with messages in english and french should be allowed in the french 
enclave of quebec according to a gallup poll published thursday 
the poll published in the toronto star also found growing 
support for the canadianus free trade agreement 
according to the survey 85 percent of all canadians and 61 
percent of quebec residents favor bilingual signs 
tensions have increased in the predominantly frenchspeaking 
province since december when the supreme court of canada ruled that 
a provincial law requiring all signs to be only in french was 
unconstitutional 
the provincial government overrode the ruling and issued 
compromise legislation that allows bilingual signs indoors but still 
requires all outdoor signs to be in french only 
gallup said the poll surveyed 1021 canadians jan 47 and has a 
margin of error of 3 percent 
supporters of quebecs language restrictions argue that the 
province is an island of french culture in englishspeaking north 
america and entitled to protect its special qualities 
power in quebec shifted from the english minority to the french 
which make up 81 percent of the population during the 1970s a 
tumultuous decade of separatist sentiment that subsided when voters 
rejected a sovereignty referendum in 1980 
the law requiring all commercial signs to be in french was passed 
in 1977 
the globe and mail which calls itself canadas national 
newspaper said in an editorial thursday that quebec premier robert 
bourassa has received and deserves strong criticism for his 
decision on the language of commercial signs in quebec there is 
a danger however in raising the temperature on this issue 
the gallup poll also found increased support for the 
canadianus free trade agreement since the nov 21 election that 
cleared the way for the deal 
according to the poll 45 percent of canadians support the 
agreement under which all tariffs between the two nations will be 
eliminated within 10 years 
before the election which hinged mainly on free trade gallup 
found that 34 percent of canadians supported the pact the latest 
poll indicated that 29 percent oppose it down from 41 percent 
before the election 
prime minister brian mulroneys progressive conservative party 
won its second consecutive majority government in the election and 
he signed the trade pact with president reagan in january 1988

israeli deputy foreign minister benjamin 
netanyahu held what he called a very good conversation thursday 
with secretary of state george p shultz amid indications israel 
will soon unveil a new plan for settling its conflict with the arabs 
netanyahu declined to say after the 40minute session whether he 
outlined proposals for shultz but the israeli official said he 
would return to washington in the near future with some good 
suggestions 
they are likely to be based on the 1978 camp david agreement 
which produced a peace treaty in 1979 between israel and egypt and 
held out the prospect of selfrule for the 13 million palestinian 
arabs who live on the west bank and in gaza 
the us decision last month to open talks with the palestine 
liberation organization and continuing violence in the territories 
have put pressure on israel to deal with the palestinian problem

geraldo rivera may have trouble finding 
something in vaults but not new york citys tax collectors 
the states top court thursday upheld the citys authority to 
collect taxes from the owners of underground vaults that extend 
beneath public streets and sidewalks 
unlike al capones vault which rivera found empty in a 
nationally televised program theres money in new york city vaults 
the city is owed an estimated 203 million in back taxes dating to 
1962 according to the city finance department 
the court of appeals ruled against a manhattan property owner who 
complained that he shouldnt have to pay a 250000 tax bill on his 
vault because he didnt use it 
its the biggest crime in the world said lawyer philip 
smith owner of the 20 million building 
there are 14616 underground vaults in the city said claire 
tallarico spokeswoman for the finance department since 1962 the 
city has imposed a yearly tax of 2 per square foot on the vaults 
some of which are cavernous she said 
its the biggest bargain for storage space in town we think 
tallarico said 
many property owners however complained they didnt even know 
they had the vaults until they received a tax bill 
smith said the basement of his building is used to store 
furniture for an ethan allen franchise but the vault has been 
unoccupied since it was flooded in the 1960s 
the finance department said the vault is taxable unless it is 
rendered unusable by a wire mesh screen or sheetrock partition with 
an opening no larger than three feet by three feet 
all seven court of appeals judges said smith could be taxed 
because he didnt follow these rules 
smith said the entrance to his vault is barricaded by 
cinderblocks 
how can they say a chickenwire fence is more inaccessible than 
cinderblocks he said

many states in spite of their own tight 
budgets are adding benefits to their medicaid plans and expanding 
eligibility beyond federal requirements a report by a federally 
funded healthpolicy research group said thursday 
the favorites among optional coverages being added are 
maternityrelated benefits according to the report by the 
intergovernmental health policy project at george washington 
university 
they see there is a potential payoff touted by all those 
studies that show when you invest in prenatal care youre going to 
lower the costs later on by producing healthier babies said debra 
lipson senior research associate at the project 
thats been a pretty easy sales job on states she said 
since september 1987 legislatures in 19 states have added funds 
to their medicaid programs to cover new services for pregnant women 
the report said 
in addition by august 1988 some 45 states had expanded medicaid 
eligibility for pregnant women and infants although seven of the 
states wont implement the new standards until this year the report 
said 
these moves came in advance of changes in federal law that will 
require states to cover infants and pregnant women at or below 75 
percent of the federal poverty level by july 1 and up to 100 percent 
of the federal poverty level by july 1 1990 
other benefits being added by states include expanded coverage 
for hospice services communitybased longterm care prescription 
drugs and dental services the report said 
no state reported making any significant cuts in benefits 
during the period studied which was september 1987 through december 
1988 the report said 
states also are making changes in their administration and 
management of medicaid programs to control costs the report said 
last year 12 states changed the way they review elective admissions 
to hospitals other states are encouraging enrollment in health 
maintenance organizations 
the report offers no conclusions or recommendations but lipson 
said it disputes the notion that costsavings and innovation only 
come from the private sector 
the medicaid program is funded by the federal and state 
governments and is administered by the states the total cost of the 
program all federal and state funds was 52 billion in fiscal 
1987 
lipson said she had no figure for the number of recipients who 
would be added to the medicaid rolls as a result of the changes 
being made by the states however she noted that president reagans 
fiscal 1990 budget proposal to congress estimated that medicaid 
would serve 257 million people compared with 239 million 
currently 
the project is funded by the health care financing administration 
of the department of health and human services

president hosni mubarak on thursday urged 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel to agree to an international 
middle east peace conference 
in a related development a staterun newspaper in the united 
arab emirates said shamir has proposed a peace conference that would 
include the superpowers and palestinian representatives elected from 
the israelioccupied lands 
a shamir spokesman denied the report and said shamir still is 
working on a new peace proposal 
mubarak reiterated on thursday that he will not visit israel 
unless that country agrees to an international peace conference on 
the palestinian conflict 
all countries of the world except israel have accepted such a 
conference as the proper framework for arabisraeli peace talks 
mubarak said a conference under un auspices would bring 
together concerned parties and the five permanent members of the 
un security council 
egypt and the palestine liberation organization say the 
conference should lead to direct arabisraeli talks 
mubarak told reporters he plans to discuss peace and other 
regional problems when he visits washington after presidentelect 
george bush takes office on jan 20 
asked about prospects of his visiting israel mubarak replied 
i cannot visit israel particularly after mr shamir announced 
he will not make territorial concessions and does not accept an 
international peace conference he is not giving something in return 
or paying a price for my visit and we will not go there to have 
tea and coffee or to have a good time 
shamir has refused to relinquish any arab territory israeli 
forces now occupy the west bank the gaza strip and the golan 
heights all seized in the 1967 middle east war 
egypt and israel signed the camp david accord in 1978 and 
established diplomatic relations but mubarak has not visited israel 
since taking office in 1981 
in abu dhabi the staterun newspaper alittihad said a new plan 
by shamir was presented to us secretary of state george shultz and 
to his soviet counterpart eduard shevardnadze on sunday in paris 
alittihad attributed the report to an unidentified source in 
washington that it described as close to the us administration 
the paper said the plan proposed a middle east peace conference 
hosted by the superpowers and talks between israel and 
palestinians to be elected in the occupied territories 
at the end of a threeyear autonomy two years less than the 
autonomy under the camp david accords shamir proposed a 
confederation with jordan and the palestinians and allowing 
palestinians and jordan an access to the sea it said 
under the plan israel palestine and jordan would be linked 
economically in a way similar to that of the european economic 
community and a joint authority should be created to explore water 
and soil alittihad said 
the camp david accords were a tripartite framework for an overall 
arabisraeli settlement that was signed by the united states egypt 
and israel in 1978 it was rejected by other arab nations 
shamir spokesman yosi achimeir said the alittihad report was 
just speculation nothing formal has been released although the 
prime minister is considering many plans based on camp david 
foreign minister moshe arens not shamir was in paris on sunday 
to meet with shultz 
no peace plan was presented by mr arens in paris shamir is 
now working on a plan to be presented to president bush in march 
but nothing has been completed yet achimeir said 
achimeir said the plan would contain no peace conference but 
there could be a ceremonial opening by the superpowers or an 
initiative by the secretarygeneral of the united nations

the space agency scarred by the challenger 
accident in which the first teacher in space was killed 
announced thursday it will no longer carry nonastronauts or other 
nonessential personnel on the space shuttle 
passengers have in the past included a saudi arabian prince and 
members of the senate and house of representatives 
the new policy covers members of the news media who were in 
final competition for a ride on the shuttle at the time of 
challenger and barbara morgan a backup to christa mcauliffe the 
teacher who was among the seven people killed when the spacecraft 
exploded in january 1986 
the challenger accident marked a major change in the us 
outlook and policies with respect to the flight of other than nasa 
astronauts the national aeronautics and space administration said 
in a policy statement nasa and interested external parties 
domestic and internatijonal must reexamine previous understandings 
expectations and commitments regarding flight opportunities 
the agency said flight opportunities generally will be limited to 
professional astronauts and payload specialists essential for 
mission requirements while nasa works to improve the reliability of 
the shuttle and reduces a payload backlog 
the new policy establishes an additional category space 
flight participants 
it embraces those whose presence on board the space shuttle is 
not required for operation of payloads or for other essential 
mission mission activities but is determined by the administrator 
of nasa to contribute to other approved nasa objectives or to be in 
the national interest 
sen jake garn rutah flew on the shuttle in april 1985 and 
rep bill nelson dfla was aboard in january 1986 at the 
invitation of nasas administrator 
both hold positions important to the space program on 
congressional committees and the official explanation was that the 
flights were important to their oversight responsibilities 
in 1985 shuttle passengers included sultan alsaud of saudi 
arabia and rodolfo neri vela a mexican they were aboard nasa 
said to observe the launches of the arabsat and morelosb 
communications satellites being launched for their countries 
nasa said that while it remains committed to a longterm goal of 
providing such flight opportunities it is devoting its energies to 
proving the shuttle to be safe and reliable 
accordingly flight opportunities for space flight participants 
are not available at this time nasa said when nasa determines 
that a flight opportunity is available for a space flight 
participant first priority will be given to a teacher in space in 
fulfillment of space education plans 
all shuttle flights will be planned with a minimum crew of five 
nasa astronauts and can be increased to a maximum of seven for 
payload or other mission requirements such added crew members have 
to be picked at least 12 months before the flight and first 
consideration will be given to nasas own people

the government gave special status thursday to 
nagornokarabakh a disputed region with a predominantly armenian 
population but kept it within the republic of azerbaijan tass 
reported 
the decision by the presidium of the supreme soviet represented 
another attempt by moscow to ease tension over the area focus of a 
struggle between ethnic armenians and azerbaijanis that has led to 
60 deaths in the past year 
about 200000 refugees have left nagornokarabakh for armenia 
which wants to annex it the region is an enclave in azerbaijan to 
which it was assigned in 1923 
martial law and curfews were imposed in many parts of the two 
caucasus republics two months ago to quell ethnic violence 
tass said thursdays decision was made at a meeting of the 
presidium of the supreme soviet the governments highest executive 
body convened by president mikhail s gorbachev to consider 
urgent issues 
unconfirmed reports had circulated for more than a month that the 
kremlin would transfer nagornokarabakh to the russian federation 
largest of the 15 soviet republics in an effort to end the dispute 
a tass statement thursday however made clear it would remain 
within azerbaijan 
the official news agency said the presidium found it expedient 
to temporarily introduce in the nagornokarabakh autonomous region a 
special form of administration with nagornokarabakh retaining its 
status as an autonomous region incorporated in azerbaijan 
it did not describe the special administration but said a decree 
would be published later 
gorbachev said last week a special commission of the communist 
party politburo would meet wednesday to consider the ethnic dispute 
but there was no word that such a meeting had occurred 
tass said the party chiefs of the two republics met in moscow on 
wednesday and agreed to try to persuade people who fled ethnic 
violence to return home 
armenian residents of nagornokarabakh began agitating in 
february for annexation by armenia and huge demonstrations for the 
cause were held in yerevan the armenian capital and other cities 
of the southern republic 
in july the presidium rejected the annexation requests but 
announced a program of economic and other aid for nagornokarabakh

pan american world airways on thursday disputed a 
us media report that the airlines security was lax at frankfurt 
airport even after the bombing of flight 103 
all i can say is that we have a security staff that uses the 
most modern methods said airline spokesman harald kosel from his 
office in west berlin 
passengers are also matched up with their luggage and are 
given a list of questions to answer including where they came from 
whether they packed their luggage themselves and so forth and 
their passports are checked against their tickets kosel said 
asked if luggage brought on board by crew members also was 
checked kosel said yes of course everyone is checked 
kosel said the security staff was part of a pan am subsidiary 
called alert 
abc world news tonight on wednesday alleged that baggage handlers 
and others at londons heathrow airport were not given a thorough 
background check and that at least one pan am security guard in 
frankfurt said he had received only minimal training before going to 
work for the company 
the abc report came three weeks and a day after a bomb destroyed 
pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 all 259 
people aboard the plane and at least 11 on the ground were killed 
investigators are trying to learn who placed the explosives 
aboard the airplane and where the new yorkbound flight began at 
frankfurt and changed planes in london 
kosel said it appears now 999 percent sure that this didnt 
happen in frankfurt 
british investigators have said the explosives ruptured the 
fuselage of the boeing 747 in the area of the cargo hold just 
forward of the planes left wing 
they have also said they suspect the bomb used was an explosive 
produced in czechoslovakia called semtex czech officials have 
agreed to send experts to britain to assist in the investigation

israel and the soviet union traded shots on the 
basketball court thursday night in a game followed so intently in 
israel that radio appeals were made to taxi and bus drivers not to 
mix driving and listening 
the dribble diplomacy was the latest sign of improving relations 
between americas closest middle east ally and the soviet union the 
main political and military backer of israels arab enemies 
the fact that our team is there and playing is quite an 
encouraging step said foreign ministry deputy spokesman daniel 
scheck 
the viewing audience was huge for the first live broadcast from 
moscow in which underdog tel aviv maccabi beat the red armys cska 
team 9792 in a nation of only 42 million more than 2 million 
people were watching at the last basket according to tv managing 
director chaim yavin 
even prime minister yitzhak shamir not a noted sports 
enthusiast took time out to watch the game on a small portable set 
in his office 
after the victory fans took to the streets shouting we won we 
wonand bus and taxi drivers beeped their horns 
its a great victory for maccabi tel aviv in the heart of 
moscow in the eyes of the world education minister yitzhak navon 
told the national itim news agency 
over 1000 maccabi fans applied to go to the soviet union but 
only about a dozen were granted visas 
the late afternoon starting time cut rushhour traffic to a 
trickle in major cities as workers raced home early to see the game 
jerusalems central mahane yehuda market closed three hours ahead of 
schedule 
some israelis gathered in pizzerias and cafes to watch cheering 
wildly at each basket nut stands and candy stores reported a 
booming business as sports fans bought up nibbles for the big game 
shaul yefan director of the electric company appealed to 
viewers not to use water heaters and ovens during the game he said 
power blackouts might occur because so many tv sets were on at the 
same time 
in basketballcrazy israel the sports interest for israels 
first moscow game since 1973 was a major factor but there was also 
an unmistakable sense of drama over the changing political climate 
israel tv opened its broadcast with a shot of the oniondomed 
kremlin and a voiceover commentary by correspondent yoram arbel who 
said history is being made 
israel and the soviet union have been without diplomatic 
relations since the 1967 middle east war when the kremlin broke 
ties in protest of israel seizure of arab territory 
the climate has warmed markedly since the soviets sent a 
diplomatic delegation to take up residence in july 1987 
part of the reason for the improved soviet image is attributed to 
steadily building contacts at the nonofficial level including the 
visit of soviet musicians a leading poet and ordinary soviet 
tourists cultural visits are particularly popular not leastly 
because israel has 250000 immigrants from the soviet union 
foreign minister moshe arens said the rapprochement is motivated 
by the soviet desire to play a role in any middle east peace 
settlement and the necessity to convince israel such a role can be 
constructive 
israel had conditioned soviet participation on enlarged jewish 
emigration and freedom of jewish cultural life in the soviet union 
as well as restoration of full diplomatic ties 
whatever hesitations we may have had in the past they were 
concerned with the fact that many jews who pursued zionist activity 
have been imprisoned and emigration was restricted arens said 
tuesday upon return from paris where he met with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
most of that has disappeared arens acknowledged 
the two nations appeared to be moving steadily if slowly 
toward renewal of diplomatic relations 
shevardnadze announced sunday the soviet decision to upgrade the 
status of an israeli delegation in moscow and include political 
matters in its range of activities 
israeli foreign ministry officials say this means israels envoys 
and their soviet counterparts in tel aviv will turn into de facto 
permanent diplomatic missions

the united nations ended 1988 more than 
750 million in the red mainly because the united states withheld 
its dues during the reagan administration according to figures 
obtained thursday 
the united states the largest un contributor owed 4017 
million according to an advance copy of the 1988 annual financial 
figures obtained by the associated press that figure equals 535 
percent of the total arrears of the regular and peacekeeping 
budgets according to the advance copy 
the regular budget ended the year 3949 million in the red more 
than 40 million over the arrears at the end of 1987 peacekeeping 
budgets ended 1988 3552 million in arrears 
the united states had said it was withholding funds to protest 
antius bias in the world body and inefficient administration 
president reagan said in september he was satisfied with the 
progress of reforms at the united nations and ordered the state 
department to devise a schedule for repaying all us arrears 
officials at the new yorkbased world body said the funding 
crunch had jeopardized the un payroll and could undermine un 
efforts to field international peacekeeping troops which won the 
1988 nobel peace prize 
weve spotted land but are not yet ashore said un 
comptroller luis m gomez clearly to successfully take on the 
many tasks now being given us by the world community member states 
are going to have to start paying in full and on time and these 
arrears must be reduced 
washington was responsible for 3076 million or about 77 
percent of the arrears in the regular budget the soviet union owed 
9 million or 2 percent of the regular arrears 
moscow was responsible for 1721 million nearly half the 
arrears in peacekeeping the united states was responsible for 941 
million or 26 percent 
eightysix of the 159 member nations paid all their dues through 
the end of 1988 a better showing than in the past at the end of 
1987 only 75 nations were paid up 
brazil a nation with its own serious financial troubles 
pleasantly surprised the world body in december by paying all its 
dues 179 million said martti ahtasaari the un 
undersecretarygeneral in charge of administration 
the total regular un budget is about 880 million of which the 
united states is assessed onefourth and the soviet union 118 
percent 
in addition to the united states and the soviet union 10 other 
nations owe more than 1 million to the regular budget south 
africa 339 million iran 79 million argentina 52 million 
poland 43 million romania 4 million yugoslavia 35 million

independent counsel lawrence walsh said 
thursday he believes former presidential aide oliver l north can be 
tried on coverup charges without raising the national security 
concerns which undermined conspiracy and theft counts 
the governments case no longer depends on proving that the 
proceeds of the iranian arms sales constituted government property 
or that by diverting those proceeds to the contras north embezzled 
them walsh said in a court filing 
walsh outlined the prosecutions legal theory of the case against 
north in the event the conspiracy and theft charges against the 
fired national security council aide are dropped as expected 
norths possible defenses to the charges which focus largely on 
the coverup of various aspects of the irancontra affair are 
narrowly circumscribed walsh said in the court filing 
the classified information problems affecting the conspiracy 
and theft counts should no longer be at issue walsh said 
walshs view differs sharply with that of norths attorney 
brendan sullivan last thursday sullivan said that classified 
information pervades the remaining charges as well 
the independent counsel said the government will prove that north 
aided the contras and then misrepresented his activities to 
congress in 1985 obstructed a congressional inquiry into his 
activities a year later and then lied to the attorney general about 
details of the diversion of money to the contras 
walsh also said the government need not establish norths motives 
for committing acts such as destroying and altering documents and 
misrepresenting his activities to congress 
walsh said north may attempt to bring classified information into 
the case by saying that he had covered up because superiors directed 
him to or because everything he did was authorized and perfectly 
legal in neither approach should north be permitted to bring up 
classified information said walsh 
on monday however us district judge gerhard gesell said that 
while motive does not determine guilt or innocence under the law 
north does have the right to show that the activities he sought to 
cover up were not illegal north might then seek to bring in some of 
the same classified information that led to walsh abandoning the 
conspiracy and theft charges 
no doubt norths motives were mixed said walsh to cover 
up activities in support of the contras which the congress might 
protest to cover up prior lies to avoid political embarrassment to 
the administration or to avoid charges of illegality 
however walsh added the jury will not be asked to decide this 
case on the basis of norths motives or the legality of the conduct 
he was covering up 
the independent counsel last week gave up his pursuit of the 
conspiracy and theft of government property charges against north 
because the reagan administration refused to declassify portions of 
documents us district judge gerhard gesell said were needed to 
conduct a fair trial 
attorney general dick thornburgh and walsh filed declarations and 
a memorandum under seal with gesell that outlined the national 
security problem gesell may dismiss the two counts on friday 
nine of the 12 counts that would remain focus on norths 
allegedly concealing from congress and former attorney general edwin 
meese iii his efforts on behalf of the contras 
in addition north is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 
security system at his home from codefendant richard secord 
converting to his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from 
contra leader adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury 
of tax revenue in connection with charitable contributions 
supporting the contras

because the game was not between two national teams 
fans of the israeli team chanted maccabi maccabi and waved 
a dozen blueandwhite banners emblazoned with the star of david 
at one point several broke into an old israeli folk song 
weve brought peace to you

midpoint and then made it 7151 with about 12 minutes left

forward sergei tarakanov

9389 with a jump shot from the free throw circle and then scored 
two free throws to make it 9591 with about a minute left

however 
soviet jews said they had no trouble buying tickets 
detrokalashuvili who said he plans to join his parents sister and 
brother in israeli in april bought 20 tickets and distributed them 
to friends who came up from georgia for the game

american jew from new york city is an israeli citizen who has been 
on the team for 12 years he came to israel as a college student to 
play in the maccabiah games an olympictype event for jews across

nato and warsaw pact nations on thursday 
broke off discussions on arms control talks because of a lingering 
dispute between greece and turkey western diplomats said 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said east 
and west negotiators agreed to meet again on friday 
the 16 nato nations meanwhile will continue to search for a way 
to break the impasse between greece and turkey over the eastern 
mediterranean port of mersin the diplomats said 
greece wants the port included in the new talks on cutting 
conventional forces across europe because it alleges the port is a 
base for shipping arms to northern cyprus which is controlled by 
turkey 
turkey insists the port be excluded since it is close to syria 
which is not included in the new arms talks or in the 35nation 
helsinki process on security and human rights 
the soviet union agreed to exclude the port and the nearby us 
air base of incirlik from the eastwest arms talks turkey fears 
reopening the issue of mersin also could change moscows mind over 
the air base which it long sought to include in the new talks 
the dispute threatens to block new eastwest agreements on arms 
control talks and a landmark human rights accord 
the arms talks are designed to reduce warsaw pact and nato 
troops tanks and airborne forces from the atlantic to the ural 
mountains deep inside the soviet union 
they could begin as early as march according to diplomats from 
nato and warsaw pact nations 
but if the greekturkish dispute is not solved by the end of this 
week the new eastwest arms talks cannot be set before the reagan 
administration leaves office diplomats say 
the overall agreement at the 35nation helsinki review conference 
on security and human rights in europe also would be at risk 
the mandate for the new arms control talks is supposed to be part 
of the final document agreed on by the 35 nations at the conference 
which began work in november 1986 
a draft of the final document was presented last week a day 
before the united states and britain removed a major obstacle by 
announcing they are willing to attend a 1991 human rights meeting in 
moscow

west german finance minister gerhard 
stoltenberg on thursday urged the incoming bush administration to 
make reducing the us budget deficit a top priority saying more 
reductions are needed to take pressure off international financial 
markets 
stoltenberg said the united states is still importing large sums 
of foreign capital to finance its large twin trade and federal 
budget deficits 
this flow of foreign capital estimated at around 10 billion a 
month means less money going into productive investments in 
countries outside the united states stoltenberg said in a speech 
further reductions in the us federal deficit would take a lot 
of pressure off the international capital markets and help stabilize 
interest rates around the world stoltenberg said 
stoltenberg was asked during a question period following the 
speech how fast congress and the bush administration need to act on 
the deficit problem in order to reassure jittery world financial 
markets 
he said he realized it takes some time to work out 
governmental problems in the united states but i hope it will be 
a solution this year and not only in the last months as it was in 
1987 
in 1987 congress and the reagan administration forged an 
agreement in december to lower the federal deficit following 
negotiations which had been prompted by the collapse of the stock 
market in october 
stoltenberg met earlier in the day with treasury secretary 
nicholas brady he met with federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
on wednesday and is scheduled to meet friday with richard darman 
nominated by bush as his budget director 
treasury department spokesman art siddon said brady and 
stoltenberg exchanged views on a wide range of issues that will 
confront the new administration 
officials said no decisions were reached on a proposed meeting 
between the united states and its top economic allies west germany 
japan britain france canada and italy 
brady is expected to attend such a meeting to assure us allies 
the new administration plans to pursue reagan administration 
policies which have sought to stabilize the value of the us dollar 
relative to other currencies 
in his speech stoltenberg said presidentelect george bush has 
made plain that he will continue to try to reduce the federal 
government deficit he said americans see that as the key to making 
more of their savings available for investment to keeping prices 
stable and interest rates low and to reducing the need to get money 
from abroad 
the very low savings ratio in the us and the effect of the 
budget and trade deficit necessitate a very high level of capital 
imports which in the long run would cause serious problems he 
said

an angolan who monitors a truce 
line on the namibian border said thursday there is an unpatrolled 
gap in the area to be checked for violations of a ceasefire between 
angolan and south african forces 
five months after the shooting stopped three of a scheduled 11 
posts have not yet been established along a 600mile stretch from 
ruacana east to zambia said maj valeriano martinho second in 
command of the angolan contingent on the joint commission 
martinho said 11 posts were to have been set up by the end of 
september after the truce was declared aug 8 he spoke to 
reporters at his camp near the ruacana control point 570 miles south 
of luanda capital of angola 
he said the unpatrolled sector runs from the town of cuangar 
about 315 miles east to the zambian frontier and includes the 
caprivi strip 
the presence of unita forces along the angolan border is 
obstructing the establishment of the three final posts he said 
we believe they south africans are continuing to support unita 
from that area 
asked whether angola had proof he replied no we have 
suspicions 
guerrillas of unita the national union for the total 
independence of angola which the united states supports have 
fought angolas marxist government since independence from portugal 
in 1975 south african troops have operated in southern angola 
helping unita and pursuing namibian guerrillas of the southwest 
africa peoples organization 
south africa said dec 22 it had halted aid to unita neither 
unita nor swapo is involved in the truce or in the usmediated 
peace plan for southern africa signed by south africa angola and 
cuba 
angola has protested the failure to establish the three remaining 
posts martinho said at sessions of the joint monitoring commission 
that includes six members each from angola cuba and six south 
africa 
the commission has met each weekday on the border about a mile 
from the angolan camp south africas camp is just across the 
frontier in southwest africa or namibia 
south africa captured the territory from germany in world war i 
and has governed it since for the past 22 years in defiance of the 
united nations 
under the threeway agreement signed dec 22 cubas 50000 
soldiers are to leave angola by mid1991 and namibia is to become 
independent after unsupervised election 
under the ceasefire agreement no significant movement of troops 
is permitted on either side of the border 
both martinho and 1st lt nelson coelho wore the orange armbands 
of the joint commission and carried sidearms they talked with 
reporters in the shade of thorn trees in the camp next to the 
ruacana dam on the cunene river which forms part of the border 
martinho said daily patrols by 22 angolans and 22 south african 
soldiers have not found significant violations of the ceasefire 
he said the cubans who are expected to have withdrawn 3000 
troops from angola by sunday do not take part in truce patrols 
few people live in the area a helicopter flight from the 
cubanbuilt airstrip at cahama south to ruacana falls revealed 
isolated huts patches of corn and small herds of goats and cattle

the countrys first woman cabinet member 
resigned thursday after a prosecutors report said she was 
strongly suspected of leaking confidential information to her 
husband about a drug inquiry 
the announcement by justice minister elisabeth kopp brings to a 
head this nations biggest scandal in years known as the lebanon 
connection 
in her statement distributed by a staff member mrs kopp said 
she was stepping down in the in the interest of a quick 
unconditional and comprehensive investigation 
mrs kopp acknowledged for the first time that seen today the 
telephone call to my husband was a mistake i regret she said 
keeping her post had become humanly and politically impossible 
last month she announced she would resign at the end of february 
defense minister arnold koller who also serves as mrs kopps 
deputy assumed the justice ministers post as caretaker until 
parliament approves her successor it is expected to do so within 
several weeks 
mrs kopp said wednesday she did not believe she was guilty of 
wrongdoing 
a prosecutors preliminary inquiry into the leak whose results 
were published wednesday said mrs kopp was strongly suspected of 
violating an official secret in warning her husband to sever ties 
with a company under investigation in a major drug moneylaundering 
scandal 
the inquiry by special prosecutor hans hungerbuehler said mrs 
kopp and two aides passed on details of a ministry file on the 
investigation of lebanesecontrolled shakarchi trading ag where 
her husband hans w kopp quit as board member after the warning 
newspaper reports say he left the same day his wife called she 
says she only passed on rumors she had discovered independently 
a week after the call prosecutors announced they were 
investigating the 1 billion moneylaundering operation shakarchi 
was among the companies and banks named by authorities as possibly 
involved but no charges have been filed 
in thursdays statement mrs kopp said she had asked the 
president of the parliament to take steps needed to lift her 
immunity from prosecution she said she did so in the interest of a 
complete inquiry 
i expect that this grave accusation will be resolved through a 
continuation of a public inquiry she said 
mrs kopps resignation follows nationwide debate of the affair 
which has generated domestic banner headlines for almost three 
months 
under swiss law a government official found guilty of violating 
an official secret can be fined or jailed for up to three years 
mrs kopp 52 rated the most popular cabinet member in a public 
opinion poll in december she also served as deputy interior 
minister and swiss vice president an honorific post rotating 
annually among the seven ministers

the fbi is investigating whether district of 
columbia del walter fauntroy broke federal laws by employing the 
son of a congressional colleague at a time that records show the son 
had sworn he was living in illinois a justice department offical 
said thursday 
fauntroy thomas john savage and rep gus savage dill are 
subjects of a preliminary investigation into fauntroys employment 
of the younger savage who said he was living in chicago and 
running for the illinois legislature at the same time he was on 
fauntroys payroll the official said 
department policy prohibited him from commenting further said 
the official who spoke only on condition he not be named 
in a related development rep julian dixon dcalif who chairs 
the house ethics committee also has written fauntroy who is the 
districts nonvoting member of congress asking for an explanation 
of savages employment according to a congressional source 
thomas savage earned 21398 while on fauntroys payroll from 
september 1987 through june 1988 
the justice department official said the fbi also is looking into 
any connection between fauntroys employment of the younger savage 
and rep savages employment of lezli baskerville a former fauntroy 
aide a month before fauntroy hired savage ms baskerville was 
ousted from a job savage gave her on the house public works and 
transportation committee 
after leaving the public works panel ms baskerville returned to 
fauntroys payroll where she was directed to do legislative work on 
behalf of the national black leadership roundtable a private group 
of black businessmen that fauntroy chairs according to a memo 
provided by fauntroy to his staff 
fauntroy in a statement released thursday said on the advice 
of counsel for the united states house of representatives while i 
have nothing to hide i have nothing to say 
it should be noted that no one on my staff has been subpoenaed 
by any law enforcement authorities nor has anyone on my staff even 
talked to any law enforcement authorities he added 
however the fbi officials investigating the matter do not have 
subpoena powers according to sources familiar with the probe 
in addition congressional sources and others familiar with the 
investigation said johnny barnes fauntroys staff director refused 
to meet with fbi agents who attempted to question him barnes 
refused to comment on the matter when telephoned by a reporter 
the federal investigation began last month after the associated 
press reported savage was on fauntroys payroll although he had 
submitted a sworn affidavit to illinois elections officials stating 
he had met state requirements by living continuously for two years 
in the state legislative district he sought to represent that 
period covered the time he was on fauntroys payroll 
fauntroy and the younger savage first said that he had worked on 
a district of columbia statehood bill but savage later conceded he 
rarely worked in fauntroys office and did little more than stuff 
envelopes while he was there 
when contacted by telephone in chicago thursday thomas savage 
said he was unaware of the investigation he refused further comment 
rep savage could not be reached for comment 
dixons letter asked fauntroy to explain how he had come to hire 
savage what duties savage performed and whether savage had 
regularly reported to work the congressional source reported 
house rules require that a congressional employee must report 
regularly to work 
dixon could not be reached for comment on his letter 
the fbi conducts a preliminary investigation after an initial 
determination that the known facts in a case warrant a more detailed 
examination ordinarily a report resulting from a preliminary 
investigation is sent to the us attorneys office for review a 
decision then is made whether to present the case to a grand jury 
in the fauntroy case the preliminary investigation will 
determine whether attorney general dick thornburgh will seek the 
appointment of a special prosecutor the procedure required when 
members of congress are involved

west german finance minister gerhard 
stoltenberg said thursday that bad feeling between the united 
states and west germany over alleged libyan construction of a 
chemical weapons plant has been cleared up 
stoltenberg noted his government had initially rejected us 
allegations that a german company had played a major role in the 
construction of the alleged libyan chemical weapons plant south of 
tripoli 
in recent days there has been some additional information after 
the first west german investigation proved nothing stoltenberg 
said in a questionandanswer session with reporters and officials 
you can read in the papers that there is now some suspicion 
that it is possible that some international trade company with a 
subsidiary in germany and possibly also a german company with a 
subsidiary were involved he said 
stoltenberg said some exports may have left west germany 
supposedly destined for another country but had wound up in libya 
this is possible but we cannot give a final judgment because 
we have and this will be done very urgently in these days to 
clear whether exports if they happened this way were against the 
law he said 
stoltenberg said it would have to be determined if the exports 
included sensitive components which would be used for weapon 
production or were pure civilian products not subject to embargo 
he said it remained important for the united states to share 
your deep concerns fully about the possible buildup of chemical 
weapons especially in countries which pursue a very dangerous 
international policy 
we are generally against it and we are very sensitive as you 
when we look to third countries stoltenberg said 
he noted that secretary of state george shultz and west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher had arranged for a team of 
german experts to come to washington this week to review the 
evidence which us officials say proves the american case 
im glad that by the political discussions some bad feeling 
which came up for a few days could be cleared up and that we could 
have this discussion now in a good atmosphere of mutual cooperation 
and mutual responsibility stoltenber said 
he said he hoped the cooperation would produce reasonable 
results in our interests and the interests of the world community

a new jersey mayors wife who died in a dec 1 
rail crash in perus andes mountains was most likely the victim of 
sabotage by a leftist guerrillas the us embassy said thursday 
anna cucci was killed and her husband jersey city mayor anthony 
cucci was injured dec 1 when the rail car they rode crashed near 
cuzco 355 miles southeast of lima 
she is the fourth american known to have been killed as a result 
of the maoist shining paths nearly 9yearold insurgency 
peruvian authorities at the time said saboteurs wedged a 10inch 
steel rod into the tracks which caused the single car to derail and 
tumble down a 250foot sloped ravine 
they said either guerrillas or workers supporting a communistled 
general strike caused the accident which also killed doris chacon 
the wife of cuzco mayor carlos chacon and severely injured the 
mayor 
the embassy said thursday that peruvian investigators since have 
reached the opinion that the guerrillas were behind the attack 
local officials believe chacon was the rebels most likely 
target the embassy said 
the crash occurred on cuzcos outskirts as the two couples along 
with jersey city councilman jaime vazquez and five other people 
were en route on a daylong outing to the ancient inca citadel of 
machu picchu 60 miles northwest of cuzco 
cucci who was in cuzco to participate in a sister city ceremony 
returned home with his wifes body a few days after the accident he 
signed the cuzcojersey city accord and vowed to help peru any way 
he could 
more than 12000 people have died in the shining paths fight to 
topple perus elected government and install marxist rule 
analysts said foreigners generally have not been targeted for 
attacks by the rebels but the foreign death toll has risen recently 
eight foreign tourists including two americans were killed in 
1986 when rebels bombed a train carrying passengers to machu picchu 
and one american and two french agricultural advisors were killed 
last year by highland guerrillas

tracy chapman seems of another time a time when 
dylan odetta seeger and guthrie celebrated freedom and the spirit 
of man and defied brutality and repression with their songs and 
anthems 
chapman whose selftitled debut album has been nominated for six 
grammys is of this age and her songs take a hard cold look at 
poverty racism inequality and human relations she is 
uncompromising tough and compassionate 
i think people look at the world in many different ways and 
choose to see what they like she said in an interview last year 
with the washington post i think lots of people ignore some of 
the harder issues the more unpleasant things i dont think i harp 
on them

bobby mcferrin whose feelgood anthem dont 
worry be happy brought him three of his five grammy award 
nominations thursday is a oneman band without the hardware 
the a cappella tune offering the advice of putting aside nagging 
worries of daily life such as paying the rent is a multitrack 
recording of simple lyrics accompanied by layers of sounds all made 
by mcferrin 
the vocal gymnasts nominations included best song record and 
male pop vocal performance for dont worry best album for 
simple pleasures and best male jazz vocal performance for the

the billboard charts and it brought the widest recognition to a 
voice heard on jeans commercials in the bill cosby show theme 
and singing the alphabet on sesame street 
mcferrin 38 left the orchestra out when he recorded simple 
pleasures using only his voice and other sounds such as 
percussion made with his body 
his live shows are much the same no band but a resourceful 
entertainer who can turn the audience into part of the show 
what youre hearing is me thinking aloud mcferrin said in a 
biography released by his label emimanhattan his intent is to get 
a mature audience to be childlike and spontaneous 
nominated six times previously mcferrin has already taken home 
five grammys three for best male jazz vocalist but he finds the

been infused with a lot of music

began studying music at the age of 6 the family moved to los

chancellor helmut kohl on thursday said 
authorities seized new documents that may show west german companies 
helped libya build what washington says is a chemical weapons plant 
kohl gave no details about the documents while answering 
questions from reporters in a studio appearance late thursday night 
on west germanys zdf television network 
the government previously maintained it had no evidence of a west 
german link to the plant at rabta south of tripoli the libyan 
capital the stunning reversal embarrassed west german authorities 
nbc news reported thursday that libyan officials contacted west 
german companies for cleanup help after a dangerous chemical spill 
in august at the facility 
west germanys imhausenchemie was one of those the libyans 
called for help the network reported 
a group of west germans was in the united states this week to 
examine evidence that washington says indicates the libyan plant is 
a chemical weapons factory libya says the facility is a 
pharmaceutical plant 
there are new indications that will be further checked kohl 
said when asked if the government had new evidence of west german 
involvement in building the plant 
more documents have been seized and they could give evidence i 
dont know 
kohl said the documents involved chemical equipment that could be 
used in many ways but he did not elaborate he did not say where 
the papers were seized 
he said the federal intelligence service also was involved in 
investigations kohl said authorities were looking for evidence that 
could stand in court before bringing any charges 
a ranking official said on condition of anonymity there is no 
question that these allegations have caused serious damage to west 
germanys international prestige the government is in an extremely 
embarrassing and difficult position 
in washington west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg 
noted his government initially rejected us allegations that a 
german company played a major role in the construction of the plant 
he said there was no more ill will between the washington and 
bonn 
im glad that by the political discussions some bad feeling 
which came up for a few days could be cleared up and that we could 
have this discussion now in a good atmosphere of mutual cooperation 
and mutual responsibility stoltenber said 
president reagan has raised the possiblity of military action 
against the plant 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher who told reporters a 
week earlier there was no proof of west german complicity said 
thursday there are a number of indications that evidently point 
in this direction 
ali treiki libyas un ambassador said on cbs news thursday 
that west germans did help us not only in this plant in other 
plants also 
in belgium the justice ministry said jozef gedopt head of cross 
link nv of antwerp was arrested and charged with forging shipping 
documents for goods delivered to libya 
a spokesman for the west german finance ministry said gedopt was 
arrested on the basis of information provided by west germany he 
said the information was found by investigators examining seized 
records of ibi engineering a defunct frankfurt company linked to 
the libya plant 
secretary of state george p shultz told kohl in november the 
united states had evidence of west german involvement in building 
and outfitting the plant 
us officials revealed the name of one suspect company 
imhausenchemie of lahr nearly two weeks ago prompting the finance 
ministry to order an investigation 
last week the government said an audit of the firms records 
produced no evidence of illegal exports 
on wednesday government sources confirmed that a criminal 
investigation of ibi engineerings activities was under way and 
said authorities had seized company documents 
a secretary who answered the telephone at imhausenchemie on 
thursday said company officials were not available for comment 
company manager juergen hippenstielimhausen has denied any 
connection to the libyan plant 
horst koerbler former business manager of ibi declined 
comment on the case the ard television network quoted koerbler 
earlier as saying many german firms were involved in the libyan 
project 
koerbler told the associated press he had been misquoted but 
would not elaborate

a film critic who gets 8 a review and 
wont do rrated movies has been banned from the only theater around 
because her negative reviews hurt business theater officials said 
cathy monnett a freelancer who writes for the twiceweekly palo 
verde valley times was given a refund and asked to leave as she 
watched a recent screening of gorillas in the mist at the 
600seat blythe cinema 
people were staying away from the theater because of her 
reviews said don davis the theater owners brother and an 
attorney for the blythe cinema in thursdays los angeles times 
paul davis 37 coowner of the theater called it a matter of 
economic survival even though his movies arent advertised in the 
paper 
but ms monnett who said most of her reviews are positive vowed 
to continue writing reviews even if she has to travel 90 miles to 
yuma ariz to see the pictures 
im incensed ms monnett said by driving to yuma im 
telling them they cant stop me from writing reviews 
ms monnett 29 gets 8 for each review she submits she said 
the standoff has spawned angry editorials in the paper with a 
circulation of 4500 protests outside the theater and talk of a 
legal challenge 
ms monnett who wrote similar reviews for some small newspapers 
in utah claims the ban was unfounded based on her track record in 
blythe a desert town of 8400 people about 220 miles east of los 
angeles 
of the 28 reviews i have written 17 have been positive she 
said 
thats a pretty good percentage said david anson a movie 
critic for newsweek magazine i dont think any of us would 
survive in blythe 
some of ms monets reviews have been harsh the movie hot to 
trot she wrote has only one thing to recommend it it will 
restore your faith in tv nothing on the tube is this stupid 
unimaginative tedious and irritating 
yet on the fantasyadventure willow she wrote it offers 
sympathetic characters a powerful conflict between good and evil 
fantastic action sequences and that most elusive of movie 
attributes a happy ending 
of police academy v she wrote the comedy is sophomoric 
but rarely offensive and youll even get a few big laughs for your 
money 
moonstruck which won cher an oscar for best actress oscar 
was basically a very oldfashioned movie with oldfashioned ideas 
about love but if it doesnt make a believer out of you maybe you 
should have your cynicism level checked 
paul davis considers ms monnett a dilettante lacking the 
credentials to review films 
in a letter to the editor published by the newspaper he wrote 
were her distorted negative and unfair criticism harmless we 
could perhaps ignore her and chuck it off to a smalltown mind that 
dabbles in writing newspaper articles 
the newspaper has published several editorials denouncing the 
theaters action and urged supporters to picket the movie house 
about a dozen people recently showed up with picket signs one read 
big screen small mind 
meanwhile palo verde valley times publisher glen sparlin said 
that since ms monnett will not review rrated movies he is 
considering using another critic to complement his family film 
reviewer

the leader of last months 
military revolt managed to keep his credit current even behind bars 
renewing an american express card in prison so he could cover his 
wifes vacation a newspaper said thursday 
col mohamed ali seineldin is enjoying more privileges than most 
prison inmates and many argentines in general other sources said 
on condition of anonymity 
he has his own telephone and a private secretary to coordinate 
his steady stream of visitors and he even was allowed to spend 
christmas eve at another prison so he could toast his fellow 
insurgents the sources said 
seineldin led a fourday rebellion by more than 800 soldiers that 
included a siege at a military school outside buenos aires the 
insurgents surrendered on dec 5 
on tuesday seineldin telephoned the american express office in 
buenos aires and asked for a renewal on his credit card so he could 
cover his wifes vacation to chile the newspaper pagina 12 reported 
thursday 
a company representative drove to the suburban buenos aires 
military base where seineldin is being held and waited while the 
colonel completed the paperwork the paper reported 
several hours later approval was granted and mrs seineldin 
picked up the card the paper said such speedy approvals are 
reserved only for vip clients it said noting that prisoners 
usually have difficulty getting credit let alone credit cards 
contacted by the associated press american express issued a 
statement that said we believe that the relationship between 
american express and those individuals who possess the american 
express card is confidential 
this policy of privacy is applied in an equal manner with each 
one of our 30 million members

magdalena military prison 62 miles south of buenos aires to toast 
the holiday with officers jailed there the sources said 
critics of president raul alfonsin say the government made a deal 
with rebels to end the insurrection rather than force their 
unconditional surrender 
many loyal commanders said afterward they agreed with demands 
made by rebels for an end to the prosecutions of officers for human 
rights abuses during the military dictatorships of the 1970s some 
sort of public affirmation that the brutal crackdown in which at 
least 8900 argentines were executed was legitimite and a bigger 
military budget

mobile put its art deco art nouveau funhouse decor on the auction 
block thursday 
the cafe closed july 10 after 22 years in business 
deal maker donald trump bought a leaded glass window for 26800 
the stained glass window featuring two peacocks against a blue 
background was designed from tiffany favrile glass by the 
restaurants owner warner leroy

prime minister yitzhak shamir on thursday denied 
published reports that he decided to fire the head of israels famed 
mossad secret service after a sixyear tenure characterized as 
mediocre and passive 
the head of the mossad has not been dismissed shamir said in 
a rare public comment on the secret service he is finishing his 
assignment as planned it has even been extended 
all the articles that were printed concerning the head of the 
mossad are untrue and baseless he has done extraordinary work 
he enjoys the confidence of the government and my full trust and 
confidence shamir said 
unprecedented public debate about the mossad followed a supreme 
court decision tuesday overuling the military censor and allowing 
the tel aviv weekly newspaper hair to run an article on the mossad 
the article is to run in fridays editions the associated press 
obtained an advance copy 
hair quoting foreign newspaper reports said the mossad head 
was responsible for events leading to the expulsion of five israeli 
agents from britain last september in another incident mossad 
agents in west germany left forged passports in a telephone booth 
the article said 
author aluf ben described the head of the mossad as a mediocre 
and manipulative bureaucrat who worked his way up by outlasting more 
outstanding competitors 
the mossad head named in foreign reports as nahum adnoni was 
appointed in september 1982 as a lastminute fillin for gen 
yekutiel adam who was the first choice of thenprime minister 
menahem begin but was killed in the lebanon war ben wrote 
the new chief had been deputy mossad chief and had spent most 
of his years far from any operations and had not guided any 
agents ben wrote 
his main goal as head of mossad was to hang on to his job by 
avoiding mistakes the article said he didnt initiate operations 
and preferred to leave the ship in port 
he was so eager to avoid complications that he accepted 
intrusions into his territory such as the decision of thenprime 
minister shimon peres in 198586 to enlist his personal aides rather 
than the mossad in selling arms to iran the article said 
ben said the search for a new chief began months ago one of the 
two main contenders is from outside the agency and the other rose 
through the ranks he wrote 
shamir was expected to make his choice within days israeli 
newspapers said he favored the candidate within the agency noting 
that shamir was with the mossad in the 1950s and 1960s 
shamir on thursday criticized the public debate over the mossad 
chief saying he and the agency he heads have been caused a great 
deal of sorrow

a jury found k mart inc the nations 
secondlargest retailer liable for 24 million damages for selling 
a shotgun to an intoxicated man who later shot and paralyzed another 
man with it 
the state supreme court jury in niagara county made the award 
tuesday to the estate of thomas viscomi and his widow norma 
viscomi of niagara falls 
viscomi was shot in the back in 1979 by john hoopsick who held a 
longtime grudge against him and who hours earlier purchased the 
shotgun and ammunition at a k mart store in niagara falls 
terry smith a lawyer for the widow said the stores sales clerk 
should have known not to sell the weapon to hoopsick who was 
described as obviously drunk and agitated at the time 
smith said the award was the first in new york state where a jury 
has held a store liable for selling a weapon to a drunken person 
although federal firearms regulations prohibit the sale of guns 
to minors illegal aliens people with drug dependencies and mental 
deficiencies there is no prohibition against sales to people who 
are drunk he said 
smith said there have been a number of successful civil cases 
against gun retailers in other states including a recent judgment 
against k mart in a similar case in st claire shores mich 
leslie kota a spokeswoman for k mart based in troy mich said 
the company would appeal the ruling 
k marts lawyers had argued that hoopsick was not visibly 
intoxicated and that the sales clerk couldnt have known what 
hoopsick planned to do with the weapon 
k mart has 15 days to file a posttrial motion in the triallevel 
state supreme court 
on dec 4 1979 viscomi then 59 was shot with a 12gauge 
shotgun after returning home from work one of the pellets from the 
shotgun blast damaged viscomis spinal cord and he was left 
paralyzed from the waist smith said 
hoopsick was sentenced to five years probation after pleading 
guilty to charges in march 1981 viscomi died of a heart attack on 
june 28 1986 according to smith 
the case was originally tried in november 1986 and k mart was 
found negligent in the selling the shotgun the jury award the 
viscomis 500000 
k mart was unsuccessful in getting a state appellate court to 
overturn the finding the next year 
the oneweek trial that ended tuesday was limited to damages only

a medical assistant who tried to perform 
liposuction but wound up killing her best friend instead was 
sentenced thursday to 45 days in jail and four years of intensive 
probation 
stacy lin bickel 25 of tempe pleaded guilty in november to 
negligent homicide in the death of deborah sue tomazin 24 of 
phoenix 
she admitted giving miss tomazin an unintentionally lethal dose 
of anesthetic while trying to prepare her for the medical procedure 
in which fatty cells are sucked from the body 
the bungled attempt took place march 27 in the office of miss 
bickels former employer tempe plastic surgeon richard pavese 
maricopa county superior court judge lindsay ellis also ordered 
miss bickel to pay 5500 in restitution to miss tomazins family 
and to perform 40 hours per week of community service indefinitely 
a clerk for ms ellis said intensive probation amounted to house 
arrest requiring written approval in advance of any 
outsidetheresidence activity 
miss bickel will be able to work the clerk said but it was not 
known if she had regained employment since she was fired 
detectives said miss tomazin who died march 30 agreed to 
undergo liposuction at the hands of her friend who had assisted 
pavese in many operations and felt confident she could carry out the 
procedure

the head of mexicos powerful oil workers 
union was arraigned thursday on homicide and arms charges as forces 
in the governing party began moving to install leaders more 
sympathetic to president carlos salinas de gortari 
a bomb threat and rumors of more arrests forced union local 
chiefs to evacuate the unions national headquarters before they 
could vote to confirm the choice of a new secretarygeneral 
judicial police searched the building 
joaquin hernandez galicia and 50 other union leaders and 
associates were arrested tuesday and wednesday thousands of oil 
workers demonstrated in protest thursday night in mexico citys 
zocalo plaza 
a source in the attorney generals office said former reynosa 
mayor jose cruz contreras was suspected of smuggling arms shipments 
for hernandez galicia from the united states and officials were 
looking for him 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said mexican and 
us law enforcement officials met thursday to try to determine the 
origin of a weapons cache found in hernandez galicias home 
the source said mexican officials suspected that drugs may have 
been used to pay for the weapons 
he said hernandez galicia faces up to 40 years in prison if 
convicted 
in a mexico city prison thursday hernandez galicia told 
reporters they told me my family was kidnapped and if i didnt 
give a statement that pleased the federal attorney general i 
wouldnt see them again 
he called his detention a dirty prefabricated infamy still 
he urged oil workers to stay on the job 
on wednesday sen ricardo camero cardiel was named union 
secretarygeneral for 30 days he replaces salvador barragan 
camacho who turned himself in after hernandez galicia was arrested 
and barragan camachos house was searched 
barragan camacho who has a history of heart trouble is under 
arrest in a hospital 
the daily newspaper la jornada said camero cardiel with more 
than 30 years of union activity is a recognized member of 
hernandez galicias group 
camero cardiel pledged to use all legal means to win the 
freedom of hernandez barragan and other arrested leaders the 
newspaper said 
government sources said union rules were not followed in the 
selection of camero cardiel and indicated it was likely he would not 
remain in the post 
the authentic workers and there are thousands of them will be 
able to work better with the company and strengthen pemex the 
state oil monopoly under a new leadership a government source said 
on condition of anonymity 
labor secretary arsenio farell cubillas objected to the election 
of cardiel saying that union bylaws require that the unions 
interior secretary jose melendez maranto should replace barragan 
camacho 
the government feels melendez would be more sympathetic to 
president carlos salinas de gortari who has long feuded with the 
unions powerful innner circle 
but union spokesman fernando arreola said that farell cubillas 
obviously does not know the unions bylaws 
arreola said an extraordinary session of more than 90 percent of 
local representatives chose cardiel for the remainder of barragan 
camachos fiveyear term 
he said melendez could have been selected under union bylaws but 
that because it was not known how long barragan camacho would be 
away they picked cardiel 
the oil workers union like most of the labor movement is 
closely tied to the government but hernandez galicia known by his 
nickname la quina has a longstanding dispute with salinas 
the arrest of la quina and 50 others in a violent raid continued 
to draw criticism thursday even from governmentlinked unions and 
their leaders 
the labor congress issued a statement wednesday saying it 
strongly protests the violence used and called for the freedom 
of those arrested 
soldiers blew down the door of hernandez galicias home and a 
federal agent was killed in the ensuing gunbattle 
leaders of the mexican labor federation the countrys largest 
labor federation and the labor congress a governmentaligned 
organization of nearly all the countrys unions met thursday with 
salinas 
a statement from the presidency said the meetings were 
traditional new years calls and did not mention the arrests 
veteran labor federation leader fidel velazquez did not speak with 
reporters after the meeting 
in a second statement salinas expressed solidarity with 
velazquez and the labor movement 
hernandez galicia who held only a minor union office but has 
been its unofficial boss for years was charged with homicide 
possession of large quantitites of weapons importing prohibited 
weapons and resisting authority said fernando arias perez an 
attorney generals office spokesman 
authorities have said more than 200 uzi submachine guns were 
found in hernandez galicias home when he was arrested tuesday in 
ciudad madero about 220 miles northeast of mexico city on the gulf 
of mexico 
he told investigators uzis and about 30000 cartridges were 
secretly delivered to him on dec 10 and were to defend his union 
members given the existing situation in the country the attorney 
generals office said 
arias perez said 50 other people arrested face charges of fraud 
weapons and tax evasion

president reagan says hes handing the nation 
over to the good hands of george bush advising his successor to 
keep a wary eye on the soviet union and warning against an erosion 
of the american spirit 
in a folksy oval office speech bidding adieu to the nation 
reagan boasted wednesday of his accomplishments and ignored many of 
the difficulties that arose during his eight years in office 
we meant to change a nation and instead we changed a world 
he said 
yet reagan also admitted that his selfstyled conservative 
revolution left many things unchanged and he asked his followers to 
stick around and help his successor

us airlines have three days to check for 
crosswiring in 300 boeing 737s following speculation that faulty 
warnings deceived the pilot of a british 737 into shutting down his 
only good engine when the other one caught fire 
we think this is not a very likely scenario but its a check 
that can be done very very quickly without disrupting service 
said federal aviation administration spokesman john leyden 
the faa order late wednesday applies to eight piedmont airlines 
737400s with usfrench cfm56 engines similar to the british 
midland airways 737 that crashed sunday in england killing 44 
people it also would cover 292 smaller boeing 737300s operated by 
10 us airlines 
no planes were grounded by the order and other 737s and other 
planes using the cfm56 engines would not be affected

the soviet union says it will try to maintain its 
miniscule aids rate by screening foreigners for the deadly virus 
even forcing mandatory tests of some visitors who cannot provide 
proper medical proof 
foreigners who want to stay in the country for three months or 
more will be subject to testing for the disease beginning next 
month foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
here there cannot be any discrimination gerasimov said 
we conduct tests of our own people and besides statistics show 
the soviet union is sharply lagging behind other countries say the 
united states in the number of ill people with aids and we just 
dont want to catch up 
the soviets once regarded aids as a disease spawned by western 
sexual depravity and drug use one soviet newspapers account had 
even claimed the virus was the result of a us biological warfare 
experiment gone haywire

mikhail baryshnikov danced in george balanchines 
new york city ballet for only one year a decade ago but it made a 
lasting impression 
the superstar of ballet dances tonight on pbs in two ballets 
apollo and who cares created by balanchine this centurys 
master choreographer 
baryshnikov dances balanchine is the first offering in the 
13th season of dance in america presented by great 
performances on the public broadcasting service 
asked the most important thing he learned from balanchine the 
dancer said in a telephone interview i wish i could say he taught 
me how to choreograph that would be the best thing 
i learned from him a lot he was a very extraordinary man and i 
had a lot of fun to be with him 
he says he doesnt have a favorite balanchine ballet theyre 
all pretty incredible 
apollo is about the birth of the god his realization of his 
divinity and his early education in the power of the arts by the 
muses of dance poetry and mime the muses are danced by christine 
dunham leslie browne and stephanie saland of american ballet 
theater 
apollo was balanchines first of many collaborations with 
composer igor stravinsky he created apollo in 1928 and it is 
his earliest ballet that is still regularly danced 
baryshnikov had danced apollo under balanchines guidance he 
did not dance for him in who cares which balanchine created for 
the new york city ballet in 1970 after baryshnikov had left the 
company 
for who cares set to 18 songs by george gershwin 
balanchines choreography is lighthearted plotless and elegant 
its a style which suits baryshnikov an admirer of fred astaire 
baryshnikov deirdre carberry miss browne and miss dunham dance to 
eight of the songs on tv 
speaking of balanchines neoclassic style in which traditional 
ballet steps and phrases are used in innovative ways baryshnikov 
said what balanchine has done for ballet is he opened to all 
choreographers future possibilities he showed what can be done with 
that kind of music movement ideas and aesthetics 
he pushed the ballet finally to the level of all visual art 
music and poetry otherwise ballet would have been dragging a 
century behind everything else 
on the tv show baryshnikov calls dancing for balanchine the 
experience of a lifetime and he talks about how he felt when 
balanchine praised him 
after the performance i was lucky to get i mean sometimes 
a good review from him and it was just one word and he 
just opened your dressing room and said excellent good night 
you know and went home and stars are shining you know for you 
baryshnikov first saw apollo when he was 11 or 12 in his 
native riga latvia it was danced by alicia alonsos company from 
cuba he first met balanchine in 1972 when the new york city ballet 
toured the soviet union 
in 1974 when he was 26 baryshnikov defected to the west in 
toronto while on a tour of canada with a group of dancers from the 
bolshoi ballet a kirov ballet dancer since he was 18 baryshnikov 
was acclaimed by the soviet public and critics he was the youngest 
star to receive the state merit of the ussr but he felt the need 
of artistic freedom to dance something beside the princes in 
such ballet staples as swan lake and the sleeping beauty 
ballerina natalia makarova a frequent partner at the kirov 
before she defected to the west during the 1970 tour led 
baryshnikov to american ballet theater 
he had been with the abt just long enough to be looking for still 
further challenges when balanchine heard about his restlessness and 
invited him to join the new york city ballet balanchine invited 
baryshnikov to his apartment the dancer recalls during the 
television program he opened the door he said you dont mind 
if i continue doing what i do i said sure he was ironing his 
shirts and we started to talk 
when baryshnikov was asked to return to american ballet theater 
as artistic director he said i discussed with him balanchine 
he suggested i would do that it was friendly absolutely i moved 
back to ballet theater with his blessing you know 
baryshnikov and the american ballet theater ballerinas went to 
denmark where the program a coproduction of wnet in new york and 
danmarks radio was filmed they have a good facility there and a 
good crew i had a good time baryshnikov said 
i hope the audience will enjoy the program what else can i 
say

tokyo is a long way from sesame street but 
big bird and barkley have a pretty good time in japan after 
learning some lessons about homesickness international friendship 
and respect for different cultures 
the onehour special big bird in japan airs monday on pbs 
it was filmed on location in tokyo and kyoto and is a coproduction 
of childrens television worship and nhk network in japan 
arriving in japan on an overly organized tour they have five 
minutes to see tokyo big bird and barkley miss the bus after 
becoming enthralled by all the people with black hair from 
cleveland they later learn among other things that ohio is 
japanese for good morning 
the two big muppets wander the strange city alone prompting big 
bird to sing a song about homesickness but a friendly young 
japanese woman maiko kawakami befriends them 
what kind of tour would abandon a bird and a dog in a strange 
country she wonders 
probably the same kind of tour that would take a bird and a dog 
along in the first place big bird suggests 
she promises to help the two get to kyoto where they can hook up 
with the tour again and head for home 
along the way big bird uses chopsticks learns that he should 
take off his shoes if he has any before entering a japanese home 
tries to fit on futon and learns a few japanese words at least 
on sesame street i knew the alphabet he sighs after trying to 
decipher the japanese street signs 
jon stone wrote and directed the special there is a storyline 
about the mysterious young woman perhaps being the the bamboo 
princess of japanese legend 
sesame street is seen in japanese schools where it teaches 
english to high school and junior high school students in the 
special big bird and barkley visit an elementary school 
the special has already aired once in japan and will be repeated 
ctw says it was a hit getting three times nhk networks usual 
rating for educational programs

his optimism was out of style with much of the 
investment community and the economic fraternity throughout his term 
in office but in retrospect his view seems justified by the results 
the dow jones industrial average produced a 16 percent average 
compound investment return during his two terms and the bond 
markets 10 percent real rate of total return was the best for any 
presidency since warren hardings 
as the president said in his farewell address we werent just 
marking time we made a difference 
a great many of the investment talent in wall street and the 
economic brains of academe and business didnt really believe him 
though and you can find it imprinted on their record year after 
year during the 1980s 
while he exuded hope they issued warnings 
it was a regular ritual when the annual white house economic 
forecast was issued it was instantly discounted as overly 
optimistic sometimes it was but maybe it was intentional a 
challenge to work for rather than an easy mark 
throughout eight years the warnings came from wall street about 
inflation recession monetary collapse niggardly corporate 
earnings the weaknesses of the manufacturing sector the budget 
deficits disaster seemed imminent 
maybe president reagan was lucky to escape the disasters and 
there are grounds for believing that some of the financial 
disappointments of his administration might adversely affect the 
economy for years to come 
still there was a job to be done when he entered office and it 
couldnt wait the recession of the early 1980s was by some measures 
the worst since the great depression of the 1930s moreover 
confidence was shot 
the great american manufacturing machine was in its own private 
depression outmatched both domestically and abroad by newer 
entrants in the world marketplace inflation roared interest rates 
were high faith was a feather 
it was so bad president jimmy carter had referred to the american 
people as suffering from a malaise optimism wasnt in the picture 
but it was put there nothing does it like economic progress or the 
belief that it will come 
interest rates began a long decline from a prime above 18 
percent in 1981 to under 8 percent by the mid1980s inflation came 
down from the double digits to under 4 percent economic activity 
surged disposable personal income shot from a gain of less than 1 
percent in 1982 to 59 percent in 1984 profits ascended from minus 
27 percent in 1982 to plus 22 percent in 1983 more than 19 million 
jobs were created and filled 3 million of them in 1988 alone 
rusty from disuse the american manufacturing sector was 
resurrected and became competitive again almost stagnant and 
sometimes falling during the previous two decades manufacturing 
labor productivity grew at an annual rate of nearly 35 percent from 
1986 through the third quarter of 1988 more than 400000 jobs were 
created in manufacturing in both 1987 and 1988 and much of the 
increased production was sent overseas helping to lower the trade 
deficit 
you might never have guessed some of these achievements if you 
placed credence in the threats warnings caveats criticisms 
advisories and the like that accompanied daily weekly and monthly 
analyses from research departments 
maybe it was just a ritualistic rite to distract the demons 
somebody believed otherwise the economy couldnt have done what it 
did stocks couldnt have risen for instance and reagan couldnt 
have been reelected 
the president believed and it was contagious

boyd l jefferies used to thrive on four hours of 
sleep a night arriving for work at 130 am and staying until 
evening to command the aggressive stocktrading desk of the 
brokerage that bears his name 
now the 58yearold exbroker spends much of his time with 
defense lawyers and federal investigators chainsmoking cigarettes 
answering questions and wondering when he will get back to his 
passion on the 33rd floor of a downtown los angeles skyscraper 
buying and selling big blocks of stock 
a criminal courtroom has replaced his sprawling trading desk the 
tension of interrogation has replaced the thrill of stock 
speculation the priority of avoiding jail time has replaced the 
obsession with serving clients 
once spectacularly successful widely admired and courted by 
almost every big takeover strategist jefferies has been transformed 
over the last two years into what gangsters might call the biggest 
canary in his business 
he is the leading prosecution witness in at least three major 
fraud cases that arose indirectly from the man who squealed on him 
ivan f boesky the stock speculator and inside trader now serving a 
threeyear prison term 
in exchange for lenient treatment jefferies agreed with federal 
prosecutors in march 1987 to plead guilty to two violations of 
securities laws cooperate in other investigations resign from his 
brokerage jefferies amp co and stay out of the securities business 
for at least five years 
yes i miss it jefferies said standing outside a manhattan 
federal courtroom on a break in his recent witnessstand debut in 
the stockmanipulation case against gaf corp and a top company 
officer 
he declined to elaborate and spent much of the break in a witness 
waiting room puffing benson amp hedges 100s chewing gum and slowly 
pacing the floor he looked tan and fit in a darkblue business 
suit but his blue eyes were slightly bloodshot and he seldom smiled 
heres a guy who used to get up at 130 in the morning to go 
work said james p linn jefferies lawyer its not easy for a 
man whos worked like that to stand around in a federal courthouse 
nevertheless life isnt that bad for jefferies he remains 
fabulously wealthy and owns expensive homes in indian wells calif 
and aspen colo which he shares with his wife he spends much of 
his time on the telephone to keep abreast of the market though he 
generally refrains from calling his colleagues at the company linn 
said 
i suppose hes allowed to call but the company doesnt like 
for him to so he doesnt the lawyer said in an interview 
a good golfer jefferies has started a scholarship program in 
aspen for aspiring young golf amateurs although defense lawyers 
have tried to claim this generosity is meant to impress the judge 
who ultimately will sentence him linn denied that 
the fact is boyd jefferies had a son killed in an accident he 
is passionately involved with young people having lost his son 
linn said he has no ulterior motive in doing his golf deal 
jefferies punishment remains unclear but is expected to be far 
less than the maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and 
500000 in fines he faces for pleading guilty to one count of 
violating stockmargin requirements and one count of aiding and 
abetting to keep false books 
he even suggested on the witness stand in crossexamination by 
defense attorneys in the gaf trial that he doesnt expect to serve 
any prison time 
to a large extent the severity of the sentence will depend on 
the fruits of his cooperation which were bruised this past week 
when a federal judge decreed a mistrial in the gaf case because the 
prosecution mishandled a key piece of evidence 
aside from his involvement in gaf jefferies is a leading witness 
in securities fraud prosecutions against paul bilzerian a 
floridabased takeover speculator and salim b lewis a new 
yorkbased securities professional both are former jefferies 
clients 
linn and other associates of jefferies have tried to portray him 
as a man so driven to serve his customers that he crossed the bounds 
of legality on their behalf not out of personal avarice 
many big investors have expressed faith in him such as texas 
oilman t boone pickens and minneapolis takeover strategist irwin 
jacobs but jefferies lawyer conceded that other clients might feel 
betrayed by a trusted broker who later turned states evidence in a 
major criminal investigation 
yes i suppose there would be some of those people linn 
said but boyd still has a very loyal and large following he did 
a lot of things for a lot of people 
jefferies rapid rise generosity and crashing downfall are part 
of the folklore of the 1980s takeover boom a ucla graduate and 
former ranch hand he started in the securities business by landing 
an entrylevel job at a small brokerage quit six years later and 
founded his own firm with two employees 
by early this decade jefferies amp co had swelled to more than 
400 employees with a large trading center in los angeles five 
other offices nationwide and one in london 
it became known as the leading firm where investors could trade 
big blocks of stock quickly and discreetly without going through 
conventional stock exchanges 
jefferies was said to delight in making markets for highprofile 
stocks and the positions he took in wellknown targets sometimes 
determined the outcome of takeover battles 
in late 1986 for example jefferies helped torontobased campeau 
corp acquire allied stores corp by selling the canadian developer 
a large block of its allied holdings for more than 17 billion 
part of the attraction for takeover investors was jefferies 
policy of absolute confidentiality and extraordinary accommodation 
in doing business at their convenience no matter when 
jacobs once said he could call the company as early as 3 am and 
jefferies would answer the telephone having arrived early to trade 
european stocks 
there were no such things as hours for boyd jacobs said 
you could find boyd seven days a week 24 hours a day 
despite predictions that his brokerage would falter following his 
plea agreement jefferies amp co continues to be an aggressive trader 
and he intends to return there when his legal ordeal finally ends 
linn said 
hes lost without that business that business literally was 
his life the lawyer said

once a little city with clean if rainy skies and 
clear mountain views fastgrowing seattle has become a metropolis 
with the usual smog and traffic jams some people are starting to 
protest 
a citizens group turned in 18000 signatures on an initiative to 
limit the height and density of downtown buildings and debate is 
gearing up before a vote this spring 
the building boom is easy to see and much of it has occurred in 
the past decade three skyscrapers are under construction and 
permit applications for three more were submitted before a recently 
imposed sixmonth moratorium on downtown growth 
the 55story washington mutual tower was completed last year 
bumping the 50story 1001 fourth avenue plaza to third tallest no 
1 is the west coasts tallest building the 76story blackglass 
columbia seafirst center built in 1985 before downtown zoning went 
into effect a dozen office towers are 30 stories or more and all 
but three were opened in the 1980s 
the thousands of workers in these buildings plus tourists and 
shoppers make downtown seattle a lively place 
fishmongers farmers stalls crafts booths and restaurants 
compete shouldertoshoulder at the historic hectic pike place 
market 
redevelopment is continuing at the downtown waterfront and the 
downtown retail core with major flagship department stores and a 
variety of small businesses recently settled one 30yearold 
landuse debate with the opening of westlake center a new mall of 
expensive shops and a 24story office tower 
supporters of the citizens alternative plan to downtown 
development or cap say overdevelopment in downtown will mean more 
pollution as more people commute by car and more boxlike apartment 
buildings replace singlefamily houses and dilute the flavor of old 
city neighborhoods 
cap wants to limit building height to about 40 stories in the 
office district new office floor space would be limited to 500000 
square feet a year for the next five years and 1 million square feet 
a year from 1995 through 1999 after that the ceiling would be 
lifted unless reimposed by the city council 
by contrast nearly 6 million square feet of downtown office 
space is newly completed under construction or has received city 
permits said virginia galle a city council member and cap 
supporter 
at the present rate of growth in 10 years some 67000 new office 
workers are expected to occupy 52000 new households and make 29000 
more car trips daily into downtown she said 
there is no height limit under the citys current zoning plan a 
buildings size is worked out according to a formula based on the 
size of the site with extra height allowed in exchange for such 
amenities as plazas retail space and day care centers 
cap supporters insist they want growth but not at a high cost to 
the environment and the neighborhoods 
were not antigrowth in the traditional sense says patrick 
strosahl a jeweler and president of vision seattle which supports 
cap were really much more into shaping growth so that it 
produces and accentuates the livability of the city 
some participants in the growth debate argue the city needs 
controls that are more lenient than the cap initiative 
mayor charles royer presented a plan of his own that would limit 
office towers to about 50 stories it would stiffen the zoning code 
but not as much as cap would 
royer also wants to adjust the bonus system used to allow 
developers to build higher his plan would shift the emphasis of the 
bonuses from streetlevel amenities to housing human services and 
open space 
the downtown seattle association a group of developers and 
business executives contends the 1985 zoning law is strict enough 
john gilmore president of the association says downtown growth 
makes more sense than spreading development into neighborhods and 
suburbs a downtown provides a focal point for a rapidtransit 
system something seattle needs he said and seattle must grow he 
contended were having childen like every other part of the 
country and theres got to be jobs 
folke nyberg a professor of urban planning and architecture at 
the university of washington agreed seattles location on the 
pacific rim means it will grow but disagreed that concentrated 
downtown growth is good 
seattle has an hourglass figure squeezed between puget 
sound and lake washington he said so there are some very limited 
physical constraints that makes it imperative that we have an 
effective transportation solution before we allow growth to happen 
and this was not done 
a better way to grow nyberg said would be in decentralized 
clusters throughout the region people in these smaller cities would 
live near their jobs and go to downtown seattle mainly for 
conventions and cultural events 
instead unplanned growth can be seen in declining air quality 
traffic congestion and more homelessness caused by a lack of 
afforable housing he said 
seattle which has been a very livable city he said failed 
to learn from other cities mistakes asked why he replied its 
all greed 
the growthcontrol initiative goes before voters may 16 the city 
council decided last week 
gilmore of the downtown seattle association said that the 
citys 1985 downtown zoning was the product of four years of debate 
and that any changes should be made through more hearings and city 
council votes the american institute of architects local chapter 
agrees 
cap supporters however say their plan is reasonable and timely 
according to strosahl san francisco needed to enact stiffer 
downtown limits in 1986 because it waited too long until the cost 
of housing went way up and the character of the city changed 
san francisco voters approved the limits after a building spree 
in which 25 million square feet of office space was added between 
1979 and 1984 the high rises nearly blocked out all the sun in san 
franciscos financial district 
san franciscos voterapproved plan limits new office space to 
475000 square feet for several years for a city with a population 
of 690000 that compares with caps limits of 500000 square feet 
for five years and 1 million square feet for the next five in a city 
of 490000 
gilmore suggests people who signed cap did not really want to 
limit growth but were just annoyed with traffic disruption downtown 
caused by construction of a downtown bus tunnel and a state 
convention center the initiative text was long and complicated and 
people probably did not read it he said 
whats more the petition had just 329 more signatures than it 
needed 
strosahl thinks voters will pass the initiative but he expects a 
highly financed campaign against it

a hint of revolution is in the air in at least 
some bigcity school systems an apparent readiness at long last 
to stop bickering and start reforming 
the nations largest system new york city continues to generate 
shocking headlines about violence drugs and widespread neighborhood 
school board corruption within the last month an elementary school 
principal and three teachers were picked up on drug charges and 
last week a kindergartner was found with a 25caliber pistol 
but the picture has begun to brighten elsewhere 
in pittsburgh dade county fla and rochester ny teacher 
unions and school administrators have beaten their swords into 
reformminded contracts that boost teacher pay and power while 
making them directly accountable for their students performance 
in detroit where the dropout rate is at least 40 percent fed up 
voters elected a reform school board slate in november they also 
refused to approve new school taxes and bonds aimed at paying off an 
estimated 158 million deficit 
there are even hopeful signs in chicagos schools branded 14 
months ago as the nations worst by us secretary of education 
william j bennett illinois gov james thompson signed legislation 
last month scrapping chicagos central school board next july to be 
replaced by parentrun councils empowered to set budgets and hire 
and fire principals 
that hardly means such cities have solved their school problems 
officials are quick to admit 
chicagos new governing structure may lead to unprecedented 
parent power but the basic problems still fester a 45 percent 
dropout rate and belowaverage standardized test scores 
as rochester teacher union leader adam urbanski put it we have 
set the table we have not served the meal yet 
hopeful signs are scarce in the 960000student new york city 
system 
its true that new yorks state legislature recently passed 
longsought bills clearing the way for desperately needed school 
construction and making new rules to curb school board patronage 
but schools chancellor richard green whose muchheralded arrival 
as an outsider from minneapolis last march raised hopes for new 
approaches has instead found himself tangled in investigations of 
local school board corruption 
to some new york remains a system adrift 
at this point there are a lot of people putting out ideas and 
a lot of people wringing their hands we have to have the 
administration put out a specific plan so that people can get behind 
it said robin willner deputy executive director of interface a 
watchdog group that issues frequent reports on city school issues 
all of which raises the question what does it take to put the 
nations largest school systems on the road to reform 
relative size and the power of the purse are certainly key 
factors says samuel l husk executive director of the council of 
great city schools pittsburgh for example has only 40000 
students and its school board has taxing authority 
new york city has 25 times more students and its school board 
has no authority to tax its size and tangled politics foster a 
feeling of hopelessness some now openly wonder how many 
drugaddicted principals and teachers it will take to finally jolt 
the system 
i think that you need a catalyst i hate to say it has to be 
horrible unfortunately in a school system this size it may have to 
be said willner 
new orleans 80000student public schools have an additional 
disadvantage they must compete with a popular 35000student 
parochial school system that siphons off political support 
but all cities have obstacles to overcome whether they succeed 
in reform or even attempt it usually depends on someone in 
authority willing to lead the charge 
you need leadership at the top those at the top and those in 
the private sector have to see it as an absolute emergency its a 
political problem said ernest l boyer a national spokesman for 
reform and president of the carnegie foundation for the advancement 
of teaching which has produced several reports on urban school 
problems 
in rochester and pittsburgh new superintendents have made a 
difference 
rochesters peter mcwalters named in 1986 signaled willingness 
to form a working partnership with teachers under a contract that 
took effect this year each teacher is directly responsible for 20 
students holding daily meetings and home visits where necessary in 
return top teacher salaries will rise to 70000 and schoolbased 
planning teams consisting of teachers parents students and 
principals will set goals for each school 
when mcwalters came in he shared my sense of urgency and he 
was devoid of the baggage and inhibitions that management often 
has said urbanski his passion proved infectious after our 
collective bargaining agreement we had left little choice for the 
political and business structure but to follow suit to help us make 
it work 
pittsburghs superintendent richard c wallace who arrived in 
1980 as an outsider to a city enmeshed in a bitter dispute over 
school desegregation helped move the school system beyond that 
dispute and establish it as a national model of reform he promptly 
began biweekly meetings with the teacher union established a center 
to enhance teacher skills and attracted millions in corporate funds 
to support innovative programs 
likewise in miamis dade county the teacher union and 
superintendent have stopped fighting and started cooperating to 
devise a reform plan 
but the key factor was leadership said husk the thing to 
remember is florida had an education governor bob graham and he 
made a substantial investment in schools long before other states 
were even thinking about reform 
some feel new york is still waiting for such leadership 
we dont have any one elective official who has made education 
their primary issue said willner in terms of using the bully 
pulpit having an education mayor or governor that hasnt happened 
in new york 
in new orleans meanwhile the bad times keep rolling for a 
school system perennially starved of leadership and tax dollars 
still many are encouraged by the election last year of louisianas 
reformminded governor buddy roemer a property tax increase last 
april and a new expanded school board 
that may not be enough a state report showed that 370 of new 
orleans 4800teacher staff were either uncertified or had 
temporary certificates and despite recent increases salaries still 
average just 26800 about 2000 below the national average 
the new orleans public schools remain a factory for the 
expansion of the underclass said lee gary a private education 
consultant 
boyer sees four elements necessary to move big systems toward 
reform clearly stated goals smaller schools structured so that 
students no longer feel anonymous more schoolbased authority where 
officials are regularly accountable for results and above all 
partnerships between parents civic corporate and educational 
officials 
if you pull these reform efforts apart these cities are making 
progress on governance and partnerships said boyer what i 
dont see is much attention to school climate student alienation 
and the question of educational goals and outcomes

vice president george bush stretched back in 
his office chair at ease as he reflected on the power and the 
problems awaiting him when the v word is erased from his title and 
im president im the one whos calling the shots 
with exhilaration tempered by this deficit looming over 
everything bush takes office at noon friday convinced there is 
neither a need nor a mandate for dramatic change to put his imprint 
on the white house 
automatically that happens he said with the transfer of 
power from ronald reagans 40th presidency to his 41st 
as keynotes to the bush era the last eight years are likely to 
weigh far more heavily than the first hundred days 
ive been a part of this administration and it isnt like there 
is a need for radical change the presidentelect said in an 
interview in his vice presidential office across a narrow private 
street from the white house 
his transition teams have gone throughout the government to 
prepare for the new administration but its different not like 
those he met as cia director in 1976 when jimmy carters advance 
guard arrived saying were going to find out whats wrong here and 
change it different too from the teams we sent sallying forth 
in 1980 to go out and undo all the bad things that we had campaigned 
against 
in contrast bush believes his administration needs to correct 
one big problem the federal deficit then build on some 
tremendous successes of the reagan years 
thats at least the approach that im going to bring to the 
job he said sipping a cup of chinese tea people 
understood that when they were voting they werent looking for a 
radical shift that last thought was a refrain throughout the 
conversation 
bush said he envisions no single theme for his first hundred 
days no centerpiece drive like the one that won approval of 
president reagans tax cut economic plan in 1981 the initial months 
usually are the strongest season in a first term and the most 
promising for congressional acceptance of proposals from a new 
administration that goes double for a republican president seeking 
action in a democratic congress 
the new president will set out his agenda in his inaugural 
address on friday and in an address to congress early next month he 
said the message will not be one of major overhaul for very 
obvious reasons ive been a part of what we have been doing what 
this president the present president has accomplished 
the tie to reagan was on his mind as he performed one of his last 
vice presidential duties presiding over the kind of antiquated 
drill in which congress counted the electoral votes that made him 
president 
i was thinking well this is historically interesting 
because this is a continuation hopefully building theres going to 
be change but hopefully a building on whats happened 
inevitably then comes the question of how this new president 
can put his imprint on an administration he heralds as a 
continuation of what reagan began 
style message people be yourself bush said i made 
my mind up as vice president to do my job one way but im not vice 
president im president im the one whos calling the shots im 
the one whos going to set the agenda 
so automatically that happens that happens at the time when i 
put my hand on that bible and hold my right hand in the air and say 
that oath it happens 
bush said the successs and problems of presidential leadership 
will continue to be identified with reagan for a short time but 
in a while six months from now that will be identified with me 
for all the problems that will be on his new desk on saturday 
morning bush said he is excited about the task and eager to 
confront the agenda 
if it werent for this deficit looming over everything else 
leave all the rest of the problems in there id feel like a spring 
colt he said

when george carlins comedy routine on the 
seven dirty words was broadcast by a radio station in 1978 it 
prompted a us supreme court ruling on indecency 
a decade later a character on the hit network sitcom designing 
women used a derivative of one of those words in describing 
another character who was obsessed with enlarging her bosom 
no it isnt just imagination network standards are loosening up 
the networks are being more lenient and i think the reason is 
a fiveletter word cable said harry thomason executive 
producer of designing women 
sexually explicit language and situations on network television 
have produced occasional complaints but audiences are apparently 
rather blase after being presented a variety of rrated cable fare 
not to mention videocassettes ac nielsen co estimates that 622 
percent of us homes with televisions also have a vcr 
the networks faced with remotecontrol grazing cable 
options and videocassettes are having to loosen up or lose viewers 
nbc the no 1 network broadcast favorite son a political 
potboiler spiced up with scenes of sexual bondage 
in an episode of abcs thirtysomething a wife crawled around 
on the floor in search of a fumbled diaphragm 
last season saturday night live executive producer lorne 
michaels complained about his battle with network censors over a 
sketch whose purpose was to see how often actors could say the word 
for the male sex organ on network tv this season the sketch got on 
the air 
the average family in a major urban center can have access to 
30plus different television signals not to mention home video 
where they can see explicit language full nudity and simulated 
sex in far more graphic and strong ways than youve ever seen on 
network television says alan gerson nbc vice president for 
program marketing and administration 
he says networks are loosening standards but carefully keeping 
back from the cutting edge of change 
were not changing first gerson said 
do viewers mind 
i get a lot of discussion on it but really when you sit down 
and look at it and hear whats said i dont really hear anybody 
complaining said art chapman of the fort worth startelegram 
president of the television critics association 
the fact is he said whether you like it or not it does 
produce ratings which means that people are watching it 
there are three groups of viewers out there said dorothy 
swanson head of virginiabased viewers for quality television 
theres your group that would really like to see more explicit 
material they enjoy that its interesting and its entertaining 
and its fun 
then theres another group that are your prudes who really feel 
that there shouldnt be a single dirty word no openmouthed 
kissing no bedroom scenes those people are going to always object 
and they must be just screaming right about now 
and then theres the group that just accepts it and keeps their 
eye on it and turns the dial if they dont like it 
when the radio station broadcast carlins seven dirty words 
routine carlin was explaining that there are seven words not 
allowed to be broadcast a complaint to the federal communications 
commission prompted a lawsuit that led to the supreme court ruling 
the fcc does not get involved in network standards but investigates 
complaints against the stations that it licenses 
a complaint about a network show would have to meet the fccs 
definition of indecency before action would be taken indecency is 
described as patently offensive as measured by contemporary 
community standards for the broadcast medium 
for network censors community standards apply to a global 
village where a community can be a time period or a demographic 
group the changing expectations of television audiences have 
changed the stereotypical scissorwielding censor into something of 
ad hoc sociologist 
tv is a dynamic medium it has to stay in touch with society 
it has to grow as society grows and deal with subjects that are 
relevant to peoples lives said matthew margo cbs vice president 
for program practices 
i think the objective here is not to go too far its to be 
willing to grow to be willing to take prudent risks but never to 
do anything thats going to offend a significant portion of our 
viewing audience or advertisers or affiliates 
all three networks have cut back their standards and practices 
departments to save money but insist nothing has gotten on the air 
that would not have before 
the cutbacks have however increased the possibility of 
risk said alfred r schneider abc vice president for broadcast 
standards and practices because you dont have an overview and 
backup system that existed 
cbs and abc have eliminated one level of censors and put a bigger 
workload on supervisors nbc eliminated its standards and practices 
department completely reassigning most of its functions to the 
entertainment division which may be akin to the fox guarding the 
henhouse 
but nbc was no doubt chastened by its experience with geraldo 
riveras twohour special devil worship exposing satans 
underground 
though the sensationalistic special ranked no 5 in the nielsen 
ratings for the week nbc said it lost money because so many 
advertisers pulled out gerson says the show was actually a 
triumph for the remnants of the standards department in view of 
how much gruesome material was eliminated 
during a recent presentation to television critics meeting in los 
angeles nbc entertainment president brandon tartikoff was accosted 
by an actor dressed as a priest and forced to swear on a stack of 
bibles that he would not air another geraldo rivera special 
devil worship was attacked by television critics in part 
because of its early time period 8 pm est when presumably 
children could be watching in fact much of the shift in standards 
has taken place after 9 pm when networks assume mostly adults are 
watching 
an episode of nbcs 10 oclock program la law opened in the 
setting of a fertility clinic where a patient providing a sperm 
sample moaned loudly from behind a bathroom door it turned out he 
was having trouble getting the lid off the specimen jar in an 
episode of the 9 pm cheers on nbc sam the bartender was 
stranded behind a table because of his state of sexual excitement 
the standards really relate to the kind of program youre 
dealing in said schneider what may work in a 10 oclock 
program like thirtysomething would be totally inappropriate 
to an 8 oclock program 
one way standards departments have cut their workload is by 
paying less attention to such grated shows as murder she wrote 
but even designing women which often tackles sexual 
subjects has found the going easier of late said thomason whose 
wife linda bloodworththomason writes most of the scripts 
thomason said the show has had a good relationship with the 
censors but he nevertheless was surprised that the questionable 
breast word was approved the censor after seeing the script 
wanted to reserve judgment 
a lot of times if we disagree with them well say look why 
dont you let us shoot it and well shoot an alternative and see 
how its used and how it looks in the context of the show 
thomason said fortunately i dont remember a time when weve 
done that they didnt come back later and say ok we see what you 
were going for and its ok

six weeks after opec announced it would reduce

on the new york mercantile exchange wednesday the february 
contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us 
crude continued to climb picking up 45 cents to close at 1814 a 
barrel other contract months also rose 
analysts said a number of factors contributed to the days gains 
including a sharp drop in crude oil supplies and signs that opec is 
holding to its agreement to cut back production 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries agreed last 
november to reduce output by 3 million barrels to 185 million 
barrels a day wti prices have since climbed from the 15 range and 
analysts expect strong demand to push prices even higher 
the accord took effect jan 1 and continues for six months 
richard redoglia a broker with merrill lynch energy futures 
said higher prices have encouraged more people to come in and 
buy 
analysts said wednesdays crude market also got a boost from 
american petroleum institute statistics released tuesday showing oil

world crude prices have climbed by more than 3 a 
barrel in the six weeks since opec agreed to cut its production but 
analysts remain skeptical that the accord will last 
prices of middle east oil are still below opecs targeted price 
of 18 a barrel and some of the recent gains may still be lost if 
the excess oil produced by the cartel late last year reaches the 
market 
since nov 28 when the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries announced it would curtail production middle eastern 
crude oil has risen more than 3 a barrel from approximately 11 
to about 15 
west texas intermediate the us benchmark grade of crude oil 
has shot up to more than 18 a barrel from 1503 the day the accord 
was finalized 
most market observers had expected prices to rise but they had 
forecast a more gradual increase with the excess oil keeping prices 
soft for some time despite the recent increases experts remain 
doubtful about the future 
i dont see 18 in the year for opec basket prices at least 
not for any sustained period there is an overproduction that we 
will still see the consequences of down the road said john 
lichtblau president of the petroleum industry research foundation 
at the time of the opec agreement in november the 13member 
cartel was producing approximately 225 million barrels of oil a 
day in december that figure rose to about 23 million 
for january opecs production will be about 19 million barrels 
slightly above its new quota of 185 million opecs accord took 
effect jan 1 and extends for six months 
since it takes four to five weeks for most middle east oil to 
reach markets in the united states analysts believed shiploads of 
crude pumped late last year would be arriving on us shores any day 
now driving prices lower but they havent and the question many 
are asking is where is it 
i suppose some production could be in transit but we were 
hearing about surplus production as early as october and it hasnt 
shown up in the statistics said gordon pye an economist with 
irving trust co it calls into question the accuracy of the opec 
figures we read about either that or its being consumed more 
rapidly than anyone thinks 
nauman barakat vice president of energy investments for 
prudentialbache securities inc believes a lot of the excess oil 
is sitting in storage tanks somewhere in the middle east 
there was an intentional decision by the cartel to keep as much 
of that crude as possible off the market so as not to flood the 
market and force prices lower barakat said 
demand for opec oil in major oilconsuming countries like the 
united states and japan has been stronger than projected a report 
wednesday from the international energy agency showed industrialized 
countries consumed 384 million barrels a day of oil in the fourth 
quarter 1 million barrels or 4 percent more than previously 
forecast the report said us consumption was up 45 percent while 
japanese consumption rose 6 percent 
nevertheless many analysts believe high demand wont be enough 
to boost or sustain prices for middle east oil at the 18 level for 
the length of the agreement one opec country the united arab 
emirates has already acknowledged it is producing above its quota 
the question still is will opec stick to its quota beyond the 
first quarter said lichtblau

warner communications inc solidified its 
position as the leader in entertainment programming and beefed up 
its role in television by completing its 12 billion merger with 
lorimar telepictures corp 
the merger which involves a stock swap valued at about 635 
million and warners assumption of about 600 million in lorimar 
debt was concluded wednesday the two entertainment concerns said 
the companies had agreed to a merger last may but the completion 
of the deal was delayed because of legal complications arising from 
lorimars ownership of several television stations 
lorimar subsequently disposed of its television stations 
completing the sale of the last of them wpgh in pittsburgh on 
tuesday 
in trading on the new york stock exchange warner rose 37 cents 
a share to close at 3750 
under terms of the merger agreement warner said lorimar has 
become a whollyowned subsidiary of warner and each share of lorimar 
stock has been converted into the right to receive 3675 of a share 
on warner stock 
with about 46 million shares of common stock outstanding the 
lorimar stock could be converted into about 17 million shares of 
warner stock worth about 635 million at current prices 
in addition warner would assume lorimars debt of about 600 
million boosting the value of the transaction to about 12 billion 
warner also reaffirmed its plans to elect merv adelson chairman 
and chief executive of lorimar as vice chairman and a member of 
warners board the election will probably come at the next warner 
board meeting in february 
lorimar based in culver city calif is a leading producer and 
distributor of television programming 
a spokeswoman for lorimar barbara brogliatti said lorimar 
currently supplies nine shows and seven hours a week of programming 
carried on the major television networks including dallas 
knots landing and alf 
she said it supplies an additional 13 shows and 25 hours a week 
of firstrun syndicated programming to local stations including 
peoples court love connection and freddys nightmares 
warner currently has six shows on network television including 
night court and growing pains and spokesman geoffrey holmes 
said the combined total of 15 network shows outdistances production 
by any other studio 
holmes said warner already was the leader in entertainment 
programming which he defined as movies television shows and 
recorded music and publishing 
he said the merger will boost its revenue from such programming 
by 600 million a year to 4 billion or about 1 billion more than 
the second biggest entertainment programmer walt disney co 
lorimar has lost more than 380 million in the last 2 years but 
warner executives have said they expect lorimars performance will 
improve as some of its more popular firstrun shows are sold in 
syndication 
warner based in new york is a leading producer and distributor 
of movies television shows and recorded music and has interests in 
cable operations 
for the first nine months of 1988 warner earned 322 million or 
202 a share on revenue of 301 billion 
the stumbling block that had held up completion of the merger 
stemmed from a 1984 agreement that warner and its biggest 
stockholder chriscraft industries inc reached when they bought 
stakes in one another 
as chriscraft bought its stake in warner warner bought a 425 
percent interest in chriscrafts bhc inc broadcasting unit 
chriscraft sued to block the lorimar deal last summer saying 
the 1984 agreement prohibited warner from owning television stations 
as long as it owned 25 percent or more of bhc 
a state court judge in new york blocked the planned merger in 
late september lorimar subsequently agreed to sell its television 
stations completing the sale of its interest in two stations in 
puerto rico in late december and the sale of the pittsburgh station 
late tuesday

household international incs exit 
from the manufacturing arena is a boon to the firms shareholders 
who will receive stock in three new companies free of charge while 
retaining their shares in the streamlined company 
household international said wednesday it was dissolving its 1 
billion manufacturing group ending four years of restructuring 
efforts and would concentrate solely on financial services 
the company said it would spin off three manufacturing units to 
shareholders and sell six other businesses including thermos co 
its a pleasant surprise to see a company doing something 
right said rudolph martin an analyst who follows household for 
dean witter reynolds inc 
martin called households announcement an illustration of their 
integrity 
they realize they can increase shareholder value by spinning 
off these operations he said 
analysts said the value of households stock may decline 
slightly but the value of shareholders new stock should more than 
make up the difference 
the three independent companies to be created are eljer 
industries inc a building products company with anticipated 1988 
sales of more than 400 million schwitzer inc a maker of engine 
parts with anticipated 1988 sales of 140 million and scotsman 
industries inc a manufacturer of commercial refrigeration products 
with anticipated 1988 sales of 175 million 
the firm will be left with four financialservices operations 
household finance corp the household bank household commercial 
finance and the alexander hamilton life insurance co 
households stock price surged 525 wednesday on the new york 
stock exchange in reaction to the announcement closing at 6237 
martin estimated the combined potential value of the surviving 
company and the three spinoffs at 72 a share 58 for households 
financialservices operations and 14 for the spinoffs 
household said it was considering a taxfree distribution of one 
new share in each of the three spinoffs for every five shares of 
households common stock on or about april 15 
household said it would use the proceeds from the transactions to 
reduce its 500 million debt by about 255 million and pump about 
95 million into its financial services businesses 
the actions represent a logical next step to several years of 
restructuring in a continuing effort to maximize shareholder 
value chairman donald c clark said in a statement 
the units to be sold are thermos the wellknown maker of 
insulated products for storing and serving food gcthorsen a 
marketer of entertainment accessories and hand tools albion 
industries a leading manufacturer of heavy duty casters 
kingsealey a major supplier of cookingappliance controls omni 
products international a furniture maker and watertest corp a 
provider of watertesting services for consumer and commercial 
markets 
household which is based in prospect heights northwest of 
chicago said it expected to receive well in excess of 120 
million for the six units 
analysts said households departure from manufacturing was not 
surprising considering the companys sale of its household 
merchandising subsidiary in 1985 and of national car rental a year 
later 
frederick wightman vice president of research with duff amp phelps 
inc in chicago said investors perceived manufacturing as having a 
cyclical influence on households stock price he said the 
company may be able to attract more investors by focusing on 
financial services which are considered to be more stable 
household said it expected 1988 sales from its manufacturing 
division to exceed 1 billion 
the company reported overall 1987 profit of 2215 million on 
sales of 34 billion 
household said it could not provide an overall figure for 1988 
sales and profits but that it expected a 20 percent increase in 
pershare earnings for the year

us airlines have three days to check for 
crosswiring in 300 boeing 737s following speculation that faulty 
warnings deceived the pilot of a british 737 into shutting down his 
only good engine when the other one caught fire 
we think this is not a very likely scenario but its a check 
that can be done very very quickly without disrupting service 
said federal aviation administration spokesman john leyden 
the faa order late wednesday applies to eight piedmont airlines 
737400s with usfrench cfm56 engines similar to the british 
midland airways 737 that crashed sunday in england killing 44 
people it also would cover 292 smaller boeing 737300s operated by 
10 us airlines 
no planes were grounded by the order and other 737s and other 
planes using the cfm56 engines would not be affected 
faa administrator allan mcartor issued the order after the 
british civil aviation authority ordered similar checks for three 
types of aircraft flown by british carriers including the same two 
models of the 737 and the airbus a320 
the british agency also ordered increased inspections of cfm56 
engines on the planes a step the faa was still considering said a 
spokesman 
the faas air worthiness directive gives airlines 72 hours 
from official receipt of the warnings this morning to make the 
inspections which officials said would take about an hour for each 
plane 
this could allow each plane to make one or two flights before the 
inspection was mandatory and officials said it should not disrupt 
airline schedules 
we certainly believe its a prudent measure to go out and check 
to make sure theres nothing wrong with the fleet boeing 
commercial airplanes spokesman craig martin said wednesday in 
seattle but certainly this precautionary measure does not imply 
there has been any cause identified for the crash 
martin said he was not aware of any previous incorrect wiring 
problems in 737s he said there was one instance of improper 
instruments connections on a 747 jumbo jet but the airline 
discovered the problem and repaired it without any mishap 
as a precaution boeing also is checking its procedures for 
testing 737 wiring martin said just to verify theyre doing what 
we expect them to be doing 
british officials said wednesday it was too early to conclude 
what caused the crash and they were still examining the possibility 
that both engines failed a statement from the british transport 
department said however that the airliners left engine caught 
fire and the right engine was shut down and that pilot kevin hunt 
had told ground control the fire was in the right engine 
this led to the speculation that crossed wires might have caused 
warning lights to mislead hunt into shutting down the right instead 
of the left engine he could not see the engines from the cockpit 
hunt who was injured in the crash was interviewed by investigators 
wednesday but they did not disclose what he told them 
fred farrar another faa spokesman said airlines flying the 
737300s are aloha america west american continental delta 
orion piedmont southwest united and us air piedmont is the 
only airlines using 737400s with the cfm56 engines 
the us inspections will cover fire warning systems and 
vibration monitoring circuitry in the aircraft farrar said 
he said there have been very very isolated incidents of 
crosswiring of warning systems in us aircraft but none has led to 
an accident 
john mazor spokesman for the air line pilots association said 
he could not recall a specific incident of crosswiring but added 
it is not unheard of for brand new aircraft to come off the 
assembly line with wires crossed or systems improperly configured

the troubled smallappliance maker allegheny 
international inc said today it asked the federal bankruptcy court 
to void a previously announced buyout plan by former ally donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette 
the company which has been operating under chapter 11 federal 
bankruptcy protection for nearly a year advised the court that 
instead it will submit its own reorganization plan 
allegheny internationals board of directors voted to take such 
action late wednesday citing the securities firms deal with other 
investors to carve up the consumer products company 
the boards move though angered many of its creditors who had 
backed the donaldson lufkin plan 
were amazed and disappointed that the board having postponed 
a decision from november to december and then from december to 
january has now rejected the sale route altogether said wilbur 
ross of rothschild inc adviser to a committee of unsecured 
creditors 
peter a joseph a partner in the paul s levy merchant banking 
group in new york which would have participated in the donaldson 
lufkin takeover plan also expressed disappointment 
we were surprised were disappointed and were examining our 
options he said 
in a privately negotiated deal the total value of which has not 
been disclosed the levy group would have bought allegheny 
internationals profitable lawn furniture and gas grill business for 
about 250 million according to published reports 
the two groups were once competing bidders 
the new york times reported today that besides being taken back 
by the new alignment allegheny international directors were upset 
by a decision by donaldson lufkin to put 30 million less common 
equity into the deal than it had earlier proposed 
the board had announced a tentative merger agreement with 
donaldson lufkin at the end of last year

fbi and pentagon investigators are reviewing 
admissions by general electric that test records may have been 
falsified at a factory that made parts for military and commercial 
aircraft according to court documents and federal officials 
the investigation centers on a check and drain valve for the f404 
engine that powers the navys fa18 fighter ge spokesman richard 
kennedy said wednesday 
the ge factory in question also makes an engine part used by the 
type of boeing aircraft that crashed sunday in britain killing 44 
people but federal and company officials said the part could not 
have caused the accident the federal investigation began last year 
and has no connection with the accident in england 
ge spokesman richard kennedy said wednesday that the factory made 
a timer valve for the cfm56 engine used by the boeing 737400 as 
well as a check and drain valve for the f404 engine aboard the 
navys fa18 fighter 
another ge employee attorney robert c anderson said in a 
letter last year that test records may have been falsified for 
valves used on the fa18 in 198487 
according to newly revealed court papers in cincinnati the fbi 
has become involved in the investigation 
british investigators looking into the crash of the 737400 said 
the airplanes left engine caught fire and the right engine was shut 
down the cfm56 engine for the 737400 is made jointly by general 
electric co and a french company snecma 
the timer valve manufactured by ge for the cfm56 engine on the 
737 could not have caused the turbine to fail or threatened flight 
safety even if the valve malfunctioned kennedy said in telephone 
interview from his office in cincinnati where ges aircraft engine 
operations are based 
faa spokesman fred farrar said tuesday the timer assembly could 
not have caused the british midland crash he said its failure would 
only cause a small increase in engine temperature but not a fire 
navy spokeswoman lt nettie johnson was unable to say immediately 
whether the aircraft had experienced problems from faulty check and 
drain valves 
anderson the ge attorney said in a letter dated june 2 1988 
that in late may 1988 it was discovered that prior to july 1987 
a particular flow leak check which is required by geae general 
electric aircraft engine specifications was not performed on the 
f404 check and drain valves 
it is believed that the test was discontinued sometime in 1983 
possibly as a result of the test fixture becoming broken anderson 
said the letter obtained by the associated press 
the test was reinstituted in july 1987 when the problem was 
detected by lower level personnel in the plant the letter said 
during the period involved it is also believed that operators 
may have falsified internal test records which are maintained to 
reflect actual test readings anderson said in the letter 
andersons letter does not indicate the total number of engines 
or their value but said that the deliveries covered the periods of 
aprilmay 1984 aprilmay 1985 aprilmay 1986 and aprilmay 1987 
defense department officials said they had received andersons 
letter as part of what they called a voluntary disclosure 
program for companies that believe they have not met the terms of 
their contracts 
the inspector generals office in the pentagon in conjunction 
with the fbi is investigating the admissions in the letter said 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
james helmer an attorney representing the former manager of the 
ge plant said his client had been questioned in connection with the 
investigation last oct 14 by two fbi agents and a representative of 
the air force 
helmers client anthony l divencenzo filed suit against 
general electric last year on behalf of the government seeking to 
recover damages for more than 2000 f404 engines that helmer said 
were delivered without inspection 
at the request of the justice department all documents in the 
divencenzo suit remained under seal until last friday when us 
district court judge carl rubin denied a federal motion to allow the 
justice department until feb 1 to decide whether to join the case 
as a plaintiff 
the motion cited the factual complexities of the case

farley inc today extended its 14 billion 
unsolicited offer for textile giant west pointpepperell inc for 
the seventh time moving the deadline back another week 
pepperell is fighting the 48pershare offer first made oct 
25 with various takeover defenses several of which have been 
struck down by a federal judge 
the deadline which was wednesday at midnight was extended 
exactly a week to this coming wednesday at midnight 
on wednesday pepperell attorneys were at the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals asking judges there to reinstate poison pill 
provisions that had been thrown out by a lower court 
in addition farley representatives were negotiating wednesday 
with the georgia secretary of states office to answer concerns 
raised about the deals financing 
also a federal judge received a written report from a 
courtappointed expert on farleys challenge of georgias 
antitakeover law 
the poison pill ruled illegal in november by us district 
judge g ernest tidwell would become effective after a shareholder 
had acquired 10 percent of the outstanding stock under its 
provisions all but the large shareholder could then purchase more 
stock at a deep discount 
farley manufacturer of fruit of the loom underwear and acme 
boots owns 98 percent or 29 million shares of pepperell stock 
today the company said approximately 14 million shares had been 
tendered which would give the chicagobased conglomerate control of 
about 57 percent of pepperell shares well short of the twothirds 
requirement on which the offer is contingent 
pepperell told the appeals court that tidwell was incorrect when 
he ruled that pepperell had no legal standing to question the amount 
of debt contained in farleys offer and that farleys financial 
adviser drexel burnham lambert inc was not bound by an agreement 
barring disclosure of confidential information obtained during 
pepperells acquisition of jp stevens amp co inc last year 
farley attorney stephen greiner contended during wednesdays 
90minute hearing that the pill is a device by which the board of 
directors of west point says nobody can buy more than 10 percent 
drexel attorney lawrence silverman said the investment firm was 
not bound by the standstill agreement between odyssey partners 
which drexel advised and jp stevens pepperell became the 
nations largest publicly held textile company through a joint deal 
with odyssey partners to acquire stevens 
in any case silverman said drexel had divulged no confidential 
information to farley 
the judges gave no indication of when they would rule 
outside the courtroom farleys greiner said he did not know what 
negotiations were going on between farley and cleland who last 
friday ordered the company to provide assurance that the 
shareholders of west point will be fully informed as to the risks 
associated with both accepting and rejecting the farley tender 
offer 
meanwhile a courtappointed expert had turned in his findings to 
tidwell who still must rule on farleys claims that georgias 
antitakeover law which severely restricts mergers after takeovers 
is unconstitutional 
tidwells ruling is expected later this week 
pepperell based in west point ga manufactures martex towels 
and arrow shirts and has about a quarter of the nations home 
fashion textile market 
on wednesday the company also announced that its earnings for 
its first fiscal quarter ended dec 24 fell 457 percent to 108 
million or 37 cents a share from 199 million or 64 cents a 
share a year ago 
the drop was blamed on 17 million in special charges including 
3 million incurred in fighting farley 
its firstquarter revenue rose 42 percent to 6831 million from 
481 million a year earlier the latest figures included sales from 
stevens

the chicago board of trade has fined and suspended 
six men linked to a scheme in which a trader donned a wig and used 
fake identification to access privileged information cbot officials 
said today 
the six cbot members were fined between 5000 and 50000 each 
and suspended for periods ranging from 15 days to 10 years 
the cbots disciplinary bodies found all six engaged in what they 
called fraud and dishonorable and dishonest conduct and 
reckless and unbusinesslike dealings inconsistent with just and 
equitable principles of trade 
none of the six could be reached today for comment 
the traders were linked through federal court testimony last 
summer to the wig scheme masterminded by veteran trader thompson b 
sanders sanders was sentenced last november to six years in prison 
the disciplinary moves by the board imposed dec 16 but 
announced this week followed revelations by prosecutors in the 
sanders probe 
sanders 45 was found guilty of engineering the scheme in which 
daniel dewey another former cbot trader donned a wig and used 
stolen trader badges and jackets to gain access to a restricted area 
in proximity to the treasury bond trading pit 
the government claimed that because of the disguises sanders 
dewey and others in the scheme were able to claim 30000 in trading 
profits without detection dewey was sentenced to five years in 
prison 
the six suspended traders were identified as david schremser dan 
hayes patrick bratta scott bremner patrick sutor and robert 
kinkade schremser and hayes testified under grants of immunity from 
prosecution at sanders trial the cbot said 
the cbot board of governors imposed a 10year suspension on 
bremner fined him 50000 and barred him from associating with 
other members of the exchange during the suspension 
bretta was suspended for four years and fined 25000 hayes was 
suspended for two years sutor was suspended for six months and 
fined 10000 
kinkade was suspended for four months and fined 10000 and 
schremser was suspended for 15 days and fined 5000 
us attorney anton valukas said the investigation into corrupt 
trading practices is still continuing

the chief of mexicos powerful oil workers 
union was arraigned today on charges of illegal weapons possession 
homicide gun smuggling and resisting arrest 
the arrest tuesday of joaquin hernandez galicia prompted strikes 
by union members that crippled the countrys nationalized oil 
industry for a day but ended wednesday at a behest of a union 
official 
hernandez galicia was charged today before penal judge jose luis 
garcia vasco who has 72 hours to decide whether the accused should 
be released on bail 
on wednesday night hernanadez galicia claimed the 200 uzi 
machine guns seized in an assault on his home were smuggled from the 
united states and needed by union leaders for selfdefense 
officials said 
at least 50 associates of the union boss arrested with him 
tuesday face charges of fraud weapons and tax evasion said 
fernando arias perez a spokesman for the attorney generals office 
a source in the office who spoke on condition of anonymity also 
said that two of hernandez galicias bodyguards on wednesday accused 
their boss of ordering the 1983 slaying of a mayor who headed a 
union local 
tensions have long run high between hernandez galicia and newly 
inaugurated president carlos salinas de gortari who has pledged to 
sell or close unprofitable or nonstrategic state industries 
hernandez galicias allegedly corrupt mexican oil workers union 
controls more than half the lucrative drilling contracts issued by 
the state oil monopoly pemex 
pemex director francisco rojas told a news conference wednesday 
that the production of crude oil gasoline and petrochemicals had 
returned to normal 
we are fulfilling all our exportation commitments to other 
countries he said mexico is the worlds sixthlargest crude oil 
producer and production from the countrys nine refineries amounts 
to 14 million barrels a day 
victor de leon acting coordinator of the union said the 
backtowork appeal had come from salvador barragan camacho the 
unions secretarygeneral until wednesday 
the government news agency notimex reported later that leaders of 
the unions locals had designated ricardo camero cardiel a local 
leader and senator from the northeastern city of ciudad madero the 
unions new secretarygeneral weapons were found at barragan 
camachos home and he was under arrest officials said 
hernandez galicia told investigators the uzis and about 30000 
cartridges were secretly delivered to him on dec 10 by former 
reynosa mayor jose cruz contreras the attorney generals office 
said in a statement 
hernandez galicia said the arms were to defend his union 
members given the existing situation in the country the 
statement said 
the government has not said what it thinks hernandez galicia 
planned to do with the weapons 
last week the union chief threatened to paralyze the oil 
industry if the government carried out a threat to sell pemex 
operations to private investors 
hernandez galicia was arrested when soldiers blew down his door 
with a bazooka in a raid on his ciudad madero home a federal agent 
was shot to death in the attack 
a spokesman for the attorney generals office felipe flores 
said a paraffin test performed on hernandez galicia showed he had 
fired a gun flores did not elaborate 
in his statement to investigators hernandez galicia argued that 
security forces had no right to force their way into his home 
he said he had planned to distribute some of the uzis to other 
oil union leaders and said cruz contreras whom he described as a 
good friend did not charge him for the weapons and ammunition 
the attorney generals office said it did not say where in the 
united states the arms were bought

major commercial banks say they should receive 
loan guarantees from governments or agencies like the world bank 
before they lend out any more money to debtridden third world 
countries 
creditor countries risk that some of these debtor countries 
will default on their debt explained horst schulmann the west 
german managing director of the institute of international finance 
if this happens the banks of the creditor countries will 
suffer heavy losses 
the institute which represents 186 leading banks and other 
private lenders around the world issued a position paper on 
wednesday apparently aimed at influencing the bush administrations 
views on third world debt 
the paper said there is a case for creditor governments and 
the international financial institutions to provide assistance 
possibly through guarantees of principal and interest 
former treasury secretary james a baker iii the choice of 
presidentelect bush to become secretary of state has strongly 
opposed official guarantees because they transfer to taxpayers the 
risks taken by private lenders 
the world bank which is owned by 151 governments estimates that 
third world countries now owe 13 trillion more than 540 billion 
of it to private lenders

chemical banking corp one of the nations largest banking 
companies on thursday reported a 26 percent jump in its 
fourthquarter profit and record earnings for 1988 
the company attributed those gains partly to a decrease in its 
provision for future loan losses from third world countries and 
pastdue interest payments from brazil 
net income for the three months ended dec 31 totaled 2885 
million or 466 a share up from 2296 million or 383 a share 
the same time a year earlier 
the 1987 quarterly earnings included a 1264 million pretax 
gain on a pension settlement and 256 million from the sale of 
chemicals factoring business 
for the year chemicals profit totaled a record 7536 million 
or 1202 a share compared with a yearearlier loss of 8537 
million 
the 1988 figures included pretax gains of 538 million on the 
settlement of a portion of its pension obligations and 413 million 
on the sale or closure of nonstrategic businesses and the receipt 
of about 161 million in pastdue interest from brazil from feb 20 
1987 to sept 30 1988 
the 1987 earnings reflected the companys decision to add nearly 
15 billion to its loanloss provision at the peak of the third 
world debt crisis during that year brazil had placed a moratorium 
on interest payments to commercial banks 
in 1988 chemical added around 364 million to its loanloss 
provision including 81 million in the final quarter the 1987 
fourthquarter provision was 108 million 
chemical said fourthquarter operating earnings reflected 
increases in corporate finance fees earnings from equity affiliates 
and declines in noninterest expense as well as the smaller 
loanloss provision 
it said a drop in net interest income bond trading and 
foreignexchange profits helped partially offset those gains 
the huge profit for 1988 was largely attributed to an increase in 
net interest income corporate finance fees profits from bond 
trading and the lower loanloss provision 
the 1988 results also included fullyear earnings from texas 
commerce bancshares inc which merged with chemical in may 1987 
texas commerce earned 21 million last year compared with a 1203 
million loss in 1987 chemical said

the maker of minox miniature 
cameras the spy cameras made famous in an early james bond 
movie has racked up big losses sought bankruptcycourt protection 
and cut its workforce by 50 percent in a struggle to stay in the 
japanesedominated market 
minoxs woes are just part of the restructuring of west germanys 
proud camera industry which has seen the only other two allgerman 
companies leica and rollei drop out of the amateur automatic focus 
camera market to concentrate on producing highpriced professional 
gear 
minox which continues to pursue the amateur photographer market 
in tough competition with japans producers is based in the central 
west german town of heuchelheim near giessen about 40 miles north 
of frankfurt 
the socalled spy camera used in the 1963 james bond movie 
from russia with love can be concealed in the palm or easily 
slipped into a normal pocket a newer version the minox ec is even 
smaller about as long and thick as a normal index finger and not 
more that twofingers wide 
ludwig rinn who died in 1942 invented the tiny camera in 1938 
in riga latvia in what is now the soviet union his descendants 
founded the minox company in heuchelheim on jan 3 1949 
exactly 40 years later minox filed for bankruptcycourt 
protection and a courtappointed executive entrusted with running 
the company cut 220 of its 564 employees the reduction followed a 
cut of 186 employees last april 
this is really hurting heuchelheim the towns mayor willi 
marx told the associated press in an interview at his office earlier 
this month 
not only the jobs but also the taxes we may have to reduce 
some town services the mayor said the town has a population of 
7500 
loss of the jobs also means small businesses in heuchelheim will 
lose the customers who used to go shopping there after work marx 
said 
but i guess the worst part is the months of uncertainty that 
the families have gone through for the past months some have spent 
their whole lives at minox others had grandfathers and fathers who 
also worked there he said 
minox has not shown a profit since 1981 and on april 1 1988 
robert c corduwener a netherlands businessman bought a 51 percent 
share of the company to take control from the rinn family 
corduwener immediately cut the workforce to streamline the

because of improper phone service charges 
uncovered in a secret puc probe pacific bell has paid out 945 
million in penalties and refunds to 491000 customers the utility 
says 
company officials said tuesday 63 million in charges billed to 
customers for services they did not order or need were refunded 
between september 1986 and november 1988 
the utility spent another 15 million to notify 85 million 
customers about the refunds and yet another 165 million in 
penalties levied by the public utilities commission 
the puc reported that an undercover staff investigation disclosed 
that pacific bell representatives among other things often added 
optional features such as callwaiting and callforwarding to bills 
although they hadnt been ordered 
the phone company said it will continue to offer the refunds to 
customers who received unwanted services between january 1985 and 
october 1986

the british government on thursday temporarily 
barred general electric co plc and siemens ag from proceeding with 
their hostile 36 billion takeover bid for british defense 
contractor plessey co 
trade secretary lord young said he referred the bid to the 
monopolies and mergers commission to determine its effects on 
competition particularly in defense electronics and air traffic 
control equipment 
young asked the commission to make its recommendation within 
three months during that time the bidders cannot proceed with their 
offer and are limited to a plessey holding of under 15 percent 
following the ruling the british and german partners raised 
their stake in plessey to about 149 percent from about 3 percent 
meanwhile in brussels belgium the european commission said it 
would investigate the joint bid which might break common market 
competition rules 
the commission was requesting information from the companies 
involved and hoped to complete the inquiry as soon as possible 
said a spokesman for leon brittan a briton who is the new european 
commissioner for competition policy 
the developments came amid expectations that a newly formed 
international consortium expected to include plessey would make a 
bid for gec a british electronics giant that is unrelated to the 
similarly named us company 
the potential bid for gec was expected to be worth between 116 
billion and 143 billion which would make it the largest takeover 
ever on londons stock exchange 
such a counterbid would be what wall street calls a pac man 
defense because of its similarity to the eatorbeeaten video game 
after the british governments announcement gec and siemens paid 
439 a share in a midmorning raid that increased their joint stake 
in gec to the maximum allowed said barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
broker to the companies 
by paying 439 a share for plessey stock the bidders are forced 
by british takeover rules to raise their offer to at least that 
price if they get clearance to proceed 
a bid at that price would value the whole of plessey at about 
33 billion 
the previous offer of 403 a share which automatically lapsed 
valued plessey at 3 billion 
gec and siemens a west german electronics maker said they would 
cooperate with the british inquiry in the belief that the proposed 
merger will be allowed to proceed in due course 
plessey shares finished 13 cents higher at 417 on londons 
stock exchange gec shares ended up 4 cents at 385 
the gecsiemens bid has come under heavy political pressure in 
britain and a referral to the mergers commission had been considered 
likely the government blocked a solo bid from gec for plessey in 
1986 saying it would harm competition in the british defense 
electronics market 
but many analysts expect the government to allow it to proceed 
this time 
plessey meanwhile said it would not relax its attempts to fight 
the gecsiemens bid 
john clark plesseys chairman and chief executive officer said 
his company would explore various means to maximize shareholder 
benefits the statement was believed to be a reference to plesseys 
expected role in the efforts to build a consortium bid for gec 
metsun ltd a shell company set up to lead any bid for gec said 
talks on a possible offer were continuing the offer would lead to 
the breakup of gec and the sale some of its businesses 
analysts said the investigations could hinder the negotiations 
which are being conducted by plesseys adviser lazard brothers and 
co because the referral indicated that any further bid in the 
industry also would be referred to the commission

a federal appeals court rejected defense 
arguments thursday to prevent a second trial in the 
stockmanipulation case against gaf corp and a key company officer 
two days after a mistrial was declared 
the ruling by the 2nd circuit court of appeals after a brief 
hearing means jury selection for a new trial will commence next 
tuesday in us district judge mary johnson lowes court lawyers 
involved in the case said 
lowe decreed a mistrial tuesday in the first major case arising 
from the wall street insider trading scandal to reach the trial 
phase she based the ruling on a prosecutorial blunder in handling a 
key piece of evidence 
the judge ordered a new trial but lawyers for the chemical 
company and vice chairman james sherwin appealed on grounds of 
double jeopardy the legal principle that protects defendants from 
two trials for the same offense 
defense lawyers routinely object to new trials when mistrials are 
declared but the strategys success depends on the circumstances of 
the case 
in instances of prosecutorial misconduct the defense generally 
has to prove that prosecutors deliberately provoked a mistrial 
because they feared they would lose and wanted a second chance 
but judge lowe said she believed the prosecutions mistake in the 
gaf case was unintentional which weighed heavily in the appeals 
courts support of her decision to proceed with a new trial 
gaf and sherwin were indicted in july for an alleged scheme to 
manipulate up the price of union carbide corp stock in order to 
maximize gafs gain from the sale of carbide shares it wished to 
sell after a failed takeover attempt 
the prosecution has based its case largely on the testimony of 
exbroker boyd l jefferies whose los angelesbased securities firm 
conducted the alleged manipulation on gafs behalf jefferies 
himself was implicated in wrongdoing by inside trader ivan f 
boesky who is now imprisoned

fried chicken king al copeland may resume his 
290 million takeover attempt against churchs fried chicken a 
federal appeals court ruled thursday 
im delighted said peter butler attorney for a copeland 
enterprises inc the company which owns new orleansbased popeyes 
famous fried chicken after judge henry a politz announced the 
decision for the threejudge 5th us circuit court of appeals panel 
the stay is lifted said butler well move forward with 
all haste and leave it to the shareholders as to whether or not to 
believe our offer is a reasonable one 
a hearing is set wednesday in federal court in san antonio 
texas where popeyes is fighting poison pill antitakeover 
bylaws which churchs adopted nov 4 more than a week after popeyes 
made its offer churchs is headquartered in san antonio 
i dont consider that a major obstacle said butler 
the judges announced their decision 35 minutes after arguments 
were over they did not go into their reasons for upholding the 
ruling handed down nov 28 by us district judge charles schwartz 
saying only that they affirmed it on all points 
we neither approve nor disapprove of the reasons for that 
decision politz said 
guy m struve the new york attorney representing churchs said 
he was disappointed and did not know when the chain would decide 
whether to appeal thursdays ruling 
struve argued that the 8ashare takeover bid should be halted 
because it was based on insider information provided by a former 
churchs executive now employed by popeyes and because merging the 
nations no 2 and 3 fried chicken chains would violate federal 
antitrust laws 
sam kadet of the corporate law firm of skadden arps said popeyes 
could give churchs notice on thursday that it planned to proceed 
with the takeover attempt and deliver the information to churchs 
after five business days popeyes would have 12 more business days 
after that to close the deal he said 
the chain has said that it owns 32 percent of churchs stock and 
has been tendered another 146 million about 406 percent of the 
359 million shares outstanding

allegheny international inc announced plans 
thursday to cancel a merger agreement with a new york securities 
firm in favor of a deal to sell its core ostersunbeam division to 
black amp decker corp for 260 million 
the proposed sale is the centerpiece of an independent plan of 
reorganization that management intends to present in bankruptcy 
court where creditors had backed the proposal from the securities 
firm donaldson lufkin amp jenrette inc 
the company also said it entered a letter of intent with spear 
leeds amp kellog head of a shareholders committee that had 
previously battled management to finance managements plan 
the ostersunbeam division makes a range of small household 
appliances including shavers mixers and other kitchen appliances 
black amp decker based in towson md manufactures and sells 
power tools accessories household appliances and lawn care 
equipment 
under managements plan allegheny international would be left 
with businesses that include lawn furniture gas grills electric 
blankets scales and clocks among other things 
the consensus is they just abdicated unsecured creditors 
counsel robert sable said after the board confirmed published 
reports that it voted down the donaldson lufkin amp jenrette plan on 
wednesday 
its time the creditors take control of the case he said 
in voting to cancel its earlier tentative merger agreement with 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette the board cited the securities firms 
subsequent arrangement with a rival bidder the paul s levy 
merchant banker group to carve up the company between them 
allegheny international said it would ask us bankruptcy court 
for sanctions against donaldson lufkin amp jenrette and against the 
levy group 
in its latest version the donaldson lufkin amp jenrette plan 
would have sold allegheny internationals lawn furniture and gas 
grill business to the levy group for about 250 million according 
to the wall street journal 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette would have retained the 
ostersunbeam division 
in another late change donaldson lufkin amp jenrette would have 
put 30 million less common equity into the deal than it had earlier 
proposed according to the new york times 
allegheny international said thursday it had asked the bankruptcy 
court to void the agreement with donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
we were surprised were disappointed and were examining our 
options said peter a joseph a partner in the levy group 
were amazed and disappointed that the board having postponed 
a decision from november to december and then from december to 
january has now rejected the sale route altogether said wilbur 
ross of rothschild inc an adviser to the unsecured creditors 
the board announced a tentative merger agreement with donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette last november after the major creditor groups shot 
down an earlier reorganization plan from management and forced the 
board to offer the company for sale 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette and levy both made independent 
buyout proposals the board twice endorsed the securities firms 
offer only to withdraw support when levy sweetened its bid 
both plans would have repaid creditors nearly in full donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette would have given stockholders 40 percent of the 
reorganized company which would have closely resembled the current 
allegheny international 
the levy group would have given shareholders 49 percent equity in 
what was left after selling the ostersunbeam unit to reduce debt

at a time when many securities firms have 
suffered an earnings slump bear stearns cos inc announced the 
best quarterly earnings in its history thursday more than a 
125fold gain over the year earlier period 
bear stearns also said it would repurchase up to 48 percent of 
its stock in the next four weeks which analysts called a reflection 
of selfconfidence in an era largely colored by postcrash 
uncertainty 
the company said earnings for the second quarter ended dec 31 
increased to 633 million from 500000 in the comparable period of 
1987 pershare earnings totaled 73 cents vs none a year earlier 
because of special payments to preferred shareholders 
revenue for the quarter totaled 6246 million up 41 percent 
from the 442 million for the same period a year earlier 
for the six months ended dec 31 bear stearns reported earnings 
of 838 million or 94 cents a share up 206 percent from 274 
million or 26 cents a share a year earlier 
revenue for the sixmonth period totaled 11 billion up from 
9066 million for the same period a year earlier 
many wall street firms involved primarily in retail brokerage 
posted lackluster results last year reflecting a flight from stocks 
following the october 1987 crash however firms involved primarily 
in investment banking such as financing corporate takeovers fared 
better 
bear stearns said results for the latest quarter reflected strong 
performance in principal transaction business management of 
its own money and its investment banking activities 
the firm would not provide figures for the retail business one 
of bear stearns six areas of operation but analysts said it was 
doing poorly 
some of the decisions made in october 1987 not to retrench

seasonally adjusted 30687 billion from 30656 billion the 
previous week 
an even broader measure m3 increased 47 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 39050 billion from 39003 billion 
m2 grew 54 percent and m3 grew 63 percent in 1988 according to

last year contributed to a 100000ton drop in annual copper 
production

fifthlargest producers fell by 135000 metric tons last year due 
to mechanical and transportation difficulties he said

james d watkins picked thursday by

job an expertise in an area that has emerged as the departments 
biggest headache nuclear weapons 
watkins studied nuclear reactor engineering in 1958 at the oak 
ridge tenn national laboratory he was an instructor at naval 
nuclear power training centers in 1960 and four years later took 
command of the nuclearpowered submarine snook 
the oak ridge lab is one link in the energy departments 
nationwide network of reactors and other nuclear weapons facilities 
the aging complex has been crippled recently by a series of safety 
and environmental problems leaving the united states temporarily 
unable to produce tritium a radioactive gas that is vital to making 
nuclear warheads 
one of watkins main tasks if he is confirmed in the post by the 
senate would be to guide the departments mounting efforts to 
rebuild the nuclear arms plants and clean up the environmental 
damage caused by four decades of bombmaking 
for two years before becoming a nuclear sub commander watkins 
was an administrative assistant in the naval reactors division of 
the atomic energy commission the forerunner of the energy 
department according to a pentagon biography 
watkins 61 capped his 41year naval career with a fouryear 
stint as chief of naval operations the services top post in the 
rank of admiral he retired in 1986 
although some of his closest friends advised him against it 
watkins accepted president reagans request in october 1987 to head 
an aids study commission that had been rocked by internal disarray 
and widespread public ridicule 
under watkins leadership the aids panel produced a series of 
widely praised recommendations 
watkins is described by associates as a clearthinker who blends 
practical experience with political savvy 
people can anticipate that he is a studied person that is he 
will study the issues in great depth said capt brent baker who 
served with watkins in the mediterranean in 197879 hes a blend 
of nuclear submariner and a good judge of people 
watkins was born in alhambra calif near the los angeles 
harbor on march 7 1927 his mother louiseward watkins ran 
unsuccessfully in 1938 for the republican nomination to a senate 
seat one of the few women of her time to run for national office 
he later recalled that his mother would take him to nearby navy 
ports to watch the big ships come and go she sometimes arranged to 
get aboard the ships where they dined with officers and heard tales 
about life on the high seas 
inspired by those stories and his firsthand look at sailors 
watkins decided to seek a life in the navy he entered the naval 
academy at annapolis md in 1945 just as world war ii was drawing 
to a close he graduated in 1949 
afterward watkins served aboard destroyers and submarines 
earned a masters degree at the naval postgraduate school and then 
made one of the key decisions in his career specializing in the 
field of nuclear submarines he became a confidante of adm hyman 
rickover the father of the modern nuclear navy and the man who 
played a key role in the careers of dozens of navy leaders 
rising within the navys ranks watkins became commander of the 
pacific fleet based at honolulu in march 1982 reagan chose him as 
chief of naval operations 
watkins helped oversee the big naval buildup from 450 to nearly 
600 ships that was at the heart of the reagan administrations 
defense policy in the presidents first term 
watkins and his wife of 38 years sheila jo have raised six 
children

a congressional hearing convened to clean 
up the mess in the nations savings and loans was told thursday 
that more than 220 million in losses from insider fraud have been 
uncovered in thrifts in california nevada and arizona 
the disclosure was contained in a halfinchthick statement from 
james cirona president of the federal home loan bank of san 
francisco cirona whose jurisdiction includes the three states 
testified before the house banking finance and urban affairs 
committee 
cirona said that since august of 1987 his investigators had 
referred 5384 cases of possible fraud or abuse to the us 
attorneys office 
the statement given to the lawmakers said many of the cases 
involve rather small amounts obtained fraudulently by borrowers or 
depositors 
however we are particularly concerned by abuse by insiders 
which may often involve very large sums of money it said for 
this reason we have established a special system of priority 
referrals that involves insiders or amounts in excess of 100000 
we estimate that losses to 11th district institutions on these 
priority referrals as of september 23 1988 amounted to over 220 
million 
committee chairman henry gonzalez dtexas called for a full 
analysis of the crisis in the savings and loans industry in which 
government bailouts exceeded 38 billion in 1988 
estimates of the cost to rescue the remaining 350 or so involvent 
thrifts have ranged from 50 billion to 75 billion 
the hearing was needed to clean up the mess that is already out 
there said the congressman adding that more hearings would be 
held in other major cities 
with both banks and savings and loans failing in record 
numbers it is imperative that this committee fully understands how 
the problems have developed in the industry and the manner in which 
state and federal regulatory agencies have responded to the 
crisis he said 
the lawmakers need to talk to the people who deal with these 
problems on a daytoday basis he said for too long there has 
been an overdependence on the wisdom of washingtonbased bureaucrats 
far removed from the scene of battle 
the hearing was scheduled to continue friday

knightridder inc on thursday announced plans to 
sell two of its daily newspapers the starnews in pasadena 
calif and the posttribune in gary ind 
the company has owned the starnews since 1956 the posttribune 
was purchased in 1966 knightridder will be represented in the sale 
of the two newspapers by goldmansachs 
knightridder declined to reveal any asking price for the papers 
the decision to sell these two newspapers was not an easy 
one said james k batten knightridder president and chief 
executive officer both papers have excellent leadership teams and 
fine editors writers and executives throughout their organizations 
but it is important to our shareholders and the future of our 
organization that its individual components fit the overall 
strategic and growth needs of knightridder 
batten said an analysis of the companys holdings led management 
to conclude that knightridder would benefit from selling the two 
newspapers 
proceeds will be used to reduce the companys debt repurchase 
the companys stock or make strategic acquisitions batten said 
we will be most inclined to consider offers from american 
publishers who recognize the full value of these newspapers and 
whose track records suggest that they would take seriously the 
newspapers responsibility to readers advertisers and the 
communities to be served batten said 
also on thursday knightridder announced that it has named larry 
jinks publisher of the san jose mercury news succeeding william a 
ott who will be the newspapers chairman 
jinks had been senior vice president for news and operations the 
appointment is effective april 1 
last april knightridders board of directors authorized the 
repurchase of 5 million shares of the companys stock at its 
december meeting the board authorized the repurchase of an 
additional 5 million shares 
knightridder currently has 30 newspapers as well as business 
information services and cable television operations last october 
the company announced it intends to sell its eight television 
stations but has not yet concluded a sale

a foul smell permeates the warehouses 
where bundles of used plastic milk jugs and laundry detergent 
bottles are stacked to the ceiling 
but to eaglebrook plastics the odor is the sweet smell of 
success 
once the smelly containers are cleaned and ground up at the 
plant the used plastic or postconsumer plastic can be sold 
for about 40 cents a pound 
manufacturers of products as diverse as pipes flower pots and 
toys are eager to buy the recycled plastic the price for new 
plastic has tripled in the past year to about 60 cents a pound 
theres a ready source of supply too many communities running 
out of landfill space are eager to ship their bulky plastic garbage 
to the middletown plant called eaglebrook east a branch of 
eaglebrook plastics inc of chicago the plant pays 100 to 150 per 
ton of used plastic depending on how clean and sorted it is 
plastics manufacturers have reground their own factory waste 
preconsumer plastic for years only recently have they begun 
to consider containers discarded by consumers as a viable source of 
lowergrade plastic 
it sounds simple but finding an efficient and profitable process 
for recycling plastic has eluded the materials recovery field for 
years because impurities interfere in the reprocessing 
there is a great demand for recovered plastic but the material 
has to be clean said andrew stephens president of eaglebrook 
plastics community recycling centers had to rely on the consumer 
to wash the bottles thoroughly and strip off the paper labels 
thats a lot of work for a person and so about 98 percent of 
those used containers ended up in the landfill our process frees 
the consumer and the community recycling center from the labor 
needed to clean those containers stephens said 
the company developed what it affectionately calls mr clean 
a 200000 machine that scrubs labels and bits of food from the 
oncesmelly empties 
once they are clean the plastic containers are ground into a 
grainy substance and packaged for sale 
eaglebrook opened shop in chicago about five years ago with 
10000 and an answering machine it now has annual sales of 5 
million and 50 employees stephens said 
once the business took hold in the midwest eaglebrook officials 
decided the company needed an east coast location 
we chose middletown because were trying to access the new york 
city market but we wanted to be outside the highpriced metropolitan 
area said robert thompson eaglebrooks vice president 
eaglebrook east opened in middletown in april it expects to post 
25 million in sales for 1988 
the company said theres such a tremendous source of raw 
materials that the middletown operations 10 employees keep the 
plant running 24 hours a day seven days a week 
about 22 billion pounds of highdensity polyethylene plastic 
containers are produced each year in the united states the company 
said eaglebrook plastics says it will recover more than 3 million 
pounds of that 
the company takes plastic waste from just about anywhere 
eaglebrook east has contracts with a new york city recycler two 
counties in new jersey and dutchess county in new york it also 
occasionally receives shipments from maine 
the middletown plant also will clean preconsumer waste 
shipped to it by plastics manufacturers in fact only about 20 
percent of the first 250 tons of plastic the company received fell 
into the postconsumer category 
to promote recycling eaglebrook is creating a line of products 
that are manufactured from reprocessed plastic plastic from used 
milk jugs which is dyed shades of brown and rust is being formed 
into shapes that resemble wooden planks and sold for building decks 
eaglebrook is probably the largest of the proprietary 
recyclers said susan vadney a spokeswoman for the journal of the 
society of the plastics industry 
the trade journal lists about two columns of recyclers and all 
most likely have automated washing systems like mr clean she said 
but its likely that they eaglebrook have the best vadney 
said
