presidentelect george bush should make a top 
priority of slashing aid to farmers particularly those subsidies 
that reward farmers for high production the conservative heritage 
foundation think tank said 
the report said farmers are generally better off than commonly 
believed and should be forced to operate in a more competitive 
environment with fewer government handouts 
the bush administration should develop a farm policy that would 
help american farmers break out of a cycle of dependence on 
federal subsidies charles grizzle wrote in the heritage 
foundations forthcoming policy guidebook 
grizzle a former senior official in the agriculture department 
said the key to weaning farmers from government aid is to 
decouple subsidy programs from production requirements 
the idea of decoupling has been around for a while but has not 
taken hold on capitol hill as grizzle sees it government payments 
to farmers would be based on a flat rate and targeted to those most 
in need of help 
congress and the next administration will have no choice but to 
deal with the subsidy issue since the 1985 farm law will expire in 
1990 according to agriculture department finance officers farm 
subsidies rose to a record 258 billion in 1986 the first year of 
the new law from 177 billion in 1985 
despite the media portrayal of the typical farmer as 
hardpressed farm families have had higher incomes than the median 
american family in every year since 1980 grizzle said more 
important the net worth of farm families far exceeds that of the 
american family 
with few exceptions he said the farmers and rural bankers who 
went broke during the hard times of the early 1980s or who remain 
under financial stress today are those who borrowed and invested 
heavily in getrichquick speculative fever of the 1970s 
they bet on rapidly inflating land values and bet wrong 
grizzle said it is unfair to force the taxpayers to pick up the 
tab 
earlier this week outgoing budget director joseph r wright said 
in an interview that farm subsidies will be a principal place that 
president reagan will look for savings in his effort to avert tax 
and deficit increases 
bush vacationing in kennebunkport maine turned aside 
reporters questions about areas where he will seek budget cuts 
robert a denman director of international and public affairs of 
the national farmers union said he wasnt surprised by the heritage 
foundations blueprint because its the same thing theyre always 
talking about when it comes to farm policy 
if george bush is really thinking about running a kinder 
gentler administration i have an idea hell probably reject a lot 
thats in that report denman said in an interview now if he 
doesnt i think it could be just exactly like what happened to the 
last report by the foundation the congress will probably reject 
most of it 
but if lawmakers accept the heritage foundations view there 
would be a period of economic and social chaos for rural 
america he said 
grizzles chapter on agriculture is just part of the 953page 
volume mandate for leadership iii scheduled for publication on 
jan 2 the third in a series of policy guidebooks published by the 
foundation others were published after reagans election in 1980 
and again in 1984 
for more than half a century the principle of farm subsidies has 
been pegged to production the larger the farm the larger the 
payments 
planting decisions would then be based on market signals 
consumer demand for a product rather than on what is required by 
washington said grizzle a former deputy assistant secretary for 
administration at the agriculture department 
grizzle wrote also that the incoming administration should wean 
farmers from dependence on disaster aid by requiring them to take 
out federally guaranteed or entirely private crop insurance in order 
to qualify for federal subsidy programs or loans 
when natural disasters struck in the past including this years 
heat and drought farmers turned to the us treasury making 
taxpayers foot the bill grizzle said

former mayor jack reardon who underwent 
a heart transplant nearly two years ago died friday of heart 
failure he was 45 
reardon entered the university of kansas medical center 
complaining of dizziness and shortness of breath early friday and 
doctors implanted a pacemaker said mary harrison a hospital 
spokeswoman reardon died about 650 pm she said adding that 
doctors hope to learn more through tests about the underlying cause 
of death 
reardon was serving as mayor when he received a new heart on feb 
18 1987 at the medical center he had suffered from 
cardiomyopathy which results in inadequate pumping ability 
reardon a democrat served 12 years as mayor before losing the 
general election in april 1987 to joseph steineger reardon said he 
believed his health was a factor in his loss 
earlier this month reardon was elected to the wyandotte county 
commission after being unopposed in the general election 
except for the 1987 mayoral election reardons only election 
defeat occurred during an illfated bid for congress in 1984 he 
lost to jan meyers 
as mayor the oftencontroversial reardon worked diligently to 
bring new economic development to kansas city kan a largely 
bluecollar town with an aging and declining industrial base 
one of reardons biggest accomplishments was the years of 
negotiations he held with general motors which eventually led to 
the carmakers commitment to build a new auto plant in the city 
in an interview one year after receiving his new heart reardon 
described the transplant as a humbling experience in many ways 
its not something you think about constantly but it is something 
youre aware of on a daily basis and it is amazing 
reardon is survived by his wife helen and a son and a daughter

a love letter that a soldier wrote to his 
wife while he was being shipped overseas during world war ii was 
finally opened 44 years later by his daughter 
it was a love letter from my father to my mother said karan 
johnson of fresno who opened the letter thursday at the familys 
thanksgiving celebration 
because of a careless crew member the letter master sgt morris 
johnson penned in may 1944 never reached his wife roberta the 
couple has since died 
there are some fun things about the letter said ms johnson 
his handwriting was so much better then and opening it was 
emotional 
it was very sweet my father asked about the baby my older 
brother warren had been born a month before and my father said 
how much he missed the baby and how much he missed my mother she 
said 
johnson wrote the letter while aboard the uss caleb strong which 
was taking him and other servicemen to algeria a crew member was 
supposed to mail 235 letters written by 92 soldiers when he got back 
to the united states 
but in 1986 a pest exterminator found the duffel bag full of 
letters in an attic in raleigh nc 
james althoff president of the 781st bomb squadron association 
spent two years trying to match the wayward letters with their 
recipients the association delivered all but eight of the letters 
finding johnsons relatives was difficult because there was no 
forwarding address for the familys san francisco address althoff 
finally learned from the veterans administration that johnson a 
pharmacist had died in 1966 and his death certificate listed a 
fresno address further digging led to the discovery of karan 
johnson and delivery of the letter on sept 27 
ms johnson said her brother who was on hand for the letter 
opening was excited about the contents 
when my brother was in vietnam he was about the same age as my 
father when he wrote the letter to my mother she said he said 
he remembered writing the same type of letter to his wife 
it had a very sweet ps it said dear warren take care of 
your mommy and ill be around to check on you when i can

the next space shuttle 
landing in california could take place a week from sunday but there 
will be no public viewing because atlantis military mission is 
classified nasa said 
this is pretty standard policy on department of defense 
flights said nancy lovato a spokeswoman for the national 
aeronautics and space administration at this mojave desert military 
base 70 miles north of los angeles 
but she noted friday that nasa and the air force may reconsider 
the policy for subsequent classified shuttle flights more than 
400000 spectators gathered on the dry lake bed in october to see 
the landing of shuttle discovery the first shuttle flight since the 
1986 challenger explosion 
atlantis is scheduled to blast off from cape canaveral fla 
sometime between 632 am and 932 am est on dec 1 although the 
precise time wont be announced until nine minutes before the 
launch sources have said the launch is set for 7 am est 
the mission is expected to last three or four days which would 
mean atlantis would land on the hardpacked clay surface of rogers 
dry lake on dec 4 or 5 assuming rain doesnt turn the lake bed to 
mud and force a landing at cape canaveral fla or white sands 
nm but nasa wont announce the landing time until 24 hours 
beforehand 
while the missions purpose is secret sources have said atlantis 
and its five astronauts will place into orbit a satellite to spy on 
the soviet union 
access to edwards air force base will be restricted to official 
business only during landing operations a nasa statement said 
there will be no guest access nor will usual nasa tours be held 
during that period 
lovato said that while reporters and photographers will be 
allowed to cover the landing if they obtain nasa credentials news 
briefings customarily held on the day of and after the landing will 
not be conducted

further study of a newly isolated hormone found 
in the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the 
most common form of the disease a scientist says 
we have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be if not the 
final cause at least a major part of the disease process said 
new zealand biochemist garth cooper 
the research opens the door to the scientific study of the 
disease at a level that wasnt possible before and potentially the 
mechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging he said 
cooper who has been working with scientists at oxford 
university described the hormone research this week at the 13th 
international diabetes federation congress in sydney australia 
in his presentation cooper said the hormone dubbed amylin 
was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreases 
of diabetics 
amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity reduced insulin 
secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in type 
ii diabetes he said currently obesity is considered a major 
contributor to the disease rather than a result of it 
insulin normally controls the level of blood sugar in type ii 
diabetes also called noninsulindependent diabetes the bodys 
insulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high 
complications can include kidney disease blindness and gangrene 
that requires amputations 
type ii diabetes afflicts the majority of the nations estimated 
11 million diabetics according to the american diabetes 
association it often can be controlled through diet and exercise 
cooper said researchers hope to develop substances that block 
amylins secretion or action opening the possibility of treatment 
he also said reseachers hope to develop a test to detect diabetes 
very early in its development 
the new work is a very important finding if amylin truly 
blocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics f 
xavier pisunyer an authority on type ii diabetes said friday 
scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocks 
insulin but it is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics said 
pisunyer director of the endocrinology diabetes and nutrition 
division at st lukesroosevelt hospital center in new york

newspapers in a hotel lobby received a new home for the thanksgiving 
holidays on friday but officials said the move might only be 
temporary 
a state social worker picked up the infant at the hospital friday 
morning to take her to unidentified foster parents bluefield 
community hospital nursing supervisor lisa williams said 
callers from as far away as georgia and new york wanting to 
adopt the baby or to donate gifts continued to telephone the 
hospital even after she was gone williams said 
publicity about the infants ordeal led to such intense reation 
that hospital officials did their best to transfer the girl to her 
foster parents without the accompaniment of television cameras and 
reporters 
we kept it very very quiet williams said 
the abandoned child was called baby girl doe by police but 
hospital workers renamed her emily robin or holly lynn 
after the holiday inn where she was discovered nov 19 
the department of human services this week got court permission 
to transfer the baby to a foster home hospital social services 
director jane hood said the infant wont have a legal name until she 
is adopted 
the 6pound 9ounce infant was less than two hours old when a 
hotel worker who heard crying found her in a cardboard box tucked 
beneath a hallway heating unit 
the child bleeding from her umbilical cord was taken to the 
hospital where she was treated for hypothermia 
bluefield police chief james dent said his department has several 
leads but still has not located the childs mother 
were not on a witch hunt for the mother to crucify her dent 
said he said it would be up to the mercer county prosecutor to 
decide whether charges should be filed depending upon the mothers 
reasons for abandoning the infant 
one of the newspapers the infant was wrapped in came from 
christianburg va dent said bluefield sits on southern west

the government has postponed until january 
consideration of a plan to stop regulating longdistance telephone 
profits in favor of capping rate increases a federal communications 
commission official said 
james schlichting an aide to fcc chairman dennis r patrick 
said patrick had hoped for a vote on the proposal next month but a 
consensus among the commissioners eluded him 
there are so many complex issues and a long draft order we 
wanted to give commissioners an additional opportunity to study the 
issues and consider it in january said schlichting 
that meeting is scheduled for jan 19 
the decision to delay consideration of the proposal also 
recognizes opposition in congress he said key members have said 
the already bad relations between congress and the fcc will be 
worsened considerably if the agency adopts the proposal before 
lawmakers return to capitol hill in early january 
on wednesday the democratic staff of the house energy and 
commerce telecommunications subcommittee sent the fcc a report 
concluding that the agency is without legal authority to switch from 
profit regulation to price caps the report claims the law requires 
that phone rates be based on the cost of providing service 
the proposal would lift limits on the profits that american 
telephone amp telegraph co and the regional bell phone companies can 
earn on the interstate longdistance portions of their businesses 
instead the commission would set a ceiling on rates limiting 
increases to 3 percentage points less than annual inflation under 
the plan phone companies could choose to stay with the current 
rateofreturn regulation or switch to price caps 
a 380page revision of the plan is being circulated among 
commissioners it proposes to implement the plan in april only for 
atampt and to submit the issue of rate caps for the bell operating 
companies to further study according to sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity

home sales fell in october for the second 
straight month even though lenders were offering lower mortgage 
rates a real estate trade group said 
sales of existing singlefamily homes fell to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 363 million units last month down 11 
percent from the september sales rate the national association of 
realtors said friday 
it was the third month out of the last four in which sales 
declined they dropped an identical 11 percent in september and a 
striking 45 percent in july 
the summer rush is over and despite the window of opportunity 
afforded by low mortgage rates in october the surge of home sales 
we saw earlier has run its course said john tuccillo the groups 
chief economist but the good news is that the sales rate has 
settled in at a strong level 
fixedrate mortgages in some parts of the country edged below 10 
percent in october 
analysts said the latest drop in sales of existing homes coupled 
with a 78 percent september drop in new home sales reflected a 
slowing of the national economy 
while they did not predict a severe slump in the housing 
industry economists said the downward trend is likely to continue 
especially in view of forecasts that mortgage rates will turn higher 
the rate on 30year fixedrate mortgages rose to 1039 percent 
this week the highest level since early october the federal home 
loan mortgage corp reported friday 
many economists believe fixedrate mortgages will top 11 percent 
by early next year 
david wyss chief financial economist with data resources inc 
said that while rising mortgages would continue to dampen demand 
the market for singlefamily homes should hold steady through the 
next year 
the decline in sales was accompanied by a small drop in prices 
the median cost of an existing home sold in october was 88100 
down 100 from the september level however the price was still 41 
percent higher than a year ago when the median home price was 
84600

researchers say holocaust survivors who 
suppressed their memories of nazi death camps handled the trauma 
better than those who talked openly about the experience 
many survivors feel obligated to remember the holocaust said 
peretz lavie a psychologist at the haifa institution and supervisor 
of a new study were saying it may be better to help them forget 
about it 
lavie said the findings challenge current treatment practices for 
holocaust survivors and other trauma victims 
the study conducted by the israel institute of technologys sleep 
laboratory suggests that pressure on holocaust survivors to recall 
their experiences frequently contributed to postwar emotional 
problems 
the 23 participants were divided into two groups one including 
survivors who suffered emotional problems and the other of those who 
adjusted well 
lavie said betteradjusted survivors did not talk about the 
holocaust during waking hours and suffered fewer nightmares and 
sleep disturbances than the group with more severe problems 
he noted that in israel there is constant pressure not to forget 
the 6 million jews who died in nazi death camps 
we dont want to suppress what happened in the holocaust 
lavie told the associated press but for these people it was 
essential not to think about it in the face of the constant 
reminders they simply cut themselves off from the memories 
he said some participants told him the importance israelis place 
on remembering the holocaust often made them feel guilty about 
denying their bad experiences 
hanna kaminer a doctoral student who devised the study said 
denial seems to have been a better way for these people to adjust 
in the long run the more adjusted the individuals were the more 
they suppressed their memories 
ms kaminer said some survivors would not tell even close friends 
and relatives of their concentration camp experiences one subject 
waited until his sons 21st birthday to tell him he was a death camp 
prisoner 
the study questions theories that trauma victims who do not talk 
about their bad experiences likely will suffer from sleep disorders 
including nightmares and insomnia 
participants spent five nights in the sleep lab where 
researchers repeatedly woke them to question them about their dreams 
kaminer said betteradjusted survivors reported dreaming about 
routine experiences while the illcoping subjects more often 
dreamed of the camps 
one reported vivid dreams of the selection process at the 
auschwitz concentration camp where nazi guards decided who would go 
to the gas chambers 
until now treatment has concentrated on talking about the 
things that frightened survivors ms kaminer said now we see 
its probably better to do the opposite 
lavie said there probably is a time when they will feel more 
comfortable talking about it but for some 40 years isnt enough 
time

the highestranking woman in the 
bush presidential transition entourage has served notice that she 
doesnt want to be considered for the job of white house press 
secretary 
sheila tate who held that position during the last six months of 
bushs campaign and has served in the same capacity as he prepares 
to succeed ronald reagan on jan 20 said she concluded the job 
would be too demanding 
its the total inability to ever have your own schedule 
tate 47 said in a telephone interview friday from the transition 
office in washington i found myself in almost a permanent bad 
mood thinking about what did i want to do 
as press secretary to the transition tate had one of the 
highestranking jobs and one with a high profile and there had been 
speculation that the former public relations executive was in line 
to become the first woman to become press secretary to a president 
i have no idea what hell do at this point tate said when 
asked to speculate on where bush would turn for a press secretary 
there has been little public speculation about that position 
although the names of former bush press secretary peter teeley 
newsweek correspondent thomas defrank and cable news network 
anchorman bernard shaw have been mentioned 
meanwhile bushs transition office released a list friday of its 
109 paid staffers as well as transition volunteers who include 
bushs eldest son george and john sununu the designated white 
house chief of staff 
tate was listed as a paid staffer 
tate said she informed bush of her decision on wednesday just 
before the presidentelect left washington for a short vacation at 
his compound in kennebunkport maine 
bush has said that he wants to bring more women and minorities 
into important positions in government and in his administration 
tate said friday that she did not think taking her name out of 
competition for the press secretarys job would necessarily lessen 
the chance that it would be given to a woman 
there are plenty of qualified women she said so i 
dont take it upon myself that it is less likely 
hell find the best people for the jobs said tate who 
served as nancy reagans press secretary in the white house east 
wing from 19811985 
i know that a lot of them bush appointments will be women and 
a lot of them will be minorities she said 
tate said that the job of press secretary is particularly 
grueling and said i just have so much going on ive worked in 
the white house i do not want to go back 
she said she had no immediate career plans after she completes 
her assignment as chief spokeswoman for the transition but said she 
wants to spend more time with her family 
tate said her son hager is in his last year of high school and 
that she and her husband william are building a new home in 
mclean va 
she said that bush asked me my thought processes in deciding 
to withdraw as a candidate for the press secretarys job and said 
he understood my concerns and we left it at that

nowhere has the governments 
counterattack against black militancy been more intense than in 
onceembattled townships ringing this industrial port city 
bannings detentions and deployment of army troops have enabled 
the government to regain control of what some activists viewed two 
years ago as the first liberated territory in south africa 
monitoring groups estimate onethird of 30000 activists detained 
without charge since mid1986 were from the eastern cape region 
around port elizabeth more so than in other areas prominent 
detainees remain in custody about 55 local leaders are in their 
third year of detention 
the crackdown has been so effective that even underground 
opposition activity is minimal township residents say but a spirit 
of resistance remains despite a government campaign to win good 
will by upgrading services 
less than 10 percent of eligible voters here disregarded a call 
by antiapartheid groups to boycott recent local elections surveys 
show overwhelming support for the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla movement which has many leaders from the regions xhosa 
people 
this area has had the most resilient resistance to apartheid 
said the rev mcebisi xundu an anglican minister on the surface 
it does seem the people have been made to lose their spirit i dont 
think they have 
in 1985 the peak of nationwide black unrest port elizabeths 
antiapartheid groups organized one of the most potent consumer 
boycotts in south african history prompting white business leaders 
to open negotiations militant street committees held sway in many 
black areas sustained student boycotts closed schools even the 
security forces sometimes could not move freely 
in june 1986 the government declared a national state of 
emergency activists were jailed the townships sealed off with 
barbed wire and checkpoints 
when they the security forces moved in they assisted the 
community to identify the government not as a savior but as an 
enemy said mike mjekula staff member of a regional human rights 
organization 
the people decided to be quiet they were not able to fight 
this overwhelming force he said instead they adopted a more 
subtle form of resistance they would not comply with the 
governments wishes 
like other areas where black militancy was strong parts of the 
eastern cape are targets of a hearts and minds campaign to 
realize government hopes that better housing and services will give 
blacks a stake in preserving the status quo 
the government has done sterling work building new suburbs 
trying to uplift people said sakkie louw a port elizabeth 
legislator from the governing national party once a man has a 
good home a good roof over his head he will be a different man 
from the one living under plastic bags not having basic things like 
water and electricity 
in two new townships for middleclass blacks the government 
seems to have won over some residents mostly civil servants 
they now have something to lose said judy chalmers regional 
coordinator of the black sash civil rights group theyre not 
going to want to be involved in the next wave of unrest if they can 
possibly avoid it 
in older larger townships she said theres a feeling of 
waiting 
everybody is quite relieved to have a respite from the horrors 
of 198586 the kids are back in school the leaders are in 
detention but the hearts and minds have not been won 
for the moment the new middleclass developments are a 
phenomenon nearly half of the halfmillion blacks around port 
elizabeth live in shacks most others inhabit aging overcrowded 
boxlike houses 
some shantytowns red location and sowetobythesea for 
example are among the most squalid in the country tens of 
thousands of squatters live under threat of forced removal 
a recent study calculated more than half of port elizabeths 
blacks are unemployed the highest number for any major south 
african city 
the automobile industry for decades port elizabeths major 
employer has suffered hard times lately as sales were slowed by 
rising prices thousands of jobs were lost two years ago when ford 
motor co sold its operation to south african owners who moved the 
plant to pretoria 
in many grim respects the eastern cape is a mirror image of an 
unacceptable future other south africans will have to face unless 
timeous action is taken wrote rory riordan director of the port 
elizabethbased human rights trust 
referring to other experts warnings that south africa faces 
recession and worsening racial tension riordan writes we have 
seen the future in port elizabeth and it doesnt work 
bobby stephenson a city councilor representing the 
antiapartheid progressive federal party said there are limits to 
what port elizabeths whites are able and willing to do to help 
their black neighbors 
security is the first priority in the minds of most whites 
he said they were very frightened in 1985

the prime minister of st lucia says 
seven eastern caribbean countries should unite as one nation to 
increase their economic clout and decrease the likelihood of coups 
john compton citing the proposed uscanada free trade 
agreement and the success of the common market said the longer 
we hesitate to form a political union the more difficult the task 
becomes as the determination of some of our members appears to 
flag 
compton speaking at a meeting of leaders of the sevennation 
organization of eastern caribbean states is the strongest supporter 
for combining st lucia st vincent grenada dominica st kitts 
the british colony of montserrat and antigua which opposes 
unification 
the six supporting nations of the caribbean organization signed 
an agreement in july 1987 for political union but there has been no 
time set and little real action 
compton said the individual islandstates cannot survive alone 
he said the vulnerability of tiny states was demonstrated this month 
by a coup attempt in the maldives off southern india which 
indicates the steps we should take if our countries are not to be 
the next target of mercenary adventure 
compton said the open market planned for 1992 by the european 
economic community and a trade agreement between canada and the 
united states to become law jan 1 should be an encouragement to 
those who dare advance the cause of unity 
the twoday summit focused on political unity proposals for 
unifying the islands police and customs and an end to the use of 
passports for interisland travel 
excluding antiguas 100000 citizens the six prounity countries 
have a combined population of about 450000 the seven 
englishspeaking islands already have an integrated economy 
including a common central bank and a common currency the eastern 
caribbean dollar 
compton said this week that even without a consensus on unity 
those of us who are ready to go will move on and allow the others 
to join along the way 
of the six supporting members the leeward islands of st kitts 
and montserrat have been the most hesitant the four windward 
islands which share the region with the frenchowned islands of 
martinique and guadeloupe have been the strongest supporters of 
unification

iran accused of executing 1140 
dissidents says it will allow un human rights inspectors into the 
country before years end 
reynaldo galindo pohl the uns special reporter on human 
rights in iran issued a report three weeks ago accusing iran of 
ordering a wave of executions of opposition members in july 
august and september 
iranian un ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati said friday 
that galindo pohl and his investigators would receive the full 
cooperation of the government of the islamic republic of iran in all 
respects before the end of 1988 for the purpose of carrying out his 
mandate 
australian ambassador michael costello this week asked iran to 
give a clear unconditional and public indication of its readiness 
to allow a visit by human rights investigators within a specified 
period 
galindo pohl and the un special commission on human rights have 
never been allowed to visit iran to check reports of abuses and 
instead have had to rely mainly on reports in iranian and western 
media 
mahallati said galindo pohls previous report relied on the 
peoples mujahedeen opposition group which he described as a 
terrorist organization filled with the bogus allegations leveled 
against the islamic republic of iran with clear malice purely 
political and propaganda objectives 
it would be farfetched to logically expect to find any truth 
in their allegations concerning a regime against which they have 
sworn enmity he said 
therefore we consider our call for full cooperation with the 
special representative as a healthy challenge to him mahallati 
said 
galindo pohls interim report cited mass executions in iran from 
july through september that included 1140 political prisoners as 
well as other common criminals 
the executions followed a july 2528 raid into iran by the 
national liberation army the armed wing of the peoples mujahedeen 
and irans accepted in midjuly of a ceasefire with iraq the truce 
took effect aug 20 
his report also said persecution of bahai worshipers continues 
although some bahais have been released from jail in recent months 
bahais are a 19th century offshoot of islam viewed by most 
moslems as a heretic sect the estimated 300000 bahais in iran are 
denied the right to practice their faith and cannot obtain higher 
education or work for the government

twelve villagers and 10 rebels were 
killed when guerrillas with automatic rifles and grenades battled 
local defense forces at a remote hamlet the government said 
the defense ministry said friday the attack shows the rebels do 
not really want a ceasefire 
a ministry communique said the rebels attacked el guabo 137 
miles east of managua at 2 am wednesday the rebels also wounded 
four villagers and kidnapped a woman it added 
contrary to accusations by spokesmen from the reagan 
administration blaming the sandinista popular army for breaking the 
agreement to halt offensive military operations the facts show 
the contrary those truly responsible for systematically violating 
the ceasefire are the counterrevolutionary forces the ministry 
said 
washington cut off military aid last february to the nicaraguan 
rebels known as contras but continued supplying them with 
humanitarian aid 
the government and the contras agreed to a ceasefire in march 
but talks aimed at a more comprehensive peace broke off in 
september each side accused the other of violating the truce

top advisers to presidentelect 
george bush remain deeply divided over whether former sen john 
tower should be named secretary of defense sources have said 
bush also sidestepped questions friday about reports he would 
back 35 billion to 5 billion in medicare cuts but he pledged to 
zero in quickly on the problem of cutting the us budget deficit 
i keep reading in the papers a lot of things im supposed to be 
doing that i dont know anything about bush told reporters on 
friday 
bush suggested he had made no decisions yet on budget cuts 
dont make judgments based on stories that dont really have 
any authority behind them he said 
sources close to the vice president who spoke only on the 
condition of anonymity said the issue of selecting a defense 
secretary remained up in the air the sources said top advisers 
remain sharply divided on earlier plans to fill the post with tower 
the former senate armed services chairman from texas 
bush himself has given no clues on whom he might select but in 
recent days has appeared to discourage suggestions that it would be 
tower in any event bush has said that he has not yet made up his 
mind and that the decision will be his alone 
bush visiting his familys vacation home worked for several 
hours on friday in the small cabin he uses as an office but told 
reporters he had no appointments scheduled during his thanksgiving 
holiday 
bush on friday swooped into town to visit a wine and cheese 
store then went to a video store where he rented the movie 
broadcast news he also stopped in at a hardware store and a 
golf equipment shop at a local country club 
spokesman stephen hart said suggestions on medicare cuts were 
completely speculative its premature for anyone to speculate 
about the budget 
bush declined to comment further on news accounts including one 
in fridays editions of the washington post that his administration 
would go along with some 35 to 5 billion in proposed medicare 
cuts expected to be recommended by outgoing president reagan in his 
final budget submission to congress in january 
asked whether he would advocate chops in medicare funding bush 
said my view is ill address the whole budget problem very soon 
bush pledged earlier this week to send negotiators to meet with 
members of congress on the first day of his presidency 
that strategy was in keeping with a proposal by the man bush 
picked to be budget director richard darman that bush not submit 
his own rewrite of the reagan budget but instead work behind the 
scenes with congress to forge a compromise 
bush has insisted he will not support any form of tax increase 
and would seek to reduce the nations 150 billion a year budget 
deficit with a flexible freeze 
such a freeze would hold overall spending at the level of 
inflation pairing additional spending in new areas with new 
cutbacks in others 
bush aides have said that the only item not on the table for such 
cuts is social security benefits remarks that made it all but 
certain that the new administration would advocate cuts in other 
socalled entitlement programs like medicare 
meanwhile bush aides said a meeting this weekend with defeated 
democratic rival michael dukakis would not occur they said it will 
probably happen next week in washington 
the bushes had dinner friday night at their home with cardinal 
bernard law the archbishop of boston

pat wolke sat at a new soda fountain eating 
frozen yogurt that may be no great shakes in other towns but its 
a triumph for oncedesolate condon which not long ago advertised 
for a few good residents 
i love frozen yogurt said wolke the district attorney and 
the only lawyer in gilliam county im so glad this place opened 
about 60 new residents have arrived to help fill condons empty 
houses and storefronts and next year a landfill expected to bring 
1 million a year to the county will open 
its the condon comeback theyre calling it said gretchen 
larue wolkes secretary who came here with her condonnative 
husband to get away from bigcity life in portland 
two years ago condon a town of 715 people east of the cascades 
had no frozen yogurt and not much of a future this town in northern 
oregon lived and died on how much rain fell on the surrounding wheat 
fields 
wolke real estate agent boyd harris home telephone co manager 
bill berray and timesjournal newspaper editor mac stinchfield 
decided they had had enough of watching their town die 
they ran a little ad in the los angeles times touting the town as 
having lots of clean air and cheap houses but practically no jobs or 
crime 
when they placed the newspaper advertisement they never dreamed 
they would soon be watching themselves on the evening news 
when it hit national tv it went nuts harris recalled 
recently over 2 million worth of advertising we got for free 
they have sent about 4000 replies to inquiries about condon 
we analyzed the letters to see why people were looking at 
condon harris said the biggest reason was safety people are 
scared out in those cities 
but with no jobs available most of the new residents have been 
retired people with enough money to go south for the winter 
among the few new condonites able to make a living here are ed 
and priscilla cathcart who moved from los angeles and bought the 
local texaco station 
the lack of people really i think is what we like the 
most said cathcart but its funny we know more people here 
than we did in la 
stinchfield conceded no new jobs exist for young families 
but thats where the new dump comes in 
we dont say dump corrected harris we say landfill 
whatever you call it the 2000acre plot that oregon waste 
systems inc is developing outside arlington on the 
washingtonoregon border and about 20 miles north of condon will 
mean about 30 new jobs when the landfill opens next summer said 
harris 
charging a fee tied to the amount of garbage dumped gilliam 
county expects to bring in 1 million a year 
wolke would like to see the money used to give homeowners a break 
by cutting in half property taxes that are among the highest in the 
state others want to see the money used for economic development a 
task force is working out a plan 
with garbage dumps filling up across the nation and many towns 
uneasy about burying it in their back yards condon sees a great 
future in waste disposal theres even talk of taking garbage from 
seattle and spokane wash 
its honest capitalistic enterprise said harris theres a 
labor force of young people who have lived here and who would move 
back here if there was a job

northeast iowa is hog and cattle 
country but raleigh buckmaster makes his bucks by raising deer for 
the dinner table 
buckmaster gave up his veterinary practice three years ago to 
enter deer farming which he says is a fledgling industry in the 
united states but a major economic force in new zealand and a 
growing business in canada 
last year the gross national product of new zealand venison 
exceeded the sheep industry a mainstay of the island nation 
buckmaster said recently theres 600000 deer being farmed in new 
zealand 
at buckmasters capoli ranch about 400 head of deer graze behind 
a wire fence on forested bluffs overlooking the mississippi river 
he protects his herd from dogs and coyotes with three llamas that 
patrol behind the fence the llamas provide more than adequate 
protection buckmaster said but he has guns just in case 
otherwise buckmaster runs his deer farm like a cattle ranch 
the does are the cows the fawns are the calves and the bucks are 
the bulls he said 
his stock arent the whitetailed deer of the american woods but 
fallow deer a breed of european origin thats 30 percent smaller 
than its us cousin 
the deer graze during the spring summer and fall and are fed 
hay and shelled corn during winter 
that diet and the lack of stress whitetailed deer experience in 
the wild means that fallow deer venison doesnt have the sometime 
gamey taste of whitetailed venison he said 
fallow deer is considered the worlds finest venison 
buckmaster said 
nutritionally venison is better for you than any other red 
meat and some white meat including chicken he said claiming 
that his product is practically cholesterolfree with onethird 
the calories of beef and less than 8 percent fat 
capoli ranch has its own slaughterhouse freezer and other 
facilities for processing and packaging venison buckmaster and his 
wife joellyn sell summer sausages and other deer meat products 
through catalogs 
most of buckmasters customers are from out of state with the 
bulk of his sales coming from arkansas colorado and montana 
he said hes always been interested in deer and began 
researching the prospects of operating a deer farm after hearing of 
similar ventures in new zealand 
they started 15 years ago raising deer buckmaster said 
they have developed a technology for raising deer intensively 
they are the pros 
deer farming in canada is picking up and deer farming in texas 
is picking up in a big way he said in the united states deer 
farming is in an absolutely embryonic state 
buckmaster is convinced the market for fallow deer venison in 
this country is growing 
in california in the last six months theyve increased their 
venison imports 300 percent he said in new york you can go 
into a restaurant and find fresh fallow venison at any good menu

shook buildings and sent tremors from michigan to washington 
about 50 people near the quakes epicenter at chicoutimi quebec 
suffered minor cuts and bruises but no serious injuries were 
reported in canada or in the united states one american said he was 
knocked out of his seat others said windows rattled dishes fell 
from shelves and ceilings cracked 
seismologists said the quake registered 60 on the richter scale 
enough to cause severe damage but damage was relatively minor 
janet drysdale of the geological survey of canada placed the 
epicenter about 90 miles northwest of quebec city and just east of 
the st lawrence river along a minor fault zone 
it was pretty dreadful said irene bouchard in chicoutimi 
some of our picture frames crashed to the floor our animals 
started running about and then they hid themselves 
a shopper at a chicoutimi shopping center said windows broke 
bits of ceiling fell it created a real panic people crying it was 
unbelievable 
the tremors knocked out power in montreal and quebec city and 
elsewhere in the province but apparently caused more fear than 
damage

the first said charlie popejoy 80 of the central ontario city 
of orillia 
in the united states the quake was felt from the great lakes to 
the atlantic coast and from maine to washington but there were no 
reports of damage 
i was sitting watching tv and all at once i started feeling 
dizzy said roy tabikha of cambridge mass i thought there was 
something wrong with me 
peter dehlinger professor of geophysics at the university of 
connecticut said the quake generated 1000 times more energy than 
anything previously recorded in that state he said connecticut had 
an earthquake measuring 35 to 4 in the late 1960s in long island 
sound 
michael luongo jr of litchfield conn was watching television 
when the tremor hit and thought he had a visitor 
i was convinced there was someone behind my couch shaking it 
for five six seconds said luongo i peeked over the top of it 
the couch to actually look and shook my head in disbelief 
gary wilson was sitting in a chair on the second floor of his 
otisville ny home when the chair started to move 
it was like sitting on top of a bowl of jello he said 
in albany new york gov mario cuomo was in the executive 
mansion i did feel it very definitely the chandelier shook the 
floor moved it lasted about 10 seconds but it was something ill 
remember for much longer than that cuomo said 
clifford williams of the pennsylvania state police said one

floor of the prudential center while about 120 people were dining 
said maitre d stephen brown 
the entire dining room felt it everyone felt they were 
becoming dizzy or faint they all sort of smiled and looked at each 
other he said 
tremors began at 646 pm est and lasted 15 seconds to two 
minutes canadian press reported 
john adams of the geological survey of canada in ottawa said it

a greek banking and publishing tycoon embroiled in 
a multimilliondollar scandal that has rocked the greek government 
fled his homeland in fear of his life his lawyer says 
george koskotas knew he probably would face extradition 
proceedings in the united states but came here from brazil for 
safety washington attorney ron liebman said at a bail hearing for 
koskotas friday 
the 34yearold banker fled greece on nov 6 after being indicted 
on five counts of fraud and embezzlement alleging he siphoned more 
than 135 million from the bank of crete of which he was chairman 
the facts under which mr koskotas came here indicate that the

states he said at the us district court hearing 
mr koskotas in imminent fear of his life came to the one 
place in this world where he felt that he and his family would be 
safe from murder liebman said 
but us magistrate joyce alexander denied bail after assistant 
us attorney victor a wild argued that bail should not be set in 
an extradition case and that any flight by koskotas would have 
international repercussions 
koskotas was being held in a federal facility in massachusetts 
and a review hearing was tentatively set for wednesday 
the scandal has embarrassed the government of premier andreas 
papandreou and prompted the resignations of two government ministers 
koskotas had been ordered to remain in greece while officials 
investigated alleged irregularities at the bank of crete 
in athens spyros papadatos temporary commissioner appointed by 
the greek government to investigate the case said in a report that

collateral and gifts to soccer clubs athletes business associates 
journalists and friends

had acquired a controlling interest in the bank in 1984 after 
working in its central athens branch for two years as an accountant 
he also built a publishing empire and bought a controlling interest 
in a athens soccer club 
koskotas was arrested wednesday night by fbi agents at hanscom

thousands of animal rights activists including tv celebrities 
staged antifur protests from beverly hills to fifth avenue urging 
fur owners to return their pricey garments and end animal suffering 
fur coats are worn by beautiful animals and ugly people 
declared tshirts worn by some of the 50 protesters who turned out 
in san francisco for the nationwide furfree friday organized by 
transspecies unlimited among the demonstrators was amanda blake of 
gunsmoke tv series fame 
in new york city television game show host bob barker led about 
2000 demonstrators chanting fur is murder dont buy fur as 
they marched down fifth avenue 
about 40 people picketed outside saks fifth avenue and 
neimanmarcus department stores in beverly hills 25 each 
demonstrated at a boston fur store and a shopping center in 
harrisburg pa 
in new york some protesters occasionally spat on furclad 
passersby 
barker said a woman admonished him shame on you one of your 
people spit on me 
i said only one barker said 
dozens of shoppers stopped along the sidewalk to stare and point 
one couple sporting his and her furs beat a hasty retreat across 
the street 
my fur is beautiful please dont kill me or my friends read 
a sandwich sign worn by a labrador retriever 
racoon pelts dangled from one mans outstretched fists another 
carried a realisticlooking human skeleton one woman trudged along 
in a beaver costume and another wore bunny ears 
barker who quit his job as host of the miss usa and miss 
universe beauty contests last year to protest the awarding of fur 
coats as prizes said the demonstration had been successful beyond 
our wildest expectations 
san francisco organizers estimated they received 30 to 50 furs in 
a fur drop intended to get the items out of circulation 
organizers said the collected furs would be defaced and used for 
educational purposes 
demonstrators wore paper masks and carried signs as they marched 
around san franciscos elegant union square shopping area some 
carried traps while others dressed up as a reindeer a panda bear 
and a fox 
blake best known for her role as miss kitty in gunsmoke 
wore a fakefur trimmed hat 
explaining her decision 25 years ago to stop wearing real fur 
she said its agony for the animals and i dont believe that 
animals should have to suffer for some dumb broads vanity or for 
some stupid mans vanity 
blake defended the leather boots she was wearing saying 
producers use the whole cow thats important its not a trash 
animal 
protesters objected to the conditions in which animals raised for 
fur are kept alleging they are kept in isolation in cramped 
wirebottomed cages they also object to the ways animals are killed 
to protect their pelts which they said included trapping gassing 
suffocation and electrocution 
belkins furs owner alan belkin whose business is one block away 
from union square rejected protesters claims 
all the furs we use today are raised theyre not wild he 
said 
animals are raised well in clean environments partly because 
mistreatment would make their pelts valueless he added calling 
animal rights activists extremists who will not be satisfied until 
furs are not used at all 
among those handing over their furs in san francisco were palo 
alto humane society president patricia elson and her daughter kate 
who turned in two coats 
im ashamed to wear it said elson holding a brown nutria 
coat she valued at something under 1000 im ashamed to have it 
in my closet every time i see it in my closet i feel sick you 
realize you cant wear them for fashion anymore

on a campus where basketball players are courted 
with a religious zeal nevadas brightest students are getting a 
second look thanks to a university chief who resolved to reverse 
this states brain drain 
shortly after his arrival four years ago robert maxson initiated 
a program that makes the university of nevadalas vegas the only 
university in the country offering a fouryear scholarship to the 
valedictorian of every high school in the state 
weve always offered full scholarships to athletically talented 
youngsters he said in an interview this week i think thats 
ok but it made sense to me that if we were going to offer full 
scholarships to athletically talented youngsters we ought to be 
able to offer the same to academically talented youngsters 
a oneliner often heard in this basketballcrazy entertainment 
capital is that someday someone would build a great university 
befitting the stature of the nevadalas vegas runnin rebels a 
perennial college basketball power 
maxson a gregarious 50yearold texas transplant took the 
challenge seriously when he came to unlv from the university of 
houston in 1984 
he has guided the university through its greatest period of 
growth increasing enrollment from 10000 to 15000 
he has coaxed millions out of the states casino owners and 
corporate giants for scholarships and educational programs he sold 
the summa corp on helping to fund an engineering school named for 
the companys founder howard hughes 
maxson launched the scholarship program after arriving in this 
glitter city and learning that the gaming industry can be a major 
resource for educating nevadas young people at the time 46 
percent of nevadas high school graduates were leaving the state to 
continue their education 
we were ranked 49th in the country second only to alaska in 
the number of young people we were losing maxson recalled we 
knew if we were going to build a great university we were going to 
have to keep the best and brightest in nevada 
maxsons answer offer the valedictorian of each of nevadas 53 
high schools a 10000 fouryear scholarship to unlv no 
questions asked major in anything you want recipients are still 
free to receive other scholarships 
the onetime 10000 scholarship is more than enough to cover 
tuition at less than 1000 a year with the rest going toward 
room board and other expenses 
maxson went searching for the dollars to make it work he 
recalled touting the program at a luncheon meeting and being 
approached by margaret elardi owner of the frontier hotel and 
casino who told maxson she wanted to give something back to the 
state by investing in the young people of nevada 
maxson told her it would take 1 million four days later the 
margaret elardi nevada scholarship program for valedictorians at 
unlv was launched 
in the four years since the program began 101 nevada high school 
valedictorians have received elardi scholarships previously unlv 
never had more than a halfdozen valedictorians enrolled at one 
time maxson said 
he said the program has resulted in a substantial turnaround 
in the percentage of nevada high school students who continue their 
education in state but he had no figures friday 
because of this program not only are we getting the top 
graduates but weve found that other good students follow these 
scholastic leaders to unlv maxson said we think weve helped 
stop the brain drain 
there are always going to be students who want to go away from 
home for various reasons unique programs at other schools 
maturing a lot of reasons he said but our philosophy has 
always been that we dont want a single student to leave nevada 
because they feel they have to to get a good education 
mrs elardi shuns publicity and did not return calls for an 
interview but she remains close to the students she helps educate 
meeting with them three times a year at dinners and writing to 
remind them home is nevada 
the program is providing a full ride for people like janet 
pachano 20 a hopi indian who finished top among the 15 graduates 
of her high school on the owyhee indian reservation and rachelle 
reiersgord 19 the second graduate in the history of the tiny high 
school at jackpot population 500 to go to college 
ms reiersgord valedictorian of her 13member class and now a 
sophomore at unlv plans to become a doctor 
without the elardi scholarship 
i would probably be doing what most kids in town do when they 
get out of high school work for one of the casinos she said

the warsaw pact has a massive numerical 
superiority over nato in conventional arms on the ground and in the 
air a nato report said 
nato secretary general manfred woerner said the report issued 
friday does not show a more defensive posture on moscows part 
despite recent statements from president mikhail s gorbachev 
i appeal to mr gorbachev to match his words by deeds 
woerner said the report also aims to challenge moscow to issue its 
own data he said 
the report conventional forces in europe the facts does 
not touch on the quality of weapons only their numbers woerner 
said the numbers indicate moscow has the potential to launch a 
surprise attack 
the study is not the basis for nato negotiators at the 
conventional stability talks expected to begin in vienna early next 
year he said 
these negotiations will have their own counting rules for 
conventional arms systems that are more detailed and address not 
just quantity of arms but also their relative quality he said 
the report cites east bloc arms systems western allies will 
likely want reduced including tanks and other armored vehicles 
artillery antitank weapons air defense systems helicopters as 
well as overall troop strength 
the study says the warsaw pact nations have a large superiority 
in 11 major arms systems and that in eight of these the soviet union 
alone outguns all nato nations and its warsaw pact allies combined 
the report cites these figures for individual arms systems for 
the warsaw pact nations with comparable figures for nato in brackets 
main battle tanks 51500 16424 armored infantry fighting 
vehicles 22400 4153 other armored vehicles 71000 35351 
artillery 43400 13857 antitank weapons 44200 18240 air 
defense systems 24400 10109 helicopters 3700 2419 
personnel 3 million 22 million and combat aircraft 8250 3977 
rozanne ridgway assistant secretary of state for european 
affairs told a washington news conference the report demonstrates 
the warsaw pact has a substantial superiority in conventional 
forces on the ground 
she cited the massive forward deployment of armored forces 
organized and equipped for rapid and offensive operations 
alton keel us envoy to nato said the report shows east bloc 
nations maintain forces bigger than those of nato in all heavy 
weapons systems and that the soviet union retains forces all out of 
proportion to those of any other european state 
the nato study focuses on ground and air forces since naval 
forces will not be subject to the talks 
keel said he expected the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact nations 
to begin the conventional arms talks very early next year in the 
austrian capital 
the talks will cover the territory between the atlantic ocean and 
the ural mountains 
they are to replace the mutual and balanced force reduction talks 
on force levels in seven nato and four warsaw pact nations in 
central europe which have remained fruitless after almost 15 years 
steven ledogar the chief us negotiator in vienna said friday 
that preliminary meetings on the conventional stability talks were 
deadlocked over procedural concerns by france a new meeting will be 
held next week 
at issue is how to link the talks to the 35nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe which comprises the nato and 
warsaw pact nations and 12 neutral countries officials said 
france wants to link the talks more firmly to the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe than the united states which 
wants the neutrals to stay away from eastwest arms talks

the federal governments lawsuit alleging new 
jersey police examinations were discriminatory could result in jobs 
with back pay and seniority for thousands of blacks hispanics and 
women who failed the tests 
the lawsuit against new jersey announced friday by the justice 
department could lead to personnel changes in hundreds of local 
police departments and cost the state millions of dollars 
it followed months of negotiations between the justice department 
and the state personnel department which designed and administered 
the test the justice department filed the lawsuit wednesday after 
talks broke down agency spokesman mark weaver said in washington 
we realize there could be a substantial cost to the state but 
thats the price you pay when you discriminate weaver said 
these people need to be held accountable 
the justice department is running true to form in discussing 
things with the press before they let the principals know said 
eugene mccaffrey jr the state commissioner of personnel who 
oversees new jersey civil service positions its a nonbiased 
valid test mccaffrey was named in the lawsuit 
according to the action federal officials have sought to change 
the test because it discriminates against blacks hispanics and 
women the three groups have failed at a higher rate than white 
males the lawsuit said 
parts of the physical and written test have no bearing on 
measuring qualifications to be a police officer the action alleged 
weaver declined to provide statistics to support the claims and 
would not cite specific examples from the test because of the 
pending litigation 
the states police examination is used to select candidates for 
appointment to entrylevel police positions by the state and more 
than 250 municipalities 
deputy personnel commissioner robert j hartman the former 
director of examinations for the department denied the test is 
discriminatory but said state officials have been working with the 
justice department to change it he said the lawsuit surprised him 
because he thought negotiations were going smoothly 
if theres any way i could accept anything they have to offer 
without lowering our standards id grab it hartman said but i 
couldnt afford to just go out and sign the first consent order they 
gave me thats why weve been negotiating 
he said the stumbling blocks to a settlement included the justice 
departments insistence on invalidating all examinations since 1984 
hartman suggested that would hurt minority group members who already 
are on lists of those who have passed the test since police 
departments hire from those lists 
the examination has remained largely the same for about five 
years and 5000 to 6000 people have taken it each year hartman 
said about half that number failed 
the justice department is pressing for reinstatement of people 
who would have been hired had they passed the test since 1984 with 
full back pay and seniority 
settlement cost could run into millions of dollars mostly paid 
by local police departments hartman said 
i dont think for a minute this things ever going to get to 
trial were too close he said but were going to have big 
problems if it does go and we lose

president roh taewoo today asked the 
nation to forgive his predecessor chun doohwan and promised 
amnesty and compensation for political prisoners jailed under chuns 
rule 
i will liquidate past wrongdoings and carry out bold reforms in 
the government and governing party in the quest of a new era roh 
said in a nationwide television address 
roh pledged a major shuffle of the government and governing 
democratic justice party and a revision of undemocratic laws to 
prevent more abuses 
but opponents immediately rejected rohs appeal and said chun 
must fully account for abuses during his sevenyear term both major 
opposition parties called for a full investigation 
thousands of dissidents and radical students braved freezing 
temperatures and staged street protests in seoul to demand that chun 
be arrested and punished 
students hurling firebombs and rocks clashed with riot police in 
central seoul police armored vans fired volleys of tear gas to 
drive back students 
arrest chun doohwan punish roh taewoo protesters yelled 
kbs the state broadcasting system said about 5000 people took 
part in the protests thousands of riot police blocked the students 
as they tried to march through the center of the city 
police had no immediate word on injuries or arrests several 
police officers were set on fire by firebombs 
roh stopped short of granting chun a pardon but he said any 
prosecution of the former ruler would be unfair political 
retribution 
when he himself apologized deeply how can we stone the former 
president alone on the grounds that there were many mistakes in the 
past roh said 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in 
1980 went into internal exile wednesday after apologizing to the 
nation for corruption and other abuses under his government he 
stepped down in february at the end of a sevenyear term 
chun said he took full responsibility for misdeeds under his 
government he said he was surrendering all his property including 
about 24 million in efforts to atone 
chun living in a remote buddhist monastery on the east coast 
listened to rohs speech on radio but had no comment an aide said 
roh a former general and once close ally of chun is trying to 
defuse public anger against chun without damaging his own 
administration 
the roh government is closely identified with chuns 
administration the president took office in february after a split 
in the opposition enabled him to win elections in december 
roh said the government would take the lead in exposing past 
abuses and a special unit would be set up for that purpose but he 
also said he wanted the sensational hearings by the national 
assembly into chuns government to end by the end of the year 
the hearings have galvanized south korea and helped fuel 
antigovernment protests 
roh said he would grant amnesty to political prisoners jailed 
under chun and restore the civil rights of those already freed he 
said generosity would be shown to opponents arrested under his 
government 
government officials said the cases of 266 prisoners convicted of 
political offenses or facing trial were being reviewed and as many 
as possible would be freed around dec 10 opposition parties 
contend about 1000 political prisoners are held 
roh also promised compensation for victims of the 1980 uprising 
in the southern city of kwangju which was suppressed by the army 
with the deaths of about 200 people he also promised compensation 
and exoneration for people killed or dismissed for political reasons 
under chun 
he said political party funds would be put under open supervision 
to prevent abuses officials and politicians would not be allowed to 
force businesses to make political contributions special favors for 
businesses would be ended and undemocratic laws would be revised or 
removed including the harsh national security laws 
chun has denied any personal corruption but some of his 
associates and relatives have been convicted or charged with 
misappropriating millions of dollars in government funds many of 
the charges involve raising secret political funds often by forcing 
businesses to make donations 
roh said he would enforce law and order and said the violent 
activities of radical students and labor activists will not be 
tolerated 
radical students and dissidents calling for the arrest of chun 
have clashed several times with riot police in seoul and other 
cities in recent days the radicals contend roh is a continued front 
for military rule and have called for his fall

ms moore graduated from ashland high school in 1957 and went on 
to oberlin college then earned a masters at catholic university in

clashes today between stonethrowing palestinians and troops in 
the occupied gaza strip left three 14yearold youths with shotgun 
wounds to the legs at the nuseirat refugee camp and gaza strip 
village of zawaydah officials at gazas ahli arab hospital said

was transferred from shifa hospital to an israeli hospital the 
doctors said

oil prices soared more than 10 percent as 
opec ministers awaited word from iran on whether it would ratify a 
proposed sixmonth oil reduction accord 
the ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries planned to return tonight to vienna to resume their winter 
conference in hopes of formally approving a pact to slash the 
cartels rampant oil production from more than 22 million barrels a 
day estimated now to 185 million barrels daily 
in response to the tentative accord futures price for january 
delivery of brent the benchmark north sea crude jumped 165 a 
barrel to 1442 friday in london trading 
us petroleum exchanges closed early wednesday for the fourday 
thanksgiving holiday but analysts said us markets would match the 
european gains if the opec ministers signed a final accord over the 
weekend 
futures prices on the new york mercantile exchange closed 
slightly higher wednesday in anticipation opec would reach some sort 
of agreement the contract for january delivery of west texas 
intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude closed 11 cents 
higher at 1397 a barrel 
one of the key provisions of the pact would grant iraq production 
parity with its persian gulf enemy iran something iran had fought 
bitterly however the proposal also reportedly would allow iran to 
increase its production and maintain its 14 percent share of opec 
production 
analysts said they expect an agreement to bolster prices in the 
short term but said they doubted the accord would last long enough 
to boost prices to opecs target of 18 a barrel 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh flew friday to tehran 
to consult with his government which signed a ceasefire with iraq 
in august to halt their eightyear war 
aghazadeh said in tehran today that he will consult with irans 
cabinet on sunday about how to respond to the proposed opec 
production ceiling tehran radio said in a report monitored in 
cyprus 
even if the 13 nations sign the plan analysts are uncertain it 
could hold 
recent cheating on cartel quotas has added to the glut of oil on 
the market driving down prices 
william byers an analyst at bear stearns amp co in new york 
said we dont know if opec nations are going to adhere to an 
agreement 
if so he said prices could go higher but thats an 
assumption thats premature to make 
steve hanke economics professor at johns hopkins university in 
baltimore said cheating could occur right from day one and in 
fact theres every reason to believe it will 
fergus macleod an oil analyst with barclays de zoete wedd in 
london said he doubted whether the price of west texas intermediate 
would climb beyond 17 a barrel 
each rise of 1 in the price of crude oil theoretically means a 
pickup of 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices although oil 
companies do not always pass along the full increase 
macleod said in terms of its impact on prices at the gas pump 
you may not get a direct feedthrough from the increase in oil 
prices its difficult to pass on the full increase he said 
ian graham an analyst at the london brokerage county natwest 
noted companies had not reduced gasoline prices when oil prices 
slumped 
there seems little justification for increasing them on the way 
back up he said 
the ministers began their winter meeting monday and then recessed 
for closeddoor negotiations to try to end a bitter dispute between 
rivals iran and iraq 
iraq had been demanding an equal production quota in any new 
accord with iran but aghazadeh had said no 
it appears that the production agreement will give each country 
the same quota at 264 million barrels a day 
iran now has a cap of 24 million barrels a day 
iraq was given a ceiling of 15 million barrels in the current 
pact but has ignored it analysts estimate its production at 27 
million barrels a day 
to cut the deal the ministers agreed to let iran pump more oil 
while paring other countries output levels to meet the new quotas 
the other countries agreed to give up some of their production 
share to make up iraqs quota but details were not disclosed 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates 
and venezuela

iraq and iran exchanged 69 disabled soldiers 
today but both countries returned fewer prisoners of war than 
promised under an agreement worked out by the international red 
cross 
red cross officials in baghdad told the associated press iran 
sent only 51 iraqi prisoners and iraq reciprocated by returning just 
18 iranians 
the red cross refused to comment on why the tehran government 
repatriated 51 prisoners at least 34 less than promised in the 
agreement on a 10day exchange covering up to 1570 prisoners 
the first group of the sick and disabled pows was repatriated 
thursday both nations returned fewer prisoners than promised on 
that day too 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said that some prisoners it 
had intended to return were no longer sick or wounded some had to 
be kept back for further medical examinations and others chose not 
to be repatriated 
the official iraqi news agency said iraq repatriated just 18 
prisoners instead of the promised 41 because of the iranian action 
with the prisoners sent back thursday 103 iraqis and 37 iranians 
have been repatriated flown back aboard a plane specially chartered 
by the red cross 
before the latest round of repatriations the two sides had 
exchanged 765 iraqi sick and wounded pows and 613 iranians since 
1981 the red cross has registered 50182 iraqi pows and 19284 
iranians but the total number of pows is estimated at 100000 
iran and iraq started peace talks under united nations auspices 
five days after an aug 20 ceasefire went into effect in their 
eightyear war the talks have made no progress the agreement with 
the red cross on exchanging disabled pows signed earlier this 
month came outside the framework of the peace talks 
in iraq the head of the legal department of the foreign 
ministry akram alwitri said that iraq will continue repatriating 
iranian sick and wounded pows but insisted the exchange will be 
based on reciprocity we will send them the same proportion of the 
number they will send us he said 
he said iraq is not convinced by claims that some of the 
prisoners have opted to stay in iran or have been cured of their 
illness 
the red cross did not provide us with authentiticated papers 
that they have asked to stay in iran or not to return back home 
he said 
alwitri said it is doubtful the sick iraqi pows that iran 
claimed were cured have been treated because all were listed with 
chronic disabilities in previous reports given to iraq

authorities today exhumed the skeletons 
of two bar hostesses allegedly killed in a military coverup of the 
1983 assassination of benigno aquino the husband of president 
corazon aquino 
also today the military said the massacre this week of 17 people 
in a remote mountain village was caused in part by a dispute over a 
local cult 
the remains of the two hostesses were taken to manila for further 
tests to determine if they really are those of two sisters closely 
identified with the man originally thought to be the killer of 
former sen aquino according to officials of the national bureau of 
investigation 
aquino was shot to death on aug 21 1983 at the manila 
international airport as soldiers escorted him out of a plane that 
flew him home from three years of selfimposed exile in the united 
states 
the slaying triggered protests leading to the february 1986 
civilianmilitary uprising that toppled ferdinand marcos 20year 
regime and swept aquinos widow to power 
marcos and his military claimed aquino was killed by rolando 
galman an alleged communist agent whom soldiers shot dead at the 
airport immediately after aquino was shot 
but a civilian board that investigated the slaying concluded 
aquino was killed by one of his military escorts and that galman was 
simply used as a scapegoat it described galman as an underworld 
character who was in and out of jail because of his links to some 
military officials 
the bodies were exhumed from a sugarcane field just outside 
capas60 miles north of manila the burial pit was pinpointed by 
five militiamen who claimed unidentified military officers ordered 
them to bury the women in december 1986 
the sisters anna and catherine oliva were hostesses at a bar 
frequented by galman they disappeared in september 1986 
officials said the five unidentified militiamen also pointed to 
an area nearby as the place where they buried galmans wife lina and 
cousin rogelio taruc in january 1984 the two were last seen being 
led away from their homes by suspected soldiers wearing civilian 
clothes 
galmans daughter rosalinda said her mother told her as she was 
led away that she was being invited by gen fabian ver then the 
military chief of staff and marcos most trusted general 
prosecutor raul gonzales said all four people were silenced 
because they knew galman intimately and were aware of his ties to 
some military officers 
ver and 25 others were acquitted of murder charges in december 
1975 but a new supreme court constituted after mrs aquino came to 
power ruled the first trial was manipulated by marcos and ordered a 
new trial the number of defendants has increased to 40 most of 
them soldiers 
the military held a news conference in cebu city today to present 
nine people accused of participating in a massacre tuesday in bagtik 
village gunmen killed 17 people and wounded 12 in an attack on the 
chapel of a religious cult known as katoliko largo or straight 
catholics 
the confessed leader of the attack said a cultists refusal to 
have sex with her husband led to the massacre but the military 
insisted that communist rebels also took part in the attack 
i regret what i have done pelagio caro said when he and the 
eight other suspects were presented in cebu city 360 miles 
southeast of manila the suspects arrested friday will be charged 
with murder the military said 
the military said caro told investigators he resented his wifes 
rejection of his sexual advances after she joined the cult and 
planned to do something about it he said sex was forbidden by 
the cult unless approved by its priest gervasio sarita a man in 
his late 60s who was killed 
the military said caro and other villagers who opposed the cult 
sought the help of a commander bador of the communist new 
peoples army who provided the arms and some of men for the attack 
on the cult 
caro said the group wanted to punish only gervasio and cult 
founder and leader cresencia hermosilia who was wounded in the 
thigh caro said the group didnt intend a massacre and only fired 
when cultists pelted them with stones

president mikhail s gorbachev today convened a 
meeting of the countrys highest executive body to consider 
estonias challenge to centralized kremlin controls tass reported 
the official news agency said the presidium of the supreme soviet 
was to discuss proposed constitutional amendments that have drawn 
strong opposition in the baltic republic of estonia and other soviet 
republics gorbachev is chairman of the executive body 
the supreme soviet the national parliament is to meet tuesday 
to consider amendments that would establish a council of peoples 
deputies which would elect a legislature and a president with 
enhanced powers 
on nov 16 estonias supreme soviet denounced the changes that 
would centralize power and passed a declaration of sovereignty 
in all areas but defense and foreign policy it also approved an 
amendment to the republics constitution requiring estonian approval 
of all new soviet laws 
official radio moscow said todays session will consider the 
constitutionality of estonias action 
on nov 19 two national parliamentary commissions found the 
declarations to be at odds with the soviet constitution and passed 
its recommendations on to the presidium 
the policymaking communist party central committee is to meet 
monday to consider the issue in preparation for the soviet supreme 
session tass said 
the constitutional amendments proposed by gorbachev face strong 
opposition not only in estonia but also in the two other baltic 
republics of latvia and lithuania 
baltic activists who are pushing for greater political cultural 
and economic autonomy under the banner of gorbachevs reforms say 
the constitutional amendments would take away some of their power 
rather than grant them greater local control 
activists in the southern republics of georgia and armenia say 
the legislatures there also have rejected the amendments 
the kremlin has expressed a willingness to compromise on the 
issue 
earlier this week a legislative panel recommended that the 
proposed council of peoples deputies not be given power to throw 
out laws adopted by the republics on thursday the ruling communist 
party politburo noted that the bills could be substantially 
improved 
radio moscow said the presidium received 200000 letters about 
the amendments it said most exprssed approval but many suggested 
changes 
as a result many provisions have been improved radio moscow 
said

radical groups which have little public backing have been 
trying to use the chun issue to generate opposition to the roh 
government onlookers showed few signs of support for the radicals 
saturday and the march appeared smaller than protests last week 
roh appealed on television for an end to the crisis surrounding 
chun and asked for mercy for the former president who went into 
internal exile wednesday after apologizing for corruption and other 
abuses under his government 
chun a former general who stepped down in february after a 
sevenyear term said he was surrendering all his property 
including about 24 million but he has denied any personal 
corruption 
roh also an exgeneral and former ally of chun promised to 
correct past government abuses and shake up the administration to 
remove vestiges of the chun era 
i will liquidate past wrongdoings and carry out bold reforms in 
the government and governing party in the quest of a new era he 
said 
roh stopped short of granting chun a pardon but said any 
prosecution of the former ruler would be unfair political 
retribution 
when he himself apologized deeply how can we stone the former 
president alone on the grounds that there were many mistakes in the 
past roh said 
opposition parties immediately rejected rohs appeal saying chun 
should be investigated by the national assembly and a special 
prosecutor radical groups called for rohs removal from office and 
some demanded chun commit suicide 
chun doohwan is a coward who asks for forgiveness instead of 
taking his own life to atone for his crimes dissident leader paik 
kiwan told a rally 
paik urged people to march on the blue house presidential 
mansion riot police dressed in green combat fatigues and black 
visored helmets blocked the way students hurled scores of 
firebombs and rocks before being driven off by police armored vans 
firing volleys of tear gas 
protesters burned an effigy draped in the us flag speakers 
said roh and chun were american puppets and demanded an end to us 
ties 
drive out yankees protesters chanted 
small peaceful antichun protests were also reported in the 
provincial cities of pusan chunchon taegu taejon and andong 
roh said he will grant amnesty to political prisoners jailed 
under chun who took power in 1980 with military backing roh also 
promised to restore the civil rights of prisoners already freed 
government officials said the cases of 266 prisoners convicted of 
political offenses or facing trial were being reviewed and many 
would be freed around dec 10 opposition parties contend there are 
about 1000 political prisoners 
roh also promised compensation for victims of the 1980 uprising 
in the southern city of kwangju and other people killed or dismissed 
for political reasons under chun about 200 people died when the 
army suppressed the uprising

if there is a battlefront in el 
salvadors unconventional civil war it runs through this 
successively bombedout deserted and revived town 
tenancingo has become a symbol of neutralism and a model for 
broader resolution of nine years of strife that has claimed an 
estmated 65000 lives 
an experimental european economic community program has funded 
more than 200000 and spent three years trying to revive the town 
but as one phase of the program ends next month tenancingos 
political direction and economic survival remain an object of 
speculation and contention 
im afraid admitted mayor blanca paz vasquez who was 
abducted by rebels earlier this year 
in 1983 the tenancingo area was one of the most embattled 
sectors in the country that september the guerrillas took the town 
the air force bombed and strafed tenancingo for several hours 
killing at least 50 people and destroying 60 percent of the town 
its nearly 10000 people mostly peasant farmers fled 
with the backing of fundasal the europeanfunded private 
foundation about 2000 residents returned in february 1986 nearly 
1000 have joined them since 
as part of the return the usbacked government and the 
farabundo marti national liberation front reached an unprecedented 
churchmediated accord under which neither side would establish a 
permanent presence in or near the town 
the objective was to ensure tenancingos neutrality to allow it 
to rebuild and prosper 
fundasal oversaw the election of local authorities and with 
them has run the towns services and administration 
the power lines are back up drinking water runs into homes and 
the few shops many tileroofed onestory buildings lining the 
cobbled streets have been painted though most still exhibit 
pockmarks from bullets and sharpnel 
mrs paz vasquez who in may became the towns first mayor since 
1983 is the focus of a dispute that has divided the nearly 3000 
residents she recognizes the work the foundation has done but says 
the foundations community council no longer has a reason to exist 
she alleged that it maintains an alliance with the insurgents 
she claimed its supporters spread false rumors such as her 
purported intention to lobby for establishment of a permanent 
military presence in town 
danilo cabrera the local director of fundasal rejects the 
charges he accused the mayor of arrogance and inability to work out 
a smooth transition and acknowledges that the accord is eroding 
daily 
army troops regularly patrol the towns outskirts though they do 
not usually enter on wednesday about 30 government soldiers walked 
through downtown or sat in the treeshaded central plaza 
the previous night guerrillas entered to buy bread fruit and 
vegetables neither sides fighters spend the night and clashes 
around the town have been rare and brief 
the townspeoples hearts and minds are the new battlefield 
the soldiers wore black baseballstyle caps with the word 
opsic psychological operations across the front they were 
inviting the people to a gathering where the military would 
distribute medicine seed and clothing 
since february the guerrillas also have entered town with 
increasing frequency to distribute leaflets and talk to residents 
the rebels abducted mrs paz vasquez three days after she took 
office may 1 and presented her to comandante ramiro she and 
ramiro came to an agreement under which she would be allowed to 
continue in office 
he accompanied me back to the town and called a meeting in the 
square he said i would be allowed to work because i genuinely 
wanted to help the people said the 33yearold mayor 
the guerrilla front forbids mayoralties in areas it deems zones 
of control the guerrillas have assassinated five mayors during 
the past two years 
in june another guerrilla chief visited the mayor ordering her 
to close her office and leave town in july the rebels distributed 
leaflets saying they have nothing against any honest individual 
but that once such a person takes up a government post they become 
an enemy 
during a midday interview they mayors secretary stuck her head 
through the office door and said here they come 
the mayor blanched repeating incredulously theyre coming 
no no its not that the secretary assure her friends were 
coming for lunch 
in august the mayor moved with her five children to san 
salvador and now commutes nearly three hours each way from the 
capital 
i dont know how much longer i can keep this up she said 
if they give me a final warning i guess ill just pack up and 
move the office 
despite the feuding between the town leaders and fundasal 
everyone interviewed expressed the desire to maintain tenancingos 
neutrality 
mercedes franco a 28yearold farmworker said seeing either 
soldiers or guerrillas in town makes us afraid because were the 
ones who get caught in between

robert carlyle byrd former butcher grocer and 
shipyard welder quietly relinquishes one of the most powerful 
elective offices in the nation this week 
byrd is stepping down as majority leader of the senate the 15th 
person to hold that position he leaves confident he has revitalized 
the senates role in american government but doubtful his successor 
can stem growing complaints that life in the chamber isnt what it 
should be 
tempered by poverty in the west virginia coal fields where he was 
raised early in the century byrd who turned 71 last week has 
little sympathy for the complaints of younger men who see the senate 
as a cumbersome body that works too late too often 
we cant operate on a punchtheclock basis says byrd who 
was elected to his sixth 6year term on election day i did that 
once when i was a welder in a shipyard 
his successor as leader of the senate will be elected tuesday 
when the 55 democratic senators of the 101st congress gather for an 
organizational meeting in the capitol 
the majority leader a position formally recognized in 1911 
controls the senates schedule including which bills are considered 
and when they are debated 
for the first time since his election as majority whip in 1971 
byrd wont be running for a leadership role but he wont be without 
power as he assumes the chairmanship of the senate appropriations 
committee and becomes president pro tempore the senior statesman 
of the senate that also puts him third in line for the presidency 
behind the vice president and the speaker of the house of 
representatives 
i look back on my years as leader with satisfaction the 
silverhaired senator said in an interview in his capitol office 
suite last week he has served as leader of his party in the senate 
since 1976 half that time as majority leader 
i have brought the senate back to where it is now a stronger 
voice than it had been for a while byrd said i have insisted 
on checks and balances with the executive branch to make it a potent 
and strong force 
in explaining how he revitalized the senates unique role 
byrd refers to the senates exhaustive work in approving president 
reagans missile treaty with the soviet union and its rejection of 
robert bork and subsequent approval of anthony kennedy for the 
supreme court 
looking ahead byrd is skeptical about the election promises of 
those seeking to replace him as majority leader 
i dont intend to offer advice byrd says theyre all 
three capable and expert on legislation and each has his own special 
talents 
the three daniel inouye of hawaii bennett johnston of louisiana 
and george mitchell of maine each are promising to improve the 
quality of life in the senate by quality of life they mean 
to shorten a grueling regime of long hours and unpredictable 
schedules 
i believe first in the quality of work byrd said one 
cant adjust the needs of the nation to ones comfort 
he believes the task facing his replacement and congress in 
general is daunting 
the hangover will soon be felt byrd said of the budget 
deficit and national debt crises facing the bush administration and 
the democraticcontrolled 101st congress 
weve got a very terrible problem that will be overriding 
byrd says congress will work with mr bush but he has to show 
leadership 
he comes to the presidency a more knowledgable man with a 
respect for the federal government byrd says of the 
presidentelect 
byrd grimaces at the mention of the outgoing administration and 
offers two observations of ronald reagan who he has criticized 
often for his confrontational approach to the congress 
one hes a very charming and likable man second hes going 
to leave a legacy our children and grandchildren will pay for a 
national debt we were the worlds greatest creditor eight years 
ago now were the worlds biggest debtor nation 
looking back to before reagan came on the washington scene and 
to his own beginnings in congress byrd says he holds two former 
presidents in highest regard 
my favorite democratic president was truman i served under him 
for 17 days byrd says referring to the brief transition period 
when he was taking his seat in the house of representatives in 1953 
and harry truman was turning the white house over to dwight 
eisenhower 
the republican president he holds in highest regard was richard 
m nixon a man he describes as very very able equipped to be 
president he understood government and he knew how to work with 
congress 
byrd puts his retirement as majority leader in historic 
perspective 
a man who often takes to the senate floor to quote poetry and 
read history byrd says he is retiring like cincinnatus the 5th 
century bc roman farmerstatesman who twice left his fields to 
save rome in crisis only to return to the farm 
byrd isnt returning to any farm but he says with a smile 
like cincinnatus im going back to the plow

soldiers shot to death three azerbaijanis for 
violating a curfew in the city of kirovabad raising the death toll 
from ethnic violence in the city this week to six an official said 
today 
chingiz sadykhov officer in charge of the azerbaijani citys 
communist party headquarters said in a telephone interview that the 
three were shot friday for violating a strict overnight curfew 
imposed to quell disturbances between azerbaijanis and armenians in 
the southern soviet union 
soldiers in tanks and personnel carriers continued to patrol the 
streets even though there had been no protests for the past two 
days he said 
three soldiers were killed in kirovabad on tuesday after being 
called in to protect the citys armenian population from mobs of 
azerbaijanis 
the defense ministry newspaper krasnaya zvezda said today they 
were killed by a hand grenade thrown from a crowd 
sadykhov said about 120 people had been injured in the unrest 
protests ground to a halt today in the capital of armenia under a 
ban imposed by soldiers who were reported to be on nearly every 
street corner and breaking up gatherings of even two or three people 
there are soldiers patrolling everywhere especially in the 
center of the city said arpenay popoyan wife of activist rafael 
popoyan in a telephone interview from the armenian capital yerevan 
if two or three people gather the soldiers come and break them 
up she said the patrols are very strict 
mrs popoyan and correspondent yuri kankanyan of the official 
armenian news agency armenpress said there were no protests or 
meetings which were banned by the military commandant under an 
order establishing an overnight curfew 
most public transportation and stores were open and no 
excesses are evident said kankanyan 
musa mamedov information director for the azerbaijani foreign 
ministry in baku said in a telephone interview that demonstrations 
continued in baku but that there was no violence 
official radio moscow said the situation was relatively calm 
despite attempts to provoke riots in several areas 
it said transport and shops were operating there as well a 
curfew remained in effect in baku 
kankanyan said 500 armenians mostly women and children had 
arrived in yerevan from the azerbaijani region of nakhichevan a 
small enclave situated between iran and armenia but that armenians 
were waiting for the first refugees to arrive from kirovabad site 
of the worst violence this week 
mamedov denied reports of much higher death tolls from the 
fighting in armenia and azerbaijan including one cited by soviet 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov who said in the united 
states that more than 130 armenians had been killed sakharov who 
did not give the source for his figures urged the soviet government 
to take measures to protect armenians 
reports of high casualty tolls are rife in the armenian community 
in yerevan and in moscow but they have not been confirmed mrs 
popoyan said activists in yerevan also could not confirm reports of 
more than 100 deaths 
mamedov said the figure of 130 included injuries and deaths 
he said the majority of those injured in kirovabad were 
azerbaijanis hurt in clashes with soldiers 
the latest fighting between armenians and azerbaijanis has 
challenged president mikhail s gorbachevs reform efforts 
gorbachev speaking in a joint interview with visiting president 
francois mitterrand of france broadcast friday night on french 
television said the unrest was part of perestroika his 
campaign to reform soviet society 
animosity between armenians who are mostly christian and 
azerbaijanis mostly moslem dates back hundreds of years in the 
caucasus region that now forms part of the soviet border with turkey 
and iran 
gorbachev said soviet leaders would meet soon with delegations of 
armenians and azerbaijanis seeking a solution that would conform 
to the best interests of these two peoples and our country 
ethnic conflict in the two caucasus republics escalated in 
february in a dispute over nagornokarabakh a territory with a 
predominantly armenian population that has been part of azerbaijan 
since 1923 
armenians held general strikes and mass demonstrations demanding 
that the territory be annexed to armenia although they do not have 
a common border but moscow did not approve it a riot feb 28 in 
the azerbaijani city of sumgait killed 32 people 26 of them 
armenians

prosecutors are proud to be compared to 
crimebusting elliot ness and his team of untouchables following 
a courtroom triumph that has gutted the leadership of organized 
crime in pennsylvania and southern new jersey 
they dont run around with machine guns and axes like ness and 
his men while fighting chicago gangsters like al capone and busting 
up monshine stills a halfcentury ago 
and says joel friedman chief of the federal organized crime 
strike force here elliot ness was more a lone ranger against the 
world and thats not exactly what we are 
but they got a lot of satisfaction from the nov 19 jury 
convictions of mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo and 16 la 
cosa nostra associates on all charges in a racketeering conspiracy 
that included nine murders four attempted murders drug dealing 
loansharking and illegal gambling 
no sentencing date has been set but scarfo and his codefendants 
all face possible sentences of 40 to 55 years in prison scarfo is 
already serving a 14year sentence for a 1987 extortion and 
conspiracy conviction 
lead prosecutor louis pichini 43 a grandson of italian 
immigrants and his colleagues enjoy it if someone wants to link 
them to ness 
it is a dream come true especially for an italianamerian 
working in organized crime everybody has a dream to run for a 
touchdown or score the winning run and this is what ive wanted 
most in 15 years as a career prosecutor he said 
this is the pinnacle pichini said i dont think we are 
ever going to get any better than this 
we told the public just like ness that the mafia and the 
mystique of the mafia is penetrable and we also sent a signal loud 
and clear to the la cosa nostra and any other other organized 
criminal group that they can and will be prosecuted said joseph 
peters chief deputy pennsylvania attorney general assigned to the 
federal unit 
whats next 
we have to see where the mob is going to go before we know we 
will go said pichini there is a vacuum a substantial hole in 
the mob left by this conviction but sooner or later the void is 
going to be filled then well go after them again 
la cosa nostra or mafia first grew in the united states near 
the end of the 19th century imported from sicily and southern italy 
by the late 1920s the gangster era was in full swing including 
the philadelphia area where until angelo bruno took control in 1959 
there were seven bosses and many gang killings 
bruno reigned until he was shot in 1980 his successor philip 
chicken man testa was assassinated by a bomb a year later 
then scarfo whom prosecutors called a paranoid coldblooded 
killer took over and more than a dozen murders followed in the 
bloody struggle for mob power 
the prosecutors were glad the jurors were protected by keeping 
their names and addresses secret 
a year earlier scarfo and other mobsters were acquitted on drug 
trafficking charges by a jury that wasnt anonymous pichini said he 
believed those jurors were a little frightened and intimidated 
not this jury he said it was an appropriate setting to 
hear all the charges proved against each defendant it came back 
with convictions for everything it was as thorough a victory as you 
could have against organized crime 
friedman 43 a native of chicago said the equilibrium has 
shifted to the publics favor because of a series of successful 
prosecutions but whether we can completely eradicate the la cosa 
nostra is up for debate 
as long as there is greed there will be organized crime he 
said i dont think we will ever have sufficient resources to 
bring organized crime down to zero

cooperation among latin caribbean and us 
officials even those at odds politically kept the loss of life 
to probably onetenth of what it might have been during this 
years hurricane season the nations chief hurricane forecaster 
says 
the sixmonth atlantic hurricane season which officially ends 
wednesday produced 11 named storms and six hurricanes including 
the recordbreaking gilbert and tropical storm keith which blew 
across florida last week but caused little damage except beach 
erosion and minor flooding forecasters called it an average storm 
season 
there were 505 deaths recorded this year but in the past major 
hurricanes have killed thousands when they hit latin and caribbean 
nations where many houses are unable to stand up to hurricane winds 
and flooding said bob sheets director of the national hurricane 
center in nearby coral gables 
im pleased to say i think everything went very well sheets 
said even with the destruction were talking about loss of life 
was relatively small the governments i think did an excellent job 
in getting their people prepared 
during the rise of hurricane joan last month for example the 
center was in constant contact with the nicaraguan embassy in 
washington and the colombian meteorological service sheets said 
forecasters spoke regularly with concerned parties in panama and 
costa rica 
during joan sheets said costa rican president oscar arias 
himself called four times here to this office a week after the 
storm he sent his vice president to visit and thank employees for 
their help 
i know there are political differences that exist between the 
us nicaragua and cuba sheets said but those differences 
arent felt in the meteorological community 
the sharing of information helped governments order evacuations 
and take necessary precautions sheets said 
sheets recalled that hurricane fifi a 1974 storm that struck 
honduras killed 8000 people by contrast 184 people died as a 
result of hurricane joans encounter with central america 
hal gerrish another hurricane center forecaster said the 
international cooperation has been fostered by workshops the 
hurricane center has held for at least the past six years for 
officials from other nations 
we have a 10day course in both spanish and english for the 
caribbean forecasters gerrish said saturday their lead 
forecasters will come up for refreshers and to get the latest on 
forecasting this has created a pretty close fraternity among us 
this years season produced a record hurricane gilbert there 
was talk of adding a new top rank to the saffirsimpson scale a 
sort of richter scale for hurricanes just to accommodate it sheets 
said 
he added that gilbert will probably be recorded as one of the 
costliest storms ever gil clark of the hurricane center said 
figures are still preliminary but he estimated the september storm 
did 1 billion to 2 billion worth of damage primarily in jamaica 
and mexico 
sheets noted that gilbert was the lowest pressure ever recorded 
in this hemisphere as a rule the lower a hurricanes barometric 
pressure the stronger its winds gilbert registered sustained winds 
as high as 175 mph 
sheets compared gilbert to the 1935 hurricane that hit the 
florida keys killing more than 400 people its winds were clocked 
at up to 200 mph its pressure was the lowest recorded in the 
hemisphere before gilbert 
gilbert also was one of the largest hurricanes weve ever 
seen sheets said 
the storms eye measured 8 miles across at one point he said 
gilbert stretched across the florida keys cuba the florida 
straits all of the western caribbean and part of the gulf of 
mexico it killed more than 300 people and did significant damage in 
mexico jamaica haiti and the dominican republic 
while gilbert was ranked a 5 on the saffirsimpson scale the 
scales top rank joan rated a 4 
sheets said that in the century the service has kept records 
there has been no mention of a category 4 storm in central america 
joan menaced central america for days before blasting it with top 
winds of 135 mph causing mudslides floods and other damage in 
nicaragua costa rica colombia and panama 
even after crossing land joan had sufficient strength to be 
renamed miriam as a pacific storm 
there are a lot of mysteries associated with hurricanes and the 
seasons two biggest storms which followed unusual paths for major 
hurricanes only added to them 
as far as understanding why we have a gilbert or a joan indeed 
we know what are the necessary conditions but we dont know what 
the trigger mechanisms are sheets said

rule in the province 
social democratic and labor party leader john hume called on the 
irish republican army to put down guns and bombs and try to work for 
talks to heal differences in the region 
if they were to do so then the atmosphere in this whole island 
would be transformed and the nightmare of all our people would 
be truly at an end said hume whose party also wants to end 
british rule peacefully and unite the mainly protestant province 
with the irish republic 
the iras choice of violence showed extreme moral cowardice and 
a deeply partitionist attitude hume said at the opening of an 
annual party conference in their minds it is blood that is the 
essential qualification for a patriot not sweat 
he said the ira had killed more than twice as many catholics as 
their real targets the security forces but did not give figures 
talks on northern irelands future between his party and sinn 
fein the legal political wing of the ira broke down in september 
humes party blamed the impasse on sinn feins refusal to renounce 
ira violence

militants shot and stabbed passengers 
aboard a bus and fired on troops rushing to the scene saturday 
killing six people and prompting a weekend curfew news reports said 
the curfew banned civilian movement on the streets around colombo 
from saturday night until monday morning 
it followed the attack in pannipitiya a suburban neighborhood 
four miles southeast of the capital said lankapuwath the national 
news agency 
the news agency said the militants suspected sinhalese 
extremists launched the attack after boarding the bus 
a woman passenger died after being injured in the gunfire news 
reports said three soldiers were killed aboard the bus and two 
others died when they approached the bus after hearing the gunfire 
lankapuwath said the militants then fled

outskirts after a series of strike calls by the peoples liberation 
front a militant sinhalese group earlier this month 
the front stepped up its 16month antigovernment campaign 
earlier this month demanding the resignation of president junius r 
jayewardene 
the front opposes an indiasponsored peace plan signed by the 
government that was aimed at ending the 5yearold war by minority 
tamil rebels for an independent homeland 
the sinhalese group says the july 1987 plan gives too many 
concessions to the minority tamils the front has been blamed by the 
government for about 875 killings since the plan was signed 
at least 325 of the killings have taken place since oct 15 the 
government says 
india became involved in the ethnic strife in sri lanka because 
of the sympathies of its own 60 million tamils for the rebel cause 
it sent in at least 47000 soldiers to quell the tamil insurgency 
after the rebels rejected the 1987 peace accord 
tamil rebels have been fighting for an independent homeland on

a new opec production agreement hinged 
saturday on whether irans oil minister could persuade his 
government to approve it 
iraqs oil minister issam abdul raheem chalabi crossed his 
fingers when reporters asked him to describe the prospects of the 
accord worked out by the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
gholamreza aghazadeh the iranian official made a quick trip to 
tehran to consult with government leaders before accepting the 
package 
he is still optimistic said an iranian delegate who was in 
contact with aghazadeh on saturday morning the delegate demanded 
anonymity 
the other oil ministers postponed resumption of their winter 
meeting from saturday evening to sunday to give iran time to 
consider the plan 
irna the official islamic republic news agency reported from 
tehran that aghazadeh said the nations response will be announced 
sunday 
the news agency quoted the minister as saying he would talk 
saturday to the heads of the executive legislative and judiciary 
branches of government the report said he would discuss the matter 
in a cabinet session sunday 
then we will inform opec of irans decision he was quoted as 
saying 
the proposed deal would trim current production by about 4 
million barrels a day from the present 225 million barrels to 185 
million barrels in the first six months of 1989 
it also would retain the cartels benchmark of 18 a barrel 
prices have been running 4 or so below that because of a market 
glut the new accord is aimed at curbing overproduction and raising 
prices 
irna quoted aghazadeh as saying the new production ceiling would 
boost prices to a range of 16 to 18 a barrel 
each one dollar rise in the price of crude oil theoretically 
means an increase of 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices 
although oil companies do not always pass along the full increase 
the ministers began their winter meeting monday then adjourned 
for closeddoor talks to try to end a bitter dispute between rivals 
iran and iraq the two nations signed a ceasefire in august that 
ended their 8yearold war a conflict both paid for with revenues 
from oil exports 
iraq had been demanding an equal production ceiling with iran in 
any new accord aghazadeh had repeatedly said no 
but under the new accord iran and iraq would get the same quota 
of 264 million barrels a day 
iran would retain its production share at 1427 percent of total 
output other countries would give up some of their share to bring 
iraq up to the same level as iran 
saudi arabia maintains the largest share at about a quarter of 
the cartels total output 
under the current accord iran has a cap of 24 million barrels a 
day iraq was given a ceiling of 15 million barrels butignored it 
analysts estimate its production at 27 million barrels a day 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates 
and venezuela

here is the text of president 
reagans weekly radio address given from his ranch in the santa ynze 
mountains near here 
my fellow americans this week as we prepared for thanksgiving 
canada held an important election and im pleased to again send my 
congratulations to prime minister mulroney 
one of the important issues in the canadian election was trade 
and like our own citizens earler this month our neighbors have sent 
a strong message rejecting protectionism and reaffirming that more 
trade not less is the wave of the future 
here in america as we reflect on the many things we have to be 
grateful for we should take a moment to recognize that one of the 
key factors behind our nations great prosperity is the open trade 
policy that allows the american people to freely exchange goods and 
services with free people around the world 
the freedom to trade is not a new issue for america in 1776 our 
founding fathers signed the declaration of independence charging the 
british with a number of offenses among them and i quote 
cutting off our trade with all parts of the world 
in that same year a scottish economist named adam smith launched 
another revolution with a book entitled the wealth of nations 
which exposed for all time the folly of protectionism 
over the past 200 years not only has the argument against 
tariffs and trade barriers won nearly universal agreement among 
economists but it has also proven itself in the real world where we 
have seen free trading nations prosper while protectionist 
countries fall behind 
americas most recent experiment with protectionism was a 
disaster for the working men and women of this country when 
congress passed the smoothawley tariff in 1930 we were told that 
it would protect america from foreign competition and save jobs in 
this country the same line we hear today 
the actual result was the great depression the worst economic 
catastrophe in our history one out of four americans were thrown 
out of work two years later when i cast my first ballot for 
president i voted for franklin delano roosevelt who opposed 
protectionism and called for the repeal of that disastrous tariff 
ever since that time the american people have stayed true to our 
heritage by rejecting the siren song of protectionism in recent 
years the trade deficit led some misguided politicians to call for 
protectionism warning that otherwise we would lose jobs but they 
were wrong again in fact the united states not only didnt lose 
jobs we created more jobs than all the countries of western europe 
canada and japan combined 
the record is clear that when americas total trade is increased 
american jobs have also increased and when our total trade has 
declined so have the number of jobs part of the difficulty in 
accepting the good news about trade is in our words we too often 
talk about trade while using the vocabulary of war in war for one 
side to win the other must lose but commerce is not warfare trade 
is an economic alliance that benefits both countries there are no 
losers only winners and trade helps strengthen the free world 
yet today protectionism is being used by some american 
politicians as a cheap form of nationalism a fig leaf for those 
unwilling to maintain americas military strength and who lack the 
resolve to stand up to real enemies countries that would use 
violence against us or our allies 
our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies they are our 
allies we should beware of the demagogues who are ready to declare 
a trade war against our friends weakening our economy on national 
security and the entire free world all while cynically waving the 
american flag 
the expansion of the international economy is not a foreign 
invasion it is an american triumph one we worked hard to achieve 
and something central to our vision of a peaceful and prosperous 
world of freedom after the second world war america led the way to 
dismantle trade barriers and create a world trading system that set 
the stage for decades of unparalleled economic growth and in one 
week when important multilateral trade talks are held in montreal 
we will be in the forefront of efforts to improve this system 
we want to open more markets for our products to see to it that 
all nations play by the rules and to seek improvement in such areas 
as dispute resolution and agriculture we also want to bring the 
benefits of free trade to new areas including services investment 
and the protection of intellectual property our negotiators will be 
working hard for all of us 
yes back in 1776 our founding fathers believed that free trade 
was worth fighting for and we can celebrate their victory because 
today trade is at the core of the alliances that secure the peace 
and guarantee our freedom it is the source of our prosperity and 
the path to an even brighter future for america 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

a team of soviet and french astronauts blasted off 
from central asia on saturday and headed for the soviets orbiting 
space station mir 
the three cosmonauts aboard the soyuz tm7 were scheduled to 
rendezvous aboard the mir with three men already in orbit for what 
tass called the first practical preparations of an international 
team for a manned expedition to mars 
french president francois mitterrand wearing a coat and scarf 
peered through binoculars from a viewing stand at the baikonur 
cosmodrome as the rocket lifted off in the darkness 
also present at the launch were two members of the british rock 
group pink floyd a favorite of french astronaut jeanloup chretien 
the launch was carried live by soviet and french national 
television 
an hour after takeoff the soviet space center said all systems 
were operating normally 
chretien is to remain aboard the mir until dec 21 when he is 
scheduled to return to earth with two soviet cosmonauts who will 
have spent 365 days in orbit 
with him in the launch vehicle were mission commander alexander 
volkov and flight engineer sergei krikalev who are expected to 
spend about six months in space 
soviet television showed the cosmonauts in their space capsule 
before the launch and apparently during the initial ascent 
volkov said in a prepared statement he read minutes before launch 
that all equipment on board was in order 
chretien expressed his pride at being included as his countrys 
representative on the flight and told mitterrand he appreciated the 
socialist presidents presence at the launch 
chretien a music lover took with him a portable organ to play 
aboard the mir space station 
it will be interesting to see how a man can accomplish delicate 
tasks in weightlessness and music is delicate said patrick 
baudry who flew on a us space shuttle mission in 1985 baudry was 
interviewed on french television 
because chretien told a recent news conference that he liked the 
rock group pink floyd the crew was carrying one of the groups 
albums into space and two members of the band watched the launch at 
baikonur 
during his mission chretien is to become the first west european 
to make a walk in space 
he is also planning to carry out scientific experiments prepared 
by experts at frances national center for space studies 
mitterrand and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev met saturday 
morning in moscow for a final round of talks before the french 
president left for the launch site 
in his first meetings with gorbachev on friday mitterrand and 
the soviet leader talked about disarmament and improving economic 
ties according to soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov and mitterrand spokesman hubert vedrine 
france has harshly criticized the soviet union in the past for 
alleged human rights violations but its spokesman refrained from 
commenting on that issue at fridays news briefing 
officials also announced that french banks led by credit lyonnais 
are extending a 2 billion credit line to the soviet union 
the soviets also signed a joint venture agreement with the french 
governmentowned pechiney sa metals group to build a 1724 million 
factory in armenia for manufacturing aluminum packaging

cosmonauts aboard the soviet space station are 
dining on compote of pigeon and oxtail fondue after the french made 
their most sumptuous effort to put haute cuisine into outer space 
only wine and those famous french sauces which would float away 
in the gravityfree atmosphere are missing from the menu 
twentythree products ranging from bread rolls to ham and fruit 
pates are stocked aboard the soyuztm7 space module which blasted 
off saturday from the baikonur cosmodrome in soviet central asia 
the spacecraft is headed for the mir space station where five 
soviet cosmonauts and french astronaut jeanloup chretien will live 
until dec 21 
we looked for difficult things to make things that are out of 
the ordinary that give some pleasure said chef lucien vanel who 
prepared four gourmet dishes for the astronauts 
vanels creations made with the help of chef pierre roudge 
include compote of pigeon with dates and dried raisins duck with 
artichokes and oxtail fondue with tomatoes and pickles the food is 
all canned to be opened like you open fois gras vanel said 
this is not food to be eaten every day the chef said its 
not to survive on just to give them a little pleasure 
but he said he regretted a good bottle of wine could not make the 
journey into space 
french cuisine is inconceivable without wine he said 
saute de veau marengo and cheeses also are making the trip along 
with highenergy bars made of nuts coffee and chocolate 
the project was sponsored by several french food companies 
the chefs worked under three limitations the dishes had to be 
small and contain neither bones nor sauce 
sauce would be transformed into flying droplets vanel said so 
the meat was made to absorb the sauce during cooking 
this is not the first time french cuisine has gone into orbit in 
1982 chretien shared his countrys dishes with soviet colleagues in 
space and in 1985 french astronaut patrick baudry treated fellow 
astronauts aboard the us shuttle discovery to a meal a la 
francaise 
vanel said his dishes closely resemble those prepared in his 
toulouse restaurant only here at the restaurant we serve the 
entire pigeon 
in a couple years well see sauce and bones and wine go up 
there

threequarters since 1981 advocates say the need for lasting 
shelter is critical some see potential in unused governmentowned 
houses and in the shells of oncesturdy buildings that stand vacant 
in inner cities

taxpayers around the nation own tens of thousands of houses 
standing empty at the same time tens of thousands of american 
families with nowhere to live overflow shelters and haunt the 
streets 
now the homeless and some of the publicly owned vacant homes are 
being brought together in a project that is housing families from 
the minnesota cold in a clandestine effort to renovate and occupy a 
dwelling in chicago in new york citys restoration of entire 
tumbledown blocks 
activists while encouraged are pressing housing officials to do 
more and a major decision could come in federal court next week 
they say the government is skirting a law that pledges available 
space to those without homes 
i think thousands of buildings could and should be usable 
said robert hayes counsel for the national coalition for the 
homeless in new york a city that owns mostly through tax default 
5000 empty apartment buildings with many times that number of 
apartments and has an estimated 60000 homeless people 
one of the abandoned buildings was on leggett street in a sorry 
corner of the south bronx a national symbol of blight 
one of the homeless was susan thomas placed in a shabby welfare 
hotel room in manhattan a few years ago with her two sons then 6 
months and 2 years old after she split from their father and ended 
up on the street 
i used to cry cause i didnt want to be there she says 
their hotel room was broken into and drug dealing and fear were all 
around 
after 18 months she boarded a city van for leggett street to 
look at an apartment in a building that had been restored 
i wasnt expecting anything like this the 24yearold woman 
said talking to a reporter in her tidy bright twobedroom 
apartment her boys playing across a room thats still mostly bare 
of furnishings it was ms thomas day off shes a clerk in a 
nearby store 
her building whose tiled entrance foyer smelled of cleaning 
fluid had been a ruin not long before 
another bronx site still is but not for long workers there are 
gutting five buildings that occupy a whole block to create 220 
apartments for families like the thomases 
vince campisi construction supervisor outgrowled the demolition 
equipment as he described getting started you literally couldnt 
get in for the junkies crack vials by the garbagepailful 
leading a reporter on a tour campisi crunched up rubblestrewn 
steps to the remains of what a parlor its ceiling was burned 
through to the sky a green upholstered sofa stood upended in a 
corner the windows let in a drizzle no airconditioning 
needed he deadpanned 
still he and others said fixing up buildings that landlords have 
abandoned is often cheaper than new construction in places like new 
york the guttingandrehab job that campisi is overseeing is to 
cost the city 15 million how much would comparable new buildings 
cost maybe 50 million he guessed 
halfway across the country in minnesota the vacant publicly 
owned houses being readied for the homeless look different

department of housing and urban development when its owners failed

patricia mack of the hud office in minneapolis which hopes by next 
spring to lease 15 houses rentfree to nonprofit groups that house 
the homeless 
such efforts have strong support according to a survey earlier 
this year by the national housing institute a nonprofit think tank 
based in orange nj one thousand adults were surveyed by phone 
eight in 10 favored rehabilitating old and vacant buildings for 
homeless americans who number 450000 to 3 million estimated by 
the government and advocacy groups respectively sixty percent said 
theyd willingly pay an extra 120 apiece in taxes each year to 
expand housing efforts 
the need for permanent housing cannot be met says a 
september report by the national coalition for the homeless without 
an increase in the federal budget for lowincome housing 7538 
billion this year down 77 percent from 1981s budget of 322 
billion

the kitchen where tainted food was 
cooked passed an inspection for cleanliness saturday as 
investigators tried to learn why one person died and nearly 100 
others became ill after a prethanksgiving dinner 
the plant was clean there were no violations said dr anita 
curran westchester county health commissioner 
hopefully well have an answer by the end of the weekend to 
what the possible problem was whether the turkeys were held at an 
inappropriate temperature or whether something else went wrong 
she said 
about 100 patients and staff members from the rockland 
psychiatric center in orangeburg became ill after eating the meal 
wednesday at outpatient facilities in mount vernon yonkers and 
tuckahoe 
ina duncan 61 of mount vernon died early friday at mount vernon 
hospital after suffering food poisoning symptoms including vomiting 
and diarrhea she also suffered a heart attack but it was not 
immediately clear whether that was brought on by food poisoning 
said nancy mcpartlin a health department spokeswoman 
another victim whose name was not released was in stable 
condition in the intensive care unit at mount vernon hospital on 
saturday said curran 
the meals were delivered after being cooked in a kitchen at iona 
college by a caterer flik international of mamaroneck 
more than two dozen iona students ate leftovers from the meal 
before leaving the campus for the holiday weekend officials didnt 
know who they were and officials said none of them of them had 
contacted the department by midday saturday 
although the cause of the food poisoning was not immediately 
identified turkey is obviously the first thing you would 
suspect curran said poultry is a very very common source of 
salmonella 
while proper cooking destroys the bacteria food service workers 
who handle a lot of poultry can carry salmonella in their intestinal 
tracts and can transmit it to food if they dont wash their hands

he was a longtime member of the anc but broke from the 
organization in 1959 to help establish the pan africanist congress 
which favors black selfsufficiency in the struggle for political 
rights

series of moves by the government that appear aimed at reducing 
domestic and international pressure on south africa in the past

endorsed a regional peace plan that would require south africa 
to grant independence to southwest africa also known as namibia 
granted clemency to the sharpville six a group of blacks

as george bush focused on his national security 
team jobseekers eyed the remaining top positions with some 
speculating the presidentelect would soon turn his attention to 
vacancies at commerce and health and human services 
john sununu bushs designated white house chief of staff said 
in an interview broadcast saturday i think next week youll see 
action in a couple of areas associated with defense 
aides at bushs transition office did not have a schedule for 
when the presidentelect would make his next appointments bush 
returns to the nations capital sunday after a thanksgiving vacation 
at kennebunkport maine 
sununu appearing on cnns evans amp novak show also said he 
has asked robert m teeter codirector of bushs transition office 
to serve as his deputy chief of staff hes considering it and 
i would hope that he says yes said sununu 
teeters codirector craig fuller has been asked to make 
suggestions as to how he can make a contribution in the bush 
administration said sununu the retiring governor of new hampshire 
while there has been talk that fuller might head the 
transportation department sununu said fuller probably has a 
higher likelihood of not being in the administration 
after fuller lost out to sununu in the competition to become 
chief of staff he said he would return to private business next 
year 
teeter was out of town and could not be reached his office 
assistant said she did not know whether he had reached any decision 
on sununus offer 
there has been widespread speculation that former sen john tower 
of texas is the frontrunner to become the pentagon chief despite 
questions about his personal life and his commitment to procurement 
reform tower was divorced from his wife last year 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass a member of the house armed 
services committee and a supporter of eliminating pentagon waste 
recalled tower as strident in the senate tower chaired the 
senate armed services committee during the massive defense buildup 
in the early years of the reagan administration 
bushs choice must be someone dedicated to cleaning up that 
mess at the pentagon mavroules said in an interview 
before he left for the thanksgiving holiday last week bush named 
retired air force gen brent scowcroft as his national security 
adviser there is some thinking that bush may keep cia director 
william webster on the job in an interim appointment 
once he fixes his national security team bush is likely to set 
his sights on two other big agencies commerce and hhs according to 
one source close to the transition the source spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
bushs aides have said there is no set timetable for having a 
government in place we have about 60 days between now and 
inauguration and i think the vice president is wise to use as much 
of that clock to his own benefit sununu said 
at commerce robert mosbacher a houston oilman and bushs old 
friend is thought to have the edge over the other candidates if 
both he and tower are picked bush would have at least four texans 
in highranking jobs others are james a baker iii the designated 
secretary of state and lauro cavazos the education secretary 
here is the scuttlebutt on some other agencies 
hhs rep willis d gradison jr rohio has emerged as a 
leading candidate to head the huge federal agency that runs the 
costly medicare and medicaid health insurance programs as well as 
social security the food and drug administration and the national 
institutes of health 
gradison a classmate of bushs at yale is ranking republican on 
the ways and means health subcommittee that deals with medicare an 
80 billion program expected to expand at more than double the rate 
of overall inflation over the next few years without spending cuts 
another serious candidate is monroe trout who runs a chain of 
nonprofit hospitals in california and serves with barbara bush on 
the board of directors of morehouse college a black institution in 
atlanta a physician and lawyer he headed a major pharmaceutical 
company and was active in republican politics in connecticut before 
moving to california and has been in washington this month talking 
with various people about his interest in the job 
among other names bandied about the the job are rep lynn martin 
rill surgeon general c everett koop and dorcas hardy the social 
security commissioner 
labor a name that has been given serious attention recently is 
that of constance horner head of the office of personnel 
management martin is another candidate for this job as is rep 
thomas ridge rpa 
energy former rep henson moore of louisiana says he is under 
consideration for this job from the best we can tell its 
getting serious he said in an interview another possible 
candidate if frederick khedouri a former aide to bush sen james 
mcclure a republican on the energy and natural resources committee 
is publicly backing peter johnson a former administrator at the 
bonneville power administration for the job 
interior the talk is that sen dan evans rwash who is 
retiring from the senate at the end of the year is still in the 
running for this position others are rep dick cheney rwyo 
william ruckelhaus former head of the environmental protection 
agency and nathaniel reed a former assistant secretary 
transportation besides fuller others who might fit the bill 
are gov thomas kean of new jersey and rep guy molinari rny 
while jockeying continues at other places such as the 
agriculture department and the epa no frontrunners seem to have

rival shiite militiamen fought fierce 
street battles on saturday and the prosyrian forces drove the 
iranianbacked fighters out of most of west beirut police said 25 
people were killed and 54 wounded 
also saturday the international red cross began pulling out its 
swiss staff from lebanon 10 days after one of its employees was 
kidnapped in sidon 
sources at the international committee for the red cross in 
beirut said the allswiss organization will close its operation 
throughout lebanon if peter winkler head of the sidon office is 
not freed by dec 3 
the ultimatum came as fighting intensified between the rival 
militias the prosyrian amal militia drove out the fundamentalist 
hezbollah backed by iran from most of west beirut on the second 
day of street battles police reported 
weve finished them we killed all 11 hezbollahis who were 
terrorizing the whole neighborhood by sniper fire said the local 
amal commander who identified himself only as bahij 
a police spokesman said 25 people were killed and 54 wounded in 
the last 24 hours in the fighting between hezbollah or party of 
god and amal arabic for hope that raised the overall toll to 35 
dead and 74 wounded since the conflict began in beiruts southern 
slums wednesday 
the fighting moved into central city districts friday 
winkler 32 was kidnapped from his car by three unidentified 
gunmen on nov 17 no group claimed responsibility 
the sidon red cross office shut down on wednesday to protest 
winklers abduction three of its staff left saturday for geneva 
leaving about 28 in the country said the red cross sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
police believe the fatahrevolutionary council faction led by 
palestinian terrorist mastermind abu nidal carried out the 
kidnapping on behalf of hezbollah which has no presence in sidon 
abu nidals organization has claimed responsibility for scores of 
terrorist attacks including those at rome and vienna airports in 
december 1985 
the fatahrevolutionary council has long been allied with 
hezbollah which is believed to be the umbrella for fundamentalist 
shiite factions holding most of the foreign hostages including nine 
americans 
in sidon a southern port city lebanese and foreign humanitarian 
organizations went on strike saturday to protest winklers abduction 
and the apparent kidnapping of belgian doctor jan cools 
cools 32 disappeared may 21 after leaving his apartment in a 
palestinian refugee camp near the southern port of tyre 25 miles 
south of sidon 
he worked at the camp for norwac a norwegian humanitarian group 
for three months before he vanished no group has claimed 
responsibility 
gilbert holleufer international red cross spokesman in lebanon 
said the suspension of activities in sidon will cut back assistance 
for wardisabled people at a red cross orthopedic center there the 
swiss technicians have left 
in beirut the estimated 12000 syrian troops in charge of 
security in the citys moslem sector offered safe conduct for 
surrendering hezbollahis but made no serious effort to stop the 
fighting 
the new clashes between hezbollah and amal struggling for 
dominance of the 1 million shiites lebanons largest sect also 
appeared to reflect growing strain between syria and iran the 
syriairan alliance has weakened since the aug 20 ceasefire in the 
eightyear war between iran and iraq 
police said that by saturday afternoon amal had evicted hezbollah 
from eight west beirut districts and was closing in on their 
militants in the three other neighborhoods 
about 25 hezbollah gunmen were seen surrendering to syrian troops 
in the zokak blatt district after amal fighters surrounded them in a 
high school 
the hezbollah fighters handed over their weapons to a syrian army 
captain who sent them off in seven private cars the officer 
refused to talk to reporters 
the amal leader in zokak blatt ayman shirri said the hezbollah 
fighters were being taken to the iranian embassy where they 
belong

washington democratic lawmakers want more from presidentelect 
george bush than his promise to start bargaining over the federal 
deficit his first day in office theyd like a detailed budget 
spelling out how he would cut spending and honor his pledge of no 
new taxes 
how do you negotiate with someone who has no position askedd 
rep william h gray iii dpa the outgoing house budget committee 
chairman who may be a member of the chambers democratic leadership 
next year 
the start of the fiscal 1990 budget wars is just weeks away yet 
bush has declined to provide details of his flexible freeze the 
vice president touted the proposal for balancing the budget 
frequently during his election campaign but he has revealed few 
specifics 
gray in the democratic radio address saturday called on reagan 
and bush to join together in putting together a budget that includes 
bushs economic plans 
this would be the single most effective way to reassure the 
nation and the world that we are on a responsible fiscal course 
gray said 
he said a failure of bush to present his plan would be a 
terrible mistake and send the wrong signal to financial markets 
and congress 
that is the road to dissension and stalemate not to a 
solution gray said 
some republicans however are urging bush not to produce a 
detailed budget of his own next year that would let him avoid 
revealing his positions until he begins negotiations with congress 
and could allow him to blame democrats if taxes are included in 
whatever budget package emerges 
congress would like to take very few positions if any until 
they have completely destroyed reagans budget or the 
presidentelects budget said sen pete domenici rnm ranking 
republican on the senate budget committee he shouldnt give them 
that opportunity 
domenici met for an hour last tuesday with richard darman whom 
bush has named as his budget director the senator said he urged 
darman not to introduce detailed budget revisions and said hes 
leaning in that direction 
bush himself said last week that he had not decided whether to 
introduce a spending plan of his own 
with the transition under way lawmakers and others are searching 
for indications of how bush intends to chop the deficit for fiscal 
1990 which begins next oct 1 to 100 billion the target required 
by law to reach that goal administration officials believe 35 
billion in deficit reduction will be needed 
early indications are that clues to bushs intentions wont be 
revealed on jan 9 when president reagan presents his last budget 
to congress reagan leaves office 11 days later 
reagan administration officials said last week they would soon 
finish a spending plan reflecting the priorities of reagan not 
bush so far they said they have kept bush aides apprised of their 
work but the transition team has not helped shape the final product 
were not going to be proposing a quote flexible freeze concept 
as part of ronald reagans last budget said joseph r wright the 
outgoing director of the presidents office of management and 
budget are there any specific george bush proposals from the 
election no there are not 
bush could if he chooses submit revisions to reagans 
blueprint a practice that has been routine for incoming chief 
executives since president eisenhower took office in 1953 
but this time it may be different 
democrats want to force bush to release details on how he will 
fulfill his campaign promises of reducing the deficit and increasing 
spending for antidrug environment and other programs without 
raising taxes 
a strategy of bargaining rather than laying out a program might 
be very smart politics as house democratic whip tony coelho 
dcalif conceded last week but it has angered democrats and could 
backfire in the longrun by creating a bitter climate that could 
prolong the always difficult budget negotiations 
its a total copout said coelho he said hed be specific 
after the election he campaigned on a falsehood 
bush has said his flexible freeze would balance the budget in a 
few years by limiting overall federal spending increases to the rate 
of inflation under the economic projections he has used federal 
revenues would grow faster than that and would soon overtake 
spending 
he has promised no new taxes no social security cuts no lagging 
of defense spending behind inflation and no slowdown in the growth 
of priority programs 
critics have said his economic assumptions are much too 
optimistic and that by exempting defense and social security from 
cuts along with the 150 billion annual interest payments on the 
debt his spending slashes would have to come from only onethird 
of the 11 trillion budget

president reagan urged americans on 
saturday to reject the siren song of trade protectionism and 
vowed to push in december for greater us access to overseas 
markets 
in his last nationally broadcast radio address from the 
presidential ranch in the santa ynez mountains near here reagan 
pledged to have us trade negotiators fight in montreal next month 
for more protection for us intellectual property rights 
investments and trade in services as well as goods 
the president was referring to a midterm review of the socalled 
uruguay round of negotiations under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade a multilateral pact in which the 
united states and some 95 other countries meet and discuss problems 
sin the field of international trade and competition 
reagan used saturdays adddres to again hail the election victory 
of canadian prime minister brian mulroney early last week saying 
the voters of canada sent a message to the world rejecting 
protectionist sentiment 
in this country he said the multimilliondollar trade deficits 
of recent years had led some misguided politicians to call for 
protectionism warning that otherwise we would lose jobs but they 
were wrong again in fact the united states not only didnt lose 
jobs we created more jobs than all the countries of western europe 
canada and japan combined 
we too often talk about trade while using the vocabulary of 
war in war for one side to win the other must lose he said 
but commerce is not warfare trade is an economic alliance that 
benefits both countries there are no losers only winners 
reagan argued that today protectionism is being used by some 
american politicians as a cheap form of nationalism our 
peaceful trading partners are not our enemies they are our allies 
we should be beware of the demigogues who are ready to declare a 
trade war against our friends 
he said the expansion of the international economy is not a 
foreign invasion it is an american triumph 
reagan said that when the multilateral trade talks open dec 5 in 
montreal we will be in the forefront of efforts to improve this 
system 
we want to open more markets for our markets to see to it that 
all nations play by the rules and to seek improvement in such areas 
as dispute resolution and agriculture he said 
our negotiators will be working hard for all of us the 
president promised 
reagan as he has in the past raised the ghost of the 
smoothawley act of 1930 a tariff law which he said had led to the 
great depression in which one out of four americans lost their jobs 
ever since that time americans have stayed true to our 
heritage by rejecting the siren song of protectionism reagan said 
the fiveminute radio address broadcast from a makeshift studio 
step up in a housetrailer on reagans 688acre property was 
reagans last from the ranch 
the president concludes a sixday vacation sunday and flies back 
to washington no more visits are scheduled to rancho del cielo 
before reagans term ends on jan 20 although the president and his 
wife nancy will spend about 10 days around christmas and new 
years day attending parties and visiting friends in los angeles and 
palm springs calif

here is the text of the democrats response to 
president reagans weekly radio address given by rep william h 
gray iii of pennsylvania 
thanksgiving is a uniquely american holiday when we make a point 
of giving thanks to the lord for our material blessings president 
reagan is understandably proud of the way that much of the american 
economy has performed in this sixth year of continued growth 
the president has spoken about international trade and the need 
to avoid protectionism all of us agree that protectionism is not 
the answer to our trade deficit we need open trade but we also 
need fair trade and a level playing field our international balance 
which turned from a surplus in 1980 to a huge 154 billion deficit 
last year illustrates how we can misuse our bountiful resources 
with the wrong policies the trade deficit has destroyed jobs and 
eroded our industrial base but the trade deficit fundamentally 
means that we spend more than we produce and that basic imbalance 
results from the budget deficit 
everyone knows that it is now time to deal with the budget 
deficit the plunge of the dollar and the tremors in the financial 
markets right after the election gave a clear signal the world is 
waiting impatiently for us leadership 
the nation and presidentelect bush now have a unique and 
unprecedented opportunity for the first time in 132 years we have a 
vice president moving up to become president we have a continuity 
of administration already reflected in mr bushs reappointment of 
some of president reagans most important cabinet officers in some 
areas mr bush is actively governing he has met with major foreign 
leaders and with the speaker of the house 
presidentelect bush and president reagan can take advantage of 
this unique opportunity to push the nation rapidly towards a fiscal 
solution all they need to do is have mr bush resent his budget 
program when the presidents budget is submitted to the congress as 
required by law in january that is what the nation and the world 
are waiting for the new presidents vision and program which is 
the essential basis for budget deliberations and action by the 
congress 
i am therefore asking president reagan and presidentelect bush 
to join together and begin work now on a budget embodying mr bushs 
program to be presented to congress in january to accomplish this 
president reagan should make available the resources of the office 
of management and budget to presidentelect bush his omb 
directordesignate mr darman and his transition team 
this would be the single most effective way to reassure the 
nation and the world that we are on a responsible fiscal course 
democrats in congress want to join the new administration in solving 
the deficit problem and solving it quickly this year we passed all 
the budget legislation before the beginning of the fiscal year if 
we push ahead now we can do the same next year 
mr bush told the american people during the election campaign 
that he had a plan to reduce the deficit it was called a flexible 
freeze he said ti would reduce the deficit without raising taxes 
protect social security provide the resources for a sound defense 
and allow increased funding for education protection of the 
environment and other vital national priorities these are all 
admirable goals if they are mutually attainable they will have 
great appeal and support in congress thats why the reaganbush 
budget should be ready in january not sometime much later in the 
spring 
lately there have been disturbing reports in the press that 
presidentelect bush is being advised not to present a budget plan 
that shows his own vision and program but instead to sit down and 
negotiate with congress without a plan i hope that these reports 
are wrong a failure to present a fiscal plan for the nation would 
be a terrible mistake it would send the wrong signal to the 
financial markets that we will continue to delay rather than to 
act it would send the wrong signal to the congress that a new 
administration will not be responsible and accountable for its 
policies that is the road to dissension and stalemate not to a 
solution 
it is essential to move ahead now to solve the budget problem to 
bring the trade deficit down and to solidify our economic future 
the american people the new congress and the world are waiting for 
some good oldfashioned leadership and vision the opportunity is 
here and the time is now

organizers did not say how much they expect to raise from the 
concert which will feature the south american creole mass a 
combination of argentine composer ariel ramirezs melodies and 
traditional argentine and hispanicamerican regional songs 
i thought in this spirit of the year in december that to do a 
mass is very appropriate carreras said at a news conference 
friday of course i am doing it in rome for obvious reasons the 
head office of the italian association against leukemia is here and 
italy is a place i consider my second country and to do a mass in 
rome it has to be at the vatican

the government released two 
aging and ailing black leaders saturday both colleagues of african 
national congress chief nelson mandela and prisoners for more than a 
decade 
harry gwala 69 a longtime member of the outlawed anc and 
zephania mothopeng 75 president of the pan africanist congress 
were released unconditionally on medicalhumanitarian grounds 
the prisons service said in a brief statement 
gwala was freed from westville prison in the indian ocean city of 
durban and mothopeng was released from diepkloof prison in the 
soweto township outside johannesburg 
gwala has spent more than 20 years in prison and was serving a 
life sentence for his involvement with the anc guerrilla movement 
im very much excited this came unexpectedly gwala said in 
a telephone interview from his home in the southeastern city of 
pietermaritzburg 
gwala is suffering from motorneuron disease a degenerative 
neurological disorder with no known cure gwala said the illness has 
left his arms paralyzed but his mind is clear 
mothopeng who has been seriously ill for several months was a 
member of the anc during the 1940s and 1950s he broke from the 
organization in 1959 to help establish the pan africanist congress 
both organizations are engaged in armed resistance against the 
whiteled government however the pan africanist congress favors 
black selfsufficiency in the struggle for political rights while 
the anc supports a multiracial approach 
mothopeng was arrested in 1976 and sentenced to 15 years in 
prison for his involvement with the outlawed organization he was 
elected president of the pan africanist congress in 1986 despite his 
imprisonment 
gwala and mothopeng became friends when they were both imprisoned 
on robben island off cape town in the early 1980s gwala said 
the releases are likely to further fuel speculation that mandela 
will be freed in coming months 
the governments decision also is the latest move apparently 
aimed at reducing domestic and international pressure on south 
africa in the past week the government has 
announced that mandela the countrys best known black leader 
would not return to prison when he completes his recovery from 
tuberculosis at a cape town hospital however mandela will remain 
in custody at a suitable location the government added 
endorsed a regional peace plan under which south africa would 
grant independence to southwest africa also known as namibia 
granted clemency to the sharpville six a group of blacks 
sentenced to death for complicity in a 1984 mob killing the death 
sentences replaced with lengthy jail terms had provoked 
international protest 
one is thankful that it looks like the milk of human kindness 
is not running dry with our government anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu said of gwalas release 
however tutu added the track record of our government does 
not give us too much hope that they are likely to act on only 
humanitarian grounds they take political considerations into 
account much more than acting on humanitarian grounds 
gwala said he still fully supported the goals of the anc the 
largest black guerrilla movement in south africa he said he did not 
know if he would resume his political activities due to the tough 
conditions under the state of emergency 
stateofemergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict 
reporting about unrest security force actions treatment of 
detainees some forms of protest and a broad range of statements 
the government considers subversive enforcement of the regulations 
has not been comprehensive 
gwala joined the thenlegal anc in 1944 and helped organize 
antiapartheid protests during the following decade he served in 
prison from 196472 following a conviction on sabotage he was 
arrested in 1975 and detained for two years in 1977 he was 
sentenced to life in prison for involvement with the anc 
mothopeng was a member of the anc youth league in the 1940s and 
helped organize antiapartheid protests in 1960 a year after he 
helped found the pan africanist congress he was arrested and 
sentenced to two years in prison for his political activities 
mothopeng was a teacher and education administrator in the soweto 
township outside johannesburg and was detained for varying lengths 
of time in the 1960s and 1970s 
under apartheid the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts

many of the 15 inmates of the federal 
prison near talladega who are slated for return to cuba say they 
worry about bad times and possible reprisals on the island they fled 
all you need to know about cuba you can learn by looking at the 
number of cubans who have come here said mario sosa hernandez 
who has been in prison since being caught in san francisco in 1984 
with 25 worth of heroin he insists wasnt his i could get hurt a 
lot if i have to go back there 
sosa said his record in cuba was clean before fidel castros 
communist takeover in 1959 after the victory of the revolution i 
had a problem with some violence and with marijuana he mused 
his hands cuffed behind his back in a tiny locked interview room 
sosa 50 and the other 14 were among the 125000 cubans who 
arrived on the fivemonth freedom flotilla boatlift from the 
cuban port of mariel in 1980 
in the wake of us charges that castro had used the boatlift as 
an opportunity to rid cuba of some prison and mental hospital 
inmates the cuban leader agreed in 1984 to take 2700 of the 
boatlift people back but after taking only a fraction of that 
number castro rescinded the agreement in 1985 
when cuba announced a year ago that it would resume the 
agreement cubans fearing deportation grabbed guards as hostages at 
federal prisons in atlanta and oakdale la holding the prisons for 
nearly two weeks 
the 15 inmates in prison here are among 114 who are in 
immigration and naturalization service custody because of past 
crimes and have been denied parole many others among the original 
list of 2700 are either paroled or are in state custody 
the us justice department so far has reviewed 28 of the 114 
cases and decided on deportation for the 15 
federal courts have ruled that cubans classified as excludable 
aliens can be held indefinitely until they are deemed ready for 
parole or are accepted by cuba or another country 
lawyers for the cubans are seeking an administrative review and 
the government has delayed deportations until the issue is decided 
meanwhile the 15 wait with 99 countrymen at talladega two to an 
85squarefoot cell with five hours of exercise and three showers a 
week when they leave the cells they are in cuffs and chains 
they say it beats cuban jails the justice department panels 
consider among other things the inmates behavior in cuba and in 
american prisons his potential for violence job prospects and 
personal harm that might follow a return to cuba 
renato olivasanchez arrested for selling cocaine in 1983 said 
he had a clean record in cuba until he got in trouble with the army 
for refusing to serve in a special services unit 
oliva who had a string of lesser arrests before his last one 
said his contact with family members here and in cuba has been 
very sporadic 
most of his family he said is in the cuban military or 
otherwise close to the government when i write i have to send 
the letters to another family and they give them to my family i 
cant write directly 
the united states sent 201 cubans back before cuba suspended the 
1984 repatriation agreement in 1985 of the 201 about 156 are free 
after spending six weeks in quarantine a few have died those with 
time left on their american sentences are serving it

one hundred and sixtythree years of collective 
experience will be missing from the senate floor when the 101st 
congress convenes in january 
seven senators are departing by their own choice including the 
one elected vice president who gives up his seat and vote on the 
floor to move to the status of presiding officer 
four were shown the door by voters 
the departures will force a reshuffling of several key positions 
inside the 200year old lawmaking body including the chairmanships 
of its appropriations budget and banking committees all are 
important players in a year in which the federal budget deficit is 
expected to dominate legislative scorecards 
six of those leaving the senate have served a dozen or more years 
the list includes the senates oldest and most senior member 
sen john stennis dmiss 87 who after 41 years of service is 
perhaps the chambers most revered member 
stennis who for years had pledged to plough my row to the 
end is leaving somewhat reluctantly his decision spurred by his 
advanced age and uncertain health he was severely wounded in a 
robbery attempt in 1973 and has been confined to a wheelchair since 
he lost a leg to cancer several years ago 
the senators departure opens up the chairmanship of the senate 
appropriations committee as well as the position of president pro 
tempore the senates highest constitutional office 
under the law stennis was third in line of succession to the 
presidency following the vice president and the speaker of the 
house 
stennis almost certainly will be replaced both in the 
appropriations chairmanship and as president pro tem by sen robert 
c byrd dwva who is stepping down as senate majority leader 
another retiree sen william proxmire dwis 73 is ending a 
31year career that began when he won a special 1957 election to 
succeed the controversial sen joseph r mccarthy 
proxmire missed only 18 roll call votes in his more than three 
decades of service and none in the last 22 years he cast 10261 
consecutive votes from april 1966 until the 100th congress adjourned 
last month a total 12152 roll calls were taken in the senate since 
proxmire arrived in 1957 proxmire was present and voting for 9985 
percent of them 
he delivered more than 3300 consecutive daily speeches on the 
us failure to ratify the 1948 treaty making genocide a crime and 
persisted until the senate ratified the pace and passed implementing 
legislation making genocide a crime under us law 
for this proxmire was hailed by bnai brith as one whose name 
will be forever enshrined in the pantheon of heroes who have 
fought so gallantly on behalf of mans humanity to man 
proxmire is perhaps best known by the public at large as father 
of the monthly golden fleece awards which since march of 1975 
targeted proxmires choices for the biggest example of ridiculous 
ironic or wasteful spending 
one example a federal grant for a study of why prisoners want to 
escape from jail 
he has announced that the award of the golden fleece will 
continue after his senate tenure ends he will continue to issue it 
as a member of the board of directors of the national taxpayers 
union 
proxmire was chairman of the senate banking committee and 
responsible for significant legislation in the field he was a 
senior member of the appropriations committee he often called being 
a member of the senate the best job in the country bar none 
better even than being president 
while stennis and proxmire went to the sidelines voluntarily 
sen lowell weicker rconn was shoved there by connecticuts 
voters losing a tight race to state atty gen joseph lieberman 
weicker heir to a squibb pharmaceutical fortune was the 
senates most liberal and independent republican an outspoken 
advocate who loudly and vigorously opposed the social agenda of 
conservatives 
he gained national attention in 1973 as a member of the senate 
watergate committee which he used as a forum to denounce the 
activities of president nixon and his staff 
also ending careers as senators this year are 
sen daniel quayle rind 41 who by virtue of his election 
to the vice presidency will become president of the senate and 
when he chooses preside over its deliberations but he can only 
vote to break a tie quayles selection as george bushs vice 
presidential running mate touched off a storm of criticism over his 
alleged lack of credentials to succeed to the nations highest 
office and his alleged use of family influence to win him a place in 
the indiana national guard thus avoiding combat service in vietnam 
quayle was elected to the senate in 1980 
sen lawton chiles dfla 58 chairman of the senate budget 
committee and a major figure in the congressional battles over the 
massive federal budget deficit chiles first won election in 1970 
after walking his state and earning the nickname walkin 
lawton chiles was heavily favored to win reelection and his 
decision to skip the race was a surprise he said he had lost his 
enthusiasm for the job at some stage maybe there is a burnout 
he said 
sen daniel evans rwash 58 a 12year governor of washington 
was appointed to his seat after the death of sen henry jackson 
dwash in september 1983 evans a member of the senate foreign 
relations committee also expressed frustration with the job 
complaining of a lack of substantive debate and said the senates 
eratic schedule had often denied him a personal life 
sen robert t stafford rvt 75 a former vermont governor 
was a member of the house when he was appointed in 1971 to fill the 
unexpired term of sen winston prouty dvt who had died he had 
previously served as a prosecutor state attorney general and 
lieutenant governor his senate career focused on the environment 
and education 
paul trible rva 42 said he was quitting the senate after 
one term because he wanted to spend more time with his family he is 
widely expected to become a candidate for governor of virginia in 
the senate trible was a member of the senate irancontra 
investigating committee and compiled a conservative voting record 
john melcher dmont 64 by profession a veternarian lost the 
senate seat he had held since 1976 in an upset to republican conrad 
burns a farm broadcaster in the senate melcher concentrated on 
farm issues during the irancontra affair he complained about those 
who described members of the national security council staff as 
freewheeling white house cowboys that was demeaning to cowboys 
melcher said 
chic hecht rnev 59 a conservative clothing store owner who 
was almost invisible in the senate was beaten in his bid for a 
second term by democratic gov richard bryan hecht was known for 
slips of the tongue and once refered to a proposed nuclear dump site 
in his state as a nuclear supository 
david k karnes rneb at 39 the youngest of the departing 
senators was appointed to his seat in march 1987 to fill the 
vacancy created by the death of sen edward zorinsky a democrat he 
was defeated by former democratic gov robert kerrey after a 
campaign in which karnes in a major gaffe told his farm belt 
voters that we need fewer farmers

clustered around television sets south 
koreans have been watching the first political hearings in the 
nations history with a mix of fascination indignation and pride 
the national assembly has been conducting extensive public 
hearings into corruption human rights violations and other abuses 
under the authoritarian government of former president chun doohwan 
the hearings which began early this month and could go into 
1989 have bewitched millions of south koreans the live broadcasts 
have set new viewing records and life has noticeably slowed in seoul 
and other cities as people have flocked around tv sets to catch 
latest developments 
what was seen on television was so shocking although it had 
vaguely been guessed at that people lost even the strength to speak 
out said chong unbung an editor of the korea times newspaper 
koreans have witnessed once powerful former generals and 
ministers questioned berated and denounced by lawmakers demanding 
answers about the repressive chun years people who endured the 
restraints of the chun government shake their heads in wonder at how 
the political situation has changed 
everyone is watching said cho jinsun an office worker 
what is happening is unbelievable 
office employees routinely gather around televisions at work to 
watch the hearings televisions in train and bus stations and 
airports are thronged by watchers and shops and restaurants show 
the hearings to attract customers 
some colleges delayed examinations because many students were too 
busy watching the hearings to study 
police report that traffic has dipped when major figures have 
appeared at the hearings people say they rearrange their work and 
social schedules to accomodate the hearings the first ever 
televised 
the national assembly had limited powers to hold hearings in the 
past but a 1987 constitution empowered the legislature to 
investigate government affairs 
south koreans accustomed to decades of censorship and 
authoritarian governments have been astonished by the flood of 
revelations it has fueled even more anger and resentment against 
chun 
all misdeeds and corruption must be exposed said lee 
kyungjai a journalist 
the revelations played a major role in forcing chun to apologize 
to the nation wednesday for abuses surrender his property and go 
into rural exile at a buddhist monastery some of his relatives and 
associates have been convicted or charged with embezzlement and 
other crimes 
in his televised apology chun said to the nation how much 
have you been enraged by a flood of unsavory tv radio magazine and 
newspaper reports about me 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in 
1980 left office at the end of a sevenyear term in february 
president roh taewoo who took over after winning last decembers 
presidential election has pledged to introduce full democracy 
roh on saturday urged an end to the hearings by dec 31 and said 
his administration would actively investigate any unanswered 
questions but the opposition lawmakers who dominate the national 
assembly have pledged a thorough probe 
political analysts say the hearings are part of a shift toward an 
enduring democratic system for the first time since the nations 
creation in 1948 
it probably will change the style and quality of koreas 
politics for good said analyst rhee chongik 
but south koreans have also discovered that public hearings do 
not necessarily get to the truth and that witnesses and legislators 
can be uncooperative or misguided 
television stations and newspapers say they have been flooded 
with complaints that some witnesses have given vague or misleading 
answers people also complain that legislators are using the 
hearings to seek national fame 
one obvious negative fact is many politicians overreactions 
and emotional outbursts said rhee the political analyst 
kim sangho a businessman who intently follows the hearings 
said the revelations were teaching koreans what politics and 
democracy really are others hope the hearings become a fixed part 
of korean politics to ensure officials are accountable 
i believe parliamentary hearings are necessary to cultivate 
democracy he said

the new effort by opec to limit oil production 
if successful will worsen inflationary pressures in the united 
states at least temporarily and put more upward pressure on interest 
rates many economists believe 
that would mean slower growth next year and make presidentelect 
george bushs effort to trim the federal deficit without tax 
increases even harder these analysts said 
falling energy prices have been a key factor helping offset 
droughtinduced increases in food prices over the past several 
months 
but that fall apparently is about to be reversed instead of 
declining gasoline and heating oil costs will be rising just as 
the worst impact of the summer drought will be hitting grocery 
stores economists believe 
these forecasts are being made even though analysts are skeptical 
that the 13 nations of opec will be able to reach their target of 
pushing oil prices up to 18 per barrel 
instead a more likely outcome is that oil prices will rise to 
between 15 and 16 per barrel up from lows of 12 per barrel this 
year 
if that occurs david wyss an economist at data resources inc 
predicted that consumer prices will climb at an annual rate 
approaching 6 percent in the early months of 1989 
that would be up from an expected rise in consumer prices of just 
45 percent this year 
however economists predict this inflationary spike wont last 
long because of their belief the new opec accord will fall apart as 
various countries cheat on their quotas 
the production cuts will soak up some of the excess inventories 
and prices will firm said donald ratajczak director of the 
economic forecasting project at georgia state university that 
will last until the heating season tapers off at the end of february 
when i believe energy prices will start falling again 
because of his belief that cheating will keep opec from ever 
reaching the 185 millionperday production limit ratajczak said 
he sees overall consumer prices climbing by about 45 percent next 
year essentially the same as for 1988 
wyss agreed that inflationary preassures should be at their worst 
in the first three months of next year and then begin to ease 
however he said if opec is more successful at limiting production 
than analysts now believe that could spell trouble especially with 
the united states already operating at near fullemployment and with 
us factories producing at high operating rates 
there is a danger that this inflationary spurt could set off a 
wageprice spiral wyss said in such an occurrence higher energy 
prices would be translated into higher costs for other goods which 
would prompt workers to demand bigger pay increases to keep up with 
the rising costs 
that would force the federal reserve to squeeze down on the 
growth of the money supply and push up interest rates in an effort 
to dampen an overheating economy 
if the oil scenario went the worst way then we are talking 
about much higher interest rates and a probable recession in late 
1989 or 1990 wyss said 
even with just the small blip in inflation now expected the fed 
is likely to be nudging interest rates higher in the months ahead 
which will mean slower growth next year analysts said 
wyss said dri is forecasting that the overall economy as 
measured by the gross national product will expand at a sluggish 
rate of 23 percent next year 
that forecast is in line with the consensus view of 51 top 
economists surveyed each month by blue chip economic indicators but 
it is far below the 35 percent gnp projection the reagan 
administration announced last tuesday 
using more optimistic assumptions about overall growth inflation 
and interest rates the administration says it only needs 35 
billion in spending cuts to meet a target of 100 billion for the 
federal deficit in the 1990 fiscal year which begins next oct 1 
however wyss said his firms more pessimistic assumptions put 
the total deficit cuts that will be needed next year at 55 billion 
a target that would virtually rule out the use of spending cuts 
alone to meet the grammrudman 100 billion deficit reduction target 
however bush who must negotiate with congress over the 1990 
budget once reagan leaves office has consistently maintained that 
he has no intention of going back on his campaign pledge not to 
raise taxes an assertion that has made financial markets jittery 
since the election

marine mammal rescuers tried to feed a young 
brydes whale saturday but it was in critical condition a day after 
being rescued from a sandbar 
a biologist at sea world where the 4200pound female whale was 
taken late friday said the whale might have become separated from 
its mother and then blown farther away by tropical storm keith 
which swept through the gulf of mexico early last week brydes 
whales are native to offshore tropical water 
dr dan odell also the scientific coordinator for the southeast 
us marine mammal stranding network gave a dim prognosis for the 
whales survival but said the 22foot 9inch mammal was resting 
and started making sounds 
thats about as good as you can expect from a beached whale at 
this point said odell its been in a very stressful set of 
circumstances probably for some days 
squid were placed in the whales mouth every three or four hours 
but the whale did not respond well to the food odell said they 
hoped to get it feeding on whole food like that rather than 
resorting to a stomach tube 
the whale was rescued friday night after it beached itself in the 
intercoastal waterway near honeymoon island in the gulf of mexico 
scientists loaded it onto a stretcher between two boats then drove 
it by truck to the marine animal park 
the whale was estimated to be between 1 and 2 years old 
brydes whales not an endangered species grow to 40 feet in 
length 
they are a species of baleen whale which have no teeth but use a 
series of flexible fibrous plates that act as sieves to feed on a 
wide range of sea life from plankton to shrimp and squid

the federal rural electrification 
administration says it is taking control of rates charged by an 
indiana power association to pay back a loan but state officials 
say the federal agency cant do that 
rea officials said it is the first time the agency has tried to 
take over ratesetting powers by a utility that owes it money 
the rea contends the wabash valley power association which filed 
for bankruptcy reorganization in 1985 owes it nearly 900 million 
mostly in interest and original debt it borrowed to invest in the 
marble hill nuclear power plant 
marble hill was abandoned and never finished an attempt by 
wabash valley to recover the marble hill loan through increased 
rates was denied in 1987 by the state utility regulatory commission 
regulators said state law bars raising rates to pay for a power 
plant never placed in service 
wabash valley which serves 24 member rural electric distribution 
cooperatives with 400000 customers in northern indiana is involved 
in negotiations with public service indiana which it sued to 
recover nearly 500 million invested in marble hill 
the rate takeover was announced in letters mailed from jack van 
mark the reas acting administrator to edward p martin wabash 
valleys general manager and to the indiana utility regulatory 
commission the indianapolis star reported saturday 
van mark proposed a 6 percent annual increase for retail 
customers over three years and a 9 percent annual increase for the 
same period for the rural cooperatives served by wabash 
we believe that wabash is capable of repaying its debt and 
calculate that the required rate increases are the minimum 
necessary he said in the letter 
but leslie duvall chairman of the indiana utility regulatory 
commission said he does not believe a federal agency head has the 
authority to supercede a state commission 
the commission position for many years has been that the iurc 
is the only legal entity for setting retail rates of the utilities 
under our jurisdiction i am very confident that position will not 
be changed because we absolutely are convinced it is correct 
duvall said 
rea officials said the action is necessary because the state 
commission did not approve rates high enough for wabash valley to 
repay its debt 
the rea will file a debt restructuring proposal for wabash valley 
and an elaboration of a rate takeover plan with federal bankruptcy 
court in indianapolis on tuesday 
we are going to continue talking and looking for some sort of 
agreement said ruth ann mason spokeswoman for the rea but the 
bottom line is that the federal government is entitled to the money 
it loaned 
its unfortunate the plant didnt get built but somebody has 
to pay for it the debt said mason the federal government 
already has enough of a deficit 
in his letter van mark expressed concern that taxpayers and the 
other rural electric cooperatives who borrow from the rea revolving 
fund will bear the burden of the wabash obligation 
we cannot allow federal interests to be so seriously 
compromised he wrote 
van mark said higher rates should go into effect as soon as 
bankruptcy proceedings are completed or a reorganization plan is 
confirmed by the bankruptcy court 
john w samples wabash valley spokesman said the cooperative is 
aware the letter has been sent but he would not comment until it is 
received 
wabash valley buys electricity from power generating companies 
and resells it to the rural cooperatives

him to bite on questions about upcoming cabinet appointments 
hey look you guys youre scaring the fish away there arent

commenting on a story in saturdays editions of the washington 
post that bush would consider a wide array of possible defense cuts 
next week hart said 
during the transition process the vice president is welcoming 
discussion on a wide variety on policy considerations and on people 
simply because options are being given to him and being 
discussed and raised doesnt mean theyre going to be accepted

texas remains the frontrunner for the job and that bush had 
decided to keep on cia director william webster at least for the 
time being

president mikhail s gorbachevs easing of the 
tight reins that have kept the 15 republics under moscows strict 
control for decades has released long pentup ethnic anger from the 
baltics to the caucasus 
the central governments new tolerance has resulted in 
demonstrations strikes and political moves unheard of before 
gorbachev came to power in 1985 
in a period of less than two weeks ethnic tensions have broken 
out in the countrys southern and western fringes 
the baltic republic of estonia on nov 16 issued a declaration 
of sovereignty from the central government in all areas but 
defense and foreign policy it also approved an amendment to the 
republics constitution requiring estonian approval of all new 
soviet laws 
officials in the baltic republics of latvia and lithuania blunted 
similar moves but the latter declared lithuanian its official 
language and restored the flag of the state that was independent 
before world war ii 
in the southern republic of azerbaijan ethnic fighting broke out 
between moslem azerbaijanis and christian armenians who dominate 
the nagornokarabakh region and want it to be annexed to neighboring 
armenia 
the ethnic tensions have culminated in massive demonstrations and 
strikes that first began in february last week in the largest 
outbreak of violence in azerbaijan since early spring at least six 
people were killed and more than 100 injured 
following the kremlins rejection in july of the armenians 
demands many activists said they had lost faith in gorbachev 
in the adjacent republic of georgia thousands of protesters 
proposed changes that would strengthen the authority of the 
republics 
such widespread assertion of local demands would have been 
inconceivable before gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness encouraged people to express themselves more freely 
gorbachev has praised citizens increased interest in politics as 
a sign that his reforms are taking hold 
whats happening in estonia is perestroika or restructuring 
gorbachev told reporters during his visit to india earlier this 
month 
on saturday the soviet unions highest executive body convened 
calling estonias effort to declare greater autonomy from moscow 
unconstitutional and invalid official media said 
but president mikhail s gorbachev acknowledged before the 
presidium of the supreme soviet that national constitutional 
amendments that he proposed may have angered estonians and others by 
reducing local rule 
the soviet leaders call for reforms has stirred ethnic feelings 
submerged for years but the new voice of local activists has also 
created new problems for the kremlin 
the proposed consitutional amendments would strengthen the 
central government by establishing a council of peoples deputies 
which would elect a legislature and a president with enhanced powers 
baltic activists who are seeking greater cultural political and 
economic autonomy under the banner of gorbachevs reforms are 
angered by the proposed amendments they say the changes would take 
away some of the local powers of the republics 
in the baltics national selfconsciousness is the essence of 
our restructuring relating to our language culture and of course 
our own government said algirdas kaushidas a member of the 
governing board of the lithuanian movement for perestroika 
the baltics are gorbachevs biggest stronghold were the 
biggest army he has kaushidas said in an interview from vilnius 
but vn kudryatsev head of the soviet academy of sciences 
institute of state and law said in an interview published friday by 
tass that people were getting carried away 
heres a paradox people ruled by the best of intentions 
wishing to democraticize our society propose it seems to them a 
more perfect system he said i dont see the logic it seems to 
me that most of all emotion and haste are acting here 
there seems to be little or no fear of moscow in many of the 
republican capitals if all the small peoples join together we 
can win an estonian who traveled to the armenian capital of 
yerevan recently told a crowd there 
under current law republics have the theoretical right to secede 
from the soviet union but moscows control has been so strong that 
such a move was inconceivable the proposed amendments aimed at 
controlling the republics demands for more autonomy would 
eliminate the right to secede

here is the text of the state department 
statement on the rejection of an application for a visa to visit the 
united states from plo leader yasser arafat 
the 1947 united nations headquarters agreement obligates the 
united states to provide certain rights of entry transit and 
residence to persons invited to the united nations headquarters 
district in new york city 
the congress of the united states conditioned the entry of the 
us into the un headquarters agreement on the retention by the 
us government of the authority to bar the entry of aliens 
associated with or invited by the united nations in order to 
safeguard its own security 
in this regard us law excludes members of the plo from entry 
into the united states by virtue of their affiliation in an 
organization which engages in terrorism the secretary of state is 
vested by law with the discretion to recommend to the attorney 
general that the prohibition against a particular plo member be 
waived 
the united nations general assembly in l974 invited the palestine 
liberation organization to participate as an observer at the general 
assembly the united stats acknowledged that this un invitation 
obligates the us to accord plo observers entry transit and 
residence therefore visa waivers have been issued to such 
individuals as a routine practice as a result a plo observer 
mission has been in operation at the un since l975 the plo 
therefore has had and continues to have ample opportunity to make 
its positions known to the membership of the united nations 
on november 24 l988 we received an application from mr yasser 
arafat chairman of the plo for a visa to attend the united nations 
general assembly session in new york city as an invitee the 
secretary of state has decided not to recommend a waiver of 
ineligibility in this case the visa application therefore is not 
approved 
the us government has convincing evidence that plo elements 
have engaged in terrorism against americans and others this 
evidence includes a series of operations undertaken by the force 17 
and the hawari organizations since the plo claimed to forswear the 
use of terrorism in the cairo declaration of november l985 
as chairman of the plo mr arafat is responsible for actions of 
these organizations which are units of fatah an element of the plo 
of which he also is chairman and which is under his control the 
most recent sign of mr arafats associations with terrorism was the 
presence at the algiers session of the palestine national council 
pnc this month of abu abbas a member of the executive committee 
of the plo who has been convicted by the italian judicial system of 
the murder of an american citizen mr leon klinghoffer 
in summary we find that 
the plo through certain of its elements has employed terrorism 
against americans 
mr arafat as chairman of the plo knows of condones and 
lends support to such acts he therefore is an accessory to such 
terrorism 
terrorism and those involved in it are a serious threat to our 
national security and to the lives of american citizens 
the headquarters agreement contained in public law 80357 
reserves to us the right to bar the entry of those who represent a 
threat to our security 
the united states firmly believes that palestinian political 
rights must be recognized and addressed a comprehensive settlement 
of the arabisraeli conflict is achievable through the peace process 
that already has brought significant progress 
palestinian participation is required at every stage of the 
negotiations required to achieve peace justice and security 
participation requires responsibilities however all parties must 
demonstrate their desire to make peace they must adhere to 
internationally accepted principles and norms no participant in a 
peace process can wave the flag of justice in one hand and brandish 
the weapon of terrorism in the other all participants must 
renounced violence and terrorism 
the outcome of the pnc session in algiers produced signs that 
there are palestinians who are trying to move the plo in a 
constructive way that is encouraging and should continue it is 
unfortunate that the blight of terrorism still afflicts the 
palestinian cause and leaves no alternative to decisions such as the 
secretary has taken today

president chadli bendjedids moves to 
loosen his ruling partys grip on the country and avoid further 
unrest face opposition in the army and political elite as the party 
congress begins sunday 
the 5000 delegates to the sixth national liberation front 
congress in addition to considering reform will choose a 
secretarygeneral during the twoday meeting 
bendjedid proposed reform after rising prices unemployment and 
food shortages sparked riots in october that by official count 
killed 176 people unofficial reports put the figure at up to 500 
the president wants to revamp the party by bringing in new and 
younger faces a party source said he wants to get a solid majority 
behind his new premier kasdi merbah and begin revitalizing the 
economy 
algeria faces a 23 billion foreign debt a 22 percent 
unemployment rate and shrinking oil revenues due to a world oil glut 
but bendjedid is faced with opposition from an old guard 
comfortable with the monopoly of power built up over the 26 years 
since independence from france 
the source a party central committee member close to bendjedid 
said the president will have to slow down proposed reforms to win 
agreement to the changes the sources spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
a move toward a multiparty democracy discussed a month ago 
seems on a back burner the political program says the front does 
not exclude that political action developed at grassroots level 
could lead eventually to political pluralism 
but the central committee source and many other observers agree 
that a multiparty system is not coming in the near future 
according to the constitution the secretarygeneral now 
bendjedid becomes the sole candidate in the presidential elections 
the elections are scheduled for february 
bendjedid has not announced whether he will seek a third 
fiveyear term but he is widely expected to 
bendjedids speech oct 10 promising the reforms has led to 
heightened expectations among many algerians and the question most 
asked by political observers is whether the president will deliver 
enough change fast enough to avert new riots 
the exact form the changes will take is not clear the reform 
program as published in the official press is more of a 
philosophical statement than a concrete plan of action 
the national liberation front began as a military organization 
leading the revolution that began nov 1 1954 and emerged as a 
party in the late 1970s 
bendjedid a military man tried to minimize the role of the army 
and has been trying since 1985 to overcome resistance to 
liberalization 
since the riots the president has appointed merbah and a new 
government of technocrats removed the no 2 man in the party and 
made changes in the top army command 
on nov 3 voters approved a referendum that changed 14 articles 
of the constitution one measure granted wider powers to the premier 
and making him directly responsible to the national assembly

a senior hungarian official said in september that some of the 
65000 soviet troops in hungary could be pulled back under an

nearly 4 billion feet of baling twine enough 
to encircle earth more than 95 times and worth as much as 6 million 
was ruined after the ship transporting it took on water during a 
north atlantic storm 
the 12000 tons of sisal twine was bound for duluth and then to 
upper midwest farmers to tie bales of hay an executive said it was 
aboard a greekowned ship carrying the load from brazil when the 
storm struck thursday 
its a tremendous loss to us said joseph urista director 
and part owner of united rope distributors of minneapolis the 
company is a subsidiary of sisalana inc a brazilian company that 
makes twine from sisal a tropical fiber 
urista said the twine was valued at 5 million to 6 million it 
was insured but he said his company will have to buy replacement 
twine from competitors and increase its own production in order to 
meet the midwestern farm demand 
the 316000 bales of twine could have tied 79 million small bales 
of hay and well over 11 million large ones he said 
the ships 27 filipino crewmen and east indian officers were 
rescued by a canadian coast guard helicopter about 400 miles south 
of sable island an island off nova scotia none was injured 
the rescue took place in 25 to 35knot winds and 22foot seas as 
the remains of tropical storm keith approached the area

forms asking for information on suspected 
drug activity have been included in bills mailed to the citys water 
customers to give people a chance to snitch in private about 
possible criminal activity 
theres a number of people in the community who are fearful for 
their own safety whether real or imagined and this provides a 
way we can look at it police chief darrell pepper said 
the forms state that they are not official complaints and ask for 
as many details as possible they also carry this message your 
help is very important but do not take unnecessary risks or actions 
on your own 
the forms have spaces for license numbers of suspicious cars 
locations of suspicious activity and ask questions that include 
have you seen apparent drug transactions or drug paraphernalia at 
or near the vicinity of the residence exchange of money or goods 
for small packages 
do you know what kind of drugs are being sold how do you 
know 
pepper said returned forms come directly to him he destroys any 
that seem inappropriate or vindictive 
were only interested in things that are of a criminal 
nature pepper said 
so far about a half dozen forms have been returned none has 
contained information about suspected criminal activity the police 
didnt already know about pepper said 
some people have written notes on the forms comparing the mailing 
to the nazis asking people to spy on their neighbors pepper said 
i guess where im at is that were providing the citizenry an 
opportunity to inform us of any of their suspected problems he 
said he said other cities have done similar mailings 
the police prepared similar report forms more than a year ago and 
have distributed them at several community meetings

a pillow salesman wants to help singer john 
denver pay for a trip into outer space but lyle george has only a 
oneway ticket in mind 
george said his goal is to raise 5 million or half the 10 
million denver has said he would need to spend one week aboard the 
soviet space station mir 
denver who approached the soviets about a space trip has said 
it would be inappropriate for him personally to pay the soviet space 
program the singer said he hoped individual and corporate 
sponsorships will enable him to go into space by december 1989 
george decided to respond by opening the fund at state national 
bank in wayne which is 90 miles northwest of omaha he donated 10 
and said hes received some pledges 
i thought it was kind of bizarre when he wanted people to chip 
in george said but i decided id be willing to chip in if i 
could be guaranteed that none of the money would be spent to bring 
him back 
george said hes not worried about how denver would return to 
earth 
if he finds a way back more power to him said george 
adding that he once was a john denver fan 
my first album was a john denver album george said 
the first song i listened to on the radio that i remember was 
rocky mountain high but i feel john denver has drifted off of

the canadian earthquake felt over a wide area of 
the northeastern united states should get people to pay more 
attention to making essential buildings in the region 
earthquakeproof a geologist said saturday 
earthquakes in new england are relatively infrequent but they 
do occur said dr john ebel a seismologist at the weston 
observatory at boston college in newton with that in mind we 
need to be sure that critical facilities are made to stand up to 
earthquakes 
ebel said massachusetts is one of the few states in new england 
that have a seismic provision required in the construction of major 
structures like tall buildings and hospitals new york state 
recently required that some structures meet earthquake codes ebel 
said 
nuclear power plants in the region are constructed to withstand 
earthquakes ebel said 
fridays quake centered 95 miles north of quebec city 
registered 60 on the richter scale according to us and canadian 
seismic monitors 
less than 12 hours later two aftershocks had been recorded and 
more were expected although no damage was reported state officials 
said saturday 
geophysicist dick holt at the weston geophysical laboratory said 
aftershocks could register up to 50 on the richter scale 
the main tremor was felt in the northeastern united states from 
michigan to washington dc 
one lady called us and said she had whitecaps in her fish tank 
and her chandelier was shaking said pennsylvania state police 
cpl clifford williams near erie pa 
there was no structural damage reported although authorities 
were told of broken windows in maine shelves and dishes falling in 
rhode island and several intravenous bottles knocked over and 
broken at a wilkesbarre pa hospital 
police in some areas were swamped with calls while other people 
never felt a thing in ohio as an example police in columbus 
about in the center of the state said several people called to 
report feeling the tremor but officials in youngstown closer to 
the quake epicenter were not aware of the quake 
people in cleveland reported feeling buildings move but a few 
miles away seismic monitoring equipment at the perry nuclear power 
plant did not detect the quake said todd schneider a spokesman for 
cleveland electric illuminating co 
in new york city firefighters were sent to 40 separate locations 
in manhattan where tremors were reported but no damage was found 
said fire lt kenneth murphy people in other buildings on the 
granite island didnt notice the quake 
in massachusetts several people felt the tremor friday night 
we ran out of our house our lampshade was shaking we were 
shaking said carol dalessandro 40 of wakefield 
at the top of the hub restaurant on the 52nd floor of the 
prudential center in boston about 120 people were dining when the 
earthquake struck 
it was enough to make you feel queasy said maitre d stephen 
brown the entire dining room felt it everyone felt they were 
becoming dizzy or faint they all sort of smiled and looked at each 
other no one felt panicked or anything 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude an earthquake measuring 5 on the richter scale can 
cause considerable damage a 6 reading severe damage and a 7 is a 
major earthquake 
the strongest earthquake in canada this century was recorded off 
the coast of british columbia in 1949 and measured 8 on the richter 
scale

eight people were arrested saturday 
during an antiabortion protest outside a planned parenthood clinic 
where hundreds of demonstrators heckled women arriving to have 
abortions 
six men and two women were arrested on charges of disorderly 
conduct during the earlymorning confrontation said brookline 
police officer william ellis 
police refused to identify those who were arrested but said they 
were members of operation rescue a national antiabortion group 
which has staged several protests in the greater boston area and 
around the country in recent months 
about 125 protesters blocked the sidewalk and stairs leading to 
the clinic some of them clasped hands and sat down along the 
sidewalk while others prayed loudly and carried signs depicting 
aborted fetuses 
im praying for the women who are going in for abortions 
said antiabortion activist charlene lister theyll have the 
guilt and the torment 
the antiabortion activists were often drowned out by about 250 
supporters of choice on abortion who chanted slogans and carried 
their own signs 
planned parenthood spokeswoman susan newsom said the group heard 
friday that operation rescue was planning a protest and mobilized 
the counterdemonstration by telephoning supporters 
they think they have the answer for everyone but they dont 
said newsom theyre not persuading anyone if anything i think 
they alienate mainstream antiabortionists 
newsom said planned parenthood told the women scheduled to have 
abortions saturday that they could reschedule appointments but she 
said all chose to come despite the protest 
planned parenthood counselor nancy drooker said 12 women came for 
abortions at the clinic saturday 
antiabortion activist kenneth berthiaume said he would continue 
to attend demonstrations because we have to keep them from killing 
babies they kill more babies every year than they killed all the 
men in world war ii 
recent operation rescue demonstrations stem from an abortion 
protest in atlanta that began when the democratic national 
convention was held there in july and has resulted in more than 
1200 arrests over several weeks

the soviet unions top executive body on saturday 
threw out estonias declaration of limited sovereignty ruling that 
the baltic republics bid to set its own course was a violation of 
the constitution 
president mikhail s gorbachev said the estonian legislatures 
attempt to take charge of all matters but defense and foreign policy 
and to review all new soviet laws was in deep contradiction with 
the constitution of the ussr and must be rejected as mistaken 
not having any legal force 
gorbachevs remarks made to the presidium of the supreme soviet 
were reported by the official tass news agency but a rare film 
report of the session led the evening television news program 
vremya indicating its importance to the soviet leadership 
the kremlins action three days before the nations parliament 
votes on a controversial rewrite of the national constitution dealt 
a blow to recent efforts in estonia two other baltic republics and 
other soviet regions to loosen moscows grip on their affairs 
but gorbachev who convened the presidium acknowledged that 
national constitutional amendments that he has proposed have angered 
estonians and people in other republics by restricting rather than 
expanding local autonomy 
meanwhile in the capital cities of the two other baltic 
republics on saturday grassroots political organizations organized 
protests against the proposed constitutional amendments 
tass reported that in riga latvia members of the peoples front 
waved the redandwhite flag of the formerly independent latvian 
republic they were protesting their legislatures failure tuesday 
to follow estonias path and challenge moscows authority 
in lithuania where legislators also backed away from a direct 
challenge to the kremlin protesters rallied to demand that the 
national amendments be withdrawn tass said it did not give details 
the vremya report on the presidiums action said in connection 
with the noncorrespondence with the soviet constitution of several 
statements and declarations adopted by the estonian supreme soviet 
on nov 16 the presidium of the supreme soviet of the ussr 
declared them invalid 
a week ago legislative commissions of the supreme soviet found 
estonias constitutional amendment reserving the right to review 
soviet law at odds with the constitution and passed its 
recommendation to the supreme soviet 
a day after estonia took its action tass reported it would be 
considered by the presidium and that estonian officials would be 
invited to attend the meeting 
tass said the presidium heard a commission report as well as from 
estonian president arnold rutel 
the presidium ordered development of a system by which the soviet 
of nationalities one of two chambers of the national supreme 
soviet and a constitutional review committee would widen and 
protect the rights of the 15 republics that make up the soviet union 
baltic activists pushing for greater autonomy under the banner of 
gorbachevs reforms say the constitutional amendments would take 
away some of their power rather than grant greater local control 
the kremlin has expressed some willingness to compromise on the 
issue 
gorbachev told the presidium as a result of democratic 
discussion of these documents we have today drafts of laws which 
significantly differ from published and presented for discussion 
earlier 
i believe that those changes improve these drafts and what is 
most significant they express the mood of the dominant majority of 
the working people of the country he said 
they include many corrections and exclude some points which 
caused anxiety and misunderstandings he said 
earlier this week a legislative panel recommended that the new 
council of peoples deputies to be created under the amendments not 
be given power to throw out laws adopted by the republics 
on thursday the ruling communist party politburo noted 
complaints that the bills could be substantially improved 
radio moscow said the presidium received about 200000 letters 
about the project it said most approved it but many offered 
suggested improvements 
as a result many provisions have been improved radio moscow 
said

hansen a 23yearold danish grandmaster appeared to gain a winning 
position against world champion garri kasparov

sitting in an elizabethan chamber where william 
shakespeares twelfth night was first performed three british 
judges on saturday ruled unanimously that the bard was truly the 
author of the plays that bear his name 
an audience of 350 crowded into middle temple hall in londons 
court district to watch lawyers and witnesses argue whether the wool 
merchants son from stratforduponavon or edward de vere the 17th 
earl of oxford actually wrote shakespeares plays and poems 
lord templeman one of the judges declared its said that 
shakespeare received very little education 
well it is a proven fact that abraham lincoln didnt go to 
school for more than a year and no one suggests that the gettysburg 
address was written by one of those ghostwriters who now haunt 
the white house 
the tongueincheek case was decided by templeman and two other 
members of the law lords britains highest court the sevenhour 
hearing with breaks for lunch and tea was marked by scholarship 
and bursts of humor 
novelist jeffrey archer who planned the daylong hearing opened 
it with a quote from american actor and shakespeare enthusiast sam 
wanamaker i am fascinated by the authorship question but the 
plays the thing 
an estimated 36000 in ticket sales from the hearing will help 
fund wanamakers project to rebuild the globe theater where 
shakespeares plays were performed for london audiences on its 
original 16thcentury site by the thames river 
with judges witnesses and lawyers behaving as they would in a 
reallife court of law the hearing was being filmed for a possible 
tv production 
charles vere 23yearold descendant of the earl and an oxford 
university student made the case for his ancestor after three us 
supreme court justices found the evidence wanting in a similar 
hearing 14 months ago in washington 
the us justices william j brennan jr harry a blackmun and 
john paul stevens expressed unease about the authorship of 
shakespeares works but ruled the evidence insufficient to ascribe 
them to de vere 
its important to get people to understand people who are 
prepared to take up the cudgels said vere whose full name is 
charles francis topham de vere beauclerk he was speaking in an 
interview before the hearing 
de vere advocates are rehashing more than 200yearold argument 
that shakespeare lacked the knowledge of foreign travel and court 
life that features in the works 
they say de vere a dandy and poet familiar with elizabethan 
court life wrote the plays and poems but that conventions of the 
day stopped him putting his name to them they say he therefore used 
the pseudonym shakespeare or paid shakespeare to be his front 
the judges ruled after hearing the arguments of witnesses and two 
senior lawyers robert alexander for de vere and sydney kentridge 
for shakespeare 
kentridge 66 who was born in johannesburg south africa is 
better known for his work in such south african causes as the 
inquest on black activist steve biko and the trial of the 
sharpeville six 
this whole thing is worthwhile because it makes people think 
about shakespeare kentridge said 
opinions wondered whether the proceedings were needed 
in my view people would be far better off reading his work 
said anne barton a cambridge university english professor

a ship finally unloaded its toxic ash from 
philadelphia after wandering the worlds seas for more than two 
years in search of a place to dump its unwanted cargo a port 
official said saturday 
no one disclosed where the pelicano a 19yearold freighter 
left the poisonous waste the environmental group greenpeace earlier 
charged that it had been dropped somewhere in the indian ocean 
the ship remained anchored saturday in international waters off 
singapore police here and in neighboring malaysia said it arrived 
in the area earlier this week 
a spokesman for the port of singapore authority said on condition 
of anonymity that the vessel had unloaded its cargo but would not be 
allowed to enter port anyway the immigration department says it 
wants to change crews 
reporters who visited the ship thursday confirmed that its four 
holds looked empty 
while many ships are involved in carrying poisonous wastes the 
epic voyage of the pelicano has come to symbolize the problems of 
toxic dumping particularly in the third world 
the ship formerly called the khian sea left philadelphia on 
aug 31 1986 with 14000 tons of the citys municipal and 
industrial incinerator ash it was renamed the felicia last july and 
recast as the pelicano last week according to published reports and 
shipping sources 
at least 11 countries on four continents have spurned the toxic 
waste the boat initially wandered the caribbean for 18 months 
reportedly leaving up to 4500 tons of ash in haiti before making an 
unsuccessful attempt to enter delaware bay its later travels took 
it across the atlantic to west africa the mediterranean and the 
indian ocean 
it is said to have been registered in liberia bahama and 
honduras at various times 
a report by the us environmental protection agency said the 
cargo contained aluminum arsenic chromium copper lead mercury 
nickel zinc and toxic dioxins contained in ash from a philadelphia 
city incinerator 
greenpeace spokeswoman uta bellion has said her group learned 
from shipping sources that the vessel dropped its remaining ash into 
the indian ocean she gave no details 
a man who identified himself as capt arturo fuentes denied that 
the ash which he said was nontoxic was dumped at sea he told 
reporters who visited the ship thursday that the pelican unloaded it 
in port but refused to say in what country 
i do not know what they did with the ash said fuentes 
greenpeace estimates that at least 11 developing countries have 
accepted waste from the united states and europe since 1986 the epa 
says about 22 million tons of toxic garbage cross international 
borders each year

the united states has rejected palestine 
liberation organization chairman yasser arafats application for a 
visa to visit the united states to address the united nations the 
state department announced saturday 
secretary of state george shultz revealed his decision in a 
twopage statement issued to reporters 
the plo applied for a visa so arafat could travel to new york to 
address the un general assembly on dec 1 when it opens its debate 
on the palestine questions 
shultz said he could not recommend granting the visa to arafat 
because of the plos positions 
the us government has convincing evidence that plo elements 
have engaged in terrorism against americans and others the 
statement said moreover arafat as plo chairman knows of 
condones and lends support to such acts and is an accessory to 
such terrorism 
arafat visiting amman jordan on a middle east tour would have 
no comment until after he read the text of the state departments 
statement said bassam abu sharif a spokesman with the plo leader 
but abu sharif told reporters the united states had made a big 
mistake by breaching the agreement between the united nations as 
an institution and the united states government 
in new york nasser alkidwa the plos second top representative 
to the un called the decision another clear violation of the 
1947 host country headquarters agreement to allow un diplomats and 
guests to come and go freely 
he said he thinks virtually all un member nations will support 
the plo position to hold a special session of the general assembly 
in another place such as geneva or vienna in order to give arafat a 
chance to address it 
in jerusalem israeli foreign minister shimon peres praised the 
us decision sending a telegram of appreciation to shultz 
according to a spokesman for peres 
a spokeswoman for un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said he would not comment on shultz decision until after reading a 
text of the state department statement 
when the plo applied for the visa earlier this week state 
department spokesman charles redman said the united states would 
severely scrutinize arafats application 
the us government has been under intense domestic pressure from 
jewish leaders and others to deny a visa to arafat jewish groups 
praised the departments decision but arabamericans condemned it 
the whole civilized world was shocked when he wore a gun upon 
last addressing the united nations and we see no reason to think 
that he is any less supportive of terrorism or any less an enemy of 
israel than he was then said ira silverman executive vice 
president of the american jewish committee 
james abourezk chairman of the americanarab antidiscrimination 
committee said it is embarrassing and shameful that shultz 
would allow israel to dictate whom the american people can or 
cannot hear 
presidentelect george bush asked about the visa while jogging 
in kennebunkport maine said no comment 
white house spokesman ben jarrett in santa barbara calif 
where president reagan is vacationing said reagan was aware of the 
state departments decision but had no role in it 
shortly before shultz announced his decision arafat said in 
kuwait that he would call for the un debate on palestinian issues 
to be moved to geneva if the united states rejected his visa to 
visit new york 
there was no immediate indication from un officials on arafats 
call to move the proceedings arafat who is on a tour of the arab 
nations to gain support for an independent palestinian state last 
addressed the united nations in 1974 
shultz statement spelled out the relationship between the united 
states and the new yorkbased united nations the united states is 
obligated by the 1947 un headquarters agreement to allow people to 
enter the united states on un business 
but congress has stipulated that the united states has the right 
to bar entry to aliens to safeguard the nations security in this 
regard us law excludes members of the plo from entering the 
united states because the organization engages in terrorism 
however the plo has observer status at the un and some of its 
members have routinely been granted visa waivers the department 
said 
the plo therefore has had and continues to have ample 
opportunity to make its positions known to the membership of the 
united nations it said 
earlier this year congress passed legislation to close the plos 
observer mission at the un but the measure was overturned by a 
federal court 
lawrence schilling an attorney who represented the plo in the 
observer mission case called shultz decision unwise and said he 
would not rule out a similar court challenge on the denial of a visa 
to arafat 
there can be no reasonable claim that mr arafat represents any 
kind of security problem and his visit to the united nations is very 
much in the interest of peace schilling said in an interview from 
his new york office 
clovis maksoud the league of arab states ambassador to the 
united states said his organization would join arafats call to 
move the un debate on palestine issues to a more accomodating 
venue 
maksoud said the reasoning offered by shultz renders us 
policy on the palestinian question hostage to israeli idocyncricies 
responsive to israeli false allegations and in tandem with israels 
priorities and annexationist designs 
it is now for the un to salvage the credibility of its 
resolutions the integrity of its deliberations and the reputation 
of its enhanced stature he said 
the state department listed terrorist incidents linked to the 
plo but said the united states firmly believes that palestinian 
political rights must be recognized and addressed 
it also praised the outcome of the recent palestine national 
council meeting in algiers in which the pnc the plos 
parliamentinexile for the first time implicitly recognized 
israels right to exist 
however barukh binah a spokesman for the israeli un mission 
maintains that the plos convenant still calls for the destruction 
of israel and that the plo has never accepted un resolutions 242 
and 338 which recognize israels right to exist 
the state department statement on the visa denial said the pnc 
session produced signs that there are palestinians trying to move 
the plo in a constructive way 
this is encouraging and should continue it said it is 
unfortunate that the blight of terrorism still afflicts the 
palestinian cause and leaves no alternative to decisions such as the 
secretary has taken today 
as evidence of the plos ties to terrorism the department cited 
the presence at the pnc session in algiers of abu abbas a member of 
the plos executive committee who has been convicted in italy of 
murdering leon klinghoffer an american tourist killed aboard the 
cruise ship achille lauro in the mediterranean in 1985 
it also said that force 17 and the hawari organizations 
offshoots of the plo have engaged in terrorist operations since the 
plo renounced terrorism in cairo in november 1985 
as for longterm prospects in the middle east the department 
said palestinian participation is required at every stage to bring 
about a settlement of the arabisraeli conflict significant 
progress has already been achieved it said all participants 
must renounce violence and terrorism 
the pnc has proclaimed the palestinian state in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip and at least 20 nations 
but not the united states have subsequently recognized that claim

palestine liberation organization officials 
on saturday accused the united states of violating international law 
by forbidding plo leader yasser arafat to visit the united nations 
headquarters in new york 
bassam abu sharif chief spokesman for arafat told reporters the 
united states had made a big mistake by breaching the agreement 
between the united nations as an institution and the united 
states government 
abu sharif made the statement a few hours after arafat arrived in 
amman from baghdad on a middle east tour 
abu sharif said arafat would not comment on the us move until 
he had read a text of the state department refusal to issue him a 
visa to enter the united states 
abu sharif said the plo has a lot of friends in the un and 
would take all steps necessary to address the united nations 
session 
prime minister zaid rifai met arafat on arrival in amman and 
later visited him for about 30 minutes at the heavily guarded 
government guest palace in the capital 
plo officials filed the visa request on friday with the us 
consulate in tunis tunisia where the plo has its headquarters on 
saturday secretary of state george p shultz announced in 
washington that arafats application was rejected because of the 
plos positions 
the plo had requested the visa so arafat could travel to new york

nadia younes spokeswoman for un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar said there would be no immediate comment until un

the united nations said such a us position constitutes a 
direct strike against the peace process in the middle east and 
against any attempt to achieve peace 
arafats aides have been referring to the upcoming address as a 
matter of fact earlier this week a plo spokesman said arafat would 
use the speech to ask the general assembly to grant the new 
palestinian state un membership 
the plo was granted un observer status in 1974 following 
arafats last address before the assembly in august the reagan 
administration lost a legal battle to close the plos unmissionon 
grounds the plo endorses terrorism 
shortly before shultz announced his decision arafat said in 
kuwait that he would call for the un debate on palestinian issues 
to be moved to geneva if the united states rejected his visa to 
visit new york 
there was no immediate reaction from un officials on arafats 
call for the proceedings to be moved

the wedding was a success but the video 
was a flop so claire lockett and michael narramore reassembled the 
cast of hundreds put their wedding finery back and staged a remake 
of the big moment on saturday 
despite five hours of shooting the videotape of the original 
wedding two months ago amounted to only eight usable minutes of 
distinctly patchy quality 
rita lockett was so disappointed not to have a video record of 
her daughters big day that she spent 18500 for a repeat 
performance skipping only the ceremony itself 
a fleet of limousines took family and friends from the church in 
the south coast resort town to the fivestar imperial hotel for a 
glittering reception for 200 guests just as before 
everyone wore exactly the same outfits sat in precisely the same 
positions and made identical speeches 
this time they entrusted the filming to an expert and were 
counting on a better result 
there were several tv cameras there as well 
so we will be ending up with the best wedding video of all 
time said mrs lockett

sons bedrooms leading to the arrest of one of the teenagers and 
confiscation of cocaine from both police said

substance with intent to distribute and was being held at boys

dresser drawer police did not immediately make an arrest in that 
case landrum said

the outskirts of the city a newspaper reported saturday

nausea dizziness swelling and pain but none became seriously ill 
the newspaper barricada said

however one radio caller said such attacks are frequent in the 
countryside especially in the western part of this central american 
country 
the bees descended from south african bees that escaped from a 
brazilian researcher in 1956 are an especially aggressive strain 
that produces less honey in central and south america africanized 
bees have largely displaced european bees which are used for 
commercial honeymaking

pope john paul ii met saturday with libyas 
secondincommand and said he prays every day for libyan leader col 
moammar gadhafi 
the pope met for 30 minutes in his private library with 
staffmaj abdulsalam jalloud who is on an official visit to italy 
the meeting was listed as a private audience and the vatican 
released no details of the talks 
a lebanese prelate from the vaticans secretariat of state acted 
as interpreter for the talks afterwards the pope posed for 
photographs with jalloud and libyas ambassador to italy abdel 
rahman shalgam and presented the libyans with pontifical medals 
every day i pray for libya especially for president gadhafi 
john paul told his guests thank you for coming i bless the 
libyan people 
the libyan official who arrived a few minutes late received a 
lowkey welcome the pope did not come out of his study to greet him 
as he often does with visitors 
it was the popes third meeting with jalloud at the vatican after 
previous visits in may 1982 and december 1984 
the holy see does not have formal diplomatic relations with 
libya but since 1986 the pope has had a representative for libya 
based in algiers archbishop giovanni de andrea 
jalloud is the highestranking libyan official to make an 
official visit to italy since libya fired a missile at the tiny 
italian island of lampedusa in april 1986 
the missile which fell harmlessly in the sea was launched a few 
hours after the us bombing raids on two libyan cities 
jalloud met thursday and friday with several highranking 
offficials including premier ciriaco de mita president francesco 
cossiga and foreign minister giulio andreotti 
his trip is seen as part of a libyan effort to break out of 
international isolation improve relations with the west and expand 
economic ties with european countries 
italy which depends greatly on libya oil is libyas largest 
trading partner

britain is asking the republic of ireland to 
extradite a roman catholic priest suspected of ira crimes police 
said saturday a day after belgium freed him to fly home to dublin 
patrick ryan was freed from a belgian jail friday after a 
threeweek hunger strike in a decision that stirred anger among 
british officials 
in london legislator terry dicks of the governing conservative 
party said it is shameful that the belgian government should 
behave in this way 
in the britishruled province of northern ireland however 
supporters of the outlawed irish republican army cheered the 
priests freedom 
in belfast gerry adams president of the iras political wing 
known as sinn fein told a rally father ryan like countless 
other irish nationals before him had been found guilty by the 
british media before he had even set foot in an english court being 
irish meant he was guilty 
belgian authorities arrested ryan on june 30 during a raid on a 
brussels apartment city police were quoted as saying the apartment 
contained manuals on bombmaking 
ryan was said to have traveled from spain to belgium on a false 
passport he initially asked for political asylum in belgium 
british authorities initiated moves to extradite ryan from 
belgium accusing him of conspiracy to murder and causing bomb 
attacks in crimes dating back to 1975 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in mostly protestant 
northern ireland and unite it with the republic of ireland which is 
95 percent catholic 
belgian prime minister wilfried martens government announcing 
its decision to free ryan said the facts provided by british 
authorities were imprecise and lacked the elements of the 
punishable offense of gangforming required by belgian law he was 
flown to dublin aboard a belgian military airplane

authorities worked saturday to clean up a 
freight train derailment that released a poisonous fertilizer 
forcing the evacuation of more than 250 residents and sending two 
motorists to a hospital 
one witness said the 89car union pacific train might have been 
hit by a tornado causing 35 of its cars to derail though a tornado 
was reported to have landed in this tiny east texas town at the 
time authorities said they were uncertain what caused the accident 
about 730 pm friday during a heavy thunderstorm 
more than threequarters of one tank cars 30000 gallons of 
anhydrous ammonia spilled and the cleanup was continuing 24 hours 
later officials said 
anhydrous ammonia is shipped as a liquid but a puncture would 
cause a gas cloud john bromley a spokesman at the railroads 
omaha neb headquarters said 
its a fertilizer what farmers put on their fields bromley 
said 
capt david schlottach of the tyler fire department hazardous 
materials response team estimated 6000 to 7000 gallons had to be 
drained from the car before the cleanup could begin 
environmental workers and hazardous waste handlers drained the 
ammonia into a pit they dug near the wreckage there they planned to 
neutralize it pumping in air and then water to create ammonium 
hydroxide which could be vacuumed into storage trucks schlottach 
said 
another car carrying the fertilizer and one carrying chlorine 
which also is hazardous were not leaking said alex tice the 
railroads regional director for public relations 
the train derailed about onehalf mile west of the community of 
400 which is about 70 miles east of dallas authorities closed two 
nearby roads and evacuated residents within one mile to the north 
and threefourths of a mile to the south as a precaution said 
schlottach 
the trains fourmember crew was not injured said tice however 
two people who were driving near the derailment were overcome by 
ammonia fumes and taken to terrell community hospital an emergency 
room supervisor said the two were kept overnight but were not 
seriously injured 
the rev tom pesnell said 45 to 50 of the evacuees were staying 
at his main street baptist church in nearby grand saline 
there are some that have gone to stay with their various 
families there are some staying in motels he added 
james boyd whose home is about a third of a mile from the 
derailment said what he believed was a tornado toppled 15 to 20 
cars on highway 80 
it knocked down trees toppled our tv antenna he said 
don travis superintendent of the fruitvale school district said 
he was driving along highway 80 when he saw a train on the tracks 
and his eyes began to burn 
we were driving and could smell the ammonia really well he 
said 
the weather was real bad said travis while i was driving 
there was real strong wind and some hail i had to move a tree out 
of the road at one point

about 3000 people marched silently at 
a roman catholic church saturday to demand the ouster of a new 
pastor that the town council has accused of ignoring human rights 
abuses 
im not going to send any of my kids to that church for 
confession before someone who is capable of crucifying christ 
said marta de la torre a 40yearold housewife 
the rev christian von wernich was leading a mass for about 300 
people inside while the protesters marched outside 
the 16member council that governs this town of 40000 declared 
von wernich unwelcome and last week asked the church to remove him 
the community of bragado is not confronting the wise and 
ancient church only one of its priests who by action or inaction 
lost his good reputation during the dark years of repression the 
council said in a statement issued saturday 
von wernich a 50yearold balding man with a stern demeanor 
drove into this prosperous farm community about 125 miles west of 
buenos aires on nov 17 
he was met at the door of santa rosa de lima church by about 500 
people some shouted murderer murderer and others carried 
placards that said we dont want torturers 
the heart of the complaints against von wernich is that as 
chaplain for the buenos aires provincial police during the late 
1970s he visited detention centers where hundreds of young 
argentines were tortured and killed yet his critics say he never 
denounced the police 
the military and security forces at that time were trying to 
stamp out an urban guerrilla movement 
during the dictatorship that followed the overthrow of president 
isabel peron in 1976 an estimated 9000 argentines disappeared and 
were presumed executed according to a government commission 
appointed by president raul alfonsin 
argentina was ruled by three military juntas between mrs perons 
ouster and alfonsins election in october 1983 
von wernich until earlier this month served in the smaller 
community of norberto de la riestra north of bragado 
he has in the past denied the accusations of his detractors 
during the past week he has refused to comment to reporters 
von wernich has his supporters attorney sergio tente said he 
thinks the priest is being unfairly persecuted and those doing so 
should be excommunicated from the catholic church 
but many others side with jose idiart 57 whose daughter was 
arrested by security forces and never seen again 
idiart said von wernich told the family on several occasions that 
their daughter was well and would return she never did 
its clear that von wernich shielded himself behind his cassock 
to collaborate with murderers idiart said 
so far the church has backed the priest however bishop 
jeronimo podesta hinted that it might transfer him saying a 
priest repudiated by his flock cannot be their pastor

troops battled leftist guerrillas in a 
remote area east of bogota on saturday and 19 rebels and a soldier 
were killed a military commander said 
the battle broke out after soldiers discovered the guerrilla camp 
in the sierra de la mararena region in the remote eastern plains 
150 miles east of bogota gen rafael padilla vergara commander of 
the armys 2nd division said on the rcn radio 
he said the army found a clandestine landing strip and coca 
plants from which cocaine is cultivated a sign the colombian 
revolutionary armed forces guerrillas and cocaine traffickers were 
working together in the area 
he said the soldiers also found an arms cache that had once 
belonged to the colombian army he did not say whether the weapons 
had been stolen or captured 
colombian guerrillas often forge alliances with drug traffickers 
providing protection to the drug runners for a share of the huge 
profits 
probably the landing strip is used for the transport of arms 
with the destination to guerrillas and the export of cocaine grown 
in this region padilla vergara said 
the attack was the first since president virgilio barco announced 
emergency measures friday to fight leftist rebels rightwing 
paramilitary groups and drug traffickers 
barco promised to increase the security forces and stiffen 
penalties for terroristrelated killings 
colombian rebel armies have an estimated 10000 members and are 
blamed for more than 2000 deaths and nearly 500 kidnappings this 
year alone

presidentelect george bush should make a top 
priority of slashing aid to farmers particularly those subsidies 
that reward farmers for high production the conservative heritage 
foundation think tank said

believed and should be forced to operate in a more competitive 
environment with fewer government handouts

help american farmers break out of a cycle of dependence on 
federal subsidies charles grizzle wrote in the heritage 
foundations forthcoming policy guidebook grizzle a former senior 
official in the agriculture department said the key to weaning 
farmers from government aid is to decouple subsidy programs from 
production requirements
