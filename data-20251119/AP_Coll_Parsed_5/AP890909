supreme court justice thurgood marshall told a 
group of federal judges friday that recent high court decisions are 
a risk to the civil rights of all citizens not just the rights of 
minorities 
marshall said the court has come full circle back to the days 
before its 1954 decision in brown vs board of education ended an 
era of legal segregation the new york times reported in its 
saturday editions 
marshall made his remarks in bolton landing ny at an annual 
meeting of federal judges from new york connecticut and vermont he 
is the liaison officer for the judicial circuit in those states 
it is difficult to characterize last terms decisions as the 
product of anything other than a deliberate retrenching of the civil 
rights agenda marshall said 
marshall dissented on several court rulings last term including 
decisions that make it more difficult to win lawsuits for employment 
discrimination 
marshall said a restrictive approach to the rights of minorities 
coincided with similar restrictions on the constitutional rights of 
other groups such as political dissenters 
he said he feared that the rulings last term might pave the way 
for the lowering of constitutional barriers separating church and 
state 
referring to the courts change in its approach to civil rights 
marshall said we could sweep it under the rug and hide it but 
im not going to do it 
marshall was concerned about the expansiveness of the courts 
holdings saying the court majority had gone beyond legal boundaries 
of issues before the court to reach broad and wholly unnecessary 
conclusions

beethoven was deaf when he composed some of his 
greatest works carmelo gannello who is legally blind and tom 
woodward a quadriplegic also havent let their disabilities stifle 
their creativity 
their artworks appear in imagination without barriers iii an 
exhibition of works by professional disabled artists from around the 
country that opened friday 
the disabled within the boundaries of their own imagination 
really have no barriers said kathleen yosko vice president and 
administrator of chicagos schwab rehabilitation center which is 
sponsoring the exhibition 
schwab organized its first disabled artists exhibition in 1987 to 
help commemorate its 75th anniversary drawing about 70 entries 
this year a jury chose 46 works by 43 disabled artists from about 
250 entries 
there are also nine invited works by more prominent artists with 
disabilities including a lithograph by the late french painter 
henri matisse who worked from a wheelchair in his later years 
some of the artists have been inspired by their disabilities but 
for others their art has come in spite of their ailments 
dw lundahl 40 a polio victim from beloit wis is 
represented by walking wounded a set of three twisted welded 
brass figures with straight crutches 
with this exhibition i celebrate my physical difference 
lundahl wrote in the exhibits catalogue by acknowledging the 
impact that wearing a metal brace has had on my world view i turn 
adversity to affirmation 
gannello 69 of oak park ill has suffered from detached 
retinas for 35 years forced by blindness to quit work as a 
commercial artist 20 years ago he sells some of his work but lives 
on social security and disability payments 
gannellos linocut eagle eye features a large e from an 
eyechart exam with two eyes in the background filled with 
concentric blackandwhite circles of varying sizes representing 
what he calls the floaters he sees constantly 
i call it art of the eye gannello said in a telephone 
interview i want to show people how carmelo sees the world with 
his low vision 
woodward 40 has been battling his disability ever since a 1968 
automobile accident left him a quadriplegic he was an arts major in 
college then 
woodward who makes a living from his art taught himself to draw 
by weaving a pencil through his fingers using his shoulder for big 
strokes and manipulating his arm for finer work 
it was a matter of training my large muscles to do the motor 
work smaller muscles used to do woodward said from his home in 
opelika ala the technique was just born out of my disability 
woodward is represented by one of his graphite pencil drawings 
early october which has a grainy photolike quality shows a 
woman lying in a bed 
ms yosko says one aim of the exhibition is to open opportunities 
for disabled artists the show moved this year from the schwab 
center to a gallery in the citys river north art district where it 
be until sept 29 
the exhibit includes photographs oil paintings mixed media 
creations metal sculptures pottery and pencil sketches 
the artworks will be sold at public auction with the proceeds 
to be split between the artists and the nonprofit private 
rehabilitation center last year the auction and a benefit evening 
raised 61000 overall including 11000 for the artists ms yosko

forest hill high school can keep the 
nickname rebels and the old colonel cartoon mascot but the 
rebel flag is out 
we are phasing out the rebel flag because some groups feel 
it is offensive principal ennis proctor said thursday

altogether proctor said forest hill has got a lot of pride and 
a lot of good kids weve got a lot of other good things going on to 
get too upset over this 
school board president ollye shirley said before classes started 
this year that she was offended by the confederate symbols 
students at forest hill said they were surprised when proctor 
announced the ban a week ago forest hills 1000member student

prime minister yitzhak shamir insists his peace 
initiative is not dead but in the five months since he announced it 
the plan has only fostered divisions among both palestinians and 
israelis 
just this week the proposal caused arguments within the 
leftleaning labor party and a squabble between shamir and labor 
leader shimon peres it also led to public criticism by shamir of a 
member of his own likud bloc foreign minister moshe arens 
all the arguments started with doves in the labor party declaring 
that shamirs peace initiative was stalled and might die if 
something wasnt done to save it 
they are wrong shamir said in an interview published friday 
in the jerusalem post it was an illusion to think that such an 
initiative can produce results in such a sort time of a few 
weeks a few months 
he said he was still awaiting a positive response from 
palestinians in the occupied territories and from arab nations to 
his call for elections among palestinians as a first step toward 
negotiations on the final status of the occupied lands 
but the arguments over his plan struck at what was supposed to be 
its strength other than the elections the plan offers nothing 
specific to the palestinians who have carried on a revolt for 
nearly 21 months against israeli occupation 
the plans vagueness was designed to make it acceptable to both 
sides of israels coalition government shamirs rightwing likud 
and centerleft labor this worked and the cabinet accepted the 
plan on may 14 
but palestinians immediately demanded that the elections lead 
eventually to an independent palestinian state in the west bank and 
gaza strip which israel captured from egypt and jordan in the 1967 
middle east war 
they also insisted the palestine liberation organization which 
israel considers a terrorist group be part of any peace talks 
israel asked egyptian president hosni mubaraks help in gaining 
palestinian support but he first wanted answers to 10 questions 
about the israeli initiative 
two of these touched on the very points that divide israels 
cabinet will israel give up occupied land to achieve peace will it 
allow the 140000 arabs in east jerusalem to vote 
likud refuses to give up any occupied land and rejects giving the 
vote to arabs in east jerusalem which was annexed by israel after 
its capture in 1967 labor accepts the usbacked formula of trading 
land for peace and maintains east jerusalem arabs should cast 
ballots but outside the city this weeks arguments within labor 
among the partys hawks and doves have been over just these points 
for his part shamir wants no specifics added to the election 
proposal 
to head off a challenge from the farright in likud he accepted 
a party resolution rejecting land in exchange for peace and any vote 
for east jerusalem arabs but he insisted this did not change his 
proposal 
on friday in his post interview shamir chastised foreign 
minister arens for suggesting the refusal to allow the vote in east 
jerusalem was official policy this doesnt mean anything he 
said of arens statement 
the prime minister however is under increasing pressure to 
provide more specifics to entice palestinians into elections 
labor doves referred to mubaraks 10 questions in their demand to 
get the peace plan moving sources in washington also said the us 
government may use the egyptian presidents plan to press shamir to 
be specific 
the prime minister shows no signs of giving in however he said 
thursday on israels arab television channel he was willing to wait 
a long time for palestinians to accept his initiative as it stands 
they will not see another plan proposed by us or any change in 
the plan shamir said there can be 10 points or 20 points but 
i see nothing to this 
there is no question of a time limit he added that would 
be ridiculous

stop criticizing the style of britains new 
buildings and take a closer look at why british cities are so 
decrepit and ugly leading architects are telling prince charles 
attacks on architects in an almost physical way are not 
conducive to sitting down and getting to the next stage peter 
carolin professor of architectureelect at cambridge university 
said friday 
his challenge closed out a week in which modern architecture was 
frontpage news with the heir to the throne having a book published 
that dismissed some modern british buildings as frankenstein 
monsters 
two of charles targets took advantage of an offer to reply made 
by british broadcasting corps national television network 
one was sir denys lasdun whose national theater the prince 
compared to a nuclear power station in the middle of london 
lasdun defended his concrete construction and compared its wide 
interior spaces with the great amphitheaters of ancient greece 
critics were looking too much at the outsides of buildings and not 
enough at the comfort and pleasure within he said 
the second target was colin st john wilson the prince likened 
his redbrick british library now under construction to a secret 
police headquarters 
wilson said he had related the library to its neighbor the 
victorian train station of st pancras and to the local housing 
and had done everything to give readers natural daylight for their 
studies 
the architects argued that britain gets ugly buildings and dreary 
cities because it is too mean to want buildings of beauty 
preferring the job done fast and cheap they said the culprits are 
usually developers and accountants looking for quick profits 
the prince has been campaigning for five years for better 
buildings and an improved environment his book a vision of 
britain sets out his 10 principles to govern building design 
they include harmony with the surroundings a human scale and use of 
local materials 
the prince likes classicalstyle buildings with decoration his 
opponents say buildings must reflect their time 
many architects resent the high public profile given to charles 
criticisms because of his privileged position but the profession 
congratulated him on starting a great public debate 
carolin said i hope the prince will now stop talking so much 
about purely superficial stylistic issues we have got to turn 
to the things that really influence our society the quality of 
life the prosperity of our cities and from that the prosperity of 
the nation 
maxwell hutchinson president of the royal institute of british 
architects said the problem was not just all that office space 
which charles condemns for scarring the london skyline but the 1 
million homes in this country unfit for human habitation 
richard rogers britains leading hightechnology architect 
contrasted london unfavorably with paris 
paris has a center the pavillon de larsenal where the public 
can inspect designs for the hundreds of building projects in the 
french capital as it seeks to become the economic and cultural 
powerhouse of europe after the creation in 1992 of a single market 
for the 12nation european economic community 
winning the commercial battle for 1992 is a matter of life and 
death said rogers who designed the pompidou arts center in paris 
and the soaring lloyds building in londons city financial district 
london is in danger of losing its advantages and slipping its 
position he said it is not trying hard enough to improve 
itself to think about what kind of city it ought to be to make 
itself attractive to the japanese the americans the europeans and 
of course to its citizens 
we have forgotten the art of creating cities we dont think 
enough about the way we want to live

energy secretary james d watkins is sending 
teams of federal inspectors to nuclear weapons plants in tennessee 
texas and ohio to check compliance with environmental health and 
safety rules 
the investigations are part of a broader effort by watkins to 
identify potentially debilitating problems at the 17 major weapons 
plants owned by the department and to try to reassure congress that 
flaws are being corrected 
the department was embarrassed earlier this summer by a surprise 
fbi raid on the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant in colorado the 
fbi checked out allegations of improper and illegal handling of 
wastes at the site 
the criminal investigation has gone to a grand jury but no 
charges have resulted 
the plants earmarked for special doe investigations are the 
pantex weapons assembly plant at amarillo texas the y12 plant in 
oak ridge tenn which makes uranium and other nuclear materials 
and the mound plant near dayton ohio which produces detonators and 
other components for nuclear weapons 
in announcing the inspections watkins did not say whether any 
environmental or safety violations were suspected at any of the 
three weapons plants 
he also gave no specific date for the start of the inspections 
expected to begin later this month but said they would take place 
over a fiveweek period inspectors from the occupational safety and 
health administration will participate in the assessments and 
officials from the states involved will be invited to observe he 
said 
in july watkins sent groups of federal inspectors to a nuclear 
facility in west valley ny and a uranium processing center at 
fernald ohio results of those environmental and safety 
investigations have not been disclosed 
watkins said special inspections of all 18 major federal nuclear 
weapons facilities would be completed by june 30 
new doubts about the departments commitment to safety were 
raised friday by environmentalists and arms control experts who 
questioned watkins decision to restart an aging nuclear weapons 
reactor in south carolina before all safety issues are settled 
watkins announced thursday that the savannah river reactor near 
aiken sc would begin lowpower testing late next summer and then 
enter production by years end the reactor has been shut down for 
more than a year for safety reasons 
the department is studying the environmental impact of a savannah 
river restart but it has refused to promise to complete the work 
before firing up the reactor 
david albright senior staff scientist at the federation of 
american scientists said in a telephone interview friday that 
watkins appeared to have caved in to pressure from the pentagon to 
get the reactor running as soon as possible the facility is the 
only source of tritium a perishable gas needed to make nuclear 
warheads 
its tiring to see watkins confusing our national security with 
making the defense department angry albright said 
paul leventhal president of the nuclear control institute which 
specializes in nuclear nonproliferation issues said there was no 
need to resume tritium production even if the savannah river plant 
were determined to be entirely safe 
there is no crisis in tritium supply for nuclear warheads that 
justifies premature restart at savannah river leventhal said 
watkins has provided few details about the reactor restart plan 
and westinghouse savannah river co which operates the plant for 
the energy department has said little about the project 
becky apter a westinghouse spokeswoman at the plant site said 
friday no officials were available to discuss the matter

the somali army deliberately killed at least 
5000 unarmed civilians in the 10 months preceding last march 
according to a report given to the state department 
the report said the army killed 500 men of the isaak clan most 
of whom died with their throats cut and buried them in a mass 
grave according to an account of the report published saturday by 
the new york times in a dispatch from nairobi kenya 
a us official speaking to the associated press on condition of 
anonymity said the report prepared by robert gersony an outside 
consultant to the state department placed the overall death toll in 
somalia between 5000 and 10000 although it estimated that the 
number probably is closer to the lower end of that range 
the somali government has denied the killings the times reported 
the somali government has repeatedly been accused of human rights 
abuses including one incident this summer in which 46 men were 
reported to have been summarily executed by the army after moslem 
rioting that left 400 people dead 
the human rights group africa watch and other independent sources 
said the people were killed after somali soldiers started shooting 
at houses in mogadishu the nations capital 
gersonys report was based on more than 250 interviews with 
somali refugees the times reported 
the united states recently suspended 25 million in military aid 
and 21 million in econimic aid to somalia to express objection to 
that governments human rights abuses the times said

the food and drug administration and the 
nations paper industry say cancercausing dioxins in milk cartons 
are being reduced to a virtually untraceable level 
we expect that dioxin contamination of paper milk cartons 
will be effectively eliminated in the very near future james s 
benson the fdas acting deputy administrator told a house panel 
friday 
they havent finished the job but theyre definitely moving in 
that direction 
the house energy and commerce subcommittee on health and the 
environment was told that only one of the six us paper mills that 
make the cartons the potlatch corp mill at lewiston idaho is 
still making polyethylenecoated cardboard with traces of dioxin 
high enough to measurably contaminate milk 
dioxin is the most potent carcinogenic chemical compound ever 
tested in laboratory animals although it has never been shown to 
cause cancer in humans 
red cavaney president of the american paper institute said 
potlatch had reduced the dioxin level of its milk cartons by 46 
percent in the last year and that the five other plants had cut it 
by as much as 90 percent 
the fda reported last week that tests indicated that dioxin had 
leached into milk from four of 15 sampled halfpint cartons produced 
by the six mills 
benson estimated the risk of getting cancer from drinking milk 
from dioxincontaminated milk cartons over a lifetime at less than 5 
in 1 million 
subcommittee chairman henry a waxman dcalif said he wouldnt 
be satisfied until all avoidable dioxin had been eliminated from 
milk cartons as well as a wide variety of other paper products 
including disposable diapers toilet paper coffee filters tea bags 
and tv dinners 
there is continuing scientific disagreement over some 
characteristics of the dioxin risk but no one believes that 
avoidable exposure to dioxin is acceptable waxman said 
benson said the fda had not completed its studies into the 
possible migration of dioxin traces from other paper products into 
food 
we believe the manufacturing changes now in progress will 
reduce if not eliminate this source of these compounds in food 
he said we thought milk was the most important so thats why we 
started there 
dioxin makes its way into paper products through chlorine 
bleaching to whiten and strengthen the material 
dixon has never been shown to have caused cancer in humans but 
the animal studies have raised concerns among scientists in high 
doses dioxin has been proved to cause acne and some studies have 
suggested it can also contribute to reproductive disorders 
cavaney said laboratory tests of milk carton samples taken from 
the six mills in early summer showed only the potlatch plants board 
had a dioxin level above the measurable threshold of 2 parts per 
trillion 
the plant he said is in the midst of a 145 million improvement 
program to reduce the dioxin traces to well below the threshold by 
the end of 1990 
samples from international paper cos plant at texarkana texas 
measured at 2 ppt cavaney said adding that the changes being made 
in its production methods will reduce the dioxin content of its 
paper milk cartons to below the threshold by the end of this year 
cavaney said the four mills producing 75 percent of the nations 
paper cartons with dioxin contents too low to cause any measurable 
contamination are international paper at pine bluff ark a 
weyerhaeuser co facility at longview wash champion international 
corps canton nc plant and westvaco corps plant at

pressure to achieve rapid school reform is 
prompting some educators to help students cheat on standardized 
achievement tests a report charges 
the problem is worsened by totally inadequate test security 
in nearly every state concludes the lake wobegon report how 
public educators cheat on achievement tests 
the report says cheating is contributing to misleadingly high 
scores on the most widely used standardized achievement tests in 
grade schools making it seem in thousands of districts like all 
the children are above average as in author garrison keillors 
mythical minnesota town of lake wobegon 
the associated press obtained a draft of the report which was 
conducted by friends for education a watchdog group headed by 
albuquerque nm physician john jacob cannell the kettering 
family foundation in dayton ohio financed it with a 25000 grant 
all but two states louisiana and arizona are reporting 
aboveaverage scores according to the 50state survey those states 
recently started using new tests 
eightythree percent of 5143 elementary school districts and 73 
percent of 4501 secondary districts surveyed are reporting 
standardized achievement test scores above national norms according 
to the report 
high achievement test scores have misled many into believing that 
although the nations schools may be at risk their own schools are 
improving each year the report said 
the cheating includes teachers and principals coaching students 
on test questions giving students more than the allotted time to 
take tests and even altering answer sheets 
many states have added new standardized test requirements in 
recent years as part of the school reform effort in some states 
educators careers can now be made or broken and school districts 
can even be subject to state takeover partly on the strength of test 
scores 
the report placed the blame for cheating not so much on teachers 
or principals but on the pressures for educational quick fixes by 
parents politicians and the media 
these tests that were once used only as instructional aids now 
assess class achievement school achievement and district 
achievement through students scores the report said as such 
the class results then become the teachers scores the schools 
results become the principals score and the districts results 
become the superintendents score 
cannell said in an interview friday that besides gathering test 
data from all 50 states he placed an ad in the may 3 issue of the 
trade journal education week inviting educators to reveal test 
cheating 
cannell said he received more than 300 letters from teachers 
college professors who once taught grade school and school 
administrators admitting they or collegues had tampered with tests 
or helped students improperly all demanded anonymity 
a tennessee teacher wrote that teachers in his school spent the 
morning teaching the test and the afternoon giving it 
it appears that there are teachers in every school now who 
cheat the teacher wrote the most common way is to teach the 
test 
national education association spokesman howard carroll whose 
organization is the nations largest teacher union said the nea 
hadnt seen the report and couldnt comment on it directly 
we would certainly deplore any cheating by teachers carroll 
added we dont feel its widespread but the report certainly 
indicates this obsessive pressure on schools by the marketplace to 
increase student scores on standardized tests and we deplore that 
scott thomson executive director of the national association of 
secondary school principals said we do have educational 
malpractice lets not kid ourselves just as we have medical 
malpractice 
but he added that its not improper for schools to use old 
versions of a test to help students prepare for a newer version and 
said it was possible some teachers were incorrectly identifying that 
practice as cheating 
cannell first documented that students in all 50 states were 
scoring above average on commercial achievement tests in 1987 
his first report later verified by a us department of 
educationsponsored study asserted that scores on such 
normreferenced tests designed so that only half the students 
taking it should score above the 50th percentile were artificially 
high largely because the norms were not being updated often enough 
by test publishers 
those tests include the california achievement test the stanford 
achievement test the metropolitan achievement test the science 
research associates test the comprehensive test of basic skills 
and the iowa test of basic skills 
test publishers have argued that its expensive to renorm tests 
as frequently as critics like cannell demand and defend their tests 
as useful tools to identify pupil or group strengths and weaknesses 
few states randomly audit test scores to uncover improprieties 
according to the study california one the few that does caught 50 
schools cheating during the last three years on the statewide 
achievement testing program 
according to the report 
only 16 states forbid test administrators to receive tests 
earlier than the day they are to be given four others are 
instituting such guidelines 
six states forbid teachers from reading test booklets seven 
others plan to 
only a dozen states require that test booklets be sealed 
drafts of the report were reviewed this summer by a dozen testing 
authorities child psychiatrists and educators including chester 
finn jr former assistant us education secretary 
finn a professor of education at vanderbilt university called 
the report a constructive and useful piece of work and said he 
agreed with cannell that reporting rosy local scores has 
contributed to a sense of unwarranted contentment at the local and 
state level 
if cannell is right and his track record is such that he 
probably is finn said states are so lax and sloppy in 
organizing test security that its like letting exxon monitor water 
quality in prince william sound

the federal aviation administration will order 
exhaustive inspections of all dc10 engines as a result of a july 
crash in sioux city iowa that killed 112 people an agency 
official says 
anthony broderick faa associate administrator said in an 
interview friday that the agency expects within a few weeks to order 
inspections of the metal in all general electric cf66 engines such 
as those in the dc10 that crashlanded july 19 in sioux city 
broderick said the expected faaordered inspections would take 40 
hours each and could cause some flight disruptions 
however officials say the investigation into the crash is being 
hampered because a large section of the tail engine of united flight 
232 has not been found 
with 8foot corn stalks and 4foot soybean plants obscuring much 
of the ground in the flight path authorities in washington and iowa 
said friday they hope the harvest season will uncover parts vital to 
investigation 
ge has offered a total of 279000 in rewards for all the missing 
parts of the tail engine 
investigators have said they believe the middle engine 
disintegrated severing hydraulic lines that control flight pilots 
relying on engine thrust guided the plane to a crash landing in 
which 184 people survived 
both the search and investigation are focusing on the large 
titanium fan disk which broderick said probably broke into two or 
three pieces rewards total 50000 for the whole 300pound disk 
ge united and american airlines already have begun testing some 
engine fan disks for flaws each test involves sophisticated 
technology using lowfrequency sound waves to probe for cracks the 
size of a pinhead broderick said 
microscopic flaws in the metals crystal structure were detected 
in one disk broderick said the disk had been used on 10000 
flights and the flaws had to have been there since it was 
manufactured he said 
broderick said there was no proof that such flaws caused the iowa 
crash but that it was prudent to check all the cf66 engines for 
any problem that might have caused the revolving disk to break apart 
in flight 
we havent found anything yet that leads us to say aha he 
said and we dont expect to until we find that disk 
ge spokesman david lane said the company had been low key in 
announcing the reward because it doesnt want to cause problems for 
farmers along the flight path an aug 31 deadline for collecting 
reward money has been extended indefinitely he said 
as the farmers get out into the fields with combines and 
tractors we hope more parts will turn up he said 
sheriff chuck eddy of buenavista county iowa said in a 
telephone interview that fields over a 16squaremile area where the 
search has been concentrated are too muddy for much of a search this 
weekend 
only seven aircraft parts have come in since the reward offer 
eddy said 
meanwhile the air transport association announced that a special 
governmentindustry task force on monday will announce results of a 
yearlong look into aging mcdonnell douglas airliners the group is 
expected to make recommendations for mandatory servicing and 
modification of older dc8s dc9s and dc10s 
broderick said the recommendations would focus on structural and 
other problems associated with aging aircraft not on potential 
engine problems

a member of the senate committee reviewing 
evidence in the impeachment case of us district judge walter nixon 
says two days of hearings were a waste of taxpayer money 
the house unanimously voted to impeach nixon on charges of lying 
about his knowledge of a narcotics case involving the son of a 
wealthy businessman who had sold nixon lucrative oil properties 
but sen harry reid dnev said friday that he had not heard 
any evidence indicating that nixon had done anything wrong 
unless i can be convinced otherwise in the next few days i can 
think of very few instances that were a bigger waste of taxpayers 
money reid said 
the judge was convicted by a federal court on the perjury charges 
and is serving a fiveyear prison term but continues to collect his 
89500 annual salary 
sen wyche fowler dga chairman of the 12member committee 
that will summarize the evidence for the full senate said the 
senators would make up their own minds but advised nixons lawyer 
that he didnt need a parade of character witnesses when the 
defense presents its case starting tuesday 
there has been substantial testimony already as to the good 
character of judge nixon by the witnesses called by the house 
fowler said 
the dispute over nixons involvement in the narcotics case 
revolves around whether a conversation he had with the local 
prosecutor constituted a discussion of the case 
the prosecutor paul bud holmes testified that nixon did not 
influence the outcome because he had already arranged a plea bargain 
for the defendant 
nixon told a grand jury he never discussed the case with the 
prosecutor or influenced anyone as to it outcome 
rep don edwards dcalif who is leading the house case against 
nixon said after fridays session that the issue was simply whether 
nixon lied 
this is a perjury case he said weve never pretended it 
was anything else 
the case against nixon as described by witnesses thursday and 
friday began as a probe into his business dealings with wiley 
fairchild 76 a wealthy oil man in hattiesburg miss 
in early 1980 the judge bought interest in wells from fairchild 
with money he borrowed from fairchild to be paid back as the wells 
began to produce 
in august 1980 fairchilds son drew was arrested on charges 
related to marijuana smuggling at the airport where he worked 
drew fairchild arranged a plea bargain with federal authorities 
and avoided prison time but later was indicted by a state grand jury 
the elder fairchild testified thursday that he thought the state 
indictment was an effort by holmes to blackmail him into paying more 
legal fees for his son 
wiley fairchild said he called nixon whom he considered his 
friend because of their oil dealings and complained 
nixon then got together with holmes and according to holmes 
testimony said wiley fairchild had asked him to put in a good 
word for his boy 
since a plea bargain had already been reached holmes said he and 
nixon decided to call wiley fairchild 
according to fairchilds testimony nixon told him over the 
phone everything is going to be handled to your satisfaction 
during holmes testimony early in the day friday reid asked him 
if he and nixon werent simply trying to ingratiate yourselves 
with a rich man in your community by in effect doing nothing for 
him 
holmes said that was right 
the articles of impeachment allege 
nixon lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case 
against drew fairchild with holmes 
nixon lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do 
officially or unofficially with the fairchild case and never 
influenced anyone in the case 
nixon undermined the integrity of the judiciary and 
disobeyed the law by making 14 false or misleading statements during 
an interview with federal investigators and in his sworn grand jury 
testimony

house republican whip newt gingrich says he was 
operating within house rules when he used his congressional staff to 
perform clerical work on a book he wrote in 1984 
what we did was entirely precisely appropriate the georgia 
republican said friday in response to allegations made by a former 
staffer in the october issue of the magazine mother jones 
in the magazine article dolores adamson said she resigned from 
gingrichs district staff in 1983 after returning from a vacation to 
find that gingrich had put the district office staff to work copying 
the book 
in my mind it was illegal ms adamson was quoted as saying 
gingrich said his staff did copying proofreading and other 
clerical tasks on his book window of opportunity but he said 
house rules permit such activity as long as the book deals with a 
public policy issue which he insisted his book did and the 
staffers work at least 40 hours a week on congressional duties 
house democrats have filed a complaint with the ethics committee 
alleging that gingrich violated house rules and federal campaign 
laws by creating an unusual partnership to promote the book but the 
complaint does not accuse gingrich of any improprieties in the use 
of his staff to work on the book 
the committee has hired the chicago law firm of richard j phelan 
to review the complaint and recommend whether it should launch a 
formal investigation 
phelan was the ethics committees independent counsel in the 
investigation of former speaker jim wright gingrich said phelans 
investigation supports his contention that house rules permit 
members of congress to use staffers to work on books dealing with 
public policy 
one of the allegations against wright was that he used members of 
his congressional staff to help put together his book reflections 
of a public man gingrich said phelan specifically exonerated 
wright on that charge 
gingrich who filed the ethics complaint that led to the 
investigation and eventual resignation of wright disclosed last 
year that his former administrative assistant frank gregorsky 
reviewed and edited the book 
but he said friday that gregorsky actually had left his staff by 
the time he began working on the book 
to the best of my knowledge he said the only work his 
congressional staff did on the book was purely clerical stuff 
i did the entire initial draft he said we didnt delegate 
all that stuff were talking about whether or not somebody helped 
copy things all the rewrite was done at private expense by a 
private coauthor who got paid a royalty and got paid in advance by a 
private publisher

house and senate negotiators are compromising 
on a spending bill that gives president bush less than he requested 
for nuclear weapons production but more than he wants to correct 
environmental damage at the arms plants 
the measure earmarks 165 billion for environmental cleanup in 
the 1990 fiscal year that begins oct 1 compared with 13 billion 
requested by bush 
the provision was part of a 1384 billion appropriations bill 
for energy and water development projects worked out late thursday 
after a full day of deliberation by house and senate negotiators 
the bill settled differences in the appropriations bills passed 
by the house in late june and by the senate in late july final 
approval by both houses is necessary before the measure goes to bush 
for his signature 
the administration had requested 1382 billion for the energy 
and water projects 
house and senate negotiators agreed to smaller sums than 
requested by bush for nuclear weapons activities 458 billion 
instead of 463 billion as well as smaller amounts for the 
nuclear materials production system 216 billion instead of 221 
billion 
congress has sought to push the energy department to speed 
cleanup of the radioactive and toxic wastes that have piled up at 
the nuclear weapons plants over the past four decades in some cases 
contaminating groundwater and soil near the facilities 
among the funds appropriated for waste cleanup was 276 million 
to bring the hanford nuclear reservation near richland wash into 
compliance with environmental standards and 291 million for a 
hanford vitrification facility designed to treat radioactive 
waste by turning it into a glasslike substance 
the measure also provides 55 million for environmental health 
and safety improvements at the feed materials production center 
near fernald ohio which processes uranium for the weapons program 
and has suffered extensive environmental damage 
an additional 267 million was appropriated for unspecified 
environmental and safety improvements at other plants 
among other energy projects to be financed in the coming budget 
year is a modification to the plutonium recovery facility known as 
building 371 at the rocky flats weapons plant near denver the bill 
appropriates 45 million for that work 
another provision of the bill earmarks 225 million for the 
superconducting supercollider a massive physics installation at 
which scientists plan to explore the nature of matter and energy 
the facility expected to cost 59 billion will be built in ellis 
county texas 
the bush administration had requested 250 million for the 
project for 1990

senate majority leader george mitchell says the 
gap between president bushs words and deeds is growing and 
that the president says too little about how hell pay for major 
initiatives 
we saw it on space the president wants to go to mars but 
there is no plan no timetable no price given the maine democrat 
said 
in a wideranging interview with a group of reporters friday 
mitchell said bush advocates bold new programs but seems to want 
congress to worry about how to finance them 
mitchell said for instance that bush provided too little help 
for congress in recommending how money could be moved around in the 
fiscal 1990 budget to cover the 716 million the president wants to 
spend beyond what was initially envisioned for antidrug abuse 
efforts 
bush earlier in the week called such questions carping and 
challenged democrats to back his plan 
i think that what is going to happen is that the appeal of the 
presidents position is going to erode mitchell said the gap 
between his rhetoric and action words and deeds continues to 
grow 
mitchell said he didnt know how long bush could uphold his 1988 
campaign pledge against any general tax increases but said the 
democrats wont make a cavalry charge for such increases without 
his support 
mitchell said lawmakers already are struggling to pass 13 
appropriations bills to carry out the 117 trillion budget 
blueprint agreed upon earlier for the fiscal year starting oct 1 
this is a really tough task he said weve reached an 
agreement almost universally criticized as being inadequate and not 
going far enough and that hasnt even been enacted 
unless lawmakers find a way to cut next years projected deficit 
to 110 billion by oct 15 the grammrudman balancedbudget law 
will automatically trigger spending cuts in many programs 
so we face these constant and it seems accelerating 
pressures to reduce the federal deficit and deal with these 
emerging demands mitchell said 
he said he doubts the house and senate will meet an oct 1 
deadline for passing the money bills as the two chambers did last 
year for the first time in 12 years

americans will continue to borrow for the 
remainder of the year but at a slower pace analysts say after a 
government report that consumer debt fell in july for the first time 
in 2 years 
consumer borrowing has slowed down and will continue to be 
slower than it was for two reasons larry chimerine senior 
economic adviser for the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa said friday 
one reason is that consumer spending is weaker particularly on 
durable goods bigticket items that people generally finance with 
loans chimerine said 
and secondly the high debt levels for many families has 
discouraged people from borrowing more and even when they spend 
they are being forced to pay more cash he said 
the federal reserve reported friday that consumer debt in july 
fell 280 million a seasonally adjusted 05 percent annual rate of 
decline it was the first drop since borrowing fell 34 percent or 
163 billion in january 1987 
although it increased borrowing also was slower in june than 
previously thought the fed said the pace was revised downward 
friday from 51 percent to 47 percent or 272 billion 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group here said the 
decline in borrowing in july although temporary reflects a 
cautious consumer 
she said consumer credit should pick up but added i dont 
think we should expect any major boom in consumer spending 
ms shaber noted that automobile sales which were down in june 
had begun to rise in july and advanced a hefty amount last 
month so august consumer credit should be expected to increase 
but many analysts dont expect the august pace to continue 
because it was driven in large part by endofmodelyear incentives 
and announced 1990model price increases 
auto loans which represent a major portion of consumer debt 
fell in july for the second straight month down 6 percent after a 
23 percent decline in june 
the fed said auto loans dropped 146 billion in july after 
falling 549 million in june auto loans had risen 45 percent in 
may and 33 percent in april 
borrowing for mobile homes declined for the sixth straight month 
down 60 million or 3 percent on an annual basis 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate also 
dropped 26 million or 02 percent on an annual basis that 
compared with advances of 25 percent in june and 72 percent in may 
the only category to show an increase was revolving credit which 
includes credit cards but even that rose at a slower pace than in 
previous months 
the fed said revolving credit rose 8 percent to 127 billion 
it had advanced 201 percent in june and 13 percent in may 
the various changes left total consumer debt in july at a 
seasonally adjusted 70057 billion

the union that represents career diplomats is 
taking legal steps to combat what it calls a disturbing pattern by 
the white house of appointing incompetents to key ambassadorships 
the american foreign service association filed suit friday in 
us district court naming secretary of state james a baker iii as 
the defendant 
the highly unusual move follows the nomination by the white house 
of a number of envoys who have come under sharp criticism on grounds 
they have neither the diplomatic skills nor background knowledge of 
the countries where they are being sent 
some democrats charge that the nominations amount to political 
payoffs for republicans who contributed generously to the party in 
last years presidential campaign or demonstrated skill in raising 
funds for the party 
sen paul sarbanes dmd has described some of the choices as 
insulting 
the suit is the latest salvo in a longsimmering conflict in 
which career diplomats often complain they are bypassed for 
ambassadorial posts in favor political activists with dubious 
qualifications 
among the nominees who have drawn the most complaints is peter 
secchia who helped president bush carry michigan last year and was 
named ambassador to italy many italians were upset when he joked 
that the new italian navy has glassbottom boats so they can see 
the old italian navy 
the new york times complained in a july editorial that bushs 
nominee for spain joseph zappala a florida developer has but one 
claim to the madrid assignment a distinctively large 
contribution to the republican party reportedly 126000 
senate confirmation of zappala and two other nominees have been 
delayed because of doubts about their credentials 
the diplomats union filed the suit to obtain release of 
certificates of competency that the law requires the president 
to submit to the senate on the qualifications of each nominee 
the association said the state department maintains the reports 
are confidential and has refused to provide them to union officials 
since the information in the reports isnt classifiable the 
association said they are being withheld only to avoid 
embarrassment because they so clearly demonstrate the lack of 
qualifications of many of the nominees 
charles a schmitz afsa vice president said that hiding 
certificates from public view is selfdefeating because they 
routinely are made public after they reach the senate which must 
confirm ambassadorial appointees for them to become effective 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler herself a 
political appointee cited the example of a 1970 nomination to 
demonstrate the wisdom of some selections outside the foreign 
service 
she said that president nixon chose a defeated candidate for the 
senate to be his ambassador at the united nations over the strong 
objection of a major news publication the appointees name 
george herbert walker bush

here is a chronology of president reagans 
health difficulties 
1967 while he was governor of california reagan had 
approximately 30 seedlike stones removed from his urinary tract he 
had a transurethral prostatic resection the same kind of operation 
performed during his second presidential term in 1986 
1979 he complained of pain in the right thumb which was 
determined to be osteoarthritic 
march 30 1981 a bullet fired at reagan in an attempt on his 
life hit him in the upper chest below the left arm traveled 
downward and was deflected into the left lung coming to rest an 
inch from his heart he was rushed to george washington university 
hospital complaining of soreness in the rib cage he collapsed in 
the hospital corridor the bullet was removed during three hours of 
surgery and reagan returned to the white house after 12 days in the 
hospital 
april 1 1982 reagan underwent a routine urological examination 
at bethesda naval hospital after complaining of discomfort doctors 
found no evidence of malignancy 
sept 7 1983 reagan having grown noticeably hard of hearing 
was seen wearing a small hearing aid in his right ear when he 
appeared before a group of business and education leaders he has 
attributed his hearing loss to the firing of a handgun too near his 
ear on a movie set many years ago reagan later began wearing a 
hearing aid in the left ear as well 
may 18 1984 a small polyp was discovered in the presidents 
colon but an examination showed the polyp was noncancerous and it 
was not removed 
march 11 1985 the white house disclosed that doctors examining 
reagan earlier that month found evidence of blood in his stool and a 
growth in his lower intestine a statement said tests of occult or 
hidden blood in the feces were positive but that physicians 
believe this may be from the polyp or from diet and will be 
monitored 
march 29 1985 reagan suffered a burst blood vessel in his left 
eye causing it to fill partially with blood and appear red white 
house spokesman larry speakes said no treatment was needed 
july 12 1985 doctors removed a small benign polyp from 
reagans colon and found another larger one that was removed the 
next day along with 2 feet of the presidents intestinal tract the 
larger 2inch polyp was found to be cancerous but doctors said 
the cancer had not spread beyond the tissues that were removed 
aug 1 1985 the white house responding to questions said an 
irritated patch of skin had been removed from reagans nose two days 
earlier a statement said the tissue was submitted for routine 
studies for infection and it was determined no further treatment is 
necessary four days later he told a news conference that the 
pimple had been skin cancer 
jan 17 1986 reagan had three small polyps removed from his 
intestine during a sixhour visit to bethesda in his first major 
postcancer colonoscopy checkup they were described as very 
small measuring 1 millimeter to 2 millimeters in size 
a shaving of facial tissue from a growth on the right side of 
reagans face was also taken lab tests showed that the three polyps 
and facial tissue were benign 
june 21 1986 in a fivehour visit to bethesda reagan had two 
small polyps removed from his colon the growths ranging in size 
from 1 millimeter to 15 millimeters were benign 
reagan also had an eye examination and a dermatological 
examination of his nose from which he has had two small skin 
cancers removed 
jan 4 1987 reagan had four benign polyps removed from his 
colon by doctors at bethesda and the presidents physician army 
col john hutton said tests show no evidence of a recurrence of 
the cancer found in july 1985 
jan 5 1987 reagan underwent successful prostate surgery the 
surgery which removed nearly an ounce of tissue was to relieve 
what a spokesman called mild recurring discomfort apparently 
due to an enlarged prostate a gland surrounding the urethra at the 
base of the bladder 
june 26 1987 reagan had two small polyps removed from his 
colon during an examination in the physicians office in the white 
house they were found to be benign hutton said a routine prostate

without a thought of contacting police or bank officials 
instead nalder 70 of scottsdale counted the money and set out 
to find shelly clay the phoenix woman whose name and address was in 
the envelope 
i guess if it had been a huge wad of green stuff id have 
thought it was dope money and taken it to the police but i just 
thought it would be nice to see the persons face who lost it 
said nalder 
in addition to the cash was a receipt for a 71000 certificate 
of deposit he said 
mrs clay said she and her husband curtis had concluded the 
money was lost and would never be returned when nalder arrived at 
her home 
she said shed withdrawn the money from her cd account for a car 
purchase and apparently dropped it as she was leaving the bank

it was poor really needed it and wasnt some rich person that way 
i could feel like at least i hadnt lost it all for nothing she 
said 
she said she insisted on giving nalder 200 for his honesty

the priestess of the church of the most high 
goddess who wears a red sequin strapless dress and fishnet 
stockings insists sex with hundreds of men is her religious duty 
but a jury says its prostitution 
known as sabrina aset to her flock mary ellen tracy says she 
takes part in an ancient misunderstood egyptian religion in which 
sexual rituals put men on the path back to the divine 
but a superior court jury wasnt convinced deciding after 3 
days of deliberations friday that mrs tracy 46 was no more than a 
prostitute working out of a beverly hills home that was a thinly 
disguised brothel 
i am not a prostitute mrs tracy said after the verdict 
im very hurt by that im a very sincere and honest person to be 
portrayed as some kind of moneygrubbing schemer is really 
devastating 
jurors convicted her of operating a house of ill fame and two 
counts of prostitution her husband wilbur tracy 51 was also 
convicted of operating a house of ill fame 
they face a possible sixmonth jail sentence and 1000 fine on 
each count when sentenced thursday by municipal court judge marion 
obera the church had drawn more than 2000 male followers and 
was born of divine inspiration mrs tracy said 
the couple have vowed to appeal the misdemeanor convictions 
contending their activities are protected by the first amendment 
we were found guilty of heresy wilbur tracy said 
the tracys contend that they worship the oldest religion in the 
world dating back to 3200 bc they said aspects of the religion 
are found on egyptian scrolls 
once a mormon mrs tracy said she was ordained as the high 
priestess by her husband in 1984 wilbur tracy said he had been 
ordained as a high priest that year by a priestess he did not 
identify 
at various times as many as 10 other women acted as priestesses 
all ordained by wilbur tracy the church is a spanishstyle 
rented house near beverly hills 
the sparsely furnished home had no pews or pulpit the few wall 
hangings included posters of movie stars and a framed nude 
photograph of mrs tracy 
the tracys advertise in a risque newspaper called the hollywood 
press in exchange for a column mrs tracy writes for the paper 
men who want to attend the church phone ahead for an interview 
with mrs tracy who decides whether to accept them she claims to 
have turned down many men who were insincere about the spiritual 
aspect of the rituals and asked for massages and all kinds of 
weird things 
when the men arrive at the church they take part in a series of 
rituals that include sexual acts with the priestess that mrs tracy 
says spiritually cleanses the men 
what hes doing is symbolically giving up his very all in 
order to have his sins wiped out mrs tracy said 
the men then leave a sacrifice usually money in a practice 
that mrs tracy acknowledged gave the police a few problems 
mrs tracy said that before she became a high priestess she had 
never had sex outside of marriage but that she has continued to 
practice her religion with the help of prayer 
ive always been very willing to do what god required whether 
to be monogamous or to have sex with a few thousand men she said 
it really doesnt matter i try to be accepting or openminded

the mayor and officials at a private 
school for minority children claim that a group of neighbors helped 
shut down the school for racially motivated reasons 
neighbors who signed a petition challenging the schools zoning 
included chef julia child and constitutional scholar laurence tribe 
a harvard law school professor 
they want peace and quiet at the expense of children and ethnic 
people said mayor alfred vellucci who also heads the school 
committee which had backed the private school they dont want 
anyone around while they smell the flowers 
classes at the commonwealth day school were called off because 
the petition led to a review of its zoning approval school 
officials could not guarantee the school would be open after next 
week when the state land court reviews its zoning status 
residents say they pressed for the repeal of zoning approval 
because commonwealth violates city zoning laws and causes traffic 
congestion on a long narrow street 
their attorney howard medwed denied racism was an issue 
some people are claiming racism is involved when there are far 
far different motives medwed said 
he said the residents some of whom own houses valued at more 
than 1 million were concerned for the peace and quiet of the 
historic neighborhood 
commonwealth which was founded in 1971 moved last september to 
the building at brattle street that formerly housed the mostly white 
new preparatory school bert giroux of the city schools department 
said the high school was at the site for 50 years without major 
complaints from residents 
the petition said commonwealth would come under different zoning 
standards than the high school since it was for younger children 
commonwealths headmaster robert myette said the zoning board 
voted unanimously in october to grant permits to run the preschool 
and elementary school 
jean brooks who lives next door to the school solicited 
signatures from more than 150 neighbors in the area and filed for an 
appeal of the schools permits 
brooks said she doesnt believe the petition closed the school 
they closed because they could not build up a large 
constituency she said 
several people affiliated with the school said the petition 
played a major role in the closing 
through court orders they choked the school economically 
said jack gottlieb whose 5yearold daughter was one of seven white 
students among the 50 students at the school i think they didnt 
like to see black little kids running around 
but some people said they were confused by the petition 
tribe said that when he was presented the petition he was told 
the residents were trying to improve safety for the school children 
he said he was angered by the way the case turned out and that he 
would investigate further 
david ives president of wgbh said he signed the brooks petition 
because of simple neighborly interest in zoning laws and that he 
knew nothing about the fate of the school in the matter 
julia child was traveling to massachusetts from california on 
friday and could not be reached for comment

colombian president virgilio barco is asking 
president bush for help in supporting higher coffee prices the 
white house says 
colombian coffee growers have been hard hit by recent price 
declines and some analysts worry that at least some might be 
tempted to switch to coca leaves the raw material for cocaine 
coca can produce far higher profits per acre than any other crop 
us support for higher coffee prices would represent a switch 
from the us position in international negotiations for a renewal 
of key provisions of an international agreement on coffee marketing 
president barco did communicate on this issue spokesman 
roman popadiuk said friday night we are studying the issue 
carefully 
he declined to give details about barcos request 
colombian cocaine gangs the source of 80 percent of the drug 
consumed in the united states and the government are engaged in a 
bitter battle over the cocaine trade hundreds of judges 
journalists and other officials have been murdered by the drug 
traffickers 
as a result of a breakdown of negotiations in july the 74nation 
international coffee organization suspended export quotas for member 
nations for the third time in its 26year history 
the united states and some producing nations opposed quotas 
during the negotiations 
the july 1 price of about 120 per pound for unroasted beans 
the floor target price of the organization fell to 80 cents by the 
end of the month it now stands at about 85 cents

edward i koch in the fourcandidate democratic primary 
the announcement was made by state assemblyman jose serrano of

university in white plains said in a statement issued by the center 
in that election thousands of minority voters were 
disenfranchised when they were improperly purged from the election

were discouraged deterred and in some instances coerced from 
exercising their right to vote 
out of a fear that this conduct would once again occur we 
sought federal intervention scottmclaughlin said 
he said the center was told friday by david marblestone an 
attorney in the justice departments voting rights section that 
observers would be coming to new york

department spokeswoman deborah burstionwade who said it is the 
governments policy not to comment on voting observers until the day

percent the other two democratic candidates comptroller harrison 
j goldin and richard ravitch got 4 percent and 2 percent 
respectively four percent were undecided

margin of error 6 percentage points was greater than the gap 
between the two 
nine out of 10 blacks surveyed said they would vote for dinkins 
who is black a 20 percentagepoint gain over a july poll

the bush administration will ask for up to 3 
million for the political campaign of an opponent of nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega according to a report published today 
the administration had been considering using the cia to affect 
the election in nicaragua but now is leaning toward using the 
donation to the campaign of violeta chamorro because it wouldnt 
draw as much fire from congress the washington post reported 
the february election is seen by the bush administration as an 
opportunity to end the rule of ortegas marxistled sandinista 
government 
the money would be drawn from the national endowment for 
democracy an organization created by congress in 1982 to support 
democratic processes worldwide the post reported 
under nicaraguan law half the money donated to a political 
candidate from outside the country must be handed over to the 
supreme election council the supreme election council is supposed 
to use that money to help defray costs of the election 
but that law means if the united states will have to donate a 
total of 6 million to ensure that 3 million goes into the 
chamorros campaign treasury the post reported citing unnamed 
sources

wilkesbarre pa ap a couple convicted of thirddegree 
murder for starving their 14yearold son plan to appeal on the 
ground their childrens religious beliefs may take precedence over 
parental responsibility 
one of the major issues in this case which we were not allowed 
to argue in front of the jury was the childrens constitutional 
rights to exercise their religious beliefs and whether that right 
exceeds the parental duty said al flora jr one of the couples 
lawyers 
eric cottam died jan 3 after the family went without food for 
six weeks despite nearly 4000 saved as a tithe for god larry and 
leona cottams 12yearold daughter laura recovered from 
malnourishment and is in foster care 
in addition to thirddegree murder which required a jury finding 
of malice on the part of cottam 39 and mrs cottam 38 the couple 
were found guilty friday of reckless endangerment and endangering 
the welfare of children 
the cottams held hands and showed no emotion as the verdicts were 
read jurors had deliberated 1 hours 
the cottams didnt eat for six weeks beginning nov 22 despite 
3775 saved as a tithe or offering for god larry cottam a 
former seventhday adventist pastor said he believed using the 
money would have been akin to stealing 
laura cottam testified she had several dollars saved as a tithe 
but also believed spending the money for food would have been the 
same as stealing 
luzerne county judge gifford s cappelini decided not to allow 
use of the childrens first amendment rights to religious freedom as 
a defense because they still lived in their parents care 
i think their parental duty is paramount cappellini told the 
associated press 
flora said he planned to appeal 
the issue of whether the children could exercise their own 
religious beliefs gets into some significant first amendment 
issues that have not been decided in this country said joseph 
cosgrove cocounsel for the cottams 
eleanor culpepper a juror said seeing pictures of the teenage 
boys body weighed heavily on the jury eric was 5 feet 9 inches 
tall and weighed 69 pounds when he died jan 3 
its kind of hard to believe the philadelphia nurse said 
assistant district attorney thomas marsilio said previous 
convictions in starvation cases in pennsylvania had never risen 
above involuntary manslaughter 
the cottams remained free on 50000 bail each an anonymous 
benefactor posted bail for them aug 23 after they spent 230 days in 
custody following their jan 5 arraignment 
no sentencing date has been set pending posttrial motions the 
cottams face a maximum 28 years in prison 
eric cottam died in an upstairs bedroom of the familys modest 
twostory home in nuangola just south of this northeastern 
pennsylvania city 
a day later larry cottam notified police larry leona and laura 
cottam required hospitalization for malnutrition 
flora said during the twoweek trial that the reclusive family 
went without food because they distrusted authorities and believed 
god would rescue them they also believed their children would be 
taken away from them if they sought help he said 
it was a situation where you had a family that in a sense 
lost touch with reality flora said 
during the trial flora said the family became alienated from 
society in 1984 after their children alleged they had been sexually 
abused by adults including their paternal grandparents who denied 
the claims as well as a seventhday advenist leader and church 
officials at the seventhday adventist school near their home

i will never forget the smell of a burning body one sailor said

at gaeta said they had not seen a copy of the report and refused to 
fully identify themselves the associated press requested access to 
the iowa but it was denied by the navy 
the report released by the pentagon on thursday said 
circumstantial evidence indicated gunners mate clayton m 
hartwig intentionally sparked the april 19 explosion in a turret for 
16inch guns 
a sailor who identified himself only as being from miami said he 
worked in the turret six months before the explosion and had asked 
to be transferred to another assignment 
i am glad i transferred because i had been there i had loaded 
the same guns i would have been in the middle of it if i had my 
way i would be off the iowa by now he said 
a lot of the guys who died were my friends 
one crewman expressed doubt that hartwig was to blame 
i find it hard to believe that one guy could be responsible for

two of jim bakkers former aides were 
given long prison terms and heavy fines penalties their attorney 
blamed on the television evangelist 
us district judge robert potter on friday sentenced david 
taggart to 18 years five months in prison and his brother james to 
17 years nine months he also ordered each to pay 500000 fines 
and for the two of them to pay 525000 in back taxes 
they came and they learned everything they did from jim 
bakker said ben cotten the taggarts attorney who said he hadnt 
decided whether to appeal the sentences 
he called the sentences unduly harsh 
david taggarts prison sentence was the maximum he could have 
received 
cotten also predicted that if bakker is convicted in his fraud 
and conspiracy trial the ptl founder will receive a stiff sentence 
he has to look forward to an even more severe sentence not 
only because of the number of counts hes charged with but because 
of judge potters assessment of responsibility for what went on out 
there at ptl cotten said 
cotten said there was a possibility of a reduction in sentence in 
exchange for the taggarts testimony against bakker david taggart 
has testified james taggart has not been called in the case 
potter announced the sentences after court recessed friday in 
bakkers trial bakker and another aide are accused of using nearly 
4 million in ministry contributions to fund his lavish lifestyle 
the taggarts were convicted of evading taxes on 11 million they 
received from the ministry money they used to pay for personal 
luxuries such as expensive trips a trump tower apartment in new 
york and jaguar cars according to testimony 
judge potter sent a message that whitecollar crimes arent 
going to go unpunished said prosecutor david brown they lied 
to the jury under oath and showed no remorse 
bakker was not in the courtroom for the sentencing 
potter blasted the taggarts saying 
i cannot understand the minds of these defendants they seem to 
feel like they had an unlimited check out there they kept going to 
it over the years 
whitecollar criminals seem to get away with extremely light 
sentences its time we do something about that 
neither taggart said anything during the short hearing and 
neither displayed emotion david taggart served as bakkers personal 
aide james taggart worked as ptls interior decorator the brothers 
joined the ministry as piano players 
in testimony at bakkers trial friday a minister said he felt 
robbed and cheated after he bought a lifetime partnership 
from ptl for lodging in a hotel that was never built 
the rev alan foor pastor of the united church of christ in 
beavertown pa testified he was a monthly contributor to ptl but 
became angry when he learned how well bakker lived 
for 1000 people were guaranteed a certain number of nights per 
year in a hotel at the ministrys heritage usa retreat near fort 
mill sc 
foor said he never used the lodging because the hotel he was a 
partner in wasnt completed

motion for a stay of his trial the 4th us circuit court of

art and the dallas skyline are visible through 6 million worth of 
glass panes that make a sweeping curve of the lobby 
the hall includes a 4463pipe organ italian marble and 
artificially weathered limestone 
us house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said the hall 
sends a message to the world that dallas is determined to be a 
leader in the arts 
i think the real meaning of all of this is that dallas and its 
people have the capacity to build and succeed at a time that has not 
been economically good to do so he said 
conductor eduardo mata said the halls opening was a historic 
moment for the dallas symphony orchestra and the city 
this shows what people can do if they work together and work 
hard mata said after fridays concert im sure this hall will 
set the standard for years to come 
even though it has been trumpeted as a worldclass music hall 
the center is not without critics 
they contend dallas city leaders have misplaced priorities 
and should have poured much of the money spent on the hall into road 
repair education and expanded police and fire protection

president bush declaring its time to come 
together says hes willing to accept changes by congress in his 
antidrug program to win broad bipartisan support 
i understand nobodys going to do it exactly my way bush 
said friday striking a conciliatory note after earlier lashing out 
at critics 
i would be very closeminded if i said you cant have this 
change or another or we cant make this part of it better or 
another but this is no time for partisan carping 
critics complain that bushs 79 billion strategy is 
underfunded and doesnt go far enough the program emphasizes 
tougher penalties for drug users and more money for jails and law 
enforcement as well as increased funds to attack drugs in countries 
where they are produced 
bush made his comments in speeches in new orleans before the us 
hispanic chamber of commerce and the predominantly black national 
baptist convention usa inc 
bush said there can be differences on some issues but not on 
this one not as our country tries to fight come up with a national 
strategy and then fight the narcotics that are ripping off and 
killing the kids of this country their very soul 
its time to come together he said 
on his return to washington friday evening bush flew by 
helicopter to the presidential retreat at camp david for the weekend 
en route to washington bush tried to call former president 
reagan at the mayo clinic in rochester minn however reagan 
already was undergoing surgery to relieve an accumulation of fluid 
on his brain a condition doctors say probably resulted when reagan 
was thrown from a horse over the summer 
were all worried about it bush said as he awaited word on 
the outcome of the surgery i hope its all right pray its all 
right lovely guy a lovely person 
a reagan spokesman said after the hourlong surgery that the 
operation had been successful and that the 78yearold former 
president was resting comfortably 
addressing the baptists bush said the drug crisis and other 
problems were related to another serious problem the decline of 
the most basic institution of all the decline of the american 
family 
we must work together to save the american family he said in 
a crusadelike call to give children the love and support that will 
prompt them to choose education over the easy money of crime 
how can you teach respect for a hardearned dollar when that 
easy drug money flourishes out there on the streets he asked as 
the audience applauded and how can you persuade young men and 
women to have faith in themselves when their mother and dad have 
lost all faith 
bush flew to new orleans a day after a washington postabc news 
poll showed 75 percent of those surveyed approved of his handling of 
the drug crisis and 82 percent approved of the proposals he 
announced tuesday 
chief of staff john sununu told reporters that september is the 
critical month for the drug campaign as the administration labors to 
gain support while congress is working on the federal budget

a former north korean deputy army chief 
of staff and ambassador to the soviet union said today that north 
korean leader kim il sung started the korean war by ordering an 
invasion of south korea 
the korean war was personally ordered by kim il sung and i can 
testify on details said lee sang jo 74 who defected to the 
soviet union in 1961 
considering the fact that seoul fell to the north korean army 
only three days after the war began it is beyond question who 
started the korean war the former north korean army general said 
lee now a naturalized soviet citizen said he came to south 
korea on tuesday to visit relatives in his hometown of pusan on the 
southern coast 
after a courtesy call on park chulun a cabinet minister without 
porfolio lee said he planned to hold a news conference next week to 
discuss the korean war and his relations with kim il sung 
lee as a lieutenant general was north koreas deputy army chief 
of staff when the war broke out on june 25 1950 
the north korean army backed by soviet tanks invaded and 
overran most of south korea in less than three months but was 
repelled by allied un forces led by us gen douglas macarthur 
after chinese volunteer forces intervened on the side of north 
korea the war became stalemated forcing both sides to start talks 
to halt the conflict 
in the armistice talks with un forces lee served as the deputy 
north korean delegate he later replaced gen nam il as the chief 
communist negotiator in the talks the fighting ended july 27 1953 
but the two countries are still technically at war 
lee defected to the soviet union after serving as north koreas 
ambassador to moscow from 1957 to 1960 he said his defection was to 
avoid kim il sungs mass purge of political enemies 
lees trip to seoul reflects warming relations between south 
korea and the soviet union the countries have no diplomatic 
relations but have expanded nonpolitical contacts significantly in 
recent years they exchanged trade offices early this year

angry shrimpers who blockaded a waterway 
cooled off after hearing that president bush agreed to review 
regulations requiring them to use turtle excluder devices in their 
nets 
we gave them 10 days 10 days we told those guys we have to 
hear something before then we want to hear that instead of hurting 
the people and spending tax money that theyre going to start a 
hatchery for those turtle eggs and raise them thats what they need 
to do not hurt us said shrimper emery eymard 
the coast guard said 37 vessels took part in the daylong 
blockade on friday in south louisiana but protesting shrimpers 
estimated between 50 and 100 big doublerigged boats barricaded the 
industrial pass 
the blockade ended at 5 pm after the coast guard relayed word 
from us rep billy tauzin dla that bush had agreed to review 
the regulations bush met with tauzin us reps lindy boggs 
dla and bob livingston rla during his visit to new orleans 
friday 
we received the presidents commitment to look into the 
commerce department decision on monday tauzin said he said that 
john sununu bushs chief of staff will meet with commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher 
no arrests were made friday and no violence was reported said 
coast guard cmdr william loeftstedt authorities however did take 
down names and boat registrations of the protesting shrimpers 
about 500 demonstrating shrimpers from louisiana mississippi 
alabama and florida carried picket signs along bushs motorcade 
route in new orleans 
the blockade on the water formed at belle pass near grand isle 
friday morning a few hours after the regulations requiring the use 
of the teds took effect the coast guard said some of the vessels 
flew the skull and crossbones others flew american flags upside 
down a distress signal 
more than 30 boats were unable to get through the pass which is 
used mostly by shrimpers and oil company boats coast guard cmdr 
dave smith said 
another 30 to 40 shrimpers blocked the intracoastal waterway near 
intracoastal city la said chief petty officer glenn lamont no 
arrests were made at the remote location near the center of 
louisianas coastline he said 
an estimated 11000 sea turtles die each year in gulf coast 
shrimp nets including the endangered kemps ridley leatherneck and 
hawksbill and the threatened loggerhead and green sea turtles 
the cagelike teds fit in the back section of a shrimp trawl a 
grid across the middle allows shrimp to flow through but catches 
turtles waterflow through the device helps turtles escape via a 
trap door 
shrimpers say they lose 10 percent to 30 percent of their shrimp 
through the teds commerce officials say sidebyside tests have 
shown losses of 2 percent to 5 percent 
mosbacher had tried allowing shrimpers to limit their trawling 
times to 105 minutes with the idea that most turtles wouldnt drown 
in that time but the method was found to be ineffective 
failure to use teds could result in a maximum 20000 fine but 
the commerce department will phase in its enforcement

haggling over percentage points representing 
thousands of dollars in commissions for laundering drug money was 
common in the world of the the medellin cocaine cartels financial 
director court documents indicate 
an affidavit filed in us district court in atlanta by drug 
enforcement administration agent albert d latson chronicles part of 
the governments 2year undercover investigation of the cartel it 
portrays eduardo martinez romero as having a role in laundering tens 
of millions of dollars through us and panamanian banks 
martinez 36 remained in custody friday under tight security on 
federal moneylaundering and fraud charges after his extradition 
from colombia he was flown to atlanta early thursday and faces a 
monday court hearing 
martinez who told a federal judge in a preliminary hearing 
thursday that he has a graduate degree in marketing bargained with 
undercover dea agents during a secretly videotaped meeting in march 
1988 on the caribbean island of aruba according to the latsons 
affidavit 
the undercover operation based in atlanta used dea agents to 
act as americans interested in laundering cocaine profits from 
colombia 
a typical transaction worked this way according to the court 
documents money would be delivered to a financial broker in the 
united states who then took it to one of several companies some 
legitimate and some false 
the company would deposit the cash under its name and then send 
the now clean money by wire transfer to a second bank account 
controlled by banco de occidente in panama 
typically those banks were in new york and los angeles but 
martinez told the agents that banco de occidente wanted to open an 
account in an atlanta bank in hopes of the money being delivered 
faster 
banco de occidente would have the funds transferred to panama to 
accounts controlled by martinez according to the affidavit 
delays in getting the money moving cost the cartel in lost 
interest and made it more likely that us authorities would have an 
opportunity to seize the funds 
as the agents attempted to get martinez business he compared 
them to a uruguayan group known as la mina a precious metals 
exporter but also known to federal prosecutors as another drug money 
launderer latson said in the document 
la mina martinez told the agents charged 7 percent per 
transaction but the undercover agents organization would cost him 
8 percent and he wanted a discount martinez also was taped saying 
la mina could launder huge amounts of money in only 48 hours 
gobetweens and couriers working for the launderers could make 
thousands of dollars per transaction 44710 for a 1035 million 
deal in december 1987 109514 for 15 million in january 1988 
for example 
at an earlier meeting in panama martinez told the agents that if 
something goes wrong with the process an unidentified they 
would kidnap and interrogate those involved and retaliate if the 
answers were not satisfactory latson said in his affidavit 
eventually the affidavit said the agents reached an agreement 
with martinez to launder some of the medellin cartels money 
including a series of transactions in february and march of this 
year involving some 62 million 
the la mina group was indicted earlier this year in los angeles 
on moneylaundering charges stemming from the same investigation 
that snared martinez operation polar cap

willie b has shown there is hope for even the 
most sheltered bachelors of the world 
zoo atlantas famous lowland gorilla who spent almost three 
decades alone in a cage mated friday with a 6yearold female in 
front of his stunned trainer and visiting children who hadnt 
expected to see such monkey business 
what better way to have an introduction to life said amy 
gross a zoo visitor 
zoo officials thought it would be at least another year before 
the 31yearold gorilla well did what comes naturally

dr terry maple the zoos director hes not as bad off as we 
thought

the nations lawmakers are sidestepping crucial 
decisions on when life begins and when it should end despite medical 
advances on both issues a judge told a conference of doctors 
judges and ethicists 
the other branches of government by and large refuse to accept 
their responsibility washington dc superior court judge 
gladys kessler said friday these issues do not have a consensus 
in society 
she said apparently lawmakers believe that the waters are too 
turbulent to take strong stands on the lifeanddeath issues 
kessler told the national judicial college bioethics conference 
that most laws nationwide say the state has an absolute right to 
preserve life but few laws have been passed that take into 
account fine legal distinctions that have developed as people live 
longer and survive illnesses that would have killed them just a 
decade ago 
how can we avoid the harder and most emotionladen issue of the 
quality of life she asked some 150 conferees from across the 
country 
chief justices nationwide were invited to send two judges to the 
conference at the nations premiere school for judges on the 
university of nevada reno campus 
twenty national organizations including the american medical 
association and the national bar association also were asked to 
send two delegates each to the meeting 
we wanted to hold the conference because these issues must be 
discussed to come up with some answers that judges can take back to 
their states said thomas russell associate dean of the college 
the courtroom usually is the place of last resort for these 
medicalethical issues to be resolved 
ms kessler was joined friday by ruth purtilo 
ethicistinresidence at massachusetts general hospital in 
explaining to conferees the latest bioethical dilemmas 
everybodys thinking about ethics these days its almost a 
national pastime ms purtilo said we have a complete society 
thats worrying 
we all are in a new neighborhood of thought of deliberations 
people are living longer and surviving longer because of medical 
technology its the stuff of science fiction but its here 
ms purtilo told doctors and judges they must not only consider 
medical facts surrounding the case but also review whats best for 
patients families and in some cases the unborn 
in doing that ms purtilo warned that often there would be more 
than one wrong and one right answer to a dilemma and judges and 
doctors would be forced to make such lifeanddeath decisions 
under terrible pressures of time 
we as a society have to understand that the patients voice 
must be heard she said

an american missionary was deported after 
kenyas chief immigration official told him he should have left last 
year when his organization was banned the missionarys daughter 
said today 
richard hamilton of medford ore boarded a kenya airways flight 
to london friday night after spending about 24 hours in the custody 
of kenyan officials said his daughter carolee laroi 
we were told by the us embassy that he was sent out last 
night mrs laroi said we never heard from him 
an embassy official was prevented from seeing hamilton at kenyas 
immigration department but caught up with him at the airport she 
said 
they contacted us to tell him he was ok she said 
hamilton 51 was director of the east african christian mission 
in kenya 
kenyas chief immigration official frank kwinga on friday said 
hamilton and his wife jane should have left kenya in july 1988 
when their mission which has been in kenya 15 years was banned 
mrs laroi said her mother was prepared to leave the country but 
had not been officially contacted as of today 
shes going to wait until they tell her to go she said by 
telephone from the hamiltons home in kitale about 215 miles 
northwest of nairobi the capital 
on friday mrs hamilton said she believed her husband was being 
used as a scapegoat in a local scandal 
hamilton was deported one day after being extensively questioned 
about a meeting he had a week earlier with a controversial bishop of 
the anglican church of the province of kenya 
mrs hamilton said the kenyans apparently believed her husband 
passed information to the bishop alexander muge muge on tuesday 
claimed that a senior kenyan civil servant skimmed 462000 pounds of 
maize from relief food destined for faminestricken parts of 
southern sudan 
mrs hamilton and the bishop contacted by telephone denied 
hamilton had passed any such information to muge during their 
meeting 
mrs hamilton and muge said the meeting concerned hamiltons 
interest in whether muges church would act as an umbrella 
organization under which hamiltons mission could be reregistered 
with the government 
the mission was ordered to close after a local official 
complained to nairobi authorities that he believed the hamiltons 
were allied with his political enemies mrs hamilton said 
she said that although their work permits were consequently 
invalidated the couple appealed and received verbal assurances from 
the attorney general and local officials that they could continue 
their development work in the arid west pokot region until the 
appeal was decided 
in november 1987 the hamiltons were threatened with deportation 
after the kenyans accused them of involvement in an alleged ku klux 
klanbacked plot to overthrow the government of president daniel 
arap moi the alleged plot was later found to be a baseless threat 
from a disgruntled kenyanborn priest living in the united states 
a year earlier the kenyans detained two americans working at the 
hamiltons mission and accused them of illegally trying to import 
guns and radio transmitters one of the detained missionaries lyle 
hutson 63 also of medford had a heart attack and died while in 
police custody 
the mission said the suspect shipment included air rifles and air 
pistols but no real weapons

nearly 30000 people marched 
through downtown buenos aires to protest possible presidential 
pardons for military officers accused of torture and killings in the 
1970s 
the march friday was the first large demonstration during the 
2monthold administration of president carlos menem who is 
considering pardons for officers accused of human rights violations 
in the militarys dirty war against leftists 
the marchers trailed behind a huge banner reading no impunity 
trial and punishment for the guilty police said about 30000 
people participated 
menem called the march political and told reporters he 
planned to resolve the military problem by the end of the year 
he provided no details 
speaking to reporters at government house menem said argentines 
should begin working in the present for the future and set 
aside the past without forgetting it 
the demonstration was organized by human rights groups and some 
leftist political parties including a faction of menems 
laborbased peronist party 
the pardon menem is promising the murderers is a way of showing 
that justice does not exist in this country said hebe bonafini 
president of the mothers of the plaza de mayo a group of mothers 
and relatives of people who disappeared during the antisubversion 
campaign and are presumed dead 
menem has said action is needed to end militarycivilian tensions 
growing out of the brutal campaign against suspected leftwing 
subversives by military governments that ruled from 1976 until 1983 
a government commission named by menems predecessor former 
president raul alfonsin determined that at least 8900 people 
disappeared during that time 
it is going to be very difficult for us to fulfill the 
fundamental objective of growth and development with social justice 
if we maintain permanently open wounds in the heart of our 
community menem said friday 
two separate military groups are involved in reports of possible 
pardons 
one includes about 30 middleranking army officers headed by 
col mohamed seineldin and lt col aldo rico who face disciplinary 
action for taking part in army uprisings in april 1987 and january 
and december 
the revolts quelled with little bloodshed were aimed at ending 
the civiliancourt trials of officers accused of human rights abuses 
in earlier cases 
in the second group are 17 army generals and two navy admirals 
who face trial on charges that include murder torture and 
kidnapping 
the buenos aires newspaper la nacion quoted menem on friday as 
saying he would order a pardon for the rebels when he returns from a 
trip later this month to the united states 
officials have indicated that before the end of the year menem 
also would pardon the generals and admirals awaiting trial but not 
not for six former members of the military junta and highranking 
officers already convicted and sentenced

after brushing by bermuda and skirting the us coast 
forecasters at the national hurricane center said late friday 
they expect gabrielle to shift to the northeast over the weekend and 
move away from the canadian coast 
the slowing down means gabrielle is probably going to change 
direction said meteorologist jim gross were not forecasting 
landfall 
but gross said there is still a 10 to 15 percent chance gabrielle 
could move toward nova scotia or newfoundland by late monday 
meanwhile gabrielle was expected to gradually lose forward speed 
and strength he said 
the swells are going to affect the eastern us coast and the 
maritime provinces of canada for some time gross said at least 
the next two days 
swells up to 20 feet lashed at the eastern tip of bermuda friday 
where one house was damaged the day before marine traffic around 
the island was halted as the storm produced 10foot swells even in 
harbors 
at 6 am edt today the center of gabrielle was located near 
384 north latitude and 600 west longitude or about 400 miles 
south of sable island nova scotia 
gabrielle had 90 mph winds and was moving north at 10 mph the 
hurricane which earlier peaked at 135 mph was expected to keep 
hurricanestrength winds of at least 74 mph through the weekend 
gross said 
meanwhile felix which has rumbled around the atlantic as both a 
storm and a weak hurricane was headed on a northeastern course 
away from land late friday 
the storm lost its tropical characteristics and would not merge 
with gabrielle as both systems earlier courses indicated gross 
said 
there have been five hurricanes in this atlantic hurricane 
season which began june 1 and runs to nov 30

and a new life in the west a red cross official said today 
the number of east germans making the risky overnight dash across 
the border was down from the 100 or so who arrived early friday

than 6000 east germans now waiting in hungary to go to west germany 
will be allowed to leave en masse in the next few days 
officials in budapest said friday they expect the thousands of 
east german refugees to leave for the west within days from tent 
camps summer cabins and other makeshift lodgings where many have 
spent weeks 
hungary has been caught between the two germanys anxious to 
prove to bonn that it is committed to human rights but worried about 
angering the orthodox leadership in east berlin negotiations were 
under way to resolve the issue 
another 6000 east germans have fled to austria from hungary this 
summer since budapest began removing barbed wire and other barriers 
from its border with austria in may all but one have gone on to 
west germany where they receive automatic citizenship and help in 
starting a new life 
few east germans are allowed to visit the west but trips to 
neighboring hungary have been easy to arrange 
the hungarian border increasingly is serving as a way west for 
other soviet bloc citizens who seek asylum in austria red cross 
officials say 
most nights this week romanian citizens have been among those 
arriving in austria which has a policy of caring for them while 
they apply to become political refugees or seek emigration to 
another western nation 
todays new arrivals included five romanians and one bulgarian

most of the 55 people who died when a 
charter plane crashed in the north sea were lottery winners taking a 
free trip to west germany the company that sponsored the contest 
said 
forty ships and a helicopter today searched the waters off 
denmarks west coast for bodies from fridays crash denmarks 
public radio said 
the twinengine cv580 convair turboprop plane was traveling from 
oslo norway to hamburg west germany when it went down 18 miles 
north of the danish fishing port of hirtshals the cause of the 
crash was not known 
rescue officials previously had identified the aircraft as a 
convair 440 but company officials said it was a cv580 
all 50 passengers employees of the wilhelmsen lines shipping 
company of oslo and the crew of five were presumed dead three 
women passengers carried british passports but were living in 
norway the company said 
a west german navy vessel taking part in a nato sea exercise in 
the area at the time of the crash pulled 31 bodies from the water 
and brought them to hirtshals where danish officials began the task 
of identification rescue officials said previously that 32 bodies 
were recovered 
the usbuilt plane belonged to the norwegian partnair charter 
airline company 
in oslo the shipping company released the passenger list with 
the names of 38 men and 17 women 
the passengers most of the top management and half of the staff 
of wilhelmsen lines were chosen by lottery for the trip to see a 
ship christened in west germany company officials said 
this is unbelievable tragedy on what was supposed to be a day 
of celebration said leif terje loeddesoel president of wilh 
wilhelmsen ltd the shipping lines parent company 
next of kin many crying arrived at the concerns oslo office 
late friday and early today where a crisis team of pychologists and 
clergymen awaited them 
clusters of people whose friends worked for the company gathered 
outside its offices today waiting for a list of victims to be made 
public 
a norwegian air disaster commission was preparing to go to 
hirtshals to work with danish officials trying to determine the 
cause of the crash 
it would be pure speculation to say what caused the crash but 
whatever it was it must have happened very suddenly said rolf 
grimsrud director of the norwegian civil aviation technical 
division 
it could have been an explosion due to sabotage or something 
else or it could have lost a major surface such as a wing or the 
tail he said 
public radio quoted flight supervisor karl andersen at 
copenhagens kastrup airport as saying that parts of the plane might 
have broken off in midair 
the radar signal disappeared very suddenly from our screens 
and it the plane went down fast andersen was quoted as saying 
the convair probably disintegrated when it hit the water he 
added 
it was flying at an altitude of 23000 feet when air controllers 
at kastrup airport lost contact with it 
rescuers said most of the bodies were found within a radius of a 
few hundred yards which would appear to indicate that the plan did 
not explode in midair 
partnairs managing director syvar leivestad said a fishing 
boat picked up an underwater sonar echo that might be the wreckage 
but west german navy divers sent down to check could not confirm the 
report due to poor visibility 
the plane was built by general dynamics 35 years ago and its 
engines were refitted about 20 years ago 
one week ago it had undergone a fiveweek maintenance check in 
canada before going back into service at partnair 
despite being old our planes have less total mileage than many 
planes built in the 1970s leivestad said

known as ceylon by july 29 the second anniversary of the peace 
accord but gandhi refused saying a hasty withdrawal could lead to 
even more bloodshed 
the presence of indian soldiers became a point of contention 
between the two countries and resulted in a diplomatic deadlock that 
at one point threatened to snowball into an armed confrontation

senators are calling for use of force as a last 
resort to down planes delivering cocaine and national drug policy 
director william bennett isnt ruling out such a policy 
i agree with the sentiment expressed senator bennett said 
friday after sen mitch mcconnell rky and other lawmakers urged 
such action at a senate foreign relations committee session 
bennett stopped short of endorsing a mcconnell amendment that 
would provide law enforcement officials with such powers but 
acknowledged that the concept had appeal 
it is analogous to not identical to but analogous to it 
seems to me the authority we give a police officer in the inner 
city in this country to stop someone from speeding away in a four by 
four bennett said 
sen joseph biden ddel told the panel that if a drugrunning 
plane was ordered to land and refused to do so then as a last 
resort i think we should blow it out of the air 
at the hearing sen john kerry dmass questioned bennett 
about reports that there have been cutbacks in a miamibased program 
designed to ferret out moneylaundering drug kingpins operation 
greenback 
bennett said he was unaware of it but an aide bruce karnes 
said i have heard of it he said after the hearings that he had 
no details 
apparently there have been some cutbacks said john hanlon a 
spokesman for the internal revenue service which has been operating 
the program in conjunction with the justice department he said 
details would not be available immediately 
bennett said there was no plan to send us fighting troops to 
colombia to engage the cocaine cartel among other things he said 
colombian president virgilio barco does not want foreign troops in 
his country 
the same applied to any multinational military force designed to 
fight the drug lords bennett added 
he said that if colombia asked for troops to combat the cartel 
the united states would have to consider the request but he added 
that the possibility seemed remote and that there are no plans on 
the drawing board 
he said american officials aim to keep the several hundred us 
military advisers in colombia away from any hostilities but added 
that there could be no guarantee 
hostilities can break out anyplace he said

turned out of power last month after 45 
years of supreme rule the communist party is hunting for a new 
image and a program to win it a place in a more democratic poland 
everyone agrees it will not be easy 
as the first communist party in the east bloc to lose control of 
government it has few models to follow 
now its a not a question of following examples but setting 
examples said janusz kubasiewicz warsaw party chief and 
politburo member 
never accepted by most poles who viewed the party as a soviet 
puppet polish communism itself never really fit the rigid soviet 
mold 
the party grew out of the 1948 forced merger of the polish 
socialist party an authentic polish leftist movement and the 
promoscow polish workers party that replaced the polish party 
liquidated in the late 1930s on stalins orders 
after the war workers and students repeatedly challenged the 
partys authority in a series of bloody uprisings in 1980 the 
independent workers movement solidarity seriously eroded the 
partys legitimacy 
hundreds of thousands of party members joined solidarity and 16 
months later gen wojciech jaruzelski declared martial law to crush 
the movement and stop further decline in the party 
after labor unrest broke out in 1988 and the economy slid 
jaruzelski forced the party to agree to legalize solidarity again 
the april deal to legalize the union also called for solidarity to 
back partially free elections 
unionbacked candidates swept to victory and the communists 
suffered a humiliating defeat although guaranteed a majority in the 
sejm the powerful lower house of parliament the communists were 
unable to form a government 
on aug 24 solidarity adviser tadeusz mazowiecki was elected to 
lead polands first noncommunist government in 45 years 
in the past few months pragmatic party members have realized 
drastic changes are needed if the party is to recover 
one of the first tasks was to consider pruning the word communist 
from the lexicon 
our party must be a socialist party we must get away from the 
word communism because nobody knows what it means said newly 
elected central committee secretary marek krol from now on we 
must be a political party or its over 
other changes are also in the offing fifteen deputies on behalf 
of the communist parliamentary caucus have proposed removing the 
clause in the constitution that mandates that the communist party be 
the leading political force in society 
deputy sejm speaker tadeusz fiszbach says more such iniatitves 
are likely we dont want to be seen by the electorate as those 
who are blocking change 
but cosmetic changes are not enough for fiszbach he wants to 
ensure that the 173member communist caucus in parliament will play 
a role in shaping party policy rather than being just a tool of the 
central committee as in the past 
party leaders used to be seated in parliament but in june almost 
all top party candidates were defeated those elected feel they owe 
their election to the voters and not the party 
the party leadership has to seek our opinion we are not going 
to cooperate with them under a dictate said fiszbach former 
gdansk party leader who signed the agreements to legalize solidarity 
in 1980 and was stripped of his party positions for prosolidarity 
sympathies in 1982 
changing its name and initiating popular legislation may help the 
party but it is trying to change its image at a time that it will 
no longer have unlimited access to media 
mazowiecki intends to keep the powerful post of president of 
radio and television committee for solidarity 
the central committee has turned over its department of 
propaganda to krol who attracted attention as the editor of wprost 
a provocative party weekly in the western city of poznan 
he wants to depoliticize the partys newspaper trybuna ludu get 
internal party matters off the front page and develop interesting 
television programs 
we have to prove we can be attractive because biologically the 
party is dying he said 
party membership stands at about 21 million down more than a 
million from 1980 and the average age is 46 the oldest in its 
history and 176 percent of the members are retirees said an 
august article in the party weekly polityka 
membership slipped by 35000 in the first half of 1989 polityka 
said and party officials say they expect more members to quit 
one of the things party members are worried about are their jobs 
three out of four administrative jobs in poland are held by people 
who secured their positions through party patronage polityka said 
there are signs that some of those workers already may be in 
trouble the strike committee at a northeast poland meat packing 
plant called off a protest thursday after winning dismissal of the 
manager a party member according to a solidarity journalist 
present at negotiations 
some party members are reportedly securing their futures by 
converting governmentowned businesses into private businesses owned 
by them such conversions have been bitterly attacked in the 
prosolidarity press 
fiszbach says the party cannot win social support as long as its 
members retain privileges it cannot justify but he said other party 
members are determined to hang on to those perks 
such divisions threaten to split the party and there is talk that 
the party could splinter into two or three groups 
the question is what political orientation the party should 
adopt some favor becoming an orthodox communist party while others 
would prefer simply a broadbased social democratic party that could 
possibly attract even leftleaning members of solidarity

a highranking drug trafficker imprisoned 
for the past month at the height of the drug crackdown was released 
because authorities lacked an extradition request from the united 
states police said 
however a drug enforcement administration official in washington 
said the trafficker was not being sought in the united states 
the army said today it captured the four leading members of a 
cocaine death squad in the drug center of medellin and said the men 
also served as bodyguards for the wife of fugitive drug kingpin 
pablo escobar 
botogas el tiempo newspaper said today the army raided 30 sites 
in bogota and the rural town of pacho and seized 49 vehicles 
including two bulletproof mercedez benz sedans thought to belong to 
drug boss gonzalo rodriguez gacha 
in other developments 
the army said friday it had arrested the pilot of one of the 
nations top cocaine barons and that he had flown cocaine to the 
united states 
in medellin armed gangs wearing white hoods terrorized the 
embattled city friday setting fire to nine government vehicles 
including trucks and vans the gangs suspected of working for the 
drug lords hurled firebombs and fired shots in the air no injuries 
were reported and police arrested one man many businesses closed 
after receiving death threats over the telephone 
regarding the trafficker who was freed police identified him as 
a key aide to escobar and said he was released thursday because 
there was no arrest warrant legal paperwork or extradition request 
for him by the united states 
police col oscar pelaez carmona said the aide luis fernando 
galeano was held at an army base for a month after being arrested 
during a raid on a medellin office building believed to house money 
laundering operations pelaez said galeano also was arrested in 1988 
on charges of money laundering but had to be released because all 
the legal paperwork on him disappeared 
it was not known why his latest arrest was not made public either 
in colombia or the united states which is helping colombia with 
financial aid and military equipment in its war on drugs and seeking 
the extradition of top drug lords the government began the 
crackdown last month after a police chief a judge and a 
presidential candidate were killed in attacks blamed on dealers 
escobar who leads the united states mostwanted list is said 
to head a 3 billion worldwide cocaine empire the government of 
colombia has offered a 250000 reward for information leading to 
his arrest 
colombian newspapers have said galeano is a financial 
administrator for the medellin cartel and have linked him to the 
assassination of city councilman in the town of monteria and the 
attempted slaying of a man connected to a rival drug cartel in the 
city of cali 
in washington frank shultz a spokesman for the federal drug 
enforcement administration said galeano was not wanted in the 
united states and that there were no charges against him 
regarding the arrest of the death squad members the 4th army 
brigade in medellin said in a communique that the gang called 
love for medellin took its name from a local charitable 
organization and operated as a vigilante gang that killed suspected 
drug addicts prostitutes and homosexuals 
it did not say when the four men were captured but it said 
love for medellin frequently guarded maria victoria henao 
vallejo the wife of escobar alleged head of the medellin cocaine 
cartel 
the newspaper el tiempo said it received its information about 
the confiscation of the drug barons property from military sources 
the defense departments press office was closed for the weekend 
colombian military authorities earlier showed reporters documents 
attesting to vast holdings of rodriguez gacha in which the reputed 
drug boss now in hiding operated like a oneman multinational 
corporation 
the government using its emergency powers this week assigned a 
military officer to replace the elected mayor of pacho 50 miles 
northwest of bogota but it rescinded the action a few hours later 
after political parties said the move was unconstitutional 
the army announced friday it had arrested escobars pilot 
nicolas gonzalez cardona who allegedly flew cocaine to the united 
states the pilot was arrested in raids in the opening days of the 
crackdown 
the army said in a communique that gonzalez made international 
flights on one of the medellin cartels main routes between 
colombia miami and new york the cartel is believed to supply 80 
percent of the us cocaine supply

former president reagan was in excellent 
condition today after successful hourlong brain surgery to remove 
blood that accumulated following a horseback riding accident this 
summer spokesmen said 
president reagan is conscious and recovering in his room where 
he is comfortable and in good spirits mark weinberg said adding 
that the operation went without complications 
weinberg said friday he was unsure how long reagan would remain 
at st marys hospital which is part of the mayo clinic when the 
doctors tell him he can go home he will he said 
the chief surgeon dr thoralf m sundt would not comment on the 
operation or the outlook for recovery but weinberg said reagan was 
listed in excellent and stable condition after the onehour 
operation ended about 515 pm 
at midmorning today dr michael j ebersold a mayo clinic 
spokesman said reagans condition was unchaged describing it as 
stable he refused to elaborate 
nancy reagan spent the night in a room across the hall from her 
husband at the hospital 
weinberg said the 78yearold former president will be 
carefully monitored although no further treatment is anticipated 
henry brem a neurosurgeon at johns hopkins university hospital 
in baltimore who was not involved in the surgery said normal 
recovery periods for the type of operation reagan received include 
about a week of hospitalization 
the fluid on the upper right side of the brain blood that 
accumulated after reagan was bucked from a horse july 4 was found 
during a routine examination at mayo where the reagans have 
received annual checkups since their prewhite house days 
the decision to perform the surgery was made friday morning after 
doctors reviewed the results of a cat scan done thursday as a 
followup to the horseback riding accident weinberg said neither 
the former president nor mrs reagan objected to the surgery he 
said 
sundt an internationally renowned specialist in the human blood 
delivery system who also is editor of the journal of neurosurgery 
was assisted by two other mayo neurosurgeons an anesthesiologist 
and three nurses 
although reagan had not experienced any symptoms physicians had 
advised the fluid be removed by making a small burr hole in 
reagans skull and draining the fluid weinberg said the procedure 
was performed under a general anesthesia 
weinbergs description of the presidents problem as a subdural 
hematoma indicated the fluid had collected underneath the dura a 
membrane that covers the brain inside the skull a hematoma is a 
pool of blood as in a bruise 
a checkup at the clinic found the former president in otherwise 
good health 
president bush tried to phone his predecessor from air force one 
en route from new orleans to washington but reagan had already 
entered surgery 
i hope its all right pray its all right bush told 
reporters 
the reagans arrived wednesday in the southeastern minnesota town 
about 70 miles southeast of minneapolis and checked into the clinic 
thursday 
the horse riding accident happened while reagan was visiting the 
ranch of william wilson a friend near cananea mexico about 30 
miles south of the arizona border 
reagan was flown to an army hospital in arizona and kept about 
four hours declining a doctors suggestion that he remain overnight 
for observation he was described as suffering from scrapes and 
bruises 
during his two terms reagan was hospitalized several times 
recovering from various ailments at a speed doctors called 
impressive for a man his age 
on march 30 1981 reagan was wounded in an assassination 
attempt a bullet one inch from his heart was removed but by oct 
30 he was declared in excellent health on july 13 1985 he 
underwent successful surgery for cancer of the colon later 
examinations during the balance of his second term showed no 
recurrence 
he also had surgery during his second term for enlargement of the 
prostate for skin cancer and for dupuytrins contracture a 
condition that caused his left hand to curve inward

the great montana centennial cattle drive 
thundered into billings just after sunrise today as 2700 cattle and 
2400 riders moved slowly down main street in the morning chill 
the sound of hooves and the rumble of the ironshod wheels of 200 
covered wagons reverbrated along the threemile parade route 
thousands of people gathered before dawn to watch the procession 
led by a union cavalry unit and brought up by the mass of cattle 
the herd of largely longhorn cattle swept across the six lanes of 
the parade route nearly surrounded by the 105 drovers who had 
herded them over the plains during the past six days a few people 
reached out to touch the animals 
the sixday journey which began at roundup about 60 miles north 
of billings was to end tonight with a countrywestern concert 
the drive was part of montanas centennial celebration and also 
commemorated the great cattle drives of the last century which 
began when nelson story brought the first herd of texas longhorns to 
montana in 1866 
billings took extraordinary steps to welcome the sprawling 
caravan 
the us postal service suspended mail delivery in north billings 
for today and all offduty police officers and street sweepers were 
called in 
assistant city administrator john lawton also urged viewers to 
use extreme caution near the herd out of concern of a stampede 
no one can predict with certainty how the animals will react 
lawton said friday 
words of caution have been heard for days but the experienced 
wranglers tending the herd managed to head off any major problems on 
the trail 
trail boss jay stovall noting that he and 20 ranch hands 
routinely herd 3000 head of cattle between pastures on his ranch 
said having 100 top hands to handle the chore made the task simple 
if we had 100 people who didnt know what they were doing it 
would be way too many stovall said experienced hands 
anticipate problems before they happen 
thousands of billings residents greeted the travelers thursday at 
the fourthnight camp about 21 miles north of the city and created 
a mileslong traffic snarl 
cool gray skies and light rain hung over the drive friday 
morning as the participants began their last day on the trail but 
the mood was exuberant 
hundreds of cars trucks mobile homes and even buses lined us 
87 north of billings on friday afternoon as spectators again swarmed 
to watch the arrival of the wagon train and a couple of miles 
farther out the cattle herd 
the head of the column began to gather at a giant 
redandwhitestriped beer tent 
within minutes friday nights camp was set 
the cattle were led to a pasture near the highway and spectators 
climbed over and through a barbedwire fence to shake hands with the 
drovers

in waco violated her constitutional rights by failing to tell her 
about an unwritten policy that requires unmarried pregnant 
students to leave the school

in one of the ironic twists that could happen 
only in washington it appears the federal budget deficit is all 
that is standing in the way of killing a major social program 
catastrophic health insurance for retirees 
the way the government works repealing the program would worsen 
next years deficit by about 5 billion thats because taxes to 
finance catastrophic are being collected more quickly then benefits 
are being paid 
some who watch congress closely say that even the deficit problem 
is not enough to save the new insurance program they predict the 
house and senate will repeal it 
catastrophic which everyone eligible for medicare is required to 
buy is under attack from some retirees who already have such 
coverage and from some wealthier older americans who dont like 
having to buy coverage for those with lower incomes 
because of a barrage of complaints the house ways and means 
committee and the senate finance committee are making major changes 
in the program reducing benefits and cutting the surtax on 
higherincome retirees that provides most of the money but in ways 
and means especially there is heavy sentiment for repeal 
will the changes be enough to stave off repeal senate majority 
leader george j mitchell dmaine was asked 
i dont know that replied mitchell a member of the finance 
committee 
when senate republican leaders met with president bush at the 
white house last week they came down hard for repeal the 
administration wants no changes 
neither committee will advocate repeal because if it did so it 
would have to find about 5 billion of new taxes to prevent 
worsening of the deficit 
however when the hotly disputed issue reaches the floor of the 
house congressional aides predict most lawmakers will be unable to 
resist voting for repeal 
when the catastrophiccoverage law was enacted a year ago 
congress and the reagan administration agreed that it should be set 
up like an insurance program at least in the early years money to 
finance benefits would be collected at a faster pace than benefits 
would be paid out 
the first part of coverage went into effect this year providing 
some protection against expenses of a lengthy hospital stay 
doctors bills will be covered starting next year most prescription 
drugs will be covered starting in 1991 
some of the taxes and fees that finance catastrophic benefits are 
already being paid by retirees the biggest part of the bill will 
become due when tax returns are filed early in 1990 but for at 
least most of 1990 significantly less will be going out in benefit 
checks than is being paid in 
the office of management and budget estimates that if 
catastrophic coverage were repealed the 1990 deficit would be 
swollen by between 4 billion and 7 billion that would be enough 
under the grammrudman balancedbudget law to trigger automatic 
reductions in most federal programs 
but what is happening to those taxes and fees that retirees are 
paying for catastrophic coverage the money is being mixed with all 
other tax dollars in the treasury paying federal salaries buying 
weapons and fighting illegal drugs 
the money also is making the budget deficit look smaller than it 
is and thats another burr under the saddle of those who dont 
like the catastrophic program 
when omb deputy director william diefenderfer was asked about 
repeal at a finance committee session last week he replied any 
model ive seen for repeal increases the deficit therefore we 
would have to oppose it 
does this program make money demanded sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny is that why you want it 
diefenderfer hastened to add that bush likes the program for what 
it does for retirees 
but opponents of catastrophic coverage had another argument for 
repeal sen richard bryan dnev accused the administration of 
favoring the program as part of a strategy to balance the budget 
from the alreadyinadequate pensions of americas seniors

minutes after the senate appropriations 
committees decision last week to expand the smoking ban aboard 
airliners tobaccostate sen ernest hollings stood in a capitol 
corridor talking about the meeting 
interrupting the conversation a bald rotund man in a suit 
sauntered up from behind the lawmaker and reached out to shake his 
hand 
thanks on behalf of rj reynolds he told a smiling 
hollings dsc who had just been on the losing side of two votes 
aimed at diluting the prohibition it was a good try but it was 
stacked against us 
these are tough times on capitol hill for the rj reynolds 
tobacco co and the rest of the tobacco industry one of the most 
freespending lobbies in washington 
cigarette manufacturers find themselves puzzling over how to 
prevent congress from broadening the current ban on smoking on 
airline flights of two hours or less and they are clearly on the 
defensive 
the house voted aug 3 to make the restriction permanent thus 
preventing it from expiring next april the senate votes this week 
on even stronger language permanently prohibiting cigarette smoking 
on all domestic routes 
i dont know what well do said sen jesse helms rnc 
whose state leads the nation in tobacco production well do what 
we have to do 
helms doesnt rule out a filibuster protracted debate aimed at 
preventing a vote and smoking ban supporters say they expect one 
but other tobacco supporters concede that with the threat of 
higher excise taxes on tobacco products and restrictions on 
cigarette advertising always looming as a possibility an allout 
fight over smoking on airplanes might not be wise 
is this the place we really want to lay down the gauntlet or 
should we fight it out over taxes said sen wendell ford dky 
who represents the countrys no 2 tobaccogrowing state 
strategically you have to be careful you dont want to use all 
your chips up 
the tobacco lobby has lots of ammunition to use according to a 
survey by common cause the public interest lobbying group the 
cigarette business gave members of congress 261000 in speaking 
fees last year more than any other industry 
cigarette companies have also stepped up their efforts in recent 
years to politically mobilize smokers 
rj reynolds for example maintains lists of smokers it 
compiles from coupon rebates and other promotions and encourages 
them to form local smokers groups the company pays for a meeting 
space and provides refreshments literature and a videotape at the 
first meeting encouraging them to fight restrictions such as 
nosmoking areas and local cigarette taxes 
reynolds also mails smokers a newsletter six times per year 
called choice and it maintains a tollfree hotline that it 
encourages smokers to call when they hear of local anticigarette 
efforts that may be brewing 
we started the program because of the volume of mail we were 
getting from smokers telling us they feel like secondclass 
citizens said betsy annese reynolds spokeswoman in company 
offices in winstonsalem nc its all part of a program to help 
smokers regain the rights they feel have been taken away from them 
supporters of the airline smoking ban health groups and airline 
employee unions say that all of this leaves them outgunned 
there were two of us standing outside that room yesterday 
ban supporter jo ellen deutsch a lobbyist for the association of 
flight attendants said of thursdays senate appropriations 
committee meeting there were at least 30 tobacco people in that 
hallway 
nonetheless most participants say they expect some tougher 
version of the current restrictions to eventually become law 
advocates of the ban have several factors on their side 
including the fact that the author of the expanded restrictions in 
sen frank lautenberg dnj chairman of the appropriations 
transportation subcommittee few lawmakers care to challenge him and 
risk losing transportation projects for their districts 
the issue is also one that many lawmakers have intense personal 
feelings about because of their own experiences as smokers and 
because they spend long hours on airliners traveling to and from 
their districts 
you try at every turn because our constituents dont understand 
unless you fight at every turn said hollings but were in the 
minority position

cabinet nominees to the solidarityled 
government on saturday unveiled plans for a westernstyle tax system 
and a liberalized economy saying radical changes are crucial to 
removing the vestiges of communist control 
the proposals were outlined for members of parliament who will 
have final say on the new government proposed by prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki 
the 24member council or ministers or cabinet would include 12 
ministers clearly aligned with the solidarity labor movement the 
communists would get four posts although they have been guaranteed 
control of the key defense and interior ministries 
the shape of polands historic new government began to emerge as 
parliament members quizzed cabinet nominees on economic political 
and social issues 
we face an economic process unknown in history nobody ever 
tried to pass from the socialist economy to a freemarket economy 
said witold trzeciakowski a solidarity adviser nominated as 
chairman of the economic advisory council 
solidaritys leszek balcerowicz nominated as vice premier and 
finance minister outlined an overhaul in the tax system that 
includes lowering taxes on profits and instituting a progressive 
personal income tax and a valueadded tax a form of sales tax 
controls on wage inflation liberalizing foreign trade rules 
protecting the drain of goods and capital from poland and unifying 
the official and blackmarket currency exchange rates also will be 
part of the program he said 
the parliament committees which began the hearings friday have 
generally given favorable assessments 
the committee assessments are advisory and the final decision 
will be up to the sejm the powerful lower house of parliament which 
is to vote on the cabinet tuesday a solidarityled coalition 
controls the chamber and it is unclear how it will react to 
mazowieckis nominees who are considered compromise candidates to 
placate the communists 
by heading the interior and defense ministries the communists 
will retain control of the army and police although it remains 
unclear how much power mazowiecki will have to overrule individual 
ministries 
the army is a proreform institution gen florian siwicki a 
communist nominated to remain defense minister declared to one 
committee saturday 
gen czeslaw kiszczak mazowieckis predecessor as prime minister 
and his nominee to remain head of the interior ministry told a 
committee he will not nominate noncommunists as his deputies 
he said that would invite political discussions making it 
difficult to execute his powers but he added that he wants the 
ministry independent of party control and he will be loyal to 
mazowiecki 
also joining mazowieckis proposed government are the peasant 
party and democratic party former communist party allies who 
shifted allegiance to solidarity and creating a coalition strong 
enough to convince the communists to cede control 
peasant party members have been nominated to four posts and 
democrats to three 
the foreign minister nominee lawyer krzysztof skubiszewski is 
considered an independent although he is friendly toward solidarity 
skubiszewski said he would like his foreign ministry to open a 
very difficult matter amd make possible the return of deported 
poles forced to remain in the soviet union after world war ii 
jacek kuron a veteran opposition activist nominated as labor 
minister said the law on strikes would be amended to simplify the 
procedure for staging a legal work stoppage while introducing the 
principle that no wages are paid to strikers 
because of the disparate and stillevolving elements in polands 
embryonic government officials have cautioned that compromises and 
debates in the coming days still could alter the makeup of the 
government that mazowiecki has proposed 
despite the western slant the new government may take the 
communist party will still wield considerable economic power through 
president wojciech jaruzelski who appointed politburo member 
wladyslaw baka as president of the national bank of poland 
newspapers reported saturday 
but the communists will no longer control the vast minsterial 
bureaucracies they have run since 1948 mazowiecki has promised 
personnel decisions based on competence not a witch hunt 
solidarity leader lech walesa who put together the coalition 
that elected mazowiecki was maintaining a distance from the 
historic changes in keeping with his role as opposition figure he 
said he will not be pulling the strings from behind the scenes 
no i am out he told the state news agency pap i am 
interested only in pluralism freedom and democracy and when 
everything works i am really going on vacation i will not enter 
the government

for most of its 40 years in power the 
ruling nationalist party has maintained that when the people of 
mainland china rose up taiwan would attack and win back its right 
to rule 
but in april may and june when china was rocked by 
prodemocracy demonstrations the nationalists dropped the idea that 
taiwan could govern the mainland 
that was part of taiwans complex reaction to the repression in 
beijing a reaction that highlights the aboutface taiwan has made 
since the death of generalissimo chiang kaishek 
the political opposition provided another example during the few 
years since political debate has been allowed in taiwan opposition 
politicians have advocated the declaration of a taiwan independent 
from the mainland 
but after the brutal crackdown in beijing just when the time 
seemed right the opposition changed its tune 
talk of independence was placed on the back burner as the 
opposition pushed for further democratic reforms on this island of 
20 million 
once known for its rabid anticommunism taiwan is now famous for 
its powerhouse economy once notorious for its jackboot security 
agencies the island now has a lively political scene which is 
evolving towards democracy 
among the common people reaction to events in china was a 
contradictory mixture of detachment and pain donations of blood and 
millions of dollars which never made it to china coincided with 
celebrations of a new stock market high 
the massacre in beijing has showed us we cannot be part of the 
communists but we also cannot be rid of them said hsiao 
hsiahuang professor of sociology at taiwan university we have 
different societies but we are still chinese 
for the ruling nationalist party the trouble in china helped 
solidify the most important policy change since martial law was 
lifted in 1987 after 38 years 
on june 3 as chinese troops used tear gas for the first time in 
40 years in beijing taiwan president lee tenghui abandoned a 
decadesold myth that taiwan can govern china 
we must have the courage to face the fact that at this moment 
we are unable to effectively exercise the right to govern the 
mainland lee told a meeting of party leaders 
for the bulk of their 40 years in power the nationalists under 
chiangs leadership had vowed to invade the mainland once the 
chinese rose up 
lee instead committed the island to a pragmatic foreign policy 
designed to compete with beijing for international recognition on 
july 20 the policy had its first big success when taiwan 
established relations with grenada making the caribbean nation the 
first country with ties to both beijing and taipei although china 
later severed its ties 
on the ideological front the crackdown in beijing gave taiwan 
an opportunity to vindicate what weve been saying for 40 years 
said ma yingjeou a rising star in the ruling party and head of the 
cabinets mainland affairs council 
but that opportunity wasnt seized 
the party issued several lackluster statements and organized 
demonstrations among university students to support the democracy 
movement but government officials closed a democracy wall at 
taiwan university once criticism turned to taiwan 
a hong kong activist said taiwan refused to help him smuggle 
chinese dissidents from the mainland and a government source said 
taiwans military on quemoy island turned back a chinese student who 
rowed there and claimed he had participated in the prodemocracy 
movement 
while other countries imposed sanctions taiwan took no measures 
to limit its blossoming contact with the mainland instead less 
than a week after the massacre taiwan opened direct mail and 
telephone links for the first time since 1949 
the government policy was based on its security concerns 
said jaw shaukang a nationalist legislator they fear the 
communists so they were very careful i personally think we could 
have done more 
some observers say the government appeared uncomfortable 
criticizing china for human rights violations when taiwans 
increasingly lively press is willing to expose the skeletons in the 
nationalists own closet 
indeed after the crackdown opposition politicians and 
intellectuals filled newspapers with essays and letters calling on 
the government to quicken the pace of democratic reforms in taiwan 
if those students who marched to tiananmen square came to 
taiwan i believe they would also demonstrate editor antonio 
chiang wrote in the journalist taiwans leading news magazine 
chaing said the only thing taiwan could do in response to the 
massacre was to democratize 
following the lead of their beijing classmates taiwan high 
school students put up posters calling for the withdrawal of 
military officers stationed in every school on the island 
authorities ripped them down 
as chinese dissident liu binyan and student leader wuer kaixi 
were heading overseas was the nationalist party thinking about 
letting its own blacklisted dissidents return opposition leader 
lin chengchieh wrote in the china times 
despite the debate many observers said they didnt think the 
stronger calls would spark faster change 
the nationalists can relax because they know that no matter 
what they do theyre still better than the communists said 
chiang of the journalist 
add to that the confusion the crackdown caused among the 
opposition and the case for quickened reform seems even weaker 
before june 3 many in the opposition felt that taiwan should 
declare independence from china and abandon the one china policy 
pursued by chiang kaishek and his nationalist allies 
but china has warned taiwan that it risks invasion if the island 
declares independence after the crackdown many activists began to 
take the threat seriously 
if they are crazy enough to shoot their own people they might 
be crazy enough to attack us said lu yu a top official in the 
opposition democratic progressive party 
since the nationalists retreated to taiwan in 1949 after losing a 
civil war to communist forces on the mainland taiwan and china have 
had little to do with each other 
but in the 1980s the two sides began to edge closer china began 
opening to the west taiwan allowed its people to travel to china 
and invest in the mainlands reforming economy beginning last year 
taiwanese journalists were welcomed on the mainland 
the crackdown came as the two sides were just getting to know 
each other 
things were just getting better between all of us and then 
this had to happen said lee yingshih a noodle stall operator 
who returned to nanjing last year for the first time since 1949

the families of the 47 sailors killed in an 
explosion aboard the uss iowa last spring stand little chance of 
winning compensation by suing the navy legal experts say 
its like rolling huge boulders uphill to try to sue the 
military for this kind of thing said paul rothstein a georgetown 
university law professor 
because all the victims were on active duty they have zero 
chance of prevailing in a lawsuit against the federal government 
regardless of the cause said eugene fidell a washington lawyer 
specializing in military affairs 
he noted that the families of the victims are entitled to 
standard death benefits from the government and that most members of 
the military take out a 50000 life insurance policy those 
payments however likely would be a fraction of the typical jury 
award in cases of alleged civilian negligence 
the pentagon in its report thursday on the april 19 gun turret 
explosion that claimed the lives of 47 sailors said circumstantial 
evidence indicated gunners mate clayton m hartwig intentionally 
caused the blast 
hartwigs family says the navy is trying to make him the 
scapegoat for its own negligence 
the pentagon report cited other problems on the iowa such as 
sailors not trained fully in firing procedures but officials ruled 
out those deficiencies as a cause of the blast 
and legal experts said the pentagon has no direct financial 
incentive to place the blame on hartwig 
the question that occurs as a policy matter is should these 
victims in military catastrophes receive something more than the 
usual compensation fidell said 
the supreme court in a 1950 decision that has come to be known 
as the feres doctrine gave the government sweeping protection from 
lawsuits by members of the military injured on active duty 
the court by a 54 vote in 1988 extended that shield to 
military contractors in most cases as it threw out a 725000 jury 
award to the family of a marine helicopter copilot killed in a 1983 
crash when he was unable to open an escape hatch 
the court said in that case a military contractor is protected 
from being sued when the product it sells conforms to reasonably 
precise pentagon specifications and the government is warned about 
any known potential dangers 
thus even if the pentagon had concluded the gun and ammunition 
aboard the iowa were defective there might be little grounds for a 
successful suit against any military contractors 
while military victims of disasters have little legal recourse 
against the government or its agents political factors sometimes 
come into play 
for example the families of some of the seven astronauts who 
died in the 1986 space shuttle challenger explosion were granted 
millions of dollars in a settlement with the government and morton 
thiokol manufacturer of the shuttles booster rockets 
that had to do with politics rather than law said rothstein 
the government wanted to keep the space program sympathetic to the 
american people it would have had a good case to resist paying 
anything 
while congress allows the government to be sued in some cases 
there is little indication it is willing to lower the military 
immunity shield put in place by the 1950 high court ruling 
but the iowa explosion is causing concern on capitol hill 
rep mary rose oakar dohio noted that the pentagon report 
cited navy shortcomings without exploring them fully 
the report gives a lot of detail on hartwig while leaving 
many questions about navy failures open she said i really do 
hope theyre not sweeping things under the carpet

the specter of world hunger is moving nearer as 
the population grows and the land loses its capacity to grow enough 
food to keep pace says lester r brown head of worldwatch 
institute 
with more hungry people in the world today than when this 
decade began theres little to celebrate on the food front as we 
enter the 90s he said 
brown in a world watch magazine report released saturday said 
he sees no surefire way to boost global food production enough in 
the 1990s to keep pace with expected population growth 
the only reasonable goal will be to try and cut population 
growth in half by the end of the century essentially what japan 
did in the 50s and what china did in the 70s he said 
but reaching that goal will be perhaps more demanding than 
anything the international community has ever undertaken brown 
added 
for the united states the obvious first step is to restore its 
funding of the united nations population fund and international 
planned parenthood federation which was canceled several years ago 
in response to pressures from the political right he said 
the united states halted its support for the un agency in 1986 
given the link between population growth and environmental 
degradation president george bush cannot credibly call himself an 
environmentalist if funding is not resumed brown said in the 
process the united states could reinvigorate the international 
family planning effort 
last may the united nations population fund said that unless 
women win more access to birth control education and employment 
the worlds population could almost triple to 14 billion by the year 
2100 
dr nafis sadik executive director of the un agency said the 
worlds population now at 52 billion may be held to 10 billion in 
the next century if family planners succeed in reducing birth rates 
in pulling its funding for the un agency the reagan 
administration contended it promoted coercive abortion but mrs 
sadik said the reasons were political she said movements such as 
religious fundamentalism seem to be designed to somehow keep women 
in bondage 
she expressed hope the bush administration would resume the us 
contribution 
however the bush administration has continued reagans policy of 
not funding the agencies based on the idea that no federal funds 
should be spent for population control that involves abortion 
brown whose private nonprofit worldwatch institute for years 
has espoused population control as part of its research and policy 
recommendations said some progress has been made in scaling back 
birth rates from about 2 percent annually in 1970 to 17 percent 
this year 
however this decline has been so slow the annual incremental 
increase is actually going up he said the world is now projected 
to add 921 million people during the 1990s the largest increment 
ever for a decade 
in many developing countries soaring population now has a dual 
effect on food balance brown said it increase demand as it 
degrades the agricultural resource base 
for instance crowded cities and villages create a need for 
firewood that exceeds the sustainable yield of local forests 
deforestation is the outcome which in turn increases rainfall 
runoff and soil erosion 
brown said soil erosion tops the list of enviromental trends that 
threaten humankind other hazards include air pollutions damage to 
crops and its longterm effect on climate 
last years drought in the united states and its lingering 
effects in some areas reduced world grain output even with larger 
crops this year global stockpiles are still short brown said 
with reduced output world grain prices rose by roughly onehalf 
from july 1987 to july 1988 and have remained relatively high since 
he said 
for many heavily indebted third world countries rising grain 
prices are combining with falling personal incomes to pose a policy 
dilemma brown said price hikes are needed to stimulate output 
and encourage additional investment by farmers but the worlds poor 
cant cope easily 
perhaps a billion or more of the worlds people already spend 
70 percent of their income on food for many in this group a 
dramatic rise in the cost of grain is life threatening 
in the united states a 1 loaf of bread contains only about five 
cents worth of wheat if the price of wheat were to double the 
price of the loaf would increase to only 105 brown said but in 
poor countries where wheat is bought at local markets and ground 
into flour at home a doubling of wheat prices means a doubling of 
bread prices 
a food price rise that is merely annoying to the worlds 
affluent can drive consumption below the survival level among the 
poor he said

hungary is seeking a military accord 
with yugoslavia and austria the first time a warsaw pact nation has 
sought to forge such an agreement with nations that do not belong to 
the sovietled alliance 
communist party chief rezsoe nyers unveiled the proposal friday 
that includes creation of a security zone with the two neighbors 
that would be free of warsaw pact tanks 
nyers also said he would remove 14 of the 28 nuclear launching 
pads in hungary to reduce military costs and improve relations with 
the west 
the proposal awaits formal government adoption before being 
presented to austria and yugoslavia but he and other communist 
leaders consulted with the two neighboring countries before 
presenting it friday nyers said 
we consulted with vienna and belgrade and received favorable 
feedback he said during a news conference in the capital 
the reformist leader said he would ask the soviet union to pull 
out two armored battalions 72 tanks from a planned security zone 
that hungary envisions establishing with neutral austria and 
nonaligned yugoslavia 
the initiative illustrates the great changes in the soviet bloc 
since soviet president mikhail s gorbachev took power in 1985 
as a member of the warsaw pact alliance hungary normally acts in 
concert with its six military allies nyers said moscow had been 
consulted on parts of the plan that directly involve the soviet 
union but neighboring czechoslovakia and romania which also are 
allied were not 
the present foreign policy doctrine of the warsaw pact allows 
for independent initiatives by member countries he told 
reporters nyers was apparently alluding to a warsaw pact meeting in 
july that ended with the seven member nations pledging to let each 
go their own way 
hungary plans multiparty elections by june the first since it 
became a communist country the nation is at odds with the rigid 
communist leadership of romania and czechoslovakia over political 
ecologial and human rights issues 
its plan to unilaterally improve military ties with its 
nonwarsaw pact neighbors was likely to worsen tensions with those 
communist allies 
nyers proposal includes 
halving the number of launching pads capable of delivering 
nuclear devices 
calling on the soviet union to withdraw two armored battalions 
from a 35mile buffer zone along common borders with austria and 
yugoslavia and scrapping 200 hungarian tanks now in the zone 
asking austria and yugoslavia to declare security zones on their 
sides of the border expanding the common buffer zone to 60 miles 
providing information on the size and location of forces within 
the zone 
limiting the frequency and size of military maneuvers and 
allowing military observers from the two neighboring countries to 
attend such exercises 
nyers also proposes that the three countries join forces to limit 
and reduce militaryrelated nuclear activities to ban chemical 
weapons and to explore jointly cutting military expenditures 
nyers offered no further details about the location of the 
nuclear launch bases or the range of missiles they could be used for 
hungary in may removed its border fortications with austria 
allowing thousands of east bloc residents to flee to the west 
hungary like poland is embarking on a wide range of liberal 
economic and political reforms and is seeking closer ties to the 
west to bolster its economy

national public radio is taking a new hard line 
on sports 
if sports news is important it gets on the air if it isnt it 
doesnt 
pete roses gambling woes were important at npr as were the 
death of major league baseball commissioner bart giamatti and firing 
of dallas cowboys football caoch tom landry 
until recently nprs popular morning edition show may have 
tossed such stories into short hourly compilations of scores and 
games results that often are called the ghetto approach to radio 
sports coverage 
not now 
sports today is no longer scores says robert ferrante 
executive producer of morning edition which has dropped its 
hourly sports updates and now lets sports compete for airtime with 
other types of news 
npr a nonprofit private corporation that provides national 
programming and support for 377 stations nationwide is touting its 
different kind of news in its first multimedia campaign for 
morning edition and all things considered 
local tv stations are playing sprightly animated ads for the 
shows and national and regional magazines are scheduled to carry 
print ads as part of a drive to expand the audience of 6 million who 
are attracted to npr news shows npr spokeswoman cate cowan said 
the 10yearold morning edition is an eclectic mix of 
indepth news arts business political and science features and 
interviews hosted by bob edwards it still has segments by veteran 
sportscasters red barber and bill littlefield but it no longer 
locks sports into hourly 3minute slots 
it was too restrictive it didnt give due attention to sports 
as part of the culture of this country ferrante said in an 
interview last week 
the allegations that rose baseballs alltime hit leader and 
manager of the cincinnati reds bet on the game was a morality 
play for america ferrante said 
giamattis unexpected death a week after he barred rose from 
baseball is probably as important to a larger section of america 
as any national leader ferrante added 
the part that sports plays in our culture is a news story and 
should be judged the same way as other news stories ferrante 
added sports is news sports is fitness sports is health sports 
today rarely reflect the outcome of the game 
ferrante said scores now are delivered once on morning 
edition as a quick measurement of sports activity but he 
denied that npr was rolling back its sports coverage 
the features by barber and littlefield still air in the old 
sports time slot and still are among the most popular features on 
morning edition ferrante said the other sports carried 
throughout the broadcast means more airtime for sports he said 
since june 19 there have been 120 sports stories on morning 
edition he said 
the change appears to have been well received at public stations 
i think its a good idea to treat sports news as news when it 
is news rather than ghettoize it said iris adler news director 
of public station wburfm in boston our listeners tune in for 
news and information i dont think they listen to us for one type 
of news or feature story all they want is quality 
im happy with the change said carol pierson program 
director for all news station kqedfm in san francisco i think 
its more logical to treat topics according to their news importance 
rather than dedicating a specific amount of time to a particular 
topic 
pierson said a lot of public stations previously cut out the 
hourly npr sports segment to broadcast local news or sports and 
we were one of them so id say sports is now getting on our air 
more than it was before 
she noted nprs new approach was more in line with sports 
coverage on the major tv networks 
you hear sports news if it is important and none if it 
isnt she said 
the change was not without its critics edwards the affable host 
of morning edition thinks it was a bad idea although he 
admitted his probably was a minority view at npr 
he said listeners dont know when to tune in for the sports 
edwards said a recent gallup poll conducted for npr mostly on 
morning edition showed our listeners dont care much for 
sports so sports news should be placed where those who are 
interested can find it 
sports fans expect to hear sports where theyve always heard 
sports and people who dont like sports feel the rest of the news 
is being trivialized by having sports in that slot he said 
edwards said listeners sort of plan their activities around 
certain segments of the show oh thats afghanistan i can 
shower now

indicated it would like to exchange the iranian for a jailed briton 
the foreign office said it will release kourosh fouladi a former

bombing attempt and sentenced to 10 years in jail authorities said 
two of fouladis accomplices were killed in the explosion in west

however foreign office minister william waldegrave said earlier 
this year there was no provision in british law for exchanging 
fouladi for cooper

anonymity said the iranians release has absolutely nothing to 
do with cooper 
a spokesman for the home office speaking about fouladis 
release said saturday he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years 
which he has now served taking into account normal remission which 
is available to any prisoner he will now be deported to iran

the number of east germans waiting in 
shelters swelled to nearly 7000 saturday as more refugees poured 
into hungary in hopes of being included in a mass migration to west 
germany 
seventy refugees fled from the camps to austria overnight but 
hungary was forced to open two new makeshift shelters to accommodate 
the estimated 200 east germans who continue to arrive in hungary 
each day 
there are now almost 7000 east germans waiting for word that 
hungary will become the first east bloc government to help the 
citizens of another communist nation go west hungarian red cross 
leader csilla von boeselager said saturday 
they were being housed in tent communities and boarding houses in 
budapest and in a summer camp taken over by nearly 2000 refugees on 
the shores of lake balaton 
refugees who talked to reporters saturday appeared hopeful they 
could leave early next week they were reacting to reports from 
hungarys communist party president rezso nyers and west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher that the refugees will be 
taken to west germany soon 
we can pack our few things together any moment and leave 
said one east german who refused to give his name lets hope its 
soon 
red cross officials who requested anonymity said it was still not 
clear whether the refugees would be taken in buses trains or their 
own cars 
austrian railroad officials said more than a week ago that they 
had 50 rail cars ready to go if they got word that a freedom 
train would take the east germans from hungary across austria to 
tent cities in bavaria 
the east germans have ridden a roller coaster of emotions in the 
past 10 days initial optimism gave way to disillusionment when top 
hungarian officials said the situation might take weeks to resolve 
hungary has been caught between the two germanys in the crisis 
it is anxious to prove to bonn that budapest has a new commitment to 
western concepts of human rights but fearful of deepening an 
ideological rift with the hardline communists in east berlin under 
a longstanding bilateral agreement hungary is obliged to return 
home east germans fleeing to the west 
the camps meanwhile have celebrated at least two baptisms and 
one wedding andras kovacs an official at the largest budapest 
facility said in an interview that the unidentified bride at one 
wedding was so grateful for the shelter she received that she gave 
her bouquet to camp officials 
six thousand east germans have fled over the border with austria 
since hungary began dismantling fortifications along the divide in 
may seventy more arrived in austria early saturday after trudging 
through territory that still contains barbed wire flares and other 
remnants of the iron curtain 
red cross officials noted the number was down from the 100 or so 
who arrived the night before and they attributed the decrease to 
growing optimism in the camps that the refugees will be taken to 
west germany

billy and cole neer two little boys with 
a passion for baseball hunted for golf balls outside a driving 
range near their home selling them back for a penny apiece and 
spending the proceeds on baseball cards 
on labor day they told their father they were going out to look 
for more golf balls hours later the boys age 10 and 11 were 
found stabbed to death in a nearby park 
they were pretty quiet and real polite recalled chad johns 
19 a clerk at diamond kings baseball card co a tiny shop the 
brothers had frequented they wouldnt interrupt when you were 
helping somebody else 
how could somebody murder two little kids like that johns 
asked 
that question is heard often in the cafes stores churches and 
schools in this verdant columbia river city of 46000 
autopsies showed billy died of a stab wound in the abdomen and 
cole of a stab wound in the chest police said both boys had been 
stabbed repeatedly though there was no evidence they had been 
molested or tortured 
the boys were buried saturday at their birthplace in north dakota 
as police search for leads school counselors are busy soothing 
the fears and grief of schoolmates and other children counselors 
and parents are warning their children to beware of strangers and to 
stay away from isolated areas 
the boys bodies were found in david douglas park which they 
often cut through to get to the driving range said their father 
clair neer 
the wooded hilly park often a place of shouting children 
mothers with babies joggers and bicyclists but on a sunny 
afternoon four days after the bodies were found few ventured there 
except police on small motorcycles 
there is widespread shock at the brutality and senselessness of 
the killings and there is anger too said linda herrington a 
spokeswoman for the vancouver school district 
children have lost their freedom to explore and enjoy the 
outdoors she said and that is a real loss 
the kids are telling us im scared maybe this will happen to 
me too said syreece mclean a school counselor parents are 
turning out by the score to walk their children to schools she said 
parents must confront the fact that crime they read about in the 
newspaper can happen even in a peaceful community like this one 
herrington said 
this kind of thing just doesnt happen in vancouver said 
police capt ray anderson 
we dont know who did this but ive got to think that the 
killer had something really wrong with him anderson said good 
lord to go out and kill 10 and 11yearold boys 
he said police have no motive for the killings and no suspects 
on friday vancouver detectives contacted fbi agents in 
washington dc and received an initial psychological profile of a 
possible killer anderson said that was helpful but he would 
release no details detectives also combed david douglas park again 
during the weekend to make sure they missed no evidence 
the boys father told the columbian newspaper he also is 
convinced the boys were killed by an awful sick person a 
stranger 
clair neer 35 a single parent and unemployed automobile glass 
repairman moved with his surviving son richard 6 across the

an estimated 200 people attended funeral services for the boys

of about 200 near the fort totten indian reservation where the boys 
were born their caskets were covered with star quilts an indian 
funeral tradition their mother is a member of the devils lake sioux 
tribe 
the rev kevin brown called the slayings a tragic injustice 
but said christians believe hope comes even through tragedy brown

doctors said they have decided to place a temporary pacemaker to 
help the ailing heart of the frail 79yearold nun who has 
dedicated her life to the destitute and dying 
officials at woodlands nursing home where mother teresa was 
admitted tuesday refused to elaborate or say whether they already 
implanted the pacemaker in a statement they said the nun is not 
responding to medication 
her rising temperature and irregularity of pulse is causing 
anxiety the statement said 
mother teresa became ill sept 3 and was admitted to the 
hospitals intensive care unit last tuesday she suffered a heart 
attack on friday but doctors had said her condition had stabilized 
and she was improving 
saturdays statement said mother teresa spent a sleepless 
night friday but rested throughout the day saturday

the supreme courts decision on flag burning is 
steadily fading from the forefront of public concern but lawmakers 
returning from a summer recess say it remains a political powder keg 
as they deal with the matter this week 
the issue that has been made such a major issue in washington 
is on the wane across the country said rep vic fazio dcalif 
it is beginning to be seen in perspective now people believe it 
was overblown 
its an abstraction to most people said rep phil crane 
rill who personally has ever witnessed a flag burning it 
does not have except through some veterans organizations a 
specific hardcore constituency 
even so leadership aides in both parties predict lawmakers will 
move quickly this fall to pass legislation to outlaw burning and 
other acts of flag desecration if only to take the steam out of 
president bushs drive for constitutional amendment to do the same 
thing 
top democratic leaders in both houses back the legislative 
approach in part out of fear that outright opposition would leave 
them vulnerable to criticism from republicans in the 1990 
congressional elections 
the issue arose when the supreme court ruled june 21 that burning 
the flag could be free speech protected by the first amendment that 
triggered a wave of outrage including bushs call for a 
constitutional amendment many veterans groups including the 
american legion want the change written into the bill of rights to 
make it safe from any future court ruling 
the house will be the first to address the issue when it takes up 
a bill on tuesday that would impose fines and up to a year in prison 
for physically desecrating a flag an approach supporters say should 
be at least tried before seeking to amend the constitution 
lawmakers just back to work after a month at home agreed passions 
on the issue have cooled over the summer 
i did not have one single person bring it up said rep beryl 
anthony dark 
i think the momentum to build up to a constitutional amendment 
has diminished substantially said rep mike synar dokla who 
held 63 meetings with constituents during august a statute will 
suffice even veterans groups are telling me right now they 
think a statutes sufficient 
rep olympia snowe rmaine who supports the amendment agreed 
if a statute can address the problem that will take care of the 
issue she said 
but republicans are betting lawmakers will vote for any measure 
that would protect the flag fearing any no vote could be turned 
by an opponent into a 30second political attack ad 
im going to support whatever comes up said rep claude 
harris dala im not going to be in a situation of voting 
against anything that would punish someone for violating the flag 
whether it be a statute or a constitutional amendment 
my sense is that people are concerned that republicans will use 
the issue in the same unprincipled but politically effective way in 
which they used the pledge of allegiance against democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis last year said rep ted weiss 
dny 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine already has 
promised a vote on legislation as well as the amendment in october 
and late last week house democratic leaders were discussing a 
similar agreement with republicans 
democratic sources said leaders in the majority were prepared to 
allow a house vote on a constitutional amendment sometime after the 
senate acts on it if republicans would support the statutory measure 
that comes to the floor tuesday 
the measure was tentatively scheduled to be brought up under an 
expedited process normally reserved for noncontroversial bills 
that means it would require a twothirds majority to pass 
opponents of the constitutional amendment including house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash apparently are gambling passage of 
statutory flag protection will defuse the issue and indeed many 
lawmakers said thats exactly what they heard back home 
they constituents want to stop the burning of the american 
flag and they dont care how we do it up there in congress said 
rep sonny montgomery dmiss a primary sponsor of the 
constitutional amendment

doctors in cape town said they 
have treated children as young as four years old with gunshot 
wounds which relatives said were inflicted by police during 
election violence 
police said saturday they used pistols birdshot rubber bullets 
and tear gas to disperse mobs overnight and saturday morning in 
mixedrace townships near cape town where violence has been 
reported since wednesdays elections the elections excluded south 
africas 28 million black majority 
also saturday the national union of mineworkers said three black 
mineworkers were shot to death by private security guards in a 
protest related to the elections mine owners said the workers 
attacked the guards 
it is extremely saddening to find children caught up in the 
firing line said dr david bass head of the red cross childrens 
hospital trauma unit he said 10 children aged four to 12 had been 
treated there for birdshot or buckshot wounds on election day 
bass was one of 75 cape town area doctors who issued a statement 
late friday describing the injuries to children as barbaric and 
stomachturning 
police issue daily unrest reports which give few details but 
their extensive listing of more than 300 incidents from wednesday 
through friday do not refer to any children being hurt by police 
action 
to apportion blame without being there is very difficult but 
to have buckshot and birdshot fired into crowds where there were 
women and children present points to questionable responsibility 
bass said 
relatives of injured children have alleged that police shot them 
he described some of his patients in an interview with the 
independent south african press association 
one of them a fouryearold girl has birdshot inside her 
skull another eightyearold girl has an eye injury and wounds to 
her limbs and trunk a 12yearold boy was shot in the leg foot and 
buttocks said bass 
the ministry of law and order has disputed the claims of 
antiapartheid activists clerics doctors journalists and township 
residents who have reported indiscriminate police firing in the cape 
town area during elections for parliamentary seats reserved for 
whites mixedrace and asians blacks have no voice in national 
affairs 
cape town attorney essa moosa said friday that 29 people were 
killed on election night he was referring to reports from 
mortuaries doctors relatives and an ambulanceman 
most were killed by police moosa said but some were involved in 
factional fighting which he and other activists said was instigated 
by police 
police have not acknowledged killing anyone although they say 15 
people died and 26 policemen were injured they have reported only a 
handful of civilian injuries from police shootings on election day 
while cape town activists and doctors have reported up to 200 
on saturday police said in a statement that they fired pistols 
birdshot rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse stonethrowers who 
damaged vehicles in four mixedrace townships overnight and saturday 
morning pistols with live ammunition sometimes are used to fire 
warning shots 
no injuries were reported as a result of police action since 
wednesday said the statement 
one mixedrace man was hurt in a stoning incident and four were 
arrested for stoning a delivery vehicle the statement said 
in johannesburg meanwhile the general mining union corp said 
three people were killed and 11 injured friday night when a crowd 
armed with sharpened sticks and knives attacked security guards at a 
workers hostel at kinross gold mine in evander 60 miles east of 
johannesburg 
but the national union of mineworkers said the company used 
live bullets to intimidate union members who had been involved in 
protest action against the general election and management were 
using mine security to assault workers taking part in a nationwide 
work stoppage 
the union said security guards opened fire on workers who wanted 
to ask them to stop the assaults killing the three

plo leader yasser arafat will fly to 
new york to call on the un general assembly to convene an 
international peace conference on the middle east a newspaper 
quoted him saturday as saying 
last year washington denied arafat a visa prompting the world 
body to move to geneva to hear the palestinian leader 
i am going to new york to discuss the convening of the 
international conference on middle east peace arafat was quoted 
as telling the daily newspaper asharq alawsat 
arafat appeared confident he will be allowed to enter the united 
states to address the united nations later this month 
mark dillen a state department spokesman said saturday that 
as far as we know he has made no visa application 
on friday israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin told reporters 
after a meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii that his 
government would view issuance of a us visa to arafat very 
gravely 
during last years session in geneva the 60yearold arafat 
openly renounced terrorism and recognized israels right to exist 
encouraging the united states to end a 13year ban on dealings with 
the palestine liberation organization and to begin a dialogue with 
the movement 
asharq alawsat said it interviewed the palestinian leader in 
belgrade yugoslavia this week during a summit of 102 nonaligned 
nations he said he was heading to new york with the leaders of 
the nine states who met on sidelines of the nonaligned summit 
conference to discuss the international peace conference with 
the un secretarygeneral and the permanent members of the security 
council 
egypt is spearheading arab efforts to persuade washington not to 
block arafats intended visit despite pressures by israel 
palestinian sources have said arafat would offer new peace proposals 
in his address 
arafat told asharq alawsat that convening an international 
conference as envisaged by arab leaders is not going to be easy as 
some might think because nothing comes on a silver platter 
he said he discussed the issue with un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar at the belgrade summit that ended friday 
arafat charged the united states is proving intransigent in 
the peace process by ignoring arab proposals and supporting only 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs election plan 
a palestinian uprising funded and largely directed by the plo 
has been under way in the west bank and gaza strip for 21 months 
resulting in the deaths of more than 550 palestinians and more than 
35 israelis 
the plo has rejected shamirs proposal for elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip to allow palestinians to choose 
their own representatives to negotiate with israel arafat insists 
on an israeli withdrawal from the territories and international 
supervision of these elections 
but arafat said he has detected positive indicators on the 
horizon because president bush has referred to the need to end the 
israeli occupation and secretary of state james a baker iii has 
spoken of something similar

a childs balloon knocked out power to 
two of rhode islands largest hospitals for up to 40 minutes 
saturday forcing surgeons to operate by flashlight and nurses to 
help intensivecare patients breathe by hand 
emergency generators that normally would kick in within one 
minute of a power failure at rhode island hospital failed to work 
for unknown reasons said hospital spokesman rick piester 
the neighboring women amp infants hospital which is on rhode 
island hospitals electrical system also was without power for 
several minutes until its own generator started said spokesman 
robert ball 
it was a period of no little panic ball said weve never 
lost power before 
a balloon with an aluminum foil streamer got loose from a 
waterfront festival being held on narragansett electric co property 
and drifted upward into a transformer that serves the two hospitals 
causing a short circuit but no permanent damage said charles f 
moran a utility spokesman 
although the festivals organizers had been coached about safety 
we never anticipated anybody would bring in balloons with aluminum 
trailers on them moran said all such balloons which were being 
given away by a restaurant running a food booth were hunted down 
and destroyed after the power failure he said 
two patients were in operating rooms at rhode island hospital 
when the power went off surgery on one had not yet begun and the 
other patient who was on local anesthesia remained awake while his 
operation was finished by flashlight piester said 
at women amp infants a surgeon completed a caesarean section by 
flashlight and mother and child were doing fine ball said 
about 40 intensivecare patients on respirators were respirated 
by hand with nurses using bags to force air into their lungs 
piester said some emergency room patients were taken to a lobby so 
their condition could be monitored in sunlight he said 
nurses also helped premature infants breathe by hand at women amp 
infants said ball women amp infants which specializes in obstetrics 
and gynecological procedures had 110 adults and about 170 infants 
saturday the number of premature infants on respirators was not 
immediately available 
one emergency room patient at rhode island hospital was 
transferred elsewhere ambulances were warned away by radio and the 
hospital was preparing to transfer some of its other 575 inpatients 
when the power came back on piester said 
narragansett electric said power was restored 25 minutes after it 
went off but piester said it was 40 minutes before rhode island 
hospitals power was fully restored 
deputy fire chief frederick miller said all five of the citys 
ambulances stood by to transfer patients and nearby cities were 
warned to expect calls for help 
miller said the fire department had never practiced coping with a 
hospital blackout and ball said there had never been any drills at 
the hospital to practice for total power outages 
what happened today is the thing that would never happen 
ball said

six months ago mayor edward i koch was an 
anyonecanbeathim underdog now hes a comebackoftheyear 
contender in his quest for an unprecedented fourth term 
polls have the threeterm incumbent running nearly even with his 
prime opponent manhattan borough president david dinkins in 
tuesdays democratic primary strategists on both sides said their 
ability to turn out voters would decide the election 
i think its going to be very very close said david garth 
kochs political and media adviser asked his plans for lastminute 
appeals he joked were going to ask the people to join us in 
prayer 
its neck and neck i dont think you can ever count out an 
incumbent who has been in office as long as ed koch said bill 
lynch dinkins campaign manager he claimed a slight lead 
confirmed by most polls 
the latest survey conducted wednesday and thursday by wabctv 
and the daily news found 49 percent support for dinkins and 42 
percent for koch but the margin of error for that poll was six 
points and previous polls showed the race within the margin of 
error 
koch reacting to the latest poll results declared a big 
turnout i win but he also expressed more anxiety about this race 
than any other in his career 
meanwhile he presides over a troubled city 
when koch was elected to his third term in 1985 only a handful 
of investigators were aware of city corruption scandals about to 
break open crack was virtually unknown the full devastation of the 
aids epidemic was not yet generally apparent there were fewer 
homeless people crime rates had not hit the historic levels theyre 
at now 
the democratic primary is about all those issues said rep 
thomas manton democratic leader of the borough of queens and a new 
koch supporter but more than anything its a question of the 
incumbent and his record 
whatever the primarys outcome it will make history dinkins 
would be the first black man nominated by a major party for mayor in 
new york koch would be the first mayor nominated for a fourth term 
the democratic nomination usually means election because there 
are five democrats here for each republican but rudolph w 
giuliani a popular former federal prosecutor is front runner for 
the gop nomination and could mount a creditable challenge in the 
nov 7 general election 
attention for the moment was riveted on the democratic race a 
contest of style as much as substance between the reserved 
unflappable dinkins and the outspoken occasionally outrageous koch 
but while he trailed badly in early polls koch appears to have 
regained many of the voters who had left him for the nowfaltering 
candidacy of city comptroller harrison j goldin goldin and a 
fourth candidate former transit chief richard ravitch trail the 
leaders badly as does giulianis only challenger in the republican 
primary cosmetics company heir ronald lauder 
kochs campaign has been focused on his record his tv ads are 
about what ed koch has done said lee miringoff pollster at the 
marist college institute for public opinion the net effect of 
that seems to be to have driven down his negative rating somewhat 
dinkins got help last weekend from jesse jackson who got 45 
percent of the new york city vote in last years democratic 
presidential primary jackson came back to energize our support 
said lynch but he has not played a major role because of his 
negative appraisal by many jews another important voting group 
jews may make up 25 percent of the democratic vote blacks up to 
a third koch himself is jewish 
the greatest energizer of the black vote may prove to be the aug 
23 killing of a black youth yusuf hawkins by a white gang in 
bensonhurst koch drew sharp criticism by suggesting protest marches 
after the killing had exacerbated racial tensions 
its my feeling the bensonhurst thing has hurt us garth 
said by motivating blacks in brooklyn to vote bensonhurst has 
upstaged for at least the last two weeks every other issue 
even before the killing dinkins stressed harmony and 
conciliation as his campaign themes and since then he has 
maintained a soothing response however some analysts have 
suggested that the protests by militant black activists may give 
koch a white backlash vote 
said lynch i can make an argument for it hurting or helping 
certain help for dinkins will come from a major getoutthevote 
effort on his behalf by most of the citys largest unions including 
teachers municipal employees and teamsters 
about 5000 union volunteers will make telephone calls hand out 
literature and carry signboards urging votes for dinkins on primary 
day said brian mclaughlin of the central labor council of the 
aflcio he called the coordinated effort unprecedented 
koch with less union support and fewer volunteers of his own is 
unlikely to approach dinkins strength on the streets kochs aides 
express concern on this point and dinkins campaign manager called 
it crucial 
in a race thats neck and neck lynch said turnout is 
going to be the issue

czechoslovakias most prominent human 
rights activist has appealed to polish prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki and leading hungarian reformer imre pozsgay to help free 
two slovak activists 
in an open letter vaclav havel told mazowiecki and pozsgay that 
they might well be in jail rather than in leading positions if they 
lived in todays czechoslovakia he begged them to speak out for jan 
carnogursky and miroslav kusy 
the two were arrested last month and could face up to 10 years in 
jail if convicted on subversion charges they were arrested for 
signing a document calling for a silent protest on the anniversary 
of the 1968 sovietled invasion that crushed reforms in prague 
i cannot imagine that the efforts of your countries to create a 
democratic and pluralistic society could be permanently successful 
if czechoslovakia were to remain stuck between poland and hungary 
like a dark wedge a country which imprisons probably more 
critics of its leadership than in late soviet president leonid i 
brezhnevs time he wrote 
havels letter was written friday and made available by the 
londonbased emigre publishing house palach press 
havel who was jailed for four months earlier this year compared 
kusy a former senior communist party official to pozsgay he 
likened carnogursky a leading roman catholic lay activist to 
polands new noncommunist premier 
to mazowiecki the playwright noted that if the situation in 
czechoslovakia developed toward democracy it cannot be ruled out 
that one day jan carnogursky might be holding the same post with 
which you have been entrusted in poland 
both carnogursky and kusy repeatedly have been harassed and 
detained for their role as charter 77 human rights activists 
hungary and poland have embraced democratic reform while 
czechoslovakia has resisted change

three days of talks between ethiopia and eritrean 
rebels have convinced each side that the other sincerely wants to 
end their 28year war former president jimmy carter said saturday 
i dont really see a major obstacle now carter a neutral 
observer in the talks between ethiopias marxist government and the 
eritrean peoples liberation front told reporters 
carter said negotiators had agreed on 13 items during discussions 
aimed at setting an agenda for future more substantiative peace 
talks he would not elaborate but said a statement with more details 
would be issued after the talks end probably sunday or monday 
carter also announced he plans to travel to nicaragua later this 
month and again around years end to examine preparations for that 
countrys national elections he went to panama earlier this year to 
observe the national voting there and accused the noriega 
government of stealing the election 
since 1961 the ethiopian government and rebels have been 
fighting over the independence of the province of eritrea a former 
italian colony that has ethiopias only direct access to the red 
sea an estimated 1 million people have died in the war and related 
famine 
i think each side when i began talking to them was totally 
convinced that all the other side wanted to do was have a propaganda 
victory of some kind carter said 
and now after these hours of communicating with each other 
making concessions to each agreement i dont think theres any 
doubt that they both know that the other side really is sincere in 
trying to make progress toward peace he said 
he said the leaders of the delegations here frequently have 
called ethiopian leader mengistu haile mariam and the liberation 
fronts general secretary isaias afwerki for guidance the 
delegation representatives were not on hand with carter at 
saturdays briefing but carter said they would participate in a 
news conference at the conclusion of the talks 
carter who is participating in the talks as a private citizen 
said he has notified the state department of the progress of the 
discussions he said he also has been in contact with the soviet 
union which supports the ethiopian government he would not comment 
on the us or soviet response 
the talks are being held at the carter center opened in 1986 
the center houses the presidential libaray a museum a think tank 
and organizations dedicated to peace public health and other issues 
carter who as president a decade ago helped egypt and israel 
negotiate the historic camp david accords said his role in the 
ethiopia talks has occasionally been frustrating 
the thing thats frustrating to me as a mediator is the 
timeconsuming exchange of ideas the repetition and so forth he 
said what i do is i listen to each side let them debate one 
another maybe recess for a few minutes i go up to my word 
processor and type out what i think is an acceptable compromise i 
come back and present this to the chairman and the whole group and 
let them hopefully discuss my papers instead of their previous 
original proposals

roman catholic primate jozef glemp who has 
been at the center of a dispute over a convent at the auschwitz 
death camp has canceled a planned trip to the united states the 
state news agency reported saturday 
the pap agency said the leader of polands catholic church is 
postponing his visit because of circumstances not favorable for 
the trip it did not refer to the controversy over the convent 
the primate has been at the center of the dispute over the 
presence of carmelite nuns at the site of the nazi death camp the 
convent is in a former warehouse just outside the camp site 
glemp was to visit chicago cleveland milwaukee detroit 
washington and boston beginning sept 21 
the polish church did not meet a feb 22 deadline to move the 
convent to an interfaith center as agreed under a 1987 accord 
reached by catholic and jewish leaders 
many jews and others view the nuns presence as an offensive 
intrusion of christian symbols at a place where 25 million jews 
were murdered by the nazis during world war ii 
glemps efforts to calm the dispute which has brought protesters 
to the convent backfired when he said the pact should be 
renegotiated he also said in an aug 26 sermon that polish 
antisemitism would disappear if jews would abandon antipolish 
sentiments 
glemp also angered many by suggesting jews helped spread 
communism and by mentioning that some collaborated with nazis 
during world war ii 
the primate and a polish church commission have urged more talks 
without preconditions to resolve the future of the convent 
efforts to move the convent have found little sympathy among many 
poles who say 15 million christians also were killed at the site 
in chicago leaders of the polish and jewish communities praised 
glemps decision to call off the trip jewish leaders said remarks 
made by glemp about the convent had strained relations to the 
breaking point 
michael kotzin director of the jewish community relations 
council said in a telephone interview now we in this community 
have the opportunity for quiet attempts to deal with tensions in 
polishjewish and catholicjewish relations 
chicago alderman roman pucinski head of the illinois division of 
the polishamerican congress also praised glemp for his decision 
in view of the worldwide controversy that the auschwitz camp 
has developed into im sure that the cardinal is doing a very wise 
thing pucinski said in a telephone interview its an explosive 
situation

india has agreed to withdraw its 
peacekeeping troops from sri lanka by end of the year a senior 
government official said saturday 
sri lankan officials have been trying for months to obtain the 
withdrawal of the troops who were sent to this island nation two 
years ago to quell ethnic violence 
an agreement on the new withdrawal date dec 31 was reached by 
indian and sri lankan officials during a meeting of nonaligned 
nations in belgrade yugoslavia the official said he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi said friday in new delhi that 
an agreement had been reached on the pullout of the estimated 42000 
indian soldiers from sri lankas northeast but he refused to give 
details 
gandhi held at least two meetings in belgrade with sri lankan 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne the sri lankan official said 
wijeratne apprised president ranasinghe premadasa of the indian 
proposals 
india had earlier proposed a withdrawal by the end of february 
sri lanka rejected the date triggering a dilplomatic deadlock 
the official said premadasa will consult his ministers on the new 
proposal on wednesday the government was very likely to approve 
the december withdrawal the official said 
india sent its troops under a peace accord it had sponsored to 
end a tamil insurrection for an independent nation in sri lankas 
northeast the accord signed on july 29 1987 offered tamils 
limited autonomy if rebel groups surrendered their weapons 
while most militias abided by the accord the dominant rebel 
group reneged on the pact and began attacking indian troops india 
despatched more soldiers to put down attacks by the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam but the fighting continued and at least 1000 
indian soldiers have been killed 
in june premadasa asked india to withdraw all its troops by july 
29 gandhi refused saying a hasty pullout would lead to even more 
bloodshed 
a military showdown between the two countries however was 
averted when india agreed to make a token pullout on july 29 and 
subsequent limited withdrawals but the two countries failed to 
agree on a timetable for the complete withdrawal 
premadasa asked for the withdrawal to appease sinhalese radicals 
in the south who had launched a campaign of assassinations and 
terror to protest the accord and the presence of indian troops the 
militants say the indians compromise the countrys independence and 
they say the accord made too many concessions to the tamils 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people they 
claim they are denied jobs and education by the sinhalese who make 
up 75 percent of the population and control the government and 
military 
india got involved because of the sympathies of its own 60 
million tamils for the rebel cause 
at least 10000 people have died in the 6yearold tamil war 
officials say at least 5000 have died in the 2yearold uprising by 
the sinhalese militants 
in a bid to end the violence premadasa has called a meeting of 
all political parties on wednesday and also invited militant 
leaders they have not said if they will come however 
on friday security forces killed eight sinhalese radicals across 
the sinhalese heartland the government said 
elsewhere a sinhalese police constable and a woman were shot to 
death by the extremists in southern sri lanka and more than 235 
suspected radicals were arrested the government said

boris n yeltsin the gadfly in mikhail 
gorbachevs ointment arrived saturday for his first visit to the 
united states a twoweek national tour featuring the soviet 
political mavericks views on glasnost and government 
i want to see the washington monument library of congress and 
other cultural treasures of the united states yeltsin said at an 
impromptu news conference at kennedy international airport 
i also want to meet with you im meeting with businessmen 
politicians and universities yeltsin said through a translator 
its a good opportunity to visit your country 
yeltsin wearing a blue suit with a soviet flag on the lapel was 
presented with a bouquet of roses upon his arrival by 
representatives of the esalen institute which invited him as part 
of its sovietamerican exchange program 
as he moved through the airport yeltsin got a taste of western 
life a greeting from a hare krishna follower who gave him two 
books and two roses 
its kind of a little thanks for the changes in the soviet 
union said david jakupko director of soviet affairs for the hare 
krishnas worldwide 
the visit brings gorbachevs most vocal critic to the us and 
caps yeltsins comeback from political outcast to populist hero 
hes in a class by himself he has an enormous vitality hes 
an iconoclast hes become a symbol of resentment against party 
bureaucrats said marshall shulman an adviser to carter 
administration secretary of state cyrus vance and a soviet expert 
on monday he is to deliver a luncheon address to the council on 
foreign relations followed by an evening speech at columbia 
university 
we expect boris will be on good evening america or good 
morning america whatever it is said yeltsins chief aide lev 
sukhanov 
two years ago yeltsin was booted from his post as moscows 
communist party chief after he criticized the slow pace of reform 
under gorbachev 
but yeltsin thrived after his dismissal he campaigned for a seat 
in the soviet congress and in march was swept into office with more 
than 90 percent of the popular vote in the first contested soviet 
election since 1917 he now heads the soviet unions radical bloc of 
legislators 
yeltsin 58 through an intermediary sent word earlier this year 
to the leigh bureau in princeton nj that he was interested in 
coming to the united states said bill leigh head of the speakers 
agency 
an invitation was extended via esalen and the final details 
worked out the first week in august leigh said yeltsins visit may 
also have a capitalist purpose yeltsin has a book deal with a us 
publisher shulman said although yeltsin plans to donate his 
speaking fees to a soviet fund to fight aids and said he hoped to 
visit aids clinics 
yeltsin is scheduled to leave sept 23 in the meantime hell 
stay busy 
appearances have already been announced in new york 
philadelphia chicago indianapolis minneapolis baltimore dallas 
miami and washington although leigh said his exact schedule was not 
set 
its not clear if yeltsin plans to criticize gorbachev during his 
visit leigh would only say his columbia speech concerned the 
future of soviet democracy 
shulman believes yeltsin will tread lightly when it comes to 
criticizing the soviet leader while in this country 
he is conscious of the fact that gorbachev is in a difficult 
position he supports gorbachev but he would like gorbachev to move 
along more quickly with reform shulman said 
my guess is he will be constrained in his criticism but its 
hard to predict hes a mercurial man

gov steve cowper got his first word about 
the nations worst oil spill while he was telling an interviewer 
that he had decided not to run for reelection 
since then hes had little time to think about life beyond the 
governors mansion 
cowper announced his decision march 24 coincidentally the same 
day the tanker exxon valdez ripped its hull open on a reef and 
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil into 
prince william sound 
the disaster has defined his political life ever since 
in recent weeks cowper has been lobbying congress and seeking 
support from other governors for federal laws to improve the 
nations response to major oil spills 
the major thing that weve learned as a result of the spill is 
that this nation doesnt have the capability of cleaning up an oil 
spill as big as this one he said 
cowper would like to see the coast guard put in absolute charge 
of any oil spill larger than 12000 barrels a national inventory of 
spill equipment including some sovietclass oilskimming vessels 
and a trained corps of spill experts who can respond quickly 
speed is of the essence when youre responding to an oil spill 
and youre standing around trying to figure out where the equipment 
is he said an oil spill can get out of hand pretty quickly 
thats what happened in prince william sound 
the spill gave cowper the kind of national exposure coveted by 
any ambitious politician and his frequent appearances on national 
tv led to rumors that he was training his sites on a seat in 
congress he has not ruled that out but in a recent interview he 
said he will take a long leave from politics when his fouryear term 
expires next year 
i may come back for another try for elective office but if i 
do i expect it will be years from now said cowper who was due 
back in the state during the weekend after a 10day good will trip 
to siberia 
if i had to make the decision right now id say id never be 
interested in going to washington he said my impression is 
that people dont enjoy those jobs anymore they have to spend half 
their time in useless activity and a lot of whats left over is 
directed toward raising money 
cowper 50 moved to alaska in 1968 but still speaks with the 
distinctive drawl of his native virginia he worked as an attorney 
prosecutor businessman newspaper reporter research diver 
arbitrator state lobbyist and served two terms in the alaska house 
in the late 1970s he was elected governor in 1986 after defeating 
incumbent gov william sheffield in the democratic primary 
despite his varied career many were surprised by his decision to 
look for a new job in 1990 
actually i have never even remotely considered running for a 
second term he said i always did think that i was going to 
serve for four years and step down i was persuaded not to mention 
it not till march 
at times the stress of being governor of this vast oildependent 
state has been evident on cowper who concedes i dont have much 
of a poker face 
if ive looked anxious from time to time its because alaskas 
gone through some very hard experiences while ive been in office 
the economy had crashed the government appeared to be in 
crisis the budget was in severe imbalance we had an assortment of 
emergencies including the oil spill i had an organization in the 
senate for the first two years that was actively hostile to almost 
everything that we wanted to do

aviation specialists said saturday 
that metal fatigue might have caused the crash of a norwegian 
charter plane that plunged into the north sea killing all 55 people 
aboard 
the twinengine cv580 convair turboprop was flying from norway 
to west germany when it vanished from radar screens friday and 
crashed 185 miles north of the danish fishing port of hirtshals 
whatever occurred happened so quickly the pilots had no time to send 
a distress signal according to investigators 
tommy jensen head of the danish crash investigation team was 
quoted by the norwegian ntb news agency as saying so far no burns 
or other damage on bodies or wreckage has been found to indicate an 
explosives blast bodies and wreckage were found within a 
concentrated area whereas midair explosions usually scatter them 
some victims were found still strapped in their seats that had 
torn loose from the fuselage he said 
in norway political parties canceled the rest of the campaign 
for national elections in mourning for the crash victims but the 
balloting will be held monday as scheduled 
rolf grimsrud of norways civil aviation board said parts of the 
plane might have been ripped apart when cabin pressure dropped as 
the craft arrived at its cruising altitude of about 23000 feet the 
cause could have been metal fatigue in some section he said 
indicating a bomb explosion was seen as unlikely though not ruled 
out 
all 50 passengers were employees of the wilhelmsen lines shipping 
company of oslo they had been chosen by lottery for the free trip 
to hamburg west germany to see a ship christened the plane had a 
crew of five 
officials initially said all of the victims were norwegians but 
a company list which reported there were 38 men and 17 women 
aboard said three of the women had british passports and were 
living in norway 
rescue officials reported late saturday that 31 bodies had been 
recovered and it was presumed the others were trapped in the 
wreckage they had reported friday that 32 bodies had been found but 
lowered that figures as the remains were brought ashore 
the usbuilt plane belonged to the norwegian partnair charter 
airline company the 35year old aircraft had recently undergone a 
major maintenance checkup in canada the airline said 
flight supervisor karl andersen at copenhagens kastrup airport 
was quoted by danish radio as saying parts of the plane might have 
broken off in flight the radar signal disappeared very suddenly 
from our screens and the plane went down fast he said 
no other flights or flying objects were spotted on flight control 
radar screens at the time discounting the possibility of a 
collision or the craft had been shot down andersen added 
officials said a fishing trawler participating in the search 
received a sonar echo that could have been from the wreckage but 
west german navy divers could not confirm that because of poor 
visibility at the 90yard depth 
a norwegian vessel with minisubmarines was on its way to the area 
to help locate the wreckage including the flight recorders 
according to officials 
they said the effort to recover all of the bodies and complete 
the salvage operation could take up to two weeks

president mikhail s gorbachev resuming command 
after his summer vacation on saturday dismissed warnings of 
impending chaos and assured soviets his reforms are on track 
looking rested and slightly tanned gorbachev covered a wide 
range of national issues in a halfhour speech on the nightly 
television news program vremya including strikes crime shortages 
and the need for the consolidation of all progressive forces to 
further his reforms 
he skirted the ethnic conflicts that are plaguing the soviet 
union and did not mention the recent central committee attack on 
separatists in the baltic republics or the weeklong strike in the 
southern republic of azerbaijan 
intimidation about impending chaos and speculation about the 
threat of a coup even a civil war can be heard gorbachev said 
its a fact that someone wants to create in society an atmosphere 
of anxiety hopelessness and insecurity 
but gorbachev assured viewers we are building up and 
deepening the changes that we started and they will bring results 
gorbachev last was seen in public in early august and he was 
presumed to be on vacation until this week but an official soviet 
spokesman said the president was involved in a stinging central 
committee statement on the baltic republics two weeks ago warning 
baltic residents about nationalists who were going too far and 
leading them into an abyss 
gorbachev also reportedly consulted by telephone at the time with 
lithuanian party chief algirdas brazauskas 
on the explosive ethnic conflicts gorbachev said only that they 
would be discussed at a plenum of the policysetting central 
committee the plenum is expected this week or next week at the 
latest and tass reported saturday night that the ruling politburo 
met friday and discussed ethnic issues to prepare for it 
gorbachev warned saturday that strikes can have dangerous 
consequences for society and we should not tolerate the huge 
economic losses they create 
hundreds of thousands of soviet coal miners went on strike in 
july to demand better conditions and many workers in the southern 
republic of azerbaijan were on strike all this week to press for 
control of the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh 
on crime gorbachev called for the strictest order in cities 
and towns and he praised informal crimefighting groups 
he said the government has to answer for shortages that steadily 
have worsened in the last year including such staples as sugar 
tea butter and meat 
gorbachev warned that some measures taken to fix the economy 
might be unpopular tough in some ways and painful to a certain 
extent 
he defended the communist party which has been under fire for 
reacting too slowly to changes in soviet society he said the party 
was overcoming its dogmatism and conservatism 
those who hope to take advantage of difficulties of the period 
of transition for some unsavory purposes and try to undermine the 
partys influence should know that this will not work he said 
as he often has before gorbachev called for a middle road 
between radicals who want to effect changes too fast and 
conservatives who hope for a return to the past

about 50 aids activists disrupted opening 
night of the san francisco opera chanting you have the power to 
stop aids now but an opera spokesman said the protest was 
misdirected 
the audience that these people irritated are the people who are 
paying for aids benefits in san francisco it was the wrong audience 
to do this in front of tom illgen the operas marketing 
director said after friday nights demonstration 
the protesters were members of the group stop aids now or else 
also known as sane members of the same group blocked off the golden 
gate bridge during rush hour for about 45 minutes on jan 31 before 
being arrested police made no arrests friday night 
shortly after the conductor took his place and the orchestra 
prepared to strike the opening chords of falstaff the 
protesters stormed through the aisles 
we are demanding that those in attendance tonight wield their 
power to make ending the aids epidemic a national priority a 
group statement said 
as the activists chanted threw leaflets and displayed banners 
the orchestra played the national anthem and members of the 
audience stood and sang along illgen said 
i dont think the message that was meant to get across got 
across he said 
opera staffers carried and shoved the protesters out of the 
auditorium illgen said 
he said the 30minute protest upset the opera audience which 
included singer linda ronstadt and actor raoul julia but it was 
not a big problem because opening night goes up about 20 minutes 
late anyway

housing secretary jack kemp said he does not 
want to see security fences put up around public housing projects as 
called for in president bushs antidrug strategy saying its more 
important to make the projects better places to live 
kemp called a proposal in bushs national drug control strategy 
put security fences around the housing projects at the margin a 
possibility but its not my idea 
i dont want to put up some type of fence around public 
housing the secretary of housing and urban development said in 
the interview broadcast on cnns newsmaker saturday program 
the strategy includes a plan to make the nations public 
housing projects safer and freer from drug activity 
the outline suggests steps including new regulations kemp has 
already supported to speed the eviction of public housing residents 
who are found to be drug dealers it continues security 
improvements such as better lighting guards identification cards 
security fences will be added to protect law abiding citizens from 
the threat posed by drug dealers 
asked on the broadcast about the fences kemp said not in 
every instance and very frankly that is at the margin a 
possibility but its not my idea 
and i think bill bennett as well as the president would if 
they had been where ive been and ive been in many public housing 
communities in the last six months what we mean by security is 
not dogs and machine guns and fences he said 
what we mean by security is welllit residences public housing 
authority figures on the premises or maybe police on the corner it 
means getting the drug dealer out and it means making sure that 
these units are not being used for crack dealers said kemp 
he added i think the presidents program is justified in terms 
of putting out some of the brush fires that already exist in public 
housing

a quadriplegic who won court permission to 
turn off his own life support system said saturday he knows that 
whatever happens after he does so will be better than life without a 
body 
try to imagine being frozen not being able to move anything 
not even being able to breathe said larry mcafee an engineer and 
avid outdoorsman before a 1985 motorcycle wreck severed his spine 
paralyzing him from the chin down 
the 33yearold atlanta resident received permission wednesday 
from a georgia judge to return to that state and turn off the 
ventilator that has breathed for him and kept him alive since the 
accident 
mcafee said he was not frightened but wonders what will happen 
when he dies 
i believe in god i pray a lot i believe that whatever happens 
after death will be better he said 
mcafee met with reporters for about 30 minutes at a nursing home 
where he has been for the past month he sat strapped into a 
wheelchair with breathing tubes in his throat and mouth his words 
interrupted by loud gasps for air 
he would not say when he plans to turn off his lifesupport 
machine 
mcafee said that in some small way he hoped publicity over 
his decision would help others in similar conditions 
i wasnt aware of the problems involved in trying to obtain a 
court order like this the problems and the time it took for me 
he said 
mcafee said he did not consider the decision to end his life to 
be suicide to me suicide is an unnatural act turning off a 
ventilator and letting nature take its course to me that is not 
unnatural he said 
mcafee said his family supported his decision but none of his 
relatives attended the news conference julie orr one of his 
sisters said he had not discussed his plans with family members 
mcafee said he has spent the last four years watching a clock 
watching tv and doing a small amount of reading 
he said that although the high cost of his care was a factor in 
his decision the main reason was the indignity of having to depend 
on others for everything 
year after year day after day it just slowly drains 
everything you have he said 
georgia superior court judge edward johnson ruled last week that 
mcafees right to refuse continued lifesustaining treatment 
outweighed the states interest in preserving his life 
the ventilator to which he is attached is not prolonging his 
life johnson said his order it is prolonging his death 
johnson ordered the state to appeal the decision to the georgia 
supreme court but said mcafee would not have to await the outcome 
mcafee met privately saturday with his attorney randall h davis 
of atlanta who said mcafee plans to go to a friends apartment in 
atlanta he said mcafee wants to activate a timer that will shut off 
his ventilator 
the two men told reporters that offers of hightech machines that 
would help mcafee perform routine household tasks were generous but 
could not provide a life that he wanted to live 
davis said mcafee has been in counseling for four years and has 
had ample opportunity to discuss innovative technologies that would 
allow him to perform some functions hes heard it all davis 
said

montanas old west centennial spectacular 
of longhorn cattle cowboys and covered wagons rumbled into town 
just after dawn saturday drawing an uproarious welcome along a 
threemile parade route 
thousands began lining the main street route through billings 
heights in spite of a predawn temperature of 47 degrees to cheer on 
the cattle drive and wagon train that revived for six short days 
the romanticism heroism and friendship of a bygone era some people 
had begun reserving viewing spots with parked cars the day before 
the cattle and drovers had been accompanied on the trail by some 
240 covered wagons and 2400 social riders 
this is the best western movie ive ever seen said ingemar 
gleissman of stockholm sweden gleissman said he decided he had to 
join the cattle drive after reading about it during a business trip 
to san francisco 
to take part in the drive riders had to have an animal for the 
cattle herd if they didnt own one they could lease one 
all our friends loved the fact that were renting a cow said 
sally branning of cherry hills nj they all asked how ill tell 
it apart from the other cows 
after the parade the cattle were driven to two billings 
livestock markets where most cattle arrive by truck and the riders 
dismounted for an auction of memorabilia and a concert 
the sixday celebration was the most ambitious of scores of 
official events created to celebrate montanas 100th year as a state 
the parade opened with one rider bellowing a long yeeeeehaw 
as a procession headed by a union cavalry unit rolled into town 
the riders and covered wagons accompanying the drive arrived 
first followed by the 2700 head of cattle that had been driven 60 
miles the old fashioned way since leaving the small town of roundup 
on monday roundup was chosen as the starting point partly because 
of its name 
although the riders and wagons were confined to onehalf of the 
street the cattle swept along all six lanes of the boulevard when 
they hit the parade route 
nobody explained to the cows that theyre only supposed to use 
half the street a police officer said 
the rangy longhorns that made up most of the herd trailwise and 
a little tired after six days caused little trouble on city streets 
and delighted the exuberant crowd in the city of about 65000 people 
although they were nearly surrounded by the 105 drovers who had 
herded them over the route the animals still passed within easy 
petting distance of the crowd and a few people reached out to touch 
them as they moved by 
riders and horses strutted and pranced in response to the crowds 
admiration but the cattle were largely indifferent they plodded 
sedately and unknowingly past mcdonalds arbys and other 
symbols of their fate 
billings police augmented by sheriffs and highway patrol 
officers turned out fullforce to control and protect the crowds 
a full force of street cleaners both people and machines swung 
into action immediately after the cattle and horses were gone 
a hint of saturdays turnout came thursday when an estimated 
20000 people drove 21 miles north of town for a public concert at 
the wagon camp traffic was snarled for hours and police had to 
turn back about 5000 people

the bush administration is shunning covert 
intervention in nicaragua and instead is looking for money from 
congress to openly support the sandinista governments political 
opposition sources said saturday 
secretary of state james a baker iii is expected to speak with 
congressional leaders this week on prospects for a grant to the 
national endowment for democracy which would help the opposition 
campaign in the february elections said the sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the administration is considering asking for around 3 million to 
help violeta chamorro the prominent newspaper publisher chosen by 
several opposition parties as a consensus presidential candidate 
plus an unspecified amount for such things as voter registration 
election observers and repatriation said the sources 
carl gershman president of the national endowment said he did 
not know if congress or the administration was using the 3 million 
figure but my understanding is that it is roughly in the range of 
what some of the nicaraguans thought they need 
gershman said he has discussed new funding with members of 
congress and the ned board of directors which would approve how the 
money is spent will take it up at the end of the week 
the endowment is a private foundation created by congress in 1982 
to support democratic elections worldwide with money appropriated 
by congress for 1989 it got 158 million for its 
democracypromoting activities such as holding conferences and 
observing elections 
the organization since 1985 has provided support for la prensa 
the opposition newspaper led by mrs chamorro 
earlier this year congress approved 15 million for the 
endowment to promote democratic activity in nicaragua along with 
the same amount to pay for election observers under the auspices of 
the organization of american states 
we dont want to go the covert route said one administration 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity the official added 
the administration believes there would be no support in congress 
for covert action of the sort the cia used for years in nicaragua 
white house spokeman roman popadiuk declined to comment 
specifically on the administration plans 
the united states has long supported a return to democracy in 
nicaragua he said the national endowment for democracy has 
played a role in this process the administration is continuting to 
examine ways in which it can play a role in a fair and open 
election 
nicaraguas political opposition leaders signed an agreement with 
the sandinistas this summer agreeing there would be no secret 
funding of political activity 
under nicaraguan law half of any funds coming into the electoral 
system from outside the country must be given to the national 
supreme electoral council which oversees and monitors elections 
that means giving 6 million would have to be sent to nicaragua 
to ensure mrs chamorro got 3 million and some of the money would 
benefit the sandinista ticket under the national councils 
activities 
gershman said the us funds if approved would help even out an 
incredibly unbalanced situation in nicaragua where president 
daniel ortegas sandinistas control government resources 
theyre getting massive subsidies from the soviet bloc he 
said adding any us funds would be spent by his group in the 
spirit of trying to introduce a degree of fairness in the 
situation 
he said the opposition forces also are expected to seek campaign 
funds in europe and latin america 
the washington post which initially reported on the aid proposal 
saturday said the administration had been considering using the cia 
in the election in nicaragua but anticipated heavy congressional 
opposition 
after years of pinning its policy on the contra rebels that were 
fighting to oust the sandinistas the united states under president 
bush has endorsed diplomatic efforts underway to achieve peace 
with little sentiment in congress for renewing military aid bush 
agreed with congressional leaders on a 49 million nonlethal aid 
package to keep the contras in supplies and food until the election 
and to be used for repatriation where needed 
the last us military aid to the contras came in a 100 million 
package in 1986 that was accompanied by a lifting of restrictions on 
cia covert activity in nicaragua 
the presidents of nicaragua and four other central american 
nations reached agreement this year calling for disbandment of the 
contras coupled with moves toward democratic reform in nicaragua 
leading to the february elections

two ukrainian leaders joined saturday in calling 
for the ouster of the last old guard member of the ruling politburo 
an activist said 
at a different meeting saturday another conservative politburo 
member yegor k ligachev warned that ethnic unrest could lead to 
the collapse of the soviet union 
the calls for the removal of vladimir v shcherbitsky who is 
also chief of the ukrainian communist party came at a meeting of 
the ukrainian popular movement for perestroika in the republics 
capital kiev speakers called for creation of a sovereign free 
ukraine with a multiparty system 
sergei i konev a member of the new soviet congress called on 
the grassroots group to express its lack of confidence in the 
government of the ukraine headed by shcherbitsky according to 
anatoly dotsenko moscowbased spokesman for the us human rights 
group helsinki watch 
konev said president mikhail s gorbachev should do everything 
he can as soon as possible so that the criminals of chernobyl get 
out of the ukrainian government 
shcherbitsky was in charge of the ukraine when a reactor exploded 
at the chernobyl nuclear power plant killing 31 people spewing 
radiation and forcing the evacuation of thousands some residents 
accuse him of covering up the radiation damage restraining the 
local press and arresting and harassing dissidents 
at 71 shcherbitsky is the oldest of the 12 men on the ruling 
politburo and is considered one of the most conservative except 
for gorbachev he is the only member who dates back to the late 
president leonid i brezhnev now blamed for the countrys economic 
decay 
many of the 2000 delegates and guests applauded konevs remarks 
dotsenko said quoting observers at the meeting 
ligachev spoke out for the second time in a week against ethnic 
unrest 
if there is no interethnic accord and friendship between 
people there will be no effective work in the economic sphere at 
businesses in fields and at farms and then the disintegration of 
the union of soviet republics is unavoidable ligachev said 
the communist party daily pravda reported ligachevs remarks at

hurricane gabrielle stalled in the atlantic on 
saturday annoying the northeast coast of the united states with 
heavy swells but remaining far from land 
its losing its steering currents said forecaster bob case 
of the national hurricane center it looks like its going to hang 
up and become almost stationary for the next two days 
gabrielles 85 mph winds will probably weaken because the storm 
is partly over water that is too cold to maintain its circular 
motion he said 
but it continues to create large swells along the coastline 
especially along the new england and midatlantic coast case 
added 
at 6 pm edt gabrielles center was located near 392 degrees 
north latitude and 602 degrees west longitude or about 335 miles 
south of sable island nova scotia 
it continued to slow and was moving north near 5 mph and was 
expected to drift northwards or become stationary saturday night or 
sunday forecasters said 
the former hurricane felix lost its tropical characteristics to 
the north of gabrielle on thursday forecasters said and was no 
longer being monitored 
gabrielle was the seventh named storm of the 1989 atlantic 
hurricane season it was at one time the strongest of the season 
with winds that peaked at 135 mph but never got close enough to 
land to cause serious damage 
systems become named tropical storms when their winds reach 39 
mph and are termed hurricanes at 74 mph

wilkesbarre pa ap attorneys for a seventhday adventist 
couple convicted of starving their teenage son to death say they 
will appeal the verdict on grounds the boy was expressing his 
freedom of religion 
fourteenyearold eric cottam died jan 3 after the family went 
six weeks without food despite 3775 set aside by erics father a 
former seventhday adventist church pastor as a tithe for god 
a jury on friday deliberated for less than two hours before 
finding larry cottam and his wife leona cottam guilty of 
thirddegree murder two counts each of recklessly endangering 
another person and endangering the welfare of children in the cases 
of eric and their 12yearold daughter laura who since has been 
placed in a foster home 
they were under the care control and custody of their parents 
even though they may not want to eat the parents duty 
supercedes luzerne county judge gifford s cappelini said after 
the verdict 
the family had contended that each member agreed to the fast 
because of their religious convictions but cappelini ruled the 
cottams couldnt raise the childrens religious freedom in front of 
the jury 
al flora jr an attorney for the cottams said he plans to 
appeal on the grounds the childrens constitutional rights to 
religious freedom were not considered by the jury because of 
cappelinis ruling 
some of the issues involved in this case are novel ones 
flora said in asking the judge to allow the cottams to remain free 
on bail pending appeal they are issues that have not been taken 
up by our appellate courts 
cottam 39 and mrs cottam 38 remain free on 50000 bail 
each an anonymous benefactor posted bail for them aug 23 after 
they spent 230 days in custody following their jan 5 arraignment at 
mercy hospital 
after he was arrested cottam told police he couldnt spend the 
nearly 4000 in tithe money for food because it belonged to god 
spending it would have been akin to stealing he said 
seventhday adventists generally give 10 percent of their 
earnings as a tithe but a church official testified at the trial 
tithing was not a requirement for membership in the church 
mrs cottam testified she had several dollars saved as a tithe 
but also believed spending the money for food would have been the 
same as stealing 
neither cottam or his wife commented following the verdict nor 
did they testify during the trial 
no sentencing date has been set they face a maximum 28 years in 
prison 
eric cottam died in an upstairs bedroom of the familys modest 
twostory home in nuangola just south of this northeastern 
pennsylvania city his 5foot 9inch frame weighed 69 pounds 
a day later larry cottam went to a neighbors house to call 
police to his home he his wife and daughter were hospitalized for 
malnutrition 
flora said the family went without food because they distrusted 
authorities and believed god would rescue them from their plight 
they also believed their children would be taken away from them if 
they sought help he said

the little red riding hood story read to 
generations of children is a fake distorted from original folk 
versions by male writers who made the girl into a frail victim an 
anthropologist said saturday 
male writers completely ruined the tale by bringing men into 
it said alan dundes of the university of californiaberkeley 
editor of a new book of scholarly essays on the classic folktale 
they made the girl a weak little thing who had to be rescued 
the original folktale is a female story in which the mother sends 
the daughter out and the little girl is triumphant 
dundes book includes analyses of little red riding hood by 
psychologists historians anthropologists and sociologists plus 
versions of the oral folktale collected in europe and asia 
there are enough oral versions around in different languages so 
that we know what the original must have been like dundes said in 
an interview 
the original folktales may have been considered too crude by 
charles perrault the french writer who first put the story into 
written form in 1697 and made it into a moral fable warning girls 
against listening to strangers dundes said at the end little red 
riding hood got gobbled up by the wolf 
the grimm brothers jacob and wilhelm based their popular 1812 
story on a secondhand account of perraults version and changed the 
ending this time the girl was saved by a hunter who cut open the 
wolfs stomach to allow little red riding hood and her grandmother 
to spring out alive 
once upon a time though little red riding hood was a craftier 
character who escaped the wolfs big teeth in fact said dundes 
the wolf was orginally female and the little girl didnt even have a 
red hood 
in european oral folk stories the girl unwittingly eats the 
flesh and blood of her grandmother who had been killed by the wolf 
dundes said in various asian versions she is tricked by the 
villain usually a female tiger or ogress into eating her sisters 
finger or bone 
in all the oral stories dundes said the girl triumphs over the 
villain and gets away 
perrault and the grimm brothers left out the cannibalism and made 
little red riding hood into a real wimp who stupidly tells the 
wolf where shes going on the way to her grandmother dundes said 
the feminists have attacked the wrong tale dundes said 
they are rightly concerned about the influence fairy tales have in 
society but they should be attacking the grimm or perrault or walt 
disney versions its not the tale thats at fault its the male 
versions

police have begun suspending the 
drivers licenses of people caught soliciting prostitutes 
police say the license suspension is worse than the standard 500 
fine for the crime which most offenders pay after pleading guilty 
rather than risk the public embarrassment of a trial 
the fine isnt bad but when they risk losing their driver 
license it takes on a whole new light said police sgt robb 
robertson 
police arrested 23 men for soliciting prostitutes last week and 
issued the license revocation charge 
they were not happy lt david hughes said i think it will 
have a good deterrent effect 
the law which says violators making a deal for sex from a car 
can lose their licenses for one year was dormant for years and 
reenacted this year

us military troops may be given an expanded 
role in the latin american drug war according to a secret section 
of president bushs antidrug program quoted in a published report 
a national security decision directive signed by bush would 
authorize us special forces to accompany local forces on some 
narcotics patrols the washington post reported in its sunday 
editions 
the directive would allow deployment of us military in 
secure areas of perus upper huallagua valley a cocagrowing 
jungle that us officials have acknowledged is effectively 
controlled by farleftist shining path guerrillas the unnamed 
sources told the newspaper 
officials estimate that more than half the cocaine consumed in 
the united states comes from coca grown in the upper huallagua 
a senior administration official quoted by the post said the 
directive doesnt call for any combat role for us troops or covert 
operations in peru bolivia or colombia 
but the official who was not named said as many as several 
hundred us military trainers advisers and other support 
personnel may be deployed to the three countries under the andean 
initiative announced by bush 
a national security decision directive conveys a presidential 
decision to key government officials who must implement it 
bush unveiled his antidrug strategy in a nationally televised 
address last tuesday but a portion of the program remains 
classified 
the administration has said repeatedly in recent weeks that it 
would not consider sending us combat troops to colombia unless 
that country made such a request colombian president virgilio 
barco whose government is waging a bloody war with drug 
traffickers has said he does not want us troops 
there has been no public discussion about us military troops in 
peru or bolivia 
administration and congressional sources told the post that the 
directive calls for enhanced involvement by the pentagon and us 
intelligence agencies in the drug effort and includes language that 
loosens rules for us troops in the andean region 
a rotating team of about a dozen us special forces from the 
southern command in panama has been based in bolivias chapare 
region for about two years to help train that nations 
antinarcotics police under existing rules us troops are 
restricted to their base camp and are prohibited from accompanying 
the local police on patrols 
the directive relaxes those rules permitting the us military 
to accompany troops on routine patrols the post said however 
it does not allow us military to direct raids or attacks on drug 
labs or trafficker hideouts an official told the newspaper 
in addition the post reported the directive would permit the 
deployment of the special troops in secure or safe haven 
areas of the upper huallaga valley including a newly fortified base 
at santa lucia used as the staging ground for joint raids by 
peruvian police and a small team of drug enforcement administration 
agents 
during internal debates dea and some state department officials 
argued against deploying us troops in peru saying it would give 
the guerrillas american targets the newspaper said

police used tear gas to turn 
back demonstrators who burned temporary housing and overturned cars 
saturday in a protest of the hiring of nonunion construction labor 
at a boise cascade paper mill 
gov rudy perpich put the national guard on alert for possible 
duty in the usually peaceful town on the canadian border but the 
crowd estimated at 400 in the morning dwindled by afternoon and 
city officials said the violence had ended 
police chief tom hardy said officers used tear gas to turn back 
the crowd and witnesses said protesters threw rocks at security 
guards a police dispatcher said several vehicles were overturned at 
the housing camp about a mile from the construction site 
five people were treated at memorial hospital for various 
injuries and released said hospital administrator randy olson 
koochiching county sheriff bill elliott said 32 people were arrested 
on charges of criminal damage to property and contempt of court 
the violence stemmed from boises hiring of a nonunion general 
contractor for a 535 million expansion project at the paper mill a 
move that sparked a wildcat strike by union members in july since 
then the company has been hit by sporadic violence including an 
arson fire that caused an estimated 250000 damage 
police expected to make more arrests after reviewing videotapes 
of the violence elliott said 
mayor jack murray in a statement read to local radio stations 
saturday morning urged the towns 6500 residents to stay in their 
homes and asked bars and liquor stores not to serve liquor that day 
you dont have a lot of control in this situation elliott 
said the people involved in it showed no respect for the law or 
for international falls 
about 45 officers from several jurisdictions were on hand he 
said but we could have had all the police manpower in northern 
minnesota and still it wouldnt have been enough 
union officials say they have tried to dissuade protesters from 
violence or mass demonstrations in international falls there was no 
immediate comment saturday from brad skarich president of the iron 
range building trades council and bill peterson head of the 
minnesota building trades council skarich did not return a message 
left on his home answering machine and there was no answer at 
petersons office 
protesters pushed through a gate at a temporary housing complex 
being set up for construction workers and tore down part of the 
fence surrounding the camp 
boise cascade spokesman bob anderson said eight to 10 mobile 
homes in the camp were destroyed including some that were totally 
burned to the ground he estimated that the facility intended to 
eventually house about 1000 people and include a cafeteria was 60 
percent destroyed 
the 100 workers already living there were removed friday night in 
anticipation of trouble anderson said boise also canceled work 
saturday at the project he said 
police as a precaution saturday morning evacuated an apartment 
building leased largely to workers hired by beampk the construction 
projects general contractor said police capt randy borden he 
could not say how many people were evacuated 
the building trade activists from the area have just gone 
berserk said anderson 
it was nonunion and racially motivated anderson said 
people destroyed property and went after lives weve had many 
people threatened its been building trades activists that are just 
acting as terrorists 
anderson said a black family was threatened saturday and the 
company moved them inside the plant for protection police were 
previously called to a mexicanamerican familys home after an arson 
threat he said 
he said there had been complaints that the company was only 
hiring blacks and hispanics 
borden said three black people were the targets of a lot of 
namecalling and yelling when the apartment building was 
evacuated he said racial elements certainly come forth when 
theres a confrontation but how much that motivates it im not in 
any position to evaluate 
elliott dismissed allegations that the riots had any racial 
overtones someone might have made a remark about blacks he 
said but added that racism wasnt linked to the rioting 
by 6 pm state officials sent to international falls told 
perpich that the situation was under control and that it is not 
necessary to move additional resources into the area at the present 
time according to a statement from the governors office guard 
members will remain on standby the statement said 
anderson complained that the governor was playing politics 
and siding with labor by not immediately sending national guardsmen 
only putting them on alert although the situation had calmed by 
afternoon anderson said protesters were drinking and he thought 
more violence could erupt 
anderson said saturdays protesters had come from north dakota 
wisconsin and michigan

thousands of oilspattered workers 
hampered by worsening weather have only a few more days to clean 
crude oil off alaskas petroleumfouled shoreline before exxon corp 
stops work for the season 
exxon says it will pull out the last of its workers by this 
coming friday after treating more than 1000 miles of shoreline 
tainted by the nations worst oil spill the company claimed 
thursday that only four miles remained to be treated but state and 
federal agencies disagree with exxon about how much has been cleaned 
and how well 
our position is that the weather is going to make us go 
regardless of what the numbers are regardless of how much is 
left said exxon spokesman henry beathard 
exxon said it chose sept 15 for the withdrawal of the last of 
its thousands of workers and hundreds of vessels to avoid 
increasingly poor weather and reduced hours of daylight in this 
land where winter comes early the first dusting of snow can already 
be seen in some higher elevations 
we have buses and planes set up for them to leave that day 
beathard said they dont have the option to take that free trip 
three days later already the first fall storm has raked prince 
william sound where the tanker exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil on march 24 gusts to 70 mph and 6to 
10foot seas shut down the point helen cleanup operation once on 
smith island a test of a solvent exxon wants to use to clean oily 
shores was delayed for at least four days by the storm 
point helen one of the last heavily hit shorelines on the 
cleanup list was left untouched until after midaugust to avoid 
disturbing a fish hatchery at sawmill bay officials said 
weather permitting the shore will be environmentally stable 
if not clean by exxons deadline the company said 
im quite confident we are going to make it if we can just 
get a few good days of weather said beachmaster warren winstead 
of baton rouge la i think if we can get another few days in 
well beat it 
but the alaska department of environmental conservation and exxon 
dispute just about everything including how many miles have been 
treated how well the job has been done and whether exxon plans to 
duck out after giving the shore a quick onceover 
the state has sued exxon and a halfdozen other oil companies 
that get oil from alaskas north slope by way of the alyeska 
pipeline claiming they were negligent in preventing and cleaning up 
the spill the exxon valdez was outbound from the pipeline terminal 
at valdez when it ripped its bottom open on a reef 
on saturday environmental and fishing groups took two dozen 
boats into port valdez for a demonstration demanding greater 
protection against oil spills 
organizers of the event held with coast guard permission said 
their main goal was to draw attention to tankers of foreign registry 
that travel in and out of the port terminus of the transalaska oil 
pipeline 
seven vessels that are registered in italy liberia and israel 
and use the port are not regulated adequately and do not carry 
sufficient liability insurance for oilspill compensation said 
nancy lethcoe vice president of the prince william sound 
conservation alliance and a partner in a local tourism business the 
coast guard said a total of 70 tankers use the port 
crews have removed gross contamination from many shorelines but 
they remain oily exxon claims about 244000 gallons of oil and 
water emulsion have been recovered 
exxon the dec and the coast guard all have different figures for 
virtually everything in part because they use different criteria 
for measuring contamination and what constitutes an effective 
cleanup the state agencys figures show exxon claiming to have 
treated more shoreline than was fouled 
were the only people honest about the numbers said joe 
bridgeman a dec spokesman the numbers are being manipulated to 
show great shoreline progress 
exxon officials acknowledged discrepancies i honestly dont 
have an adequate explantion said spokesman karsten rodvik 
as the cleanup operation grinds down from its peak of 12000 
workers and 1300 vessels valdez officials are bracing for a 
shrunken economy 
temporary housing set up by exxon will close the valdez 
population likely will plunge from 13000 to about 4500 
public agencies are getting ready to pare their staffs to winter 
levels although some work will continue scientists are studying 
the effects of fertilizer spread on test beaches to stimulate the 
growth of oileating bacteria other agencies plan to collect 
samples and study the environment during the winter 
otter and bird rescue operations are shutting down more than 
32000 birds and 980 otters died from the spills effects 
exxon has started shipping millions of pounds of equipment to 
winter storage in anchorage home of its alaska headquarters 
state environmental officials say exxons withdrawal is premature 
and that it should stay on the job as long as the weather permits 
we dont buy the deadline we not only want them to come back next 
year we want them to work past sept 15 bridgeman said 
over the winter exxon plans to monitor how the shoreline looks 
it has made no commitment to come back next summer but says it will 
abide by any reasonable decision of the coast guard on whether more 
cleanup is necessary 
the price tag for this summers cleanup is expected to top 12 
billion and the effort has become an industry of its own 
exxons spending spree was felt statewide and helped lower 
unemployment said state labor economist neal fried in valdez and 
cordova unemployment was about half the previous years level 
exxon has paid more than 90 million in damage claims so far and 
is paying up to 3 million a day about twothirds directly to 
fishermen who were kept in port by oilcovered water 
exxon bought 302000 pairs of rubber gloves 167000 sets of rain 
gear 73000 pairs of rubber boots 125000 coveralls and 53000 
life vests 
the company said it purchased more than 12 million pounds of 
groceries amounting to 1000 cows 360000 chickens 1000 turkeys 
and 700 pigs washing machines agitated more than 3 million pounds 
of laundry and equipment consumed more than 400000 gallons of 
diesel fuel each week

sailors according to a letter sent to hartwigs sister and revealed 
saturday

explosion that said circumstantial evidence indicated hartwig 
intentionally caused the blast hartwig a gunners mate died in 
the april 19 explosion 
kathleen kubicina hartwigs sister said she got a letter dated 
aug 27 from a sailor she would identify only as tom that said 
crew members did not believe hartwig was capable of causing the 
explosion 
the people on board who knew him believe as i do that the idea 
of clay being capable of such a crime is insane the sailor wrote 
i dont know what the reults of the investigation will be but it 
will not change mine or a lot of this crews minds as to what we 
believe could never have happened because we knew clay 
ms kubicina said the authors mother would not allow her sons 
last name to be released for fear of retaliation from the navy ms 
kubicina provided a copy of the letter to the associated press 
the iowa left its norfolk va homeport in june for six months 
in the mediterranean sea 
when i first read it i felt this incredible relief ms 
kubicina said even though it was written before the report was 
released it shows a lot of the guys support our position it made a 
world of difference to know the guys support me 
ms kubicina and hartwigs father earl have said they believe 
the navy sought a scapegoat and blamed hartwig for the explosion 
that caused the biggest loss of live in the navy since the vietnam 
war 
ms kubicina said the family planned to file a defamation of 
character lawsuit against the navy for alleging hartwig may have 
caused the explosion 
we will file because this has caused undue emotional distress 
to the family she said

shrimpers blockaded boat traffic friday to 
protest federal requirements that they use turtleprotecting devices 
in their nets and apparently won a promise from visiting president 
bush to review the rules 
the coast guard said 37 vessels up to 100 feet long participated 
in the daylong blockade of an industrial waterway near this gulf 
coast city but protesters put the number of boats at 50 to 100 
at one point 30 vessels were waiting to pass through the 
blockade said chief petty officer glenn lamont 
the protest ended at 5 pm after the coast guard relayed word 
from rep billy tauzin dla that bush who was visiting new 
orleans about 50 miles north of here had agreed to review the 
regulations 
in a meeting with tauzin and reps lindy boggs dla and bob 
livingston rla bush promised a review of regulations concerning 
turtle excluder devices or teds tauzin said in a news release 
the congressman said white house chief of staff john sununu would 
meet with commerce secretary robert mosbacher and will hopefully 
reach an acceptable balance between the need to conserve endangered 
turtle species and allow shrimpers to stay in business 
shrimpers and their supporters in congress have succeeded in the 
past in having ted rules delayed for weeks and sometimes months at a 
time shrimpers also organized blockades in protest in july 
about 500 shrimpers from louisiana mississippi alabama and 
florida lined the motorcade route used by bush during his visit 
friday morning 
no arrests were made and no violence was reported during the 
protest said coast guard cmdr william loeftstedt 
another 30 to 40 shrimpers blocked the intracoastal waterway near 
intracoastal city la said chief petty officer glenn lamont no 
arrests or violence was reported 
the blockaders were violating the law and those who violate it 
could find themselves in trouble if they persist loeftstedt said 
blockading vessels were warned throughout the day to clear a 
passage or the vessels could be boarded and crews arrested said 
cmdr dave smith 
the coast guard gathered names and boat registration numbers of 
the protesters no decision was made on whether to charge them but 
the shrimpers could face civil fines of up to 25000 if charged 
loeftstedt said 
several angry shrimpers were glad to have the presidents ear but 
said they were only willing to wait a short while for new rules 
right now shrimpers are in a nowin situation said randy 
adams captain of the sunshine lady they change the rules every 
three minutes and you cant win with any of them if you pull a 
ted you cant make any money if you dont you get fined 
designed to keep endangered sea turtles from being snared and 
drowned in shrimp nets teds are cagelike devices with trap doors 
and slats designed to deflect turtles out of the nets while 
preserving the shrimp catch 
shrimpers however claim they lose large amounts of shrimp 
because of the teds and say they cant afford to operate with them

the bath iron works built 83 destroyers in 
world war ii more than turned out by all the shipyards of japan 
this week it launches the lead ship in the navys new class of 
destroyers hailed as the worlds most advanced surface combat ship 
and 200 times more expensive than those built here 4 decades ago 
sailorturnedshipbuilder bob bourget spent three years aboard 
one of the tin can destroyers produced in bath during the war 
so he speaks from experience when he praises the combat capability 
of the ships built in this small city along the kennebec river 
bourget was on the uss stembel seeing action in the pacific from 
tarawa to okinawa before returning home to build ships at biw 
bourget says the durable destroyer is still in service with the 
argentine navy 
thats the same kind of ship theyre going to get there except 
with a lot more technology bourget said pointing to the ways 
cradling the navys new destroyer the arleigh burke 
the new ship is to be launched saturday in a ceremony that will 
focus on one of the legendary leaders of world war ii 
burke an 87yearold retired admiral will be guest of honor at 
the launching his wife roberta will christen the ship and about 
400 veterans who served in burkes famed little beavers 
destroyer squadron are scheduled to join him at a postlaunch dinner 
known as 31knot burke for the speed with which he pushed his 
destroyers in pursuit of the japanese burke has kept tabs on the 
design and construction of the ship that will bear his name 
widebeamed with a low profile the 466foot ship bears little 
resemblance to the earlier generations of destroyers the roughly 1 
billion it cost to build is more than double the price of all of the 
destroyers built here in world war ii when the yard turned out one 
every 17 days at the height of production 
while critics suggest the nation might be better served by a 
larger number of smaller less expensive ships navy and biw 
officials maintain the arleigh burke destroyers are being built for 
the type of warfare in which threats from aircraft submarines and 
surface ships must be dealt with instantly 
its really the first surface ship thats been designed and 
built to meet the warfare requirements of the 21st century said 
william e haggett biw chairman and chief executive officer 
much of the cost is earmarked for sophisticated aegis computers 
electronics and weaponry including tomahawk cruise missiles 
antiaircraft missiles antisubmarine torpedoes and a 54caliber 
gun 
to enhance its prospects of survival the 8500ton arleigh burke 
was designed with a more expensive allsteel superstructure instead 
of one that was part aluminum and would be more prone to splintering 
and fire damage designers also built in better protection against 
nuclear blast radioactive fallout and chemical warfare agents 
haggett says ships of the future must have capabilities far more 
advanced than those of todays fleet 
they have to be able to detect engage and eliminate targets 
that can come from any direction at almost any speed and in large 
numbers a lot of inferior ships out there in the kind of battle a 
destroyer is designed to engage in would be meaningless 
this ship is as capable as perhaps 20 or 40 ships that are of 
an older design he said 
the arleigh burke program is also seen as the key to future 
prosperity of the 105yearold shipyard which has found itself 
competing for a dwindling number of navy contracts at a time when 
civilian ship construction is virtually nonexistent in the united 
states 
while other major yards have closed or gone into bankruptcy bath 
and its archrival littons ingalls shipbuilding division in 
mississippi are among a handful of survivors 
thanks to its participation with ingalls in the aegis cruiser 
program biw now has a 2 billion construction backlog and a 
workforce that remains at a peacetime high of 11000 
but with cruiser construction winding down the aegis destroyer 
program was viewed as vital because it was seen as the last surface 
ship the navy plans to build for some time 
unlike the cruisers which combined the aegis systems with the 
modified design of an existing destroyer the arleigh burke is an 
entirely new ship designed from the keel up to accommodate the 
advanced technology 
winning the contract for design and construction of the lead ship 
gave biw a leg up and the yard now has contracts for five of the 
destroyers to ingalls three haggett said the navy plans to build 
five more per year for an indefinite period and his yard plans to 
compete vigorously for its share of the contracts 
haggett said the arleigh burke scheduled for delivery in 1991 
is the kind of ship that would make a potential adversary think 
twice before challenging it 
probably the greatest value of these aegis ships is that they 
are so good that they become a very meaningful deterrent to any kind 
of hostilities he said

the replacements four rock n roll bad boys 
beloved by college radio stations worshipped by a musical 
underground but known by few others might just make the big time 
then again maybe not 
the minneapolis quartet which started out in 1980 with fast 
rough thrashy rock tunes colored with adolescent anger and wit 
released its seventh album this year the third with warner bros 
subsidiary sire records and spent the summer touring with tom 
petty 
musician magazine in a cover story in february proclaimed 
portentously that they were the last best band of the 80s 
no doubt they are the closest ever to major recognition in the 
mainstream market but lead singer and songwriter paul westerberg 
said their brush with success could be shoved aside for another 
pursuit namely obscurity 
we dont embrace success he said over breakfast his voice 
deep and hoarse cut rough from a performance the night before if 
it happens it happens we arent really trying to kill ourselves to 
get it 
such a nonchalant attitude may sound a bit selfdefeating but 
its not that the replacements welcome failure 
success westerberg said can be a trap 
for instance on dont tell a soul their latest album there 
was a major push by warner and the band to get the single ill be 
you high on the charts album sales passed a respectable 350000 
but ill be you didnt do well on the charts 
when ill be you dropped off the top 40 i was going damn 
westerberg said but now i go great because now its not 
like ill be you is no 1 and ill have to play it for the rest of 
my life next year no one will even remember it so i can play 
whatever i want 
the replacements were discovered when westerberg gave a tape to 
peter jesperson who was booking bands at a minneapolis nightclub 
and had a small record label called twintone jesperson recalled 
that westerberg was hoping to get a 25 gig warming up for one of 
the topbilled groups 
but after the first play i immediately called them back and 
said were you thinking of 45 or album 
i swear it was about 20 seconds into the first song that 
something got me deep down i actually called three of my best 
musical pals at the time and said you have to come over right now 
either im out of my mind or this is the greatest rock band ive 
heard in ages it was a real inspirational moment one id consider 
calling magic 
jesperson managed the band for six years going to almost every 
gig as they crisscrossed the country playing smaller venues and 
building a reputation for their chaotic unpredictable and often 
drunken shows 
stories abounded about the recklessness of the young band 
bassist tommy stinson was just 12 years old and westerberg the 
oldest was 20 former lead guitarist bob stinson tommys older 
brother was often the ringleader showing up for gigs smashed he 
once performed in the nude 
he was kicked out of the band when he couldnt adapt to more 
tasteful or quieter things westerberg said and now has a band in 
minneapolis called static taxi 
the spectacle of westerbergs highwire act also was a big draw 
reeling drunk hed often forget words of a song halfway through 
sometimes they would refuse to play their own tunes and launch into 
an hour of covers like yummy yummy or hitchin a ride 
once the band reportedly stopped suddenly gave their instruments 
to the audience and told them to play another tale has it that 
westerberg tossed all the cash from his pockets to the audience and 
told the crowd to ask for a refund because they played so badly 
but he had enough savvy to know its not necessarily what you 
play but how you play it that counts and if youre lucky the crowd 
will remember both 
we did it because we wanted to make an impact if we played on 
the weekend we wanted to make sure there were people talking about 
us on monday if that meant being absolutely horrid than thats 
what wed do 
and adding another essential ingredient of the classic rock n 
roll fable the outrageous shows helped disguise the fact that they 
didnt know how to play their instruments 
when we started we werent good musicians westerberg said 
we were smart enough to realize that playing your instrument is 
not going to get us anywhere so we just created a smoke screen 
until we learned how to play 
while they learned to play westerberg learned to write better 
songs the first albums sorry ma forgot to throw out the 
trash the replacements stink and hootenanny often 
chronicled an inane silly side of youth with songs like more 
cigarettes hangin downtown and dope smokin moron 
but in the last few tim pleased to meet me and dont 
tell a soul westerberg reflects the loss of a friend to suicide 
the conflicts of commercialism romantic longing and loneliness 
in i dont know from pleased to meet me he talks about 
the bands precarious position straddling corporate recordindustry 
success after being so aligned with scrapy rock n rollers one 
foot in the door the other in the gutter the sweet smell you 
adore i think id rather smother

it sounds like the plot of a steamy novel 
dashing doctor finds success and riches in smalltown america leads 
charmed life until sex scandal erupts and hes in the middle of it 
but its fact not fiction in this tranquil town 
the protagonist is dr pravin thakkar accused of gross 
negligence lewd conduct rape and other offenses against more than 
a dozen women many are expatients in some cases women he dated 
say he impregnated them and then performed abortions without their 
consent 
weve had lewd and immoral allegations before but never in 
this volume against one man said dan foley assistant to state 
attorney general linley pearson whose office filed a complaint 
against thakkar 
thakkar whose license has been temporarily suspended denies the 
charges and says hell be vindicated 
you are giving a forum to people who are lying and trying 
to cash in he said these are not the facts 
jeffrey lockwood his attorney added many of the allegations 
if not all of them are not worthy of belief 
madison county prosecutor william lawler says charges involving 
five women and a sixth unrelated accusation will likely be presented 
to a grand jury within several weeks 
a 23count state complaint pending before the indiana medical 
licensing board accuses him of a litany of misconduct including 
prescribing an addictive drug to a patient as long as she would have 
pelvic exams fondling patients in the examining room forcing a 
woman to have sex in her house impregnating women then performing 
unwanted abortions 
separate suits and malpractice claims are pending against thakkar 
he also faces an october trial on charges that he withdrew more 
than 132000 from his bank accounts in a way that allegedly skirted 
federal rules on reporting withdrawals 
many of thakkars accusers came forward at a february state board 
hearing that resulted in the temporary suspension of his license a 
hearing on whether to revoke the license has not been scheduled 
one panel member called it probably the worst abuse of 
physicianpatient trust hed seen the board called thakkar a 
clear and immediate danger to the public health and safety 
the commonality of all of their stories was pretty 
convincing foley said 
since then the indianapolis star reported thakkar left an ohio 
medical training program in 1980 amid charges he had a sexual 
encounter with a patient and mishandled a case in which a woman 
hemorrhaged to death after giving birth 
court records claim thakkar left a texas medical residency 
program in 1981 after a patient complained he made sexual comments 
and was known as a doctor who would conduct a pelvic exam for a 
head cold 
carmen brutchen hertzinger a divorced teachers aide claims 
thakkar impregnated her in 1983 then pressured her to have an 
abortion 
i said no way i want this baby i love you she recalled 
when she refused she claims he drugged her induced labor 
without her consent and delivered an 8monthold fetus she contends 
she heard a cry but never saw the baby and thakkar told her it was 
stillborn and claimed to have six bullets to kill her others 
and himself if she revealed what happened 
ms hertzinger has sued thakkar he has responded with a slander 
suit claiming she was still pregnant more than a month after the 
alleged abortion 
i think he specifically sought out women who were emotionally 
vulnerable said bonnie coffeymyers who answered a personal ad 
thakkar placed in indianapolis monthly magazine 
i was overweight divorced raising two kids on my own 
attracting the attention of a healthy intelligent wealthy 
powerful physician she said its every womans dream 
ms coffeymyers said after she became pregnant thakkar told her 
hed perform an abortion but would have to falsify records because 
the procedure wasnt allowed at the hospital 
despite the allegations thakkar has supporters 
hes one of the finest doctors ive ever had joyce thompson 
wrote in a local newspaper letter hes always been there when 
needed taken great care and showed genuine concern for me 
but thakkars lawyer said such support may have little impact 
hes already been tried and convicted in the press lockwood 
said noting some of his clients accusers have made the 
oprahgeraldo talk show circuit 
a small group of people are getting an awful lot of media 
attention and feel theyre going to get an awful lot of money 
from the doctor 
pravin thakkar 38 came to this central indiana town of 2000 in 
1981 replacing the only doctor who had died 
he was a congenial sort of person said gerald harper a 
member of the lions club which organized a doctorsearch committee 
he seemed very settled in his ways thakkar was married at 
the time and he has a child 
he seemed like he cared about whether you were ill and he would 
be available whenever possible said betty janney clerktreasurer 
in nearby gaston where he had a parttime practice 
the man who had known poverty in india built a prosperous 
practice earning a reported gross annual income of 500000 
some women met him as a patient but thakkar also placed blindbox 
newspaper and magazine ads he met his current fiancee through one 
describing himself as filled with dreams love amp sensitivity 
for some the 5foot6 graying doctor lived up to his claims 
wooing women with soft music sweet words and a soothing manner 
its almost like having a spell put over you ms hertzinger 
said 
he was like no other man id ever met said kathy collins 
the first to sue thakkar he was very soft he was very caring 
ms collins says she met thakkar as a patient and after years of 
onandoff dating became pregnant when she told him she says he 
aborted the fetus without her consent 
i hurt so bad inside i knew i had to do something she 
explained i just knew that i couldnt go on knowing what he did 
and letting him get away with it 
her suit opened the floodgates many allegations are several 
years old raising questions as to why some women waited so long and 
continued to see him as their doctor 
if they thought he was a heel why did they go back to 
him asked harper of the lions club it just dont make sense 
some of the women cited financial reasons coffeymyers said 
thakkar agreed to do her tubal ligation for whatever fee her 
insurance would cover 
some feared they wouldnt be believed challenging a doctor 
once they saw others coming forward they thought if they banded 
together with other folks maybe something would be done added 
foley the attorney generals aide 
today they have mixed feelings about thakkar 
my attitude ranges from pity to hatred said ms 
coffeymyers perhaps some of us were naive and gave him the 
benefit of the doubt too many times that doesnt mean any of us 
deserved what we got i feel much the same way a rape victim does

if deborah epstein popper and frank popper 
werent from new jersey it might be easier to win converts to their 
notion that the great plains ought to be emptied of people and given 
back to the buffalo and the tall grasses 
but the poppers are professors at rutgers university in new 
jersey a state that is the butt of more than a few jokes and that 
makes them easy targets for more of the same 
prominent among their critics is rep pat roberts a republican 
who represents most of western kansas and who says that every time 
the region goes through hard times you get another thinktank 
effort to send us back to the buffalo 
we still believe woody allen was joking when he claimed every 
place has redeeming social value with the possible exception of new 
jersey the congressman wrote to the washington post we only 
hope the poppers were joking as well 
the fargo forum in north dakota suggested in an editorial that 
instead of letting the plains slip back into grasslands new jersey 
might be turned into a vast gasoline storage area 
a montana paper suggested paving over the garden state 
the high plains journal of dodge city kan called the plan a 
real buffalo pie in the sky idea and mike hayden governor of 
kansas said i can only conclude their suggestions were in jest 
not at all the poppers hes harvardeducated originally from 
chicago and teaches urban studies shes from new york did 
graduate work at rutgers and teaches geography are serious 
we believe that over the next generation the plains will as a 
result of the largest longestrunning agricultural and 
environmental miscalculation in america become almost totally 
depopulated they wrote in planning magazine published by the 
american planning association 
it was a historic mistake they say to break the sod a process 
started by the 1862 homestead act which gave 160 acres to anyone 
who would settle the land and stay five years 
the plains they say are inhospitable to agriculture and subject 
to dust bowls windstorms and droughts that will only worsen as the 
water table falls 
endlessly windswept nearly treeless semiarid austerely 
beautiful historically untenable increasingly empty and now facing 
ecological devastation almost all of the area from the 98th 
meridian west to the rockies ultimately will become deserted the 
poppers predict 
the only question they say is whether the process will be eased 
through government intervention or imposed brutally by raw market 
forces 
in an interview popper argued that without subsidies the plains 
cannot sustain agricultural life and as grammrudman kicks in it 
is not going to make sense to keep subsidizing agriculture when what 
the plains produce mostly adds to national farm surpluses that are 
already too big 
so instead they propose letting the government gradually buy 
back farmland and tear down the fences replant the shortgrass and 
restock the animals including many bison creating what we would 
call the buffalo commons 
they figure in 20 to 30 years vegetation and wildlife could 
reassert themselves and the plains would be restored to their 
prewhite condition 
were not talking about some awful rural version of urban 
renewal says potter were talking about a longterm 
demographiceconomic evolution that would occur regardless of 
whatever government does an evolution that is market driven 
vast areas are involved the poppers are talking about a third to 
half the area of 10 states most of the dakotas the western 
twothirds of nebraska the western halves of kansas oklahoma and 
texas the eastern tips of new mexico and colorado eastern wyoming 
and all but westernmost montana 
the only way to keep the plains from turning into an utter 
wasteland an american empty quarter will be for the federal 
government to step in and buy the land in short to deprivatize 
it the poppers wrote 
small service center cities such as bismarck nd and 
cheyenne wyo or towns near interstate highways might stay in 
business so would locales able to sustain themselves through 
agriculture energy development or tourism but theyre few the 
poppers say 
the buffalo commons will become the worlds largest historic 
preservation project the ultimate national park they wrote 
much of the great plains will become what all of the united states 
once was a vast land mass largely empty and unexploited 
mrs popper says shes been overwhelmed by the reaction to their 
article the idea certainly has struck a nerve 
and even the people who say we are crazy she says usually 
concede the area has serious problems 
the government is not looking for new ways to spend money 
mrs popper says we see this happening only after greater 
devastation greater catastrophe 
adds popper we would like not to see it happen we both like 
the great plains if our proposal is able to prevent this disaster 
from occurring wed be delighted 
for all their plains states critics some there acknowledge the 
poppers have hit upon a home truth 
i agree with frank that it was a miscalculation when the social 
engineers put as many people as they did out here through that 
homestead act says rancher jim strain of rapid city sd who 
runs the american cowmans association 
but i dont agree it should be a buffalo commons i think it 
was meant to be a vast grasslands for producers of redmeat animals 
to graze their herds on it was a mistake to plow this land with its 
limited topsoil and limited moisture the natural grasses which 
nature had matched to the soil types preserved the soil and they had 
a natural value which is grazing 
in their hearts would his fellow plains people agree 
it would be a 5050 split says strain there are people 
who make some pretty good bucks out of this government 
intervention 
mark lapping dean of architecture at kansas state university 
says the poppers are wrong about one thing deprivitization is 
something that will not happen 
he adds there will always be some very large islands of 
population and economic activity while we see depopulatization of 
many small towns were seeing the creation of many larger and 
economically viable regions those people are not moving to 
washington or kansas city but to garden city and liberal and 
manhattan and lawrence and other places that have sufficient scale 
and diversity 
and geographer bret wallach of the university of oklahoma said 
the poppers are a bit quixotic in the short term but in the long 
run it is an idea whose time will probably come 
this country probably has a lot more cropland than in the long 
run it will need and we ouight to think about what to do with it 
wallach says 
countries in the third world are going to be able to take care 
of themselves one of these days he says in new england they 
let the farmland grow back into trees and maybe that is the 
enlightened thing to do restore it to its virgin use

in a survey of chief executives a few weeks ago 
about 60 percent said that over the next two years recession not 
inflation was the biggest threat facing the economy 
at the same time a commerce department survey shows businesses 
were expressing optimism about the economy by raising their capital 
outlays 7 percent over a year ago with much of the money going for 
expansion 
the same dichotomy shows up in consumer surveys those 
interviewed express fear of a recession but then go out and buy cars 
and houses strengthening those industries at the very time 
economists are warning of turndowns 
everyone talks about recession economists business people 
consumers government officials academics students but do they 
really believe a recession is imminent that it seems is an 
entirely different matter 
part of the explanation lies in the conviction that after seven 
years of expansion an unusually long growth period the economy 
must have a recession hasnt it always been that way arent 
recessions necessary to restore balance 
throughout this century at least recessions have indeed been 
viewed as antidotes to excesses in buying borrowing and 
expectations and there is lots of circumstantial evidence to 
suggest officials have deliberately created them 
but there is nothing sacred or inevitable about recessions 
nothing in the books that says economies must have recessions which 
generally if not officially are said to involve two successive 
quarters of economic shrinkage 
many economists believe that in some instances an economic 
slowdown might accomplish all the correction necessary reduce 
expectations discourage debt and overspending lessen strains on 
capacity without shrinking output 
in fact the possibility of doing that very thing is the current 
aim of the federal reserve board its reason for tightening or 
loosening the money supply for raising not raising or even 
lowering interest rates 
that effort as some economists view it might very well result 
in a growth recession a contradictory term that nevertheless 
suggests an economy continuing to move forward but at an almost 
imperceptible rate 
more and more economists today speak of rolling recessions in 
which the economy never shrinks as a whole while separate industries 
within the economy go through private downturns at different times 
in such a situation the national statistics never show a 
recession but for practical purposes something did occur that had a 
similar impact within the past seven years there are indications 
that it actually has happened 
something similar occurs when the economy in some geographical 
areas of the country shrinks while expansion even boom occurs 
elsewhere averaged out the national economy does not have a 
recession but recession has occurred 
within recent years for instance large areas of the country 
experienced severe downturns because of simultaneous problems in 
energy agriculture manufacturing and mining but coastal booms 
prevented an official recession 
for those who continue to fear a recession simply because the 
current expansion is so old there might be some solace therefore 
in the notion that official statistics aside the economy might 
already have had its recession 
in 1984 one analyst sindlinger amp co estimated that 34 states 
involving a majority of the nations land area had fallen into 
recession some of them very deeply offsetting booms elsewhere hid 
the fact at least statistically 
for practical rather than statistical purposes those downturns 
may have accomplished the same results if so the current economic 
expansion might not be so sold as it seems and things might even be 
looking up 
the university of michigan economic outlook which has a pretty 
fair record for anticipating events over the year to come calls for 
the current slowdown to bottom out by the end of the year without 
turning into recession 
no boom say the michigan economists but no recession either 
official or unofficial

the new highs reached by the dow jones industrial 
average in late august have so far proved to be more of a letdown 
than a breakthrough for the stock market 
some observers had thought that when the dow average at last 
surpassed its 1987 peaks the many skeptics who had doubted the 
durability of the markets postcrash recovery would surrender and 
join in the party 
but so far they have instead dug in their heels intensifying 
their predictions of an impending correction or something worse 
as analysts at the merrill lynch market letter put it the dow 
jones industrial average has finally made a new record high but the 
general market picture hasnt changed much in the past two weeks 
the move to a new high marks an important step in the markets 
recovery from the october 1987 collapse but we doubt that it will 
lead to a substantial new advance at this time 
there wasnt much followthrough to the new high and we think 
that will continue to be the case 
some analysts say a primary obstacle in the markets path is the 
risk that the economy will fail to live up to some very high 
expectations 
wall street thinks that business will rebound next year we 
doubt it says erich heinemann chief economist at ladenburg 
thalmann amp co tight money and falling profits have the economy on 
track to a modest downturn 
to other doubters the problem lies in the recent performance of 
stock prices themselves 
i believe there are a number of disturbing similarities between 
the rally of 1989 and the rally of 1987 says charles laloggia a 
rochester ny investment adviser 
just as in 1987 he points out the number of new individual 
highs on the new york stock exchange has been declining 
significantly even as the dow has been making new highs 
this situation reached a new level of absurdity on monday aug 
28 when only 90 stocks or 45 percent of the stocks traded on the 
nyse were able to make new 52week highs as the dow rose to a new 
record 
this is a signal that the rally is thinning out and taking 
progressively fewer stocks along for the ride and thats almost 
always a sign that the advance is in its final phase 
investors apparently took such warnings to heart in the past 
week the dow jones industrials fell 4255 points to 270954 
ending a run of nine straight weekly gains 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 242 to 
19395 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
lost 003 to 47131 while the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 14 at 38410 
big board volume averaged 15531 million shares a day against 
15149 million the week before 
some bulls on the market outlook arent at all distressed that 
the new highs this summer have produced so little enthusiasm 
in fact they contend the longer it takes to convert the bears 
the more room stocks may find to keep on rising 
this years rally has been strange in that each minimove up 
was met with doubt said william lefevre at advest inc each 
move up brought a new set of reasons why the rally couldnt continue 
as the doubts grew so did the markets gains the old cliche 
every bull market climbs a wall of worry was never truer

japanese investors get the headlines but the 
british have been on a buying spree for control of american 
companies that range from pineapple harvesters to typewriter makers 
standard oil co to burger king 
britain is the biggest foreign investor in the united states as 
it has been since colonial days what is less widely known is that 
britain is actually extending its lead over japan as well as the 
no3 netherlands and others 
british investors added 215 billion to their direct investments 
in the united states last year compared with additions of 142 
billion for japan commerce department figures show 
it appears that britains lead is widening even further in 1989 
grand metropolitan plc bought pillsbury co for 58 billion a 
deal that gave it such famous names as green giant haagendazs and 
burger king 
late last month bass plc agreed to buy holiday inns inc the 
nations innkeeper for 22 billion 
just this past week polly peck plc agreed to pay 875 million 
for a very large quantity of pineapples bananas papayas and 
mangoes the fresh fruit operations of rjr nabisco incs del monte 
foods inc 
economics would seem to give japan the edge over britain in 
buying into the united states japan accumulates huge sums of 
dollars through its bulging trade surplus with the united states 
which was greater than 50 billion last year in contrast britain 
ran a slender trade deficit with the united states in 1988 
but britain moves more boldly into the united states than japan 
does because of its history of internationalism the ease of dealing 
with another englishspeaking nation and the momentum generated by 
past dealings 
the japanese have the ability to be the largest acquirer in the 
united states but the british have the incentive said mark 
dixon editor of the britishamerican deal review in new york 
british companies are aggressive entrepreneurial 
international dixon said in terms of moving into foreign 
markets they are probably at the moment the most pioneering in the 
world 
in contrast dixon said the japanese are very cautious and 
they end up missing opportunities 
analysts say japanese investors get most of the attention from 
the news media and politicians because they are seen as a bigger 
threat to usbased competitors differences in race and culture 
probably add to the discomfort on both sides analysts add 
while japanese investment is concentrated in heavy industry and 
high technology for example steel autos and computers british 
investment is across the board

robert campeau was on top of the world a year and 
ahalf ago gloating after his victory in the twomonthlong battle 
for federated department stores inc 
the real estate developer who already had allied stores corp 
among his holdings had dreams of a real estate and retailing 
empire with the crown jewel of department store chains 
bloomingdales giving him an entree into new shopping malls in 
untapped markets 
but those dreams are all but shattered now as campeau unable to 
handle his companys massive debt as the retail business soured has 
been forced to put his prize chain on the block 
bloomingdales would be the last thing he would want to sell 
walter loeb a retail industry analyst with morgan stanley amp co 
inc said of campeau last week 
but campeau has no choice but to sell he faces an estimated 450 
million loan payment that is coming due he doesnt have the cash on 
hand to pay it and selling the coveted bloomies is the fastest way 
to get that cash 
in a statement friday announcing campeaus plans to sell the 
chain and undertake a financial restructuring the developers 
holding company campeau corp tried to put the best face on what 
could only be called a defeat 
following the bloomingdales divestiture federated and allied 
will continue to be a major force in us retailing 
campeau will still own 240 department stores including allieds 
the bon jordan marsh maas brothers and sterns stores and 
federateds abraham amp straus burdines goldsmiths lazarus and 
richs chains but without bloomingdales now a part of federated 
he will not have the same influence in shopping center development 
that he had hoped to possess 
and the forced sale of bloomingdales is a black mark on his 
financial reputation 
robert campeau was a virtually unknown canadian developer when 
in late 1986 he launched a hostile bid for allied he won the 
company paying 34 billion and then began to unload most of 
allieds store units to help pay off his bank loans 
in january 1988 just a year after closing on the allied deal he 
began his run at federated campeau found himself in a bidding war 
with rh macy amp co inc one that drove up the price for the 
company until campeau ended up paying 66 billion for the 
retailers shares and a total of 88 billion for the entire 
company once costs were figured in 
that price is what did campeau in 
they paid too much for it said pamela stubing an analyst 
with moodys investors service 
campeau took over staggering bank loans and sold billions of 
dollars in junk bonds to finance his deals he also sold off 
billions of dollars in assets leaving only department stores and 
their valuable real estate in his retail portfolio 
he was depending on the stores to generate enough cash flow to 
pay the debt but the stagnant consumer spending climate has taken a 
larger toll on sales than he expected 
they were optimistic in the early part of the year looking for 
a 5 to 6 percent increase in sales but that might not have come 
true in the second quarter said edward johnson an analyst with 
prescott ball amp turben 
campeau is not the only developerturnedretailer to run into 
problems lj hooker corp which owns the bonwit teller and b 
altman chains in the united states has run into financial problems 
in its home country australia and its retail operations here have 
suffered as well 
hookers us subsidiary was forced to file for protection under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in new york 
analysts say developers have bitten off more than they could chew 
developers should never have taken on this kind of debt 
given the uncertain nature of retailing morgan stanleys loeb said 
ms stubing agreed developers look on the properties as an 
asset but its a working asset and its only valuable if you make 
money from it she said 
though they knew the value of the real estate they didnt 
know what they could get from it with the cash flow she said 
when campeau bought federated the retailing industry was already 
mired in a sales slump the developer claimed that he had factored a 
continuation of the downturn into his plans 
johnson said increasing competition from stores like the booming 
nordstrom chain has hurt the big department stores 
another problem campeau has faced and likely caused is the 
high management turnover since the chains were acquired several 
highlevel executives at campeau corp and the retail companies have 
come and gone in the past two years and this has not helped matters 
whenever you have changes at the top continuing it puts 
adverse pressure on the management underneath johnson said 
if the developers have good retail management they have a better 
chance of succeeding but if theyre looking to pyramid the 
profits without trying to run a solid merchandising operation 
they cant get the cash flow they need johnson said
