in the east bloc in 42 years with solidarity confident of success 
and the communist party braced for a feared poor showing 
poles living under the communist system since the end of world 
war ii began voting at 6 am for a senate in which solidarity 
candidates are running for all 100 seats 
opposition and independent candidates also were allowed to run 
for 161 of the 460 seats in the sejm or parliament the polls were 
to close at 10 pm 
surveys projected that 80 percent of the nations 27 million 
eligible voters would cast ballots the national election 
commission said final results might not be available until 
wednesday or thursday 
thousands of polish immigrants filed absentee ballots saturday 
at polish consulates in new york chicago and washington 
this is pure satisfaction said jack piotrowski 38 of 
butler nj who came to america six years ago and cast his ballot 
in new york city 
im a bit surprised said tomasz zalewski 41 of brooklyn 
an official poll watcher for solidarity i didnt expect such a 
turnout 
a consular official in new york said 5000 people had registered 
to vote and by 3 pm saturday 3500 people had cast ballots in 
chicago thousands of poles braved thunderstorms and hourlong waits 
to vote 
solidarity leader lech walesa was cheered saturday night at a 
tumultuous rally outside his modest home in the port city of 
gdansk we showed the world we can fight now lets show we can 
do things peacefully he said 
more than 500 cars drove by filled with solidarity supporters 
who flashed the vforvictory sign 
walesa held a private party at his home before the rally and the 
house was filled with wellwishers president george bush is 
scheduled to have lunch there with walesa and his family when the 
us leader visits gdansk in july 
this is a rehearsal for bushs visit walesa told the 
associated press with a hearty laugh 
if 80 percent of the voters cast ballots it will be one of the 
highest turnouts in years a national referendum in 1987 on 
political and economic reform drew 673 percent of the voters in 
elections in june 1988 for local and provincial councils the 
government reported a 56 percent turnout 
relatively free elections occurred in poland in 1947 with some 
opposition but the communist party won the balloting and 
established complete political control 
solidarity has taken numerous steps to try to ensure sundays 
election is honest 
opposition representatives serve on commissions conducting the 
elections and solidarity recruited more than 100000 poll watchers 
at solidarity headquarters saturday workers scrambled to 
identify polling places and set up an unofficial vote tabulation 
system 
communist party leader wojciech jaruzelski in a tv address 
friday night stressed accommodation and said the party would be 
interested in forming a broad postelection coalition 
walesa an interview taped for broadcast saturday night urged 
restraint saying too much emotion could frighten the other side 
and destroy us 
lastminute campaign skirmishes continued saturday a party 
spokesman accused solidarity of rejecting a moratorium on 
campaigning saturday and sunday 
but the union denied there was such a proposal and solidarity 
candidates held rallies as rain drenched warsaw 
while the senate voting is fully democratic the existing 
parliament made up of one chamber called the sejm will remain 
in the control of the party by virtue of a deal authorities made 
with the solidarityled opposition on april 5 
independent candidates were permitted to run for 161 or 35 
percent of the 460 sejm seats the rest were reserved for 
candidates from the party and its allies 
but the party could end up with fewer seats than the 65 percent 
expected if voters reject the national list of 35 prominent 
politicians running unopposed the list includes no 2 in the 
party jozef czyrek prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski and 
interior minister czeslaw kiszczak 
if the national list candidates do not receive at least 50 
percent of the vote their seats will not be filled 
it is possible the communists could have only a threevote 
majority when the sejm and senate convene to choose a president 
next month 
party leaders in the last days of the campaign stressed that the 
national list candidates should be elected for the sake of the 
april agreement 
when one appeals to cross out the national list then the 
campaign becomes a confrontation party secretary stanislaw 
ciosek said saturday 
czyrek said rejection of the list could lead to a constitutional 
impasse that might have to be resolved in court because the 
constitution says the sejm should have 460 members 
as part of the april agreement between the government and the 
opposition solidarity regained legal status after a sevenyear ban 
imposed during a martial law crackdown in december 1981

a former us hostage in iran said the death of the ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini ends a nightmare for the former captives and for 
the islamic republic itself and opposition figures sunday 
predicted major changes in iran 
im not the type to say im happy hes dead said former 
hostage barry rosen one of the 52 hostages held 444 days by 
radical iranian students from 1979 to 1981 but i do feel to a 
certain degree that that part of the nightmare is over for us and 
for iran 
a former president of the islamic republic abolhassan 
banisadr likened khomeinis death to the death of spanish 
dictator franco and said it could mean iran would like spain 
turn toward democracy 
the dictatorship is at an impasse in iran banisadr said 
iran made a revolution for democracy there is no other solution 
for iran but democracy 
khomeini 86 died 12 days after undergoing surgery for bleeding 
in his digestive system according to the official iranian news 
agency 
for those iranians who followed and worshipped him as a 
religious leader its a tremendous tragedy but i dont see his 
death as a tragedy i see the tragedy in him coming to power at 
that time in irans history said rosen assistant to the 
president of brooklyn college 
he had his own moral standards i think he hurt millions of 
people not just outside of iran but many iranians have died because 
of khomeini he has caused a lot of pain all over the world 
rosen said 
banisadr said khomeinis death opened three possibilities a 
war of succession power held by a troika of parliament speaker 
abolhassan rafsanjani president ali khamenei and khomeinis son 
ahmed khomeini or a turn to democracy 
given the weakness of the regime i think the turn to 
democracy is the most probable banisadr said and in that case 
the death of khomeini would be like the death of franco and the 
beginning of democracy 
banisadr speaking from versailles outside of paris said 
khomeinis death makes it very probable that he will be able to 
return to iran before long and possibly become involved again in 
government 
massoud rajavi leader of the rebel peoples mujahadeen of iran 
predicted that very much like the shahs regime irans 
fundamentalist government would not survive the death of its 
spiritual leader 
the end of the regime has come and the new era for the freedom 
of the iranian people has started rajavi said in a radio 
broadcast from iraq that was quoted by alireza jafarzadeh a 
spokesman for the resistance group in washington dc 
ayatollah mehdi rouhani spiritual leader of the shiite moslem 
community in europe called on iranian defenders and opponents of 
the regime to form a united front 
the ayatollah is dead but the iranian people lives he said 
in paris i hope the courage of my people will let them build a 
regime more just than todays 
the son of the former shah of iran predicted trouble in his 
homeland and a us official familiar with policy in iran said he 
did not anticipate any drastice change in policy in tehran in 
the postkhomeini era 
the washington dcbased official said there was no question 
that iran will remain an islamic republic but just what kind of 
course theyre going to take wed be just guessing right now 
he was quite a figure for iran and its revolution theres 
been a power struggle recently but its not clear who is on top 
said the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said there were some indications that a collective leadership 
would rule iran while various individuals vied for power 
khomeini came to power after months of street protests and 
strikes that in february 1979 ousted shah mohammad reza pahlavi and 
ended 2500 years of monarchy 
the shah died in 1980 his son reza pahlavi who has lived in 
exile in europe and the united states as the pretender to the 
peacock throne saw trouble ahead 
the shah predicts a period of uncertainty turmoil and feuding 
among the factions said robert armao a spokesman in new york 
for the pahlavi family 
armao an adviser to the late shah said security reasons 
prohibited his revealing where reza pahlavi resides but said it 
was somewhere in the united states

iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini has died 11 days after undergoing surgery for bleeding in 
his digestive system the official iranian news agency reported 
sunday he was 86 
the leader of the islamic revolution and founder of the 
islamic republic imam khomeini passed away at a tehran 
hospital the islamic republic news agency reported in an urgent 
dispatch 
irna said the shiite moslem leader died saturday and that the 
body was taken to a mortuary during the night after it had been 
washed and shrouded according to islamic laws the dispatch was 
monitored in nicosia 
neither irna nor the official tehran radio which also is 
monitored in nicosia gave the immediate cause or exact time of his 
death 
the tehran radio announcer choked with emotion as he said at 7 
am sunday 1130 pm edt saturday imam khomeini has passed 
away 
khomeini is referred to by iranians as the imam or spiritual 
leader he led the 1979 revolution that toppled shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi and set up the islamic republic of iran 
a 40day mourning period was declared in iran irna and the 
radio said the radio said the burial would not take place sunday 
and urged mourners to display discipline and avoid flooding 
khomeinis residence at jamaran a tehran suburb 
the radio read a statement by president ali khamenei parliament 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani prime minister hussein musavi and chief 
justice musavi ardebili that mourned his death but gave no clue who 
would succeed him 
how can we believe that our beloved imam is no longer among 
us the statement said our lives have gone with him 
irans main opposition group the mujahedeen khalq or peoples 
holy warriors congratulated iranians on his death 
a statement by the mujahedeen khalq leader massoud rajavi sent 
by telex to the associated press from iraq said khomeini was the 
most notorious dictator of recent times 
he predicted the islamic republic would not survive the death of 
its spiritual leader 
a former president of the islamic republic abolhassan 
banisadr said iran would turn toward democracy there is no 
other solution for iran said banisadr reached at his home 
outside paris 
a former us hostage in iran said the death of khomeini ends a 
nightmare for the former captives 
im not the type to say im happy hes dead said former 
hostage barry rosen one of the hostages held 444 days by radical 
iranian students from 1979 to 1981 but i do feel to a certain 
degree that that part of the nightmare is over for us and for 
iran 
khomeini had prepared a political testament in which he is 
believed to have proposed how the country should be governed 
following his death 
the testament which the official media refer to as the divine 
political will and testament was given to parliament in december 
1987 
the radio broadcast recordings from the koran canceling all 
programs newscasts in farsi arabic and turkish were limited to 
the same oneline announcement and koranic verse 
iran on saturday had said khomeinis health was deteriorating 
and urged the nation to pray for the countrys spiritual leader 
who underwent surgery last month for bleeding in his digestive 
system 
earlier in the week the television said a slight cardiac 
complication had arisen may 27 but that it was relieved the next 
day 
khomeini had been reported ailing since he suffered a heart 
attack in 1986 since then he was rarely seen outside his home 
political turmoil has gripped the country since khomeini 
launched a radical resurgence in february with his death decree 
against british author salman rushdie for allegedly blaspheming 
against islam in his novel the satanic verses 
a purge of iranians who apparently favored rebuilding ties with 
the west followed 
khomeini in march ousted his designated successor ayatollah 
hussein ali montazeri 64 who had openly criticized the regimes 
shortcomings and then appointed a 20member committee to review 
the succession 
but in the absence of a single personality who could match the 
patriarchs political and revolutionary authority there was 
widespread speculation that iran may be ruled by a collective 
leadership 
khomeini was born sept 23 1902 the son of a religious leader 
from a village southwest of tehran after a formal islamic 
education he taught for years at qom the center of shiite learning 
in iran 
his stern morality made him a focus for opposition to the 
monarchy in iran he spent years in exile after he was banished in 
november 1964 first in turkey then in iraq where he settled in 
the shiite shrine city of najaf he later moved to france 
khomeini emerged in 1978 as the spiritual leader of a burgeoning 
revolution against the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi that was 
organized through irans shiite clergymen and their followers 
he returned to tehran in february 1979 after the shah had fled 
the country and khomeini became the supreme head of irans islamic 
revolution for life 
khomeini often spoke out against the worlddevouring 
governments the united states and the soviet union that sought 
to influence iran on nov 4 1979 iranian militants calling 
themselves followers of khomeini seized the us embassy and 52 
hostages 
by the time the hostages were all freed in january 1981 
moderates who advocated links with the outside world were ousted 
and khomeinis hardline views had prevailed 
khomeini is survived by a wife three daughters and a son ahmed

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the founder 
of irans islamic republic died in a tehran hospital at age 86 
and irans parliament met in emergency session sunday to read his 
final plans for the nations future 
khomeini died saturday with the question of who will succeed him 
unresolved iranian opposition leaders in exile said the country 
could be plunged into political turmoil 
hundreds of thousands of iranians dressed in black converged on 
khomeinis residence in the north tehran suburb of jamaran after 
news of his death was announced 
tehran television monitored in nicosia showed men and women 
clad in headtotoe black chadors beating on their heads and chests 
hysterically in a traditional show of grief 
many waved lifesize portraits of their revolutionary patriarch 
others chanted sorrow sorrow is this day khomeini the idol 
smasher is with god this day 
staterun television screened old films of the blackturbaned 
whitebearded khomeini on his return from exile in 1979 addressing 
crowds of worshippers or lying in his hospital bed after 
undergoing an operation may 23 for bleeding in his digestive system 
tehran radio blared readings from the koran islams holy book 
as the country began its 40day mourning decreed by prime minister 
hussein musavis cabinet 
khomeinis office did not say when the patriarch will be buried 
but the official islamic republic news agency said it will not 
take place today sunday despite a moslem tradition to bury the 
dead the day they die or the following day at the latest 
irna and the other media did not disclose the immediate cause of 
death 
irans 270seat parliament convened in an emergency session to 
read a political testament khomeini had written apparently to 
outline how the islamic republic should be governed after his death 
the political testament which the official media in iran 
describe as the divine political will and testament was read 
during an almost threehour meeting of parliament irna said 
khomeinis son ahmad 43 was to read the entire 20page text 
later it was unclear what it contained or whether it named a 
successor

a spring rain washed the blood off tiananmen 
square on sunday but it will take far longer to remove the stain 
of one of the most shameful acts in communist chinas history 
the killing of hundreds of unarmed citizens in a military 
blitzkrieg against the studentoccupied square could leave china 
permanently changed 
the senseless carnage in the short run could usher in a new 
dark age of political repression 
senior leader deng xiaoping already has ousted communist party 
chief zhao ziyang for refusing to go along with the crackdown on 
the prodemocracy movement now having taken the irretrievable 
step of ordering in troops to ensure his political supremacy deng 
is likely to extend the purge to a broad range of those supporting 
zhaos more moderate policies 
academics artists and writers who in past months have spoken 
out for greater democracy and condemned the power abuses of the 
communist party may face ostracism persecution or even arrest 
after much smaller prodemocracy demonstrations in the winter of 
198687 deng launched a numbing campaign against bourgeois 
liberalization or western ideas that lasted for months this 
time the repression could be harsher and last longer 
while the soviet union poland and other socialist countries 
flirt boldly with free elections china will retreat to the 
socialist dogma that so many of its own people regard with disdain 
but in the longer run the slaughter on tiananmen will come to 
haunt deng and the old guard ideologues 
the students struck a common chord with millions of workers by 
demanding an end to the privileges and corruption associated with 
the communist party the shooting of workers will increase 
disenchantment with the party and could lead to the social unrest 
deng was trying to eradicate by smashing the student protests 
dengs marketoriented economic reforms his great achievement 
over the past decade could be seriously undermined if a power 
struggle leaves chinese leaders incapable of dealing with such 
critical issues as 30 percent inflation and widespread profiteering 
political instability will also lead to a drop in foreign 
investment and tourism two sources of foreign exchange that china 
badly needs for its modernization drive 
premier li peng while triumphing over old rival zhao by siding 
with deng is now easily the most hated man in china because he 
declared martial law in beijing 
if the party elders decide that someone must be made a scapegoat 
to remove the public venom over tiananmen li is the prime 
candidate 
the peoples liberation army one of chinas few official bodies 
to have always had the trust and respect of the chinese people has 
been badly tainted by the butchery of its attack on the people of 
beijing 
even hitler and the japanese troops during world war ii didnt 
act like that said one enraged beijing citizen 
the peoples liberation army was known to be sharply divided 
about imposing martial law in beijing after the violence those 
divisions are sure to deepen 
with all these variables the position of the conservatives is 
anything but secure deng and the other old guard communists are in 
their 80s and as evidenced by the tiananmen attack are losing 
their grip on the realities of china 
the chinese people after 10 years of impressive economic gains 
and a policy of opening to the outside world know that chinas 
socialist system is outdated and unworkable and are eager to learn 
from the west 
the students goddess of democracy statue on tiananmen may 
have been bulldozed by army tanks sunday but the movement for a 
freer and fairer society is sure to rise again

parade of dance numbers from many of his greatest successes

the king and i and peter pan 
its minimal competition for best musical were black and 
blue a tapdancing and blues revue and starmites a campy 
comic strip adventure 
the heidi chronicles wendy wassersteins babyboom saga 
should add the best play tony to its list of honors which already 
include the pulitzer prize the new york drama critics circle 
award and the drama desk award 
also nominated for best play were lend me a tenor a farce

the 198889 season was a mixed year for broadway although box 
office receipts climbed to a record 262 million attendance 
slipped slightly and the number of new productions dropped to 30 a 
new low 
there was a paucity of musicals six compared with 12 the 
previous year and only jerome robbins broadway generated 
much demand at the box office it also had broadways highest 
priced ticket 55 for an orchestra or front mezzanine seat among 
the notable flops were legs diamond chu chem and welcome 
to the club 
recognizing the lack of good musicals the tony nominating 
committee eliminated two categories best book and score of a 
musical jerome robbins broadway and black and blue 
received more than one nomination in several categories 
the production of new plays increased to 12 up four from the 
198788 season and the number of revivals tripled from three to 
nine 
but much of broadways grosses over the past year were derived 
from longrunning shows including the phantom of the opera 
les miserables cats anything goes and me and my 
girl 
the 43rd annual tony awards show televised live from the 
luntfontanne theater was presented by the league of american 
theaters and producers and the american theater wing 
the winners were selected by 750 members of the theater 
community and theater journalists the tonys are named for 
antoinette perry who was a leading force in the american theater 
wing during world war ii

chinas official press sunday called the military 
raid on tiananmen square a glorious victory over 
counterrevolutionary turmoil but made no mention of the human 
carnage that accompanied it 
the one exception to the news blackout on civilian casualties 
was a maverick announcer for radio beijings englishlanguage 
service who reported that troops firing indiscriminately had 
killed thousands of people mostly innocent civilians 
the unidentified announcer in a broadcast monitored in 
washington asked listeners to protest the most barbarous 
suppression of the people he was later replaced by another 
announcer repeating the government line 
that line was that the military attack on the city during which 
hundreds of people were killed had suppressed a 
counterrevolutionary riot and was a great victory in the 
struggle to end turmoil in the capital 
announcers on national television reading from editorials in 
the official liberation army daily and xinhua news agency blamed 
the violence on a gang of robbers bent on throwing the whole 
country into confusion 
the army daily said the rioters attempted to beat up and 
kidnap army men kill and injure our cadres and fighters smash and 
burn military trucks loot weapons and ammunition storm communist 
party headquarters and the great hall of the people rob shops and 
burn down buildings 
it said the riots exposed the plots of a few and their 
sinister attempt to oppose the communist partys leadership and 
the socialist system 
xinhua said three soldiers were killed and more than 1000 
injured by thugs who burned and smashed 31 military trucks 23 
police cars two armored vehicles and 31 buses 
the official news agency also accused the independent student 
union and autonomous trade union that sprung up during the 
sevenweek democratic movement of issuing butcher knives daggers 
iron chains and other weapons to people in tiananmen square 
the reports gave no casualty figures for civilians and did not 
mention that the army breaking a government vow that troops would 
not be used on student demonstrators fired indiscriminately into 
crowds 
the accounts were in sharp contrast to those of several weeks 
ago when chinese journalists buoyed by the democracy movement 
enjoyed a brief moment of freedom to report objectively on the 
protests many joined the movement for reforms and demanded a freer 
press 
however as party hardliners gained the edge in a power struggle 
sparked by the student unrest the press quickly returned to its 
role as the propaganda medium for party policy 
the television broadcast reading a notice from the beijing 
municipal government said soldiers and police strictly observed 
discipline and said their heroic acts and glorious exploits 
have won fervent praise and strong support from the masses of 
students and citizens

would boycott meetings being held between officials in china and 
hong kong to arrange the transition to chinese sovereignity

sympathy for the suppressed masses in china 
in macao southwest of hong kong an estimated 150000 residents 
onequarter of the population in the portuguese colony 
demonstrated for four hours shouting slogans and waving banners 
that denounced li and chinese senior leader deng xiaoping 
many wept at the hong kong rally as they watched televised 
scenes or listened to news dispatches from the chinese capital 
where soldiers crushed a prodemocracy sitin and killed hundreds 
of people

chinese funeral attire and carried black flags and placards

kong is to revert to chinese sovereignty in 1997 and many hong 
kong residents are worried that this bastion of free trade will be 
smothered by communist suppression

of the population marched in what was described as the largest 
protest rally in the territorys history 
hong kongs residents 98 percent of them chinese have long

of the democracy movement has increased their anxiety 
under a sinobritish agreement signed in 1984 china promised to 
preserve hong kongs freewheeling society and economy for 50 years 
under a one country two systems concept that would allow 
capitalism to exist under communism in a government run by hong 
kong people without chinese interference

council martin lee and szeto wah announced they will not attend 
future meetings of a committee drafting a constitution under which

iranian rebels in iraq are ready to return 
to their homeland to overthrow the tehran government following the 
death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini a rebel official said sunday 
farid sulaimani spokesman of the mujahedeen khalq or peoples 
holy warriors told the associated press in a telephone interview 
that the movements military wing the national liberation army of 
iran was on maximum alert at its bases along the border 
but there was no immediate indication that the rebels irans 
main opposition group planned any military action during the 
political uncertainty in iran following khomeinis death saturday 
any military move would have to be with iraqi approval it was 
not thought likely that baghdad would permit any action that would 
jeopardize its 10monthold truce in the war with iran 
sulaimani declined comment on what moves the mujahedeen may be 
planning 
were continuing our vigilance and closely monitoring the 
situation in iran after khomeinis death he said 
great joy prevailed in our bases along the border and all our 
fighters expressed readiness to move in when the appropriate moment 
comes he reported 
suliamani said the mujahedeen would have preferred to see 
khomeini live until they overthrew him and put him on trial for 
the crimes he committed against the iranian people 
but now hes gone what remains is the overthrow of his 
regime he declared 
he said the opposition movement was optimistic khomeinis death 
will pave the way for a free democratic and stable iran 
the rebel army which has an estimated 20000 fighters has been 
on alert since tehran announced khomeini had undergone surgery to 
stop intenstinal bleeding 
mujahedeen leader massoud rajavi in a statement issued sunday 
in baghdad called on iranians to confront the illegitimate 
remnants of the khomeini regime by all available means to prepare 
for the final eradicating blow to the criminal executioners and 
until the appropriate time for the national liberation army to move 
in 
he said khomeinis death signals the collapse of the clericled 
tehran government 
this is a very important turning point he said iran is 
now in a state of extreme agitation 
military and political analysts do not believe the rebel army is 
strong enough to topple the tehran government alone 
but if a power struggle emerges in the postkhomeini era as 
many analysts have predicted the rebels might be able to tip the 
balance between the rival factions 
khomeinis march 28 dismissal of his designated successor 
ayatollah husseinali montazeri was largely because of montazeris 
sympathy for the opposition movement 
the rebel army fought alongside the iraqis against iran during 
the eightyear persian gulf war which ended with a tentative truce 
in august the two nations still are deadlocked on terms of a 
permanent peace accord 
weeks before the ceasefire the rebel army launched its biggest 
operation into western iran reaching 90 miles inside the islamic 
republic before withdrawing 
iran claimed the rebels were driven back with heavy losses 
still the raid so deep inside iran alarmed tehran 
mujahedeen officials have said that since the ceasefire their 
armys strength has increased considerably and months of intensive 
training in iraq have forged it into a far more effective 
military force than it was before 
the mujahedeen were allied with khomeini in the struggle to 
topple the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
but radicals turned on the mujahedeen and other liberal factions 
in 198081 killing and imprisoning tens of thousands of people

most americans oppose the strict confidentiality 
of aids tests favoring mandatory notification of spouses and 
health officials when the infection is discovered a national poll 
has found 
many public health officials say aids tests should be kept 
confidential to encourage people to be tested in the poll 
however 72 percent said the spouse or sexual partner of a person 
found to have aids should be told 
additionally 67 percent in the media generalassociated press 
survey said the doctor administering the test should be required to 
notify local or state public health officials of a finding of aids 
infection 
mandatory notification of other people or agencies got less 
support just four in 10 said doctors should have to report 
positive tests to the federal government or to insurance companies 
and three in 10 said employers should be told 
the survey of 1084 adults was done in advance of the fifth 
international conference on aids which opened sunday in montreal 
it found the disease has touched the lives of a sizable minority of 
americans nearly one in five said they personally know someone who 
is infected with aids or who has died of it 
most felt they were at no risk personally of getting aids and 
respondents were split on whether aids is likely to spread widely 
outside known risk groups homosexuals and intravenous drug 
abusers and their sexual partners 
still majorities said they would pay higher taxes for aids 
research and treatment nearly all favored aids education in the 
schools and 81 percent said pupils should be told that using 
condoms can prevent aids infection 
the poll also found growing social acceptance of aids patients 
threequarters said people with aids should be entitled to keep 
their jobs and nearly eight in 10 said children who have aids 
should be admitted to school twice as many as held that view in 
polls four years ago 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer aids is spread most often through sexual 
contact tainted hypodermic needles and infected blood and from 
pregnant women to their offspring an estimated 5 million people 
worldwide are infected and no cure is known 
fiftytwo percent in the poll thought aids was likely to spread 
widely beyond current risk groups at the same time just 11 
percent thought they were at great risk or some risk of getting 
aids 23 percent felt not much risk and 64 percent said no 
risk at all two percent were unsure 
of those who thought they could get aids three in 10 said they 
have changed their sexual behavior to lessen the odds 
half overall favored passage of a federal law prohibiting 
discrimination against people with aids other federal efforts won 
favor six in 10 said they would pay higher taxes for government 
spending on aids research and 56 percent said would accept a tax 
increase for treatment of aids patients 
eight in 10 said the government should allow aids patients to 
take experimental drugs that have not been fully tested and 
approved as safe and half favored giving free sterilized needles 
to drug abusers if such a move would curb aids 
in most gauges people ages 18 to 44 supported antiaids efforts 
in greater numbers than did their elders more educated respondents 
also were more apt to favor antiaids programs and to accept aids 
patients at work and school 
finally 55 percent said they would agree to answer detailed 
questions about their sexual behavior for a confidential federal 
study the public health service had hoped to study the spread of 
aids by asking thousands of americans such questions but the 
survey is being rewritten at the behest of conservative congressmen 
who objected to its contents 
the poll conducted may 513 had a 3point margin of error

iraqis who held ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini responsible for the iraniraq war on sunday cheered the 
news of his death and expressed hope iran now will sign a peace 
treaty to end the war 
were not rejoicing for his death but for the 10yearold 
nightmare that is now over said abdul karim subhi 45 a 
schoolteacher 
like him many iraqis considered khomeini the main obstacle in 
peace talks that have been deadlocked almost since the start of an 
aug 20 ceasefire that halted fighting in the war 
western analysts estimate that 1 million people were killed in 
the war which began in september 1980 the year after khomeini 
came to power 
khomeini 86 died saturday in a hospital in tehran many iraqis 
who lost family members in the war shouted for joy when baghdad 
radio reported the news sunday morning 
the state radio cut into its normal programs to broadcast cheery 
songs in arabic but there was no official comment from the 
government which provided refuge to khomeini part of the time he 
lived in exile 
the imposter has perished yelled um khalil a 63yearold 
woman whose son died in the war 
to hell with him she repeated over and over as she ran 
around banging on neighbors doors to tell them the news other 
families telephoned each other to break the news 
iraqis have long blamed khomeini for keeping the war going even 
after iraq offered peace in 1985 khomeini did not agree to the 
unmediated ceasefire until july after a series of battlefield 
disasters and a year after iraq agreed to the ceasefire 
iraq invaded iran on sept 20 1988 but the iraqis claim iran 
had started the war weeks earlier by shelling border areas after 
months of agitation and subversion 
iraqs leaders have said that feuding among rival politicians in 
iran has stalled the peace talks 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
doubted khomeinis death would have any immediate effect on the 
talks 
it will take the iranian leaders at least a few months to 
settle their internal struggle before they can discuss the peace 
talks one said 
khomeini lived in the shiite moslem holy city of najaf 100 
miles south of baghdad for about 15 years after he was exiled from 
iran by the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi in 1964 
but president saddam hussein at the request of the shah 
ordered khomeini out of iraq in 1978 
khomeini was bitter toward saddam after that and the hostility 
was seen as one factor in his repeated refusal to end the war 
although most of iraqs 16 million people are shiite like the 
overwhelming majority of iranians they rejected khomeinis 
repeated calls to rise up against saddam a sunni moslem 
iraqs official media gave prominent coverage to khomeinis 
illness 
news of khomeinis death came too late for sundays editions of 
iraqi newspapers 
but the althawra daily the newspaper of the ruling baath 
socialist party reported in a frontpage headline sunday 
khomeini is on the brink of his grave

he was a reclusive frail dourfaced clergyman a monkish 
moslem little versed in the affairs of state but ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini toppled a king stunned a superpower and shook 
the world with his message of moslem piety and might 
tehran radio reported early sunday that khomeini died in a 
hospital in the iranian capital 12 days after undergoing surgery 
for intenstinal bleeding he was 86 
through years of war and internal turmoil the iranian leaders 
magnetism held his countrys islamic revolution together 
as the absolute guide of irans 10yearold revolutionary 
government he condoned the seizure of 52 us embassy hostages in 
tehran waged war on iraq and blessed the executions of tens of 
thousands of iranians dissidents and sinners prostitutes drug 
dealers and users adulterers and other violators of the islamic 
code 
god preserve khomeini until the return of the 12th imam 
pleaded a banner in tehran referring to the promised messiah of 
irans shiite moslem religion of whom khomeini was held to be 
representative on earth 
khomeinis enemies predicted the islamic revolutionary 
government would die with him 
the regimes existing contradictions will lose their sole axis 
of unity and be raised to the explosive level said one 
antikhomeini group 
khomeini and his followers labored to make irans unique brand 
of religious rule permanent 
we may have different viewpoints but we must all keep 
together khomeini told the iranian cabinet in october 1985 
but in march 1989 khomeini dumped the man chosen by the 
83member assembly of experts as his successor in 1985 ayatollah 
husseinali montazeri leaving the field open to rival candidates 
or a collective leadership 
as the exiled voice of opposition to shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
khomeini spurred iranians into months of street protests and 
strikes that in february 1979 finally ended 2500 years of monarchy 
in power khomeini looked beyond irans borders full of zeal to 
convert other lands to his brand of religious fundamentalism and 
mobilize islam into a powerful world force 
we should awaken the people of the world if we want to 
export the revolution he declared in a speech in october 1981 
he was an unlikely leader often ailing quietspoken appearing 
infrequently in public after a heart attack in february 1980 he 
moved into a house in the northern tehran suburb of jamaran where 
groups of admirers often sat in a courtyard while he waved at them 
silently from a balcony 
last month he underwent surgery for bleeding in his digestive 
tract after the operation doctors pronounced him in good shape for 
his age 
until the end of the iraniraq war khomeini spoke frequently on 
the radio after that his statements were read for him often by 
his politically ambitious son ahmad 
he spoke of the need for unity and for becoming more islamic 
appealing to a deep chord among the iranian masses the khomeini 
face white beard dark eyes glaring out from beneath bushy brows 
and black turban glowered from posters billboards and banners 
across iran 
the ascetic ayatollah extolled selfdenial and the simple values 
of traditional islamic life he inveighed against the 
westernization and corruption of the pahlavi years and demanded 
that women return to the old headtofoot chador veil 
he railed against the worlddevouring governments the 
united states and soviet union that sought influence over iran 
the ayatollah is of the opinion that islam is a religion 
embracing all aspects of human life an official iranian 
biography said of him 
the drive to create a purely islamic state fired the imagination 
of fundamentalists throughout the moslem world especially among 
shiites often an impoverished minority in moslem nations 
this worried irans arab neighbors many ruled by 
westernaligned monarchs or radical secular autocrats and dominated 
by the less stern sunni moslem sect 
fear of khomeinist efforts at subversion was one reason 
iraqi president saddam hussein invaded iran in september 1980 
the outside world knew little of khomeini until the uprising 
against the shah in 1978 but for iranians he had been a symbol of 
the antipahlavi movement for decades 
according to his brother he was born sept 23 1902 in the 
village of khomein 140 miles southwest of tehran he was the son 
of the local religious leader ayatollah sayed mustafa musavi 
the official biography says his mother was the daughter of 
another ayatollah the highest shiite moslem religious title 
meaning verses of allah 
his father was killed at age 42 by some wicked men the 
biography says and from the age of 5 months khomeini was reared 
by his mother and aunt 
he received a traditional moslem seminary education entirely 
restricted to islamic studies and in the late 1920s began teaching 
in qom center of shiite teaching in iran attracting attention for 
his independent views 
according to his brother at the age of 27 khomeini married 
khadijeh the 16yearold daughter of a clergyman and had two sons 
and three daughters 
he reportedly took the name khomeini from his home village 
after his brother also an ayatollah was arrested for politcal 
activities in 1930 
during the 1930s khomeini spoke out against the efforts of the 
monarch reza shah father of mohammad reza pahlavi to reduce the 
role of the clergy in everyday iranian life in 1941 he published 
an essay denouncing the monarchs modernizing policies and foreign 
at that time british domination of iran 
later that year the world war ii allies occupied iran and 
forced reza shah to abdicate in favor of his 21yearold son 
although khomeini regarded the son with the same distrust as the 
father the anticommunist khomeini distanced himself from the 
leftistnationalist movement of mohammad mossadeq which briefly 
ousted the young shah from power in 1953 
by 1963 however when pahlavi initiated a series of 
westernizing measures khomeini had become the most powerful voice 
in opposition 
the shah is selling iran to foreigners islam is in peril 
he claimed in a sermon in qom that led to rioting in which 
hundreds perhaps thousands of people were killed by government 
forces 
the outspoken ayatollah was arrested shortly after the rioting 
and according to his supporters imprisoned in a sweltering cell 
where he developed breathing problems in november 1964 he was 
sent into exile first to turkey then to iraq where he settled in 
the shiite shrine city of najaf 
in exile the brooding clergyman kept his links with followers 
in iran 
our one and only remedy is to bring down those corrupt and 
corrupting systems of government he wrote 
iran meanwhile was being transformed by a flood of oil 
dollars the urban population swelled universities expanded more 
western ways were introduced corruption spread within the iranian 
elite dissent was harshly suppressed 
by 1978 antimonarchist sentiment was rising quickly 
especially among lowerclass city dwellers frozen out of irans 
new wealth and unemployed young graduates overeducated for jobs 
that did not exist

it exploded in january 1978 after a tehran newspaper printed an 
antikhomeini letter reportedly instigated by the information 
minister and the ayatollahs supporters took to the streets 
government forces crushed the demonstrations 
khomeini from his distant sanctuary emerged as the moral focus 
of a burgeoning revolution and irans 150000 shiite clergymen and 
their network of mosques were the organizational structure 
the shah his rule threatened had khomeini expelled from 
neighboring iraq the ayatollah and his close advisers settled in 
france in october 1978 his four months there formed his only 
experience outside the middle east 
from a paris suburb khomeini sent his political message into 
iran through thousands of cassette recordings and the modern 
telephone system the shah had installed to link iran with europe 
in tehran the cycle of protest and strike built to a bloody 
crescendo and on jan 16 1979 pahlavi fled the country on feb 
1 after more than 14 years in exile khomeini returned to his 
homeland amid the adulation of millions the shahs last government 
collapsed 10 days later 
but the revolution was far from finished bloodletting far worse 
than anything seen in the struggle against the shah loomed as the 
revolution like others before it began to devour its children 
in march 1979 iranians voted overwhelmingly for an islamic 
republic its constitution made shiite islam the state religion 
gave a council of clergymen veto power over legislation and 
enshrined khomeini as supreme leader for life 
leftists liberals westerntrained technocrats and others 
resisted the clergys attempts to rule solely by the koran the 
islamic holy book even some highranking clergymen disputed 
khomeinis claims to power the grand coalition that overthrew the 
shah began to fall apart 
then on nov 4 1979 iranian militants describing themselves 
as followers of the imams line seized the us embassy and 
hostages in tehran the showdown with the united states which 
khomeini described as a war between the moslems and the pagans 
heightened tensions between hardliners and moderates in iran 
within days the revolutions first prime minister 
westerneducated mehdi bazargan resigned by the time the 52 
hostages were finally released in january 1981 the hardliners had 
won 
the power struggle climaxed five months later when president 
abolhassan banisadr a layman economist open to compromise with 
the outside world was fired by khomeini and fled into exile 
opposition to the theocracy grew bloodier the leftist 
underground mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors embarked 
on an assassination and bombing campaign that killed thousands of 
revolutionary officials and security men the khomeini regime 
responded with mass arrests and executions 
the confirmed toll of executions reached 6108 by 1985 
including former officials of the old regime dissident 
revolutionaries members of the bahai religious sect and sex and 
drug offenders 
but the human rights group amnesty international said the actual 
total must have been considerably higher the mujahedeen khalq 
claimed 40000 people had been executed 
a new wave of executions killed hundreds and perhaps thousands 
in 1988 and 1989 during maneuvering for postkhomeini power 
in the war with iraq meanwhile khomeini for eight years 
demanded the ouster and trial of iraqi president hussein as a 
condition for peace 
by 1982 iranian forces had driven the invaders back into iraq 
and later iranians conquered some iraqi territory but at a terrible 
cost us officials estimated at least a halfmillion iranians 
were killed or wounded in the war 
the war ended with a ceasefire in august 1988 after a series of 
iraqi victories drove the iranians from iraqi territory 
khomeini said acceptance of the ceasefire is more deadly to 
me than poison but that it was the will of god and the 
recommendation of his political and military advisers 
because of the war revolutionary turmoil and mismanagement 
iranians endured economic hardship under khomeini food staples and 
other essentials were rationed and possibly onethird of irans 
workers were jobless 
the hardship and turmoil was a fertile field for potential 
successors to till particularly after khomeini dumped his 
designated successor montazeri a leading contender was hashemi 
rafsanjani the parliament speaker and since june 1988 acting 
commanderinchief credited with bringing iran to the ceasefire 
but the ayatollah was a deft politician sitting on top of it 
all balancing factions off against each other said one us 
official 
his death sentence against british author salman rushdie in 
february 1989 for rushdies harsh antiislamic satire in the novel 
the satanic verses was seen as a move to counter a moderate 
trend among iranian leaders who wanted to normalize relations with 
the west 
khomeini continued the effort to institutionalize the islamic 
revolution naming in april 1989 a 20man committee to revise the 
constitution and ensure a strong leadership system 
the iranian leader usually sounded uncompromising but he could 
be thoroughly pragmatic 
according to need i say one thing today that i contradict 
tomorrow banisadr a longtime khomeini protege once quoted 
khomeini as saying 
his daughter zahra head of the iranian womens association 
said khomeini was absorbed in the koran the moslem holy book and 
affairs of state from morning until night even taking the radio to 
the bathroom with him 
his selfdiscipline is unbelievable she said in a talk to 
pupils reported by a tehran paper

welcome to texas where men are men and 
women are mayors 
when suzie azar is sworn in june 12 as el paso mayor women will 
lead texas four largest cities the three largest already have 
women mayors kathy whitmire in houston annette strauss in dallas 
and lila cockrell in san antonio who took office thursday 
regaining the post she held from 1975 to 1981 
they say womens advancement in politics is bringing nearer the 
day when voters wont give a candidates gender a second thought 
i think its good now that a woman being elected mayor is not 
a novelty and that women can do the job and are accepted as such 
said ms whitmire who also is president of the texas municipal 
league and presidentelect of the us conference of mayors 
in dallas houston and san antonio the mayors job is 
considered parttime and much power rests with the fulltime city 
managers but the mayors still have a strong role in leading the 
city council and lobbying business and political leaders in el 
paso the mayor has more power because there is not a city manager 
ann fears crawford author of women in texas a 1982 book 
about female politicians said the idea of female mayors in texas 
is not whats new 
its not a sudden spate of women she said weve had them 
since the 60s especially in small towns 
what youre just seeing now is them working up to metropolitan 
areas 
women are mayors of 12 of the 100 largest cities in the united 
states according to the center for american women and politics at 
rutgers university and five of those 12 are in texas betty turner 
is mayor of corpus christi the nations 58thlargest city 
women have a reputation of caring more about social and 
compassion issues said sue tolleson rinehart associate 
professor of political science at texas tech in local politics 
thats what you tend to be thinking about 
but if texas voters are willing to send women to city hall they 
havent yet been willing to send them to many higher offices of 
the 181 seats in the state legislature only 19 are held by women 
treasurer ann richards is the only woman in a statewide elected 
office and the states 29member congressional delegation is all 
male 
it is true that women are making slightly more progress at the 
municipal level but not a lot more said ms whitmire 
the chairmen of the texas democratic and republican parties said 
they believe women are working their way up in state politics 
its a lot like anything else state gop chairman fred meyer 
said you have to work your way up the ranks 
you dont just run for congress you have to be on the school 
board be on city council be a mayor be a state representative 
you have to be something first because its not a job for 
amateurs 
bob slagle chairman of the texas democratic party said he 
believes there is a relationship between womens rise in business 
and politics 
women are demonstrating they are capable in the corporate and 
political worlds slagle said you get away from a lot of the 
myths that women are different from men and cant handle making 
decisions and running things 
ms whitmire said women are more likely to rise faster in 
politics than in business because voters tend to be more 
openminded than corporate executives 
the next logical step for women in texas politics would be to 
have a female governor the first since miriam a ma ferguson 
was elected in 1924 as a puppet candidate for her husband 
impeached exgov james ferguson 
ms richards who gained national attention last year as the 
keynote speaker at the democratic national convention is expected 
to run for governor next year ms rinehart said the treasurers 
reputation for toughness is deserved 
the texas political culture has had the reputation of being so 
hard on women that the ones who do survive tend to be superwomen 
she said

robert reid now ap chief of bureau in the 
philippines covered ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis return to iran 
and his rise to power in 1979 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
return from exile in 1979 thousands would jam the narrow 
mudwalled streets near his tehran headquarters for a daily 
blessing usually they were rewarded with little more than a wave 
khomeinis charisma was based neither on fiery rhetoric nor 
grandiose gestures it was his singleminded will that galvanized 
iranian discontent and toppled his usbacked adversary shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi 
in a society that idealizes the bazaar merchant a haggler and 
a compromiser khomeini who died saturday at age 86 did not 
haggle or compromise 
his dour stony face never displayed the doubts and inner 
turmoil that plague many people of power he rarely smiled during 
public appearances once he allowed a halfgrin when one of his 
grandsons was brought to him 
during the turbulent days of the iranian revolution khomeinis 
message remained simple the shah must go none of the compromises 
offered during the chaotic days of january 1979 would satisfy him 
the shah pressured by mounting street demonstrations left the 
country on vacation on jan 16 1979 after appointing 
liberalminded shahpour bakhtiar prime minister bakhtiar offered 
to go to france to escort khomeini home but the ayatollah refused 
when khomeini returned to iran on feb 1 1979 the government 
issued a conciliatory statement of welcome and acknowledged him as 
the nations spiritual leader 
khomeini traveled to a cemetery south of tehran and announced 
immediately that bakhtiar too must go 
during the speech the frail khomeini had to be lifted onto a 
makeshift podium to address the tens of thousands gathered there 
the public address system failed except for reporters huddled 
beneath the podium few could hear his words delivered in a firm 
but quiet mumble 
still the crowd roared in support and rushed forward 
enthusiastically as khomeinis helicopter lifted off 
within two weeks the government collapsed and bakhtiar was in 
hiding later he escaped to france 
khomeini often seemed oblivious to the challenge of his enemies 
as if they were powerless in the face of islam 
soon after returning khomeini assembled the international press 
and announced the appointment of his own prime minister oil 
engineer mehdi bazargan never mind that bakhtiar still officially 
held the post 
bazargan was visibly nervous during the news conference 
perhaps he was mindful of his role in such a monumental display 
of treason or perhaps he had discovered what the assembled 
reporters already knew that his trousers were unzipped 
but khomeini sat calmly on bazargans right in sublime peace

toxic smoke from a fire in the womens wing 
of a prison killed 10 people and injured about 40 officials said 
sunday 
the blaze at the maximumsecurity prison began just before 
midnight saturday in a pile of mattresses that investigators said 
contained a petroleum resin that produces a toxic acrid smoke when 
burned 
police spokesman piero sassi said guards and prison firefighters 
responded quickly but could not save eight female inmates and two 
women guards who died of smoke inhalation in the first minutes of 
the blaze 
investigators said they believed the fire began accidently but 
authorities appointed a commission of inquiry that began its 
investigation sunday 
the mattresses were stored on a thirdfloor porch under the 
windows of some of the cells investigators said the inmates often 
light matches and wave them from their windows to signal male 
inmates in another prison section they said the fire may have 
started when a match was dropped from a window 
smoke from the fire quickly entered the cells through the 
windows left open because it was a warm night officials said 
the italian news agency ansa said most of the injured were 
treated for smoke inhalation and released sunday but that two women 
were in a coma

lebanons civil war

they were the first shelling casualties since may 11 when the 
arab league called a ceasefire to halt nine weeks of fierce 
artillery duels at least 360 people have died and 1410 have been 
wounded since fighting broke out march 8 between gen michel aouns

the command of the 40000 syrian troops stationed in lebanon 
under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate declined comment on aouns charge 
it was the first time both sides had shelled residential 
districts since the arab league ceasefire was called 
whether its just a message to the arab summit troika or the 
beginning of an allout new shelling round remains to be seen

with federal judges seeking a 30 percent pay 
raise the associated press conducted a computeraided analysis of 
the incomes and assets of the entire federal judiciary 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the majority of americas federal judges have 
sixfigure investment portfolios and many make more money off the 
bench than on according to a comprehensive study of their 
government financial reports 
the judges whose current salaries range from 89500 to 
115000 a year are now pressing congress for a 30 percent salary 
increase 
i think judges are entitled to a pay raise said robert 
mcwilliams of the us 10th circuit court in colorado they are 
worth it judges salaries rather than being geared to the income 
of the average taxpayer should be geared to the average of 
practicing lawyers 
an associated press survey of 935 financial disclosure reports 
found that few federal jurists depend solely on their salaries all 
but 15 of the judges had outside income with more than half the 
judges reporting extra earnings in a range from 16624 to 39500 
for its study ap examined reports for 1987 the most recent 
year for which a complete set was available most material in these 
reports is listed within wide numerical ranges rather than in exact 
dollar amounts 
like other americans with personal assets the judges receive 
investment income through interest dividends rent on real estate 
and capital gains on land or securities four hundred judges 
reported extra earned income some through teaching law speaking 
fees or book royalties but mostly through pensions from earlier 
jobs or settlements from their former law firms 
if i didnt have some farm and timberland that my father left 
me i doubt if i would be so sure that i will spend the rest of my 
career on the bench judge duross fitzpatrick said in a letter 
used to support the proposal for a 51 percent pay increase that was 
defeated by congress in february 
according to his disclosure report fitzpatricks outside income 
may have exceeded his 89500 salary the macon ga jurist 
reported net investment assets between 472388 and 865379 and 
said he collected between 75510 and 165100 in outside income in 
1987 
for 10 years financial disclosure forms have been required of 
federal officials focusing considerable attention on congress and 
the cabinet the judges in contrast have received less scrutiny 
some details from the judicial disclosures 
only five judges reported no household income other than 
salaries 
at least 555 judges perhaps as many as 723 have investment 
assets worth more than 100000 after their debts have been 
subtracted the typical judge reported net investments worth 
between 140000 and 350000 these assets generally reflect 
family funds or substantial incomes before and after appointment to 
the bench 
at least 62 and as many as 176 of the judges are 
millionaires they include gerhard gesell who presided over the 
trial of oliver north and whose holdings include stock and a 
358acre virginia farm sandra day oconnor appears to be the only 
millionaire on the supreme court 
many of the judges at least 93 and perhaps as many as 258 
have more money coming in from outside sources than they get from 
their government salaries 
judicial leaders right up to chief justice william rehnquist 
say the judges are underpaid and their salaries indeed lag behind 
americas top corporate attorneys yet in comparison to most 
americans or even to most american attorneys the judges find 
themselves in comfortable circumstances 
the median us wage and salary earner was paid 14733 in 1987 
at least 507 of the judges made more than that off the bench a 
median means half are above that figure and half are below 
to look at the point raised by mcwilliams median income for all 
of americas 707000 lawyers and judges was 45069 according to 
census reports at least 207 and as many as 426 of the federal 
judges made more than that outside the courtroom 
the disclosure reports put the median 1987 income for a federal 
judge at between 108018 and 130300 
myron bright a semiretired appeals judge in fargo nd 
receives a 95000 judicial salary and made more than 43530 from 
teaching and speaking in 1987 his total income was more than the 
combined salaries of north dakotas chief justice and attorney 
general 
personal finance isnt the lure for many of the attorneys who 
accept a lifetime appointment as judge on an actual income 
basis i think im making less than i did when i first got on the 
bench said the 70yearold bright but im not complaining 
being a federal judge is like getting the brass ring on a 
merrygoround said avern cohn of michigan a onetime prominent 
lawyer who is among the wealthiest judges in the country i was 
looking for other ways to prove myself professionally 
americas most impoverished judge is alcee hastings of miami 
who is now fighting a perjury impeachment by congress hastings had 
legal bills between 450000 and 1 million in 1987 and reported he 
was at least 699005 in the red 
more representative of judges who report themselves in debt is 
thomas mcavoy of binghamton ny who reported debts that exceed 
his assets by 83797 to 194500 the bulk of mcavoys holdings 
are in mortgaged real estate 
richard cudahy of chicago scion of a milwaukee meatpacking 
family may be the wealthiest judge the 63yearold appellate 
jurist is worth between 84 million and 161 million 
overall the financial reports do not give a complete look at 
the judges wealth because they do not include their homes and 
holdings not held for investment purposes also judges can value 
property at the purchase price sometimes decades out of date 
in addition the ap understated the wealth by not counting 
assets and income of spouses and dependent children except where 
specifically noted 
earlier this year congress balked at a 51 percent raise 
proposed for judges congress and some executives chief justice 
rehnquist then held a rare news conference to appeal for raises to 
avert what he called the most serious threat to the future of the 
judiciary rehnquist reports the net value of his investments 
between 71000 and 230000 
president bush responded by proposing 25 percent increases for 
the judges with some limits on outside income the judges are 
asking for 30 percent with annual costofliving adjustments and no 
limits 
the judges say an inflationdriven financial squeeze will force 
many of them from the bench and into higherpaying jobs at law 
firms this assumes they in fact would land the relatively rare 
higher paying jobs 
a survey by the american lawyer magazine found that 1987 profits 
per partner in the 100 firms with the most revenue ranged from 
155000 to 14 million their 10098 partners concentrated 
primarily in a handful of big cities represent 15 percent of all 
the lawyers in america

like members of congress and highranking 
federal executive officials federal judges are required to file 
annual statements of what they bought sold earned owned or owed 
during the year 
the associated press transferred the data for a complete year of 
judges forms 1987 onto computers for analysis more than 20000 
pieces of data were included 
the reporting rules contained in the ethics in government act of 
1978 blur the actual value of the investments and income being 
disclosed most entries are reported within wide numerical ranges 
rather than in exact dollar amounts 
the forms understate assets by exempting some from disclosure 
including 
any home which is the largest asset for most americans 
any bank account under 5000 
any asset under 1000 
any car or personal property 
any property not held for investment purposes or to produce 
income 
in addition property can be valued at cost which is often 
decades out of date 
liabilities exempt from reporting include home mortgages debts 
to relatives and revolving charge accounts with balances below 
10000 
for example a rental property worth 90000 and generating 
rental income of 10144 a year would be listed as being worth 
n and the income would be l n stands for 50001 to 
100000 and l is 5001 to 15000 
as the number of items handled this way increases the overall 
precision of the forms decreases 
it is least precise at the high end of the ranges which stop at 
over 250000 for assets and over 100000 for income a 
10 million property would be valued as p which simply 
signifies more than 250000 if it brought in income of 1 million 
annually that would be listed as h more than 100000 
net worth cannot be calculated from these forms instead the 
forms provide data to calculate a net value for an officials 
investment portfolio by subtracting reported liabilities from 
reported assets 
the process can be confusing even to judges a handful of whom 
attached complaining notes to their forms in some cases where the 
form was filled out wrong but the intent was clear minor 
interpretation was used by the ap in summarizing a judges 
finances in cases where more than one interpretation was possible 
the finances were recorded exactly as shown on the form 
the reports examined by the ap were filed in 1988 and cover the 
judges finances for 1987 that is the most recent complete set 
reports are required of all judges who work at least 60 days during 
a calendar year between 17 percent and 20 percent of senior judges 
do not work that much 
some of the judges filing then have since retired some are 
living elsewhere and a few have died other judges have since gone 
onto the bench but their finances are not part of this study 
because they were not required to file for that year

they call it crossing the line or going 
south and its the most agonizing task the drug enforcement 
administration faces investigating agents who succumb to the lure 
of drug money 
since march three agents from the miami office the deas 
largest with 350 agents have been charged with protecting the drug 
traffickers they were supposed to be throwing in jail 
they join three others convicted here since the early 1980s of 
aiding or supplying information to drug smugglers in return for 
hundreds of thousands of dollars 
but that doesnt mean the medellin cartel has somehow penetrated 
the deas topsecret operations says john fernandes a dea 
spokesman here 
i dont know of any agents who were killed or any major 
investigations compromised by these cases he said these were 
all isolated incidents 
most dea officials are reluctant to talk about cleaning their 
own house the deas washington headquarters failed to respond to 
repeated requests by the associated press for the number of agents 
arrested nationally on charges of drug involvement 
but tom cash special agent in charge of the miami office 
confronts the issue headon 
this is elephantland for cocaine he said last year we 
seized 178 million in cash and property and 40 percent of that 
was green 
cash pulled a photo from his office wall of agents posing with a 
19 million cash haul and pointed to individually wrapped packets 
of 100 bills 
each one of those is 10000 cash says the agent thinks 
suppose i put two or three of these in my pocket whos going to 
know the difference 
a spokesman for the federal office of national drug control 
policy in washington says corruption in the dea while considered 
lowlevel is a cause for concern 
its a problem were aware of and will be looking into said 
larry cirignano spokesman for director william j bennett the 
problem is money at some point everybody comes to a price even 
though you hope they dont 
because of the huge amounts of cash agents deal with and the 
necessity of working undercover with informants who themselves 
actively engage in trafficking the dea is the nations most 
tempted lawenforcement agency cash said 
in response the dea has an unforgiving policy to combat the 
linecrossers and those who allow confidential information to go 
south to traffickers as the agents say 
we dont sweep these cases under the rug cash said and 
we do not just fire people for violations of law we prosecute 
them 
in addition the dea has a tight system to finger an agent who 
wanders from standard procedures 
agents generally work in groups of about a dozen and anyone who 
displays too much interest in a case outside his jurisdiction 
immediately comes under scrutiny 
the dea keeps track of every request for its computerized files 
and can later crosscheck for suspicious activity if it appears 
traffickers know too much there are about 2 million files in the 
national computer system in miami the agency is currently 
investigating 3000 cases and using about 500 informants 
when operating in the field confiscated cash and drugs must be 
counted by at least two agents whenever possible agents avoid 
counting cash at all and just bundle it up and send it to a bank 
because of the slippery nature of dealings with informants no 
agent is supposed to meet an informant alone 
all agents including cash himself must take a monthly drug 
test failure means immediate dismissal 
and every complaint against an agent no matter what its source 
or how dubious is investigated cash said 
no check would ever be so thorough as when it involves a dea 
agent cash says we would spend our whole budget on it if 
necessary 
cash has developed a surprising theory on which agents are most 
likely to cross the line 
its not the average special agent who is involved in these 
types of incidents its the very best most of them were 
problemfree he said theyre the ones who are working 
undercover running up against the very best on the other side 
after a while they believe they know the system and can beat 
it he said 
the recent miami cases bear him out all involved agents had at 
least nine years of experience in the agency 
jorge villar who worked with metrodade police before joining 
dea 11 years ago was arrested in march for allegedly agreeing to 
accept 300000 to protect a cocaine shipment from the bahamas 
arrested together last month were agents drew bunnell and al 
iglesias who were accused of wanting 100000 from an informant to 
help him hide a cocaine ripoff by disguising it as a bust bunnell 
had nine years with the dea and iglesias 14

this birthplace and gravesite of smokey 
bear has become a shrine to fire prevention and residents admit 
their town would be just a dot on the map without the singed cub 
that grew into a worldwide symbol 
the symbol is more important than ever with fire danger in 
nearby forests at an alltime high said steve makowski fire 
management officer for the smokey bear ranger district of the 
lincoln national forest 
we are in the worst conditions ever seen here said makowski 
even worse than 1950 when a 17000acre fire left the tiny 
terrified motherless bear cub clinging to the trunk of a 
smoldering tree in the capitan gap northeast of town 
after firefighters cleaned up the cub and veterinarians treated 
his fireblistered paws and singed tail they named him smokey and 
started him on a new life that included 26 years in the national 
zoo in washington dc he became the embodiment of the symbol 
created in 1944 by the us forest service to encourage fire 
prevention 
when the 400pound bear died in 1976 at the age of 26 thats 
10 years longer than the average bear lives the body was brought 
back to capitan for burial 
this town of 1200 is built around smokey theres the smokey 
bear motel the smokey bear restaurant the smokey bear museum run 
by the village and smokey bear state park the smokey bear 
stampede will be held july 14 
last year 42000 people visited capitan and the small logcabin 
museum the townspeople built themselves with donated funds inside 
are smokey hats puzzles bookmarks bells tshirts and other 
memorabilia the walls are lined with pictures of the little cub 
and the grownup bear 
the museum and state park share a fouracre plot that includes 
trails native plants a playground and a tennis court and of 
course smokeys grave beneath an imposing boulder capped with a 
bronze marker 
a few years back a team of 48 indian firefighters from utah and 
arizona stopped here after battling a blaze in southern new mexico 
they said they never thought theyd get to see smokeys 
grave said willie hobbs curator of the village museum they 
stood in line they were so happy to get to the place where smokey 
the bear was found 
visitors come from all over the world said chamber of commerce 
president dick beck its one of the few things weve got here as 
far as tourism he added 
but makowski says smokey retains a much more serious meaning 
fire departments from around the world write to the smokey bear 
fire prevention district seeking advice on setting up smokey bear 
programs and at least 20 countries now have such programs he said 
i think smokeys been an extremely effective program 
makowski said 
back at the national zoo in washington smokey junior lives on 
hes an adopted son of the original smokey who had no 
offspring according to zoo spokesman dan gifford

the secretary of the calhoun county 
historical society did a double take as he entered city hall on his 
way to a meeting there among 100 years worth of portraits of 
anniston mayors was a face hed seen before 
it took robert lindley and city officials a while to sort out 
why a picture of the rev charles w freeland rector of the church 
of st michael and all saints was hanging there the rector was 
identified as th hopkins mayor from 188185 
lindley said he recognized freeland while at city hall earlier 
this year from pictures hanging at the episcopal church 
freeland kind of has that look of someone who would be in 
charge or important lindley said explaining how the mistake 
could happen 
when lindley notified city officials they noticed the man in 
the picture has a cross on a chain around his neck and if you 
look real close you can see the clerical collar he said 
jim johnson of lance johnson studios who painted the former 
mayors portraits from old photographs said a mislabled old print 
of freelands picture must have gotten mixed up with those of the 
mayors 
years ago johnsons father bought russell bros annistons 
first portrait photographers he said and that apparently was the 
source of freelands picture 
freelands portrait was removed last week from pictorial 
association with the mayors and the congregation of st michaels 
is interested in getting it back abby ulrey church office 
administrator said 
meanwhile johnson is attempting to locate a print of hopkins 
for a new portrait to fill the empty wall space 
but city employees will miss the familiar face of freeland 
aka hopkins personnel clerk marguerite bright said 
he looked like someone youd want for an ancestor she said

dorothy terry either 57 years or 12 days to earn her high school 
diploma 
mrs terry who left school at the age of 13 and will turn 70 
next month needed only six weeks of study two days a week to 
get her general educational development diploma 
i dont know why i let so many years go by the covington 
resident told her fellow graduates during a ceremony last week 
we all have the same reasons more or less busy no time 
suddenly i felt a thirst for knowledge the opportunity was 
all around me and all i had to do was go for it 
in 1932 mrs terry dropped out of school in new orleans to 
learn how to sew four years later she was married and dreams 
about resuming her education were forgotten 
we never had the things they have now washers dryers 
dishwashers she said when i got married that was the end of 
my life once you get married your life is over you cant go to 
school any anymore i had to raise four children 
now a greatgrandmother she works at a daycare center and she 
plans to stay in school studying music and computer science at 
southeastern louisiana university in hammond 
it keeps you from getting older as long as you use this 
she said tapping her forehead you keep it moving you find when 
you read and do math it keeps you younger

a man who says he holds the world 
record for rides on a single roller coaster has taken his 8000th 
trip on the racer at the kings island amusement park 
don helbig 26 of cincinnati threw his hands high as he went up 
and down on the ride the thrill keeps getting better and i 
dont plan to stop until i hit 10000 he said friday 
helbig who manages a sporting goods store in suburban 
cincinnati said he hopes to reach his goal in 1990 
he took his 7000th ride on the racer in august 1987 kings 
island officials say an organization called the american coaster 
enthusiasts has verified that helbigs ride total on the racer is a 
record for riding one attraction 
he began riding on the roller coaster in 1981 while he was 
seasonally employed by the cincinnati reds he stepped up his ride 
pace during a strike by majorleague baseball players that year 
which gave him more free time 
in 1982 one train of the racer was turned around to operate in 
the backward direction helbig says he has ridden the coaster 4800 
times in the forward direction and 3200 times backward he took 
his 8000th ride facing forward

here is a list of the 935 federal judges whose 
financial disclosure statements were examined by the associated 
press 
the list gives each judges court and arange that approximates 
the dollar amount of the net value of his investments 
it should be noted that some of the judges appear to be in debt 
when that may not be true this is because the government reporting 
system understates assets and can overstate liabilities 
the figures on this list were computed by subtracting the range 
for a judges debts from the range for his investments this 
occasionally produces a transposed range for disclosed net 
investment portfolio because the ranges for debts and assets may be 
in varying sizes 
in some cases where the judges form was filled out incorrectly 
but the intent was clear minor interpretation was used by the ap 
in summarizing a judges finances in other cases where more than 
one interpretation was possible finances were recorded exactly as 
they were on the form

a small but innovative agency within the 
pentagons star wars missile defense effort faces a second year of 
reduced funding forcing a slowdown in research projects ranging 
from optical computers to highpower microwave weapons 
the agency the office of innovative science and technology 
served as a lightning rod for criticism of the strategic defense 
initiative shortly after it was launched several years ago ists 
activities continue to draw both criticism and qualified support 
within the american civilian scientific community 
ist funding peaked at 106 million in fiscal 1988 but was cut to 
76 million this fiscal year tentative plans call for a slight 
increase to 80 million in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
if that plan holds ist director dwight duston said well 
probably have to make some severe decisions its going to 
certainly dampen the program 
we have some things which are ready to really accelerate now 
in other words weve got some seed corn sprouting and its ready 
to go if we have to be held at 80 million therell be no 
fertilizer this coming year things will have to percolate along at 
the very fiscally limited level they are now he said 
duston said he was told his agencys spending was being 
virtually frozen because of competing priorities and overall fiscal 
constraints 
for the entire sdi program the bush administration has 
requested 46 billion in fiscal 1990 up from 41 billion this 
fiscal year but considerably below the 59 billion recommended by 
president reagan before he left office 
critics of ist contend it has taken a highly idiosyncratic 
approach to funding research projects without adequate scientific 
peer review that it has sought to polish sdis image by getting 
university researchers involved with the program and that it has 
oversold the potential for civilian spinoffs from sdi research 
you cant spend that amount of money without coming up with 
some little odds and ends said john pike associate director for 
space policy at the federation of american scientists a 
washingtonbased public interest group but i sure havent seen 
anything thats going to rescue the american electronics industry 
rosy nimroody a national security analyst with the council on 
economic priorities a new yorkbased organization that has issued 
several reports critical of star wars said the ist program was 
definitely oversold 
she said in recent years officials running the program have 
become more restrained in using ist for sdi imagebuilding but she 
added i think there still remains an effort to get as many 
people as possible so they can go around and say we have x number 
of universities involved in sdi 
ist supporters however argue the program has been successful 
in promoting innovative projects which compare well with the 
scientific output of other pentagonsponsored laboratories 
my own assessment is that within sdi i think that a program 
like ist is very important and is in many ways the 
highestquality and most promising part of the entire program 
said ashton carter acting director of the center for science and 
international affairs at harvard theyve done well at attracting 
proposals that are reasonably good and that will have some 
application even if we never build a missile defense system 
duston said about 50 percent of ists research money goes to 
academic institutions 30 percent to private companies and 20 
percent to government laboratories the program has contracts with 
researchers at 95 us universities 
ist projects which he said appear promising but are likely to be 
slowed because of reduced funding include 
optical computers whose central processors operate very fast 
because they utilize pulses of light rather than electricity 
ist in conjunction with other agencies including the office of 
naval research and the national aeronautics and space 
administration had planned to mount an aggressive program to 
construct a firstgeneration allpurpose optical computer within 
the next two years well just have to stretch it duston said 
advanced diamond technology opening up new fields of diamond 
optics highly heatresistant electronic components and other 
future applications such as superhard coatings on surgical 
instruments istfunded researchers had been making progress in 
growing thin diamond layers on nondiamond materials 
highpower microwaves for disabling the electronics of enemy 
missiles aircraft and other weapon systems duston said ist likely 
would delay plans for field tests of a highpower microwave device 
because of the tight budget

hundreds of thousands of people returned to the 
streets sunday to block army troops who cut a bloody swath through 
the city the night before killing hundreds and clearing tiananman 
square of prodemocracy protesters 
troops fired at citizens in at least one incident late sunday 
and protesters were reported blocking streets in shanghai chinas 
largest city there were no troops there according to shanghai 
radio 
the slaughter that left at least 500 dead perhaps thousands 
drew worldwide condemnation but failed to completely quell the 
7weekold studentled campaign 
chinese sources said senior leader deng xiaoping ordered the 
bloody invasion from a hospital where he is seriously ill with 
prostate cancer even if theyre functioning out of ignorance 
they are still participating and must be suppressed deng 84 
was quoted as saying of the protesters 
the sources were from the office of li xiannian the former 
president and now the head of an important advisory body officials 
never have confirmed deng is seriously ill 
tens of thousands of troops were stationed around the 100acre 
tiananmen square as many as 200000 more were believed camped in 
the outskirts of the city 
other areas of the capital were dominated by hundreds of 
thousands of angry citizens who bolstered barricades to restrict 
troop movements 
chinese students marched tearfully in taipei paris london san 
francisco new york los angeles oslo and vancouver in hong kong 
which will revert to chinese rule in 1997 about 200000 people 
rallied to mourn the beijing slaughter 
the military entered the city to enforce martial law declared 
may 20 but not enforced then because of a government power struggle 
caused by the protest movement the struggle pitted hardliners such 
as deng and premier li peng against moderates such as communist 
party leader zhao ziyang who reportedly lost his post 
soldiers began shooting beating and running over beijing 
residents late saturday as they finally started their deadly push 
to tiananman square where students were in the third week of a 
sitin flames from burning military vehicles seized by protesters 
lit up the sky and bodies were scattered in the streets 
on sunday evening about 100 troops charged into a residential 
area just north of the square shooting into narrow alleyways as 
women clutched their babies and people fell to the pavement after 
the attack residents came out again and taunted the soldiers with 
cries of fascist 
thousands of people returned to the xidan intersection about a 
mile west of the square to reerect barriers and set fire to 
military vehicles and buses 
people blocked some roads with large trucks others with simple 
food stalls 
before this happened we loved the party said one 
40yearold worker now we oppose the party we deeply oppose the 
party 
the worker was one of thousands walking through the fuxing 
hospital in western beijing where 21 bodies were laid haphazardly 
on the floor 
about 200 yards west of the hospital at the muxidi 
intersection was a large abandoned convoy of military vehicles 
that had been torched flames still shot out of some of the 70 
trucks vans and armored personnel carriers 
muxidi was the scene of a pitched battle saturday night with 
troops bombarding citizens with tear gas and gunfire before 
blasting through their barricades 
it was horrible they killed old folks and small children 
said one weeping old man 
except for the area around tiananmen the city was generally 
free of troops although there were reports the army planned to 
move into the university campus area in the northwest 
troops shot indiscrimately during the march to tiananman 
citizens responded by hurling rocks no casualty toll was 
available but a doctor said 500 people died and others said the 
death toll may be in the thousands several thousand were hurt 
one doctor said he was aware of a young man who was strangled by 
troops with chains 
official government announcements on the army attack aired 
repeatedly on national television said the troops suppressed a 
counterrevolutionary riot and achieved a great victory in the 
struggle to end turmoil in the capital 
the beijing municipal government said soldiers and police 
strictly observed discipline and said their heroic acts and 
glorious exploits have won fervent praise and strong support from 
the masses of students and citizens 
the reports said three soldiers were killed and more than 1000 
injured by thugs but did not mention casualties among the 
populace 
an announcer for the englishlanguage radio beijing monitored 
in washington said thousands of people mostly civilians were 
killed the station later switched announcers and returned to 
reading government pronouncements 
the evening news showed a tank knocking down the goddess of 
democracy a 33foothigh replica of the statue of liberty that 
was put up by students 
the studentled protests began april 15 with students calling 
for talks with the government on bringing greater social freedoms 
and ending official corruption regular citizens joined the 
protests and at times 1 million people poured through the streets 
on march 13 students began a roundtheclock occupation of 
tiananman martial law was declared seven days later but efforts 
by troops to move against the students were thwarted peacefully by 
huge throngs who massed around convoys urging soldiers not to 
fight them 
two staffers of the american television network cbs 
correspondent richard roth and cameraman derek williams were 
released sunday night after being detained in tiananmen the 
networks office said 
a reporter for the french magazine paris match was slightly 
wounded when a ricocheted bullet hit him and a japanese 
photographer was shot in the foot two reuters correspondents were 
detained one was blindfolded roughed up and held for six hours

jaruzelski was accompanied by his wife barbara and joked that 
he marked his ballot more quickly than she did 
voters chose 100 people for a new senate the only freely 
elected legislative chamber in the east bloc it will have veto 
power over legislation passed by the 460seat sejm 
opposition candidates were permitted to run for 161 or 35 
percent of the sejm seats under an agreement on political and 
economic reforms reached in april between the government and the 
solidarityled opposition 
the agreement also legalized the trade union which had been 
banned for seven years after a martial law crackdown in december 
1981 
solidarity voiced confidence before the elections but the 
government appeared nervous that some of its bestknown figures 
running unopposed for the sejm on the socalled national list 
might nonetheless receive less than 50 percent of the vote 
without half the vote national list candidates would be 
defeated and the sejm seats would not be filled a runoff is set 
for june 18 for all other races in which no candidate receives 50 
percent of the vote 
walesa said he would be satisfied if solidarity won 25 percent 
of the sejm seats and 75 percent of the senate 
many voters treated the election as a referendum on the partys 
45 years of rule both sides agree that political changes will not 
quickly or dramatically improve the economy burdened by a 39 
billion foreign debt shortages inefficiency and 80 percent 
inflation 
the historic day broke damp and gray but turned sunny in the 
afternoon large crowds appeared at polling stations after people 
in the heavily roman catholic country emerged from mass 
there were more than 22400 polling stations nationwide 
solidarity members set up tables outside many stations and gave out 
names of the movements candidates technical information on how to 
vote and even lollipops in solidarity wrappers 
if after 40 years one has a chance to choose one should take 
the chance said mrs ufnals husband andrzej 
everybody at my workplace thinks that if solidarity enters the 
sejm something will change and they will be able to join in the 
governing process said the young father 
it feels totally different one older woman said after 
voting now there is a freedom of choice 
many people said they voted after years of boycotting in which 
the only candidates were those approved by the communist party 
walesa urged all eligible to vote calling the election a 
chance now to make this the country of our dreams 
communist authorities proposed the talks that led to the 
political and economic reforms after a wave of severe strikes in 
august 1988

an unusual nonbinding trial begins monday 
with selection of jurors to hearing a 300 million lawsuit brought 
by neighbors of a government plant that processed uranium for 
nuclear weapons 
the summary trial a rare form of court proceeding is an 
effort to encourage a settlement in the class action suit 
representing about 14000 people who live near the feed materials 
production center in fernald and national lead of ohio inc which 
operated the plant for the federal government from 1951 to 1985 
the plaintiffs allege the 38yearold plant 18 miles northwest 
of cincinnati has polluted their soil air and water with 
radioactive materials as well as asbestos chlorides and barium 
damaging their health lowering the value of their property and 
causing them emotional stress 
us district judge s arthur spiegel set aside more than a week 
for the summary trial 
the plants owner the us department of energy denies charges 
made in the suit but has begun a cleanup program at the plant site 
the department admits that over the years more than 300000 pounds 
of radioactive uranium oxide got past the plants airfiltering 
systems and into the air 
both sides have prepared for the mock trial as if it were 
binding knowing that a jury finding against their side would 
create pressure on them to settle the plaintiffs lawyer stanley 
m chesley said he wants to negotiate a settlement in the case but 
the energy department is unwilling and he hopes the trial will 
encourage a settlement 
were finally going to hear the story of fernald were 
finally going to have it in a court of law chesley said we 
think its a wonderful opportunity to resolve a dispute 
energy department lawyer henry a gill jr declined to say if 
the department would be willing to settle the case he said no 
settlement talks are under way 
the energy department contends that national lead was a 
contractor following government orders and is innocent the 
department has conceded that the government told nlo to put 
priority on production even if it meant ignoring environmental 
regulations it says that is no longer the case with the current 
operator westinghouse materials co 
spiegel has previously used the summary trial a method some 
lawyers and judges dislike to coax a settlement in a complex case 
that might otherwise take up weeks of court time 
gill said he would not regard the jurys verdict as a final 
statement 
absolutely not its by its very nature a nonbinding 
verdict its a settlement tool that some judges like to avoid 
using gill said 
he declined comment when asked if he thought a summary trial was 
a good idea in the present case 
chesley said he will tell the jury that the plants neighbors 
want the government to pay money that they can get regular medical 
monitoring including cancer detection tests 
the courts offer a faster and better way for the residents to 
get relief than waiting for washington to clean up the plant he 
said 
its always been my view that the court system is the great 
equalizer im not taking anything away from congress chesley 
said but the courts do cause litigation and disputes to be 
resolved the only place you can get true compensation for 
victims is in the courthouse 
the judge ordered officials of the energy department and 
national lead to attend the trial

transsiberian railroad exploded as two packed passenger trains 
passed sunday incinerating rail cars in a tornado of fire 
killing many people and leaving 800 missing tass said

scene of the accident which the official soviet news agency 
described as a huge catastrophe and a terrible tragedy it 
was the third serious train accident in the soviet union in a year 
the pipeline containing liquefied petroleum gas exploded at 114 
am as the trains passed each other on opposite tracks between the 
towns of ufa and asha 745 miles southeast of moscow tass said 
the agency said gas seeped from the conduit and caught fire but it 
was not clear what caused the leakage 
the agency said the trains were carrying 1200 people and only 
400 were accounted for some of the rail cars were incinerated the 
agency said 
military units are searching the adjacent forest and mountains 
in the hope that some of the passengers managed to escape from the 
tornado of fire tass said

to his city 62 miles west of the remote accident site in the ural 
mountains 
helicopters are constantly arriving with more injured he 
said in a telephone interviewits terrible its monstrous the 
people are very shocked and are suffering about what happened he 
said his voice shaking 
tass said there were numerous victims but neither the agency 
nor zaitsev gave a death toll 
gorbachevs decision to fly to the scene indicated the death 
toll was high 
also going to the scene were soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
russian federation premier alexander v vlasov defense minister 
dmitri t yazov and health minister yevgeny i chazov 
the emergency trip by gorbachev recalled his decision in

armenia where some 25000 people were killed in an earthquake 
the transsiberian railroad links the western european part of 
the country to the asian region in the east the passenger trains 
involved were traveling between novosibirsk the largest town in

weve never before had such a high casualty toll on the 
railroads he said without giving figures a lot of children 
died because they were returning home from the south where they 
had been on vacation there were a lot of mothers with children 
whole families yeltsin said 
the people at the boisterous rally in a stadium parking lot 
suddenly fell silent when yeltsin proposed a minute of silence to 
mourn the victims 
on june 4 1988 nearly 100 people died in an explosion of three 
freight trains in arzamas a city in the volga river valley 240 
miles east of moscow the trains were loaded with industrial

ten years ago yan ke fled the khmer 
rouge killing fields evaded an advancing vietnamese army and was 
put in fetid refugee camps he said he never expected to see his 
homeland or family again 
with a little nephew in tow the refugee ended his odyssey in 
the united states haunted by the past and concerned about 
survival in a strange land 
but yan ke did well and recently was able to join an increasing 
number of his countrymen cautiously returning for visits from the 
united states france australia and canada rather than crossing 
border minefields this time he traveled on airliners from 
columbus ohio to phnom penh 
his aging parents and nearly 40 family members were waiting for 
him 
when i stepped off the plane and they were all there i could 
say nothing yan ke said and i nearly cried when i saw my 
ruined country they need everything 
three generations posed for his video camera within the former 
royal palace compound a haven of peace before the cambodian war 
khmer rouge terror vietnamese invasion and civil strife 
yan ke said he was a high school student in the northwestern 
province of battambang when khmer rouge guerrillas routed the 
usbacked government in 1975 
like many strong teeagers he was separated from his parents 
and said he was assigned to a work brigade reward for labor in the 
fields amounted to several spoonfuls of rice mixed with water and 
vegetable scraps 
an uncle a cousin and several other relatives were among the 
hundreds of thousands killed by the khmer rouge yan ke said 
at night he would listen to victims being taken away to the 
killing fields and hear the thud of blunt instruments against human 
flesh yan ke said he still has nightmares about one boy from his 
brigade who kept a shoulder bag he had found in the forest this 
criminal was brought before the workers then his throat was 
cut and his stomach slit open 
in 1979 with vietnamese troops invading yan ke said his family 
held a futive family reunion it was decided that he and a 
3yearold nephew voeun ke would try to make it to the thai 
frontier another brother and two sisters would remain to care for 
the parents 
he and his nephew reached the border after three days of 
walking yan ke said but robbers took the bits of gold he had 
concealed in a pack of cigarettes 
for more than a year yan ke and his nephew lived in swelling 
refugee camps in thailand and the philippines then with the help 
of a roman catholic charity they arrived in the united states and 
in 1981 settled in columbus where 2500 other cambodians have 
found homes 
yan ke said he worked as a machine operator in a steel mill 
then got a job with the state employment office he also earned a 
bachelors degree in computer science and developed a home repair 
business 
still single he and his nephew live in one of four apartments 
that he owns it was tough being a father without any experience 
but ive learned yan ke said his nephew prefers hamburgers to 
rice and is forgetting the cambodian language 
like many cambodians and other indochinese refugees yan ke sent 
thousands of dollars to his relatives recently he decided to see 
them again 
some of my cambodian friends said i was crazy and the us 
state department warned that they could not help me if i got into 
trouble yan ke said 
but he also knew cambodians had been returning over the past 18 
months and the government hoping to attact tourism and 
investment had encouraged them despite recent liberalization and 
prospects of a settlement of the cambodian conflict a communist 
party is still in control within and khmer rouge guerrillas are 
still mobilized 
many still dont trust the situation he said but id 
like overseas cambodians to become more involved in helping the 
people here especially the children 
yan ke visited schools without books and clinics with few 
supplies he plans to raise money in ohio to help a clinic 
its enough suffering we need a break yan ke said one 
night in phnom penh look at those who were born in in the khmer 
rouge era and werent as lucky as my nephew they have only seen 
the dark side of life

the house is expected to install new speaker 
this week and then turn to one of the biggest pieces of legislation 
of the year a bailout of the troubled savings and loan industry 
the senate hopes to finish work on its version of a bill that 
started off as mostly an emergency increase in veterans spending 
but which has become a menagerie of lawmakers pet priorities 
house speaker jim wright beset by ethics charges announced 
last week he would relinquish his gavel upon the selection of a 
successor 
democrats on tuesday plan to caucus and nominate thomas s 
foley dwash currently the majority leader for that job the 
full house will ratify the nomination later in the day 
the house will then take up president bushs proposal for joint 
development of a fighter jet with japan 
a senate vote last month already made it clear the project known 
as the fsx will go forward but house opponents want a chance to 
vote on what they say amounts to the united states giving away 
technology that made america the worlds leading aircraft 
manufacturer 
prime minister bhutto of pakistan is scheduled to address a 
joint meeting of congress on wednesday 
the house is scheduled to begin debate later wednesday on its 
version of bushs plan to revamp and keep solvent the savings and 
loan industry 
the massive legislation rejects the presidents notion that its 
50 billion in costs should be hidden from the taxpayers by keeping 
them offbudget the senate in its version went along with 
bushs budget scheme even though the overall costs are several 
billion dollars higher in the long term because the complex 
offbudget mechanism would mean higher interest payments 
the legislation includes measures designed to more carefully 
control the thrift industry to avoid future calamities the 
financial institutions have lobbied hard to minimize those new 
restrictions 
the senate has been bogged down on a tiny piece of legislation 
compared to the sampl matter a 33 billionandgrowing 
supplemental spending bill for the remainder of fiscal 1989 
the white house warned that emergency spending was needed before 
memorial day to keep veterans health programs from running out of 
money but the deadline passed without calamity 
so the senate plans on tuesday to spend a third day loading up 
the bill with whatever favored amendments senators can offer and 
win 
after last weeks work the bill includes such items as aid to 
apple farmers whose sales have been hurt by consumers reluctant to 
digest fruit sprayed with the chemical alar and aid to kansas 
farmers hurt by drought 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
whose committee produced the bill included 75 million to rebuild 
a 100yardwide radio telescope in west virginia that collapsed 
last year and several other more earthly projects for his home 
state 
not all amemdnets are pork barrel and some are controversial 
sen john mccain rariz plans an amendment this week to delay a 
portion of the new catastrophic illness insurance program 
there is little controversy over the basics of the bill it 
provides 12 billion for veterans programs including health care 
which need a cash influx to carry them until the end of the fiscal 
year extra money is also provided for student loans food stamps 
and the cost of fighting the forest fires last year in the west 
the house has already approved its version of the spending bill 
the two chambers must settle on identical bills before the measure 
can go to the president 
despite the busy legislative week there will be considerable 
behindthescenes action in the house foley the no 2 man is a 
sure bet to be smoothly installed as speaker but the ethics 
controversy also has claimed majority whip tony coelho dcalif 
who announced hell step down rather than face an inquiry like the 
one endured by wright 
with foley moving up to speaker that leaves the democrats with 
both their no 2 and no 3 slots to fill an election on those is 
expected next week and prominent democrats are fighting for 
position 
reps richard gephardt dmo and ed jenkins dga are 
competing for the majority leader post 
the whips race is a fourway contest between reps william h 
gray iii dpa beryl anthony dark david bonior dmich and 
henry waxman dcalif 
gray spoke out sharply last week after news reports citing 
unnamed justice department sources said the congressman or members 
of his staff were under investigation 
attorney general dick thornburgh on sunday called absolutely 
false charges that the justice department has become politicized 
and that senior officials there deliberately leaked the information 
to embarrass gray 
i have directed that every resource that we have in the 
department of justice be brought to bear on the investigation of 
the leaks thornburgh said on the cbs program face the nation

three palestinian guerrillas and an israeli 
soldier were killed in a shootout on the border with lebanon when 
the guerrillas tried to infiltrate by cutting through the fence 
the army said 
two soldiers were also lightly wounded an army spokesman said 
on condition of anonymity 
it was the fourth such incident on the israellebanon border in 
eight days 
the syrianbacked democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine claimed responsibility in a communique 
the raid was in reprisal for retaliatory israeli air raids on 
guerrilla bases in lebanon on wednesday according to the 
communique released in beirut 
also sunday prime minister yitzhak shamir warned jewish 
settlers to stop attacking arab communities in the israelioccupied 
territories 
settlers have conducted raids to punish palestinians for stoning 
attacks on israeliowned cars a 13yearold palestinian girl died 
in a revenge raid last week 
no one is entitled to take the law into his own hands 
shamir said in a statement released after a weekly cabinet meeting 
about 70000 settlers live in 130 jewish settlements in the west 
bank and gaza strip which were captured from jordan and egypt in 
the 1967 middle east war the gaza strip and west bank are home to 
17 million palestinians 
one jewish settler accused of attacks on palestinians has been 
banned from entering arab areas the maariv daily reported sunday 
the settler david axelrod 22 allegedly assaulted an israeli 
soldier patrolling the west bank town of hebron last month 
a defense ministry official confirmed the activities of a jewish 
settler had been restricted by jerusalem but would not name him he 
said the order was the first of its kind in the 18monthold 
palestinian uprising against israeli control of the territories 
also sunday 22yearold khaled al natur died of a gunshot wound 
he suffered in a clash with troops two days earlier officials at 
ramallah hospital in the west bank said 
his death raised to 505 the number of palestinians killed since 
the uprising began twentytwo israelis have died 
the border clash was the fourth infiltration attempt into israel 
since may 28 the incident began before dawn when guerrillas opened 
fire on israeli troops patrolling a border security road north of 
the misgav am collective farm 
israeli sgt maj hassin muktaren who was leading the troops on 
foot died instantly of a gunshot wound army officials said the 
three arab commandos were killed when the soldiers returned fire 
they said 
israel set up the security zone in southern lebanon in 1985 to 
protect its border 
meanwhile omar qassem 48 a senior palestinian guerrilla 
leader who was captured by israeli soldiers after leading a 
crossborder guerrilla raid from jordan in 1968 died sunday in an 
israeli hospital his family said 
qassem was hospitalized about two months ago with gall bladder 
kidney and liver problems he had been serving a life sentence 
ordered by an israeli military court 
his death came as palestinian activists held a news conference 
to appeal to israel to release him it also occurred as the 
government considered exchanging qassem for the remains of an 
israeli soldier believed to have died after capture in lebanon in 
1983 israeli sources said

in brilliant sunshine and a 
stiff wind hundreds of american paratroopers floated onto a field 
in normandy on sunday to commemorate the jump made by the first 
allied troops on dday 45 years ago 
thousands of people gazed skyward as eight c130 transport 
planes circled overhead and 450 members of the 82nd airborne from 
fort bragg nc and the 3rd battalion 325th infantry of 
vincenza italy tumbled from planes 
it was windy fast the speed was exhilarating said sgt 
john thomas of freeport ny with the 82nd known as the 
allamericans 
some of thomas buddies were less thrilled with the winddriven 
drop and at least one paratrooper was injured suffering a broken 
arm 
spec mike herman of stamford conn collided with another 
paratrooper about 150 feet off the ground but was not injured 
i landed a foot from the river with a face full of canopy 
the 21yearold paratrooper said of course id heard a lot of 
stories about jumping here about church steeples and rivers and 
trees and we knew we were in for a rough time 
but the demonstration jump was easy compared to the one made in 
the predawn darkness of june 6 1944 then 1500 american 
paratroopers jumped behind enemy lines a few hours before the 
seaborne assault that signaled the end of adolf hitlers nazi 
germany 
you could see the ground fire coming up on the paratroopers 
from the germans in ste mere red burning traces tearing through 
the air the men were clearly visible their parachutes shining in 
the moonlight recalled retired army maj lewis allen of 
fayetteville ark who as a pathfinder jumped about 30 minutes 
ahead of the other paratroopers on dday 
while allen watched the men being picked from the sky more than 
180000 troops were moving across the english channel for the 
greatest amphibious assault in history 
the invasion of normandys beaches known as operation overlord 
began at dawn on june 6 three million american canadian and 
british soldiers collected in england and later reinforced the 
troops who opened up a 50mile stretch of coastline on dday 
lively and solemn ceremonies will be held over three days to 
honor the allied forces and the 367000 soldiers who were killed or 
wounded in the battle

actress theresa saldana is terrified that a 
crazed fan who nearly butchered her seven years ago will try to 
finish his deadly divine mission after he is released from 
prison next week 
threatening letters that wildeyed scottish drifter arthur 
jackson have written to the actress have been unceasing over the 
years prison authorities cannot stop his mail and even though 
federal authorities will deport jackson upon his release they 
agree there is nothing stopping him from returning 
jackson 53 has a long history of psychiatric problems and has 
been under the care of a psychiatrist in prison but he was given a 
june 15 parole date for good behavior after serving seven years of 
a 12year sentence for the vicious march 15 1982 attack in 
california inmates automatically earn one day off their sentence 
for every day served without trouble 
threats are not considered grounds to keep a person in prison 
you have to act on the threats said deputy district attorney 
michael e knight who prosecuted jackson 
in a letter to saldana after the attack jackson said he 
regretted using a knife on her because a gun would have given me 
a better chance of reunion with you in heaven 
it is just unbelievable that he is getting out said miss 
saldana 34 i feel like i am in a nightmare i really feel my 
rights are being overlooked why is it life liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness is being taken from me 
we know he will attempt to carry out his threats said 
knight but we have no way to protect her unless he tries to 
carry out his threats it doesnt speak very well for a society 
that is supposed to protect the rights of all people 
miss saldana a newlywed who is five months pregnant said it 
terrifies me he will be in the streets of europe with no 
supervision 
jackson spent a year in a scottish psychiatric hospital after a 
nervous breakdown at age 17 he crossed the atlantic and joined the 
us army in 1955 then suffered another mental collapse that 
landed him in an army hospital for psychiatric care 
jackson was discharged from the army after a suicide attempt and 
later deported to scotland following his arrest in 1961 for 
allegedly threatening president john f kennedy 
he became obsessed with miss saldana after watching her films 
including raging bull and i want to hold your hand and his 
diaries revealed he thought he was on a divine mission and 
could win the actress by sending her into eternity in 1982 he 
entered the united states illegally to hunt her down 
jackson attacked miss saldana outside her apartment stabbing 
her 10 times and bending the blade of his kitchen knife with the 
force of his blows 
i will never forget the searing ghastly pain the grotesque 
and devastating experience of this person nearly butchering me to 
death or the bonechilling sight or my own blood splattered 
everywhere saldana told the judge in a 1984 resentencing 
statement resentencing hearings are held when changes in 
sentencing laws may affect an inmate 
since the attack miss saldana has become a spokeswoman for 
victims rights and did a television movie about the case 
victims for victims she also has recently completed an action 
movie angel town 
fan fanatics are not new to the show business world but the 
saldana attack was one of the most vicious in recent memory 
it isnt a case of one actress and one crazy fan these 
threats happen to others chronic persistent threats i know 
other celebrities who have been threatened said miss saldana 
she wouldnt name names but an obsessed fan currently faces 
trial in los angeles on charges of threatening family ties tv 
star michael j fox and his family with death in connecticut an 
emotionally disturbed woman posing as the wife of talk show host 
david letterman has broken into his house several times and in 
1980 former beatle john lennon was shot to death near his new york 
city apartment by a disturbed admirer 
like miss saldana the delivery man who saved her life by 
stopping jacksons attack is furious about the impending release 
actually i dont think he should even be deported i feel he 
should be here in jail for the rest of his life said jeff fenn 
who quit his water company delivery job after the attack and became 
a deputy sheriff 
fenn also has gotten 40 letters from jackson but doesnt feel 
threatened 
i dont see him coming after me now ive got a gun i didnt 
have one then he said he said his mission wasnt finished and 
i got in his way

irans oil minister said sunday that a 
key opec meeting will be sped up so he can return to tehran for the 
funeral of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries was 
scheduled to open a formal meeting monday to plan its pricing and 
production strategy for the rest of the year 
analysts expect opec to set a new elevated production output cap 
of 195 million or 20 million barrels a day a level that would 
likely hold prices at current levels and do little to gasoline 
prices at the pump 
khomeinis death saturday raised questions about the cartels 
work schedule iran a large crude oil producer is a leading 
member of the organization 
gholamreza aqazadeh the iranian oil chief said government 
officials were not requiring that he return to iran but he said he 
wanted to return to be with my people in iran and participate in 
the funeral ceremony 
he said the other oil ministers were discussing the situation 
i think due to the circumstances the conference will end 
sooner than expected he said through an interpreter 
opec officials began preliminary discussions friday on pricing 
and production goals for the last six months of the year on 
sunday the ministers met privately in their rooms to try to 
arrange a deal 
we still have a way to go said libyan oil minister fawzi 
shakshuki 
the ministers appear ready to boost their production ceiling 
now at 185 million barrels a day with a target price of 18 a 
barrel 
aqazadeh said he expected demand for opec oil to grow about 1 
million barrels a day in the last six months of the year implying 
the cartel might lift its ceiling to at least 195 million barrels 
daily 
he said deciding how the increase should be distributed among 
the producers is our main problem he declined to elaborate 
saying only i think we will reach an agreement 
oil prices have soared since the ministers late last year 
slashed output in the first six months of 1989 the average price 
of a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec is nearly 1770 a 
barrel more than 43 percent higher than in late november 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

americans who were held hostage in the us embassy in iran 
after the ayatollah khomeini and his islamic revolution took 
control mostly reacted calmly sunday to news of the religious 
leaders death 
obviously im not one of his big boosters but it doesnt 
serve any purpose to find satisfaction in khomeinis passing 
said paul lewis a marine guard at the us embassy in iran when it 
was seized in 1979 
lewis and 51 other embassy workers were held for 444 days before 
being released in january 1981 he said he holds khomeini 
personally responsible for the taking of the hostages but said he 
harbors no personal grudge against the ayatollah 
tehran radio reported early sunday that khomeini died in a 
hospital in the iranian capital 12 days after undergoing surgery 
for intenstinal bleeding he was 86 
lewis a financial planner in champaign ill said the ordeal 
of being held hostage was in some ways an opportunity for him to 
think and sort out his priorities in life 
i tried to turn it into a positive there will be absolutely 
nothing i try to do the rest of my life that will be that 
traumatic lewis said theres no reason i shouldnt be 
successful in whatever i do there arent many people who get to be 
tested like that 
warren christopher former us state department negotiator and 
now a los angeles lawyer said of khomeini i felt so long as he 
was alive there would be little improvement in usiran relations 
he had such a monstrous hatred for the us 
i wouldnt expect any immediate change but i dont think his 
level of hatred can be maintained 
asked if khomeinis death will boost hopes of freeing terry 
anderson and other americans held hostage in lebanon by supporters 
of iran christopher said 
iran certainly plays a significant role in that his hatred so 
dominated the relationship we couldnt go forward over time i 
would expect a more favorable relationship 
another former hostage retired air force col thomas e 
schaefer was away on a trip said his wife anita in phoenix 
ariz 
i dont think that either one of us would have too much of a 
reaction to it said mrs schaefer to say anything bad about 
someone dying isnt very polite and to say how we feel about 
well we dont have any comment on that 
i really dont want to comment said jerry j miehle of 
mount pleasant pa who was a communications officer in the us 
embassy when it was taken over 
but another former hostage kevin hermening 29 of mosinee 
wis was less restrained in his reaction 
it is probably the best news that has happened to the world in 
a decade he said iran can now move on to a postkhomeini 
era 
he was boldly marching that country into the 15th century 
said hermening who was the youngest hostage 
it has been such a tragic situation that nation has an 
opportunity to rejoin the community of nations he said 
hopefully this will open the door for some more normal relations 
between the united states and iran 
im not the type to say im happy hes dead said another 
former hostage barry rosen but i do feel to a certain degree 
that that part of the nightmare is over for us and for iran 
lewis predicted turmoil in the scramble to choose a successor to 
khomeini he said the west always underestimated khomeini a man 
with great political savvy who always knew which way the wind was 
blowing 
i dont think anyone ever gave him as much credit as he 
deserved for being a great politician lewis said khomeini had 
a great deal of influence personally that wont be transferred to 
any other person

congress is mired in its current predicament 
over ethical standards in large part because lawmakers find it 
easier to accept specialinterest income supplements than run the 
political risk of voting themselves pay raises 
although partisan politics and increasing media scrutiny 
contributed mightily to the atmosphere that impelled house speaker 
jim wright and democratic whip tony coelho to announce their 
resignations their underlying difficultly stemmed from allegations 
formal or otherwise that they violated or may have violated 
house rules on outside income 
those rules clearly allow various types of outside income they 
are much less clear in defining what counts and doesnt count as a 
violation 
in wrights case for example he did not deny his financial 
past indeed the charges were based largely on information he 
reported on public disclosure forms what wright argued was that 
his actions did not constitute a violation of the rules his 
accusers maintained otherwise 
without question members of congress can accept campaign 
contributions from special interest political action committees 
can take trips to exotic resorts paid for by special interests and 
can accept cash for speeches those who have been around long 
enough can even convert campaign contributions to personal use as 
long as they pay tax on the money 
congress allowed various income supplements to continue even in 
the postwatergate era of reform so long as they were disclosed 
and did not exceed certain limits the philosophy was that each 
members constituents would get a chance to decide at the polls 
each two years whether they approved of the way their 
representative was conducted his or her financial affairs 
there was considerable support in the house earlier this year 
for proposals to ban speaking fees and other outside earned income 
in exchange for an acrosstheboard pay raise 
but there was an intense public outcry against a pay raise 
initially a 50 percent boost that would raise salaries from 89000 
to 135000 and there was little support for banning honoraria 
without a salary increase to compensate for what in effect would 
be a pay cut for many members 
on top of the ethics charges already brewing against him wright 
came under criticism from outsiders for appearing to be trying to 
engineer the raise without a vote and privately from some of 
his colleagues for not trying hard enough to get the raise through 
without a vote 
wright had believed the 50 percent pay raise was too large and 
eventually favored having the house vote on a 30 percent increase 
but the vast majority of members didnt want to be recorded as 
voting for any pay raise 
then came the wrenching partisan political battle over president 
bushs nomination of former sen john tower rtexas to be 
secretary of defense tower was defeated and fellow wright a 
fellow texan complained after his own downfall that he had been 
victimized by vengeanceseeking republicans 
congressional republicans were eager to exploit the wright 
ethics problem because democrats had tried to use the socalled 
sleaze issue against republicans during the 1988 presidential 
campaign referring often to the many reagan administration 
officials who had run afoul of executive branch ethics rules 
some people have said that the ethical standards have 
changed said fred wertheimer president of common cause the 
selfstyled citizens lobby that is not the case what has 
happened is that standards that have existed for years are now 
being enforced standards that for too long had not been paid 
attention to 
wertheimer said that while salary increases are greatly 
needed the more pressing need is for congress to cleanse itself 
of specialinterest influence the way of life on capitol hill 
has to be changed so that the money chase is ended you have 
members of congress right now who live off special interests both 
professionally and personally 
norman ornstein a political analyst with the private american 
enterprise institute said congress would not be likely to solve 
the problem by coupling a pay raise with a prohibition on speaking 
fees and other special interest money but he suggested such a move 
might be worth trying in the present circumstance 
youd still get consumer activist ralph nader going bananas 
and radio talk show hosts going ballistic he said but i do 
think the public would eventually accept it 
john f banzhat a george washington university law professor 
said that while he doesnt believe members of congress are 
underpaid there has to be a dramatic change in the system even 
if that means a pay increase 
what theyre doing is taking payola he said we told disc 
jockeys at radio stations years ago that they couldnt do that and 
congressmen still do 
he said that while congress has shown itself more sensitive to 
ethical problems in recent years its rules of conduct often 
amounted merely to finetuning the amount of payola they could 
take 
in the meantime members of congress vent their frustrations 
publicly and republicans and democrats engage in what ornstein 
called a congressional adaptation of the war between the hatfields 
and the mccoys 
politics is a blood sport and an unforgiving business said 
rep james slattery dkan the reality is and you know this 
going in you can make a mistake even after 30 or 40 years of 
service and your career can end

liberal and conservative congressional leaders 
both demanded sunday that president bush end military aid to china 
in retaliation for the governments bloody suppression of 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
rep stephen solarz dny warned that unless bush takes a 
stronger stand on china congress will do it for him 
the president who spent the weekend relaxing at his 
kennebunkport maine home brushed off reporters questions about 
the bloodletting as he took an early morning jog on sunday 
upon his return to the white house the president again chose to 
offer no response to reporters queries about the crisis 
in washington leading members of the presidents own party 
demanded action 
rep mickey edwards of oklahoma chairman of the house 
republican policy committee criticized what he called the 
administrations excessively cautious reaction to the military 
crackdown in beijing 
diplomatic messages of disapproval are a pretty puny reaction 
to the murdering of innocent civilians whose only crime is to want 
the same freedoms we in the west take for granted edwards said 
in a statement issued by his office 
the defense department the state department and the commerce 
department ought to act immediately in unison to put some 
substance into the us condemnations he said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said sunday a state 
department task force has been mulling over policy options for the 
president adding there is no indication of what direction we 
might go or when he would get the specific options 
asked about demands for cuts in us military aid fitzwater 
said the administration did not want to act precipitously we 
want to make sure that our response is correct 
there are a number of ways that the united states government 
can express itself in this matter its appropriate that we act in 
the right fashion and not too quickly fitzwater said well 
consider all the options and choose an appropriate course when the 
time is right 
solarz chairman of the house foreign affairs asian 
subcommittee and sen jesse helms rnc ranking gop member of 
the senate foreign relations committee expressed outrage at the 
violent turn of events in beijing and demanded a review of the 
uschina relationship 
i think it would be politically unacceptable and morally 
unthinkable for us to continue to sell arms to a country that 
is engaged in the wanton slaughter of its own people solarz said 
helms who vowed to ask the senate on monday to approve such a 
step said he believes there is strong bipartisan support for 
the move 
indeed sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of foreign 
relations subcommittee on east asian and pacific affairs also 
called for a halt to all military assistance and cooperation with 
the peoples republic saying uschinese relations had been dealt 
a bloody blow 
but sen richard lugar rind another member of the senate 
panel advised a cautious approach approving of bushs calm and 
stable response to the situation 
he ought to keep our ambassador there we ought to keep 
maintain our agreements to supply aid lugar said on nbctvs 
meet the press the senator said the us leverage in the 
matter is always very limited there are some situations we 
really cannot control 
former secretary of state henry kissinger who helped forge the 
first us ties to china during president nixons term also 
advised that the president cant afford emotional outbursts in 
the present situation 
appearing on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
kissinger said he was appalled by the events in beijing but 
cautioned that the united states must be very careful about 
considering cutting ties with the chinese in order not to give the 
soviet union a free ride in influence in asia 
but solarz appeared to be unsatisfied by bushs statement on 
saturday calling for nonviolence restraint and dialogue 
secretary of state james a baker iii in a saturday television 
appearance called the events extremely deplorable and said the 
us government was disturbed by the violent turn of events 
i think we have to manifest our concern over what happened in 
china by deeds as well as words its simply not sufficient to say 
that we are disturbed by what happened solarz said on cbstvs 
face the nation 
we have to make it clear that the united states will not 
continue to conduct business as usual with a government that 
engages in the wanton slaughter of its own people and i have to 
say that if the president doesnt take the initiative in changing 
american policy in this regard the congress will do it for him 
solarz said 
the uschinese relationship has blossomed on economic 
military and political fronts since formal diplomatic relations 
were established in 1979 
since that time the united states has sold more than 748 
million in arms to china most recently a 100 million deal in 
which beijing purchased six chinook ch47d helicopters manufactured 
by boeing co 
china with us approval also reached a 245 million agreement 
with grumman corp in 1987 under which the us company improved 
the avionics of chinas f8 fighter jet 
we never should have gotten into the business of supplying 
arms to any communist country helms said adding he wanted to 
cut off all that sort of thing 
helms a longtime foe of relations with communist china said 
the china military needs to understand that there will be a 
harsh reaction if the violence continues 
besides calling for the immediate return of ambassador james 
lilley solarz sad the united states should consider a suspension 
of trade in hightechnology items and a change in immigration 
regulations to allow those chinese students now in america who 
supported the democratic movement to remain here until it is clear 
they wont be punished upon their return 
the state department has set up a roundtheclock desk to 
monitor the situation in china 
one official confirmed that the chinese ambassador han xu had 
been called into the state department on saturday to hear the us 
expression of deep concern about the violent developments in 
china 
us officials are in constant touch with chinese officials 
in beijing and washington the official said

japan threatened sunday to file a 
formal complaint against the united states under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade claiming it had been accused of 
protectionism under a new us trade law 
shigeo muraoka japans vice minister for international trade 
and industry said he considered filing an official complaint 
before the 96nation trade forum a possible approach 
the us government last month identified japan brazil and 
india as nations that had erected unfair barriers against imports 
of american goods in line with a recently beefed up section of a 
us trade act known as super 301 
the new rule has irritated japan the european economic 
community and other competitors because it opens the way for 
washington to impose retaliatory sanctions without waiting for 
gatts permission 
the us hasnt done anything that would be a basis for a 
japanese complaint us trade representative carla hills said 
we have simply exposed open for the world to see where trade 
barriers are 
if we have to retaliate weve failed in our discussions 
she added we dont like to fail 
trade minsters from the us japan canada and the 12nation 
eec are meeting informally in the hague 
muraoka who spoke to reporters after the meeting said the new 
us law seriously undermines the spirit of free trade 
he said the us should ask gatt to set up a panel to 
investigate the american allegations to resolve the dispute 
muraoka said 
alternatively japan might request a gatt working group to 
determine whether the law is consistent with the trade forums 
rules he said gatt should also encourage bilateral talks between 
washington and other nations targeted by the measure muraoka said

walt disney co and news corp have 
settled a threeweek old 15 billion lawsuit in which the rupert 
murdochcontrolled company accused disney of fraud 
news corps satellite tv company sky television had claimed 
in the suit that disney had failed to meet terms of its agreement 
to launch the disney channel in the british satellite network 
sky television operates four direct broadcast channels sending 
directly from a communications satellite to a dish at the 
consumers home the deal with disney called for it to supply 18 
hours of daily programming 
besides starting a disney channel for the new enterprise in 
england disney also had agreed to help operate a payperview 
service called sky movies according to the suit 
but news corp alleged that disney dragged its feet seeking to 
change the terms of the agreement news corp sought 1 billion in 
punitive damages and 500 million in actual damages in the may 15 
lawsuit 
under terms of the agreement announced late friday sky will 
purchase disneys undisclosed interest in the joint venture and 
sky will continue to license disney films from touchstone pictures 
and its newly announced hollywood pictures production company for 
the next five years 
disney and sky television will continue to discuss terms of a 
possible disney channel but disney is no longer obligated to 
supply the programming and apparently is free to go elsewhere and 
establish a foothold in recently deregulated european television 
murdoch the british communications and publishing mogul has 
said he hopes the sky television service can reach 1 million 
satellite dish customers in great britain and ireland by early 1990 
walt disney studios president richard frank said disney will 
continue to pursue opportunities for establishing the disney 
channel in these key markets 
the lawsuit had said barry diller head of fox inc the los 
angelesbased entertainment group owned by news corp intervened 
and asked disney executives for better cooperation diller worked 
with disney chairman michael eisner for nearly 16 years at both 
paramount pictures and abc 
eisner denied friday that the two men clashed over the issue 
i never had any quarrel with barry and disney never had any 
quarrel with 20th century fox our dealings were always with the 
british subsidiary of news corp eisner said 
the disney chief said he dealt directly with murdoch in settling 
the suit
