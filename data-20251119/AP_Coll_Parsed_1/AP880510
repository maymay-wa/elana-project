activists in the western massachusetts 
towns where the nuclear freeze movement was born are attacking 
star wars with the tactic they used so well eight years ago 
town meetings 
so far residents of 13 communities have voted to order their 
town clerks to notify president reagan of their displeasure with 
the satellitebased missilekilling system also known as the 
strategic defense initiative 
the antisdi article failed in two other towns and was tabled in 
a third but activists said monday they were heartened by the 
results thus far fifteen to 20 towns are expected to debate the 
question in may and june 
albert einstein said nuclear technology should be discussed on 
the village square said frances crowe of the american friends 
service committee of northampton who is helping to organize the 
drive against sdi 
these town meetings are really the most democratic way of 
letting the people discuss and decide about nuclear issues said 
crowe 
she and others in the coalition to stop star wars a group of 35 
area activists hope to use the town meeting votes to get an 
antisdi question on the statewide referendum in november 
in western massachachusetts where democrats outnumber 
republicans by better than 31 towns have never been shy about 
their opinions on global matters 
the nuclear freeze movement began on the floors of town meetings 
in western massachusetts in the spring of 1980 it spread to the 
ballot box that fall when voters in the four westernmost counties 
instructed their state senators to favor a resolution asking the 
president to propose a mutual nuclear weapons moratorium to the 
soviet union 
in 1983 the house of representatives passed a freeze resolution 
by a 21 margin 
antiwar activists have since turned to the town meetings a 
350yearold institution to tell the president their thoughts on 
such matters as nuclear test ban treaties 
antiwar sentiment runs deep in towns such as amherst where 
residents have voted in town meetings against hostilities involving 
us forces since the war of 1812 
to get a question on a town meeting warrant a resident need 
only collect 10 signatures on a petition the coalition to stop 
star wars went town to town to find sponsors for antisdi articles 
and held seminars explaining sdis cost to each community 
the 1502 residents of ashfield for example unwittingly 
contributed an estimated 24990 to star wars in fiscal 1988 
said michael holroyde of the traprock peace center in deerfield a 
nonprofit privately funded group since the sdi research project 
began in 1983 he said ashfield has contributed 91000 
voters at ashfields town meeting approved the antisdi article 
in a voice vote 
for people who have to fight hard to pay for schools and 
police and fire departments it puts the whole thing into 
perspective said dr ira helfand of northampton a member of the 
national board of directors of physicians for social responsibility 
however some of that money comes back the university of 
massachusetts whose main campus is in amherst was the 
20thlargest sdi contractor in the nation according to star 
wars the economic fallout by the new yorkbased council on 
economic priorities 
the book said that that in fiscal 1985 and 1986 the university 
received 124 million in sdi contracts 
the sdi issue has sparked much heated discussions in town 
meetings but rarely have voters questioned why the matter is 
before them holroyde said what we are talking here about is 
programs we are paying for he said 
only whately voters rejected the resolution as an inappropriate 
topic for their town meeting in a 3528 vote holroyde said 
at the whatley meeting resident kenneth a daniels questioned 
the arguments of sdi critics youre criticizing the 
government he told them to me it sounds like propaganda 
besides ashfield the articles were approved by voice vote in 
the franklin county towns of conway and shelburne and were denied 
by voice vote in northfield franklin county voters approved the 
articles by ballot hand vote and lineups in colrain 5650 heath 
4213 leverett 594 shutesbury 424 and wendell 9635 
in hampshire county the articles passed on voice votes in 
cummington huntington and pelham 
in berkshire county the articles passed in monterey 4816 and 
by voice vote in windsor

vietnam veterans with posttraumatic stress 
disorder were less sensitive to pain after seeing scenes from a war 
movie according to a study which gives a glimpse into the complex 
biology of the disorder 
the finding may also be a step toward new treatments scientists 
said 
this may well be getting at some basic core biological aspect 
of ptsd said roger pitman of the veterans administration medical 
center in manchester nh 
pitman and colleague scott orr did the work with bessel van der 
kolk and mark greenberg of harvard medical school pitman was 
interviewed before speaking monday at the annual meeting of the 
american psychiatric association 
posttraumatic stress disorder is estimated to affect hundreds 
of thousands of people who have survived battle airplane crashes 
earthquakes and other extreme stresses 
often appearing several months or years after the event the 
disorder causes sudden memories of the event that can be so vivid 
that the person thinks he is going through it again powerful 
nightmares onslaughts of emotions that appear to have no cause 
and avoidance of close relationships can also appear 
the condition is treated with psychotherapy and some drugs 
appear to help researchers hope that by understanding biological 
underpinnings of the disorder they can find more effective 
medications 
animals exposed to extreme stress such as inescapable electric 
shocks typically lose sensitivity to pain pitman said because 
their bodies release natural painkillers called endorphins 
when animals are given a substance called naloxone that blocks 
the action of endorphins sensitivity to pain returns to normal he 
said 
the same phenomenon has been reported in humans exposed to 
electric shocks he said 
the new work involved eight vietnam veterans with the disorder 
and eight combat veterans who did not develop the condition 
researchers applied heat to their forearms and asked them to 
rank the intensity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 100 the 
experiment was done at several temperatures and the ratings were 
averaged 
the veterans pain sensitivity was measured before and after 
they watched 15 minutes of an ambush scene from the vietnam movie 
platoon 
the experiment was done twice one time the veterans received 
the endorphinblocking substance naloxone and the other time a 
placebo neither the veterans nor the researchers knew which was 
being administered at the time 
six of the eight veterans with the disorder showed a decrease in 
pain sensitivity after viewing the ambush scene and getting the 
placebo the decrease averaged about 30 percent 
naloxone prevented the decrease in sensitivity showing it was 
due to endorphins pitman said 
even with the placebo no change in pain sensitivity appeared in 
seven of the eight other veterans 
pitman said he doubts the endorphins themselves cause symptoms 
of the disorder but that their appearance in response to the movie 
reflects a learned response caused by the severe stress of the 
original combat experience 
the finding is new evidence that the disorder does indeed have 
a complex and unique biological basis said matthew j friedman 
professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at dartmouth medical 
school and chief of the psychiatry service at the veterans 
administration medical center in white river junction vt 
it supports the theory that the disorder is associated with 
biological alterations in the brains endorphin system affecting 
the brains emotion and arousal centers he said 
in another study reported monday researchers found that nine 
posttraumatic stress disorder patients tended to have a different 
hormone profile from that of seven depression patients 
scientists at the yale university school of medicine found the 
difference by studying each patients levels of cortisol 
epinephrine growth hormone norepinephrin testosterone and 
thyroxin

a jury monday convicted a man accused of being 
denvers capitol hill rapist of 14 counts in connection with 
assaults on six women 
the sevenwoman fiveman jury convicted quintin wortham 27 of 
five counts of rape one count of attempted rape six burglary 
counts and two counts of theft district judge lynne hufnagel set 
sentencing for friday wortham could be sentenced to a maximum of 
350 years 
wortham who acted as his own attorney throughout the trial his 
second was charged with five rapes and one attempted rape in 
denvers capitol hill neighborhood in 1985 and 1986 
his first trial ended in a mistrial because of his behavior 
while acting as his own counsel 
district attorney norm early said the jury saw that justice 
was done it was a very swift verdict 
wortham who took more than two hours during closing arguments 
on friday trying to convince the jury of his innocence showed no 
emotion as the verdicts were read monday 
wortham had claimed the victims misidentified him 
one woman who testified against wortham in both trials told 
reporters following the verdict it had been difficult to look him 
in the face i didnt do it often but when i was called on it 
reaffirmed my conviction he was the man 
hufnagel disallowed results of a new dna test that prosecutors 
say proved that wortham raped a woman in 1985 the judge said 
admission of the scientific evidence would not be fair to wortham 
and could result in a reversal of a conviction 
hufnagel said no appeals court had yet approved dna testing and 
only five states not including colorado accept it

commerce secretary c william verity urged a 
highlevel chinese delegation monday to end protectionist measures 
that have forced some us companies to question the wisdom of 
pursuing business in china 
verity made his comments as he greeted chinese vice premier tian 
jiyun at the start of the sixth meeting of the two governments 
joint commission on commerce and trade 
tian said china is unswervingly pursuing the policy of reform 
and opening to the outside world as part of its program to 
build a socialist political system with a high degree of democracy 
a system that it is effective and full of vitality 
during the day vice president george bush hosted tian at a 
dinner at blair house the restored us official guest quarters 
the vice premier was scheduled to meet president reagan on tuesday 
verity told the chinese delegation that the united states is 
making progress in reducing trade deficits and asserted that the 
united states has recovered from the shock of a wave of imports 
that swept the country 
china meanwhile over the past year has overcome challenges to 
its economic reforms and reaffirmed its commitment to reform 
verity said 
however he noted china at the same time has expanded import 
controls and raised tariffs 
in the past two years he said china has restored some 
confidence in the climate for joint ventures with foreign firms 
but still high cost and uncertainty of doing business are 
forcing some us companies to question the wisdom of pursuing 
business in china 
verity said chinas recently announced firststage foreign trade 
reform is a major step in promoting competition but he complained 
that trade restrictions appear to have increased a 
significant number of new import barriers have appeared 
a policy which stresses exports while heavily protecting the 
domestic market will also lead to increase friction in the 
bilateral trade relationship between china and the united states 
he added 
tian in a speech released by the chinese embassy said us 
industries should recognize that there is fierce competition to 
sell to china and that he hopes they will become more competitive 
by improving quality technical features and terms of trade 
he called for eventual removal of all undue restrictions on 
selling us hightechnology products to china and urged the 
united states not to impose any new controls against import of 
chinese textiles his countrys major export 
verity said the united states would work with china to smooth 
its entry into gatt the general agreement on tariffs and trade on 
terms that would bolster beijings efforts to promote open market 
conditions and competitiveness 
the secretary also said the united states would continue to 
expand transfer of high technology in its china trade 
a basic objective of the threeday commission meeting was to 
increase that trade which last year reached a 104 billion total 
in both directions verity indicated the session would air measures 
to improve the business environment for us firms trading with 
china in such areas as patent and copyright protection contract 
and dispute procedures and profitability

massachusetts gov michael dukakis showed 
strength among reagan democrats in the nebraska and west virginia 
presidential primaries tuesday a good sign for him in november 
should he win the democratic nomination 
nearly a quarter of the democrats voting said they backed 
president reagan in 1984 but about threequarters of them said 
this year they would support dukakis over george bush an abc news 
exit poll found 
dukakis could bring home the reagan democrats said abc news 
poll analyst doug muzzio he noted that the finding has been 
consistent since abc started asking the question in its connecticut 
exit poll march 29 
the abc poll tuesday said jackson scored one of his best 
showings of the primary season with white voters in nebraska 
winning 24 percent of the white vote he did better only in 
vermont where he won 32 percent in an abc poll 
still dukakis won all white subgroups in nebraska and won 
overwhelming majorities of voters of all groups other than blacks 
in west virginia muzzio said dukakis even made some inroads into 
the small black vote winning 32 percent of the black vote in west 
virginia and 11 percent in nebraska 
blacks made up 4 percent of the total in west virginia and 5 
percent in nebraska and the margin of sampling error is high for 
such a small group in a poll among all voters the error margin 
was 5 points in the surveys 
as in other recent contests dukakis appeared acceptable to 
voters across the spectrum of political ideologies in his party 
muzzio said a majority of liberals a majority of moderates and a 
plurality of conservatives said his views were just right as 
opposed to too liberal or too conservative 
in a sense ideologically dukakis is a rorschach test 
muzzio said voters of different ideologies look at dukakis and 
are seeing what they want to see in a sense hes all ideologies to 
all voters 
still muzzio noted that a sizeable share of voters about 30 
percent said they did not know enough about dukakis ideological 
stand to answer the question on ideology 
jackson who appealed to distressed farmers in nebraska for 
their votes ran somewhat more competitively there than in west 
virginia about a quarter of the voters said the poor and elderly 
were a key issue to them and jackson won that group 52 percent to 
44 percent for dukakis another quarter said an ability to bring 
changes was key and jackson won them 50 to 42 abc said 
the key issue to the most voters in both states was job 
protection and dukakis won a majority of that group 
most significant for the fall muzzio suggested was dukakis 
support from reagan democrats in west virginia 23 percent of the 
primary voters told abc they backed reagan in 1984 and 73 percent 
of them said they would vote for dukakis over bush in nebraska 22 
percent of the total said they voted for reagan in 1984 and 78 
percent said they would take dukakis over bush

the leftfielder wore a 
38caliber pistol on his hip and the sandlot baseball game was 
held on the obstacle course of an army base 
but the jewish settlers most american emigrants intently 
pursued the us pastime on a sunny afternoon in may and saw little 
strange in the setting in fact they viewed their ball game as a 
symbol of the normalcy of life in the occupied west bank 
this could be anywhere in the usa on a summer afternoon 
mordechai goodman 46 said surveying the field where about 30 
israelis aged 5 to 50 had gathered to watch and play 
goodman who wore a houston astros tshirt quit a job as a 
mens wear salesman in manhattan two years ago to move to the west 
bank settlement of efrat nearby where he opened a pizzeria 
i guess you could say this is a sign of how normal life is 
here he said tossing a softball to his 4yearold son shimon 
maybe so but ephraim benzeev a physician who had jogged over 
to the field from efrat to watch his teenage son play carried a 
357 magnum on one hip he said the gun was insurance against being 
ambushed by palestinian youths 
i wear it in case there is a sudden shower of stones thank 
heavens i havent had to use it yet said benzeev who was 
listening to rock music on a radiocassette player 
he stood along the foul line that led past a large piece of 
board used to train soldiers to scale walls the flames of an 
explosion were painted on the wood in fading red and orange 
settlers maintain that media concentration on five months of 
palestinian riots has given a distorted picture of the actual 
situation in the occupied west bank and gaza strip they say daily 
life continues largely unaffected for the 65000 jewish residents 
of the occupied territories 
while there is no evidence that settlers are leaving their homes 
in the occupied lands government and settlement officials agree 
that the unrest has affected potential residents 
yossi margalit a housing ministry official said the impact has 
been greater on the commuter settlers who live just outside 
israels 1967 borders and are lured primarily by the chance to live 
in a house with a yard instead of in an cramped urban apartment 
there has been some decline in purchases of homes in towns 
near the israeli border margalit said but deeper into the 
territory where the idealists live there hasnt been a change 
he estimated that housing sales have declined by a few 
percentage points but stressed there has been no mass departures 
from the area some perhaps have left the large settlements for 
personal reasons but the palestinian uprising hasnt been the 
dominant factor he said 
even before the riots began dec 8 the settlement building 
program had slowed since 1984 the government has approved six 
settlements but people are living in only four 
government spending on settlements which totaled 2 billion 
between 1968 and 1986 has declined from a 198283 peak of 250 
million a year to 150 million at the end of 1986 according to 
meron benvenistis west bank data project the studies by the 
independent center are funded by the us ford and rockefeller 
foundations 
in efrat eight miles south of jerusalem town manager yossi 
beck said the settlements bulletin board had notices from 
prospective buyers seeking houses 
but he said many of the 300 families who have moved in the 
hilltop community since 1983 have begun to wonder what will happen 
as a result of the unrest 
if it continues there is no doubt it will affect the idea of 
people moving here said beck an immigrant from holland my 
feeling is that after it calms down the interest in people moving 
here will resume 
shlomo riskin chief rabbi of efrat and a driving force behind 
its founding in 1983 said he was pressing ahead with plans to 
expand the settlement with 450 more houses and a religious 
education center 
this was just stones riskin said pointing to grape hill on 
which is built a cluster of villas with red tile roofs rows of 
houses under construction are going up on nearby pomegranate hill 
and more units are planned for date hill he said 
for riskin the attachment to this land is rooted in modern and 
ancient history and this lure is felt by residents most of whom 
are orthodox jews 
the young shepherd boy david raised his flocks here in efrat 
and the book of ruth takes place here in the city of efrat said 
riskin who emigrated from new york city 
at the same time he maintains there is a national consensus to 
stay in gush etzion the bloc of settlements that includes efrat 
this stems from the killing of 200 jewish settlers there in the 
1948 war of independence 
the unrest he said had strengthened settlers commitment if 
anything it has drawn us more closely together riskin said

dairy farmers are being asked to join a 
lobbying effort by the national milk producers federation to head 
off a further cut in federal milk price supports scheduled by the 
agriculture department next year 
the 72yearold federation which represents most of the 
nations dairy cooperatives wants agriculture secretary richard e 
lyng to use authority in the 1985 farm law to cancel the next 
reduction in milk supports on jan 1 1989 in favor of an 
alternate plan to cut production 
enough is enough federation president tom camerlo canon 
city colo said monday dairy farmers are tired of suffering 
continual price reductions after having done more to address 
federal policy concerns than any segment of us agriculture 
camerlo said lyng has the authority to set up a new wholeherd 
buyout or a diversion program both of which have been used in 
recent years to trim us milk production 
however lyng has been steadfast against reviving the buyout and 
diversion programs as an alternative to the reduction in price 
supports 
camerlo and other federation officials told a news conference at 
the national press club that the 50cent reduction scheduled for 
next jan 1 would put the milk support level at 1010 per 100 
pounds of milk the lowest since 1979 
dairy farmers will have to live at 1979 income levels with 
1989 costs he said 
milk price supports have been lowered progressively from a 
record high of 1310 per 100 pounds since 1983 to help discourage 
surplus production a diversion plan to pay farmers for cutting 
back production and a wholeherd buyout or dairy termination 
program also were used 
the 18month wholeherd buyout program began april 1 1986 and 
continued through october 1987 more than 122 million dairy cows 
heifers and calves were sent to market by thousands of producers 
who agreed to quit dairying for at least five years 
about 38 percent of the buyout programs cost of 18 billion 
was paid by dairy farmers themselves who were charged assessments 
on milk they sold similar arrangements helped hold down costs on 
the earlier diversion plan 
camerlo said the 50cent reduction next jan 1 would come as 
milk production costs including feed are on the upswing the 
twoway crunch would add up next year to a 37 percent slide in 
dairy farm income from 1987 levels 
dairy farmers have contributed 29 billion in assessments since 
1983 to reduce the costs of their programs by 50 percent overall 
camerlo said 
federation leaders have met frequently with usda officials 
including lyng in an attempt to persuade them to abandon the path 
of lower milk supports 
the secretary has been consistent as has his staff that they 
will cut the price camerlo said they do not intend to utilize 
the authority that they have in the 85 act to implement a 
wholeherd or dairy termination program 
camerlo said lyng stated that policy at the federations annual 
meeting in december 1986 and has not budged 
another 50cent cut in the dairy price support level on jan 
1 1989 is simply unsound policy he said it will increase 
not reduce federal dairy program costs and it will be as costly 
and perhaps more costly to the government than another limited 
dairy termination program 
the previous dtp in 198687 was designed to reduce milk 
production by 12 billion pounds camerlo said a limited dtp could 
be set up to cut production by 4 billion or 5 billion pounds which 
would serve as a stopgap measure until new legislation is worked 
out 
according to usda figures milk production in calendar 1987 
declined about 1 percent to 1425 billion pounds from a record of 
1438 billion pounds in 1986 but production is rising again and is 
expected to gain 1 percent to 3 percent in 1988 to another record 
level

walter f mondale says the interviews he held 
four years ago with prospective running mates proved a damaged 
strategy and he thinks michael dukakis ought to find a different 
way of selecting the democratic vice presidential nominee this year 
four years ago mondale interviewed a succession of candidates 
before he chose geraldine ferraro then a congresswoman from new 
york as the first woman on a major partys national ticket one by 
one the vice presidential hopefuls visited mondale at his home in 
minnesota 
in retrospect i dont think it built confidence mondale 
said of the process the 1984 democratic presidential nominees 
comments came in a telephone interview from his minneapolis law 
office on monday 
i dont think the way that process played out reassured 
americans he said its a damaged strategy even though it was 
not a bad idea 
he suggested that dukakis pursue a different way of looking at 
vice presidential candidates 
asked if he thought dukakis who now appears likely to lock up 
the democratic presidential nomination before the july convention 
should choose a southerner for his running mate mondale said i 
wouldnt say he has to but what i cant figure out is how you get 
the numbers if you dont run strong in the south 
mondale was optimistic about the democrats chances of winning a 
presidential election for only the second time in the last six 
weve got a shot at this deal he said 
republican vice president george bush is a troubled 
candidate he said i think he gets off in an uncertain way i 
think there are going to be vulnerabilities on both sides but 
dukakis looks strong as a person and i dont think bush does 
mondale said there is a need to constantly reassure americans 
that you possess that special presidential strength of character 
and independence and resolve to serve the public interest 
in recent campaign appearances bush often has seemed to be 
campaigning against jimmy carter under whom mondale served as vice 
president 
i believe thats a sign of weakness said mondale heres 
a guy who ought to be filling in the blanks where people are 
worried about him which is character and vision and direction and 
presidential status 
instead hes out there hacking around against a president 
whos been out of office for eight years 
mondale also suggested that dukakis avoid following his example 
of declaring that if elected president he would raise taxes to 
reduce the federal deficit 
i think its too bad that we cant talk about our real 
problems he said but i think the verdict is in on that

as democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
prepares for a likely fall campaign vice president george bush 
isnt the only one going after him dukakis has the likes of 
dorothea thomasvitrac to contend with too 
thomasvitracs dispute with the massachusetts governor is 
strictly a local affair but she like other political enemies of 
dukakis intends to do what she can to disrupt the governors 
presidential bid in order to make her point as dukakis comes under 
increasing scrutiny that task becomes easier and easier 
thomasvitrac is a member of the board of selectmen in the tiny 
western massachusetts town of new braintree where dukakis has 
proposed building a 500bed prison she has led the fight against 
it 
when dukakis went to iowa late last year to tell struggling 
farmers he was concerned about their plight thomasvitrac went too 
he wouldnt acknowledge me but i was blocking the only 
entrance to the pigpen thomasvitrac said i think i made my 
point 
former massachusetts gov edward king a former democratic 
governor who has switched parties is making his point too the 
bush campaign is bankrolling kings travel around the country 
criticizing dukakis 
king turned dukakis out of office in 1978 dukakis defeated king 
in 1982 
king made a speech monday attacking dukakis image as a 
competent manager 
i dont think its based on facts he said i think it 
sharply contrasts what he has done 
a dukakis presidency king said would bring an ever 
expanding more costly government more regulation more taxes 
another vocal dukakis opponent is barbara anderson the director 
of the antitax group citizens for limited taxation the group has 
successfully battled dukakis efforts in the last five years to 
create additional exemptions to a voterpassed property tax cap 
when dukakis takes credit on the presidential campaign trail for 
cutting taxes back home in massachusetts anderson fumes 
he was dragged kicking and screaming into those tax cuts 
said anderson the reputation is a fabricated myth 
when dukakis heads to california later this week to campaign he 
likely will be reminded of a policy in massachusetts that 
effectively bans homosexuals from becoming foster parents by 
encouraging placements of foster children in traditional 
families 
the washingtonbased national gay and lesbian task force since 
last year has organized protests of dukakis events and activists 
and newspapers in californias gay community have criticized the 
policy 
dukakis is a supporter of a gay rights bill languishing before 
the state legislature but the foster parent policy has tended to 
overshadow that 
hes responsible for a very discriminatory social policy 
said task force spokeswoman sue hyde 
massachusetts politics are dominated by democrats but not all 
of them shower praise on dukakis 
ive always felt that hes spent too much said rep john 
flood of canton chairman of the house taxation committee weve 
spent all this money and we havent addressed our major problems 
overcrowded prisons unfunded pension liability and the need for 
more money to clean up hazardous waste 
flood was quick to add of course george bush has a lot of 
baggage of his own 
charlie manning meanwhile is relishing his job these days 
as the top spokesman for the massachusetts republican party 
manning gets a lot of attention when he talks about dukakis 
manning said he has been fielding an incredible number of 
telephone calls from outofstate reporters in recent weeks 
not only does manning take every opportunity to rap the governor 
he calls the thought of a dukakis presidency scary hes 
always willing to steer journalists toward other critics of dukakis 
in fact he has a new card in his desktop rolodex just for 
numbers of dukakis enemies 
i made it just for moments like these he said with obvious 
glee

michael dukakis held one in a series of meetings 
with congressional leaders and renewed his demand that george bush 
detail his knowledge of alleged drug trafficking by panamanian 
strongman manuel antonio noriega 
dukakis did not campaign this week for todays primaries in 
nebraska and west virginia he took the weekend off and spent 
monday at the statehouse dukakis paid visits to both nebraska and 
west virginia last week however 
dukakis has said he is still focusing on jesse jackson and the 
remaining primaries but his comments about bush and the meeting 
with new jersey sen bill bradley were signs he is looking 
increasingly toward the fall campaign 
i think that the american people deserve an overall 
explanation about who in this administration was doing business 
with him noriega and why dukakis said monday 
i can tell you one thing if im the president we wont be 
doing business with drugrunning panamanian dictators dukakis 
said as he left his statehouse office 
bush spokesman peter teeley said monday that the vice president 
was aware before noriegas indictment on drug charges in february 
of speculation that the noriega government was involved in drug 
trafficking but teeley said the information was not substantive 
bradley told reporters that his meeting with dukakis centered on 
ussoviet relations he said the topic of the no 2 spot on the 
democratic ticket did not come up during the meeting adding he was 
not interested and would be a poor choice anyway 
thats not in the cards bradley said as he left dukakis 
office massachusetts and new jersey dont go well together 
bradley said he did not think dukakis lack of foreign policy 
experience would hurt him in his expected general election campaign 
against bush although the vice president has already raised the 
issue 
experience is no substitute for ability and hes got real 
ability bradley said 
bradley said he expected dukakis to defeat jesse jackson in new 
jerseys primary june 7 the same day as the california primary 
the massachusetts governor said he and bradley had a good 
discussion 
dukakis plans to travel to washington dc on thursday for 
meetings with congressional leaders including house speaker jim 
wright of texas and senate majority leader robert byrd of west 
virginia

george bushs defense on his two biggest 
campaign liabilities the irancontra affair and alleged drug 
dealing by panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega is the same a 
plea of ignorance 
on both counts the republican presidential candidate sounds 
alike 
although he once headed the central intelligence agency and a 
presidential task force on drugs he says he didnt know noriega 
was involved in alleged drug trafficking until this past february 
when a us indictment was handed down in florida 
even though a member of the national security council he says 
he had no hint that us arms were being sold to iran in an effort 
to free hostages or that proceeds were funnelled illegally to the 
contras in nicaragua 
the vice presidents continued denial of advance knowledge in 
both instances has hung over his campaign like a twoedged sword 
either he knew more than hes admitting in which case hes not 
telling the truth or the candidate who claims vast experience in 
foreign policy was kept in the dark on two matters of crucial 
international importance 
either way its a nowin political situation for bush 
the vice president has stock ways of dealing with the twin 
issues 
of irancontra he says he fully expects democrats to exploit it 
as a major campaign issue but claims thats only because they have 
little else to talk about 
and the political fallout so far has been minimal he claims 
its been tried it was used against me in the gop 
primaries he told reporters during a campaign stop last week in 
idaho it doesnt show up unless they democrats have got data 
that i havent seen as a great vulnerability 
i certainly cant say its a plus bush conceded but 
fortunately neither of them democratic candidates michael dukakis 
and jesse jackson has any experience at all in international 
affairs so i can offset the criticism by talking about the rest of 
the world thats what ive tried to do 
on noriega bush maintains he lacked clear knowledge that the 
panamanian general was involved in alleged drug dealings before the 
indictment three months ago campaign spokesman peter teeley said 
monday that bush was aware of rumors of such activity but viewed 
them as unsubstantiated 
we heard all sorts of accusations about the government in the 
bahamas columbia bolivia peru mexico and panama teeley said 
but the question is when do you get concrete evidence that 
something of this nature is indeed true 
as recently as last thursday in los angeles bush reiterated his 
denial of any advance knowledge of noriegas alleged drug dealings 
asked whether he ever had been told of reports of ties between 
noriega and drugs bush said not that i was ever aware of 
seeking to deflect criticism bush says the reagan 
administration sought to bring noriega to justice once we found 
out he had gone bad 
he also has made an antidrug theme a major thrust of his race 
calling for a western hempishere drug summit and for an 
international antidrug force under the auspices of the united 
nations and he has challenged dukakis and jackson to show theyre 
as serious as he is by joining him in supporting the death penalty 
for drug kingpins 
thus far the democrats have not gone for the bait 
democratic frontrunner dukakis accuses the reaganbush 
administration of dealing with drugrunning panamanian 
dictators and jackson asserts the reason mr bush has not led 
the charge to fight drugs is because he knew of the 
administrations dealings with the drug dealers 
the question of exactly when bush learned of noriegas alleged 
role in drugdealing was first raised in the republican primaries 
by sen bob dole of kansas bush has been hit with the question by 
reporters at nearly every campaign stop since 
the accusations go to the core of bushs campaign since he 
trumpets repeatedly his experience in international affairs with 
a resume that includes serving as cia director ambassador to the 
united nations envoy to the peoples republic of china and heading 
the south florida task force a federal druginterdiction effort in 
the early 1980s 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of a senate 
subcommittee on latin american affairs has said he would be 
surprised if bush didnt have advance knowledge of noriegas 
alleged drug trafficking given his extensive credentials if he 
didnt know thats almost as disturbing dodd says 
but teeley said monday the democrats have nothing to attack 
bush on they cant attack him on unemployment inflation interest 
rates theyre all down personal income is up real wages are up 
taxes are down there is a new armscontrol treaty so they are 
going to be looking for issues like this noriega and irancontras 
to attack him on

assistant attorney general william bradford 
reynolds has been challenged to back up his criticism of a 
bipartisan report saying attorney general edwin meese iii violated 
white house ethics policy 
sen carl levin dmich urged reynolds in a letter monday to 
kindly inform us of any incorrect information in the 244page 
report issued by his subcommittee 
the report accuses meese of violating white house ethics policy 
by helping the scandalplagued wedtech corp obtain a 32 million 
nobid army contract while he was counselor to the president 
reynolds on sunday called the report sleaze and said the 
policy went into effect after the wedtech thing was referred over 
to the attorney general 
however the senate report noted that memos sent to meese from 
his longtime friend e robert wallach seeking help for wedtech came 
to thenwhite house counselor meese in 1982 as well as in 1981 the 
white house policy barring contact by white house staff with 
procurement officers about a contract in which a friend has a 
financial interest took effect in october 1981 
in addition to asking reynolds to back up his criticism of the 
report levin pointed out that it was the work of four republicans 
as well as five democrats 
justice department spokesman terry eastland said reynolds will 
respond in due course to levins letter 
meese has acknowledged intervening on behalf of wedtech a south 
bronx ny defense contractor in connection with the 32 million 
army contract wedtech subsequently won the nobid contract 
meese says he merely wanted to assure that wedtech got a fair 
hearing

aldabra tortoises rarely breed in 
captivity but three have been born at ocean world in the last two 
months because of its stressfree environment a breeder says 
zoomer jr born march 31 has almost doubled his 40gram weight 
and now weighs 78 grams his brother the monthold hatchback has 
increased in weight from 31 grams to nearly 67 grams caylith born 
last week weighs 40 grams 
the hatching is a rare event in captivity said ed chapman a 
miami breeder of rare reptiles 
the marine parks success can be attributed to a soothing 
environment where the tortoises dont have to worry about goats 
eating them or about being served up as a delicacy as in their 
native seychelles islands chapman said recently 
stress is an important thing with reptiles he said it 
affects their growth and it affects their fertility if wild 
tortoises are disturbed they will still lay eggs but the eggs 
wont be fertile 
in the wild tortoises take about 25 to 30 years to reach their 
adult weight of 500 pounds chapman said 
were hoping that by feeding them lots of good vegetable 
protein such as cactus theyll reach their full size in about 15 
years he said if we can get them to mature and reproduce 
faster than they do in the wild then we will have learned 
something valuable for tortoise breeders

surgeon general c everett koop says that 
despite the wishes of almost the entire senate state and local 
governments are in a better position than the federal government to 
handle the nations drunken drivers 
koop attended a news conference monday at which several 
lawmakers handed the surgeon general a letter signed by 99 senators 
asking that he declare drunken driving a national crisis 
koop acknowledged that intoxicated drivers are the direct 
cause of far too many tragedies in our homes and neighborhoods 
but he said he believed there was little the federal government can 
do 
we can talk about things that can be done about it but unless 
we have on every level of state and municipal government a tougher 
policy with those people who are guilty of drunk driving then we 
are never going to succeed koop said 
and the people who can bring that about are the grassroots 
people in this country he said 
in their letter the senators wrote that about 24000 people are 
killed and 43000 seriously injured in alcoholrelated automobile 
accidents each year 
we urge you to focus national attention on this slaughter on 
our highways by declaring drunk driving to be a national 
crisis the letter said 
such a declaration would have no legal force but would focus 
publicity on the problem 
the letter was signed at the news conference by 12yearold 
charlene boyette of hopkins sc whose father was killed in an 
accident involving a drunken driver in 1986 
koop said that on june 15 a member of his staff will begin 
developing a plan his office can use to support efforts by citizens 
groups to reduce drunken driving he declined to say what the 
initiative would be 
when pressed by reporters on whether he would declare the 
national crisis requesed by the senators koop said i dont 
think it takes a surgeon general to declare a crisis when everybody 
knows there is a crisis 
he also said he felt a little bit put upon by people not in 
the government to assume responsibilities that are not mine and 
that i dont believe i can usurp 
sens john warner rva and claiborne pell dri who wrote 
the letter to koop both said at the news conference that they were 
satisfied with what the surgeon general said he would do 
the only senator who did not sign the letter to koop is joseph 
biden ddel who is recuperating from surgery on an artery that 
leads to his brain

joe numero will get his university of 
minnesota law school diploma sunday 60 years after a bureaucratic 
technicality prevented him from joining his classmates at 
graduation 
i expected to graduate with my class and get my diploma 
said the 91yearold minneapolis resident who went on to a 
successful career in business 
i even bought a cap and gown you know but at the last moment 
dean fraser told me there was bad news that i couldnt get my law 
degree because i didnt meet all the requirements and there was 
nothing he could do about it 
i didnt even show up to watch graduation 
he wasnt allowed to graduate because he didnt have an 
undergraduate degree 
according to university records numero was admitted to law 
school several years after returning from world war i even though 
he technically was short of meeting undergraduate requirements 
dean everett fraser father of mayor don fraser told him he 
would get credit for an officers training program 
but other university officials disagreed and rejected frasers 
request 
despite being denied a law degree numero passed the bar exam 
and worked in law a few years mainly as his own attorney in 
business deals 
business turned out highly lucrative for numero the founder of 
the bloomingtonbased thermo king transport refrigeration company 
the law school disappointment became just a faded memory until 
current dean robert stein heard about the story and saw a way to 
honor him at the schools 100th commencement 
stein wrote numero a letter asking for the privilege of 
presenting a long overdue diploma 
we work hard to have a fine line between sort of a dignified 
occasion because this is an important rite of passage and a warm 
family feeling stein said 
it seems to us that honoring joe numero is going to help us 
accomplish that balance i think its time to make the formal 
record agree with reality

the united states plans to send cash payments 
to contra rebels inside nicaragua that will enable them to buy food 
locally while a dispute over resettlement keeps them from receiving 
food and other supplies an administration official says 
the payments will range between 50 cents and 1 a day for 
thousands of contra fighters enough to keep body and soul 
together according to the official who spoke monday on the 
condition that he not be identified 
a final decision will be made later in the week by alan woods 
administrator of the agency for international development the 
official said 
after the contras and nicaraguas leftist government signed a 
temporary truce on march 23 congress approved a 479 million 
humanitarian aid package for the rebels consistent with a 
provision in the truce agreement 
the legislation permits deliveries of food clothing shelter 
and medical supplies and medical care for children who are war 
victims 
the agreement specified that the rebels receive the aid after 
resettling in seven mutually agreed ceasefire zones 
however no food or other supplies have been sent inside 
nicaragua because a dispute over ground rules within the zones has 
prevented the resettlement from taking place 
this has left some contra units with acute food shortages air 
drops have been ruled out because of fear that sandinista fighters 
might shoot down the planes used to transport the food 
at the time of the truce there were an estimated 12000 contras 
inside nicaragua but many have fled into honduras in search of food 
the monthly cost of the payments is expected to be between 
60000 to 450000 depending on availability of contra couriers 
based in honduras to deliver the cash and the number of rebels 
inside nicaragua that can be reached at any given time most of the 
payments will be in cordobas nicaraguas currency 
in addition aid has earmarked more than 300000 per month in 
family assistance payments to rebels with technical skills part of 
the funds are being assigned to resistance personnel who work at 
contra offices in miami 
nicaraguan authorities maintain that any humanitarian assistance 
sent to the contras without prior inspection by an officially 
designated verification commission would be illegal under the truce 
agreement 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega has objected vigorously to an 
interim program under which ussponsored aid is being sent by 
truck or air drop from tegucigalpa to contra camps on the honduran 
side of the border 
the bulk of this aid 262 metric tons has been sent by truck 
the official said the administration has denied ortegas claims 
that the shipments have contained lethal equipment insisting that 
the deliveries have received prior inspection from honduran church 
officials 
the ceasefire began on april 1 and is schedued to last for 60 
days during this period the sandinistas and the contras are to 
negotiate terms for a permanent ceasefire but little progress has 
been made in the talks

foreigners like americans are titillated and 
amused by revelations in former white house official don regans 
book but some experts say the outofschool memoir is more than a 
laughing matter for the united states abroad 
there is no doubt that his type of socalled revelations are 
harmful because they give foreigners the impression that us 
officials are not to be trusted says richard helms the former 
cia director this tends to erode their credibility 
regan was white house chief of staff until he was forced out in 
early 1987 reportedly after a feud with first lady nancy reagan 
his book for the record depicts president reagan as a passive 
president loathe to make decisions and manipulated by a wife held 
hostage to the stars 
books like regans diminish the presidents stature and for 
the rest of the western world so much depends on the presidents 
prestige said henry brandon longtime washington correspondent 
for the london sunday times and now a visiting scholar at the 
brookings institution a liberal think tank 
with a ussoviet summit in moscow less than a month away one 
soviet scholar said the book particularly details of mrs 
reagans penchant for astrology provides fodder for the russian 
propaganda machine 
perhaps more damaging though is that the revelations may 
reinforce the perception soviets have of americans as a weird 
superstitious and somewhat untrustworthy breed said jerry hough a 
professor at duke university and the author of a justpublished 
book russia and the west gorbachev and the politics of reform 
the stargazing passages confirm a picture of america that is a 
strange and in many respects a not totally rational place 
hough said daily horoscopes are not a regular feature in the 
soviet newspapers as they are in many american and european 
publications 
soviets have long been concerned that the united states is not 
a reliable partner because of congress failure to ratify the 
salt ii treaty among other things hough said 
regans book wont make it any easier for us officials to 
accomplish their goals at the coming summit he said 
on the other hand hough said the administration has lowered 
expectations about the summit to such a degree that regans book 
could have little impact 
several people said regans often scornful picture of what goes 
on behind the gates at 1600 pennsylvania avenue comes too late in 
the reagan presidency to do any real harm to his administration or 
to the united states 
many foreign governments are biding their time until the next 
president takes office anyway they say 
the soviet embassy was closed monday to celebrate the world war 
ii victory over germany but valentin falin the chairman of 
novisti the governmentcontrolled press agency made that point in 
a recent interview 
the us government is virtually crippled with indecision during 
an election year because no one knows what the future holds he 
said 
helms disagreed there is no reason why he cant make foreign 
policy decisions he said 
put in context regans book is not nearly as serious for us 
foreign policy as for instance the irancontra affair in which 
weapons were secretly sold to iran with profits diverted to the 
nicaraguan rebels said brandon 
diplomats at several embassies declined to be quoted by name in 
talking about the regan flap for fear of offending the united 
states a few chuckled but none considered the damage to the us 
image to be too serious 
george shultz might joke about it on the golf course with bob 
hawke said an australian referring to the secretary of state 
and the australian prime minister respectively it makes you 
look a bit silly he said 
herman nickel the former us ambassador to south africa in the 
reagan administration said books like regans are not helpful in 
a general sense to americans trying to carry out the 
administrations policies abroad 
at the same time he said foreigners understand that people 
with a grudge tend to tell their stories 
while diplomats were cautious foreign reporters had a heyday 
with the story 
people abroad think this is just another giggle said elgy 
gillespie who writes for the irish times in dublin its just 
one more hilarious thing about the reagans isnt it 
europeans have often mocked the reagans for their california 
tastes and their glizerati friends at the white house she 
said what are we going to do for kicks if kissandtell books 
are ever barred

by a man who said he was unfairly portrayed in an article about 
another libel case 
greg rushford a former congressional committee investigator 
sued the new yorker over an article by renata adler about former 
army gen william c westmorelands libel lawsuit against cbs news 
rushford a witness at the trial of westmorelands suit said 
the article unfairly portrayed him as being thought of by a judge 
as far out or a kook 
us district judge albert v bryan jr dismissed rushfords 
suit last year saying adlers article was no more than the 
authors opinion 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
upheld the dismissal on monday 
there is nothing in the record before us from which we could 
infer malice said the ruling by judges francis d murnaghan jr 
kenneth k hall and james dickson phillips jr 
westmorelands lawsuit which stemmed from a cbs documentary on 
his role in the vietnam war was settled out of court before its 
trial ended

a pennsylvania couple says relatives 
thought they had gone off the deep end when they began commuting 
625 miles to weekend jobs at the opryland usa amusement park 
joe and twila uzmack of knox pa leave their home every friday 
morning and drive to nashville where they work in an opryland 
information booth on saturdays 
some people think were crazy but we really love it here 
uzmack a 62yearold retired education said recently 
the uzmacks have been dividing their time between pennsylvania 
and tennessee for eight years uzmack saw an opryland helpwanted 
ad a few years ago and suggested to his wife that they apply 
i told him they wouldnt hire people our age but within 15 
minutes we were hired said 58yearold mrs uzmack who taught 
elementary school for 25 years we told them we wanted to meet 
people so they placed us in the information booth 
last year the couple stayed at their nashville retirement home 
but a few months ago uzmack was asked to act as temporary 
superintendent of a pennsylvania school district 
that is one of the reasons we are commuting this year he 
said 
mrs uzmack said the drive isnt bad we enjoy it its a 
break and gives us something different to do but occasionally we 
fly

american journalist terry anderson the longest 
held western hostage in lebanon was convinced a week ago that he 
would soon be released 
instead diplomat marcel fontaine and two other frenchmen were 
freed 
i am very sad because i spent the last six months with 
terry fontaine told andersons sister peggy say during a 
meeting monday at his home outside paris terry thought he would 
be let out before me and i told terry to tell my family what i am 
telling you now 
fontaine 45 was released by his proiranian shiite moslem 
captors wednesday along with fellow diplomat marcel carton and 
journalist jeanpaul kauffmann the three returned to france on 
thursday after nearly three years in captivity 
anderson 40 the chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press and one of nine americans missing in lebanon was 
abducted march 16 1985 in west beirut 
they the captors said either terry anderson will be out 
first or fontaine will be out first fontaine said 
on may 3 a guard told anderson to prepare his things fontaine 
said 
at midnight they took terry away and i stayed alone in the 
room at two in the morning somebody came and asked me if i knew 
i said no he said well youll be free this morning at 7 
oclock 
fontaine looking thin and pale said he felt fine he told of 
his experiences in the living room of his home with his wife and 
three sons 
fontaine said the greatest fear he and anderson had was that 
their governments would attempt a rescue raid 
when somebody knocked on the door two guards immediately 
stepped in pointed guns at us and waited for whoever was going to 
come in there is no chance that any commandos would ever get in 
without us being killed 
another fear was falling ill we had no right to see a 
doctor he said 
anderson does not know that his father and brother have died 
fontaine said he himself knew because he had heard it earlier on 
the radio but he didnt tell his cellmate because he did not want 
him to be depressed 
for terry his father is still alive 
once last year in a fit of frustration anderson beat his head 
against the wall until the blood flowed down his face 
i couldnt stop him because he is strong i called the jailers 
who were stronger i told terry to think of your wife and think of 
your family 
fontaine said none of the hostages received letters they were 
not allowed to read newspapers or listen to the news on television 
or radio 
they did however watch the miss usa pageant on television he 
said 
mentally terry has no problems we watched the women on 
television we were always laughing about it we saw the miss usa 
pageant it was miss texas who won he voted for miss michigan and 
me for miss mississippi 
fontaine said he thought anderson would survive 
hes very courageous the last time when i was a little sick 
and dispirited i said to terry that im not afraid to die but i 
dont want to die here and have them throw my body into the sea 
like they did with hostage william buckley 
terry said i dont want to die anywhere

a judge denied a defense motion for a 
mistrial monday even though a prospective juror said his mind was 
made up in the trial of a man accused of killing 16 people 
including 14 family members 
r gene simmons 47 is on trial for murder in two dec 28 
shootings in russellville he still must face trial on the 
christmas season slayings of his relatives at his home near dover 
a dozen jurors and two alternates were seated monday in franklin 
county circuit court opening statements were scheduled to begin 
tuesday 
prosecuting attorney john bynum said the states first witness 
would be russellville police chief herb johnston to whom simmons 
surrendered after the russellville shootings 
as jury selection began potential juror jack morton of ozark 
told judge john patterson in front of about 100 other prospective 
jurors i know too much ive been working down around dover a 
little bit ive got my mind already made up 
patterson said potential jurors would be asked later about what 
they had heard about the case 
ive not heard about it morton said ive been down there 
with the people 
while patterson was telling morton to stop talking defense 
attorney robert e irwin was objecting and making motions to quash 
the panel of prospective jurors and to declare a mistrial 
patterson denied the motions saying no harm had been done 
simmons is charged with two counts of capital murder in the 
deaths of former coworker kathy c kendrick 24 who officials say 
spurned his advances a year before she was killed and james d 
chaffin 33 who police say was a chance victim during a 45minute 
shooting spree if convicted of either count the sentence is life 
without parole or death 
simmons also faced five counts of attempted murder and one count 
of kidnapping in the trial the defense asked patterson to dismiss 
those counts but he refused

charges in the deaths of 14 family members simmons was arrested 
dec 28 after deputies found two of simmons children and their 
spouses shot to death and an 11yearold granddaughter strangled

and found seven bodies including those of simmons other children 
and his wife becky

in the trunks of abandoned cars on simmons property the babies 
were strangled

individually 
at times as many as 10 policemen were in the secondfloor 
courtroom in the twostory franklin county courthouse 
cameras are allowed in the courtroom only during recesses 
patterson decided 
patterson excused nine potential jurors for cause generally 
because they said they had concluded due to pretrial publicity that 
simmons was guilty the state excused seven prospective jurors and 
the defense only one

a persian gulf repair yard that serviced 
two us vessels damaged as a result of the iraniraq war said it 
made a profit for the first time last year 
the arab shipbuilding and repair yard said in its annual report 
that 1987 was its best year since it opened a decade ago in the 
persian gulf 
the drydock in neighboring dubai the largest repair facility in 
the middle east reported earlier that its business also has 
increased 
iran and iraq which have waged war for 7 years in the last 
year have intensified their attacks on gulf shipping 
the arab shipbuilding and repair yards annual report 
distributed by the gulf news agency gave no detailed breakdown of 
its profits 
but two major operations undertaken last year included repairing 
the us frigate stark which was badly damaged may 17 in an iraqi 
air strike that killed 37 sailors iraq said the attack was 
launched when a fighterbomber pilot mistook the frigate for an 
iranian warship 
the other repair operation was on the americanowned supertanker 
texaco carribean which was damaged just outside the gulf in august 
by a mine believed planted by iran 
mohammed khateeb secretary of the yards board of directors 
earlier told the gulf magazine arab ad that the company earned 22 
million last year compared to 113 million in 1986 thanks to 
two major contracts 
the magazine said the texaco carribean was one but did not name 
the stark 
it did not specify how many of those vessels were casualties of 
the socalled tanker war between iran and iraq 
coupled with a worldwide shipping recession over recent years 
shipping experts said the war has scared off an estimated 40 
percent of the vessels that once used the waterway 
iraqs gulf ports also have been closed since the early days of 
the conflict 
the arab shipbuilding and repair yard was set up in 1978 by 
seven of the 10 members of the organization of arab petroleum 
exporting countries bahrain iraq the united arab emirates saudi 
arabia kuwait qatar and libya 
about 500 merchant ships in the gulf have been hit in air and 
sea attacks as well as mines since early 1984 the uss samuel b 
roberts the second us warship to suffer serious damage in the 
gulf was taken to dubai for repairs after it was damaged by a mine

the government today signed a peace 
accord with a sinhalese extremist group to end a terrorist campaign 
that has taken at least 260 lives officials announced 
lalith athulathmudali sri lankas national security minister 
told a news conference that the agreement calls for members of the 
sinhalese peoples liberation front to give up their arms and cease 
guerrilla attacks 
in exchange he said the government agreed to lift its ban on 
the front and release all of the groups members from detention 
except those charged with murder or attempted murder 
the agreement was signed by athulathmudali and rohanna 
wijeweera leader of the group at an undisclosed location 
front members are to surrender all arms by may 29 at four 
buddhist temples athulathmudali said insurgency activities were 
to end immediately he said 
the front has been blamed for killing 260 politicians soldiers 
and government officials since july 
the peoples liberation front launched its campaign to show 
opposition to a peace accord signed july 29 to try to end the 
minority tamils separatist campaign in northern and eastern sri 
lanka 
the front contended that the pact made too many concessions to 
the tamils 
tamil militants have been fighting since 1983 for more political 
autonomy or an independent homeland claiming they are 
discriminated against by the islands majority sinhalese 
tamils who are mostly hindus make up 18 percent of the 
islands 16 million population the sinhalese who are buddhists 
comprise about 75 percent the rest are christian descendants of 
western colonalists or moslem descendants of early arab traders 
india which has an estimated 60 million ethnic tamils in its 
southern states brokered the july accord which calls for the sri 
lankan tamils to lay down their arms in exchange for new regional 
councils that will give them some say in local government 
activities 
but the largest of the rebel groups the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam rejected the accord india has sent more than 50000 
troops to the island to put down the tigers rebellion 
the peoples liberation front has a long history of 
antigovernment activities it was outlawed after an abortive 1971 
effort to overthrow the sri lankan government but it began 
regrouping in 1986 and 1987 
initially a radical marxist group it became the underground 
champion of the islands majority sinhalese 
the group has been blamed for two recent attacks on sri lankan 
military installations and the assassinations of several candidates 
for recently held local elections in southern sri lanka

a woman was found guilty of killing her husband 
and a woman to collect more than 175000 in insurance and the 
prosecutor says the conviction in the nations first 
deathbyproducttampering trial will stop drug tamperers 
stella nickell 44 of suburban auburn was convicted monday of 
all five counts in the deaths of her 52yearold husband bruce 
and sue katherine snow 40 also of auburn 
federal court jurors who deliberated nearly five days said 
mrs nickells daughters testimony against her mother proved 
crucial mrs nickell scheduled for sentencing june 17 could 
receive life in prison prosecutors also are considering state 
murder charges 
it was all there for jurors to make this decision 
assistant us attorney joanne maida said adding that the verdict 
will be a deterrent to wouldbe drug tamperers 
jury foreman murray m andrews 55 said the panel was split 
111 in favor of conviction through its first three votes 
the testimony of cindy hamilton mrs nickells 28yearold 
daughter was decisive i think without cindys testimony there 
were you might say too many missing links in the chain of 
evidence he said 
ms hamilton testified her mother discussed killing nickell by a 
drug overdose or by hiring a hit man 
although prosecutors were unable to link mrs nickell directly 
to cyanide purchases she was convicted of all five counts she 
faced two of causing death by tampering with a product involved in 
interstate commerce and three of tampering 
beset by financial problems and unhappy in her marriage mrs 
nickell laced extrastrength excedrin capsules with cyanide and 
gave them to her husband for a headache prosecutors said 
to make his death appear random she poisoned other bottles of 
excedrin and anacin capsules and put them on store shelves ms 
snow died after swallowing capsules from one of those bottles six 
days after nickell the prosecution said 
her husband paul webking said she might still be alive if 
local authorities had recognized the real cause of nickells death 
initially attributed to emphysema 
the effect of the verdict is secondary to the fact that sue is 
dead webking said no matter what the verdict is sues going 
to be dead 
i wish theyd hang her to the highest tree said ms snows 
mother marion chapman in a telephone interview from artesia nm 
king county prosecutor norm maleng said he would wait until 
after sentencing to decide whether to file state murder charges 
the deaths of nickell and ms snow touched off a nationwide 
tampering scare and prompted excedrin manufacturer bristolmyers to 
recall its capsuled nonprescription medicines 
product tampering is intolerable to society john weisberg 
spokesman for new yorkbased bristolmyers said when it occurs 
every effort must be made to identify those responsible and to 
bring them to justice he said 
seven people died in chicago in 1982 from cyanidelaced 
extrastrength tylenol but those deaths remain unsolved 
ms maida accused mrs nickell of poisoning her husband to 
collect on his life insurance public defender thomas hillier said 
mrs nickell was the victim of a lying daughter who stood to gain a 
300000 reward from pharmaceutical companies for information 
leading to an arrest 
mrs nickells plan failed because she was careless in mixing 
the poisonous capsules greedy for insurance benefits and owned two 
of the five tainted bottles of painkillers recovered ms maida 
said in closing arguments 
mrs nickell a tropical fish enthusiast used a bowl 
contaminated with an algaeicide for cleaning fish tanks when she 
mixed potassium cyanide with the anacin and excedrin painkillers 
the prosecution alleged 
traces of the compound were found in the five tainted bottles 
mrs nickell also lied about insurance policies and pressed 
medical authorities for a more specific cause of death ms maida 
said 
mrs nickell stood to receive 71000 in insurance if the death 
of her husband was from emphysema as pathologists first concluded 
but could have gotten 176000 if the death were ruled accidental 
the prosecutor said 
mrs nickell also left fingerprints on library books about 
poisons and cyanide ms maida said

robert a heinlein who spent a half 
century writing about mans relation to technology society and the 
universe was remembered upon his death at age 80 as science 
fictions prolific grand master 
he was probably the best of us all at his peak isaac 
asimov one of the top science fiction writers said monday he 
forged the route the rest of us followed 
his early stories in the 1940s were so far ahead of everything 
else being done that he made an enduring name for himself as the 
best science fiction writer 
heinlein whose books explored the future while questioning the 
morals and beliefs of the present died of heart failure sunday at 
his home in this seaside community 130 miles south of san francisco 
heinlein suffered for years from emphysema and had undergone 
numerous operations including one to relieve restricted blood flow 
to his brain 
heinlein a former aviation engineer dreamed up the water bed 
in his 1961 classic stranger in a strange land and envisioned 
an atomic power plant years before the manhattan project the 
current issue of books in print lists 64 books written by heinlein 
more than 40 million copies of his writings have been sold 
he won the nebula award from the science fiction writers of 
america in 1975 and an unprecedented four hugo awards in 1956 for 
double star in 1959 for starship troopers in 1961 for 
stranger and in 1966 for the moon is a harsh mistress 
his other works include the green hills of earth the man 
who sold the moon have space suit will travel and puppet 
masters 
heinlein wrote about worlds that people believed in said 
lester del rey a science fiction writerpublisher reached at a 
convention in las vegas nev he made them seem real and solid 
real livedin worlds his early work was quite extraordinary that 
way 
heinlein was born in butler mo in 1907 he graduated from the 
us naval academy and served for five years including aboard the 
aircraft carrier uss lexington but was forced to retire because of 
ill health 
he moved to los angeles unsuccessfully ran for the state 
legislature and wrote his first story lifeline selling it for 
70 to astounding magazine 
asimov said he and heinlein served together in philadelphia 
during world war ii and formed a close friendship which never 
entirely broke up 
robert heinlein has been writing science fiction now for 48 
years and from the very start he was recognized as a grand 
master recalled asimov in 1975 the science fiction writers of 
america set up just such an award and he was the first to get it 
there was no argument much like george washington becoming 
the first president 
asimov said his favorite bit of heinlein writing was the opening 
to door into summer a story about time travel in which he 
described a cat better than anyone has ever described a cat 
the work that impressed me the most was solution 
unsatisfactory written before the manhattan project in which he 
accurately described the current nuclear stalemate asimov said 
heinleins books were written in a spare matteroffact style 
but they presented readers with thoughtful questions about how life 
should be lived 
in the classic stranger in a strange land hero valentine 
michael smith is a human raised by martians but he challenged his 
home planets values with his own priorities including universal 
free love nudity and many sexual encounters he also 
discorporated or made disappear authority figures he felt were 
evil 
in methuselahs children and in later books character 
lazarus long offers this aphorism on how to get a man to help you 
never appeal to a mans better nature he may not have one 
invoking his selfinterest gives you more leverage 
in addition to the water bed another heinlein invention in 
common use is known as a waldo for the handicapped hero of the 
short story of that title waldo invented remotecontrolled robot 
arms that are used in a variety of delicate and hazardous 
manufacturing processes 
two years ago he told writer eric hoffman that writers dont 
know how to retire and said he stuck with science fiction because 
he did it well and because it sold 
heinlein is survived by his wife virginia they had no children

republican voters decide two hardfought primary battles today 
as nebraska rep hal daub seeks to deny sen david karnes a shot at 
election and millionaire john raese tries to derail west virginia 
gov arch moores bid for a record fourth term 
also in west virginia senate majority leader robert byrd faces 
a littleknown opponent as he seeks the democratic nomination for a 
sixth term 
nebraskas gop senate primary has become a bitter and divisive 
contest as well as a close one an omaha worldherald poll last 
week showed karnes backed by 41 percent of those interviewed while 
daub was supported by 40 percent nineteen percent were undecided 
and the margin of error was 4 points 
daub a 47yearold fourterm congressman has accused karnes of 
being a rubber stamp for gov kay orr and president reagan and 
of flipflopping on votes including the trade bill and last 
years highway bill 
karnes 39 was a key supporter of mrs orrs 1986 election 
campaign but otherwise a political unknown when she appointed him 
in march 1987 to fill the seat left vacant by the death of 
democratic sen edward zorinsky 
the last us senator defeated in a primary was florida democrat 
richard stone who lost in a runoff oct 7 1980 to bill gunter 
gunter was defeated that november by republican paula hawkins 
in nebraskas democratic primary the overwhelming favorite is 
bob kerrey the popular 44yearold former governor he faces ken 
michaelis a 45yearold disbarred lawyer 
in west virginia moore must overcome a wellfinanced campaign 
by raese as well as a lastminute televised report linking him to 
corruption in mingo county 
the nbc report broadcast sunday quoted former county political 
boss johnie owens as saying that in 1972 moore offered him 12000 
to include his name on a list of recommended candidates when moore 
was running for his second term as governor a moore spokesman 
called the report a piece of garbage and raese said he was 
saddened by the whole event 
raese 38 maintains the state is in perilous financial shape 
and claims moore made just 10 percent of 385 million in budget 
cuts recommended by the governors task force on waste management 
moore 65 has taken credit for cutting taxes by 311 million 
during the past four years although he fought most of the cuts 
when they were imposed by the legislaturehe also says he has 
brought new businesses and 30000 jobs to the state although the 
total number of working west virginians has increased by just 5700 
since 1985 
raese who inherited much of his wealth has a reputation as a 
rich kid who loves fast boats and hard living he lost to 
another millionaire jay rockefeller in his first try for office 
in the 1984 senate race 
the last governor to lose a primary was edwin w edwards a 
louisiana democrat who finished second in a nonpartisan open 
primary last october to fellow democrat charles e buddy 
roemer iii instead of forcing a runoff edwards withdrew from the 
race 
in 1986 gov william j sheffield of alaska lost the democratic 
primary to stephen c cowper who won the election in november 
seven democrats are seeking their partys nomination for west 
virginia governor but the race has been dominated by a bitter war 
of negative tv ads between former house of delegates speaker clyde 
see and charleston insurance executive gaston caperton 
see has criticized capertons refusal to sign a voluntary 
campaign spending limit and pointed out that a study found a 25 
percent error rate in state claims processed by capertons 
insurance company the company handles the state employee insurance 
system 
caperton has responded by saying he built the nations 18th 
largest insurance company and accused see of engaging in 
oldstyle politics and a dirty campaign full of distortion 
byrd 71 is opposed in the democratic primary by huntington 
moving company owner bob myers byrd says he will give up the 
majority leaders job to become senate appropriations committee 
chairman if he is reelected and democrats retain control of the 
senate 
in the gop senate primary state sen jay wolfe is expected to 
defeat bernie lumbert of buckhannon a welfare recipient

danes voted today in a parliamentary 
election seen as a referendum on denmarks commitment to nato 
polls opened at 9 am for the 39 million eligible voters and 
close 11 hours later reliable projections of the results were 
expected at 10 pm 
three independent surveys predicted little change from the 
results of the previous election last september with modest gains 
possible for a rightist fringe group 
it was the first election since world war ii to be contested 
over foreign policy or security issues the danes have voted 19 
times in 43 years a european record 
conservative prime minister poul schlueter heading a 
centerright coalition called for the vote after he failed to 
block a motion in parliament last month toughening denmarks 
antinuclear stance 
this election is a referendum on nato schlueter said in a 
newspaper interview on monday the snap election comes just eight 
months after schlueter suffered setbacks in a previous ballot 
if implemented the resolution would require notification be 
sent to visiting warships of denmarks 31yearold peacetime ban on 
nuclear weapons in its territory until now denmark has been 
satisfied with a general policy statement 
the resolution was seen as a challenge to natos policy of 
keeping a nuclear option us and british ships as a matter of 
policy refuse to say whether they are nuclear armed 
britain has said a danish policy shift could affect natos 
capability for emergency reinforcement of this strategic country 
which controls access to the baltic sea 
the social democrats who sponsored the resolution deny they 
are antinato but say denmark cannot be intimidated by natos 
nuclear powers into compromising on its antinuclear policy 
twelve parties are in the race for the 179member folketing but 
a party must surpass a 2 percent threshhold to win a seat in the 
legislature nine parties are in the current house 
schlueters fourparty coalition controls 70 seats the 
opposition alliance of social democrats and the socialist peoples 
party has 81 seats 
the balance of power is held by the socialliberal party with 
11 seats which backs the governments domestic policy and supports 
the oppositions foreign policy 
preelection polls forecast another stalemate with only the 
farright progress party showing gains from the nine seats it now 
holds the party advocates deep tax cuts less bureaucracy and 
restricting immigration and it is shunned by all the mainstream 
politicians 
also in the outgoing parliament are the fourseat leftist fringe 
party common course and four representatives from the autonomous 
territories of greenland and the faroe islands 
schlueter said he expected a long period of postelection 
haggling to form a workable coaltion and that he hoped for a broad 
alliance that would command a majority in parliament he did not 
rule out a partnership with the social democrats denmarks largest 
party

hour monday i will never regret however growing up in the

those proceedings reportedly centered on ms hahns former boss 
the rev gene profeta of the full gospel tabernacle in massapequa 
and whether his church violated state tax laws 
ms hahn said the questions she was asked were very 
predictable with a few surprises she said because she was sworn 
to secrecy she could not elaborate 
ms hahn declined to confirm if profeta was the target of the 
investigation but acknowledged that she was asked about him 
naturally i would be i worked with the man almost all my 
life she said 
in october ms hahn said in a statement following her testimony 
before the albany grand jury that she turned to reverend profeta 
for comfort and support after her sexual encounter with bakker in 
1980 
she later became secretary to the church headed by profeta her 
pastor since she was 14 profetas church turned out to be a 
world just as disturbed as that of bakker and the ptl 
according to her statement 
bakker left the financially troubled television ministry in 
march 1987 after disclosures of the sexual encounter her 
earlier monday ms hahn told reporters that her life has been 
threatened repeatedly and that very important papers were 
stolen from her long island apartment during the past year 
a lot of important things are missing she said the 
entire story from the ptl on 
her attorney dominic barbara said ms hahn lost documents 
agreements canceled checks contracts neither he nor ms hahn 
elaborated about the theft

despite misgivings among officials about 
honoring a nazi airship a historical marker now designates the 
spot where the hindenburg exploded and crashed 51 years ago 
killing 36 people 
there was some political hesitancy ocean county freeholder 
george buckwald said after mondays dedication but we felt it 
was time to forget the politics and view it as an historic 
occasion 
several hundred people gathered for a ceremony last year marking 
the 50th anniversary of the crash the freeholders county 
supervisors paid for a marker at the site a field at what is now 
the naval air engineering center 
the plaque was to be dedicated friday the 51st anniversary of 
the may 6 1937 tragedy but the service was postponed by rain 
until monday the 52nd anniversary of the hindenburgs first flight 
into the united states 
the bronze marker set in pink granite is surrounded by a 
concrete walkway in an elliptical shape similar to the hindenburgs 
outline several dozen people attended the dedication ceremony 
its a navy tradition that when we make a ship a memorial we 
put a plaque on the bridge said capt james r macdonald 
commanding officer at the engineering center in this spot is 
where the bridge or the control car on the hindenburg came to 
rest 
they should have done this a long time ago said john 
iannaccone who was in the hindenburgs ground crew on the fateful 
day everybody who comes here wants to know where it happened 
now they can see where it happened 
iannaccone and several others at the dedication brought small 
pieces of the 804foot hindenburgs charred aluminum alloy frame 
the hindenburg was filled with highly flammable hydrogen instead 
of fireproof helium a rare commodity that the us government 
would not willingly share with germany 
investigations indicated the probable cause of the explosion was 
a hydrogen leak in the aft part of the ship complicated by 
thunderstorms and static discharge from the landing lines dragging 
on the ground below 
nick grand a spokesman for the naval air engineering center 
said final details have not been worked out on allowing the public 
onto the secured base to see the memorial

ten representatives of the 
nicaraguan rebels met along the hondurannicaraguan border to try 
to iron out divisions within their organization a rebel spokesman 
said 
the meeting involved unidentified civilian and military members 
of the nicaraguan resistance the principal rebel umbrella 
organization who were interested in bringing about the cohesion 
of our forces said boscos matamoros a resistance spokesman 
in a telephone interview with the associated press matamoros 
said none of the resistance directors participated in the meeting 
matamoros also denied published reports that a group of contras 
as the usbacked rebels are known have been holed up in a 
honduran base camp since saturday and were refusing to take orders 
from the resistance leadership 
a report in todays editions of the washington post said that 
between 1500 and 3000 rebels were mounting a rebellion at a base 
camp in yamales a tiny honduran village about three miles from the 
nicaraguan border 
according to the post the reported rebellion was being led by 
diogenes hernandez membreno a contra military commander 
there is no rebellion everything that says there is one is 
false matamoros said there are only differences in criteria 
as occurs in any democratic movement 
in san jose costa rica a contra official closely tied to the 
resistance directorate also denied there had been an uprising 
we cannot deny that there have been problems in our ranks but 
it is my understanding that the situation is under control and that 
all combatants are willing to obey the established authorities 
the source told the ap speaking on condition that he not be 
identified 
he confirmed there were about 3000 rebel guerrillas in yamales 
matamoros declined to comment on the results of sundays 
meeting which he said lasted over two hours he did say that 
hernandez membreno was at the session 
we are acting in a democratic manner in which there always are 
differences of opinion matamoros said nevertheless the 
situation will be resolved very soon 
matamoros said none of those at the meeting was opposed to the 
march 23 ceasefire plan signed by contra leaders and 
representatives of nicaraguas leftist sandinista goverment 
the contra official in san jose however said there is 
discontent among a group of our combatants who do not agree with 
the accords and this has created the crisis that exists at the 
moment 
seven highlevel contras were expelled from honduras on friday 
after demanding the firing of their chief col enrique bermudez 
who reportedly opposes the peace agreement 
they accused bermudez of corruption and of surrounding himself 
with supporters of the late nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza 
debayle who was ousted when a popular revolution brought the 
sandinistas to power in 1979 
the contra source confirmed hernandez membreno was among those 
seeking bermudezs ouster 
he said the infighting over bermudezs role had seriously 
divided the resistance directorate as well with one axis formed 
by aristides sanchez and alfredo cesar who support bermudez and 
another axis formed by adolfo calero azucena ferrey and pedro 
chamorro who want to replace the colonel 
the source said that bermudez and the directorate members were 
summoned to washington last week where secretary of state george 
p shultz urged them to settle their differences 
as a result of that meeting the source said the directorate 
members are seriously talking to resolve their differences over 
the military and political leadership of our forces

an escaped killer who eluded 
authorities for five weeks living in the rugged hills in a leanto 
and eating groundhog was captured when his sprint to flee 
searchers was slowed by a dog hed befriended 
tommie mollohan 45 who was serving a life term for the 1973 
robbery and murder of a grocer was caught monday following a 
twohour chase that one officer likened to a deer chase 
mollohan was the last to be recaptured of three murderers who 
escaped april 3 from the west virginia penitentiary he was trapped 
on a remote heavily wooded ridge about 25 miles from the prison 
state police said 
police said mollohan relied on his outdoors savvy to remain free 
five weeks but he also befriended a dog and the pet slowed him 
down during mondays chase 
he had the dog tied up on a makeshift leash of string and 
led it along while running but mollohan finally released the 
beagle when it had trouble keeping up said trooper sp singleton 
the dog followed him and was with him when we caught him 
singleton said 
local police state conservation officers and authorities with 
tracking dogs chased mollohan up one thickly wooded ridge and down 
another 
the escapee carried a dismantled 22 caliber rifle in a garbage 
bag but ditched it during the pursuit singleton said 
finally we got him coralled in there and he jumped up in front 
of a local police officer singleton said he gave himself up 
i think mostly he was tired 
we almost would have lost him again if he had headed up 
another ridge singleton said he said he knew that but lost 
his bearings 
mollohan had been seen in the area before but had evaded 
searchers 
a resident reported seeing mollohan sunday night and about six 
troopers searched the woods until 130 am before going home 
then we got another call this morning and were looking in the 
woods for only five to 10 minutes when he bolted up the hill the 
chase was on singleton said 
mollohan weighed about 230 pounds when he escaped from prison 
but lost between 45 and 65 pounds while free singleton said 
he had to eat groundhog and lived in a leanto police said 
aside from being tired after the strenuous chase however 
mollohan appeared to be in good shape the trooper said 
hes got some scratches but thats it you wouldnt think 
there was anything wrong with him the way he ran up that hill this 
morning singleton said a regular guy couldnt have done it 
mollohan faces administrative escape charges but singleton said 
criminal escape charges likely would be dropped hes already 
serving life what more could we do 
penitentiary officials described mollohan as the mastermind of 
the april escape by the three murderers all of whom were serving 
life sentences without chance of parole 
bobby dean stacy 35 was arrested april 14 in columbus ohio 
at the apartment of a friend where he was hiding in a closet 
stacy had been convicted of killing a huntington police officer 
david williams 28 was caught late last month in mercer county 
where he was riding in a pickup truck with his brother williams 
was convicted of murder and other charges in the december 1980

directly affected by the drought which has dried up many of 
hubeis reservoirs and smaller rivers 
temperatures in the province have hovered around 100 degrees 
the paper said 
officials said farmers have been unable to plant onethird of

the water level of the yangtze river the source of

a leading chinese economist today said china has 
reached a crossroads that can lead either to the prosperity of 
greater reform or the dangers of a return to sovietstyle state 
planning 
li yining dean of the economic management department at beijing 
university said he feared backsliding in chinas 10yearold 
program of marketoriented reforms as the nation tries to cope with 
rising inflation and serious supplydemand imbalances 
the danger now is not price rises or the education system 
he said at a foreign correspondents club of beijing news 
conference the danger is that the need to stabilize the economic 
situation will be used to bring back the traditional system 
li an outspoken proponent of stock ownership of staterun 
enterprises said the traditional system was the sovietstyle 
command economy which china followed until senior leader deng 
xiaoping started introducing market principles in 1978 
li said there is general commitment to reform at the state 
level but enterprises at the local level only know the old ways 
and find it hard to change 
the government he said needs to improve its propaganda work 
we must tell ordinary people that in the past they had stable 
prices under conditions of poverty 
a surge in retail prices in the past year has dampened 
enthusiasm among some government leaders for pushing ahead with 
reforms and has given rise to theme of maintaining economic 
stability 
in the first quarter of this year the government said retail 
prices rose 11 percent compared to the same period in 1987 while 
food prices were up 179 percent 
asked about the policies of premier li peng who is regarded as 
favoring greater stability and a slower pace of reform li said he 
agreed with the premiers statement that increasing supply is the 
best way to correct supplydemand imbalances 
to do this the economist said we must readjust the structure 
of enterprises stimulate the activities of labor and promote the 
flow of productive factors 
li said however that china cannot rush into reforms of its 
statecontrolled pricing system which has led to shortages of 
goods and failed to meet rising consumer demand 
complete decontrol of prices would fuel inflation and lead to a 
run on bank deposits because price rises would outstrip bank 
interest rates price reforms should be carried out over a 
sixtoeight year period he said 
li said he supported recent moves by the government to end price 
controls on pork vegetables and other nonstaple food items and 
replace them with direct subsidies to urban consumers 
china which kept prices virtually unchanged during the first 30 
years of communist rule shouldnt be afraid of small price 
rises li said 
li who spent six years in labor reform camps during the 196676 
cultural revolution for questioning sovietstyle state planning 
said prosperity in china depends on changing systems of ownership 
letting the value of most goods be determined by the market and 
making entrepreneurs and family farmers the backbone of the economy 
socialism he said must be based on a commodity or market 
economy as long as the economy prospers and living standards are 
raised our purpose is fulfilled people will see that socialism is 
not connected with poverty but wealth 
li envisioned three types of stock markets for enterprises one 
where shares could be traded only among public enterprises one 
where employees would hold and trade shares and one open to anyone 
asked about the need for democratic reforms to accompany changes 
in the economy li said socialist democracy like socialist 
realism cant develop overnight as long as we are moving in the 
right direction it is fine 
in china he said many things are irrational but we cant 
just get rid of them

world opinion has produced reforms in the soviet 
unions use of psychiatric hospitalization for political 
repression but the policy seems to be continuing despite glasnost 
a dissident soviet psychiatrist says 
although many dissidents have been released from psychiatric 
hospitals a substantial number remain said anatoly koryagin 
and a wellpublicized new set of official guidelines on 
hospitalizing psychiatric patients makes no substantial difference 
he said 
it allows a very broad opportunity for any citizen to be 
forcibly taken for an examination at the request of police 
employers coworkers or neighbors he said 
koryagin who was allowed to leave the soviet union after 
spending six years in prison for publicizing psychiatric abuses 
lives in switzerland he spoke to reporters monday through an 
interpreter at the annual meeting of the american psychiatric 
association 
a recent conversation with a soviet contact found 20 to 25 
welldocumented cases of unjust confinement in psychiatric 
hospitals but that is only a minute portion of the total 
number he said 
various groups that monitor the problem estimate that 500 people 
are in soviet psychiatric hospitals because of political or 
religious activities or for organizing labor unions or speaking 
out against conditions in the workplace said ellen mercer 
director of international affairs for the american psychiatric 
organization 
as a result of soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness the soviet press has begun to write about the 
unjust hospitalizations but koryagin said the coverage tries to 
make them sound like bureaucratic oversights or medical 
incompetence rather than an official policy 
he also said dissidents who have been released from psychiatric 
hospitals still carry a diagnosis of mental illness and must 
register at local mental health centers 
although soviet authorities say millions of names will be 
removed from local registers that only means the people will not 
be regarded as needing psychiatric help any longer he said 
no official recognition will be given to the fact that the 
diagnosis was erroneous and politically motivated in the cases of 
dissidents and as a result they will not be rehabilitated legally 
and socially he said

rival shiite moslem militias fortified 
their positions or brought in reinforcements today taking 
advantage of a lull in fighting that came after syria warned the 
fourday carnage must stop 
police said no casualties were reported overnight from the 
confrontations in the slums of south beirut 
the fighting which had simmered down to sporadic gunfire by 
this morning has killed 154 people and wounded 367 since it broke 
out friday the casualty toll included 65 people killed and 50 
wounded on monday 
police said 36 syrian officers moved into the area with six 
committees in an effort to implement a truce in fighting between 
the prosyrian amal militia and the iranianbacked hezbollah or 
party of god 
the battle for control of beiruts southern slums where an 
estimated 250000 shiites live raised fears about the fate of 18 
foreign hostages they include nine americans and most are believed 
held by hezbollahaffiliated kidnappers in the 16squaremile 
shiite enclave 
the committees each of which has a syrian officer an iranian 
embassy official a representative of amal and another of hezbollah 
set up truce observation posts in the slums before dawn a police 
spokesman said 
the committees are trying to convince the warring factions to 
observe a ceasefire as a first step said the spokesman who 
cannot be identified in line with standing regulations 
a threepoint proposal announced monday calls for a truce 
withdrawal of gunmen from streets and return of the warring 
factions to positions they controlled before the fighting began he 
said 
hezbollah which has gained control of half of south beirut in 
the clashes rejects the return to prefriday positions he 
said 
hezbollah gunmen the spokesman said were using the relative 
lull to barricade their positions with high earth mounds in the 
densely populated districts of ghobeiri bir elabed hay madi and 
mesharafiyeh 
amal which controls all gateways to the disputed south beirut 
was bringing in reinforcements he said 
amal militiamen according to the spokesman controlled the 
districts of haret hreik mreiji roweiss shiyah and kasskass 
it appears that both sides are preparing for another round of 
fighting he said 
many of the estimated 250000 residents of south beirut also 
appeared convinced that another round of fighting is yet to come 
the spokesman said scores of civilians carrying clothes and 
other personal belongings left the embattled areas overnight to 
safer places in syrianpoliced west beirut he said about 60 
percent of south beiruts residents already have evacuated the 
disputed area 
ahmed kurdi an associated press photo technician was trapped 
with his wife and six children friday in a shelter in bir elabed 
but escaped monday 
shells rained nonstop around us he said kids screamed 
and there was no way to comfort them or feed them when fighting 
abated for a short time kurdi said i told my wife this is our 
chance to get out we did dodging sniper fire as we ran out of 
bir elabed 
the thunder of shellfire rolled over the city all day and into 
the night gunmen atop racing ambulances fired into the air to 
clear traffic so the wounded could reach hospitals radio stations 
appealed for blood donations 
doctors confirmed allegations by both sides that wounded 
fighters were dragged from ambulances and hospitals and slaughtered 
by their rivals 
syria has 25000 soldiers in lebanon including 7500 in moslem 
west beirut it is the main power broker after 13 years of civil 
war but is being challenged by iran which the syrians support in 
its 8yearold war with iraq 
fighting eased as the committees drove into the slums but 
sporadic bursts of cannon and machinegun fire echoed in the region 
well into the night 
lebanons 12 million shiites are its largest sect with syrias 
blessing amal crushed hezbollah last month in predominantly shiite 
south lebanon the fourday battle cost 62 lives and 150 people 
were wounded

leaders of hungarys increasingly 
divided communist party met today to discuss reforms that critics 
say do not go far enough to solve the nations serious economic 
problems 
the central committee meeting is a prelude to a national party 
conference on may 20 where the future of party leader janos kadar 
may be debated 
kadar who is almost 76 has led the party since moscow crushed 
an antisoviet revolution in 1956 while he pioneered reforms that 
made hungary relatively prosperous in the late 1960s and 1970s 
kadar now is increasingly blamed for the countrys economic crisis 
premier karoly grosz a leading contender to succeed kadar has 
fueled speculation about kadars future by saying that the laws 
of biology also apply to politicians an apparent reference to 
kadars age 
grosz visited britain last week and told reporters that todays 
central committee meeting will elect a committee to make proposals 
on party personnel changes those proposals are to be reviewed at 
another central committee meeting after the twoday party 
conference 
in the event that some 1000 delegates attending the 
conference decide that personnel changes are necessary and if 
these changes include the person of janos kadar he will accept the 
decision grosz was quoted as saying on the state news agency mti 
on friday 
kadar has said he would step aside if asked but he has given no 
signal that he intends to relinquish control of the hungarian 
socialist workers party any time soon last month four of the 
most outspoken reformist communists were abruptly expelled from the 
party a sign that kadar and the partys old guard still have clout 
articles in the staterun media and a fierce debate over how 
much political pluralism to allow in hungary testify to the 
increasing turmoil in party ranks 
a draft policy paper for the may 20 conference proposes some 
political reforms including secret ballots multicandidate party 
elections and limited terms of office for party officials 
but critics say the proposals while allowing for a wider choice 
in party elections make no provision for genuine pluralism and 
emphasize the need for communists to stick rigidly to party policy 
when making public statements 
the latter requirement is seen by some observers as an attack on 
imre pozsgay an outspoken central committee member and leading 
proponent of change 
he has called for changes in the constitution that would provide 
for referendums guarantee the independence of interest groups and 
review the partys role in hungarys changing society 
there is a need to rethink the whole structure of socialism 
pozsgay said in a recent interview in the magyar nemzet daily 
pozsgay who heads the communistsponsored patriotic peoples 
front an umbrella organization for the party unions and social 
groups has said there will be no real change in hungary without 
political reforms that renewed public consensus 
the reformers arguments that political change is essential to 
longterm economic progress have been bolstered in recent months by 
continued economic crisis with a gross foreign debt of more than 
17 billion this nation of 106 million people has eastern 
europes highest per capita debt 
inflation is running at more than 15 percent and official 
economists say unemployment may reach 200000 by 1990 if austerity 
measures imposed by grosz force unprofitable state firms to close

a panamanian official said a decision 
by the us ambassador to have his chartered panamanian plane fly 
to an american air base reportedly because of security concerns 
constituted a hijacking 
maj pascual gonzalez director of the panamanian civil 
aeronautics board also told a news conference monday that a 
relative of panamas ousted civilian president was aboard the plane 
the us embassy said us ambassador arthur davis made the 
decision after he saw panamanian security men arguing with his own 
security detail on the tarmac at the small civilian paitilla 
airport on sunday 
it was a judgment call an embassy statement said the 
ambassadors security detail made the judgment that the situation 
at paitilla was not a good environment 
the plane remained sunday night at howard air base in the former 
panama canal zone about five miles from panama city 
gonzalez told reporters that the plane failed to follow 
necessary procedures for a civilian aircraft to land at a 
military base and spend the night there 
gonzalez said us officials refused to provide any information 
about the plane after it landed at the air base the planes owner 
hugo giraud told the news conference the embassy had not informed 
him his plane was at howard 
as far as we are concerned until we conclude the 
investigation the plane was hijacked or stolen gonzalez 
declared 
he said that gabriel lewis galindo jr soninlaw of former 
president eric arturo delvalle and the son of an opposition leader 
were also on the plane 
delvalle has been in hiding in panama since his dismissal feb 
26 a day after he tried to fire gen manuel antonio noriega 
noriega commander of panamas 15000member defense forces and the 
power behind the civilian government was indicted in the united 
states on drug trafficking charges 
the reagan administration continues to recognize delvalle as 
panamas legitimate president and has demanded that noriega resign 
the incident sunday was the second apparent attempt by 
panamanian security to interfere with the ambassadors movements 
on april 3 a military vehicle tried to stop davis limousine as he 
left the vatican ambassadors residence 
in another development hundreds of people waited in line at 
banks on monday to cash checks and make other withdrawals for the 
first time in nine weeks although there were limits on how much 
they could take out 
no withdrawals had been allowed since march 3 at some banks 
longer because of runs on deposits and a severe cash shortage 
prompted in part by us economic sanctions against panama those 
sanctions have frozen 50 million in panamanian government funds at 
us banks 
mondays step came only after bankers reluctantly agreed to a 
government plan to reopen with restrictions on withdrawals new 
rules issued by the governments national banking commission limit 
withdrawals from checking accounts to 25 percent of the balance on 
march 3 up to a maximum of 10000 
some customers said they were able to cash checks as large as 
1600 while others came away emptyhanded because the available 
balance from the account that issued the check already had been 
withdrawn 
the us embassy said the panamanian agents at paitilla airport 
were armed with m16 rifles and shotguns and demanded passports and 
other documents it said their manner was considered hostile 
an embassy official said the aircraft remained at howard because 
a new flight plan must be filed before it could be flown out 
davis and his party were returning sunday from a day at the 
contadora resort island

a jury began deliberations in the trial of 
reputed mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo and eight 
codefendants accused of conspiracy and murder in the 1984 murder 
of a rival 
the jury spent two hours in deliberations monday before 
returning to their hotel deliberations were to resume today 
police allege that scarfo 59 ran the areas mafia from his 
home in atlantic city nj before his arrest in an unrelated 
extortion case in 1986 
he and the other eight defendants were being tried for the sept 
14 1984 murder of salvatore testa testas body with two bullets 
in the head was found trussed and wrapped in a blanket in a wooded 
area of southern new jersey 
the jury got the case monday after closing arguments from scarfo 
attorney robert simone who attacked two former gangsters who were 
key prosecution witnesses and assistant district attorney barbara 
christie 
ms christie conceded that the informants nicholas nicky 
crow caramandi and thomas delgiorno were despicable men who 
talked only after they had been marked for death 
rats yes but when you enter a sewer dont rats lead the 
way ms christie said in mobrelated killings the 
commonwealth of pennsyvlania doesnt have the luxury of witnesses 
like winston churchill and martin luther king 
delgiorno and caramandi werent members of the knights of 
columbus but of a secret vicious underworld mob an organization 
where killing was part of the power they told you that nicky 
scarfo was the boss and that scarfos organization eliminated 
problems and dissension by simple execution she said 
the informants testified that scarfo gave the order to kill 
testa because testa was threatening scarfos control of the mob and 
because testa broke his engagement to the daughter of one of 
scarfos top lieutenants 
attorney oscar goodman who represents scarfo nephew philip 
leonetti identified during the trial as the mobs underboss said 
the defense was confident of acquittal 
we feel very very good about it goodman said 
ms christie and simone were more cautious 
i never think about it until they the jury tell me she 
said 
simone said i never feel confident when the case is in the 
jurys hands but im hopeful 
the trial began more than two months ago 
caramandi and delgiorno testified testa was murdered in a closed 
south philadelphia candy store caramandi said testa was lured by 
his best friend joseph pungitore of philadelphia to the store 
where salvatore wayne grande of philadelphia pumped two bullets 
into testas head 
the two witnesses said testas body was transported in a van to 
new jersey where it was dumped along a road 
besides scarfo leonetti of margate nj grande and pungitore 
the other defendants are salvatore merlino of ventnor nj and 
philadelphians francis iannarella salvatore scafidi joseph grande 
and charles iannece 
scarfo also faces charges in two other murders 
last year he was convicted of conspiring with a former city 
councilman to extort 1 million from a waterfront developer he is 
serving a 14year prison sentence on that conviction

a federal judge slapped us agriculture 
secretary richard lyng with a contempt of court citation for not 
abiding by an antisex discrimination agreement stemming from a 
15yearold lawsuit 
us district judge samuel conti on monday also ordered the us 
forest service to stop discriminating against women in california 
conti took the action as a result of the lawsuit originally 
filed by equal rights advocates a california publicinterest law 
firm on behalf of gene bernardi a female forest service 
sociologist in berkeley 
bernardi who eventually left the forest service said she was 
denied advancement because she was a woman 
the case was expanded in 1977 to cover all of the services 
approximately 1800 women employees throughout the state 
a 1981 consent decree called for the forest service to end 
discrimination and upgrade female employees over a fiveyear period 
equal rights advocates returned to court last summer saying the 
decree had not been followed 
federal magistrate claudia wilken agreed saying that less than 
half of 162 provisions in the agreement had been complied with she 
recommended a threeyear extension of the decree and establishment 
of a 15 million fund to implement it and a 360000 fund to 
monitor it 
contis rulings which incorporated wilkens recommendations 
make official an agreement reached in march in which the government 
agreed to halt job bias against women in the forest service 
lawyers for lyng who has been agriculture secretary for two 
years have said the agreement will not be contested 
its a very clear message in terms of putting the department 
of agriculture on notice and the department of justice on notice 
said gail kaufman executive director of equal rights advocates 
kaufman contended that the agriculture department had tried in 
the past 18 months to stop sex bias and to adopt various employment 
goals and timetables but the justice department basically pulled 
the rug out from under them because of its own antiaffirmative 
action stance

an antiapartheid newspaper 
made fun of a government official after it was ordered to cease 
publication under the countrys emergency censorship regulations 
an order in the official government gazette monday said south a 
cape townbased newspaper with a multiracial readership will be 
banned until june 10 
south normally publishes thursday but in anticipation of the 
ban it published a special edition monday that included a 
frontpage likeness of home affairs minister stoffel botha in 
battle armor wielding an axe 
the censorship regulations empower botha to close publications 
he considers subversive for renewable threemonth periods his 
actions cannot be challenged in court 
at the root of the problem is apartheid and exploitation 
said an editorial in souths special edition we did not create 
the situation we are only reporting it and it is this ugly truth 
that the government cant stomach 
south serves a readership of about 15000 primarily in the cape 
town area it was founded in march 1987 with funds from european 
church groups 
its editor rashid seria said at a news conference last month 
that south had lost about 15000 since it began publishing 
in march botha imposed a threemonth ban on new nation a 
militant blackoriented weekly with a national circulation of more 
than 50000 five other publications have been warned that they 
face possible closure 
the paper believed to be next in line for possible banning is 
the weekly mail with a predominantly white readership and strong 
support among liberal politicians journalists and business 
executives the newspapers editors are trying to mobilize a 
campaign to save it and other threatened publications 
the current stateofemergency expires june 11 south could be 
banned for an additional two months if as expected the emergency 
is extended for another year 
seria speaking to reporters after the ban was issued said 
21500 copies of the special edition were printed he said it was 
possible the government might demand that the issues be recalled 
souths board of trustees which includes the the rev allan 
boesak issued a statement saying it was sheer madness for the 
government to ban newspapers rather than address south africas 
political problems 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in south 
africa the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs and 
the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate 
districts schools and health services

maria desillers imprudently spent at least 
200000 in donations for her late sons care on herself and 
friends including more than 30000 for jewelry clothing and a 
luxury car says a courtappointed curator 
in documents filed monday in dade county circuit court karen 
gievers gave the most detailed account yet of how money for ms 
desillers son ronnie was spent 
ms desillers spent 44359 to help other children needing 
transplants according to bank records 
the rest of the money appears to have been spent 
imprudently for inappropriate reasons without proper 
authorization wrote ms gievers an attorney appointed to 
oversee ronnies estate 
her son ronnie 7 died at childrens hospital of pittsburgh in 
april 1987 while awaiting a fourth liver transplant his plight 
captured the nations attention and donations poured in from across 
the country including 1000 from president reagan 
ms desillers was scheduled to appear in dade county circuit 
court today to contest charges by the florida secretary of state in 
a related case that she violated state charity laws by using 
donations to pay for personal expenses 
ms desillers has repeatedly denied the allegations she said 
she used much of the cash withdrawals to promote organdonor 
awareness and gave money away to people with problems 
according to the documents ms desillers made cash withdrawals 
of 96526 and gave 23700 to her exboyfriend for business losses 
and 7284 to her exhusband for car payments and expenses for his 
daughter from a previous marriage 
records also show that ms desillers withdrew 6134 from the 
account for her brother and 750 for her exboyfriends mother 
while ms desillers has clearly suffered from the great 
personal tragedy of her sons death she appears to have ignored 
the laws when it suited her purposes to do so ms gievers 
wrote in her preliminary report on the estates assets 
almost 300000 of the 527000 that remained in ronnies 
account when he died has been spent according to court documents 
about 243500 remains in the estate 
ms gievers is asking the court to return any remaining money to 
creditors and give the rest to other children who need transplants 
a hearing is expected next month 
her attorney harry robbins said ms desillers frequently paid 
back friends and family members who had given her financial 
assistance when ronnie was ill 
in november the pittsburgh hospital sued ms desillers after 
she refused to pay the a 262000 balance from her sons 
operations ms desillers has charged that ronnie received poor 
care but hospital officials have denied it 
the documents filed monday show that ms desillers bought 
10850 in jewelry and 5797 in clothing she used 3163 from 
donations for furniture 13500 for a 1985 bmw and 1700 for 
rent at her miami bayfront apartment according to records

a maintenance engineer apparently bypassed a 
safety system during last weeks skyscraper blaze and died when he 
stopped an elevator manually at a fireengulfed floor so hot that 
the elevator door partly melted a city official said 
the citys chief elevator inspector harvey ledesma said monday 
that the elevators in the 62story first interstate bank building 
did not malfunction during the wednesday blaze that gutted the 
buildings 12th through 16th floors 
however he said one person died and others suffered close calls 
when they bypassed the elevators fire safety system allowing them 
to stop on or near fireengulfed floors forty people were hurt in 
the blaze in the states tallest building 
they the elevators all did what theyre supposed to do 
ledesma said 
meanwhile fire officials said the cause of the blaze remains 
undetermined but added that arson had largely been ruled out they 
said however that the fire destroyed many clues to the cause 
earlier battalion chief gary bowie downplayed speculation that 
the banks planned sale of its securities unit played a role in the 
blaze that injured 40 people no one interviewed has said that 
theres a possibility of an incendiary fire of any type he said 
bowie and bank officials said the fire apparently started on the 
12th floor near a computer center where recent electrical work was 
performed 
ledesma who inspected the buildings 33 elevators monday said 
the elevators serving the fire floors were activated by heat 
sensors which sent them to the main floor 
but he said the only person killed maintenance engineer john 
handy and other maintenance workers in the building bypassed this 
safety system 
handy 24 boarded elevator no 33 and using a special fire 
key went to the 12th floor where he died almost immediately 
ledesma said handy after reaching the 12th floor had to push 
an open button that allowed the door to remain open until a 
close button is pushed 
ledesma said he found the fires intense heat had partially 
melted the door of the elevator in which handy died 
the fire key was melted into the on position he said 
he said other building maintenance workers using elevators in 
attempts to escape the flames must have activated independent 
service switches inside locked panels that overrode fire safety 
systems and allowed the workers to travel to floors 12 through 16 
however one worker radmila radich said the elevator safety 
system did not work properly 
ms radich 40 said that after the fire started she called for 
an elevator while working on the 19th floor simply by pressing a 
button and that the elevator promptly arrived 
then she said she and another maintenance worker pushed the 
13thfloor button where they exited into choking smoke they were 
able to crawl to safety in a stairwell

more than 700 people at least half of 
them women and children were evacuated from the golden temple 
complex today a day after security forces laid siege to the shrine 
after an exchange of gunfire that claimed five lives 
sikh extremists fired intermittently today at security posts 
around the shrine 
more than 2500 paramilitary troops and police armed with 
automatic rifles and light machine guns have encircled the 
sprawling temple complex the siege follows an exchange of fire 
between militants in the temple and paramilitary troops on monday 
in which at least five people were killed and 10 injured 
police said most of the people who left the complex today were 
devotees who became trapped inside on monday 
police searched and interrogated the men who left the temple 
at least 30 or 40 of them will turn out to be terrorists 
trying to slip away said police inspector js bhatia 
a curfew imposed on the old walled sector of the city remained 
in force for a second day police said 
sikhs began firing on security positions on the perimeter of the 
400yearold shrine monday the gunfire subsided overnight but 
resumed sporadically this morning police said 
seven indian reporters and photographers who had been in the 
shrine told the associated press that at least 100 sikh militants 
armed with chinesemade ak47 and american m16 automatic rifles 
were firing from eight to 10 bunkers within the temple complex 
the reporters and photographers who spent much of monday 
trapped in the temple as the firefight raged emerged overnight 
they said heavily fortified positions could be seen on western 
eastern and northern walls of the complex which is centered by the 
goldendomed temple that is sikhisms holiest shrine 
sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for 
more autonomy or an independent homeland for sikhs in punjab 
contending their minority sect is discriminated against by indias 
majority hindus sikhs are about 2 percent of indias population of 
780 million while hindus are 80 percent 
the confrontation began monday afternoon on the shrines western 
perimeter 
commanders of punjab state police and federally controlled 
paramilitary forces had gone to a security post on a nearby rooftop 
to view what was suspected to be the start of construction of a 
concrete bunker outside the temples western wall 
police said militants inside the shine opened fire on the 
commanders ss virk a sikh who is deputy inspector general of 
the paramilitary central reserve police force and four of his 
companions were injured police said a bullet was removed from 
virks chin 
the police opened fire on the sikh gunmen in the temple and 
heavy exchanges for more than three hours subsequently died down to 
intermittent firing 
five people were killed including two civilians and three 
militants police said 
it was the worst in a series of clashes that began shortly after 
militant sikh priest jasbir singh rode was released from federal 
custody and made the temples chief priest in march 
rode had been in custody for more than two years under the 
governments antiterrorism rules he was released in an effort by 
prime minister rajiv gandhi to placate extremist sikhs and lure 
them into negotiations 
since rodes return there have been persistent reports that the 
militants were building bunkers and firing ports in the temple 
complex 
on april 29 extremists fired on a police post near the shrine 
after security forces attempted to arrest a sikh militant the 
militant escaped under the cover fire and fled into the temple 
complex 
the army stormed the golden temple complex in june 1984 to drive 
out militants and some 1200 people were killed less than four 
months later prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated by two 
of her sikh bodyguards in revenge 
sikhism was founded 500 years ago as a peaceful alternative to 
warring islam and hinduism a later leader turned it into a warring 
religion in which all males must carry knives

transportation secretary james burnley today 
defended the seizure of a 25 million yacht for carrying less than 
a teaspoon of marijuana and said the reagan administration will 
continue to enforce its toughened seizure policy 
we didnt decide that we were going to go out and seize big 
expensive yachts over tiny bits of marijuana burnley said on 
abctvs good morning america 
what i announced a few weeks ago was if we find any illegal 
drugs on a vessel were going to seize a vessel were going to 
turn it over to customs and were going to let them make the final 
determination about whether the vessel should be returned to the 
owner or sold at auction 
the 133foot ark royal was confiscated in international waters 
off key west fla on saturday after a coast guard boarding party 
found about 10 marijuana seeds and two stems in a trash can and 
dresser drawer the crew and the coast guard said 
custody of the ship which is owned by tomima corp was turned 
over to customs service agents in key west the yachts sixmember 
crew was put ashore but not charged sunday night the vessel could 
be auctioned as forfeited property after several hearings 
authorities said 
the governments toughened policy provides for seizure of any 
vessel when any amount of illegal drugs is found previously boats 
were seized only when large amounts of drugs were found and the 
vessels were held in lieu of a fine based on the weight of the 
drugs 
weve got a massive national problem burnley said weve 
got people out there whether they own big boats or little boats 
big cars or little cars weve got people of all economic classes 
who are buying this stuff and we got to get at the demand side of 
this problem or were not ever going to be able to get it under 
control 
burnley interviewed from boston said the owner of the ship 
will be permitted to make whatever case he wishes to about why 
there were drugs found on it and customs will make the final 
determination about whether the boat is returned to the owner or 
sold at auction 
nobody will lose a boat without a hearing burnley added 
later 
but james powell national legal director of the american civil 
liberties union said the policy is violates the constitution 
whats wrong with it is the same thing thats wrong with 
shooting someone or hanging someone and then saying were going to 
give you a trial to see if your guilty powell said 
in our society we have always held that a person is innocent 
until proven guilty and the burden is on the government to prove 
someone of guilt before taking such drastic actions he said 
powell interviewed with burnley said the constitutional 
provision that prohibits the government from taking property 
without due process and thats whats happening in this case

authorities have begun an investigation into 
the whereabouts of reputed crime kingpin john digilio who has 
disappeared a week before his scheduled sentencing on a 
loansharking conviction 
authorities said monday there could be a reasonable explanation 
for digilios departure they also speculated it could be the 
result of organized crime strife or punishment for his 
outspokenness 
some officials also saw it as a possible ploy in connection with 
his approaching sentencing 
i hope hes gone fishing but i wouldnt bet my paycheck on 
it state police superintendant col clinton l pagano said 
the head of the fbis newark office john c mcginley said 
investigators had not settled on a theory and were tapping their 
street sources and law enforcement agencies for information 
digilios wife ellen filed a missing persons report saturday 
saying she had had no contact with the former boxer from bayonne 
since thursday evening 
digilios lawyer larry bronson said his client missed a friday 
meeting to discuss efforts to overturn his recent loan sharking 
conviction in morristown sentencing is set for next week 
bronson said digilio who law enforcement officials say is a 
powerful soldier in the genovese organized crime family was upbeat 
about his victory last month in a federal waterfront racketeering 
trial and was confident about overturning the state conviction 
hes not traveling bronson said he would have told 
somebody if he was traveling 
a digilio associate george weingartner said he had no idea 
where digilio was were all worried he said its just very 
strange weve been swamped with calls 
executive assistant us attorney melvin kracov who prosecuted 
the federal case said chances were 5050 digilio met with foul 
play 
pagano speculated that digilios highprofile ways may have 
angered his alleged mob superiors including reputed genovese boss 
vincent the chin gigante of old tappan 
digilio spoke freely with reporters acted as his own attorney 
in the federal trial engaged in a widely publicized courthouse 
brawl with a codefendant and has sued the federal government for 
harassment 
experience tells us that when you act like he acted youre 
not long for this world said pagano referring to others in mob 
history eliminated for talkativeness 
in contrast pagano said gigante strives to keep a low profile 
authorities say digilio was rising the same way gigante did 
through racketeering on the hudson river waterfront 
in the backdrop of digilios disappearance is evidence of 
growing tension between the genovese and gambino organized crime 
families he said 
he said gigante was aligned with former gambino boss paul 
castellano whose killing police sources have said was ordered by 
current reputed boss john gotti of new york city 
the new york daily news quoting justice department sources has 
reported that the fbi warned gotti that gigante had sanctioned a 
contract on his life 
gigante has been known to wander the streets of greenwich 
village in a bathrobe and has avoided trial through claims of 
mental incompetence digilio has used erratic behavior to delay 
trials and kracov suggested his disappearance may be a similar 
game 
one law enforcement official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity doubted that was likely because he said digilio wouldnt 
do anything to take himself off the streets where he keeps close 
tabs on his alleged illegal interests

californians who fear a devastating 
earthquake in the nations second largest city based on the 
purported prediction of 16th century seer nostradamus are falling 
prey to superstition and nonsense state emergency officials say 
the prediction is pure unadulterated bunk bill medigovich 
director of the california office of emergency services said 
monday by telephone from sacramento 
we dont want people to plan for quakes out of fear of 
predictions like this he said we want them to do it on a 
rational basis 
but hundreds of people called earthquake information hotlines 
some left the region and children expressed fear because of a vague 
prediction by nostradmus and a 1981 movie now sold on videotape 
called the man who could see tomorrow 
the film narrated by war of the worlds prankster orson 
welles claimed the french seer said the area would be wrecked by a 
huge quake this month some astrologers have said a big quake is 
most likely this week 
students at california state university san bernardino 
satirized the paranoia monday with an end of the world party at 
the student union pub complete with free death cake and 
disaster movies said cecilia mccarron of the schools student life 
office 
predictions based on clairvoyance headaches animal behavior 
astrology and other bogus methods have no basis in science and 
should be categorically disregarded said a statement released 
monday by state seismic safety commission executive director l 
thomas tobin 
the office of emergency services says a major devastating quake 
is more than 50 percent likely in southern california in the next 
25 years but if one occurs this week or month as far as the 
nostradamus prediction it will be coincidental said jim davis 
chairman of the california earthquake prediction evaluation council 
nevertheless hundreds who fear the prediction swamped phone 
lines at griffith observatory the american red cross and the 
california institute of technology 
most of these people arent kooks theyre genuinely 
frightened telling me they cant sleep theyre having nightmares 
and they dont know what to do said caltech spokesman robert 
finn 
psychologist robert butterworth said worried callers swamped the 
hotline at charter hospital of long beach he partially blamed 
revelations in a book by former white house chief of staff donald 
regan that first lady nancy reagan consulted astrologers 
elaine young a beverly hills real estate broker said she 
leased a dozen homes for people who left town for the month and 
leased another 15 to wealthy new york residents who came to 
california for the month because someone started a rumor a big 
quake would hit the east coast 
finn said he tells callers nostradamus never predicted a quake 
only a hailstorm and that the alleged prediction refers only to 
the new city not los angeles 
even if you believe in nostradamus the prediction is totally 
bogus finn said the prediction came out of that 1981 movie 
and they translated it very liberally that movie also predicted 
teddy kennedy would be elected president in 1984

arab underground leaders issued a warning from a mosque 
loudpeaker ordering gazans not to cooperate with the army they 
said the program was an attempt to abort the palestinian uprising 
also today israeli soldiers shot and wounded a palestinian 
after their jeep was stoned in the west bank village of ramin the 
army command said the unidentified youth was taken to tulkarem 
hospital where he was in serious condition israel radio reported 
a soldier was slightly injured in the incident 
in gaza city hundreds of people crowded into a school which has 
been converted into a makeshift registration center many said the 
army forced them to come 
at dawn this morning the troops entered peoples homes they 
knocked at the door and asked for ids and told us we had to change 
them said sheik khalo a moslem religious leader from gaza city 
one witness told an arab reporter that soldiers confiscated one 
portion of the israeliissued identity cards without which the 
card becomes invalid 
soldiers told residents of rimal a gaza city neighborhood of 
8000 people that was the first area targeted by the program to 
bring two color photographs fill out applications and pay 10 for 
new cards 
the orders affect palestinians between the age of 18 and 60 
israeli authorities say the new cards are being issued because 
many of the old ones are torn and worn 
palestinians say the measure is aimed at increasing military 
control over the arab population and breaking a tax boycott one of 
the chief tactics of the uprising military officials have said 
residents will have to pay back taxes before being issued new id 
cards 
arabs in the occupied lands must carry an identity card at all 
times and show the card at frequent security checks identity cards 
are vital for all transactions with the military government 
many arabs who showed up today were angry because there was only 
one official to process their applications 
it is ramadan a moslem holy month we are fasting said 
ahmed abu hassan 26 we are not animals to spend all day here 
waiting 
israeli troops set up several roadblocks near the registration 
center and patroled the area with jeeps 
a group of palestinian youths about 20 yards from the center set 
tires afire threw stones at passing cars and told adults not to 
renew their cards when army jeeps raced to the scene the youths 
ran off 
the refusal to change the id cards is the beginning of civil 
disobedience said one slogan painted on a gaza wall 
an 18yearold palestinian who identified himself only as 
mohammed said he would not change his card 
on the new ids they will write all the previous times i was in 
prison he said if its written on the id that i was in prison 
i will get special treatment every time i get stopped they will 
beat me 
in the west bank the army kept a curfew today on the dheisheh 
refugee camp where on monday troops opened fire to disperse 
stonethrowing youths 
israeli newspapers reported that a 34yearold father of seven 
who died at dheisheh was killed by a stray bullet while he was at 
his home up the hill from the protest the daily hadashot 
identified the victim as ibrahim hussein 
his death brought to 185 the number of arabs killed since the 
uprising began dec 8 two israelis also have been slain 
curfews were in place today in the village of irtas where 
troops wounded three palestinians during a protest monday and the 
balata and jabaliya refugee camps 
elsewhere in the occupied lands and arab east jerusalem a 
general strike called by underground leaders halted most commerce 
for a second day israeli radio reported however that thousands 
of palestinian from the occupied territories went to their jobs in 
israel 
the supreme court on monday stayed the deportation order of 
arabamerican activist mubarak awad until a hearing may 23 but 
rejected a defense motion for his release from jail after prime 
minister yitzhak shamir said awad could endanger israels security 
awad 44 was moved today to ramle prison from the jerusalem 
lockup where he had been held since thursday a police spokesman 
told the associated press 
the government has accused awad an advocate of civil 
disobedience against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip of inciting palestinians to violence it also says his 
tourist visa expired 
the defense argues that awad cannot be deported because he was 
born in jerusalem awad also is an american citizen and has a home 
in wapakoneta ohio

a high school health teacher who wanted 
to give his students a break from serious classwork showed his 
students a videotape detailing gruesome deaths and animal slaughter 
dale brown admits he realized that showing 45 minutes of faces 
of death to his secondperiod class monday was a mistake even 
so he showed the film to later classes because students talked him 
into it 
it was a bad choice said brown who is also an assistant 
football coach at huntington high school 
the 105minute videotape shows autopsies dismemberment 
physical cruelty human combustion and electrocution its package 
says video stores also bill the movie as offering the most 
bizarre grisly death experiences 
jeannie adkins the manager of a huntington video store said 
faces of death is probably one of the most popular things we 
have in here 
brown said he rented the video friday and planned to show it 
monday as a break from regular classwork students were not 
required to watch the film and were allowed to work on other 
subjects while the tape was playing 
still some of the 42 students who saw the video complained 
about it 
he probably shouldnt have shown it said student kelly 
chaffin who called the movie pretty disgusting pretty cruel 
chaffin said the movie showed people hammering on a monkeys 
head and eating its contents and showed the slaughter of sheep and 
cows brown turned off the movie just as a womans body was cut 
open she said 
her mother brenda chaffin said parents should have been 
notified beforehand 
melissa limle another student said she kept her back turned 
and worked on homework but the sound effects were even 
disgusting 
brown said some of his students suggested the movie but added 
that he did not view the videotape before showing it to his 
secondperiod class 
after the first showing he said he realized it had been a 
mistake he said he showed it to his third and fifthperiod 
classes later though because he allowed the students to talk me 
into it 
assistant principal myron bailes said he would have to see the 
video tape before determining whether it was unsuitable for high 
school students

postmaster general anthony frank said today 
that he hopes to restore full postal service by the end of summer 
our tentative goal is late summer frank said at a 
breakfast with reporters 
window hours at most post offices have been reduced by a 
halfday a week and sunday sorting operations and box collections 
were cut earlier this year following congressionally imposed 
budget reductions for the agency 
the service reductions save 9 million a month frank said and 
restoring them means that amount of money must be saved in some 
other way with improved efficiency and cutting other spending 
rate increases imposed on april 3 do not affect the service 
changes frank said the accounting system required by congress 
results in the increased income being counted as a reduction in the 
national debt not as extra money for the agency

ronald reagan is hesitant about bothering the 
people who work for him so much so that he once let smoke pour 
from the fireplace in his office rather than call for help donald 
regan says 
reagan did not want to make any demands on anyone the 
presidents former chief of staff says in for the record the 
newest collection of outofschool tales by a white house departee 
so the chief executive did nothing when a fire caused by a clogged 
chimney in his study in the west wing broke out 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
he stayed at his desk regan wrote reading his documents 
with smarting eyes until the guards asked if he wouldnt like to 
move to another room while they put out the fire and the place 
aired out he hadnt wanted to bother anybody 
in his book regan offers contradictory portrayals of reagan 
on one hand picturing the president as disengaged and indecisive a 
leader who laid down no rules and articulated no mission and 
on the other hand drawing him as involved and interested 
in contrast to his harsh depiction of first lady nancy reagan 
he describes reagan as judicious eager to hear both sides a 
formidable reader who carries thick folders of reading material 
under his arm when he leaves the office for the family quarters 
around 4 pm daily incapable of uttering an unkind word about 
others and in love with his job 
so regans reagan 
is aware of what he doesnt know he hesitates to ask 
questions or confess to a lack of knowledge in the presence of 
strangers regan wrote and thanks to the way his staff 
operated nearly everyone was a stranger to this shy president 
except the members of his innermost circle 
would apologize for asking a basic sometimes even a 
startling basic question about an arcane subject 
has a good working command of economics his grasp of basic 
economic theory as it had been taught in his time eureka college 
class of 32 was excellent and he had kept abreast of later 
theory regan wrote he had no trouble understanding the 
leading ideas of the day or in making reasonable judgments about 
the effects produced by policies based on keynesian theory of 
which he was deeply suspicious 
is a formidable reader and a talented conversationalist with 
a gift for listening and a man who at heart is an 
oldfashioned smalltown american who believes what he reads in 
the papers 
gets in trouble because of his capacity to remember and 
believe everything that is told to him if someone told him to 
use a wholly fictitious example that there had been 35987 hairs 
in stalins mustache this fact would go into the presidential 
memory bank possibly to emerge weeks or months later in the middle 
of a press conference regan wrote it never seemed to occur to 
him that anyone would give him incorrect information his mind was 
a trove of facts and anecdotes something like the morgue of one of 
his favorite magazines readers digest and it was impossible to 
guess when or why he might access any one of these millions of 
bytes of data 
loves the routine of his job wrote regan he regarded his 
daily schedule as being something like a shooting script in which 
characters came and went scenes were rehearsed and acted out and 
the plot was advanced one day at a time if he was scheduled to 
receive a visitor at 10 oclock he would finish whatever else he 
was doing at 958 clear off his desk clear his mind of whatever 
had gone before and prepare himself for the next scene 
perks up when women are present regan said everyone who 
travels with the president has come to believe that pan american 
world airways assigns its prettiest stewardesses to the plane 
carrying the white house press corps this happy circumstance did 
not escape the presidents notice he wrote when air force one 
landed the president always looked for the pan am stewardesses 
from the press plane and gave them a fatherly wave they waved back 
enthusiastically pretty young women in their uniforms smiling at 
the most famous man in the world it was a moment everyone looked 
forward to on presidential journeys 
displays no enthusiasm for an annual tradition accepting the 
national thanksgiving turkey the president always groaned when 
he saw this on his schedule and more than once suggested that the 
vice president stand in for him regan wrote oh no you 
dont i would reply youve got to have your picture taken with 
the turkey mr president its tradition

too late for him to make a comeback in the presidential race 
dukakis called on republican rival george bush to detail his 
knowledge of drug allegations against panamanian strongman manuel 
antonio noriega 
the massachusetts governors comments on monday came as aides to

became aware of the allegations against the panamanian strongman 
who was indicted on federal drug charges in february bush did not 
campaign monday and had no campaign appearances scheduled today 
in west virginia today bill harrington the secretary of 
states chief of staff said the weathers real good throughout

farmers have become isolated from the political process 
conagra and cargill cant supply the economic nutrition to 
this country that family farmers can he said referring to the 
giant food and grain conglomerates

running longer and running stronger because my mind is made up 
press on press on

todays contests do not offer an especially large share of 
democratic delegates 37 in west virginia and 25 in nebraska of 
the 2081 delegates needed to nominate dukakis has 15197 to 
jacksons 9331 according to the associated press count 
but two more victories would help cement dukakis grip on the 
nomination which aides have been saying he could clinch in the 
seasonclosing primaries june 7 in california and new jersey 
for jackson who won last weeks district of columbia primary 
but notched no primary victories in the six weeks prior to that a 
strong showing in either state would be a welcome respite 
even before todays contests were decided jackson was heading 
for the next battleground oregon which holds its primary a week 
from today with 45 democratic delegates at stake 
dukakis met monday with new jersey sen bill bradley and aides 
said the two talked about ussoviet relations bush has already 
made dukakis lack of foreign policy experience an issue 
bradley said he did not think dukakis was vulnerable on the 
issue experience is no substitute for ability and hes got real 
ability bradley said 
dukakis meanwhile zeroed in on a foreignpolicy matter that is 
becoming a sticky one for bush noriega and the reagan 
administrations dealings with him 
who was dealing with him and why dukakis said were we 
paying him and if so why i can tell you one thing if im the 
president we wont be doing business with drugrunning panamanian 
dictators

briggs had told bush in december 1985 about the allegations but 
briggs now posted to honduras told reporters he had not presented 
bush with evidence of a noriegadrug link 
bush spokesman peter teeley said monday that bush was aware of 
rumors of drug involvement by the noriega government prior to 
noriegas indictment teeley said the reports were unsubstantiated 
and panama was one of a number of countries about which there were 
such reports 
in other developments

receiving secret service protection effective wednesday

aloha airlines has decided to permanently remove 
from service three aging boeing 737 jetliners that were grounded 
after another aloha jet blew open on an interisland hop last month 
milton goto an aloha spokesman called the monday move a 
business decision designed to maintain public confidence and not a 
result of any problems 
in our opinion these aircraft are very airworthy goto said 
but because the investigation has focused on aircraft cycles age 
and possible structural problems associated with age we feel there 
is a cloud over these airplanes 
aloha grounded the planes april 29 a day after a flight 
attendant was killed and 61 passengers were injured when part of 
the passenger cabins roof tore off aloha flight 243 pilots were 
able to land the plane on the island of maui 
the jet carrying 89 passengers five crew members and an air 
traffic controller blew open at 24000 feet exposing passengers 
to open air 
an aircraft cycle refers to the number of times an airplane has 
taken off and landed 
federal investigators said the jet that blew open april 28 had 
about 89000 cycles goto said the three jets removed from service 
had about 50000 60000 and 85000 cycles respectively 
national transportation safety board investigators suspect 
structural failure brought on by age may have caused the front 20 
feet of the 19yearold planes passenger cabin to tear away 
the ntsb wont complete its investigation for months but we 
feel a responsibility to the public to maintain confidence goto 
said 
goto said aloha plans to lease planes to replace the three 
jetliners permanently removed from service 
goto said the three jets would remain grounded until aloha 
officials are sure they are airworthy then the airline will decide 
whether to sell or scrap them 
fortunately aloha is a very financially strong airline 
goto said

today he did not know what problems were holding up us senate 
ratification of the mediumrange missile treaty 
shevardnadze speaking to reporters after arriving in geneva for 
a meeting later this week with secretary of state george shultz 
indicated the soviet union had not made any new proposals to 
resolve the verification dispute which has arisen in the senate 
basically the verification problems regarding the inf treaty 
have been resolved i think he said in answer to a reporters 
question im not quite clear what the problems in the senate 
are we have not been told yet 
shevardnadze said the us side was asking certain questions 
certain points of clarification on the verification issue we 
answered those questions and we thought that there is no problem 
he said 
he said that on other questions not dealing with verification 
we have brought new ideas he said the ideas were in all 
areas but he did not elaborate 
president reagan and soviet communist party chief mikhail 
gorbachev signed an agreement dec 8 to eliminate the two sides

we shall determine the prospects of our work in the future

pope john paul ii in his first full day 
in south americas most impoverished country today criticized 
the abysmal differences between rich and poor countries and the 
profits made by banks on loans to third world nations 
several hundred thousand people gathered for a latemorning mass 
the pontiff celebrated in a dusty open field encircled by the 
snowcapped andean peaks near la pazs international airport 
13150 feet above sea level 
earlier the pope met with diplomats at the papal nuncios 
residence in the center of the city 
the abysmal differences between rich and poor countries are 
incompatible with divine designs of a just and equal sharing of the 
goods of creation john paul said 
he said the underdevelopment of the third world and 
particularly its foreign debts spawned social and political 
instability in many countries 
the imbalance between the amount of this debt and the capacity 
to pay it the difference between the sums loaned and the profits 
demanded by creditors is causing very grave damage to many poor 
countries he said 
thousands of people including peasants in indian dress and 
traditional bowler hats greeted the pontiff at the la paz airport 
after his arrival from uruguay on monday 
he appealed to them not to lose hope 
i will spend five days among you sharing your aspirations 
seeing firsthand this nation stricken by poverty and a lack of 
development and resources he said 
president victor paz estenssoro who welcomed the pope said in 
his speech that the visit would help bolster the flagging spirits 
of bolivians 
bolivia devastated by unemployment and crime is south 
americas poorest country its 42 billion foreign debt is about 
eight times its annual gross national product 
you come at a time when bolivia is suffering bitter tests that 
could weaken its spirit or perhaps sink it into a state of 
desperation the 80yearold president said 
on monday the pope addressed the countrys 39 bishops asking 
them to defend themselves against the proselytist activity of 
sects that in recent times are multiplying in bolivia 
these fundamentalist sects are sowing confusion among the 
people and unfortunately could very soon dilute the coherence and 
unity of the evangelical message john paul said 
during the meeting the 67yearold pontiff seemed to tire 
bishop julio terrazas head of the bolivian episcopal conference 
refrained from delivering his address to the pope because we see 
that the pope is tired 
he handed the pontiff a copy of his speech in which he says 
bolivia suffers from a situation of injustice that consumes 
thousands of brothers in degrading misery and inhumane 
unemployment 
john paul will visit seven bolivian cities ranging from the 
tinmining center of oruro devastated by mine closures to the 
lowland boom town of santa cruz a center of ranching agriculture 
and cocaine trafficking 
bolivias flourishing cocaine industry supplies an estimated 
onethird of the us and the eurpean market 
the popes south american tour his ninth began friday in 
uruguay and will take him to peru and paraguay where he will spend 
his 68th birthday before returning to rome on may 18 
the pontiff has made 37 pilgrimages abroad since he became head 
of the 800millionmember roman catholic church nearly a decade ago

in western suburbs following the fire at a switching station in

international airport because air traffic controllers at the 
federal aviation administrations control center in aurora had 
difficulty communicating with the ohare control tower faa

a defense attorney today asked jurors not to 
be bullied by public opinion when they consider the fate of a 
man accused of killing 16 people while a prosecutor said in his 
opening statement that he would demand the death penalty 
prosecutor john bynum summarized in a 15minute statement the 
crimes for which r gene simmons 47 of dover is on trial 
the retired air force master sergeant is accused of fatally 
shooting former coworker kathy c kendrick 24 and james d 
chaffin 33 during a dec 28 rampage in russellville officials 
said ms kendrick spurned simmons advances a year before her death 
and that chaffin was a chance victim 
if convicted of murder simmons could be sentenced to death or 
life in prison without parole in addition to two counts of murder 
he is charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of 
kidnapping 
trial is set july 18 for the deaths of simmons wife and 13 
other relatives who were shot or strangled during the christmas 
holidays before the shooting rampage their bodies were found on 
simmons property 47 miles east of ozark 
bynum said miss kendrick was shot four times in the head he 
also said a woman wounded by simmons was first shot in the head as 
she sat at a desk at a russellville business after she fell he 
said simmons went around the desk 
he stood over and he fired another shot into her chest near 
her heart the prosecutor said 
defense attorney robert e doc irwin during an 11minute 
statement asked jurors to consider variations in statements given 
by witnesses in describing the assailant 
the defense asks that you not be bullied by public opinion by 
what the press may say or by what the public may say irwin said 
police chief herb johnston of russellville the first witness 
explained the order of the shootings at four russellvile businesses 
and identified simmons as the man who handed him one of the 
22caliber revolvers the police say was used in the shootings 
the trial in the two deaths was moved here after the defense 
said pretrial publicity prevented selection of an impartial jury in 
pope county 
during the six hours it took to pick the jury monday simmons 
murmured to his attorneys and chatted with reporters covering the 
case asking for copies of their news stories security at the 
franklin county courthouse was tight with up to 10 officers inside 
the courtroom 
irwin objected after prospective juror jack morton of ozark told 
judge john patterson i know too much ive been working down 
around dover a little bit ive got my mind already made up 
as the judge ordered morton to stop talking irwin moved for 
rejection of the panel of prospective jurors and a mistrial 
patterson denied the motions saying no harm had been done 
the state struck seven jurors and the defense only one 
patterson excused nine others generally because they said they 
already believed simmons was guilty 
asked whether he could be impartial robert agee 48 of ozark 
replied as much as ive seen and heard it may be hard to do 
but ill do my best 
agee agreed with irwin that community sentiment was that the 
death penalty would be appropriate for simmons but promised to 
return a verdict of innocent if not convinced of the defendants 
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt 
i have to make unpopular decisions every day said agee 
general manager of the arkansas valley electric cooperative corp 
he was seated 
the slayings made nationwide news but the trial appeared to be 
having little effect on this northwest arkansas town of 3600 most 
of the spectators in the courtroom monday were reporters 
tracy clary 18 a senior at ozark high school said she was 
unaware of the trial until she heard classmates say their parents 
were among those summoned for possible jury duty 
people are taking it in stride miss clary said 
its a big topic in town she added people have strong 
opinions about the guy and what he did in russellville

an effort to save money by closing unneeded 
military bases is the stickiest wicket in the pentagon budget 
bill for the fiscal year starting oct 1 sen alan dixon dill 
said today 
senators discussed whether to give the defense department 
authority to close bases with many legislators loath to shut down 
facilities and lose jobs in their states 
dixon reflecting the political sensitivity of the issue said 
the plan was the stickiest wicket in this bill 
the bill includes a provision creating a sevenmember commission 
that would recommend by dec 31 which of the 3800 us military 
installations could be shut down 
the proposal is an attempt to circumvent congressional 
opposition to shutting bases the military has not closed any major 
bases since 1977 when congress erected a series of stiff rules 
pentagon officials say that between 2 billion and 5 billion a 
year could be saved if unneeded installations were closed 
dixon noting the proposed baseclosing commission doesnt 
include any legislators has suggested increasing the panel to 13 
the other six members would all be senate or house members 
including dixon 
the way this is written would given absolute power to the 
department of defense said dixon 
sen carl levin dmich said the publics in our communities 
rely on these baseswhen and if we close any bases it better not 
look political adding legislators is the best way to give this 
credibility he said 
between 1961 and 1977 the pentagon closed or reduced 3600 
installations saving an estimated 5 billion a year but because 
of the legal roadblocks erected by congress none have been closed 
since then 
the pentagon has even given up formally proposing base closures 
because of the strong capitol hill opposition 
last week in announcing the sevenmember commission defense 
secretary frank c carlucci noted that some have suggested that 
this may be an exercise in futility 
the proposal in the senate bill will be considered by the house 
as separate legislation 
as the senate began work on the bill monday the leaders of 
senate armed services committee warned that pentagon spending 
probably wont be increased for several years unless federal budget 
problems are solved 
the bill authorizes the pentagon to spend 2995 billion in 
fiscal 1989 about the same amount permitted in the current year 
the bill would provide the fourth consecutive year of little or 
no increase in pentagon spending after the large increases during 
reagans first term 
the bills spending total was part of the socalled budget 
summit last december between reagan and congressional leaders as 
part of the drive to reduce federal spending 
that is about 33 billion less than the pentagon thought it 
would have next year the reductions were ordered by carlucci who 
approved cuts in personnel and the entire retirement of some 
weapons including 16 aging navy frigates 
the bill that eventually passes the senate will be reconciled 
with the separate pentagon budget bill that the house will consider 
later this week the house spent two weeks voting on its measure 
and is scheduled to finally approve the bill on wednesday 
while both bills provide 2995 billion there are a number of 
major differences for example the house measure proposes 35 
billion for star wars compared with the 46 billion figure in the 
senate bill reagan sought 48 billion

death row inmate james edward smith 
wants his execution to proceed as planned wednesday morning but 
his mother wants the us supreme court to rule he isnt competent 
to select death over life

us supreme court on monday after the texas court of criminal 
appeals denied an execution stay said bob walt an assistant texas 
attorney general 
the state of texas planned to file a response with the high 
court today after which the justices would consider the case walt 
said 
smith today requested rhaeakunda dirt for his final meal a 
request texas department of corrections officials said would not be 
honored 
its not food its not sanitary prison spokesman david 
nunnelee said hell be offered something off the regular prison 
menu 
smith 37 was convicted in the 1983 robberyslaying of a 
houston insurance office manager mrs hamilton of indianapolis 
claims her son is mentally incompetent 
telephone messages left at the office and home of mrs 
hamiltons austin attorney ray donley were not returned monday 
evening mrs hamilton reached at her indianapolis home monday 
afternoon said she was unaware of the texas ruling and said she 
wasnt sure what legal strategy would be followed 
smith has no attorney and has resisted any attempts for legal 
help from capital punishment opponents 
mr smith doesnt want to be represented robert mcglassen 
of the capital punishment clinic at the university of texas law 
school said monday he hasnt asked for our help 
mcglassen said the execution should not be carried out because 
the us supreme court is considering a challenge to the texas 
death penalty statute 
since the high court agreed to hear the case of death row inmate 
donald gene franklin inmates routinely have won stays of 
execution a decision in the franklin case is expected soon 
convicted killer robert streetman who also asked to be put to 
death is the only inmate executed in texas so far this year 
the man has a right to make his own choice said bob walt 
an assistant attorney general if he wants to file an appeal im 
not going to deprive a man of his day in court 
smith a former tarot card dealer in new orleans who was working 
as a houston taxi driver was convicted for the 1983 shooting death 
of larry rohus 
testimony at his trial showed he was tackled by witnesses while 
fleeing the shooting scene and that a gun he was carrying was 
linked to the rohus slaying 
smith repeatedly has said he is innocent but says he does not 
want to spend the rest of his life withering away on death row 
he also has accused death penalty opponents of caring little for 
him personally while urging him to seek a stay to further their own 
philosophical goals 
if he receives lethal injection he will be the 28th prisoner 
executed in texas and the 99th nationally since the us supreme 
court in 1976 allowed capital punishment to resume

michel rocard a socialist known for his appeal to 
frances political center was chosen today by president francois 
mitterrand to succeed conservative jacques chirac as premier 
chirac defeated sunday when mitterrand swept to reelection to 
a new sevenyear term visited the presidential elysee palace to 
submit his resignation ending two years of an uneasy powersharing 
between a conservative premier and socialist president 
mitterrands chief of staff jeanlouis bianco made a terse 
announcement about 2 hours later saying only the 57yearold 
rocard would be the new premier and providing no details of who 
would serve in the cabinet 
the new premier will be expected to invite nonsocialists into 
the cabinet to demonstrate an appeal beyond the partys boundaries 
because chirac still has support of the centerright majority 
coalition in the national assembly the constitution did not 
require him to step down and the president could not dismiss him 
but there was never any doubt chirac would quit following his 
defeat at the polls mitterrand won reelection with 54 percent of 
the vote to chiracs 46 percent 
rocard always has been rated among the most popular politicians 
in public opinion polls he is known for stating his opinions 
whether or not they coincided with his partys 
rocard resigned as agriculture minister in the socialist 
government of premier laurent fabius in 1985 saying he could not 
support a change to a new system of electing the national assembly 
that distributed seats among parties based on their proportion of 
the vote 
the socialists control just 211 seats in the 577member national 
assembly so the new premier will need to form either a firm 
coalition with centrist forces or make temporary alliances on 
particular issues 
mitterrand also could dissolve the body and call new elections 
but he has said he would do so only if his first government loses a 
vote of confidence 
the centerright union for french democracy which teamed up 
with chiracs neogaullist rally for the republic in the government 
for the past two years said in a statement that it would not 
automatically vote to censure the new government it said it would 
judge the new premiers proposals on their individual merits 
the extremeright national front said its leader jeanmarie le 
pen has become at this hour the de facto leader of the national 
and popular opposition to organize the france of french people 
against socialism 
le pen drew a surprising 144 percent of the vote in the first 
round of the presidential election on april 24 when chirac won 
just 199 percent and mitterrand received 341 percent

four of wall streets biggest firms said today 
they had indefinitely suspended a highly profitable computerized 
method of trading stocks because of widespread criticism that it is 
causing volatility and destroying investor confidence 
the announcements by salomon brothers inc morgan stanley amp 
co painewebber inc and bear stearns amp co came amid an uproar 
about socalled indexarbitrage program trading and a protracted 
slump in the stock market since the october crash nearly seven 
months ago 
the firms actions came a week after the new york stock exchange 
intensified postcrash limits on program trading blamed for 
causing enormous swings in stock prices for reasons unrelated to 
underlying values 
salomon and morgan are among the most significant users of the 
technique which uses highvolume computers to sell stocks in new 
york and buy equivalent stockindex futures in chicago or vice 
versa to profit from fleeting price disparities 
bear stearns and painewebber is considered a smaller user of 
program trading 
salomon morgan and painewebber said they were suspending the 
technique as of today for their own accounts although they would 
continue to do it for customers if requested 
bear stearns said it had suspended the technique for its own 
account as well as customer accounts as of last thursday but 
didnt publicize it until the other firms made announcements today 
i think its certainly a move in the right direction said 
jack barbanel head of commodities and financial futures at the new 
york brokerage gruntal amp co its meaningul because at least 
theres beginning to be an acknowledgment to the public perception 
that program trading causes turbulence 
large numbers of investors have complained to the nyse and their 
brokers that program trading has compelled them to get out of 
stocks because they believe it has made the market more like a 
gambling casino brokers also are growing resentful of the 
relatively small number of program traders 
moreover there is a belief in the securities industry that 
lawmakers will take severe legislative action aimed at restoring 
investor confidence unless brokerage firms can find ways to reform 
themselves 
we have decided to suspend any noncustomerrelated index 
arbitrage activity with the goal of furthering the serious analysis 
of the role of index arbitrage in market volatility 
painewebbers chairman and chief executive donald b marron said 
in a statement 
it is our hope that all interest regulators and market 
participants work together in an objective manner to find an 
intelligent and mutually acceptable solution to this issue 
john gutfreund chairman and chief executive of salomon said in 
a statement that his firm will abstain from all domestic stock 
index propriatary arbitrage for the present time 
it is necessary for all to work toward the goal of restoring 
confidence in and guaranteeing the vibrancy of the marketplace 
he said 
morgan said in a statement that the efforts of our industry 
the exchanges the regulators and congress should be directed 
towards expanding liquidity reducing volatility and restoring 
public confidence in the equity markets 
we have no present intention of starting again that doesnt 
mean we wont do it again alan c greenberg bear stearns 
chairman and chief executive said in an answer to a telephone 
query the profit is greatly overstated if everybody thinks its 
so important to stop well give in to it

senate action on the ussoviet mediumrange 
missile treaty has been put on the back burner until there is a 
resolution of complaints of alleged kremlin backsliding on 
inspection provisions senate majority leader robert c byrd said 
today 
the white house said it supported the delay 
it could be resolved in a matter of hours in a matter of 
days or it might never be resolved byrd a west virginia 
democrat told reporters 
the dispute could be settled quickly but probably only if 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze offers concessions when 
he meets with secretary of state george p shultz later this week 
the soviets can resolve this fast said byrd the thing 
that can expedite this is for the administration and the soviets to 
sit down and close these loopholes 
we dont want to give the soviets loopholes to cheat he 
said this obviously needs fixing and the time to fix it is 
before the senate takes up the treaty 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the administration backs the delay in the senate debate 
we feel this is a prudent and reasonable course of action 
he said there is unanimity between the administration and the 
bipartisan senate leadership that these problems should be 
satisfactorily and promptly resolved prior to ratification 
the administration has made clear to the soviets the need for 
an expeditious solution he said 
assistant senate republican leader alan simpson of wyoming and 
sen richard lugar rind emerging from a morning meeting with 
president reagan said he was confident the problems can be 
surmounted 
we have much to do in the senate we have the three or four 
issues to resolve were ready to do that simpson told reporters 
outside the white house were all very interested in what will 
take place with secretary shultz and foreign minister shevardnadze 
i think that they will do their usual good job of splicing things 
back together again 
we just hope that there are only misunderstandings on 
verification and that after the shultzshevardnadze talks itll be 
clear that the inf treaty has some onsite provisions there that 
are mutually agreed to lugar said 
i dont think the president is pushing anybody he wants 
clarification of what we all meant lugar said 
shevardnadze arriving in geneva for the talks said that 
basically the verification problems have been resolved i 
think im not quite clear what the problems in the senate are 
we have not been told yet 
the foreign minister said the united states was asking certain 
questions certain points of clarification on the verification 
issue we answered those questions and we thought that there is 
no problem he said 
a pall is certain to be cast over the planned moscow summit 
meeting between reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev if 
the treaty dispute is not resolved by the time reagan arrives in 
the soviet capital on may 29 
reagan had wanted to take a ratified treaty to moscow for a 
signing ceremony but the delay may make that impossible even if 
the dispute itself is resolved by then 
byrd announced monday that he was indefinitely postponing senate 
debate on ratification of the intermediaterange nuclear forces or 
inf treaty debate had tentatively been set to begin wednesday 
after conferring with other senators and white house officials 
byrd said a serious dispute over verification issues had arisen and 
added 
this treaty will not be brought up until these problems are 
resolved it is obvious that not only have the problems that had 
previously surfaced not been resolved but that new problems have 
arisen he said 
i think it behooves the soviets to come forward with solutions 
and permit the senate to open the debate with our eyes open byrd 
said we dont want to walk off a cliff 
byrd said he will not reschedule debate until assured by the 
senate intelligence armed services and foreign relations 
committees that satisfactory onsite inspection procedures have 
been agreed to by the soviets in writing and that other problems 
also have been resolved 
byrd acted after a meeting between senators and white house 
chief of staff howard h baker and national security adviser colin 
powell 
leaving the meeting powell expressed approval of the decision 
saying not a bad course of action 
the pact the product of difficult negotiations dating to the 
beginning of the reagan administration in 1981 was signed amid 
widespread celebration at last decembers reagangorbachev summit 
meeting here 
it requires the elimination of all groundlaunched missiles with 
a range of from 300 to 3400 miles 
sen david boren dokla the intelligence committee chairman 
and sen william cohen rmaine the vice chairman said they were 
surprised at the timing and nature of the soviet action 
they said there are about 10 outstanding and unresolved 
verification issues boren said the soviets are apparently adamant 
beyond their usual bargaining stance 
to have the soviets reneging is very alarming to me 
boren said there is some real perverseness here 
he said soviet officials have turned us down flatly on some 
verification issues previously thought to have been settled while 
adopting a position of deliberate ambiguity on others 
cohen speculated that the soviets are attempting to use leverage 
in the days before the moscow summit to get what they couldnt 
get at the bargaining table 
this will either be resolved quickly or it wont be resolved 
at all cohen said 
the verification dispute centers mostly on access of us 
monitors to soviet missile plants and sites 
the soviets are trying to restrict inspection of missile 
containers to those large enough to carry an entire rocket the 
united states wants the right to examine smaller containers that 
could carry a missile stage 
secondly a us official said the soviets are trying to place 
off limits parts of areas designated for inspection 
the state department last month asked the soviets for an 
explanation 
ambassador yuri v dubinin delivered moscows reply to the 
department sunday night state department officials then briefed 
the intelligence committee on monday 
we dont consider the soviet response to our questions fully 
satisfactory said a us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity theres more work to be done

ronald reagan always a soft touch for a 
personal anecdote was convinced of the need to radically overhaul 
the nations tax law when told that his secretary paid more in 
taxes than 60 of the largest us corporations donald regan writes 
in his new book 
the presidents former treasury secretary and exchief of staff 
takes much of the credit for passage of the 1986 tax reform act 
considered the major domestic achievement of reagans second term 
in for the record which went on sale monday regan writes 
that the idea of simplifying the tax code by closing loopholes and 
lowering tax rates was moribund when he took the cause to reagan at 
a white house meeting in late 1983 
president reagan liked to start every meeting off with a story 
or a joke so as a way of introducing the subject i asked him a 
question about his old employer general electric regan said 
what does general electric have in common with boeing general 
dynamics and 57 other big corporations 
reagan remembering fondly his days as a goodwill ambassador for 
ge smiled and leaned forward for the punchline only to be told 
what these outfits have in common is that not one of them pays a 
penny in taxes to the united states government your secretary 
paid more in federal taxes last year than all of those giant 
companies put together 
regan describes the president as shocked and flushed with anger 
by this news saying he didnt realize things had gotten that far 
out of line 
while capturing the presidents attention on this occasion 
regan says he often failed in getting reagan to focus on critical 
economic issues especially during the first term when regan served 
as treasury secretary 
he describes an administration torn apart by internal squabbles 
over huge budget deficits while the president remained remote and 
detached 
as treasury secretary regan said he was flying by the seat of 
my pants 
the president never told me what he believed or what he wanted 
to accomplish in the field of economics i had to figure these 
things out like any other american by studying his speeches and 
reading the newspapers regan says 
he said that during four years as treasury secretary he never 
met alone with reagan to discuss the presidents economic 
philosophy and the orders he received from aides such as edwin 
meese iii seldom quoted the president or referred to his thoughts 
i found this disembodied relationship bizarre regan said 
for a while i struggled against a certain anxiety that this 
method of running the worlds greatest economy might wreck the new 
presidency 
while crediting reagan with creating an atmosphere of 
confidence that helped in the recovery from the 198182 
recession regan said the president himself had very little to do 
with the invention and the implementation of the policies that 
came to be called reaganomics 
regan mentions frequent battles during the first term with 
former budget director david stockman former white house chief of 
staff james a baker iii bakers assistant richard darman as 
well as presidential economists murray weidenbaum and martin 
feldstein 
the others favored tax increases to lower the budget deficits 
while regan remained adamantly opposed threatening to resign on 
one occasion if the president accepted their recommendation 
stockman and regan often clashed over stockmans belief that the 
president would have to accept tax increases or run the risk that 
the federal deficit would balloon out of control 
stockman in his own tellall book published in 1986 said regan 
had given the president unlimited bad advice for years and years 
by essentially echoing and telling the president what he wants to 
hear 
former federal reserve chairman paul volcker was criticized by 
regan for unsettling financial markets and prolonging the recession 
by his traits of delphic mysteriousness and a bureaucratic 
fascination with tinkering 
in contrast to the harsh depiction of nancy reagan in the rest 
of the book for her use of astrology and her behindthethrone 
power regan says the first came to his aid in 1982 at a time when 
he had been shunted aside in the economic decisionmaking process 
by stockman and others 
mrs reagan called him to find out how he had answered a letter 
from her stepbrother dr richard davis concerning the health of 
the savings and loan industry the discussion then moved to regans 
general views on the economy 
regan quotes mrs reagan as saying defense secretary caspar w 
weinberger was greedy for funds for the military and had no idea he 
was hurting the economy 
mrs reagan said she felt the president needed to hear regans 
views 
ill have mike deaver put you on the schedule to see him 
she is quoted as saying

concern over rising inflation and footdragging 
among bureaucrats could scuttle chinas ambitious reform program 
and trigger a return to sovietstyle central planning a leading 
economist warned tuesday 
li yining dean of beijing universitys economic management 
department said the main threat to chinas economic development is 
not its 11percent annual inflation rate but the possibility that 
officials will halt reforms to control the price rises 
li who spent six years in labor reform camps during the 1960s 
and 1970s because he questioned central planning said chinas 
prosperity depends on letting the market determine prices and 
making independent entrepreneurs and family farmers the backbone of 
the economy 
the danger is that the need to stabilize the economic 
situation will be used to bring back the traditional system he 
told a foreign correspondents club of beijing news conference 
china shouldnt be afraid of small price rises he said 
chinas backward economy has grown rapidly in the past decade 
due to marketstyle economic reforms introduced by senior leader 
deng xiaoping as the government has gradually lifted its 
decadeold central controls however prices have soared 
generating widespread public discontent 
the government said retail prices rose an average of 11 percent 
in the first quarter of 1988 compared with 73 percent for all of 
1987 and 6 percent in 1986 
the jump has been even higher in large cities where price 
increases have soared as high as 19 percent prices of nonstaple 
foods have risen 30 percent in some places over the past year 
li said he agreed with premier li pengs statement that 
increasing supply of highdemand goods is the best solution he 
said he supported the governments recent decision to lift price 
controls on more items including pork chinas staple meat and to 
give urban consumers direct subsidies to compensate for price rises 
but he said price reform should be carried out gradually over a 
six to 10year period immediate decontrol of all prices would 
fuel inflation and lead to a run on bank deposits as price rises 
outstripped bank interest rates he said 
the second threat to reform li said is resistance among local 
officials and enterprises who only know the old ways and find it 
hard to change 
he said the government needs to improve its propaganda work 
we must tell ordinary people that in the past they had stable 
prices under conditions of poverty 
socialism must be based on a commodity economy li said one in 
which the market determines prices and allocation of materials and 
labor 
as long as the economy prospers and living standards are 
raised our purpose is fulfilled he added people will see 
that socialism is not connected with poverty but wealth 
asked about the need for democratic reforms to accompany 
economic change li said socialist democracy cant develop 
overnight as long as we are moving in the right direction it is 
fine

a man who was sentenced to death 14 years 
ago for the murders of a south georgia family was given six life 
sentences at his retrial today after a judge ruled jurors were 
hopelessly deadlocked over the death penalty 
the dekalb county superior court jury had deliberated into a 
seventh day without reaching a unanimous verdict in the sentencing 
phase of wayne carl colemans retrial 
judge hugh lawson declared the jury deadlocked at 1020 am 
today and sentenced coleman to six consecutive life terms in 
prison life is the automatic sentence when a jury fails to agree 
on the death penalty 
silas moore spokesman for the state board of pardons and 
paroles said coleman is immediately eligible for parole 
consideration and that the board probably will consider the case 
next month if parole is denied he said the board can wait up to 
eight years before hearing the case again 
moore said the case is covered by a 1964 law requiring parole 
consideration after an inmate has served no more than seven years 
of a life sentence coleman has been in jail since 1973 
defense attorney tom west said he doubted he would appeal either 
the sentence or the verdict we feel that its a vindication of 
the right to a fair trial waynes had a fair trial for the first 
time 
we can only assume that if wayne had had a fair trial 15 years 
ago he would have gotten a life sentence he said 
eleven members of the alday family and seminole county sheriff 
jerry godby who originally investigated the murders were present 
when the sentence was announced the family members broke into 
tears 
weve done our part well just have to live with their 
decision said patricia alday miller the oldest daughter of 
victim ned alday 
she said the family which has watched the trial since testimony 
began in april would immediately head home to donalsonville 
lawson told the jury the court understands that you would 
have preferred to reach a unanimous verdict but you should not 
feel bad that you have not 
coleman was one of three men sentenced to death in 1974 for the 
may 14 1973 slayings of ned alday his brother aubrey neds sons 
jerry jimmy and chester and jerrys wife mary 
the men were shot to death in jerry aldays mobile home near 
donalsonville and mary alday was killed in a nearby field after 
she was repeatedly raped 
the convictions of coleman carl isaacs and george elder dungee 
were thrown out in 1985 by a federal appeals court that cited 
pretrial publicity 
isaacs was convicted a second time in january and again 
condemned to die dungee is to be retried later in columbus 
the dekalb county jury which found coleman guilty of six counts 
of murder on may 2 had been deliberating his sentence since last 
wednesday 
the jury resumed deliberations today after a brief interruption 
while the judge interviewed jurors who heard a remark about coleman 
while eating breakfast at a restaurant 
court officials said a customer told one juror hes guilty 
and the juror repeated the remark lawson told the jurors the 
comment was improper and should have no effect on their 
impartiality 
during the lengthy sentencing deliberations lawson refused 
repeated motions by colemans attorneys to declare the jury 
deadlocked 
patsy morris case monitor for the american civil liberties 
unions capital litigation project said the length of the 
deliberations was unusual possibly unprecedented in the 
sentencing phase of a trial in georgia 
the longest i can recollect in 10 years of handling cases like 
this is about 15 hours over a threeday period she said 
relatives of the six alday victims spoke to reporters monday for 
the first time since the retrials began 
its been awful hard weve been waiting for 15 years to see 
justice said ernestine alday widow of ned alday and mother of 
jimmy jerry and chester alday 
she said faith in god has sustained the family hes going to 
be the judge

us administration to work for the hostages release was the only 
way that they would ever gain freedom that their cause must be 
kept in the public eye that by keeping the issue alive we are 
keeping the hostages alive

a nasa engineer said tuesday that a recent 
test firing of a fullsize booster rocket was the best so far in 
qualifying the redesigned rockets for the first postchallenger 
space shuttle flight 
royce mitchell project manager of the booster program at the 
marshall space flight center in huntsville ala said the april 20 
test showed nothing that would stand in the way of the flight 
scheduled for august 
the rockets must pass two more fullduration firings one in 
june and one in july before they receive final certification the 
boosters built by morton thiokol inc are tested at that

pregnant your senior year you cannot go to graduation

oregons traditional unkindness to 
frontrunners could give michael dukakis pause and jesse jackson 
encouragement as they head west for the next primary on the long 
campaign trail 
both democrats will be campaigning in oregon this week seeking 
a share of the 45 national convention delegates at stake next 
tuesday and also hoping to gain momentum for the primary seasons 
big finale in neighboring california 
vice president george bush also will be in the state this 
weekend even though he has sewn up the republican nomination 
there are 32 gop delegates at stake in oregon 
a statewide poll in midapril showed massachusetts gov dukakis 
the national frontrunner as the favorite among oregon democrats 
he had support from 48 percent compared to 28 percent for jackson 
but portland pollster tim hibbitts has said that even if jackson 
receives only 25 percent to 30 percent of the vote in the primary 
it would be a good showing for a black candidate in a state thats 
less than 2 percent black 
if history is any guide oregon shouldnt be taken for granted 
by anyone 
a number of candidates have had the wheels taken off their 
bandwagon when they got to oregon said state sen grattan 
kerans a eugene democrat whos a consultant for the dukakis 
campaign 
oregon voters in the 1984 democratic primary handed a lopsided 
victory to gary hart even though walter mondale was the established 
frontrunner nationally hart went on to win in california though 
mondale eventually won the democratic nomination 
indeed oregon democrats in four of the past nine presidential 
primaries have given victories to presidential candidates who 
failed to win their partys nomination 
oregon has been described as a maverick state and thats 
probably true kerans said you have people who are removed 
geographically from political power centers and they look at 
things from their own perspective 
jackson beginning a threeday oregon swing on tuesday is the 
first presidential candidate to visit the state this year but 
dukakis is planning stops on thursday and possibly saturday 
the jackson camp in particular views oregons primary as 
important because it directly precedes the june 7 california 
primary a good showing by jackson in a heavily white western 
state would show that he has broad appeal and would give him a big 
boost right before california a campaign aide said 
if the people in california see jesse do well in oregon we 
hope they will take their cue from that said john norris a 
national field coordinator for jackson were spending a lot of 
time here to send a message to the other western states 
during their visits to oregon jackson and dukakis plan to spend 
much of their time in the portland area jackson also has events in 
redmond the willamette valley and southern oregon 
in addition to portland appearances thursday dukakis plans to 
travel to medford and tentatively plans to take part in events in 
eugene and washington county oregons suburban hightech center 
on saturday 
bush is to campaign in portland on friday and in washington 
county and medford on saturday

the state board of pardons and paroles is 
reviewing the case of wayne williams convicted of two murders in a 
series of killings of young black people in preparation for his 
first parole hearing 
board spokesman silas moore said the fivemember board received 
the file this week and would announce its decision in early june 
williams 29 was convicted feb 27 1982 of murdering two of 
29 young blacks who were killed in atlanta from 1979 to 1981 he 
was sentenced to life in prison police later blamed him for an 
additional 22 slayings although he was not charged in them 
under georgia law all inmates serving life sentences must be 
considered for parole after seven years in prison it is unlikely 
williams will be released said parole board member michael wing 
with any multiple murder case it would be almost 
inconceivable that they would be paroled after the sevenyear 
mark he said in most instances that would put serious 
consideration for parole a long way off in the future 
lynn whatley of atlanta one of williams attorneys said 
williams hope for freedom is based on a successful appeal of his 
convictions not parole the appeal is pending in butts county 
where williams is an inmate at the georgia diagnostic and 
classification center

a jury today acquitted reputed mob boss 
nicodemo little nicky scarfo and eight associates on all 
charges in the 1984 slaying of gang rival salvatore testa 
scarfo raised his right hand in a near salute and grinned at the 
jury as it returned the verdicts spectators in the packed 
courtroom cheered and shouted 
scarfo 59 and the other eight defendants were being tried for 
the sept 14 1984 murder of testa his body with two bullets in 
the head was found trussed and wrapped in a blanket in southern 
new jersey woods 
scarfo faces charges in two other murders he was convicted last 
year of conspiring with a former city councilman to extort 1 
million from a waterfront developer he is serving 14 years in 
prison on that conviction 
when forewoman ollie minze said not guilty to the charge 
of conspiracy involving defendant joseph grande the courtroom 
erupted with a roar and some cheered common pleas judge albert 
sabo warned that if the outburst continued he would clear the 
courtroom 
the crowd quieted after scarfos lawyer robert simone 
cautioned its not over yet and ms minze resumed reading the 
verdict 
on all counts firstdegree murder conspiracy and possession 
of an instrument of a crime she said not guilty 
assistant district attorney barbara christie who had prosecuted 
the twomonth trial asked that the jury be polled as the name of 
each defendant was called and on each count jurors affirmed the 
verdicts 
when that was completed the defendants stood and embraced their 
lawyers and waved happily to their families and the jury as the 
eight women and four men who considered their fate left the 
courtroom 
i love the american judicial system scarfos son nicodemo 
jr told a reporter outside the courtroom the younger scarfo had 
been in the secondfloor city hall courtroom since the trial began 
in march 
police allege that the elder scarfo ran the 
philadelphiasouthern new jersey mafia family from his home in 
atlantic city nj before his arrest in the unrelated extortion 
case in 1986 
besides scarfo the defendants were his nephew philip leonetti 
of margate nj identified during the trial as the mobs 
underboss salvatore merlino of ventnor nj and philadelphians 
salvatore wayne grande joseph pungitore francis iannarella 
salvatore scafidi joseph grande and charles iannece 
the jury got the case monday after arguments from simone who 
attacked two former gangsters who were key prosecution witnesses 
and from ms christie who conceded that the informants nicholas 
nicky crow caramandi and thomas delgiorno were despicable and 
talked only after they were marked for death 
outside the courtroom today simone said it was the second trial 
in a row in which the defense beat prosecutors who used caramandi 
and delgiorno the two also also were the star prosecution 
witnesses when scarfo and four associates were acquitted in 
december of 20 federal drug charges 
this is the second time that a jury didnt listen to the lies 
of caramandi and delgiorno simone said it is a signal to the 
whole country that you just dont persecute people because of their 
alleged associations and activities if they come at us again we 
will hit them even harder 
ms christie left the courtroom after the verdict avoiding 
reporters 
the informants testified that scarfo gave the order to kill 
testa because testa was threatening scarfos control of the mob and 
because testa broke his engagement to the daughter of one of 
scarfos top lieutenants 
caramandi and delgiorno testified testa was murdered in a closed 
south philadelphia candy store caramandi said testa was lured by 
his best friend pungitore to the store where salvatore grande 
pumped two bullets into testas head the two witnesses said 
testas body was transported in a van to new jersey where it was 
dumped along a road

democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis battled 
jesse jackson in west virginia and nebraska on tuesday in 
lowintensity primary skirmishes along the way to a final showdown 
next month in california 
dukakis was heavily favored to capture both contests and a 
majority of the 62 delegates at stake thus reinforcing the 
impression that he is the democratic nominee in all but name 
neither primary generated much excitement in part because there 
seemed little suspense about the outcome but also because hotly 
contested statewide races overshadowed the presidential contest 
vice president george bush was the republican winner in advance 
on primary ballots in both states as usual the vice president 
who has clinched the gop nomination and has no active opposition in 
the remaining primary states looked forward to receiving the 
endorsement of president reagan on wednesday 
dukakis in contrast was several hundred delegates ahead of 
jackson but several hundred shy of the total needed to claim the 
democratic nomination aides expressed confidence he would command 
a nominating majority by the time the primary season ends on june 7 
with elections in california new jersey and two other states and 
dukakis has begun campaigning with one eye on jackson and the other 
on the fall campaign against bush 
the massachusetts governor had 1522 delegates to 935 for 
jackson it takes 2081 to claim the nomination 
the weeks democratic primaries offered a breather in the 
schedule after a rapidfire series of industrial state contests 
ending last week in indiana and ohio and pointing the way toward 
contests in oregon next week and california in early june 
neither democratic contender spent much time or devoted much 
advertising money to nebraska and west virginia and their 
campaigns were overshadowed by fierce gubernatorial and senatorial 
primaries 
in west virginia incumbent republican gov arch moore faced a 
stiff primary challenge from john raese while democrats picked an 
opponent to run against the survivor 
nebraska republicans chose between appointed sen david karnes 
and rep hal daub for the senate nomination former gov robert 
kerrey sought the democratic nomination to oppose the winner 
neither dukakis nor jackson seemed to mind that the presidential 
race was at a pause the massachusetts governor the nomination 
seemingly within his grasp took a weekend off for the first time 
in months 
jackson devoted part of his week to campaigning in california 
where he plans a costly and intensive effort to slow dukakis drive 
toward the nomination 
over the last six weeks dukakis has put together an impressive 
series of primary vitories in connecticut wisconsin new york 
pennsylvania ohio and indiana forcing all his rivals but one from 
the race and leaving jackson far behind in the hunt for delegates 
at the same time party leaders have begun to swing behind 
dukakis and treat him as the nomineeinwaiting but also hope to 
avoid antagonizing jackson and the millions of black voters who 
sustained his candidacy

a federal investigation concluded today that 
the crews failure to follow a required preflight check list caused 
the crash last august of a northwest airlines jet during takeoff at 
detroit 
a total of 156 people were killed in the crash the nations 
second worst commercial aviation accident 
the national transportation safety board said that the crew of 
northwest flight 255 did not properly set the mcdonnell douglas 
md80s flaps and slats to give the plane adequate lift for 
takeoff the devices were not set because the crew did not follow 
required checklist procedures as the plane prepared for takeoff 
the board said 
the finding immediately was criticized by the air line pilots 
association which promised to conduct further investigations into 
the aug 16 l987 accident 
they ntsb investigators fell short steven kramer a union 
member and northwest pilot who took part in the investigation told 
reporters after the ntsbs official probable cause was approved 
kramer was one of the unions representatives in the investigation 
the pilots group has maintained that it is possible a mechanical 
problem could have caused the flaps and slats to be in improper 
positions 
the safety board also cited as a contributing factor to the 
accident the failure of an alarm system to warn the crew that the 
plane was not configured properly for takeoff 
investigators have said that the alarm did not sound because it 
was not receiving electrical power but the board concluded the 
reason for the absence of electrical power could not be 
determined 
earlier in the day ntsb investigators had told the board that 
they had discovered a small amount of tarnish on the circuit 
breaker but not enough to interfere with the flow of electricity 
they also had no evidence of a voltage surge that might have popped 
the breaker or any conclusive evidence that it might have been 
intentionally pulled by either the flight crew or maintenance 
workers 
one investigator william laynor said the evidence we felt 
was overwhelming that the aircraft did indeed attempt to take 
off with the flaps retracted 
the boards hearing began with a dramatic computerized graphic 
simulation of the aug 16 crash 
the simulation in the form of a 16minute videotape traces the 
planes taxiing as it prepared to leave the airport the exchanges 
between the pilot and airport tower could be heard conversation 
inside the cockpit was graphically superimposed on the television 
screen 
the simulation showed that almost immediately after the 
mcdonnell douglas md80 lifted off from the runway it began to have 
problems dipping first to the left then the right then left and 
right again while at the same time veering away from the runway 
in a sequence that took only seconds the plane finally dipped 
sharply to the left and almost rolled over hitting a light post 
and than part of a building before crashing onto a highway 
ive got a crash on the airport airports closed a 
controller could be heard saying 
the pilot of flight 255 was capt john r maus 57 of las 
vegas the copilot was david j dodds 35 of galena ill 
since the crash pilot groups the airline and the planes 
manufacturer have offered sharply different versions of what they 
believe went wrong 
but the central issues of the accident have been known for 
months 
examination of the data recorder showed that the planes wing 
flaps were fully retracted when they should have been extended 11 
degrees the slats in the front part of the wing also were 
retracted 
such a configuration of the wings control surfaces sharply 
inhibited the twinengine jets ability to gain lift the plane 
rose no more than 50 feet off the ground 
mcdonnell douglas argued that the pilot and copilot were to 
blame because of a casual attitude during a preflight checklist 
and their alleged failure to set the flaps properly the 
manufacturer also accused the crew of pulling a circuit breaker to 
the alarm system so that it would not go off no specific evidence 
supporting that allegation has been produced 
northwest blamed the failure of the flap warning system and 
maintained there was evidence that the breaker had been 
tarnished so as not to give an alarm mcdonnell douglas 
acknowledges that some tarnish was found on the breaker but 
contends that did not keep it from sounding 
the pilots union to which both of the pilots belonged pointed 
to previous problems with the flap mechanism on the plane 
in any case the pilots union rejected suggestions that the 
warning system was disabled by the flight crew and suggested as 
did northwest airlines that a flaw in the circuit breaker 
prevented the alarm from sounding 
the crash was the second worst commercial aviation accident in 
us history ranking behind only the may 1979 crash of an american 
airlines jet in chicago that killed 275

dukakis spent scant time campaigning in either state devoting 
less than 24 hours combined to west virginia and nebraska aides 
said his campaign spent less than 50000 on television advertising 
in the two states 
the massachusetts governor took shots at bush over the issue of 
panamanian leader manuel noriega under indictment in the united 
states for drug activities and collected a stream of endorsements 
from democratic party leaders 
he won the support of seven governors during the week as he 
pushed his delegate advantage over jackson to nearly 600 
but dukakis also spent considerable time dealing with his 
states looming budget crunch a test of his campaign claim that 
he is a forceful leader who is not afraid to make tough decisions 
jackson spent parts of two days in west virginia and parts of 
three in nebraska but his advisers conceded they had little hope 
of derailing dukakis in either state 
instead jackson spent part of the past week in california his 
last plausible chance to slow dukakis and directed less fire 
toward his demnocratic rival and more toward bush 
when the vice president referred to jackson as a hustler from 
chicago a phrase that his aides said was meant to praise 
jackson for working hard jackson shot back that bush had 
started to panic 
vice president bush has begun to call me names he said 
hes trapped in an unholy triangle between the ayatollah noriega 
and meese he said referring to iranian leader ayatollah 
khomeini and the irancontra affair questions about noriegas drug 
activities and the legal difficulties surrounding attorney general 
edwin meese iii 
increasingly jackson portrayed himself as an insurgent 
candidate running against the combined forces of dukakis 
democratic leaders and the pundits 
he appealed to party officials who will attend the democratic 
national convention as delegates to wait until the primary campaign 
ends before swinging behind a candidate 
at one point he suggested his supporters might or might not work 
hard for the democratic ticket this fall depending on how he was 
treated but he later backed off saying we need not speak in 
terms of a fight 
bush spent little time campaigning in nebraska or west virginia 
alothough he toured several western states in a week in which he 
often seemed to be on the defensive 
his comment about jackson aside bush awoke one morning to 
discover two senior aides being quoted in a newsoaper story as 
calling meese a political liability 
i must say i am troubled by some of the allegations against 
the attorney general bush told reporters although he said he 
hadnt authorized either of his aides to speak out 
asked if he viewed meese as an albatross on his campaign bush 
replied an albatross i dont think so 
bush who headed a drug interdiction task force earlier in the 
reagan administration also was confronted with fresh questions 
about when he learned of noriegas alleged drug activities 
the vice president says he lacked clear knowledge of noriegas 
alleged drug involvement before the indictment three months ago 
his spokesman pete teeley says bush was aware of allegations but 
regarded them as unsubstantiated

the united states is trying to find out how 
several of its stinger antiaircraft missiles wound up in the tiny 
persian gulf state of qatar a top us official said tuesday 
assistant secretary of state richard murphy said the highly 
accurate shoulderfired rockets may have been passed to qatar by 
iran which in turn obtained them from the ussupplied afghan 
rebels 
murphy told a congressional hearing that the united states was 
seeking to get the missiles back and check their serial numbers 
against a list of stingers supplied overseas 
speaking later to reporters murphy said the handful of 
stingers had shown up about a month ago in a military parade in 
qatar he said the qataris had yet to agree to a us request to 
see the missiles we want to know how they got them he said 
murphy said the united states could not control black market 
leakages of weapons around the world despite a provision in its 
stinger contracts with other governments which forbids transfer of 
the missiles to a third party 
murphy noted that the stingers were considered an ideal 
terrorists weapon because they are easy to carry store and use 
he also pointed to congressional sensitivity on the stinger sales 
rep larry smith dfla asked murphy how the united states can 
keep track of the stingers despite its detailed inventories when 
the weapons are used by afghan rebels against soviet forces or 
chadian troops fighting libya 
murphy conceded that iran last year seized a shipment of 
stingers sent to the mujahedeen rebels in afghanistan fragments of 
stingers were found on an iranian speedboat that attacked us 
helicopters in the persian gulf last fall 
following that incident congress sought to prevent 
proliferation of the stingers by banning future us sales of the 
rocket but it made an exception for bahrain a neighbor of 
qatars to lease that country 70 stingers for 18 months as a 
defensive weapon against possible attacks by iran

the parliament voted tuesday to 
legalize beer after 73 years of prohibition but icelanders will 
have to wait 10 more months before they can quaff a cold one 
after a yearlong debate a full turnout of the upper house of 
icelands althing parliament voted 138 to stamp out the last 
vestiges of prohibition on the island and permit the sale of beer 
with an alcoholic content above 225 percent 
a dozen beerlovers flashed victory signs outside the althing 
after the postmidnight vote but there was little other public 
rejoicing 
the beer wont go on sale until march 1 and while no price has 
been set pro and antiprohibitionists both called for high 
prices fearing the change could encourage alcohol abuse 
former lawmaker jon magnusson who supported legalization said 
its very important that people realize that beer is just as 
dangerous as other alcohol 
leftwing althing member svavar gestsson who opposed 
legalization said this is a very unfortunate step and a 
dreadful experience for me both as a parent and a parliamentarian 
beer like other alcoholic drinks in iceland is expected to 
come under strict controls available only in bars and restaurants 
or state liquor stores which have a monopoly on retailing and close 
early 
the probeer lobby argued that legalization was inevitable 
given the bureaucratic tangle that prohibition has caused 
beer has always provoked ambivalent feelings among the 243000 
icelanders on the one hand beer is banned but on the other hand 
icelands national drink is a skullbashing distillation called 
black death 
the islanders voted in a 1908 referendum for a ban on all 
alcoholic drinks although it didnt take effect until jan 1 1915 
the ban was partially lifted after spain refused to buy 
icelands main export fish unless iceland bought spanish wines 
and in 1933 prohibition was repealed except for beer 
a powerful temperance movement continued to block the suds but 
the first crack appeared in 1980 businessman david scheving 
thorsteinsson went to court demanding the same rights as airline 
crews who were bringing in internationally approved allowances of 
dutyfree beer 
although thorsteinsson lost the publicity forced a change in 
the rules to allow icelanders arriving from abroad to bring in 122 
pints of foreign alcoholic beer 
this spurred local companies to brew their own alcoholic beers 
for sale at reykjaviks airport one of the few in the world which 
has a dutyfree store for incoming travelers 
the antiprohibition lobby returned to the warpath arguing that 
it was unconstitutional that icelanders who could afford foreign 
travel were entitled to buy beer 
when the latest bill entered parliament an opinion poll showed 
643 percent in favor of legalization when 16 doctors published 
newspaper ads warning of the health hazards 133 others riposted 
with ads saying alcoholism couldnt get worse if people switched 
from spirits to beer 
the bill passed in the lower house on april 18 by a 2317 vote 
with two members absent

president reagan said today he has not ruled 
out pardons for irancontra defendants oliver l north and john m 
poindexter 
reagan replied no when asked during a picturetaking session 
whether he had definitely ruled out the possibility of pardons for 
the two former white house aides 
reagan did not elaborate on the oneword answer but he said it 
with unusual emphasis 
syndicated columnist carl rowan reported monday after having 
lunch with the president that reagan has effectively ruled out 
pardons before trial of any of the defendants in the irancontra 
case and said the president will probably be out of office by the 
time the case is decided 
the president said he didnt believe in giving pardons before 
people are convicted of anything rowan related adding that 
reagan reasoned it leaves the cloud of guilt on through the 
years 
rowan reported on the presidents comments during an interview 
on wusatv in washington on monday evening the white house today 
released an excerpt of rowans interview 
it said that reagan replying to a question about pardons said 
you cant consider that carl until this case has been 
closed whichever way its going to go to pardon somebody before 
trial leaves a sense of guilt around them a cloud of guilt for the 
rest of time and so this is something that i dont have to face 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater asked to reconcile 
rowans report and the presidents response today said i told 
you it wasnt definitive it means theres been no decision 
you got a yes and a no which means no definitive decision 
has been made 
earlier today fitzwater said he would not interpret reagans 
comments 
i have not talked to the president about it fitzwater said 
i want to be fair to you i think that there has not been a 
definitive decision made on pardons i dont believe 
however the language is here it is plain and it did come 
from the president fitzwater added so you can interpret that 
as good reporeters however you like but i simply cannot go beyond 
it 
at issue is whether reagan will consider either pretrial or 
posttrial pardons of poindexter former national security adviser 
north a former national security council staffer retired air 
force maj gen richard v secord and his business partner albert 
hakim 
the four are charged with conspiring to illegally divert profits 
from the usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
according to a transcript of a court hearing released monday a 
compromise has been reached in the defense effort to review 
ultrasensitive government documents related to the case 
under the agreement north poindexter and their lawyers will 
review a small group of documents 
hakim secord and their lawyers will not see the documents they 
agreed in a hearing friday to rely on the judgment of the lawyers 
for poindexter and north 
us district judge gerhard a gesell is allowing the defense to 
review the material to verify prosecution claims that it is not 
relevant to the charges 
the defense concession does not dispose of the larger problem of 
disclosing sensitive information that may be determined to be 
relevant when the case goes to trial 
gesell issued an order monday giving independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh until may 30 to draw up a list of secret 
documents he wants to use as evidence that wont be declassified by 
the government

the reagan administration has received reports 
that the palestine liberation organization might target americans 
for attack because of alleged us involvement in the murder of a 
highlevel plo official congress was told tuesday 
assistant secretary of state richard murphy said the united 
states had received such reports following last months 
assassination of khalil wazir the plos secondincommand also 
known as abu jihad israel is believed to have carried out that 
assassination in tunis 
the reports were serious enough to not take a chance by 
ignoring them he told reporters following a congressional hearing 
there was no specific target but the reports had plausibility 
because of the abu jihad murder he said 
specifically the united states is concerned about the reports 
because of accusations by the plo that the united states knew about 
and even approved wazirs assassination murphy said 
as a result several american ambassadors in arab countries were 
asked to discuss the us concerns verbally with authorities there 
murphy said 
there was no us letter murphy said 
one arab government conveyed the us concerns to the plo and 
plo chairman yasser arafat decided to go public with this 
murphy told the house foreign affairs subcommittee on arms control 
international security and science 
murphy denied arafats accusations that the united states had 
made veiled threats to assassinate plo leaders if the plo attacked 
us targets 
i assume you deny this he was asked by rep lawrence smith 
dfla 
of course murphy responded 
at the state department meanwhile spokesman charles redman 
said the administration had made contact with a number of middle 
eastern countries as a prudent response to infomation available 
to us concerning possible attacks 
he said arafats interpretation of the us contacts was 
entirely without foundation 
murphy did not name the arab intermediary but in the past the 
united states has conveyed messages to the plo through tunisia 
where the plo established its headquarters after being expelled by 
israel from lebanon in 1982 
the united states repeatedly has denied any involvement in the 
commando raid on abu jihads tunis home deputy secretary of state 
john whitehead said monday he would stress this point in his talks 
later this week with tunisian leaders in tunis 
the state departments top counterterrorism expert l paul 
bremer said in an interview two weeks ago that the united states 
expects increased palestinian terrorism in the wake of the abu 
jihad assassination and the fivemonth palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip

frances new premier michel rocard is ambitious 
pragmatic nondoctrinaire and one of the nations most popular 
politicians 
rocard was appointed tuesday by president francois mitterrand to 
lead the new government the 57yearold rocard will now get a 
chance to demonstrate whether the consistently high scores he gets 
in public opinion polls are matched by talent 
his way wont be easy 
rocard a socialist will be trying to run a government 
dominated by his party yet develop policies attractive to 
centrists whose support his administration needs meanwhile he 
will have to get along with mitterrand who has been his rival for 
a decade 
rocard has run for president three times for this election he 
had announced a year ago that he planned to run for the job but 
stepped aside when it became clear last month that mitterrand was 
going to be a candidate 
whatever happens rocard told a newspaper recently i know 
that one day i will go to the elysee palace the seat of the 
french presidency 
for the moment rocard will have to be content with the hotel 
matignon the prime ministers office on the left bank of the seine 
a darkeyed chain smoker with impish features rocard is far 
better known at home than abroad in the past year however he has 
met with president reagan and british prime minister margaret 
thatcher 
rocard has said frances foreign policy would remain unchanged 
under the socialists and that he would continue to assert the 
countrys special independent stance within the atlantic alliance 
he supports greater european and transatlantic cooperation 
through quiet consultations to discuss defense questions such as 
the continuing presence of us troops in europe 
rocard believes that europeans should assume a greater share of 
the defense burden but not under the threat of a withdrawal of 
us troops 
on economic issues rocard has called himself a free 
enterprise leftist who believes in the welfare state 
france needs to find a future he said in a campaign speech 
to become a more dynamic france a more just france a more 
convincing france 
he says the conservatives who had been in power since 1986 
have been hasty in selling off stateowned companies to private 
investors a better policy he has said would be to allow these 
companies to raise capital so that they could grow and create jobs 
one of the greatest challenges facing the new premier is 
frances 103 percent unemployment 
rocard says he believes in greater international cooperation in 
coordinating the economies of the industrialized nations he also 
favors helping third world nations ease their debt 
rocard was born in courbevoie a suburb west of paris the son 
of a scientist who helped develop frances atomic bomb 
after living in colonial algeria rocard turned to the political 
left in the 1960s he was a student activist using an alias 
because at the same time he was working his way through the 
countrys elite professional schools including the ecole nationale 
dadministration a training ground for french politicians 
after the left lost parliamentary elections in 1978 rocard 
worked to sustain and modernize the socialist party at a party 
congress after the elections he boosted morale with a stirring 
speech that said socialism was still viable 
he then worked to get the party to reject marxist terminology 
and accept concepts such as the role of market forces in an 
advanced economy 
increasingly influential in the party rocard was mentioned as a 
possible choice for premier after mitterrand won his first term in 
1981 instead he was appointed minister of state for planning and 
then minister of agriculture in 1983 
two years later he resigned in a dramatic and wellpublicized 
falling out with mitterrand 
rocard is a protestant in a roman catholic nation who enjoys 
sailing and skiing he and his wife have two children in their 20s 
he is also the mayor of the working class town of conflans st 
honorine northwest of paris

another top presidential adviser has unleashed 
an account of his white house years but scandalhunters will have 
to look elsewhere pierre salinger has little but praise for john 
f kennedy 
salinger who was kennedys press secretary says the slain 
president was a special man who surrounded himself with 
advisers who believed in each other and in a common mission 
there was no barrier on the presidents door salinger 
writes in the june issue of mccalls magazine any of his dozen 
principal staffers could see him when they wanted to they didnt 
need permission from a chief of staff to gain access 
kennedy says salinger was not a perfect man for all his 
loftiness of purpose he did not take himself that seriously he 
had no great vision of himself as a political or intellectual 
giant 
but salinger now with abc news says kennedy learned from his 
mistakes 
one measure of kennedys growth in office will be revealed this 
november when private correspondence between kennedy and soviet 
leader nikita krushchev is scheduled to be released salinger says 
as one who has read most of them i believe they will be a 
stunning revelation of two leaders of confrontational powers 
groping toward understanding he writes

hundreds of workers ended their eightday 
strike without a settlement tonight leaving the lenin shipyard 
carrying a cross and the polish flag and led by solidarity founder 
lech walesa 
police stood back silently and let the workers pass as they 
walked slowly and calmly out of the shipyard shortly after 8 pm 
many workers carried luggage and boxes 
the workers were applauded by bystanders as they exited and 
some bystanders rushed forward and joined the workers procession 
many of the workers had been in the shipyard since may 2 when 
the strike for higher pay and union rights began 
earlier today the strikers accepted a strike committee proposal 
to end their work stoppage a cameraman said and a solidarity 
banner was taken off the front gate of the shipyard 
strike spokesman adam michnik read a workers statement saying 
we are leaving the shipyard not in triumph but with raised 
heads 
just before the workers ended their strike gdansk bishop 
tadeusz goclowski called gen jerzy andrzejewski and demanded the 
removal of the police blockade around the shipyard saying the 
workers were coming out according to michnik 
andrzejewski was commanding the security forces at the shipyard 
which has been surrounded by police since thursday 
strike talks broke off monday after strikers rejected a 
management offer attempts by a church mediator to persuade 
management to resume talks were proving unsuccessful said michnik 
after the alleged detention and beating of two couriers in 
gdansk strikers complained earlier today that it was becoming more 
and more difficult to get food supplies from outside the shipyard 
the shipyard work stoppage was the last strike in a string of 
five that began april 25 the countrys worst wave of labor unrest 
since the 1981 martial law crackdown 
i think we accomplished something we gained general agreement 
on the other side that we exist said piotr konopka an aide to 
walesa 
walesa said monday he and hundreds of workers at the lenin 
shipyard were determined to hold out for their demands well 
win well win 700 strikers shouted during a rally at the 
shipyard 
meanwhile in warsaw opposition activists and workers reported 
a strike starting monday at the ursus tractor factory on the 
outskirts of the capital but officials denied there was a strike 
and the report could not be verified 
strikers at the gdansk shipyard rejected a management offer of 
pay raises and reinstatement of some fired activists because the 
deal did not include a legally recognized chapter of solidarity 
the independent union the first in the soviet bloc was 
outlawed after martial law was declared dec 13 1981 
polands communist government never ruled out using force to end 
the strike a predawn police raid last thursday crushed a 10day 
strike by steel workers at nowa huta in southern poland

a fourterm congressman challenged nebraska sen david karnes 
and a millionaire businessman tried to wrest the nomination from 
west virginia gov arch moore as voters settled hotly contested 
republican primaries tuesday 
karnes faced rep hal daub after a bitter divisive campaign 
with polls suggesting a close finish the winner could expect a 
tough fight in november against popular exgov bob kerrey whose 
only democratic opponent was disbarred lawyer ken michaelis 
karnes the nations youngest senator at 39 was appointed to 
the office 14 months ago and the primary marked his first bid for 
elective office 
moore seeking a record fourth term was opposed by john raese 
who accused the incumbent of failing to deal with west virginias 
financial problems 
seven democrats sought the gubernatorial nomination most 
prominently former house of delegates speaker clyde see and 
charleston insurance executive gaston caperton who waged a war of 
negative tv campaign ads 
west virginia also had a senate primary with majority leader 
robert c byrd seeking a sixth term and expected to dispatch a 
democratic challenger moving company owner bob myers in the gop 
primary state sen jay wolfe faced welfare recipient bernie 
lumbert

karnes was a political unknown when republican gov kay orr 
appointed him after edward zorinskys death daub 47 was one of 
several gop regulars who lobbied for the job and he acknowledged 
bitterness at being passed over despite having carried water for 
the elephant for 20 years 
daub mounted an aggressive campaign referring to karnes as my 
appointed opponent and last week charging that he was a rubber 
stamp for mrs orr and president reagan 
karnes who said he wanted to run a class campaign refused 
to be drawn into namecalling and mrs orr said it was sad 
that daub resorted to desperate tactics 
an omaha worldherald poll taken the week before the primary 
showed 41 percent preferred karnes 40 percent backed daub and the 
remainder were undecided a lincoln journal poll found daub leading 
karnes 42 percent to 41 percent with 17 percent undecided the 
margins of error in the polls were 4 and 64 percentage points 
respectively 
the 44yearold kerrey has been a highly successful democrat in 
a state where 51 percent of registered voters are republicans a 
congressional medal of honor winner who lost part of a leg in 
vietnam he was elected governor in 1982 carried on a widely 
publicized romance with movie star debra winger and chose not to 
run for reelection in 1986 
in west virginia raese accused moore of waging a rose 
garden campaign refusing to debate and relying on his office to 
carry him through the election 
moore 65 boasted of having cut taxes by 311 million in the 
past four years although he fought most of the cuts when they were 
imposed by the legislature he also cited his accomplishments at 
bringing business and 30000 jobs to the state although the number 
of employed west virginians has increased by just 5700 since 1985 
nbc broadcast a report sunday in which former mingo county 
political boss johnie owens said that in 1972 moore offered to pay 
him 12000 to include him on a list of recommended candidates a 
moore spokesman called the report a piece of garbage 
the 38yearold raese who has a reputation of a rich kid 
who loves fast boats and hard living lost his first bid for office 
in a 1984 senate race to another millionaire jay rockefeller 
see 46 criticized capertons refusal to sign a voluntary 
campaign spending limit and cited a study that found a 25 percent 
error rate in state claims processed by capertons insurance 
company the nations 18th largest 
caperton 48 defended his business achievements and accused see 
of oldstyle politics and a dirty campaign full of 
distortion 
byrd said that if he is reelected and the democrats retain 
control of the senate he will give up the majority leaders job to 
become appropriations committee chairman hoping to steer more 
federal dollars to west virginia 
the last senator defeated in a primary was sen richard stone a 
florida democrat who lost in a 1980 runoff to bill gunter gunter 
was defeated that november by republican paula hawkins 
the last governor to lose in a primary was gov edwin w 
edwards a louisiana democrat who finished second to charles e 
buddy roemer iii in a nonpartisan primary last october rather 
than go through with a runoff edwards withdrew from the race 
in 1986 gov william j sheffield of alaska lost the democratic 
primary to stephen c cowper who is now governor

the tale of the starstruck reagans rolled across 
the front pages of europe this week drawing jokes and jibes along 
the way and even surfaced on the floor of britains house of 
commons 
i come under libra which is a very balanced sign declared 
prime minister margaret thatcher when asked by a lighthearted 
fellow conservative lawmaker whether she planned to move an 
astrologer into her no 10 downing st residence 
mrs thatcher 62 was born oct 13 under libra the sign of 
the scales 
the allegations by former white house chief of staff donald 
regan about the role the zodiac played in the reagan white house 
are giving europes cartoonists punsters and humorists a lot of 
fun 
advice on star wars from the stars themselves headlined 
west germanys frankfurt rundschau newspaper 
the starspangled planner sniped londons independent 
le monde frances most prestigious paper ran a cartoon asking 
an astrologer how come you didnt predict regans book 
regans book was preceeded by several other books and articles 
by former close associates of the president most notably a recent 
book by expresidential spokesman larry speakes 
in his book speakes said he made up quotes for the president 
without checking them with reagan 
the issue of kissandtell or spitandtell as londons 
guardian put it doesnt interest many europeans many governments 
bind employees to lifetime oaths of confidence that make such 
revelations difficult 
one family that has suffered the scourge is britains royals 
the family also imposes oaths of confidence and in 1983 it 
resorted to the unprecedented tactic of suing a former buckingham 
palace kitchen worker and the tabloid sun which was serializing 
his memoirs the sun settled out of court and scrapped the series 
i understand what nancy reagan was doing my wife does the 
same thing but taking an opinion from an astrologer is one thing 
and basing decisionmaking on him or her is quite another said a 
greek parliamentarian who declined to be named 
greek fortuneteller fortoula a 50year veteran medium claims 
to have been consulted in her basement apartment near the 
parliament in athens by several prime ministers and i dont know 
how many cabinet ministers from greece egypt and lebanon during 
her career 
why not politicians in government need the advice of all 
sorts of people she said 
west germanys bild newspaper quoted foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher as saying he reads the horoscopes daily but 
doesnt believe in them 
it is interesting to learn what i supposedly face day by 
day he said 
defense minister manfred woerner was quoted as saying 
astrology is very interesting but personally i would rather 
place my fate in the hands of our loving god 
dutch astrologer jacques chandu said he frequently advises 
politicians on party matters but declined to name names he said 
mrs reagan had given his trade a boost 
but s schouten of utrecht universitys parapsychology 
department said he doubted astrology played a role in dutch 
politics 
switzerlands conservative newspaper neue zuercher zeitung 
predicted the astrology story would haunt the reagans the way jimmy 
carter suffered from his story about confronting a giant killer 
rabbit 
londons leftofcenter guardian said it was glad there is one 
date that not even mrs reagans astrologers can postpone the date 
of the next presidential election

a senior reagan administration official voiced 
confidence tuesday that secretary of state george p shultz would 
be able to clear up differences over a missileban treaty with the 
soviet union in a new round of talks with foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze 
the differences over policing the accord against cheating 
prompted senate leaders on monday to indefinitely postpone 
ratification 
these are very very technical issues and weve had the 
problem of pursuing them at long distance through diplomatic 
exchange informal translations things of that sort the 
official told reporters before shultz boarded an air force jet for 
two days of talks with shevardnadze in geneva 
there may in fact be differences but i am quite confident 
that if you get all of the right people in the city at the expert 
level with the ministers watching over the process that well be 
able to nail these things down said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
however shevardnadze said on his arrival in geneva tuesday that 
he was not quite clear what the problems were he said the 
soviets had answered questions raised by the united states about 
monitoring the agreement to scrap all us and soviet missiles with 
a range of 315 to 3125 miles 
basically the verification problems regarding the inf treaty 
have been resolved i think shevardnadze said 
the soviet answers were delivered to the state department sunday 
night by ambassador yuri v dubinin and presented monday to the 
senate intelligence committee where they received a chilly 
reception 
subsequently senate democratic and republican leaders decided 
to postpone debate over ratification which had been scheduled to 
begin wednesday 
sen robert c byrd of west virginia the democratic leader 
said the treaty would remain on the back burner until the 
differences were resolved 
we dont want to give the soviets loopholes to cheat he 
said this obviously needs fixing and the time to fix it is 
before the senate takes up the treaty 
byrd appealed to the kremlin to take steps to end the dispute 
holding up the treaty the soviets hold the key he told the 
senate 
there are nine technical issues in dispute the two most 
significant involve soviet attempts to restrict us inspection of 
missile containers and the range of access for us monitoring 
personnel within designated areas 
even if shultz and shevardnadze resolve the differences in 
geneva where they reached final agreement on the treaty last 
november it was not clear whether the senate would be able or 
willing to ratify the accord before president reagans visit to 
moscow starting may 29 
another dispute erupted meanwhile as the soviets asserted a 
right to inspect west german pershing 1a missiles that are stored 
in the united states the rockets have a range of 465 miles within 
the span of the treaty and the nuclear warheads are owned by the 
united states 
state department spokesman charles e redman called the soviet 
demand sopmething we find astonishing that they should choose to 
raise that issue 
meanwhile white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
senate decision to postpone debate on the treaty is a prudent and 
reasonable course of action 
there is unanimity between the administration and the 
bipartisan senate leadership that these problems should be 
satisfactorily and promptly resolved prior to ratification he 
said the administration has made clear to the soviets the need 
for an expeditious solution 
fitzwater said we hope to resolve these issues quickly were 
still of the view that it is possible to have the treaty ratified 
prior to the moscow summit 
reagan had hoped in his fourth and probably final meeting with 
general secretary mikhail s gorbachev to sign a far more 
significant treaty to reduce us and soviet longrange nuclear 
weapons by 30 to 50 percent 
the senior us official who briefed reporters at the state 
department acknowledged that hope for such a pact had about run 
out the official said reagan and gorbachev would issue a joint 
statement identifying in some way where we are on arms control 
and other issues 
the idea would be for the president who succeeds reagan in 
january to pick up from there 
after an allnight flight shultz planned to hold two meetings 
with shevardnadze on wednesday and two more on thursday before 
flying to brussels on friday to brief the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
us and soviet arms control experts will meet separately in 
geneva under the supervision of shultz and shevardnadze 
of the nonnuclear issues on shultzs agenda the two likely to 
get the most attention were human rights and southern africa 
human rights issues to be discussed may include an effort to 
form an opposition party in the soviet union which has encountered 
resistance from soviet authorities 
we regret that when soviet citizens try to involve themselves 
directly in democracy that they are harassed and arrrested 
redman said 
on southern africa the united states has been attempting for 
years to negotiate the withdrawal of more than 40000 cuban troops 
from angola as well as independence and black majority rule for 
south africancontrolled namibia 
one hopeful sign was an unprecedented meeting last week in 
london involving officials from the united states angola south 
africa and cuba us officials have said the meeting left the 
impression among some that there is a new political will among 
parties to the conflicts to reach a settlement

scientists have identified a brain chemical that 
causes panic attacks when injected into panic attack patients 
suggesting the substance may play a role in the disorder that 
afflicts 12 million americans 
all 11 panic attack patients given cholecystokinin intravenously 
suffered attacks beginning an average of 20 seconds after the 
injection said jacques bradwejn of mcgill university in montreal 
the patients said the symptoms occurred in the same order as in 
spontaneous attacks he said 
bradwejn reported the study tuesday at the american psychiatric 
associations annual meeting 
panic attacks strike victims with overwhelming terror for no 
apparent reason 
attacks can include such symptoms as sweating heart 
palpitations trembling shortness of breath choking sensations 
faintness and fear of losing control or of dying 
the first attack usually occurs by the victims late 20s and 
episodes can recur several times a week even daily the disorder 
can last for years with varying periods of remission or 
exacerbation 
if not treated panic sufferers can become suicidal 
researchers can trigger panic attacks in patients by exposing 
them to carbon dioxide or other substances not found in the brain 
cholecystokinins normal role appears to be helping brain and 
nerve cells communicate bradwejn said its possible role in panic 
attacks was suggested by experiments showing that its effect on 
nerve cells was blocked by antipanic medication he said 
in the new study each patient received injections on each of 
two days one day they received cholecystokinin the other day an 
inert salt solution no patient had an attack after the salt 
solution 
attacks induced by the brain substance lasted about 21 minutes 
give or take about eight minutes bradwejn said 
besides normal symptoms some patients reported blurred vision 
a warmth in the throat or chest a bitter taste or a prickling in 
the throat he said 
if cholecystokinin plays a role in spontaneous attacks he said 
it is not clear whether the attacks are produced by a surge of its 
natural levels or an abnormally high sensitivity to it 
marcus raichle of washington university in st louis who has 
studied brain abnormalities in panic disorder said the next step 
will be to see how the locations of cholecystokinin in the brain 
correspond to the nerve circuitry that connects to areas implicated 
in the disorder

a teenager was sentenced tuesday to 52 
years and eight months in prison for the slayings of three people 
after authorities reported the youth felt remorse because he had 
lost his friends over the deaths 
superior court judge james roach said it was obvious that the 
defendant kenneth bivert 18 had not assumed responsibility for 
the death of the three people 
roach read from a youth authority report that said that bivert 
had said he was sorry but had not displayed evidence of his 
ability to empathize 
the report quoted bivert as saying that the worst thing that 
happened was that i lost 95 percent of my friends over this 
the judge said he gave bivert the maximum sentence possible 
under a plea bargain 
bivert who pleaded guilty last january and anthony king 17 
were charged with shooting to death steve patton 35 of west 
sacramento and dawn and raymond rogers of woodland 
bivert testified that the three were killed to obtain their cars 
for a bank robbery that never took place 
king is awaiting trial 
public defender lou haffner said bivert will be eligible for 
parole in 26 years and four months but he said it may be 30 or 40 
years before his client is released

the united states on tuesday vetoed a 
security council resolution that condemned israels recent raid 
into south lebanon and called for israel to withdraw from lebanon 
and all occupied territories 
the vote was 141 despite efforts to moderate the resolution to 
avoid a us veto 
the united states frequently exercises its veto to kill 
resolutions critical of the jewish state 
the vote came after a threeday debate requested by lebanon 
which protested the twoday incursion 
us ambassador vernon a walters explaining the us veto 
said the security council should not discuss southern lebanon in 
resolutions that fail to recognize the attacks and reprisals 
originating on both sides of the israelilebanese border 
he said that armed palestinians supported by proiranian 
groups repeatedly have tried to enter israel from lebanon in the 
last four months to carry out violent acts 
we cannot accept a resolution that does not acknowledge the 
wellknown fact that hostile acts against israel are originating in 
lebanon he said 
walters said the united states supports the independence 
territorial integrity and unity of lebanon washington has called 
for withdrawal of all foreign forces and the extension of central 
government authority throughout that country he said 
but he said the sad truth remains that as long as armed 
extremist elements use southern lebanon to stage terrorist attacks 
against israel the border cannot be secure 
british ambassador john birch the deputy permanent 
representative said the resolution failed to consider attacks 
against israel and hostilities on both sides of the 
israelilebanese border but he said israels latest incursion has 
done damage to its cause and said britain would vote for the 
resolution in view of the excesses of israel 
israel said the twoday operation last week was necessary to 
root out terrorists who stage attacks against israel from lebanese 
territory 
israel said three israeli soldiers and more than 40 arab 
guerrillas died in two days of fighting in south lebanon last week 
the meeting tuesday was the sixth security council meeting in 
six months called to deplore israels handling of the palestinian 
uprising its deportation of palestinians its military actions in 
south lebanon and the assassination of a plo leader in tunisia that 
has been blamed on israel 
in addition to the united states the security council members 
are britain china france and the soviet union the five 
permanent members with veto power and algeria argentina brazil 
italy japan nepal senegal west germany yugoslavia and zambia

an eye while attending a performance by the heavy metal rock band 
a civil lawsuit that went to trial this week seeks 22 million 
for robert miller 17 of athens who lost an eye and 400000 for 
david wright 19 of grant who had his lip split 
jim alexander the teenagers attorney said in his opening 
statement monday that flying debris hit his clients during the 
sept 25 1985 concert in huntsville 
but an attorney for motley crue inc told jurors there were no 
explosives onstage that could propel objects through the air 
stanley rogers said the two teenagers got hurt out there and 
we cant explain it but it did not come from special effects 
nikki sixx a member of motley crue sat quietly in limestone 
county circuit court during jury selection sixx is president of 
motley crue inc 
sitting across the room was miller whose injury occurred at his 
first concert a birthday present from his parents just days before 
his 15th birthday miller was permanently blinded in his right eye 
from an object that came shooting off the stage alexander said 
miller has said the material that struck him was similar to dry 
ice which alexander said was being used to create a smoke effect 
the defendants say they are not responsible for injuries 
suffered by miller and wright 
the city of huntsville von braun civic center and sound 70 
productions inc of nashville are also defendants

democratic leaders tuesday prepared to send 
the omnibus trade bill to president reagan this week for an 
expected veto after efforts to erase its alaska oil provisions 
proved futile 
i had hoped that if these offending provisions had been 
eliminated the president would have had one less reason for vetoing 
this bill senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said 
after a move to drop the oil provisions was thwarted 
labor leaders clergymen and other supporters of the 1000page 
bill were invited to a wednesday ceremony at which house speaker 
jim wright dtexas planned to sign the bill 
it won final passage in the senate on april 27 but instead of 
being sent to reagans desk has been becalmed on capitol hill while 
leaders have sought to do a bit of afterthefact tailoring 
byrd on tuesday sought unanimous consent to take up a technical 
resolution that would have erased the bills restrictions on 
exports of alaska oil 
the technical resolution approved last week by the house would 
have instructed an official known as the enrolling clerk to dot is 
and cross some ts in the bill and erase the alaska oil 
provisions at the same time 
unlike house leaders however byrd needed to obtain unanimous 
consent before bringing the resolution to the floor 
minority leader bob dole rkan said there were a number of 
objections among republicans to bringing up the resolution 
doing so without a time limit dole added would merely launch a 
long string of amendments involving complex issues ranging from 
plantclosings to caribbean ethanol imports 
we would have a fullscale trade debate here for several 
days he said 
that appeared to end the effort to strike the oil exports curbs 
one of two features reagan has said would justify his planned veto 
the other is a provision that would require companies with 100 or 
more employees to provide 60day notice of plantclosings and 
largescale layoffs 
one of the alaska provisions would limit exports from new alaska 
refineries to 70000 barrels a day and 50 percent of total output 
the other would clear the way for export to canada of 50000 
barrels of crude daily but it would require that the oil be 
transported first in an american vessel to a west coast port in the 
lower 48 states such as seattle and then reshipped 
the features are favorites of maritime unions and similar 
versions appear in the currently pending uscanada freetrade 
agreement critics have said that they violate a constitutional ban 
on discrimination against one states port to the advantage of 
another states port

abby hoffman no longer wants 
action from his audiences reaction will do

hoffman 51 who gained notoriety as one of the chicago seven 
defendants charged with inciting riots at the 1968 democratic 
national convention says he is discovering that middle age isnt 
any easier for a yippie than it is for a yuppie 
it isnt a bowl of cherries hoffman said in a recent

the environmental activist speaks at more than 50 university 
campuses a year at 3000 an appearance but he was in this town 
55 miles southeast of los angeles on tuesday for a comedy gig at 
the coach house 
this isnt new this comedy stuff because i was a bit of a 
standup comedian during the 60s said hoffman who offered a 
pig as a presidential candidate during the 1968 elections 
hoffman said the coach house appearance was his fourth as a 
comedian in the past two years 
the difference is that in the 60s they shot and threw bags 
of garbage at me so this seems pretty tame by comparison he

by the states reckoning when this farming

unwittingly exempted the town accountant in framingham from civil 
service

discovered the mixup when a resident asked to check the original 
wording of the hadley resolutions 
the measures hadley thought it passed were apparently 
transformed into a quite different chapter and section of town law 
by keypunching errors after the actions of the town meetings in 
hadley haverhill and framingham were compiled and submitted to the 
attorney general for review she said 
our intent in passing the measures was clear but something 
happened there was a typo or an error at the printers that no one 
caught in proofreading and they didnt exist she said 
undaunted hadley voters have tried again 
we brought both issues back to the floor of the town meeting 
and they were approved again last thursday night ms devine said

reputed colombian drug kingpin carlos 
lehder rivas saw cocaine as a revolutionary weapon against the 
united states a prosecutor said tuesday in final arguments in 
lehders cocainesmuggling trial 
hes still at war us attorney robert merkle told the 
jury he hasnt stopped 
lehder considered cocaine a weapon and you see where his 
missiles landed merkle said pointing to a map showing where 
lehder allegedly had cocaine flown into the united states 
merkle holding a tiny cocaine spoon said the government had 
proved that lehder imported 18000 kilograms or about 39600 
pounds of the powder into the united states he asked the jury to 
consider how much time it would take to dip out that amount a 
spoonful at a time he then provided an answer 
more time that you have remaining on this earth 
a cart holding 277 pounds of cocaine stood beside him as he 
spoke 
authorities say lehder 38 is a leader of the socalled 
medellin cartel believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the 
cocaine smuggled into the united states prosecutors have said he 
is charged with bringing 33 tons of cocaine into the united states 
from 1978 to 1980 paying bribes and making threats to use normans 
cay in the bahamas as a private relay station 
carlos lehder and henry ford had a lot in common merkle 
said carlos lehder was the pioneer of the mass transporation of 
cocaine for the american consumer 
the prosecutor also referred to old tv interviews of lehder 
played during the trial telling jurors to take the defendant at 
his word 
he told you cocaine has become a revolutionary weapon to 
destroy the us empire said merkle the end justifies the 
means 
defense attorneys who rested without calling witnesses were 
expected to close wednesday 
merkle blasted defense arguments that lehder had been used by 
convicted smuggler and key prosecution witness ed ward 
ed ward is not the king of cocaine the prosecutor said 
adding that to equate lehders organization to wards group of 
american smugglers was like comparing the boston red sox to the 
little league 
merkle also pointed to acts of violence laid to lehder and 
referred to a september 1978 meeting in which lehder reportedly 
said every once in a while in this business someone has to die 
merkle also mentioned threats to those who ventured to normans 
cay including former cbs anchorman walter cronkite 
a total of 115 government witnesses many of them convicted 
smugglers depicted lehder as a flamboyant womanizing neonazi 
who used money and force to build a cocainesmuggling kingdom on 
the bahamian island 
the jury which heard 22 weeks of testimony likely will get the 
case friday and begin its deliberations on the 11count indictment 
that charges lehder with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise 
if convicted lehder faces up to life plus 165 years in prison 
and the forfeiture of his assets in the bahamas to the us 
government 
codefendant jack carlton reed 57 of san pedro calif is 
charged with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy he faces 
up to 15 years in prison

attorney general edwin meese iii is 
designating a top justice department official to help end a turf 
war between the fbi and the marshals service over the pursuit of 
fugitives a department spokesman said tuesday 
under the arrangement meese is trying to settle the 
longstanding feud by having acting associate attorney general 
francis keating arbitrate individual disagreements over whether the 
fbi or marshals service will handle a particular fugitive 
investigation 
the marshals service has been increasingly successful under a 
1979 agreement with the fbi in tracking down fugitives but the fbi 
has said the marshals have expanded their role too far 
sources at the fbi and marshals service speaking on condition 
of anonymity said little appears to have changed under meeses 
decision and that the main alteration has been to set up a dispute 
mechanism in the associate attorney generals office 
meese told fbi director william sessions last week the bureau 
generally retains jurisdiction of tracking down escapees who fled 
after being arrested but before going to trial said justice 
department spokesman terry eastland 
meese told marshals service chief stanley morris that his agency 
retains jurisdiction over the apprehension of fugitives who escaped 
after being convicted eastland said 
under meeses decision the fbi generally would have 
jurisdiction over all fugitives whether in the pre or 
postconviction phase involved in foreign counterintelligence 
cases organized crime or terrorism 
but if the marshals service has made major progress on a 
fugitive case it might ask to assist or take over an fbi fugitive 
investigation said eastland 
in addition the fbi may ask the marshals service to turn over 
jurisdiction over an investigation involving a fugitive who has 
been convicted but who has committed new crimes after fleeing 
the sources said the attorney generals decision leaves the door 
open contingent on the approval of the associate attorney 
generals office for the marshals service to continue aggressive 
pursuit in the types of investigations that led to the apprehension 
of edwin wilson 
wilson is an excia official who was sought for training libyan 
terrorists and supplying them with explosives the marshals lured 
wilson to the dominican republic and put him on a flight to the 
united states where he was arrested

your efforts on behalf of us all during the past four years 
has set a new standard reagan told carrington who will be 
succeeded at the end of his term in june by west german defense 
minister manfred woerner 
your stewardship of the alliance has continued a lifes work 
in support of human decency and the ideal of freedom the very 
basis of the compact for peace that we call nato the president 
said in presenting him the medal the nations highest civilian 
award 
reagan said carrington had done a good job of bringing together 
the views of north atlantic treaty organization members 
reconciling the occasionally differing views of the european 
members of the alliance with those of the north americans is a 
special challenge he said but one of your special gifts has 
always been an ability to find common ground and nowhere is that 
more important than at nato you believed in nato when it counted 
and that spirit has been contagious 
it has been your gift of statesmanship which has brought our 
transatlantic partnership to a level of unity and common purpose 
unparalleled in the history of nato reagan said 
some 75 presidential medals of freedom have been awarded by 
reagan but few of them for nonus citizens among the foreigners 
to have been honored were anwar sadat the former president of 
egypt who was given the award posthumously joseph luns 
carringtons predecessor at nato and cellist mstislav rostropovich 
carrington paid tribute to the president for supporting the 
alliance and keeping americas defense strong

beverly sills the new york city operas 
longtime star soprano who took over the company and helped rescue 
it from financial disaster announced tuesday that she will retire 
at the end of the year 
i think 10 years is long enough miss sills said of her 
second career as general director of the nations secondlargest 
opera company in terms of budget and number of performances 
she said she thought it was important that a new fiveyear plan 
be created to guide the company and noting she will be 60 next 
spring said i dont think this young vital company should be 
run by a 65yearold woman 
miss sills said a search for her successor would begin soon and 
that upon her retirement she would become president of the 
companys board and would continue to help raise funds 
she met with reporters at the new york state theater where the 
new york city opera performs in lincoln center next door to the 
metropolitan opera house 
the theater was the scene of many of her triumphs during a 
20year singing career that included such widely varying roles as 
the doomed maiden of donizettis lucia di lammermoor and the 
romantic heroine of massenets manon 
but it was her managerial triumphs that took center stage 
tuesday 
robert wilson chairman of the board said that when miss sills 
became head of the company taking over from julius rudel we 
hardly had enough money to meet the payroll it was a close call 
now we have a surplus of 3 million he said for the last 
five years weve been operating profitably 
the companys budget for fiscal 1989 which begins july 1 is 
projected at 26 million in 1978 when she took over the budget 
was nearly 9 million 
wilson also said performing standards had risen under miss 
sills regime and that she had achieved artistic revival with 
demonic determination to control costs 
he praised miss sills introduction of english surtitles above 
the stage her combining spring and fall seasons into one season 
and her finding financing for five years of a spring musical comedy 
season 
during her tenure as general director miss sills has emphasized 
the engagement of young american singers and american conductors 
designers and directors she has stressed acting as well as singing 
miss sills said she was considering various plans for the 
future but insisted she would never go to work for another opera 
company 
the profitmaking world seems awfully attractive to me she 
said you arent out with a tin cup i have been offered a talk 
show i might do that she also said she planned to take a 
little vacation with my husband when the dust settles and see if he 
can remember what my first name is 
though she sang in europe and made her debut at the metropolitan 
opera in 1975 most of her singing career was at the new york state 
opera she starred in the new york premiere of douglas moores 
the ballad of baby doe in 1958 and shot to acclaim in 1966 when 
she sang cleopatra opposite bassbaritone norman treigle in 
handels julius caesar 
the warmth of her stage personality made the title role of 
manon her best role audiences also loved her in lucia di 
lammermoor and the daughter of the regiment she took on a 
harder challenge and triumphed when she sang donizettis three 
tudor queens elizabeth in roberto devereux maria stuarda 
and anna bolena

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said 
tuesday that he doesnt understand why the us senate has not 
ratified an arms control treaty that bans medium and shorterrange 
nuclear weapons 
us officials said however that a dispute has arisen over 
verification issues 
basically the verification problems regarding the inf treaty 
have been resolved i think shevardnadze said after arriving at 
genevas cointrin airport 
the soviet foreign minister begins a twoday meeting with 
secretary of state george shultz here on wednesday 
shevardnadzes statement contrasted with remarks by senate 
majority leader robert byrd dwva in washington who said a 
serious dispute had broken out over verification issues 
the verification dispute centers primarily on us allegations 
that the soviets are trying to restrict access by us monitors to 
soviet missile plants and sites 
the intermediate nuclear forces accord which bans nuclear 
missiles with a range of about 300 to 3000 miles was signed dec 
8 by president reagan and soviet communist party leader mikhail 
gorbachev 
im not quite clear what the problems what the difficulties 
in the senate are we have not been told yet shevardnadze said 
after arriving at genevas cointrin airport 
another senator david boren dokla said soviet officials 
have turned us down flatly on some verification issues 
previously thought to have been settled he said there were about 
10 outstanding and unresolved verification issues 
senators had expressed hope that the problems could be resolved 
during the shultzshevardnadze meeting 
the senate has postponed debate on the treaty until the dispute 
is resolved the united states last month asked the soviets for an 
explanation and the soviets replied sunday night 
shevardnadze told reporters that the us side was asking 
certain questions certain points of clarification on the 
verification issue we answered those questions and we thought 
that there is no problem he said 
a us official in washington speaking on condition of 
anonymity said we dont consider the soviet response to our 
questions fully satisfactory theres more work to be done 
shevardnadze said that on other questions not dealing with inf 
verification we have brought new ideas he did not elaborate 
other items on the foreign ministers agenda are conventional 
weapons nuclear testing regional problems and bilateral and 
humanitarian issues shevardnadze said 
shevardnadze downplayed prospects for quick agreement on another 
arms control agreement called start that would cut strategic or 
intercontinental nuclear forces by up to 50 percent 
he said he did not think the two sides would be able to complete 
work on that agreement by the moscow summit may 29june 2 
but we will try to achieve substantial progress he added 
at their summit meeting last december reagan and gorbachev had 
instructed their negotiators to try to prepare a start treaty in 
time for signing at the moscow meeting 
shevardnadze said it was difficult to predict when a start 
agreement might be completed but a lot of work has been done and 
i think that we will be able to make some progress here in geneva 
and particularly during the moscow summit 
in moscow soviet media on tuesday reported that the us senate 
has indefinitely postponed ratification of the arms accord 
the government newspaper izvestia accused senate democrats of 
playing an electionyear political game 
although the soviet government is also going through a detailed 
ratification process final approval is a formality because the 
treaty signed by reagan and gorbachev has already been endorsed by 
the ruling 13man politburo

sporadic sniper fire crackled in the 
shiite moslem slums tuesday and rival militiamen fortified their 
positions apparently convinced that a truce arranged by the syrian 
army would not last 
families streamed out of the ramshackle 16 square miles of south 
beirut carrying mattresses bundles of clothing and other 
possessions about 250000 shiites lived in the slums before the 
battle began last friday but police said 60 percent had fled by 
tuesday 
the 18 foreign hostages in lebanon including nine americans 
are also thought to be held captive in the slums 
police reported five people wounded by sniper fire gone at 
least temporarily were the tank mortar and rocket duels between 
the shiite militias amal and hezbollah that killed at least 154 
people and wounded 372 in the previous four days 
before dawn 36 syrian officers moved into the area with six 
committees to man truce observation posts police said each 
committee included an iranian embassy official a representative of 
amal and another of hezbollah 
amal a mainstream militia backed by syria and the radical 
proiranian hezbollah are fighting for control of the slums amal 
is arabic for hope and hezbollah means party of god 
syria and iran allies in public are competing behind the 
scenes for influence with the 12 million shiites lebanons 
largest sect 
president hafez assad of syria keeps 25000 soldiers in lebanon 
including 7500 in beirut after 13 years of civil war he was the 
countrys undisputed power broker until iran began challenging the 
syrian position 
there still was no word tuesday on the fate of the hostages 
most of whom are believed held by kidnappers linked to hezbollah 
a police source said it was physically impossible for 
hostages to have been smuggled out because amal and the syrian army 
control the slum exits 
the syrians sent 7500 soldiers to moslem west beirut in 
february 1987 to stop a factional war in which the two main 
elements were amal and the druse militia led by walid jumblatt 
they drove hezbollah militiamen from some outposts in west 
beirut but have stayed out of the southern shiite slums 
syrias military intelligence chief in lebanon said tuesday 
however it is impermissible to let the current state of affairs 
continue 
when asked whether soldiers would be sent into the slums if the 
fighting did not stop brig gen ghazi kenaan said we hope it 
wont come to that but we shall not allow the bloodshed to 
continue 
a lebanese police spokesman whose name cannot be revealed 
because of regulations said the truce committees were trying to 
convince the warring factions to observe a ceasefire as a first 
step 
the threepoint truce plan announced monday calls for a 
ceasefire pulling militiamen off the streets and a return to 
positions held before the battle began 
hezbollah which has gained control of about half the slum area 
since friday rejects the return to prefriday positions the 
police spokesman said tuesday 
militiamen of hezbollah were seen fortifying their positions 
with earthworks in the densely populated districts ghobeiri bir 
elabed and hay madi 
amal controls the haret hreik mreiji roweiss shiyah and 
kasskass districts plus the main gateways into the slums 
according to the police spokesman amal moved in 1000 more 
fighters from the bekaa valley in east lebanon a main base for the 
syrian army the ancient city of baalbek in the bekaa is a 
hezbollah stronghold 
it appears that both sides are preparing for another round of 
fighting the police spokesman said 
how many combatants have been involved on both sides is unclear 
a police source said hezbollah could put about 5000 men in the 
field but amal is believed to be larger and has a broader 
following among the shiites 
ibrahim sarhan a vegetable vendor and his wife and four 
children walked out of the slums tuesday carrying mattresses and 
clothes 
we have been living in a basement since friday he said i 
think this is the beginning of a long battle we will come back 
when this is over 
mohammed milhem a 30yearold grocer was trying to patch a 
bullet hole in his cars gas tank 
we need the car to get out of here he said his wife and 
three daughters were packing the car with mattresses clothing a 
television set and a sewing machine 
some of those who flee have family or friends elsewhere in 
lebanon others camp out on the streets of west beirut or take 
refuge in schools mosques or sports stadiums

israeli troops roused 
palestinians at dawn tuesday and confiscated their identity papers 
in a new campaign to force 400000 arabs in the gaza strip to renew 
their government id cards 
arab underground leaders warned residents via leaflets and 
mosque loudspeakers that the id campaign in the gaza strip was a 
plot to break a fivemonth palestinian uprising 
maj gen yitzhak mordechai commander of israeli troops in 
gaza said the effort was designed to ferret out false id cards and 
catch security and tax offenders refusal to pay taxes and other 
fees has been a chief tactic of the struggle against israels 
21year occupation in the west bank and gaza strip 
some of the new cards actually banned palestinians from entering 
israel 
also tuesday israeli troops shot and wounded an arab youth in 
the stomach after an army jeep was stoned in the west bank village 
of ramin eight miles north of nablus the military command said 
the unidentified youth was in serious condition officials at 
nearby tulkarem hospital said the army said a soldier was slightly 
wounded 
the united nations said 185 arabs and two israelis have been 
killed since the violence in the occupied territories started dec 
8 the army said this week that more than 1400 palestinians have 
been injured along with 298 soldiers and 172 israeli settlers 
in the gaza strip on tuesday underground leaflets told arab 
residents to resist the israeli campaign to renew identity cards 
do not change your id cards the leaflets read this will 
harm the uprisings achievements and strength 
troops banged on doors at dawn to awake palestinians and demand 
their papers 
they banged on windows and doors and ordered us to hand over 
our identity cards they said we had to change them said sheik 
khalo a moslem religious leader from gaza city 
the army said about 2000 of the 8000 residents of gaza citys 
rimal area applied for new id cards 
hundreds of palestinians crowded into large dustcovered tents 
at two schools converted into makeshift registration centers many 
said the army forced them to come 
the orders affect palestinians between the ages 16 and 60 who 
have to pay 10 for new cards the army said it would take about 
three months to issue new ids to everyone 
arabs in the occupied lands must carry an identity card at all 
times and show the card at frequent security checks identity cards 
are vital for all transactions with the military government 
many of the hundreds of arabs standing in the sweltering heat 
for about four hours tuesday waiting for their pictures to be taken 
were angry because there was only one photographer 
it is ramadan a moslem holy month we are fasting said 
ahmed abu hassan 26 we are not animals to spend all day here 
waiting instead of changing our identity cards the israelis should 
change their minds about occupying our land 
the itim news agency said some new identity cards carried a 
message saying the bearer was barred from entering israel a 
military source confirmed there were special instructions on 
some cards but refused to elaborate 
an 18yearold palestinian who identified himself only as 
mohammed said he would not change his card 
on the new ids they will write all the previous times i was 
in prison he said if its written on the id that i was in 
prison i will get special treatment everytime i get stopped the 
soldiers will beat me 
the army also said tuesday it had cracked a guerrilla ring in 
the gaza strip that was planning to carry out a suicide bombing in 
tel avivs central bus station 
the group identified as belonging to yasser arafats fatah wing 
of the palestine liberation organization was also linked to four 
other attacks including laying a mine that injured four israeli 
troops in gaza last march and planting a bomb at an israeli school 
south of tel aviv in february an army spokesman said no one was 
hurt by the bomb 
a military representative speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the ring was broken last week 
meanwhile army chief of staff gen dan shomron said tuesday 
that israeli settlers were aggravating tension in the occupied 
territories 
he cited a clash with arabs at beita in the west bank last month 
in which an israeli teenager died 
in another development coretta scott king widow of martin 
luther king jr appealed to israeli leaders to release 
arabamerican activist mubarak awad from jail and cancel a 
deportation order against him

against israels occupation for inciting violence he was moved 
tuesday to ramle prison from the jerusalem jail where he had been 
held since thursday a police spokesman said

about 1000 people with aids will kill 
themselves by 1991 if current trends continue researchers said 
tuesday 
they based that figure on an estimate of 380 suicides per 
100000 diagnosed aids cases in a new york study 
peter marzuk of cornell university medical college in new york 
said the relatively high rate indicates that mental health 
professionals should help patients better deal with the stresses of 
the deadly disease he added they should aggressively treat 
psychiatric symptoms that may contribute to suicide risk 
he and his colleagues described the work at the american 
psychiatric associations annual meeting 
researchers reviewed medical examiner records for all new york 
city suicides in 1985 through 1987 
they found 42 suicides by people with acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome during that period of about 11000 city residents with 
the disease 
ages ranged from 22 to 58 with an average of 38 all were men 
fiftyseven percent were homosexuals or bisexuals and 12 percent 
intravenous drug users the rest had other risk factors for the 
disease or the factors were unknown marzuk said 
twothirds of the group killed themselves within six months of 
being told they had aids he said 
another period of high risk was in the later stages of the 
disease when euthanasia might play a role he said 
the effect of the aids virus on the central nervous system and 
psychological pressures of the disease appear to contribute to the 
suicide rate he said the virus may generate depression dementia 
psychosis or other conditions that could contribute to suicide 
risk he said and the diagnosis often forces the person to reveal 
homosexuality or illicit drug use to family and friends who may 
then abandon the person he said 
marzuk also said homosexuals and intravenous drug users are 
thought to have higherthannormal suicide rates even without aids 
the research updates results based on suicides in 1985 
the updated statistics appear to bear out the early data that 
men ages 20 to 59 with aids run 36 times the risk of suicide as 
comparable men without the disease marzuk said 
the early data also suggested an overall suicide risk of 66 
times the rates of other people of the same ages and gender 
those estimates are very close to what we suspect said 
steve morin of the american psychological associations task force 
on psychology and aids 
it will be important to compare the rates to those of homosexual 
men without the diagnosis to find the impact of the disease itself 
he said 
in other research described tuesday researchers said they found 
evidence that simply educating innercity youth about the risks of 
getting the virus through sexual contact fails to cut their risk 
a study of 102 residents of the newark nj area found no 
relationship between their degree of knowledge about sexual 
transmission of the virus and their amount of highrisk sexual 
behavior researchers said

yasser arafat on tuesday accused the united 
states of threatening to kill plo officials if palestinian 
guerrillas attack american targets 
the united states denied the accusation 
the state department said in washington that it had received 
reports the plo might target americans because of alleged us 
involvement in the assassination of khalil wazir the plos second 
in command 
wazir was slain april 16 during a raid on his house near tunis 
tunisia israeli officials who spoke on condition they not be 
identified said an israeli squad carried out the assassination 
there have been accusations by the plo that the united states 
knew about and approved plans for slaying wazir 
arafat the palestine liberation organization leader claimed 
the threat to kill plo officials was made in a us government 
document the plo obtained from an arab government he refused to 
identify the government 
in washington assistant secretary of state richard murphy 
denied arafats accusation that the united states threatened plo 
officials 
state department spokesman charles redman said the united states 
has been in touch with a number of middle eastern countries about 
possible plo attacks against american citizens and facilities 
he added that arafats interpretation of those contacts was 
entirely without foundation 
arafat spoke at a news conference in his heavily guarded villa 
in baghdad where extra security guards have been deployed he said 
security also was being augmented at plo offices around the arab 
world following the alleged threat 
he produced a photocopy of the alleged document it appeared to 
be part of a longer document with the word confidential stamped 
at the bottom 
the document which was typewritten in english referred to 
wazir by his code name abu jihad it read 
you may be aware of charges in several middle eastern and 
particulary palestinian circles that the us knew of and approved 
abu jihads assassination 
on april 18th a state department spokesman said that the 
united states condemns this act of political assassination had 
no knowledge of and was not involved in any way in this 
assassination 
it has come to our attention that the plo leader yasser arafat 
may have personally approved a series of terrorist attacks against 
american citizens and facilities abroad possibly in retaliation 
for last months assassination of abu jihad 
any possible targeting of american personnel and facilities in 
retaliation for abu jihads assassination would be totally 
reprehensible and unjustified we would hold the plo responsible 
for any such attacks 
arafat said the document reveals the us administration is 
planning in full cooperation with the israelis to conduct a 
crusade of terrorist attacks and then to blame the plo for them 
these attacks will then be used to justify the assassination 
of plo leaders 
he strongly denied that the plo planned any such attacks

the military shouldnt become deeply involved 
in fighting illegal drugs because soldiers arent properly trained 
to enforce civilian laws defense secretary frank c carlucci told 
congress on tuesday 
i do not believe law enforcement making arrests is 
appropriate for the military carlucci said i think it is 
unwise to get the military into the law enforcement question 
do we shoot people do we shoot down planes he said at a 
hearing of the senate appropriations defense subcommittee 
carlucci was trying to deal with a rising wave of sentiment in 
congress that the military should be used more heavily to block the 
flow of illegal drugs into the united states 
last week the house voted 38523 to order president reagan to 
have the military seal the us borders against drug traffickers 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said earlier this week that 
house leaders are drafting an antidrug bill that will increase the 
military role 
rep bill nichols dala asked the pentagon on tuesday to 
develop within 10 days a plan for using military resources to stop 
the crossborder drug flow 
nichols chairman of the house armed services investigations 
subcommittee made his request after a hearing at which a 
bipartisan group of lawmakers also chastised pentagon officials for 
their reluctance to increase military involvement in the war on 
drugs 
we recognize that this is a mission that you would enter into 
with some degree of concern nichols said its not the normal 
duties that have been assigned to the military but i have to 
ask myself if not the military then who were not getting the 
job done 
nichols said he wants the pentagons drug interdiction plan 
ready for subcommittee hearings later this month in miami and el 
paso texas 
the senate is expected to debate and vote on similar proposals 
this week as the chamber works on its version of a pentagon budget 
bill one of the senate amendments is being written by sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services committee 
military enforcement of civilian laws is banned by an 1878 law 
the posse comitatus act but congress amended the law six years ago 
to allow the pentagon to share some information with civilian law 
enforcement agencies 
since then carlucci noted military planes and ships routinely 
have given information to law enforcement officials including the 
drug enforcement administration coast guard personnel ride aboard 
navy ships in the caribbean sea to make drug arrests 
thousands and thousands of planes fly across our borders 
annually with drugs sen alfonse damato rny told carlucci 
either were going to have a war on drugs and get the military 
involved or were not 
sen ted stevens ralaska said were at war here and we 
think the people to be handling a war are in the department of 
defense 
carlucci answered that i agree that there is a war on but i 
believe it is a different kind of war than the military is involved 
in 
we can do a certain amount of this and we are doing the 
maximum carlucci said of current antidrug efforts 
the military are not trained for the law enforcement 
mission carlucci said to suddenly tell them youre in law 
enforcement you have to shift the entire focus the training 
theres a major difference between military and police work our 
people are not trained to read miranda rights they are trained to 
shoot to kill 
at the house hearing grant green assistant secretary of 
defense for force management and personnel said we need to look 
at what we as a country can realistically accomplish in drug 
interdiction we cant just say seal the borders in 30 days 
green said using the military to close us borders to drug 
traffickers would cost a minimum of 20 billion and harm pentagon 
readiness

wind storms and fire snarled air traffic at 
ohare international airport earlier this week and when a gunman 
threatened to shoot at airplanes tuesday authorities reached an 
inescapable conclusion 
it was a pretty bad week said mort edelstein spokesman for 
the federal aviation administration 
storms and a fire severing phone links between the faa control 
center and chicagos two airports disrupted air service around the 
midwest on sunday and into monday 
just as things were on their way back to normal tuesday the 
gunman struck 
from an apartment in a suburb near ohare one of the worlds 
busiest airports the gunman forced authorities to divert about 125 
departing flights from a runway that would have sent them over the 
building edelstein said 
the diversions resulted in delays of up to 20 minutes a flight 
edelstein added 
the gunman who surrendered after allegedly shooting a policeman 
in the foot was being held in dupage county jail 
by midday tuesday edelstein said things were returning to 
normal but the weather is very bad in atlanta and authorities 
were watching whether that would affect flights at ohare he said 
a week of troubles began on what had been a balmy mothers day 
as storms swirled into the chicago area on wind gusting up to 80 
mph a tornado touched down about 40 miles southwest of chicago 
while the storm raged firefighters battled a fire that swept 
through an illinois bell telephone switching station in suburban 
hinsdale that cut off telephone service for thousands of customers 
and severed the phone link between the faas control center in 
aurora and air traffic control computers at ohare and chicagos 
other major airport midway 
without the computer links controllers had to use backup phone 
lines to get air traffic information manually edelstein said 
nearly half the lines from aurora to ohare were restored or 
rerouted tuesday edelstein said adding authorities expected all 
the circuits to be working by wednesday 
the combination of weather and disrupted phone service caused 
delays and flight cancellations 
we had delays as long as two hours at its height sunday night 
and early monday morning said joe hopkins spokesman for 
chicagobased united airlines 
the airline canceled about 40 of 800 flights in and out of 
ohare on sunday he said 
alexandra boettcher 25 of chicago tried to leave detroits 
metropolitan airport on sunday for midway but gave up when her 
southwest airlines flight was delayed 
she returned monday to face more delays 
at one point they said there were 17 planes waiting on the 
runway plus i was number 17 on a standby list she said 
she and three other people she met at the airport rented a car 
and drove the nearly 300 miles back to chicago 
hopefully we beat the plane back she said we dont 
know

president francois mitterrand named socialist 
michel rocard as premier tuesday to form a new government following 
mitterrands decisive victory in the presidential election 
premier jacques chirac resigned and mitterrand swiftly picked 
rochard a popular politician who describes himself as a 
freeenterprise leftist 
mitterrand also a socialist defeated the conservative chirac 
in sundays presidential election chirac had been premier since 
his conservative alliance defeated the socialists in 1986 for 
control of parliament 
rocard who has centrist support went to his new offices in the 
hotel matignon on the left bank early in the evening for the 
transfer of power 
afterward rocard told reporters the president has given me a 
tough job he said he would form a cabinet bearing in mind the 
french peoples worries for their future for their jobs for 
their education for their security 
under the french constitution the president is responsible for 
foreign affairs defense and guarding the nations interests 
abroad while the premier runs daytoday government 
after meeting with rocard chirac left for the paris city hall 
where he maintains an apartment he has been mayor since 1977 
under the french system voters choose a president and a 
parliament in separate elections the premier is chosen by the 
party or parties that wins control of the parliament 
rocard was appointed tuesday because chirac resigned 
because his party does not control parliament rocard must form 
a government with support from outside the socialist ranks 
mitterrand who is beginning his second sevenyear term as 
president has said nonsocialists would be included in the cabinet 
the change of government formally ends cohabitation as the 
french call the uneasy sharing of power by a president and premier 
of opposing political views 
it also marked the first time in 30 years of the fifth republic 
that a government does not have a majority in the national 
assembly which is controlled by centerright parties that backed 
chirac 
rocard 57 is a rival of mitterrand in the socialist party and 
was prepared to seek the presidency this year until mitterrand 
declared his candidacy 
as a nondoctrinaire socialist however the former agriculture 
minister symbolizes the presidents effort to appeal to a broader 
segment of the public 
mitterrand 71 profited from a divided right and won 56 percent 
of the vote in sundays election 
presenting himself as unifier of the nation he won over some 
centrist politicians who were upset with chiracs attempts to 
accommodate the far right 
all but renouncing his socialist past the president has 
promised a policy of enlargement that is broad enough to 
satisfy centrists previously aligned with the right but does not 
alienate the left 
jacques barrot secretarygeneral of the social democratic 
center one of the parties in the centerright coalition that 
backed chirac said tuesday that rocards performance would be 
judged without preconceptions 
for us centrists frances situation and the challenges it 
must meet demands that no chance for dialogue be overlooked he 
said one must recognize his rocards merit in certain 
situations and his courage when he tried to pull the left out of 
its dogmatisms and its wellbeaten paths 
newspaper commentators and political observers had predicted 
mitterrands choice for premier would be rocard a debonair man 
long one of frances favorite politicians 
he also is known for independent and outspoken views he 
resigned as agriculture minister in 1985 because he opposed a 
system of proportional voting instituted by the socialists 
mitterrand the first french president elected twice by 
universal suffrage has said he will not dissolve the national 
assembly for new elections immediately but will try to work with 
it his party holds 211 of the 577 seats 
some supporters urge that the president call elections quickly 
to take advantage of the momentum gained in sundays vote 
former president valery giscard destaing a major figure in the 
centerright union for french democracy has called for a 
constructive opposition mitterrand won the office from him in 
a close election seven years ago 
a former socialist premier laurent fabius said i dont think 
the french want a return to 1981 referring to the socialist 
government that assumed power that year 
they are for an enlargement he said in a radio interview 
excellent things were done in 1981 but time has passed and 
society has changed 
the left is no longer an experiment this is a change with 
incredible historic dimensions

the united states asked singapore on tuesday 
to remove the political officer from its embassy in retaliation for 
similar action the east asian nation took last week against an 
american diplomat 
state department spokesman charles e redman said singapore was 
requested to withdraw robert hh chua first secretary at the 
embassy redman expressed hope that we can put this unfortunate 
episode behind us 
the titfortat withdrawals started last week when singapore 
insisted that e mason hendrickson an american embassy officer be 
removed on grounds he had interfered in the domestic affairs of the 
country 
singapore had charged that hendrickson met with lawyers opposed 
to the government of prime minister lee kuan yew to urge them to 
run for election and to suggest that financing would be available 
redman said the allegations were totally without foundation 
but that the united states was compelled to withdraw hendrickson in 
keeping with international law that gives nations the right to 
decide who may be accredited as diplomats 
the united states values highly its ties with singapore which 
we have regarded as among our strongest friends in east asia 
redman said we are therefore both shocked and puzzled at the 
allegations which have been made against us and which as i have 
noted we reject in toto 
the state department made no charges against chua whose 
position in the singapore embassy was roughly comparable to the 
post held in singapore by hendrickson 
under the diplomatic concept of reciprocity nations that 
feel their diplomats have been treated unfairly often respond by 
taking parallel action

gov bob martinez on tuesday signed a 
law prohibiting people from drinking alcoholic beverages while 
traveling in most vehicles 
certainly this is a quantum jump in making the highways 
safer martinez said 
the law takes effect oct 1 drivers caught thereafter with open 
containers of alcohol will be subject to 52 fines and having 
points assessed on their licenses passengers would be subject to 
32 fines 
drivers or passengers could be cited if the open container were 
found anywhere within their reach an opened container of alcohol 
would be legal if kept lock a separate compartment or the trunk 
backers of the law have for years expressed outrage that florida 
law let drivers and passengers drink alcoholic beverages while 
driving even though the state has tough laws against drunken 
driving 
it was just a combination of the pressure back home and the 
carnage on the highways said sen don childers who sponsored 
the senate version of the bill its ludicrous for us to have 
tough dui laws on our statute books and yet still allow someone to 
drink and drive in this state 
however exempt from the new law will be passengers in a hired 
vehicle such as a bus or limousine or in a recreational vehicle 
longer than 21 feet 
sometimes in getting a law passed certain stipulations are 
inserted noted martinez i think this is something that is 
going to require monitoring if motor homes all of a sudden end 
up with a higher accident rate i think this is something that will 
have to be revisited

members of hungarys increasingly 
divided communist party met tuesday to discuss reforms that may 
affect toplevel officials as pressure mounted for the partys 
leader to resign 
the partys central committee cited personnel changes as one 
of two items on the agenda of a may 20 session of the communist 
party according to a communique issued at the end of the oneday 
session 
the meeting focused on a draft document on political and 
economic changes authored by party leader janos kadar according to 
the official news agency mti 
kadar who turns 76 on may 26 has been blamed by party 
loyalists and dissidents alike for hungarys economic crisis and 
his apparent reluctance to endorse sweeping political reform 
premier karoly grosz a leading contender for kadars position 
has said the political future of the party boss may be up for 
debate at a national party conference may 2022 
kadar has led the party since moscow quashed an antisoviet 
uprising in 1956 he has said he would step down if asked but has 
given little indication he intends to relinquish control soon 
tuesdays meeting was to elect a special committee that will 
deal with personnel matters at the conference grosz told reporters 
while on a visit to britain last week 
in the event that some 1000 delegates attending the 
conference decide that personnel changes are necessary and if 
these changes include the person of janos kadar he will accept the 
decision grosz said on friday according to mti 
last month four outspoken advocates of political reform and 
dialogue with nonparty activists were abruptly expelled from the 
communist ranks 
that move was seen as a sign that kadar and his followers who 
are reportedly locked in a debate over who should retire first 
still wield clout among the nations 880000 communists 
however pressure is growing for kadars resignation with 
younger party officials anxious to assume power and citizens 
complaining about government austerity measures 
with a foreign debt of more than 17 billion this nation of 
106 million people has eastern europes highest per capita debt 
inflation is running at more than 15 percent and is likely to 
go higher following a decision april 1 to liberalize state controls 
on 80 percent of hungarys retail prices 
the draft paper for the may 20 conference goes far in dealing 
with these complaints in it the communist party formally accepts 
blame for the current economic hardships and considers granting 
limited political reforms such as secret ballots and limited terms 
in party office 
but some critics of the paper have demanded that party members 
stick rigidly to communist policy in public statements 
the demand is seen as an attack on leading reformist imre 
pozsgay a member of the central committee and the communist 
establishments foremost proponent of reform 
pozsgay has said he found support in moscow for his ideas and 
wants to see the government initiate referendums for change as 
well as guarantee independence in hungarian for special interest 
groups 
the arguments of reformists like pozsgay have been bolstered in 
recent months by the growing number of economists who are 
advocating market reforms as the only way out of hungarys growing 
economic crisis

a courtappointed official found maria desillers 
misspent up to 200000 collected for her sons unsuccessful liver 
transplants but she angrily denied the charges tuesday calling 
them crazy 
ms desillers 7yearold son ronnie died at childrens 
hospital in pittsburgh last year after a highly publicized 
fundraising drive that included a 1000 donation from president 
reagan 
karen geivers appointed at the request of the dade state 
attorneys office to review ms desillers spending cited a series 
of questionable expenses paid from the donations 
among the payments were 10850 to a jewelry store 23700 to 
ms desillers exboyfriend and 96527 in cash withdrawals for 
personal expenses 
at an appeal tuesday before a state administrative examiner over 
a 1000 state fine levied on ms desillers timothy jansen of the 
florida secretary of states office accused her of misleading the 
public 
i dont think that the people who donated money intended that 
the money for ronnie should go for cars the rent jewelry and 
certain other expenditures jansen told hearing examiner donald 
alexander we cannot allow people to raise money for one purpose 
and go against that purpose for personal benefit 
alexander will take the testimony and documents under 
consideration and make a decision on the fine within 30 days said 
ms desillers attorney harry robbins 
after the hearing ms desillers lashed out at the report 
im not saying im perfect she said but how could 
she say on there that i know the law and i disregarded it its 
crazy 
the report by ms geivers acknowledged that ms desillers had 
suffered a great personal tragedy with her sons death 
but it added she appears to have ignored the laws when it 
suited her purposes to do so 
ms desillers has said the questionable expenditures were 
necessary to raise money for an organ donation awareness program 
she said some of the money went to help her keep up a 
professional appearance while soliciting funds as president of 
the nowdormant ronnie desillers national foundation 
and she said the jewelry expense was to buy back items she had 
pawned to pay ronnies medical expenses and payments to her brother 
and boyfriend jose castillo were to repay loans 
jose spent more than twice that helping ronnie and i she 
said he lost two businesses when he came to pittsburgh

the soviet unions 1988 harvests could produce 
215 million metric tons of grain up 2 percent from last years 
bumper output of 2114 million tons the agriculture department 
said tuesday 
in its first forecast of this years soviet grain production 
the usda said the harvests could include 92 million tons of wheat 
109 million tons of coarse grains such as rye barley oats and 
corn and 14 million tons of miscellaneous grains and pulses which 
include peas and beans 
the report said the harvest outlook could mean a cutback in 
grain imports particularly wheat the united states has been 
selling the soviets huge quantities of wheat lately all of it at 
subsidized prices under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep 
if the 1988 harvest turns out as forecast it would be the third 
straight year that soviet grain production has exceeded 200 million 
tons an unprecedented feat in that country 
it also would be the thirdlargest soviet grain output exceeded 
by the record crop of 2374 million tons in 1978 and the 1976 
harvest of 2238 million tons 
officials said the 1988 forecast is highly tentative and 
that it will be modified as the season progresses by both 
positive and negative factors including weather developments 
total grain area was estimated at 116 million hectares slightly 
more than last years 1152 million hectares 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or 394 bushels of corn one hectare is equal to about 
247 acres 
the improved outlook for the 1988 ussr grain crop 
particularly wheat is expected to reduce total grain import needs 
in 198889 the report said this years coarse grain crop is 
projected at 109 million tons somewhat below last years large 
harvest 
therefore it said total soviet wheat imports could decline to 
15 million tons in the international marketing year that begins on 
july 1 from 22 million tons in 198788 that would be the lowest 
level in nine years 
but imports of coarse grain at a forecast of 10 million tons in 
198889 would be about the same as the last two years 
total grain imports including wheat coarse grains and 
miscellaneous grains could fall to 26 million tons in 198889 from 
325 million tons this season 
analysts said much will depend on the quality of the soviets 
1988 wheat harvest and how competively priced lowerquality feed 
wheat is relative to other grains used for livestock feed 
in 1986 when the soviet union last harvested 92 million tons of 
wheat the 1987 crop was 833 million tons it included much 
lowquality grain which prompted large imports of higher quality 
us wheat 
a similar problem with poor quality in the 1987 harvest 
triggered further imports of higher quality us wheat all of it 
sold at subsidized prices under eep arrangements 
moreover the united states and the soviet union are still 
negotiating a longterm grain agreement to replace the current 
fiveyear pact that expires on sept 30 the agreement would 
continue the practice of specifying minimum amounts of us wheat 
and corn to be bought by the soviets each year

richard s caliguiri was eulogized tuesday as 
a renaissance man whose love affair with pittsburgh made him one of 
the citys most popular mayors 
the media has reminded us frequently that dick caliguiri was 
slight of build and stature but when the history of this city is 
written mayor caliguiris chapters deserve to be titled the 
years of the giant bishop anthony g bosco told about 1800 
mourners at st paul cathedral 
i cannot remember another pittsburgher whose death has 
provoked such an outpouring of praise and grief from republicans 
and democrats from old and young from black and white from rich 
and poor from captains of industry and from street people all are 
in mourning 
caliguiri died friday from what his doctors said was an 
accumulation of protein caused by the rare disease amyloidosis he 
was 56 and in his 12th year as mayor 
with the slight but commanding figure of dick at the wheel we 
felt safe bosco said because he was a strong leader and a 
visionary we have seen his beloved city grow into a proud 
metropolis its skyline is bold and proud and dick caliguiri was 
the genius the driving force the architect the builder he was 
truly the renaissance man 
his vision encompassed more than steel and stones said

consumer interests lost the opening skirmish 
tuesday in house committee action on a politically sensitive bill 
that they fear will make it harder for victims injured by unsafe 
products to recover damages from manufacturers 
the house energy and commerce committee taking the first votes 
on the product liability bill after months of internal wrangling 
decisively defeated two consumerbacked amendments offered by rep 
henry a waxman dcalif and then adjourned until thursday 
the bill would provide a uniform federal standard of product 
liability sought by the business community to preempt conflicting 
state laws consumer activists vigorously oppose the measure on the 
ground that it would jeopardize the legal rights of victims of 
hazardous consumer products 
much of the first day of committee debate focused on complex 
legal questions raised by what rep james j florio dnj called 
a complex and extremely controversial bill its chances of 
passage in an election year are considered highly unlikely 
a similar bill died in the senate in late 1986 after a 
filibuster led by ernest f hollings dsc the senate commerce 
committee chairman who remains a staunch foe of any such 
legislation 
at the request of rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
house panel rep mike synar dokla drafted a plan aimed at 
making a compromise bill approved by florios subcommittee last 
december more palatable to consumer groups and moderate committee 
democrats 
but synars amendments drew sniping from all sides tuesday 
prompting rep michael bilirakis rfla to predict a flood of 
proposed changes that might include some venomous snakes 
further threatening the bills prospects 
this is a watereddown bill but it is better than none 
said rep norman lent of new york the committees ranking 
republican 
waxman charging that we are about to emasculate the product 
liability system proposed to expand the bills narrow list of 
federal legal grounds for damage suits by consumers against 
manufacturers of defective products 
waxmans two proposed amendments to the synar plan were rejected 
on roll call votes of 2912 and 3012 with dingell voting both 
times with opponents 
under the subcommittee bill originally introduced by rep bill 
richardson dnm a manufacturer could escape liability for 
damages if he did not know or could not know of a design defect 
with knowledge reasonably available to him or if there were no 
feasible alternative design 
this restriction on liability would not apply if the consumer 
could establish that the product was egregiously unsafe that an 
ordinary consumer would not know of the products risks and if the 
product had little or no usefulness 
the synar plan would require only that the plaintiff prove that 
the product was so unsafe compared with its usefulness that it 
should not have been marketed synar also would put the burden of 
proof on the manufacturer to show that a design defect could not be 
discovered and that an alternative design was not feasible 
leaders of four consumer organizations wrote dingell on april 27 
to complain that the synar plan still falls far short of 
protecting the legal rights of individuals injured by unreasonably 
dangerous and defective products 
they said synars amendments would weaken the legal doctrine of 
strict liability used by most states that doctrine shifts the 
focus of a liability trial from the manufacturers alleged 
misconduct to the product itself relieving the courts of proving 
what a manufacturer knew or should have known about its product 
in a separate may 2 letter to each committee member the 
consumer groups said the bill would make it more difficult and 
in some cases impossible for victims of defective products to 
recover their losses from those responsible for such defects and 
would reduce manufacturers incentives to produce safer products

president reagan said tuesday he has not ruled 
out pardoning former aides oliver l north and john m poindexter 
for any crimes in the irancontra affair but he indicated he would 
not do it before a verdict in their trials 
reagan responded with an emphatic no when asked by a 
reporter whether he had ruled out granting pardons to north and 
poindexter 
he did not elaborate simply turning and walking from the white 
houses roosevelt room where he had presented the presidential 
medal of freedom to britains lord carrington for his work as nato 
secretary general 
reagans comment came one day after he told an interviewer that 
it would be wrong to grant any pardons before the trial is over 
and suggested he would be out of office when that happens 
previously the president has hinted he is leaning toward a 
pardon for north and poindexter saying he did not think they were 
guilty of any crime and that he doubted any jury would convict them 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater went to the oval office 
to consult with reagan about his remark tuesday afterward 
fitzwater said the president had understood the question and gave 
the answer he wanted 
it means theres been no decision on pardons fitzwater 
said i wouldnt assume that any definitive judgment has been 
made 
fitzwater made public reagans response when syndicated 
columnist carl rowan asked him in an interview monday whether he 
would pardon north and poindexter 
you cant consider that carl until this case has been 
closed whichever way its going to go the president said to 
pardon somebody before trial leaves a sense of guilt around them a 
cloud of guilt for the rest of time and so this is something that 
i dont have to face 
the timing of the irancontra trial is uncertain us district 
judge gerhard a gesell has said he would like to start as early as 
june though lawyers for north and poindexter have said they would 
like to delay it until next year 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh has proposed starting the 
trial in september reagans term ends next jan 20 
poindexter who was reagans national security adviser and 
north a former national security council staff member have been 
charged along with arms dealers richard v secord and albert hakim 
with conspiring to illegally divert profits from the usiran arms 
sales to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
gesell on tuesday ordered that hakim and secord be allowed to 
examine thousands of pages of especially sensitive government 
documents that may be relevant to their defense 
government security officials had refused to allow either 
defendant to inspect the sensitive material hakim an iranianborn 
us citizen has never had a security clearance secord a retired 
air force major general has not been cleared for access to 
classified information since he left the government several years 
ago 
but the judge ruled that no basis exists for depriving either 
of these defendants of their right to determine the relevance and 
materiality of classified materials involved in this case 
lawyers for secord and hakim however waived their clients 
right to inspect between 35 and 70 sensitive documents to verify 
prosecution claims the material is irrelevant to the case

saudi arabia has refused to allow the united 
states to inspect the missiles the saudis bought secretly from 
china in 1986 assistant secretary of state richard murphy said 
tuesday 
but murphy also said the united states was completely 
satisfied with assurances given by china and the saudis that the 
missiles would not be equipped with nuclear or chemical warheads 
he told a congressional hearing the assurances were made both 
orally and in a letter from saudi king fahd to president reagan 
despite those assurances the united states still would like to 
inspect the missile sites and was continuing to discuss that 
possibility with the saudis murphy said but another us 
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity said he was 
doubtful the saudis would change their minds 
defense analysts argue that the conventional missiles could be 
converted easily for use as nuclear or chemical arms but murphy 
told the hearing that by agreeing last month to sign the 
international nuclear nonproliferation treaty saudi arabia was 
precluding the missiles conversion to nuclear weapons 
murphy conceded in response to questioning that us 
intelligence agencies had failed to detect the 1986 deal for the 
sale of the css2 intermediaterange missiles which have a range of 
up to 1800 miles 
we had no firm fix on it until january 1988 and nothing 
definite until march he told a joint hearing of the house 
foreign affairs subcommittee on europe and the middle east and the 
subcommittee on arms control international security and science 
the chinese missiles being deployed in the saudi desert are not 
accurate weapons and in our view they also do not improve the 
security of saudi arabia but the saudis feel differently 
particularly in view of the threat from iran murphy said 
saudi arabia and iran have been at odds for several years and 
the tensions culminated last month in the saudi decision to cut off 
diplomatic ties with tehran 
murphy was testifying on behalf of the administrations proposal 
to sell the saudis a 325 million package of maintenance and 
training for usmade awacs radar surveillance planes the five 
planes were supplied to the saudis last year under a 1981 contract 
murphy also was lobbying for the sale of 200 bradley fighting 
vehicles equipped with antitank tow missiles worth 500 million 
murphy said saudi arabia had warned the united states that if 
congress rejects the sale the saudis will go elsewhere he 
noted that when congress turned down the sale of f15 fighter jets 
to saudi arabia in 1985 the saudis signed a 12 billion contract 
with britain for tornado fighters 
we lost business and influence murphy said 
he said saudi arabia uses the ussupplied awacs for aerial 
patrols to protect american naval forces against iranian attacks in 
the persian gulf the saudis also allow the united states access to 
their ports and air bases and provide f15 fighter jet protection 
for us awacs flights over the northern part of the gulf he said 
the two sales before congress are clearly in the interest of 
the united states he said 
more than 180 members of the house and 58 senators have asked 
secretary of state george p shultz to block the saudi sales 
pending clarifications of the chinese missile purchase

an organization representing the nations home 
builders said tuesday it expected 15 million new homes to be 
started this year down from 1987 but still a reasonably good 
showing 
dale stuard president of the national association of home 
builders said single family homes would account for 11 million 
starts in 1988 with multifamily homes accounting for about 400000 
starts 
stuard said the forecast represented a reasonably good year 
the 1988 projection was a decrease from 1987 which had 1621000 
starts 
stuard said the industry did not foresee a recession this year 
but continued to be concerned about rising interest rates 
inflation and the impact of the 1986 tax law which he said had hit 
the housing industry particularly hard 
the organization which has 160000 members plans to lobby on 
capitol hill this week for its legislative agenda

farmers soon will be harvesting a winter wheat 
crop estimated at 162 billion bushels up 4 percent from last 
years production the agriculture department said tuesday 
the first forecast of the season based on surveys may 1 
compared with a 1987 winter wheat output of 156 billion bushels 
the average yield was estimated at 407 bushels per harvested acre 
up from last years 398 bushels per acre 
farmers are expected to have about 398 million acres for 
harvest this year up 1 percent from 393 million in 1987 the 
report said 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following 
summer it makes up about threefourths of total us wheat 
production 
no 1988 production estimates for spring wheat corn and other 
major springplanted crops were included those will be issued by 
usda later in the growing season 
the outlook for wheat prices at the farm also has brightened 
reflecting brisk export demand and a reduction in onceawesome us 
wheat stockpiles 
in a related supplyanddemand report usda projected total 
wheat production this year based on historical trends at 217 
billion bushels up slightly from 21 billion bushels in 1987 that 
would include winter wheat and other kinds planted this spring for 
harvest in 1988 
the report also projected the us wheat stockpile to decline 
further to around 796 million bushels by the end of the coming 
marketing year on may 31 1989 compared with more than 123 
billion bushels of oldcrop wheat expected to be carried over this 
june 1 
carl schwensen executive vice president of the national 
asssociation of wheat growers said the expected reduction in us 
wheat inventories will mean tighter supplies in the year ahead 
does that mean the united states is running low on wheat after 
the recent years of huge surpluses 
thats relatively correct schwensen said and if were 
going to stay in the world export market were going to have to 
have adequate supplies for our customers thats why we feel the 
acreage reserve level can be relaxed and farmers can have the 
opportunity to market more bushels in the 1989 season 
schwensen referred to a farm law provision that limits usda to 
no more than a 20 percent landidling requirement when the wheat 
stockpile is projected to drop below a billion bushels at a 
projected 796 million bushels on may 31 1989 that would be well 
below the mark 
for the last two years usda has required wheat farmers to idle 
275 percent of their base acreage in order to qualify for supports 
and other federal benefits schwensen said the association wants to 
see the 1989 requirement reduced to between 10 percent and 20 
percent 
wheat market prices were projected for 198889 at an average 
range of 280 to 320 per bushel compared with 255 estimated 
for 198788 
the indicated production of winter wheat based on may 1 
prospects are listed here the first numbers show the total 
production in thousands of bushels the second numbers are the 
average yields per acre for the major states

frontrunning democrat michael s dukakis said 
tuesday he will begin using secret service protection after relying 
for more than a year on local police on the presidential campaign 
trail 
the massachusetts governor said there have been no incidents or 
threats that prompted the change however he said there comes a 
point in all of this when secret service protection is necessary 
and in my judgment ive arrived at that point 
campaign aides said the timing was the result of several 
considerations including dukakis increasing prominence near the 
end of what has become a twoman democratic race with jesse jackson 
in addition aides said there was some concern inside the 
campaign about the potential for violence in california 
particularly in light of recent publicity marking 20 years since 
the assassination of robert f kennedy after his victory in the 
1968 california democratic primary 
the protection provided round the clock at taxpayer expense is 
to begin wednesday when dukakis leaves for a campaign trip through 
new jersey and washington dc en route to california 
the governor told reporters at a statehouse briefing that he met 
recently with secret service agents to review procedures 
they understand my lifestyle and the fact that we dont have 
governors mansions in this state dukakis said stressing his 
concern for his and his familys privacy 
asked if reporters would continue to enjoy access to the 
candidate dukakis said i certainly hope so i dont know 
why it should change 
kitty and i have been very very lucky for 25 years weve 
been deeply involved in public life and weve been able to do it 
with a remarkably normal personal and family life he said 
dukakis promised to continue riding the trolley to work from his 
home in suburban brookline 
jackson has had secret service protection for months and vice 
president george bush the apparent republican nominee has been 
protected throughout his term

the pentagon notified congress on tuesday that 
it had approved the sale of three p3c orion maritime surveillance 
planes to pakistan 
assuming there are no congressional objections the pentagon 
said pakistan would be allowed to purchase the three aircraft along 
with spare parts ground support facilities and training services 
for an estimated 240 million 
the orion is a propellerdriven plane used by the us navy for 
longrange sea patrols and the detection of submarines 
the announced sale of three of the planes comes just two months 
after neighboring india pakistans arch foe leased a 
nuclearpowered attack submarine from the soviet union 
according to pentagon sources india already had eight 
sovietmade foxtrot diesel submarines which date to the 1960s two 
newer russian kilo diesel subs and two advanced west germany 
diesel submarines known as hdw type 209s 
the pentagon insisted in a statement that the sale of the p3s 
to pakistan will not affect the basic military balance in the 
region but it added this purchase will permit pakistan to 
enhance its surveillance and antisubmarine and antisurface 
warfare capabilities 
the pentagon said the prime contractors would be the lockheed 
aeronautical systems co in burbank calif and the general motors 
corps detroit dieselallison gas turbine division in 
indianapolis ind 
beyond seeking maritime patrol aircraft pakistan also has been 
pressing the united states for e3 awacs earlywarning radar 
planes the united states has countered by suggesting that the 
pakistanis consider the smaller and less expensive e2c hawkeye 
flown by the navy 
pakistan became interested in an earlywarning radar plane 
because of repeated incursions by soviet aircraft into its airspace 
near neighboring afghanistan

a fivemember soviet delegation arrived 
tuesday to open talks that could produce a cultural agreement for 
signing at the moscow summit us officials said 
the agreement formally called a program document would go 
into effect at the end of the year replacing an accord signed 
after the first summit meeting between president reagan and kremlin 
leader mikhail s gorbachev in geneva in november 1985 
charles z wick head of the us information agency was to 
deliver the opening remarks at the start of the talks on thursday 
said agency spokesman jan hemming the soviet delegation was to 
remain in washington for a week 
soviet officials have said they expect the agreement which sets 
out the specifics of cultural and educational exchanges to be 
ready for the summit 
us and soviet officials have said there is little prospect for 
an arms control agreement during the summit which will mark 
reagans first visit to the land he once called an evil empire 
us officials were cautious about prospects for a cultural 
agreement 
lets not get our hopes up too high said joe oconnell a 
spokesman for usia the main american agency involved in the talks 
we would like to see progress in improving relations with the 
soviet union but there is no guarantee that a signing of this 
document will take place in moscow said oconnell what is 
important is that by dec 31 we have agreed on a solid document 
which will advance exchanges between the two countries 
the soviet delegation was headed by alexei glukhov the first 
deputy chief of the foreign mininstry department for humanitarian 
and cultural relations said oconnell 
cultural and educational exchanges between the superpowers 
slowed to a trickle after the united states in response to the 
soviet invasion of afghanistan allowed an earlier pact to lapse in 
1980 
the exchanges resumed in earnest after the geneva summit as 
us and soviet relations improved and soviet society began to open 
up under gorbachevs reforms gorbachev has since announced his 
intention to withdraw soviet troops from afghanistan 
in geneva the two leaders agreed in principle to sign a 
cultural exchange agreement lasting six years and their aides 
worked out a threeyear program document that expires at the end of 
the year the envisioned program document would last the additional 
three years spelled out in geneva oconnell said

congressional auditors said tuesday more than 
104000 retired government workers are paying the price for a 1977 
law that curbed social security spouses benefits for civil 
servants 
most of those retirees have lost all of their social security 
benefits according to a report by the general accounting office 
it said social securitys master beneficiary record for last 
january showed that threequarters of those affected were men 
congress adopted the measure to eliminate what lawmakers 
regarded as a windfall for civil servants who were not covered 
themselves by social security but who wound up receiving benefits 
through their spouses 
the gao said 104608 workers had their benefits reduced as a 
result of the audit the agency said 71 percent of the federal 
workers checked were drawing an average yearly pension of 16944 
most had their social security benefits eliminated entirely 
costing those workers an average of 178 a month or 2136 a year 
the law reduces the social security spousal or survivors 
benefits of a government retiree by 2 for every 3 of public 
pension it applies only to government workers not covered on their 
own jobs by social security most civil servants including all 
federal workers hired since 1984 are covered by social security 
for most families social security pays spouses benefits to 
elderly husbands or wives regardless of whether they contributed to 
the system an elderly spouse can draw a benefit half as large as 
the working spouses if she survives him she receives the larger 
of the two benefits

the government should require more extensive 
inspections and structural testing of older commercial jetliners to 
help deal with the black hole of aviation safety rep dan 
glickman dkan said tuesday 
it is a matter of extreme danger to the flying public and 
something that needs to be addressed now said glickman a member 
and former chairman of the science space and technology 
subcommittee on aviation 
at a news conference glickman said current inspection 
requirements by the federal aviation administration were 
inadequate he said he plans to introduce legislation soon to force 
the agency to expand its efforts 
glickman said his criticisms were prompted by the recent 
accident in hawaii involving an aloha airlines boeing 737 which 
lost part of its upper fuselage at 24000 feet federal 
investigators have found evidence of cracks caused by metal fatigue 
on the remaining fuselage 
he expressed concern that more accidents could occur with older 
planes 
i fear that were going to see in the next year a whole slew 
of these kinds of problems occur said glickman these can be 
prevented but right now barring some form of aggressive faa role in 
older planes i fear some catastrophes occurring in american 
aviation 
fred farrar an faa spokesman took issue with glickmans 
remarks about safety he also said the agency had started an extra 
inspection program for older planes 
we believe that when inspections are done both the regular 
inspections and supplemental inspections and any necessary 
corrections are made the aircraft are safe said farrar 
underlying glickmans concern is the question of how long a 
jetliner can safely remain in operation in particular the 
congressman said he was concerned that many older planes were being 
used far more intensively than manufacturers originally envisioned 
subjecting them to greater stress from repeated landings takeoffs 
and pressurizations 
last week the kansas lawmaker sent a letter to faa 
administrator t allan mcartor urging a program of regular 
structural inspections for all older jetliners 
at the news conference glickman criticized the faa for not 
conducting more research to determine the structural and 
technological lifespans of airliners he said the government agency 
should have a regular program of destructive testing in which 
it purchases older planes and tears them down to determine the 
effects of normal wear and tear 
glickman said he would propose legislation to require the faa 
along with nasa to develop stateoftheart inspection techniques 
currently visual and xray inspections are used for older planes 
there is an old saying that goes what you dont know cant 
hurt you in the case of old aircraft flying around our skies 
what you dont know can kill you said glickman

more than 2500 security troops 
surrounding the golden temple complex were ordered tuesday to shoot 
anyone trying to leave police said 
officers said the order was given after more than 800 people at 
least half of them women and children were evacuated from the 
shrine during a lull in fighting between the troops and armed sikh 
extremists holed up in the complex 
members of the paramilitary central reserve police force 
carrying automatic rifles and light machine guns encircled the 
400yearold golden temple some were posted on rooftops others 
were concealed behind barricades 
the two sides resumed intermittent fire for about two hours 
after the evacuation after 1 pm no return fire was heard from 
the militants security forces kept up occasional fire until 
sundown usually whenever a sikh appeared briefly over the walls of 
the sprawling compound 
seven indian reporters and photographers who spent most of 
monday trapped inside the complex emerged late monday night and 
said at least 100 militants with automatic rifles were inside 
one casualty was reported tuesday dilbagh singh a 31yearold 
sikh who was among the evacuees was shot in the leg he told a 
reporter he was wounded while walking toward the temples inner 
sanctum with two sikh militants 
the entire city of amritsar with a population of about 800000 
was under curfew monday and tuesday residents were told to stay 
indoors 
there was no word whether police planned to storm the temple 
the siege began monday after an exchange of fire between sikhs 
inside the temple and security troops killed at least five people 
and wounded 10 the golden temple is the main stronghold of sikhs 
demanding an independent homeland or greater autonomy for punjab 
state which includes amritsar 
although a majority in punjab sikhs comprise only 2 percent of 
indias total population of 800 million the sikhs claim they are 
discriminated against by hindus who make up 82 percent of the 
nationwide population 
most of the evacuees were pilgrims who had gone to the temple 
monday to celebrate the anniversary of the day in the 17th century 
when hargobind singh was installed as the sixth guru of the sikh 
faith 
much of the security troops fire tuesday afternoon was directed 
at a watch tower overlooking the main temple entrance shots rang 
out whenever men appeared in the tower in their highly visible 
saffroncolored turbans the headgear of sikh men no sikhs were 
seen returning fire and reporters could not tell if any of them 
were hit 
an officer at a machine gun post outside the golden temple said 
he had orders to fire at anyone seen atop the tower or trying to 
escape 
we have them under control for now but they also have their 
weapons trained on us said the officer who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
punjab state police chief kps gill said it was impossible for 
any militant to escape the cordon we have drawn up a very tight 
ring he said 
the temple complex has at least 17 exits in a halfdozen places 
the boundary wall is low enough to jump over 
the decision whether to storm the temple has to come from 
the top but we are ready said aa siddiqui deputy inspector 
of police 
most sikhs would view any such action as a desecration prime 
minister indira gandhis decision to storm the temple in june 1984 
to oust militants led to her assassination by sikh bodyguards that 
same year 
the militants violent campaign for an independent homeland 
began in 1982 and has claimed at least 940 lives in punjab so far 
this year

panamanian president manuel solis palma has 
ordered the closing of a number of panamanian consulates in the 
united states an opposition leader said tuesday 
ambassador juan b sosa who has remained loyal to ousted 
president eric arturo delvalle said most of the consulates 
informed of the move were staffed by personnel who also are 
delvalle supporters 
he said money that the prodelvalle consulates had been 
receiving from official services had been placed in escrow accounts 
rather than being sent to panama 
the reagan administration like sosa does not recognize the 
legitimacy of the solis palma government and had no comment on the 
reported action 
sosa said the offices received word they were being shut down on 
monday they include offices in washington new york seattle san 
diego atlanta and los angeles he said 
it was unclear whether prodelvalle diplomats would attempt to 
keep the consulates operating despite the shutdown order 
panamanian sources told the washington times that the panamanian 
government stopped short of ordering home the diplomats affected by 
the shutdowns

the senate trying to decide what to do with 
one of its most sacred cows voted approval of a plan tuesday that 
eventually could mean some of the nations 3600 military 
installations may be shut down 
this is the stickiest wicket in this bill said sen alan 
dixon dill as he acknowledged the political sensitivity of the 
baseclosing provision which is part of the pentagon budget bill 
now on the senate floor 
the plan approved on an 8313 vote provides for the creation 
of a 15member commission that will review the nations 3600 
military facilities to determine which of them can be closed 
the panels report will be sent to defense secretary frank 
carlucci by next dec 31 and he will then have 15 days to either 
accept or reject all the commission recommendations that means 
carlucci who supports the baseclosing plan might order closures 
only five days before the reagan administration leaves office 
military bases mean jobs and for more than a decade congress 
has effectively blocked the closure of any bases by requiring 
lengthy detailed environmental studies about proposed base 
closings 
pentagon officials have estimated that closing unneeded military 
bases could save between 2 billion and 5 billion a year 
there is a perception in the country and i think its 
accurate that congress cannot act to close a single base because 
of the political ramifications said sen john mccain rariz 
its time some bases went no matter whose state they are in 
sen strom thurmond rnc agreed he noted that the real 
issue is one that concerns each of us and that is the potential 
loss of jobs in our states and resulting economic dislocations 
these are very real concerns 
the commission plan was first proposed as a way to take congress 
off the hook for recommending which bases should be closed but the 
original plan was to create a ninemember commission which was 
tentatively announced last week by carlucci 
that ran into opposition in the senate where some legislators 
said a congressional voice was needed for such a panel 
dixon originally proposed adding six house and senate members to 
the commission but that idea was dropped during a long day of 
backstage negotiations 
finally dixon approved a compromise plan that would have 
carlucci appoint six more members for a total of 13 the final six 
would be named after carlucci consults with key legislators 
the plan also includes a provision that any action by carlucci 
could only be blocked if both the house and senate vote to do so 
our communities rely on these bases said sen carl levin 
dmich when these bases are closed it better not look 
political 
levin supported the congressionally approved members as a way to 
add credibility to a pentagon panel which legislators fear will 
base its findings on previous defense department studies of which 
bases should be closed 
senate minority leader bob dole of kansas agreed that closing 
installations is sensitive but added i hope we can close 
some i know there are some that are unneeded 
the commission plan is not part of the house version of its 
defense bill which that chamber is scheduled to finally approve on 
wednesday house leaders say it will be considered soon in separate 
legislation 
the pentagon budget bills which will be approved separately in 
each chamber eventually will go to a conference committee to 
reconcile differences including the baseclosing plan 
both bills authorize 2995 billion in defense spending for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1

american union officials tuesday displayed a 
red and white banner reading break chains on solidarnosc 
polands free union on the building across the street from the 
soviet embassy 
we are here this sign is here to support the polish workers 
in their fight to have free trade unions said william h 
bywater president of the 200000member international union of 
electronic electrical salaried machine and furniture workers 
iue 
at the same time we are sending a message to the soviet union 
about their client state and they talk about changes more 
democracy if they are the worker state they are not treating the 
workers very well he said the iue building has constantly 
displayed a banner a solidarnosc solidarity flag or both 
since 1983 
bywater told reporters tuesday that the unions support of the 
workers in poland was shared throughout the us labor movement he 
said he will ask iue members to send financial support to the 
solidarity endowment a nonprofit group developed to aid the 
outlawed solidarity labor movement in poland 
peter mroczyk president of the endowment said the group hoped 
to raise 1 million in the next year to aid the families of jailed 
polish workers send machinery clothes supplies and to support 
publications 
we want to send a very strong signal to solidarity and to the 
people of poland that they are not alone they have not been 
forgotten mroczyk said 
the iue action coincided with the current wave of strikes in 
poland that began april 25 it has been polands worst period of 
labor unrest since martial law was declared and solidarity outlawed 
in 1981 
iue local 201 board member krzysztof kris czarnecki of lynn 
mass left poland as a child in 1965 he said his uncles had to 
return this week because the polish government would not let their 
families leave 
this morning they said they were going to give the workers a 
raise but you cant buy anything with it theres no food there to 
buy he said 
my uncle joseph was part of the solidarity in gdansk but on a 
very limited level everybodys afraid the government is after 
them on every corner if they are not after the people themselves 
they are their wives or whatever they live in constant fear 
czarnecki said in an interview 
before he left my uncle said to me you can chain us but 
you cant chain our hearts he said 
shipyard workers in gdansk ended their strike without settlement 
on tuesday but a sixth strike was expected to begin monday at a 
tractor factory on the outskirts of warsaw

reputed mob boss nicodemo little nicky 
scarfo grinned and raised his hand in a victory salute tuesday 
after a jury acquitted him and eight associates of the slaying of 
rival salvatore testa 
not guilty forewoman ollie minze intoned 27 times to the 
charges of murder conspiracy and possession of an instrument of 
crime three counts for each defendant 
friends and relatives in the crowded city hall courtroom 
cheered wept and applauded 
i love the american judicial system scarfos son nicodemo 
jr said afterwards 
he had been in court every day with other relatives supporting 
his jailed father an atlantic city nj cement contractor said 
by authorities to head the philadelphiasouthern new jersey mob 
the regional crime family has been decimated in the past decade 
by bloody internal warfare arrests and convictions 
testas body was found sept 14 1984 in a wooded area near a 
highway in southern new jersey 
the 59yearold scarfo nattily attired in a navy gabardine 
suit has been in prison since his arrest in january 1987 for 
conspiring to extort 1 million from a philadelphia developer he 
is serving a 15year sentence for that crime 
the acquittal was the second court victory in six months for 
scarfo who was cleared in december on drug charges 
stunned by the verdict assistant district attorney barbara 
christie asked that the jury be polled ms christie had described 
scarfo as an organizedcrime executioner who marked mob members 
for immediate death when they questioned his authority 
scarfos attorney robert simone was elated with the verdict 
the second case in a row that he had won acquittal for his client 
and other mob members 
the defendants had been accused of criminal activities by two 
exgangsters who turned government informants because they said 
scarfo had ordered them killed 
in december scarfo was found innocent of federal drug 
racketeering charges and the chief evidence against him and six 
associates came from nicholas nicky crow caramandi and thomas 
tommy del delgiorno who had successfully testified against him 
in an extortion case 
simone branded the two former mobsters as liars and admitted 
murderers who could not be believed 
simone said the latest acquittals were a signal to the whole 
country that you just dont persecute people because of their 
alleged associations and activities 
the office of district attorney ronald castille said in a brief 
statement we really dont have any comment beyond the fact that 
we are obviously disappointed

an engineer killed in a commuter train crash 
last month had traces of marijuana in his system and a 
dispatchers urine showed traces of morphine and codeine the 
federal railroad administration said tuesday 
tests showed that three other metronorth commuter railroad 
employees connected to the collision also had drugs in their 
systems the agency said 
in washington agency chief john riley called for mandatory 
random drug testing of railroad employees he said that in the past 
16 months rail accidents in which at least one employee tested 
positive for drugs have occurred at a rate of one every 10 days 
this insanity has got to stop he said 
the morphine traces found in dispatcher thomas furlongs urine 
are comparable to those which could be expected following heroin 
use said lou brott an agency spokesman 
the engineer raymond hunter was killed when his train slammed 
into the rear of another empty commuter train april 6 in mount 
vernon the stamford conn resident tested positive for marijuana 
in his urine and his blood the agency said 
metronorth officials have blamed hunter 42 for failing to 
activate an automatic safety system that could have prevented the 
collision they also have said the train appeared to be traveling 
well over the 15 mph speed limit when the accident occurred 
the other employees who tested positive for narcotics block 
operators peter faber 36 of mount vernon and george torres 35 
of new york city and leverman william jones 37 of mount vernon 
have been absolved of responsibility for the crash said susan 
gilbert a metronorth spokeswoman 
edward yule president of the united transportation union which 
represents the men was out of his office tuesday and could not 
immediately be reached for comment 
faber and torres showed traces of butalbital a barbiturate in 
their urine and blood and jones had traces marijuana in his 
according to the fra 
like dispatcher furlong they were suspended after the accident 
and now face a disciplinary hearing on charges based on the drug 
test results 
riley declined to say if the tests indicated whether drugs might 
have affected the mens performances he said a final report on the 
accident to be released in about two months will determine the 
role drug use played in the incident 
nicholas lappas a professor in george washington universitys 
department of forensic sciences said it was difficult to 
determine based on the amounts of drugs found in the mens 
systems whether any of them was under the influence of drugs at 
the time of the accident 
metronorth employees found to have used drugs on the job must 
enter a substance abuse program or face dismissal they also are 
subject to spot drug testing while in the program

a bill authorizing the united states to join 
76 other countries as a signatory to a 102yearold treaty on 
copyright protection of literary and artistic works was approved 
unanimously tuesday by the house 
the vote on the socalled berne convention was 4200 separate 
legislation ratifying the treaty is awaiting action by the senate 
which is expected to vote within the next few months 
supporters of us adherence to the treaty say it will provide 
improved copyright protection for american creative works 
including computer technology and musical records and tapes 
against foreign piracy and counterfeiting 
the bill lacks a moral rights provision sought primarily by 
movie directors and screenwriters to prevent colorizing and other 
alterations in films sold to television broadcasters 
to conform with the treaty the bill changes us copyright law 
to eliminate a requirement that to have copyright protection a 
published work must indicate that it is copyrighted such a 
designation henceforth would be voluntary 
the bill clarifies that pictorial graphic and sculptural 
works receiving copyright protection include architectural plans 
the measure also would replace compulsory jukebox licenses with 
voluntary negotiations between jukebox operators and composers of 
copyrighted music for payment of royalties and fees with a 
provision for compulsory licenses if negotiations fail

the interior department said tuesay it had 
singled out areas in california nevada utah and wyoming for 
further study of contamination caused by irrigation drainage water 
the four areas are the salton sea in california the stillwater 
wildlife management area in nevada the middle green river basin in 
utah and the kendrick irrigation project in wyoming 
the departments announcement gave few specifics on its 
researchers findings of contaminants in water sediment and 
wildlife tissue the information compiled during two years of 
research is available in larger reports which were not distributed 
with the announcement 
in a statement interior secretary donald p hodel said some 
localized problems related to irrigation drainage water do exist 
hodel also said the more detailed work we will undertake will 
provide the scientific understanding necessary to mitigate or 
resolve the problems we have found 
researchers were looking for trace elements notably selenium 
easily liberated from many western soils radioactivity pesticide 
residues and other chemicals 
selenium is a trace element necessary for nutrition in minute 
amounts but toxic in larger doses extraordinarily high 
concentrations were put in the kesterson wildlife refuge in 
california by drain water from the westlands water district 
forcing the closing of the drain after largescale deaths of 
waterfowl 
the onepage summaries released tuesday provided some data only 
for the green river area and the significance of those findings 
was not explained 
summaries also were released for the laguna atascosa national 
wildlife refuge in texas the milk and sun river irrigation 
projects in montana tulare lake in california and the lower 
colorado river bordering nevada california and arizona at these 
areas more sampling will be done but not on as intensive a 
basis said department spokesman mitch snow 
groundwater drains at stewart lake in the middle green river 
basin contained selenium in concentrations of 14 to 140 parts per 
billion carp taken from the lake contained 31 parts per million 
the livers of coots taken from the lake showed selenium of 49 to 
26 ppm and averaged 32 ppm from coots at north roadside pond water 
in the pond contained as much as 93 ppm selenium 
california authorities warn that selenium concentrations above 2 
ppm or 2000 ppb in food can be dangerous to pregnant women and 
children under 15 the environmental protection agency limits 
drinking water concentrations to 001 ppm or 10 ppb 
the summary for kendrick said selenium concentrations were 
elevated at several locations snow said the larger report 
showed the median concentration of 24 ground and surface water 
samples was 75 ppb 
detailed reports of the salton sea and stillwater areas will not 
be avilable until later this year because additional sampling was 
undertaken there the department said no summaries for those areas 
were released 
the lower colorado river summary said average selenium 
concentrations in fish approach and in some instances exceed 
concentrations that could result in reproductive impairment in 
certain fish but agricultural practicies in the lower colorado 
river valley do not at this time appear to increase selenium 
concentrations 
dde a breakdown product of ddt the pesticide banned 16 years 
ago also was found 
researchers in the tulare lake area found high concentrations of 
unspecified trace elements at the westfarmers ponds according to 
the summary and preliminary evidence of adverse biological 
effects on shorebirds at the westfarmers ponds was obtained 
in montana the freezout lake game management area and the 
benton lake national wildlife refuge had some sites where 
concentrations of unspecified toxic elements in water bottom 
sediment and biota were moderately to extremely high 
at the dry lake unit of the milk river irrigation project 
concentrations of chromium nickel vanadium and zinc were double 
average background levels boron was found in coot livers at levels 
that could impair reproduction 
at sun river nitrates above state standards were found in 
groundwater wells 
at laguna atascosa and in the lower rio grande valley ddt and 
other pesticide residues in fish were lower than they had been in 
the 1970s but still higher than the national baseline and of 
concern

voters delivered a split decision in 
parliamentary elections tuesday leaving unresolved the dispute 
over denmarks ban on nuclear weapons and its allegiance to nato 
complete results showed a small setback for the socialist 
opposition but no gain for prime minister poul schlueters 
centerright minority coalition in the 179member folketing or 
parliament 
schlueter had called the early election hoping to win a clear 
endorsement of denmarks full membership in the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
the social democrats denmarks largest party pushed through a 
resolution in parliament last month designed to reinforce a 1957 
peacetime ban on nuclear weapons on danish territory both the 
united states and britain had expressed opposition to the measure 
only the farright progress party campaigning for lower taxes 
and less immigration improved its standing it won 16 seats seven 
more than it had held before 
schlueters conservative party dropped three seats holding 35 
but they were picked up by other parties in the fourparty 
coalition and the alliance held on to its 70seat total 
the twoparty socialist partnership lost two seats to command 
79 the social democrats will hold 55 seats and the socialist 
peoples party 24 
the swing party socialliberals held 10 a loss of one 
two semiindependent territories the faeroe islands and 
greenland each elect two representativs 
final results showed 3913318 ballts were cast for a turnout of 
858 percent 
schlueter claimed the results would ease denmarks crisis with 
nato 
but social democratic leader svend auken said the election 
showed most voters backed the antinuclear measure that requires 
the government to notify visiting warships of denmarks 1957 ban 
against nuclear weapons during peacetime 
auken said he would continue the battle in the legislature to 
implement the resolution the precise wording of the letter to be 
sent to ship captains remains to be drafted 
schlueter in a television appearance called on auken to 
quietly negotiate a sensible solution to the issue that 
prompted the early election only eight months after the previous 
balloting 
foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen leader of the coalitions 
liberal party said he believed schlueters government could 
continue 
there is still a nonsocialist majority he told a 
television interviewer the other coalition members are the center 
democratic and christian peoples parties 
twelve parties contested the election but only nine won seats 
clearly elated progress party leader morgans glistrup said his 
victory was good for the country 
however the party was not expected to be a factor in coalition 
bargaining since it is shunned by mainstream politicians 
every danish government since 1973 has lacked a majority in 
parliament and danish politics usually are managed through 
backstage bargaining 
before the social democrat resolution passed last month denmark 
took the position that its nato allies abided by the rules 
established in 1957 
the united states and britain said the measure threatened the 
solidarity of the western military alliance and was against their 
own policies which forbid disclosure of which ships carry nuclear 
arms 
britain said the danish action jeopardized its plans to send 
troops in times of crisis to reinforce denmark which controls the 
narrow access to the baltic sea 
unless the resolution is overturned by the new parliament the 
government will have to carry it out after the wording has been 
determined 
schlueter has indicated he would follow the norwegian model 
norway also a nato country with a peacetime nuclear ban reminds 
allies that their ships are expected to abide by norwegian law but 
does not explicitly mention nuclear weapons 
the election came the day before secretary of state george 
shultz was to meet soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in 
geneva to prepare for a moscow summit in two weeks 
the nuclear issue couldnt come at a worse time said a 
diplomat from a nato country who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a perception that denmark is wavering in its support of the 
western alliance could strenghthen the soviets hand 
during the campaign most coalition parties focused on the nato 
issue 
however the opposition stressed economic concerns on which it 
made some gains in the september election

mikhail s gorbachev says there is confusion in 
the minds of many people about his reforms but even those who 
yield to fear may not really oppose social change 
the soviet leader told editors and communist party ideologists 
that conservatism is the biggest threat to perestroika or 
rebuilding society and doubters have questioned whether the nation 
is turning away from communism the speech was delivered saturday 
but not reported until late tuesday 
he did not make clear whether misunderstandings about his plans 
for a more democratic society and stronger economy reached into the 
13man party politburo over which he presides 
party ideologist yegor k ligachev the no 2 man in the 
kremlin is said to favor a more cautious approach to confronting 
economic and social problems than gorbachev but the extent of 
their differences is not clear 
gorbachev told his audience some people have indeed lost 
their bearings amid all these processes under way 
some people have failed to keep their heads and panicked and 
the panic and this is very serious has taken the form of 
asking isnt perestroika coming to mean the wrecking and 
rejection of the values of socialism isnt it giving rise to alien 
phenomena isnt it destabilizing society 
the 57yearold leader added however that not everyone who 
fears his reforms or has resisted them should be labeled an 
opponent of perestroika 
we found veritable confusion in the minds of many people 
workers intellectuals and administrators alike he said and 
let us be blunt not only on the ground level but also on the 
top 
some sources have said ligachev challenged gorbachevs policies 
two months ago in supporting publication of a letter from a 
leningrad teacher who said perestroika was destroying the nation 
built by josef stalin 
a denunciation of the letter in the communist party newspaper 
pravda was viewed by some as a warning to ligachev and 
conservatives that perestroika was above criticism 
gorbachev said many people who were taught inefficient working 
habits simply do not know how to do their jobs any other way 
it is shown that perestroika pinches someone and they start 
resisting hampering the process of renewal of society he said 
but he appeared to forgive those tendencies when he added 
we are all products of our time we have conceived perestroika 
and we also manifest many of the things that inhibit it 
he said the politburo decided he personally should explain the 
reforms and the challenge they represent before the communist party 
conference that begins june 28 the 5000 delegates will redefine 
the partys tasks and are expected to replace conservatives with 
more active supporters of perestroika 
it is necessary to rid socialism of everything 
pseudosocialist distorted and deformed in the period of the 
personality cult gorbachev said in a reference to stalin who 
ruled for 29 years until his death in 1953 
the next few years will be difficult he said but he claimed 
progress in improving health care education and agriculture the 
three years since the april 1985 central committee plenum have 
borne out that we have made the right choice he declared 
referring to the party meeting at which he unveiled his plans 
he concluded by urging the delegates to the june conference to 
give our perestroika a new second wind

the international commission of jurists on tuesday 
accused south african security forces of widespread use of torture 
and violence and said it was part of the governments repressive 
strategy 
a 160page report said children are among the victims 
it said there is evidence that an undemocratic government has 
extended the executive power of the state so as to undermine the 
rule of law and destroy basic human rights 
the 1982 internal security act adopted by south africas 
whiteminority government creates a series of criminal offenses of 
a political character in extremely wide and often vague terms 
according to the report 
it said the security act along with onesided procedural rules 
provides the state with the means of securing the conviction of 
virtually any political opponent 
we have found that the government has allowed intimidation of 
suspects and accused persons and interference with legal processes 
by the security forces to take place on a large scale and in a 
variety of ways 
the report was written by four west european legal experts sent 
to south africa last year by the commission 
they said we stress particularly the widespread use of 
torture and violence even against children which is habitually 
denied by the government and thus goes unpunished though plainly 
illegal even under south african law 
major abuses by the security forces also include the use of 
excessive force including many killings in crowd control 
operations the encouragement of vigilante forces and arrests and 
intimidation of lawyers representing opponents of the government 
the report said 
it added that recent economic and moral pressure has forced a 
degree of relaxation in the formal structure of apartheid but the 
will of the ruling minority to retain popwer seems undiminished 
south africa is faced with a dilemma the authors said a 
repressive strategy has become increasingly necessary to 
contain the huge disenfranchised majority yet the acknowledgment 
of such a strategy cannot be easily reconciled with south africas 
pretensions to legitimacy within the western liberal tradition 
the report was compiled by briton geoffrey bindman jeanmarie 
crettaz of switzerland henry downing of ireland and west german 
guenter witzsch 
they said they were able to travel freely in south africa but 
many who agreed to be interviewed clearly did so at some personal 
risk contacts were maintained so that the report covered 
developments through february 1988 they said 
the international commission of jurists is a genevabased 
nongovernmental organization and its members include up to 40 
jurists from noncommunist countries in various parts of the world 
by south african law and custom apartheid establishes a 
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services

senate majority leader robert c byrd appealed 
to the kremlin on tuesday to help end the dispute over onsite 
inspection that is blocking senate action on the mediumrange 
missile treaty 
the soviets hold the key byrd told the senate 
but byrd said that although senate action on the pact has been 
temporarily put on the back burner he could call it up for 
debate friday if negotiations in geneva between secretary of state 
george p shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
resolve the issue 
byrd said he would need an ironclad commitment from the soviets 
in writing 
president reagan had urged the senate to ratify the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty before his moscow summit 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev begins may 29 however 
white house officials acquiesced monday in the bipartisan decision 
by senate leaders to delay debate on the treaty due to the 
outstanding disputes 
the chairman and vice chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee said meanwhile that the treaty cannot be ratified if 
the soviets continue to balk on onsite verification procedures 
chairman david boren dokla and vice chairman william cohen 
dmaine commented after delivering a report to senate leaders 
apparently resolving an unrelated dispute over the inclusion in the 
treaty of such futuristic weapons as those employing laser rays or 
particle beam generators 
the treaty is silent on such weapons although administration 
negotiators contended futuristic weapons were included under the 
pacts ban on any mediumrange weapon no matter what it uses to 
destroy or damage a target 
while there are many problems associated with monitoring 
futuristic weapons the committee believes that on balance us 
interests in monitoring the treaty are better served by banning 
missiles using current or future weapons technologies to damage or 
destroy a target than by excluding them from the scope of the 
treaty the panels letter said 
otherwise the committee contended us intelligence would be 
hard pressed to tell the difference between unbanned futuristic 
weapons and those armed with nuclear or conventional warheads which 
were banned 
cohen said the remaining roadblock remains the untenable 
position he said the soviets have taken on onsite inspection 
there has to be an absolute meeting of the minds on that 
before i can agree to support the treaty cohen said 
he added that unless the soviets back down and resolve the 
dispute the treaty cannot be ratified 
boren added its just a matter of whether the soviets have 
the political will to say they are willing to live up to the 
commitments on onsite inspection 
if they dont have that will then there is a very serious 
problem for the treaty he said some vague cosmetic language 
coming back from geneva just wont do the trick 
earlier some democratic senators reportedly protested delay on 
the treaty which requires the elimination of all groundlaunched 
missiles with a range of 315 to 3125 miles expressing concern 
that reagan and gorbachev would be unable to make further arms 
control progress at their moscow summit if the accord is not 
ratified by then 
but byrd declared the senate would certainly look foolish to 
go into debate with these matters that need fixing hanging out 
there 
i cant go ahead with it if there are multitudinous or even 
one gap through which the soviets can cheat said byrd dwva 
speaking to reporters he said it could be resolved in a 
matter of hours in a matter of days or it might never be 
resolved 
sen james exon dneb told the senate we are asking the 
soviets to put up or shut up on onsite inspection 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said onsite inspection represents the chief value of 
the treaty to the arms control process because it can lead the way 
to effective verification of a far more sweeping agreement to 
reduce longrange nuclear weapons by as much as 50 percent 
the issue will be discussed when shultz confers with 
shevardnadze at geneva on wednesday and thursday nunn said it is 
important that it be satisfactorily resolved at that time 
byrd agreed saying the soviets can resolve this fast the 
thing that can expedite this is for the administration and the 
soviets to sit down and close these loopholes 
we dont want to give the soviets loopholes to cheat he 
said this obviously needs fixing and the time to fix it is 
before the senate takes up the treaty 
nunn told the senate we will learn whether we indeed have a 
breakthrough in onsite inspection if onsite inspection fails we 
will have a catastrophe 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the administration backs the delay in the senate debate 
we feel this is a prudent and reasonable course of action 
he said there is unanimity between the administration and the 
bipartisan senate leadership that these problems should be 
satisfactorily and promptly resolved prior to ratification 
assistant senate republican leader alan simpson of wyoming and 
sen richard lugar rind emerging from a morning meeting with 
president reagan said they were confident that the problems can be 
surmounted 
i think that they will do their usual good job of splicing 
things back together again simpson said referring to the 
shultzshevardnadze meeting

the number of confirmed cases of legionnaires 
disease in the outbreak at the headquarters of the british 
broadcasting corp rose to 24 tuesday with seven victims seriously 
ill public health officials said 
they reported there are 45 other suspected cases 
the westminster borough officials said new cases could develop 
over the next few days but the risk of infection has been 
eliminated by the disinfection of air conditioning systems at the 
bbc headquarters where the outbreak began in midapril 
symptoms similar to pneumonia are produced by the disease which 
can be caused by bacteria from watercooled air conditioning units 
the disease is named after an outbreak at the american legion 
convention in philadelphia in 1976 doctors say it is fatal in 
about 15 percent of cases

the bahamian government took out a 
fullpage advertisement tuesday in us and caribbean newspapers in 
an attempt at setting the record straight about new allegations 
of corruption and lack of antidrug efforts 
the bahamas decided to buy the ads as part of its response to 
charges of bahamian drug corruption raised in various quarters 
including the federal trial of colombias reputed drug kingpin 
carlos lehder rivas government spokesman bill kalis said 
the ad in the new york times washington post miami herald and 
other newspapers was addressed to the people of the united states 
of america and signed by bahamian attorney general paul l 
adderly 
it says the commonwealth of the bahamas has devoted much of its 
limited resources to fighting drugs and needs more us aid 
specifically the ad cites the need for more air search radar 
installations more joint bases strategically located with 
helicopter strike force teams more air reconnaissance patrols 
more sea patrols and intensified joint undercover and conspiracy 
investigations 
it says the archipelago of 700 islands and keys and 250000 
people spends 13 percent of its national budget on law enforcement 
mostly fighting drugs produced in south america and bound for users 
in the united states 
published reports have said grand juries in tampa and miami are 
investigating prime minister sir lynden o pindling and reports in 
congress have raised doubts about bahamian drugfighting efforts 
he started thinking about this during these latest allegations 
at the lehder trial kalis said 
as you know the position was not to respond while the 
testimony was being heard now that the testimony is over the 
prime minister wanted to take an opportunity to make the bahamian 
position better known 
during lehders trial in jacksonville us attorney robert 
merkle had produced testimony that pindling was receiving drug 
payoffs of up to 5 million lehder allegedly used normans cay in 
the bahamas as a key transfer point for colombian cocaine bound for 
florida and georgia 
adderlys advertisement tuesday called attention to a 1984 royal 
commission of inquiry report in the bahamas that criticized lack of 
cooperation by us authorities during its probe into official drug 
corruption that commission found evidence of drug corruption in 
some levels of the bahamian government and law enforcement but did 
not tie pindling to drug payoffs 
last week pindling issued a statement to the news media and at 
a rally flatly denying taking drug payoffs 
pindling said he was not surprised by the allegations at 
lehders trial but would be surprised if any of the grand juries 
reportedly investigating his affairs indicted him 
pindling was reelected last year after criticizing the 
corruption allegations which first surfaced in a 1983 report he 
has been in power since breaking the hold of the whiteminority 
government in 1967

the government has signed a peace 
agreement with a sinhalese extremist group accused of killing at 
least 260 people during the past nine months president junius r 
jayewardene said tuesday 
we have signed an agreement with the peoples liberation front 
with a hope to end bloodshed to bring back peace in sri lanka 
jayewardene said he spoke during an award ceremony at a police 
targetshooting contest in colombo 
national security minister lalith athulathmudali told a news 
conference the accord calls for members of the front to lay down 
their arms by may 29 and cease all attacks immediately 
jayewardene said that as part of the agreement he has lifted a 
fiveyearold ban on political activities by the front and 20 
affiliated student organizations and trade unions 
he said he would soon release all front members who have been 
detained except for those charged with murder or attempted murder 
a front representative said 4000 front members are imprisoned 
the peoples liberation front has said it was defending the 
interests of the island nations sinhalese majority against demands 
of the tamil minority 
tamils most of whom are hindus form 18 percent of the islands 
population of 16 million they claim the buddhist sinhalese 
discriminate against them 
tamil militants have been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy 
or an independent homeland in predominantly tamil northern and 
eastern sri lanka 
the peoples liberation front opposes an agreement signed in 
july by sri lank and india to end the separatist campaign by tamil 
guerrillas it said the pact made too many concessions to the 
tamils 
india has at least 50000 soldiers in sri lanka off indias 
southern coast to disarm tamil rebels and enforce the july 29 
accord 
indias population of 800 million includes 60 million tamils 
athulathmudali who is a sinhalese said he and peoples 
liberation front leader rohana wijeweera signed the peace 
agreement wijeweera did not appear at the cabinet ministers news 
conference but the front was represented by kelly senanayake a 
23yearold lawyer 
senanayake said in an interview that 4000 front members were in 
prison and most would be released after the organizations 
guerrillas surrender their weapons to the government 
he said the guerrilas have not begun turning in their arms 
many of the victims of front guerrillas were government 
officials 
authorities have blamed the front for two attacks on sri lankan 
military installations and the assassinations of at least five 
candidates for provincial elections in central and southern sri 
lanka in recent weeks 
the government said front guerrillas tried to assassinate 
jayewardene by exploding a bomb in parliament last august 
jayewardene escaped injury but the blast killed two people and 
injured several others including athulathmudali

a san francisco man was convicted tuesday of 
firstdegree murder in five killings thought to be part of the 
trailside slayings in northern california parks eight years ago 
the jury also convicted david j carpenter 58 of raping two of 
his victims and trying to rape a third the panel will reconvene 
may 17 to decide whether carpenter should be executed or spend the 
rest of his life in prison 
he already has been convicted and sentenced to the gas chamber 
for two related 1981 murders in santa cruz county parks 
the marin killing spree left many popular hiking trails and 
parks in northern california virtually deserted until carpenters 
arrest in san francisco in may 1981 
the jury convicted carpenter for the 1980 slayings of five 
hikers in two marin county parks point reyes national seashore and 
mount tamalpais state park the trial was held in san diego because 
of extensive publicity in northern california 
a ballistics expert said each victim was killed by a 38caliber 
bullet fired from the same weapon 
the superior court jury returned the verdict at the end of its 
second day of deliberations 
thats an awful quick verdict in this case marin county 
deputy district attorney john posey said it certainly seems to 
suggest they didnt buy anything the defense presented 
it came as a surprise to have an unfavorable verdict as fast 
as this said marin county public defender frank cox 
carpenter is philosophical about it 
carpenter who testified for eight days in his own defense 
showed no visible emotion as superior court judge herbert b 
hoffman read the verdict 
in his testimony carpenter had claimed he was miles away from 
the crime scenes when the killings occurred 
more than 500 items were entered into evidence and 91 witnesses 
testified during the fourmonth trial 
defense attorneys argued carpenter deserved acquittal because of 
serious doubts created by what they termed questionable police 
procedures and inconsistencies in the witnesses testimony linking 
carpenter to the undisputed murder weapon 
the prosecution contended carpenter was a coldblooded killer 
whose ultimate goal was to commit murder and rape and get away with 
it

the marxist government said tuesday 
its soldiers routed eritrean rebels besieging a strategic town it 
was the first official report of an army victory in the northern 
war 
the government newspaper ethiopia herald said the battle 
occurred recently near keren 55 miles from asmara the capital of 
eritrea province 
rebels of the eritrean peoples liberation front have been 
entrenched in hills around keren since april and have tried several 
times to capture it the front has been fighting for independence 
for the province for more than 25 years 
the newspaper said the army made a significant breakthrough 
and was advancing after smashing the rebels 
its report indicated the army had begun the counterattack 
president mengistu haile mariam promised march 31 at that time he 
acknowledged the war for the first time by saying soldiers were 
involved in a grim struggle with guerrillas in the north 
rebels suffered heavy casualties in the battle at keren the 
herald said but it gave no figures it said the army captured 
rocket launchers ammunition and guns 
ethiopian journalists visited the front and were briefed by 
field commanders who said army morale was unprecedently high 
according to the newspaper report 
western diplomats in ethiopia have reported low morale in the 
military following a dispute between mengistu and five top army 
commanders mengistu purportedlu ordered at least one of the 
commandersm put to death during a visit to the war zone in march 
eritrean rebels and those in neighboring tigre province have 
claimed many victories and captured several towns since launching 
an offensive in february 
neither government nor rebel claims can be confirmed and both 
sides often exaggerate 
tesfai ghermazien an eritrean rebel spokesman in washington 
dc claimed there had been no significant fighting around keren 
since a big battle 10 days ago in which the rebels claimed to have 
killed or captured 860 soldiers 
apart from a few un personnel in asmara and several church 
workers in both provinces no westerners remain in northern 
ethiopia since the government expulsion of foreign relief workers 
april 6 
the war and expulsions have endangered the lives of 3 million 
drought victims in eritrea and tigre the provinces most affected 
by a drought that threatens 7 million people in ethiopia

voters delivered a split decision in 
parliamentary elections tuesday leaving unresolved the dispute 
over denmarks ban on nuclear weapons and its allegiance to nato 
complete results showed a small setback for the socialist 
opposition but no gain for prime minister poul schlueters 
centerright minority coalition in the 179member folketing or 
parliament 
schlueter had called the early election hoping to win a clear 
endorsement of denmarks full membership in the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
the social democrats denmarks largest party pushed through a 
resolution in parliament last month designed to reinforce a 1957 
peacetime ban on nuclear weapons on danish territory both the 
united states and britain had expressed opposition to the measure 
only the farright progress party campaigning for lower taxes 
and less immigration improved its standing it won 16 seats seven 
more than it had held before 
schlueters conservative party dropped three seats holding 35 
but they were picked up by other parties in the fourparty 
coalition and the alliance held on to its 70seat total 
the twoparty socialist partnership lost two seats to command 
79 the social democrats will hold 55 seats and the socialist 
peoples party 24 
the swing party socialliberals held 10 a loss of one 
two semiindependent territories the faeroe islands and 
greenland each elect two representativs 
final results showed 3913318 ballts were cast for a turnout of 
858 percent 
schlueter claimed the results would ease denmarks crisis with 
nato 
but social democratic leader svend auken said the election 
showed most voters backed the antinuclear measure that requires 
the government to notify visiting warships of denmarks 1957 ban 
against nuclear weapons during peacetime 
auken said he would continue the battle in the legislature to 
implement the resolution the precise wording of the letter to be 
sent to ship captains remains to be drafted 
schlueter in a television appearance called on auken to 
quietly negotiate a sensible solution to the issue that 
prompted the early election only eight months after the previous 
balloting 
foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen leader of the coalitions 
liberal party said he believed schlueters government could 
continue 
there is still a nonsocialist majority he told a 
television interviewer the other coalition members are the center 
democratic and christian peoples parties 
twelve parties contested the election but only nine won seats 
clearly elated progress party leader morgans glistrup said his 
victory was good for the country 
however the party was not expected to be a factor in coalition 
bargaining since it is shunned by mainstream politicians 
every danish government since 1973 has lacked a majority in 
parliament and danish politics usually are managed through 
backstage bargaining 
before the social democrat resolution passed last month denmark 
took the position that its nato allies abided by the rules 
established in 1957 
the united states and britain said the measure threatened the 
solidarity of the western military alliance and was against their 
own policies which forbid disclosure of which ships carry nuclear 
arms 
britain said the danish action jeopardized its plans to send 
troops in times of crisis to reinforce denmark which controls the 
narrow access to the baltic sea 
unless the resolution is overturned by the new parliament the 
government will have to carry it out after the wording has been 
determined 
schlueter has indicated he would follow the norwegian model 
norway also a nato country with a peacetime nuclear ban reminds 
allies that their ships are expected to abide by norwegian law but 
does not explicitly mention nuclear weapons 
the election came the day before secretary of state george 
shultz was to meet soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in 
geneva to prepare for a moscow summit in two weeks 
the nuclear issue couldnt come at a worse time said a 
diplomat from a nato country who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a perception that denmark is wavering in its support of the 
western alliance could strenghthen the soviets hand 
during the campaign most coalition parties focused on the nato 
issue 
however the opposition stressed economic concerns on which it 
made some gains in the september election

the united states spends more for the defense 
of nato than do western european nations according to a 
congressional study released tuesday as part of a longrunning 
debate 
the review was done by the congressional budget office which 
conlcuded that while allied contributions are sometimes 
substantial the united states devotes a larger share of its 
resources to the common defense than most of its allies 
the study was the latest round in the debate over financing the 
16nation north atlantic treaty organization 
us officials have argued that nato nations particularly in 
western europe need to do more for the alliance defense but nato 
leaders have repeatedly answered that european countries do more 
for nato than americans believe 
the cbo study used a figure it defined as the gross domestic 
product which is the share of economic resources devoted by a 
nation to its national security 
by that standard the cbo said the united states devoted 67 
percent of its gross domestic product to defense in 1986 by 
comparison the average for nonus nato countries was 33 percent 
while japan spent about 1 percent 
the review also compared per capita defense spending and 
concluded that in 1986 the united states spent 1115 per person 
for defense compared to 318 in nonus nato countries and 163 
for the japanese 
this gap has narrowed somewhat since 1986 because of the 
decline in the value of the dollar but remains substantial the 
cbo concluded the study used 1986 because the cbo said that was 
the last full year for which the data was available 
european leaders have answered that the figures arent accurate 
because some european countries draft soldiers unlike the united 
states which has an allvolunteer military those leaders have 
argued that if their recruits werent drafted but were paid market 
wages like in the united states their defense budgets would thus 
be higher 
the cbo answered that conscription does reduce the defense 
budgets of some allies but it also results in a less experienced 
military that may not be as productive or as well trained as a 
volunteer military 
the united states has about 325000 military personnel stationed 
in europe the administration has successfully opposed efforts in 
congress to reduce that total unless us allies spend more

a deathrow inmate who requested a lump 
of dirt for his final meal and insisted he wanted to be executed 
early wednesday was given a reprieve tuesday by the us supreme 
court in an appeal by his mother 
the high court granted the stay for james smith about six hours 
before the scheduled execution no vote among the justices was 
released 
alexzene hamilton of indianapolis filed the appeal with the 
supreme court on monday contending her son was mentally 
incompetent her attorneys also contended mitigating evidence was 
not allowed to be considered by jurors who sentenced smith to death 
the order just says a stay was granted assistant texas 
attorney general bill zapalac said its anybodys guess what 
they mean 
im praising god right now mrs hamilton said thats all 
i can say i just thank god 
smith was informed of the development as he waited in a holding 
cell next to the death chamber 
when they told him about the stay he gritted his teeth and 
said something unintelligible said texas department of 
corrections spokesman charles brown 
brown said smith was later transferred back to his usual cell 
smith would have been the 28th prisoner executed in texas more 
than any other state and the 99th nationally since the supreme 
court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976 
smith 37 convicted of the 1983 robberyslaying of a houston 
insurance office manager has no attorney and has resisted attempts 
for legal help from capital punishment opponents 
i dont understand all this clinging to life smith said in 
a recent interview life is a temporary situation the spirit 
moves on death is like eating a prune in the morning its a 
natural function 
on tuesday he requested rhaeakunda dirt for his final meal 
a request texas department of corrections officials said would 
not be honored 
its not food its not sanitary prison spokesman david 
nunnelee said hell be offered something off the regular prison 
menu 
officials could not immediately explain what was meant by the 
type of dirt texas aampm university soil experts said it was not an 
identifiable soil but believed it may be a dirt used in voodoo 
rituals in such rituals the dirt is eaten school spokeswoman 
mary jo powell said 
smith has said he believes in and has practiced voodoo 
smith a former tarotcard dealer in new orleans who was working 
as a houston taxi driver at the time of his arrest was convicted 
for the 1983 shooting death of larry rohus 
testimony showed he was tackled by witnesses while fleeing the 
shooting scene and that a gun he was carrying was linked to the 
slaying 
witnesses said rohus father of a 1yearold son complied with 
smiths demands and filled a small trash can with cash then was 
shot through the heart as he pleaded for his life 
i dont think justice could ever be done totally said 
rohus wife deborah who since has remarried and now lives in 
north carolina the only way for that is for larry to be alive 
and thats not going to happen i think this will help my son 
when he grows up and is old enough to understand whats going on 
smith repeatedly has said he is innocent but says he does not 
want to spend his life on death row 
its not craziness its determination he said other 
inmates say im crazy the strangest person theyve run into but 
thats because they dont understand my rationale all my life ive 
been a loner im very good at doing that 
if he desired smith virtually was assured of an execution stay 
from the supreme court because the high court is considering a 
challenge to the texas death penalty law 
i have no forgiveness im not sentimental smith said 
let me get my execution over and leave me alone

lech walesa and 1000 fellow workers left 
the lenin shipyard tuesday night with heads held high but with no 
settlement declaring that their eightday strike showed poles they 
must fight to win 
bearing a cross and two polish flags they marched slowly from 
the yard the 1980 birthplace of solidarity shortly after 8 pm 
2 pm edt police stepped back silently and let them pass 
townspeople applauded from balconies and sidewalks as the 
procession walked three blocks to st brygidas church a 
stronghold of solidarity 
as the workers approached bells pealed and supporters rushed to 
embrace walesa and other strike leaders offering them flowers and 
kisses 
we thank you we thank you the crowd chanted 
walesa was a founder of solidarity the soviet blocs first and 
only independent trade union movement the federation was outlawed 
in 1982 but the workers declared tuesday night its a new 
spring for solidarity 
walesa was not among those who launched this strike on may 2 
but he vowed to be the last to leave 
at the church walesa shrugged off questions saying only no 
freedom without solidarity after his wife danuta embraced him 
he teased her whos taking care of the house 
the walesas have eight children 
up to tuesday night police had kept a tight blockade around the 
sprawling shipyard whose towering cranes dominate the skyline of 
this baltic port city we decided to make a sovereign decision to 
leave the shipyard without an agreement with the authorities 
said a statement issued by the strikers 
the workers decided tuesday evening to end the sitin strike for 
higher pay and union rights the strike committee recommended the 
move in a 132 vote strikers said 
it was the last in a string of five strikes that began april 25 
polands worst wave of labor unrest since the 1981 martial law 
crackdown 
we are convinced that we were right in the protest against 
relations in poland against treating us in a way that violates 
human dignity against the arrogance of the authorities who are 
responsible for the crisis the workers statement said 
poland is deep in crisis and the authorities treat the country 
as their own property we leave not in triumph but with raised 
heads our strike should make everybody aware that one has to fight 
to win 
the statement concluded its a new spring for solidarity 
i think we accomplished something we gained general agreement 
on the other side that we exist said piotr konopka an aide to 
walesa 
walesa 44 and winner of the 1983 nobel peace prize still 
works as an electrician at the 12000worker lenin shipyard most 
of his 1000 followers who remained on strike to the end were in 
their late teens and early 20s 
roman catholic bishop tadeusz goclowski of gdansk whose 
intervention paved the way for the first talks with management 
saturday expressed joy at the strikers decision saying 
the strike ended at the initiative of the striking polish 
workers i express my hope that the authorities will respect their 
promises to guarantee their workers personal and professional 
safety 
he said he hoped recently imprisoned activists now would be 
released 
the staterun news agency pap briefly reported the mens 
departure from the yard 
staterun television announced the strikes end and showed 
police pulling down banners in the deserted yard there was no 
immediate official statement nothing was said about when the 
shipyard would reopen 
strike committee chairman alojzy szablewski a 62yearold 
engineer once imprisoned for leading a strike at the yard said 
we didnt lose anything the communists lost i wanted to 
avoid the police taking them out there were many wonderful young 
men there and i could not allow them to be beaten 
solidarity lives fights and will win said the rev henryk 
jankowski pastor of st brygidas and a solidarity adviser as 
about 4000 strikers and supporters gathered for a prayer service 
talks had broken off monday after strikers rejected a management 
offer that would have made them abandon their quest to legalize 
solidarity 
after the alleged detention and beating of two striker couriers 
late monday strikers complained of increasing difficulty in 
getting food into the shipyard 
early tuesday government spokesman jerzy urban said the absence 
of further strikes in poland proved the strikes and protests have 
not won the support of the working class and society 
referring to the 198081 labor turmoil he said workers decided 
not to enter the same river twice a river in which we all caught 
a bad cold 
the strikers had demanded monthly raises of at least 38 based 
on their current average of about 105 reinstatement of fired 
solidarity activists recognition of a solidarity local at the 
yard freedom for political prisoners and amnesty for strikers 
they announced a new demand tuesday preservation of the 
shipyard in its present status it came after management said the 
yards future was uncertain because of financial difficulties 
walesa who led the hostoric august 1980 strike initially 
distanced himself from this stoppage but he was gradually drawn 
into it and the younger generation of workers the backbone of the 
strike treated him as unofficial leader 
police staged a raid thursday to crush a strike at the lenin 
steelworks in nowa huta in southern poland 
other strikes in the labor unrest were settled peacefully at a 
heavy machinery plant in stalowa wola and by transit workers in 
the cities of bydgoszcz and szczecin 
on tuesday urban told his weekly news conference in warsaw the 
government was retreating from a proposal to ban all strikes

if convicted crawford 27 could be dishonorably discharged 
stripped of rank and sentenced to up to 10 years behind bars 
elmer 28 has tested negative three times for antibodies to the

me i know i said it crawford said she said i can burn 
you 
crawford said elmer then repeated that she loved him and wanted 
to take care of him and have his children then he said he 
proposed marriage because i thought it would keep her from 
turning me in 
he broke off the engagement a few weeks later but she continued 
to pursue him crawford told the military judge and the 
sevenmember jury 
earlier in the day elmers former housemate yolande 
lamagdeleine testified she told elmer about crawfords test results 
the night after elmer had been with the sailor 
lamagdeleine who said she also had been crawfords lover said 
she said she was going to kill him but minutes earlier 
lamagdeleine testified that elmer did not appear that upset about 
crawfords test results 
she acted not like i did when i found out i was 
hysterical lamagdeleine said 
she said elmer felt crawford owed her something after he 
broke off their brief engagement elmer then decided to file 
charges lamagdeleine said

gen manuel antonio noriega met with 
his florida lawyers tuesday to discuss strategy in seeking 
dismissal of us indictments that charge him with drug trafficking 
noriega engaged lawyers raymond takiff frank rubino and steve 
kollin after the indictments were handed up in february takiff and 
rubino flew to panama monday night 
after the meeting rubino described noriega as very 
encouraged by developments in the case and very confident 
about having weathered us pressure to oust him at the moment 
there are no plans for his retirement rubino said 
the united states is trying to force noriega to resign as 
commander of panamas military and police the position from which 
he controls the civilian government 
washington has applied several types of economic pressure since 
noriega dismissed president eric arturo delvalle on feb 26 the 
day after delvalle tried to fire the general 
according to noriega the reagan administration wants him out 
because of his opposition to what he calls efforts in the united 
states to retain control of the panama canal 
under the 1977 canal treaties the united states must relinquish 
control of the canal by midnight dec 31 1999 
noriega won his first legal battle last month when judge william 
hooveler ruled he did not have to appear in a florida court for 
hearings on his challenge of the indictments 
rubino said the lawyers spent quite a few hours with noriega 
on tuesday told him the good news of our recent court victory 
and discussed our plan of action 
he said he and his colleagues will appear in court in about a 
month to request dismissal of the indictments 
officials initially said the third lawyer kollin was also in

pope john paul ii attacked birth control 
abortion divorce and the local indian practice of concubinage 
tuesday in a mass celebrated 2 miles above sea level in south 
americas poorest country 
facing snowcapped andean peaks soaring to 21000 feet the 
pontiff intoned from a flowerfestooned altar in the native aymara 
dialect dont thieve dont slacken dont lie 
the mass took place in a muddy field near la pazs international 
airport in the suburb of el alto the heights 13150 feet above 
sea level afterward the pope flew to the mountain city of 
cochabamba 150 miles to the southeast to rest for the night 
bolivian police meanwhile said two american men were arrested 
in south africa with explosives a small plane and a flight plan 
that corresponded to part of the popes schedule they said they 
learned of the arrests through an interpol alert and decided to 
tighten security for the pope it was not clear whether the mens 
plans were linked to john pauls trip 
in la paz a searing sun beat down on the huge crowd estimated 
by roman catholic church officials at 300000 but by journalists at 
200000 throughout the mass stretcherbearing red cross volunteers 
carried away people who had fainted from exposure many had been at 
the site since before dawn 
upon arrival at the field john paul greeted groups of the 
elderly the blind and the crippled including a 12yearold polio 
victim named gonzalo who was wearing leg braces church officials 
said gonzalo worked with his father in the jungle crushing coca 
leaves the first step in making cocaine 
john pauls sermon stressed the importance of the family he 
told parents not to flee from family obligations by putting your 
heart in other goals such as work social or political problems 
or worse yet seeking refuge in excessive drinking or other 
degrading habits or in a feminine liberation that does not promote 
women but rather subjugates them even more 
birth control is a falsification of human love the pope 
said he called abortion a serious violation of moral order and 
of human rights 
he urged bolivians not to be seduced by easy recourse to 
divorce which is legal in the south american country abortion 
is illegal but is believed to be commonly practiced 
the pope criticized the centuriesold aymara practice of 
sirvinacuy or living together and having children without 
marrying he said this was contrary to gods wishes and to 
natural law 
some aymaras in the audience were heard to mutter in their 
language i dont understand father the local catholic church 
has largely accepted the practice since most such couples remain 
together for life 
in general the atmosphere was festive near the altar a group of 
aymara indians in bright red ponchos and gaily colored wool hats 
with earflaps played traditional music on windpipes and an 
accordian the crowd cheered and sang songs composed in honor of 
the pontiffs visit 
as he climbed the 25foothigh altar decorated with greenery 
and bouquets of red flowers the pope halted twice to catch his 
breath in the thin air 
it was the highest papal mass ever said vatican officials said 
earlier in the day in an address to diplomats in la paz the 
pope criticized creditor banks for making big profits on loans to 
third world countries mired in debt 
the imbalance between the amount of this debt and the capacity 
to pay it the difference between the sums loaned and the profits 
demanded by creditors is causing very grave damage to many poor 
countries he said 
the abysmal differences between rich and poor countries are 
incompatible with divine designs of a just and equal sharing of the 
goods of creation the pontiff said 
bolivias foreign debt is 42 billion about eight times the 
countrys annual export earnings it is south americas poorest 
country with a minimum wage of about 35 a month 
in cochabamba col freddy cespedes of the national police said 
interpol reported that two men had been arrested in an unspecified 
location in south africa they planned to fly to cochabamba la paz 
and lima peru he said 
we dont know if they were coming because of the pope or for 
drug trafficking cespedes told a news conference 
the pope arrived monday night in bolivia the second stop of a 
13day tour of four south american countries he came from uruguay 
and will leave on saturday for peru and paraguay

drugrelated violence has surged in the inner 
city with seven shootings in four days leaving two men dead 
several others wounded and police pleading for more gun controls 
the city also has been stunned by the recent arrest of a 
12yearold boy who allegedly helped sell cocaine 
police have made several arrests in the shootings and believe 
some of the suspects may be linked to more than one of the 
incidents 
drugs and guns go handinhand said police deputy 
superintendent james woods who directs the citys drug control 
unit drugs are a violent business and guns dont help there are 
just too many guns out there people are going to have to change 
the gun laws 
woods said cocaine appears to be at the center of most of the 
shootings he said crack a potent derivative of cocaine is still 
not as prevalent in boston as in larger cities such as new york and 
los angeles 
things are just coming to a head said georgette watson who 
heads an antidrug tip line in roxbury an economically depressed 
section of the city south of downtown drugs have been plaguing 
the inner city for a long time but now its just exploded and sad 
to say its just the beginning people are very fearful about the 
warm weather 
on friday when two men were seriously wounded by shotgun blasts 
in roxbury police arrested a 12yearold boy in the nearby 
dorchester neighborhood for allegedly working as a runner for a 
cocaine dealer police said the boy had a packet of cocaine in a 
pocket of his sweat pants and told officers lots of kids sell 
drugs 
on saturday night william medina 26 and antonio reis 22 
were shot to death while sitting in a parked car thirty minutes 
later two other men were fired upon on a nearby street but escaped 
unharmed 
whether this is just a blip or a trend its hard to tell 
said police spokesman jim jordan but we know it has to do with 
handguns being a lot more plentiful a lot easier to get 
two suspects arrested in the second saturday night shooting 
philip brown 24 and tony williams 27 are also being 
investigated in connection with the double murder jordan said 
tuesday 
brown and williams pleaded innocent in roxbury district court to 
charges of armed assault with intent to murder each was being held 
tuesday on 100000 cash bail 
police had no suspects in the monday afternoon shooting of jose 
hernandez 19 jordan said hernandez was shot in the head in a 
roxbury parking lot and was listed in critical but stable condition 
tuesday at brigham and womens hospital 
three more men were shot and wounded in separate incidents 
monday evening in roxbury and nearby sections and two 19yearolds 
from roxbury were charged in connection with one of the shootings 
police said 
the rash of violence occurred despite an almost yearlong effort 
by boston polices power patrol a 23officer unit that 
monitors the roxbury area and concentrates on drug locations 
in february 1985 a drug war broke out in roxbury between local 
people and a new york street gang that came to boston to run 
heroin there have been flareups among other gangs seeking to 
control the lucrative traffic but officials said they do not 
believe the latest incidents were gangrelated

the job 14 months ago and running in his first election daub 47 
has represented the omaha area in congress for eight years 
with 40 percent of the vote counted karnes had 23926 votes or 
507 percent and daub had 23248 votes or 493 percent 
the popular kerrey had only token opposition from disbarred 
lawyer ken michaelis and was burying him 39829 votes or 913 
percent to 3807 votes or 87 percent

already has locked up the gop nomination faced no active

karnes who had never before held public office was appointed 
by republican gov kay orr to fill the vacancy created by 
zorinskys death in march 1987 
daub who had wanted the senate appointment himself mounted an 
aggressive campaign against karnes prompting some gop leaders to 
dub him a pit bull 
last week daub charged that karnes was a rubber stamp for 
mrs orr and president reagan karnes said he refused to be drawn 
into negative campaigning and mrs orr said it was sad that 
daub was resorting to desperate tactics 
an omaha worldherald poll taken the week before the primary 
showed 41 percent of those polled preferred karnes while 40 
percent backed daub and the remainder were undecided a lincoln 
journal poll found daub leading karnes by a margin of 42 percent to 
41 percent with 17 percent undecided 
the margin of error in the worldherald poll was 4 percentage 
points and 64 percentage points in the journal polls 
kerrey 44 was elected governor in 1982 in his first bid for 
elective office he chose not to run in 1986 
the last senator defeated in a primary was richard stone a 
florida democrat who lost in an oct 7 1980 runoff to democrat

former gov richard b ogilvie who ushered in 
the state income tax and may have paid for it by losing his 
reelection bid in 1972 died tuesday a day after a massive heart 
attack and emergency bypass surgery 
the 65yearold republican suffered irreparable damage to his 
heart said officials at northwestern memorial hospital where 
ogilvie was taken after he was stricken at his downtown law office 
monday 
ogilvie never regained consciousness after a second cardiac 
arrest and a quadruple bypass operation the hospital said his 
wife dorothy and his daughter elizabeth were at the hospital 
when he died 
he always spoke his mind and had the strength of character to 
stand behind issues he believed in such as the states first 
income tax gov james r thompson said tuesday 
dick ogilvie has been a superior and courageous public servant 
by any standard said sen paul simon dill who served as 
ogilvies lieutenant governor many thought we would not get 
along but we had a remarkably good working relationship 
ogilvie a republican was elected governor in 1968 and served 
until 1973 when he was succeeded by democrat dan walker who had 
won with 51 percent of the vote 
his narrow reelection loss to walker was attributed in part to 
the 1969 enactment of the states first income tax which ogilvie 
listed among his accomplishments 
ogilvie a former federal prosecutor made a fast rise in 
chicago politics 
in 1962 he defeated thenmayor richard j daleys candidate for 
sheriff and in 1966 was elected president of the cook county board 
ogilvie ran for governor in 1968 overwhelming peoria 
industrialist john henry altorfer in the gop primary and then 
defeating democratic incumbent sam shapiro with 512 percent of the 
vote in the general election 
ogilvies supporters have said his accomplishments included a 
major highway construction program and upgraded public health 
penal and lawenforcement systems critics said the road program 
was riddled with politics 
in recent years ogilvie won praise for his handling of the 
milwaukee road bankruptcy considered one of the most successful 
rail bankruptcy reorganizations he was named trustee of the 
chicago missouri amp western railway co which has been under 
federal bankruptcy reorganization since april 
mayor eugene sawyer had been preparing to name ogilvie chairman 
of the chicago housing authority the citys troubled public 
housing agency 
governments are constantly seeking him to solve insurmountable 
problems cook county county commissioner harold tyrrell said 
monday after hearing of ogilvies heart attack when you got to 
the point where it seemed insurmountable you called for dick 
in 1958 he left corporate law to head a special us justice 
department crimefighting unit in chicago where he won a 
conviction of mob leader tony accardo on income taxevasion charges 
the conviction was reversed by a federal appeals court which 
held that publicity might have biased the jurors 
after the 1972 election ogilvie joined the law firm of isham 
lincoln amp beale where he was working monday 
ogilvie was chairman of gerald fords illinois presidential 
campaign in 1976 when ford defeated ronald reagan in the states 
primary and then carried the state in the general election

george bushs defense on his two biggest 
campaign liabilities the irancontra affair and alleged drug 
dealing by panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega is the same a 
plea of ignorance 
on both counts the republican presidential candidate sounds 
alike 
although he once headed the central intelligence agency and a 
presidential task force on drugs he says he didnt know noriega 
was involved in alleged drug trafficking until this past february 
when a us indictment was handed down in florida 
even though a member of the national security council he says 
he had no hint that us arms were being sold to iran in an effort 
to free hostages or that proceeds were funnelled illegally to the 
contras in nicaragua 
the vice presidents continued denial of advance knowledge in 
both instances has hung over his campaign like a twoedged sword 
either he knew more than hes admitting in which case hes not 
telling the truth or the candidate who claims vast experience in 
foreign policy was kept in the dark on two matters of crucial 
international importance

be able to clear up differences over a missileban treaty with the

passengers up to twice as far as the european concorde said the 
report issued by the national aeronautics and space administration 
the concorde has a range of 3350 miles 
growth in transpacific air travel would justify designing and

video mania is gripping eastern europe 
brought on by a booming black market in vcrs and a desire of 
millions to see movies banned in statecontrolled theaters 
clearly worried the communist governments are going on the 
attack against them but at the same time they are trying to corner 
some of the lucrative market 
in poland some roman catholic parishes organize video showings 
of religious and dissident films and they draw large audiences 
any hungarian can get a fill of gutwrenching violence group 
sex antisoviet sentiment and other east bloc taboos 
a newspaper in romania shocked readers recently with the account 
of a rapist who lured a victim to his home by offering to show her 
sylvester stallone in rambo 
video is a powerful weapon the czechoslovak communist party 
daily rude pravo said recently 
video must no longer pass unnoticed complained the polish 
weekly politika its scale has become far too big the video 
market has managed to escape any control by the state and perhaps 
this is the reason why it is flourishing 
according to semiofficial estimates at least 2 million video 
recorders have made their way into the six soviet bloc countries 
which have a total population of about 110 million 
the scarcity of video recorders and the lure of the independent 
entertainment they offer means millions of east europeans are 
hunting for vcrs 
east europeans who travel to the west often buy vcrs for 
themselves or to sell on the black market back home where they 
fetch many times their western price 
in romania and bulgaria for example an inexpensive western vcr 
can cost the equivalent on the black market of 4500 15 times 
the average monthly salary 
in east germany hungary poland and czechoslovakia vcrs are 
available in special hardcurrency stores with prices ranging from 
400 in poland to 1200 in east germany 
its a lot of money but its the best entertainment weve got 
and a kind of escape from the daily fare of stateowned culture 
said a doctor in romania where the state television is on the air 
just two hours a day on weekdays 
like other east europeans with friends or relatives in the west 
the doctor paid a hefty customs duty 700 to get a japanese vcr 
sent by his sister in west germany 
the demand matches the high prices 
in bucharest the classifiedad pages of the government 
newspaper romania libera are devoted almost exclusively to offers 
to buy or sell videos 
in poland public video showings have moved from xrated films 
like emmanuelle caligula and 120 days of sodom to 
regular shows in cultural centers in housing projects or villages 
that have no movie theaters 
the polish underground publishing house nowa has released at 
least 12 video cassettes including the american movies moscow on 
the hudson and sophies choice 
it also has distributed banned polish films such as ryszard 
bugajskis przesluchania the interrogation which is about a 
woman imprisoned in the stalinist era 
some catholic parishes in poland have vcrs which they use for 
public showings of religious and other films a church in bialystok 
had an easter showing of yentl the barbra streisand movie 
about jews in poland 
the polish underground publication video narcomania estimated 
last year that more than 70 percent of video cassettes in poland 
are pure escapism pornography science fiction horror movies 
other thrillers and comedies 
that pattern holds across the bloc where the most popular 
movies are western boxoffice hits like top gun or platoon 
recordings of american television series like dallas and 
dynasty are also wellliked as is soft porn and anticommunist 
films such as rambo ii and rocky iv 
apparently trying to channel popular interest toward less 
noxious themes czechoslovakias rude pravo assailed the popular 
taste in videos 
video programs on the black market are creations exploiting 
the lowest instincts of sexuality and inhuman violence it said 
vcr owners admire low quality movies full of blood until late at 
night in copies that are hard to watch 
throughout the bloc people can watch up to four badly copied 
movies a night at private video parties 
in romania a western a porno movie and a cup of coffee costs 
16 almost 20 times more than a ticket to a state movie theater 
official efforts seem unlikely to stop the video craze anytime 
soon and communist governments have taken some steps to get in on 
the profits 
in czechoslovakia a joint venture has been established using 
components and knowhow from the dutch company philips to produce 
100000 vcrs a year 
throughout eastern europe authorities have produced 
ideologically acceptable movies for the vcr set up rental services 
and levied steep fees on imported material 
repression is also used more than 100 semiofficial rental shops 
in poland are now being liquidated under a 1987 law tightening 
control on the video market 
in lodz some private polish videolibrary owners face trial on 
charges of piracy and one case has been reported of a vcr owner 
having his machine confiscated for screening porno

is it le grand pooton or an actual fact 
item if diluted thinly enough the juice of one lemon would 
cover the entire state of oregon 
item the food spilled from tacos in a single afternoon would 
fill the shoes of everyone in norway 
as it turns out both items are actual facts cully abrell 
and john thompson have compiled in their new book moses may have 
been an apache and other actual facts a tongueincheek tome 
that just may be the next best thing to chopped liver this summer 
the main street press of pittstown nj has issued 50000 
copies of their new book moses may have been an apache and other 
actual facts the waldenbooks chain bought 15000 
each pair of handlettered facts in the book is accompanied 
by drawings reminiscent of robert ripleys believe it or not 
panels thompson produced the black ink artwork and wrote the text 
with abrell they call the book le grand pooton not to be 
confused with la petite crouton 
in england they would simply be called eccentrics said 
their publisher martin grife in america they might be called 
nut cases i think they are far saner than we are though they 
definitely are characters 
grife describes the book as humor for the intelligent reader 
you have to have some knowledge about the world to understand 
whats funny about actual facts he said and if you dont 
think theyre cleverly written try dropping or changing a word or 
two 
abrell and thompson arent very forthcoming when asked to 
explain the genesis of individual entries 
because of recent findings in a dig near tucson 
archaeologists now believe moses to have been an apache the book 
says 
they both wandered the desert didnt they abrell said 
if placed inside president taft president wilson would have 
stuck out a total of 18 inches the book says 
statistics taken to their ultimate extreme notes thompson 
the recurring themes in the book include musk oxen snakes 
presidents potatoes and grosvenor utah 
with a good actual fact theres a certain irritant value 
abrell said acknowledging people have divergent reactions some 
fall on the floor laughing and some sit as if youre speaking 
lithuanian 
abrell 60 lists 40 some occupations on his resume ranging 
from bartender to north woods guide to lifeguard he taught drama 
at wichitas friends university for 19 years before retiring in 
1982 when declining enrollment money and facility problems forced 
the elimination of his department 
thompson 36 is a former student of abrells who sometimes 
works as a freelance artist 
unlike mr abrell however mr thompson has never really 
gotten started at anything and now seems pretty much to have given 
up he has a degree in art his actual facts biography says 
the two live in an old farmhouse on a 16acre plot much of 
which was reclaimed from wheat fields a huge barn is being 
remodeled into new living quarters outbuildings bulge with the 
fruits of frequent garage sale trips about 60 chickens and five 
confident roosters roam the grounds 
the abrellthompson phone is listed under a fake american indian 
name 
during a recent interview abrell slipped frequently into an 
irish accent he attributed the lapses to his mixed ancestry 
rather than the rum apricot brandy and sangria he had been 
consuming to soothe a sore throat the reclusive thompson spent 
much of the interview looking at newspaper advertisements for lawn 
mowers 
abrell said a sampler of actual facts was shipped off to 
five publishers with a note is there a market for more of 
these 
we got back one rejection slip we got back another that said 
we only deal through agents we havent yet heard from the other 
two abrell said 
and martin wrote us a letter that said yes yes yes yes 
yes thompson said 
the two balk at the idea of a book promotion tour booksigning 
parties or telephone interviews on radio talk shows but abrell 
uses his best stage voice and draws on his carnival days when 
talking up the tome 
in this age of trivial pursuit this is the archetypal 
ultimate not penultimate compendium of knowledge he said 
i dont think any household should be without one particularly 
if there is a child in school or if one of the parents has ever 
gone to school or if theyve known anyone who can spell the word 
school

an alabama martini is a 
powerhouse concoction that includes neither gin nor vermouth its 
principal ingredients involve beer a large funnel and a 2foot 
length of plastic hose 
get the idea if not ila waite a bemused local observer will 
be happy to spell it out 
they pour the beer into the funnel stick the hose in their 
mouths and swallow the contents in a single gulp she said 
sitting at a beachfront bar in this florida panhandle town its 
a very popular drink on saturday nights when the fellows from 
southern georgia and la thats lower alabama come down here 
to party 
welcome to the redneck riveria as the lyrics of a popular local 
song explain it aint no monte carlo it aint no vegas night 
its cutoff jeans and bikini queens and a slice of dixie delight 
but in the decade since singersong writer madison shine 
powell first captured the special southernfried ambience along 130 
miles of sugarfine white sand and sparkling blue water stretching 
from panama city beach to gulf shores ala much has changed 
highrise condominiums now draw hordes of tourists to the gulf 
of mexico beaches fancy restaurants and gleaming hotels rise amid 
the seedy bars tacky motels water slides tshirt shops and 
miniature golf courses 
as a result the term redneck riveria one of endearment to 
powell and many other longtime residents has become taboo among 
local politicians and chamber of commerce types 
the gulf shores city council at one point considered outlawing 
use of the term inside city limits but was advised such a ban would 
be unconstitutional 
we did have that redneck label several years ago but it really 
doesnt fit us anymore said judy norris a gulf shores chamber 
of commerce official we now have all the latest conveniences and 
most modern vacation accommodations 
norris said the community now prefers to be called the 
american rivieria 
whatever the tag spring break and summer vacation revive the 
raucous nightlife in gulf shores and panama city beach the polar 
hot spots of the redneck riviera 
saturday night is really something to see this time of year 
when the pickup trucks and customized cars are backed up bumper to 
bumper along the beach highway said waite a special education 
teacher who moved to the gulf coast five years ago from lansing 
mich 
the good ol boys sit in their trucks waving their confederate 
flags out the windows and drinking alabama martinis then after a 
big gulp they let out a belch and a rebel yell 
julie binford owner of the euphoria lounge where waite was 
holding forth laughed as she picked up the conversation 
the traffic gets so thick that they can jump out of their 
trucks and come in for a restroom stop and a beer and when they go 
back outside the truck theyre riding in wont have moved more 
than 30 feet said binford a transplanted oregonian who said she 
used to keep a dictionary behind the bar to help her customers with 
the meaning of euphoria 
its those yells that i find funny said waite we call 
them mating calls the boys will see some girls and scream 
yahoo and the girls will answer back eehha 
the nights become more serene as one heads west out of panama 
city beach to beachside communities such as destin and fort walton 
as the honky tonks grow fewer the shore still sprouts highrise 
condos including a towering 21story affair in the village of 
seagrove halfway between panama city beach and pensacola 
until recently gulf coast developers could build more or less 
where they chose but lawsuits brought by environmental groups and 
a deflated real estate market have brought more stringent landuse 
codes and a slowdown in development 
despite the development its the areas natural charms which 
include some of the whitest beaches and clearest water in north 
america that make it so popular with rednecks and northerners 
alike 
squadrons of pelicans flying in tight formation patrol the 
beach hordes of quickstepping sandpipers skip along the 
waterline and dolphins frolic a few feet offshore 
on the rivieras western end the state border is marked by the 
florabama bar a sprawling establishment of wood and brick located 
just a few feet inside the florida line which allows it to open 
sundays the bar signals reentry to redneck territory 
if youre lookin for the redneck riviera this is it said 
buddy wells a bearded bartender at the florabama where one famous 
good ol boy former pro football quarterback kenny the snake 
stabler sometimes stops by to pass the time 
stabler who lives at nearby ono island wasnt in residence 
this day but ron lacy a sunburned construction worker 
volunteered that the snake has retained his redneck ways 
us alabamians dont mind admitting were rednecks lacy 
said but some floridians especially those folks over around 
pensacola why it nearly kills them to admit it 
yet even shine powell a marine biologist when hes not singing 
in honky tonks acknowledges the areas nightlife has toned down 
since 1979 when hurricane frederick wiped out most of the bars 
beach cottages and fishing shacks along the shore and set the stage 
for the onslaught of condos 
i know that the council and chamber of commerce would dearly 
like to promote this area as a retirement haven powell said 
but frankly i liked it better when there was nothing here but 
little ol beach cottages and laidback barefoot bars 
vance jannings who drove down to gulf shores with a bunch of 
buddies from the mobile area said no matter what its called the 
beach is still the best party spot he knows of 
we come down here every chance we get said jannings who 
was drinking beer beside the beach in a black pickup truck 
just then a couple of young bikiniclad women drove past in a 
dune buggy setting off a chorus of yahoos from jannings and 
his crew eehha replied the women and the pickup roared off 
down highway in hot pursuit doing what comes naturally on the 
redneck riviera

violence and intimidation traditional 
sources of power behind bars have declined in a maximumsecurity 
prison here since officials began using a simple kind of leverage 
long known to parents of unruly children threatening to turn off 
the tv 
drug use too has lessened among the 800 inmates at wende 
correctional facility 
its become a very effective sanction said prison director 
dominic mantello all we have to do is threaten to take it away 
two years ago the wende inmates voted unanimously to give up 
their right to receive packages from the outside in exchange for 
the option to buy personal television sets for their cells 
the program was originally designed to stop most drugs coming 
into the prison but authorities quickly noticed another benefit 
they know if they act up theyll lose their tv privileges 
said robert mcclellen deputy superintendent for security at wende 
now they walk away from most fights and turn their backs on 
trouble 
most state and federal prisons along with local jails have 
television sets inmates can watch in groups during recreational 
periods some allow inmates to have personal televisions but very 
few have programs like wendes according to george kamp president 
of criminal justice institute a new yorkbased corrections 
consulting firm 
in the beginning mantello said he was suspicious of the idea 
thinking it would be viewed from the outside as coddling 
criminals 
lets face it these people were sent here to be punished 
he said 
what convinced mantello was the improvement in security at the 
prison 
instead of gathering in unmanagable groups at recreation time 
inmates stay in their cells which is the safest place for them and 
their guards he said 
i feel safer here than walking the streets in some parts of 
buffalo mantello said the prison is about 30 miles west of 
buffalo in the farming town of alden 
as mantello walks through the cell blocks inmates nod and greet 
him with hello sir 
this is unlike any other max joint said an inmate who 
serves on the inmate liaison committee you can walk around 
without worrying about taking one in the back 
i know guys who transferred here who give a massive sigh of 
relief said the inmate who asked not to be identified because 
he didnt want to advertise the fact that he was behind bars 
again 
the program was the result of a meeting between state 
corrections commissioner thomas coughlin and the members of the 
inmate committee 
the inmates had suggested the idea arguing that personal 
televisions would put an end to the sometimes violent arguments 
that arise when groups of inmates try to decide what program to 
watch 
coughlin agreed but set two requirements first he wanted the 
inmates to limit their right to receive packages 
packages sent to inmates from family and friends were a major 
source of contraband although packages are searched officials 
said some drugs and weapons get through because of ingenious 
methods of concealment and because so many packages are sent 
particularly at holidays 
coughlins second requirement was that prisoners adopt the swap 
unanimously 
coughlin put the same proposition to inmates in the states 11 
other maximumsecurity prisons but only wende approved 
more than 400 inmates have paid 55 for 12inch blackandwhite 
sets with headphones from the prison commissary 
inmates earn the money working in the prison top scale is about 
150 per day 
im not naive enough to think theres no drugs mantello 
said but the inmates and staff are comfortable with each other 
i dont have inmates ripping each other off for drugs i have a 
safer environment 
an average 58 inmates per 1000 at the other maximumsecurity 
prisons are found in possession of drugs state figures show the 
rate is roughly half that at wende 30 per 1000 
last year 23000 inmates at 43 state prisons facilities 
underwent random urinalysis testing six percent tested positive 
statewide only 2 percent tested positive at wende 
its totally different from any other facility said deputy 
superintendent mcclellen who formerly worked at the nearby attica 
correctional facility the site of the 1971 riot that killed 43 
people 
mcclellen said the biggest complaint from the wende inmates was 
getting too few channels 
the inmates can generally get six channels from buffalo and 
rochester stations via an antenna on the roof of the prison 
however reception is not clear in some parts of the building and 
officials are exploring other options mantello said a cable hookup 
would be too expensive 
we are not in the business of trying to please them he 
said but we must be doing something right if thats their 
biggest complaint

the economists performed as expected when the 
stock market crashed in october sagely warning that a consumerled 
recession would follow it didnt 
recognizing that their script might be wrong the economists 
changed it a couple of months later they delayed their projected 
recession to mid1988 and some daringly even to late 1988 
the consensus became even more widely split however when some 
continued to talk of imminent recession they would not be put off 
any more than the recession would be put off but the old rationale 
wouldnt work anymore 
recognizing that the consumer hadnt been frightened from the 
marketplace the newly adopted reasoning was that an accumulation 
of inventories unsold goods would stagnate the economy and 
pitch it forward on its face 
the inventoryled recession didnt happen either but this did 
not faze the pessimists they found a new approach instead of 
going directly into recession they said the economy would first 
overheat 
that is there would be a boom of sorts before the recession to 
most people a boom is the opposite of a bust which is a recession 
but somehow the economic seers accomplished the turnabout without 
any public apology 
they are a creative bunch says one economist edward 
yardeni of prudentialbache securities he thinks they have done it 
again he believes they are reacting to the past and present rather 
than reading the future 
it is ironic he said last week that the pessimistic 
crowd sees a boom just as bloated inventories are starting to cool 
things off he thinks many of his colleagues will be forced to 
flipflop again 
while you might marvel at this agility its consequences cannot 
be laughed off 
explaining why he wrote the book economists at bay why the 
experts will never solve your problems robert lekachman 
explained that when respectable economists are wrong en masse 
other people usually suffer the consequences 
lekachman wrote his book in the 1970s after watching his 
colleagues provide the white house with such poor advice that the 
consequences are felt to this day 
example in early 1973 economists encouraged president nixon to 
dismantle a comparatively effective set of wage and price controls 
as a group they failed to see the price explosion that followed 
at no point were the economists either prescient or helpful 
wrote lekachman 
when gerald ford succeeded nixon he summoned economists to a 
conference in september 1974 none of those assembled warned of 
the collapse of production and employment which began almost as 
soon as they left town 
the advice caused ford to launch a program aimed at beating 
inflation instead of spurring the economy recession was the 
problem the president was advised to fight its opposite a boom 
lekachman asserted that conventional economics would continue to 
mislead politicians and the public until economists surrendered the 
delusion that they are pure scientists 
have they will they any answers are as debatable as economics 
itself but some recent evidence suggests that if economics is a 
science it is very inexact 
example an economist who views with curiousity and perhaps 
astonishment the herd mentality of colleagues to forecast an overly 
strong economy based on the latest monthly employment and jobless 
statistics 
says albert h cox jr employment is not a leading 
indicator it is a coincident indicator as such it tell us only 
where we have been not where were going 
example a policy paper from the us chamber of commerce 
stating that the latest consumer price statistics on which hinge 
many of the latest forecasts of rising inflation are being misread 
it refers to the widespread assumption that inflation is 
worsening based on a sharp increase during one month march 
what should be noted instead the chamber contends is that in 
the januarymarch quarter the inflation rate fell in the chambers 
view the threat of inflation on which policy is being based is 
overstated 
could it mean another flipflop it certainly could

heartache ungrieved has gnawed at charlotte 
mitnik for 36 years her brother is among the legion of the lost 
one of 8177 american soldiers unaccounted for in the korean war 
its unfinished business said mrs mitnik 54 of 
huntingdon valley pa her brother maj samuel busch vanished 
friday june 13 1952 on a weather reconnaissance flight 
i just want the truth i want the end of the story she 
said if he were dead and we had the remains he would be home 
he would have his resting place for now the pain is always 
there 
these days few people dredge up the agony of korea because the 
memory of mias in vietnam is fresher 
yet a comparison of casualties is heartbreakingly revealing in 
korea 54246 americans died in three years fighting an undeclared 
war involving 16 united nations countries against north korea and 
china and more than 8000 men were missing or taken prisoner in 
vietnam where us involvement spanned 16 years 58156 soldiers 
were killed and 2204 remain unaccounted for 
since the end of hostilities the remains of 179 soldiers have 
been returned from southeast asia none have been returned from 
korea since 1954 
a breakthrough in korea is sought this year the 35th 
anniversary of the armistice because the south is host of the 
summer olympic games which will focus international attention on 
the peninsula and its people north korea has demanded a role as 
cohost and threatens to otherwise keep its team away from the 
games in which 13000 athletes from 161 nations will compete where 
battles once raged 
the war is technically still on although a 1953 ceasefire 
stopped the fighting the opposing sides meet each year through the 
military armistice commission at panmunjom to enforce the armistice 
and discuss such issues as mias 
of the 8177 mias in korea the pentagon still lists 389 as 
prisoners of war soldiers known to be in communist prison camps 
at the ceasefire but who were not repatriated all were eventually 
presumed dead to settle insurance and death benefits 
bodies are supposed to be returned if they are found each year 
the united states has asked in vain for its mias and pows north 
korea always insisted it had no bodies until last year 
on nov 25 the north said it had the bodies of jack j saunders 
of cedar city utah and arthur l seaton of philadelphia but 
international terrorism cruelly blocked their return 
two days after the mia announcement korean air lines flight 858 
disappeared over the andaman sea near burma with 115 people aboard 
a north korean woman confessed shed planted a bomb on orders from 
a north korean official to scare countries away from the olympics 
the united states put north korea on its list of countries that 
support terrorism and banned north koreans from the country the 
north retaliated by refusing to turn over the bodies 
north korea slammed the door in our face they shot us down 
said us rep john rowland rconn who went to korea in hopes of 
bringing the bodies home in january until they see political 
advantage in turning over remains theyre not going to 
rowland 30 a member of the house armed services committee and 
the veterans committee also rapped the governments overall 
handling of mias in korea 
we left them there to rot rowland said 
government officials bristle at such criticism the return of 
mias was discussed 77 times from 1955 to 1957 at the geneva 
conference the defense department said and is brought up every 
year at panmunjom 
in 1986 the united states gave north korea a fat file of maps 
and charts on 13 former pow camps one former pow hospital known to 
have burial sites 291 crash sites known to involve 301 people and 
seven un burial sites containing the remains of 288 allied 
servicemen 
last july the united states offered to send a multinational 
search team into the north to find bodies 
every approach has either been rebuffed or accepted without 
response its been a oneway street said lt col keith 
schneider spokesman for the defense department 
its extremely frustrating totally bewildering and totally 
inhumane to acknowledge you have them acknowledge the 
responsibility to return them and then do nothing schneider said 
of the refusal to turn over the bodies 
on the possibility of living pows schneider said we have no 
reason to believe there are americans still alive and being held 
muddling the korean issue is how the countries deal with each 
other north korea one of the worlds most closed societies wants 
to deal directly with the united states rather than go through the 
mac 
but the united states which hasnt had relations with the north 
since 1948 insists that the soviet union and china first recognize 
south korea 
we have a nervous ally in south korea said a korean expert 
with the state department who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the last thing they need is for us to get into bed with their 
mortal enemy disrupting a major alliance is too steep a price to 
pay simply to get some remains 
but the missing men are more than some remains to korean 
veterans 
i couldnt believe our government had forsaken all these 
people its a national disgrace said frank kerr a former 
combat marine and president of the chosin few an organization of 
3200 korean war veterans who fought in the epic battle of chosin 
reservoir 
they truly are the forgotten people of a forgotten war said 
thomas gregory who heads the groups efforts to reclaim bodies 
they were shoved aside because we had other priorities nobody 
cared about the mias its a shame we have let it linger on 
north korea has discussed mias with members of the chosin few 
nine times since 1985 through its mission in new york city the 
last time on nov 11 1987 when caskets and transport for the two 
bodies were discussed 
we were on the verge of a breakthrough kerr said 
the north talked to the veterans group even though it lacks 
political relations with the united states 
we are very much willing to solve the question on a 
humanitarian basis the us government is not willing to 
cooperate they are blocking our efforts said pak gil yon 
united nations observer for north korea 
for catherine kirkland finding her brother is more important 
than the intracacies of global diplomacy she has a headstone and 
gravesite in jacksonville beach fla for her brother phillip 
hammond who disappeared in the chosin battle dec 6 1950 
hes an american he belongs here he fought for his country 
he should have the privilege of being brought home mrs kirkland 
said in a telephone interview sobbing anew 
billi zippwold 39 of santa ana calif clings to memories of 
her father through grainy home movies old flight logs service 
medals and a marker at arlington national cemetery his jet 
disappeared nov 30 1950 at the chosin reservoir 
ill probably spend the rest of my life wondering mrs 
zippwold said i want him home if hes dead i want to give him 
the burial he deserves id like to put an end to it so theres no 
more haunting about what happened

robert dumas is an unlikely rambo a 
tenacious rawboned connecticut yankee he has singlehandedly 
crusaded for 37 years to free a brother he thinks is still captive 
in north korea 
i will not stop until i bring him home or i find out what 
happened to him said dumas 58 i never accepted he was dead 
i have a will that wont be broken if i was in his shoes wouldnt 
i want my country to come get me 
roger dumas an army machine gunner is one of 389 american 
soldiers still listed as pows among the 8177 missing in action in 
korea the pentagon and north korea deny any are alive but that 
hasnt stopped his brother 
dumas vanished in battle nov 4 1950 and was listed as an mia 
that nov 29 he was presumed dead feb 26 1954 but never 
accounted for 
robert joined the army and went to korea in 1951 in a vain 
search for his younger brother a buddy mailed his letters home 
from austria so his mother wouldnt worry about losing another son 
through the years mrs dumas clung to the hope the youngest of 
her seven children had not been killed and she said on her 
deathbed in 1959 hes alive robert dumas vowed hed find him 
rambo is a musclebound piece of hollywood hokum who storms into 
vietnam to free american prisoners of war dumas private war is 
more subdued but no less valorous 
in his quixotic search dumas a retired state employee on a 
disability pension since 1973 has mortgaged his house three times 
taken one vacation in 31 years and filled his basement to the 
ceiling with papers files casette tapes and dogeared documents 
i cant let go of it dumas said everywhere i go im 
reminded of it how can that many guys disappear in an area the 
size of rhode island and connecticut 
dumas won a federal court trial in 1984 to force the army to 
reclassify his brother from mia to pow his brother is still 
presumed dead however 
dumas produced three witnesses who said they had seen his 
brother in north koreas camp 5 before they were freed in 1953 
the change in status may seem bureaucratic but dumas hailed it 
as a breakthrough 
the army now admits hes a pow if hes a pow then where is 
he they have to go get him dumas said 
what he has left of roger are black and white photos service 
medals and childhood memories of making sure his kid brother made 
the 830 pm household curfew 
some of dumas hope hinges on faint evidence and vague sightings 
walter embom of seattle wash phoned dumas in 1979 to say hed 
been a pow in camp 5 embom also said he was recaptured in 1956 
while on patrol of the demilitarized zone in his second captivity 
embom said he had seen roger dumas and 39 other americans 
but the government challenged emboms credibility saying he was 
never a prisoner either in the war or in 1956 
morning roll call reports show him present daily through his 
11month tour of duty in south korea according to a 1980 
memorandum from the house armed services investigation subcommittee 
all of the information supplied by embom must be rejected as 
it has no basis in fact according to the panels staff 
memorandum 
serban oprica a romanian businessman who now lives in 
bloomfield conn told dumas he saw 50 americans working in a 
cabbage field in north korea in 1980 giving dumas hope his brother 
might still be one of them 
if i die and nothing happens at least i tried dumas said 
this is all i ever focused on i am a driven man

the average cost of attending private 
universities is up 81 percent to 11870 a year from 1980 for 
public universities the total of tuition fees room and board has 
increased 61 percent to about 4370 the cost at some selective 
private schools this fall will approach 20000 
such numbers are painfully clear this spring to prospective 
freshmen and their parents who fresh from the euphoria of mailed 
acceptances now face the hard part how to pay 
help exists for most families a federal study this month found 
that 58 percent of fulltime undergraduates receive financial aid 
from federal and state government or from colleges themselves aid 
per student averages 3813 
but college aid officials report widespread confusion about who 
is eligible for such aid familiar rules about tuition and how to 
pay it have given way to myths and misconceptions here are some of 
the most common with comments to help set the record straight 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
myth 1 it doesnt pay to save for college if you do the 
school just takes your savings if you dont the college will 
rescue you with financial aid 
thats just a screwy way to plan for the future said 
kathleen brouder director of information of the college 
scholarship service of the college board 
brouder and other college officials say the myth shows a 
misunderstanding of the congressionally mandated formula colleges 
use to estimate how much aid a student can expect contrary to what 
many families believe the formula weighs income more heavily than 
assets and savings in calculating a familys expected contribution 
to illustrate parents with two children a 40000 annual 
income and 20000 in assets would ordinarily be expected to 
contribute 4616 per year if that family had 20000 more in 
savings their expected contribution would increase only slightly 
to 4864 but if their annual income went up the same 20000 
their expected contribution would more than double to 10384 
in a different respect however the myth contains a germ of 
truth 
families who put aside assets in their childrens names may gain 
tax advantages but miss out on grants and loans this is because 
the aid formula entitles colleges to count 35 percent of such 
custodial accounts as part of the familys annual contribution 
combined with parental payments a familys contribution could be 
too high to qualify for aid 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
myth 2 the higher the tuition the better the school 
educators have lately dubbed this the chivas regal 
mentality it holds that schools that charge the most educate the 
best and those with lower tuitions must be inferior 
as any guidance counselor knows scores of schools among the 
more than 3000 us institutions of higher learning charge 
relatively low tuitions but provide top educations alongside the 
many state universities that fill that description are such private 
schools as albion college in michigan millsaps college in 
mississippi loras college in iowa and centre college in kentucky 
nevertheless the most expensive schools continue to attract the 
most applicants harvard for example this year received 14430 
applications for 2147 freshman places 
some colleges mt holyoke for example openly admit they wont 
drop tuitions much below their competitors because they fear 
applicants will think their quality is slipping

myth 3 federal student aid has plunged in the reagan years 
true government aid is down in 1987 aid from government and 
private sources totaled 205 billion up 21 percent from 1980 but 
down 6 percent when adjusted for inflation 
and new rules have made it harder to qualify with candidates 
required to demonstrate financial need 
but the biggest change in the financial aid picture occurred 
before reagan was elected starting in the mid1970s the 
proportion of all student aid in the form of loans grew from 
onefifth to onehalf that has meant students and parents are 
assuming more college debts than ever 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
myth 4 i cant afford the most selective schools 
perhaps no one hears this more often than joan goodrich 
financial aid director of bennington college in vermont where 
annual costs in september will reach 19990 the nations highest 
more than half of benningtons students receive college grants 
averaging 9000 per student combined with workstudy aid and 
government loans goodrich said the grants make that 20000 bill 
closer to 9000 
thats small comfort to many middleclass students for whom 
9000 is still a hefty even prohibitive sum but for poorer 
students colleges who want diverse student bodies will pick up 
most of the tab it is thus conceivable that a bennington could 
wind up no more expensive than a state college if a student can 
prove need 
furthermore wellendowed colleges tend to use the financial aid 
formula as the starting point for calculating a familys need aid 
officers exercise professional discretion in judging what each 
family can afford

myth 5 why bother applying for financial aid i probably 
dont qualify 
this encompasses a whole family of myths each reflecting 
misunderstanding of how much help the poor the middle class and 
the wealthy believe is available 
middleclass parents commonly complain poor kids always get 
taken care of 
not always theres no question that the lower a familys 
income the less it is expected to contribute according to the 
formula a family of four with a 20000 income would be expected 
to contribute 398 a year while the figure for a family with a 
40000 income would be 4616 
still middleclass families enjoy many more options than most 
poor families while the poor student with extraordinary athletic 
or academic ability might win a scholarship to a school with a 
hefty endowment the one with more average talents finds precious 
few schools willing to absorb enough of the tuition to make 
attendance affordable 
conversely aid officers meet many families these days who 
wrongly believe were too rich to apply 
we have a family of four with an income of 70000 with two 
kids in college said alicia reyes director of college aid at 
the university of chicago which will charge an estimated 19000 
for tuition fees room and board next fall 
for their kid attending our school the parental contribution 
will be 7000 she said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
myth 6 you can work your way through school 
i have a lot of parents who come to me and say i worked my 
way through and that is what my kid should do said barbara 
lutz director of student employment at the university of texas at 
arlington 
at the low wages most students can expect between classes or 
during summers off its absurd for parents to imagine their 
children can contribute more than a fraction of college costs 
federally subsidized work programs make up just 37 percent of 
total college aid down from a little over 5 percent in 197071 a 
student in the program who works the average 12 hours a week at 
minimum wage might earn 6 percent of an annual college bill 
that doesnt mean a job is a bad idea a 1987 study released by 
the higher education coordinating board in olympia wash examined 
3600 student records and found that those who worked outperformed 
those who didnt undergraduates who worked 1020 hours a week got 
better grades than those who worked fewer than 10 hours or more 
than 20 hours

lured by the warm promise of california the 
three remaining presidential candidates are being drawn into a 
monthlong primary campaign that is as much a preview of the fall 
campaign as a final nomination battleground 
jesse jackson trailing for the democratic nomination and 
michael dukakis the frontrunner have already made initial forays 
into the state as has george bush whose republican nomination is 
assured 
each has a little different goal in mind in the state that has 
been reliably republican in 20 years of presidential elections but 
may not be so this year 
jesses going to be looking toward june 7 but dukakis and 
bush are going to be taking this time now to work toward 
november said steven teichner a polltaker based in orange 
county calif 
for jackson california offers the last chance to score an upset 
over dukakis an outcome that would strengthen jacksons influence 
at the democratic national convention but likely would not be 
enough to derail the massachusetts governors drive to the 
nomination 
the challenge for dukakis is to avoid the pitfalls of 
californias contrary nature the state has rejected the eventual 
democratic nominee in the last three primary elections and at the 
same time to lay the groundwork for the fall campaign in a state 
that may be crucial in putting together an electoral majority 
and for bush the job is to keep the democrats from grabbing all 
the attention to generate some excitement for himself and to 
attempt to close the gap in polls that show him trailing dukakis by 
10 percentage points among california voters 
jackson has promised to spend more than three full weeks 
campaigning for californias 314 democratic delegates dukakis 
plans to spend 10 days to two weeks spread over several weeks 
bush aides expect him to log a minimum of eight or nine days here 
even though he has no real competition and the nomination in his 
pocket 
it will mean more candidate attention than california has been 
accustomed to seeing given a primary date that falls too late to 
have a real role in deciding the nominee in most recent years 
teichner said 
weve never had candidates spend as much time as these guys 
are going to spend here said teichner dukakis and bush are 
going to campaign here as if it were october 
what you will learn on june 7 is what message works for 
november he said 
campaigning in southern california last week jackson was doing 
his best to dispel the notion that the democratic race is already 
decided he asserted that despite the long lead in delegates that 
dukakis enjoys california could turn the race around for him 
california has the power to determine the next nominee of our 
party jackson said 
a poll this month by teichner for the san francisco examiner and 
krontv showed dukakis leading jackson 49 percent to 28 percent 
teichner said softness in dukakiss support as in other states 
suggested his lead is premised more on inevitability than an 
affinity for michael dukakis 
jackson won 21 percent of the vote in california in 1984 when 
gary hart finished ahead of eventual nominee walter mondale 
his campaign has said it hopes to outspend dukakis here and 
while most observers expect him to better his showing of four years 
ago his appeal to environmentalists blacks hispanics gays and 
young liberals suggests only limited potential unless dukakis 
voters do not turn out the spanishspeaking dukakis also has 
appeal to hispanics as he demonstrated in winning texas 
former democratic national chairman charles mannatt a los 
angeles lawyer says he expects jackson to score in the high 
30s 
san francisco polltaker mervin field said i havent seen the 
kind of elements that would auger a jackson victory 
right now i dont see him doing much better than 10 or 12 
points better than he did four years ago field said thirty or 
35 percent in a threeway race looks fairly impressive but in a 
twoway race if the winner gets 60 or 65 percent it doesnt look 
so good 
dukakis ever cautious is careful not to look beyond 
california but even so dukakis and bush have begun focusing on 
each other in campaign rhetoric and can be expected to do so 
before californias voters 
we are working hard in california said dukakis campaign 
manager susan estrich as much as we can do there now is also an 
investment for the fall 
bush campaign press secretary pete teeley said californias 47 
electoral votes are extraordinarily important to the november 
outcome and dismissed the suggestion that bushs campaign 
schedule is mimicking the travels of the democrats 
we have to get out there and begin to build a base of 
support teeley said we have to go where we have to go if 
theyre in the state theyre in the state we cant ignore the 
west 
the republicans have carried california in every presidential 
election since losing it in 1964 aided in most of those years by 
the presence of a californian on the ticket this year gov george 
deukmejian is mentioned often as a running mate for bush although 
it would mean turning over the california governors office to the 
democrats 
the size of california makes it important in any electoral 
strategy a candidate who carried california would have the same 
electoral clout as an opponent who won a dozen smaller states 
for the democrats california may loom even more important 
although democrats say theres no statebystate electoral strategy 
in mind yet bushs roots in texas give him an edge there and the 
loss of texas and california two electoral giants would make it 
extremely difficult for a democrat to win the white house 
california does occupy a pivotal position in most general 
election scenarios said paul jensen dukakis political director 
the worst thing that could happen to us obviously is to have 
our momentum broken by a strong jackson showing in california he 
said but he added it is also important to show dukakis can be 
competitive in the state for the fall

charlotte fedders ushers a guest from the 
cluttered kitchen of her suburban washington home to the sunny 
living room filled with photographs of her children 
a cat snuggling on the couch is quickly shooed away and mrs 
fedders begins to describe in even tones the physical and mental 
abuse inflicted by her husband the former top chief of enforcement 
at the securities and exchange commission 
she speaks about the violence during her 18year marriage the 
legal battles with her exhusband john fedders the resiliency of 
her five sons and her own inner strength she pauses to deal with a 
question from son peter who has padded downstairs in bare feet to 
ask do elephants have tails 
five years ago a messy kitchen cat hairs in the living room 
and a sudden display of precociousness would have been verboten in 
her book shattered dreams charlotte fedders described her 
husbands weekly whiteglove inspections in which he ran his 
fingers along tops of doors and windows and how he liked to see 
the vacuum marks in the carpet all going the same way 
as the result of her experience charlotte fedders has become 
one of the nations bestknown victims of spouse abuse she speaks 
out on the issue around the country and in return receiving 
thousands of letters filled with words of encouragement and 
personal tales of domestic violence 
i have folders of letters that i cant respond to she says 
they pour their hearts out to me theres enormous support 
they say ive done just what i had to do i had no other 
choice 
at one time the fedders family gave the appearance of an ideal 
existence wealthy suburban home exclusive country club 
membership private schools powerful washington job 
but a dirty secret festered inside the sixbedroom beige brick 
house in potomac md john fedders beat his wife 
we had been talking for a while all i remember is that this 
conversation seemed to be going well that we were really 
conversing sharing ideas we were not fighting we were not being 
sarcastic or nasty i swear we were just talking charlotte 
fedders wrote in her book referring to the first time her husband 
struck her in 1968 
but i think it was the first time i disagreed with him and was 
sticking to my guns i was arguing my point calmly but i was 
holding to it it was one good sock to the left side of my ear 
then i heard this ringing sound i found out later that he had 
broken my eardrum 
in court testimony during the february 1985 divorce trial 
charlotte fedders described seven violent incidents that occurred 
during her marriage including the time her husband struck her 
while she was four months pregnant with their first child 
he loomed over me and hit me in the abdomen three maybe five 
times hard i bent over trying to protect my tummy they were 
powerful blows it felt like taking a heavy fall i tried to 
push him away which only seemd to make him madder he yelled that 
he didnt care if he killed me or the baby she wrote in her book 
among those present in the courtroom during the divorce 
proceedings was a reporter for the wall street journal whose 
article of feb 25 on john fedders problems touched off a furor 
that forced fedders to resign his sec post late the next day 
in his resignation letter to then sec chairman john shad 
fedders said on seven occasions during more than 18 years of 
marriage marital disputes between us resulted in violence for 
which i feel and have expressed great remorse 
these isolated events do not however justify the extreme 
characterizations made in the press he said 
fedders did not respond to several telephone calls seeking his 
comments on his former wifes charges 
the ideal family was no more but the legal battles continued 
after john fedders testified he pleaded with the court to give him 
time to work out a reconciliation with his wife montgomery county 
circuit court judge james s mcauliffe suggested that the couple go 
out to dinner and try to talk things out 
that was a devastating moment charlotte fedders said in a 
recent interview recalling the 5yearold incident he thought 
it was the right thing for the kidsslashme john had promised 
never to do it again the judge showed a total lack of 
understanding of domestic violence 
in 1987 a circuit court domestics relations official john s 
mcinerney reduced john fedders alimony payments from 750 a month 
to 500 mcinerney also awarded fedders a 25 percent share of the 
proceeds from his wifes book saying she shared the blame for his 
violent outbursts because she withheld emotional support during his 
depression 
he obviously ruled very poorly he doesnt know whats 
going on she said 
judge mcauliffe in february of this year reversed mcinerneys 
action ruling that fedders could not share in the profits from his 
wifes book but his decision was based on the belief that no exact 
monetary value can be placed on a book mcauliffe said it cannot be 
considered a marital asset 
the judge also reduced john fedders alimony payments to 400 a 
month fedders had asked the court to end the payments saying the 
publicity had hurt his earning capacity by damaging his once 
successful legal career 
this particular judge made the final ruling and i did as well 
as i could do charlotte fedders said he didnt understand 
that john was manipulating the system manipulating lives 
there isnt a soul who doesnt think john fedders couldnt be 
doing well in a small way john won the judge bought johns 
truth 
for charlotte fedders the product of a strict roman catholic 
education and a family dominated by a strong father her lone 
desire was the realization of an oldfashioned dream 
all i ever wanted to be was a wife and mother she wrote in 
her book to marry a man who could give me children and a 
comfortable life filled with love and little strife so 
finding that man was very important

while working at washingtons providence hospital during her 
senior year of college charlotte odonnell met john fedders then 
a secondyear law student at catholic university 
he was the man she imagined tall 6foot10 handsome a 
catholic who wanted a family they married moved from new york to 
texas to washington as john succeeded in his law career and had 
six boys one of whom john michael died of spinal meningitis 
during their marriage according to charlottes book the couple 
lived beyond their means taking out loans to buy furniture and 
homes in wealthy neighborhoods 
the physical abuse which began in 1968 occasionally stopped 
when work went well for john fedders there was one threeyear 
break from violence but when the demands of the sec job and the 
familys financial problems got to john the beatings resumed 
there were also incidents of black moods depression and long 
silences charlotte fedders says 
i used to hide in the closet it was terrible a human 
being huddled in a closet like a prisoner of war i wasnt hiding 
from him because he was yelling at me or because he had threatened 
me id usually hide when he wasnt responding at all looking at 
me with hate or looking straight through me saying nothing i just 
couldnt stand the emotional rejection anymore she wrote 
on a number of occasions charlotte fedders took steps to end 
the marriage finally contacting a lawyer in february 1983 john 
fedders moved out of the house on july 2 
asked why she had finally pushed herself to end the marriage 
after years of abuse she talks about her own selfesteem her 
ability to survive and support a family and the impact on her sons 
the prime reason was the effect it was having on the 
children she said it took me close to a year it was obvious 
what was being directed at the children i might not deserve more 
but they deserve more 
since charlotte fedders took that step she has written a 
lengthy magazine article and collaborated on the book with laura 
elliot a senior writer at washingtonian magazine to defray the 
legal costs her older boys are working to pay for their education 
the potomac house is up for sale and the family plans to move to 
another washington suburb gaithersburg after a trip to disneyland 
this summer 
i still dont know if were finally going to make it she 
said but im really happy about things content hopeful upbeat 
about the future

here is the text of a recent speech by 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis in his campaign for the 1988 
democratic nomination for president 
 
three decades ago the soviet union launched the first satellite 
into space it was called sputnik and many said that it spelled 
the end of americas technological and economic leadership in the 
world 
we could have accepted that judgment we could have sat back and 
settled in and gone along as we were making excuses taking it 
easy living in the past 
instead we elected a new president john kennedy awakened our 
sense of possibility he rekindled our idealism he gave us 
confidence and he raised the stars and stripes so high they 
literally reached the moon 
and when john kennedy accepted the democratic nomination in 
1960 he said that today our concern must be with the future 
for the world is changing the old era is ending the old ways will 
not do 
today as in 1960 were in a battle for the economic future of 
america and now as then the old ways simply will not do 
this fall the republican party is going to be asking americans 
to keep things as they are but i say we have to change and i say 
we must change i say we must make change work for us not against 
us 
because during the past seven years ive seen too many people 
thrown out into the streets after decades on the job 
ive listened to too many people who work hard from dawn to 
midnight every day and still cant pay their bills 
ive talked to too many students who have the skills and the 
energy and the ambition to go to college but not the money 
ive read too many stories about how america is supposed to be 
in decline about how our children will have to settle for a 
secondrate economy and a secondclass future 
i dont buy that 
we americans arent about to write off a whole generation of 
young people 
were not about to accept an america where all we do is flip 
each others hamburgers and take in each others laundry for 335 
an hour 
were not about to sit on the sidelines while our neighbors are 
thrown out of work and americas home towns are boarded up and left 
to die 
as a new englander ive seen what happens when good decent 
hardworking people lose their jobs ive seen what happens to 
their families and to their communities i saw it in lowell and 
haverhill mass when the textile mills and shoe factories my 
parents had worked in when they first came to this country pulled 
up stakes and headed south i saw it when carpenters and 
bricklayers and ironworkers had to leave their homes and families 
and travel hundreds of miles to find construction work in other 
states 
over the past decade in communities all over ohio and indiana 
and throughout the midwest weve seen the same kind of pain and 
agony and uncertainty that we lived through in new england during 
the 50s and 60s and early 70s 
we see people struggling to make ends meet we see communities 
struggling to rebuild in the face of changing technology and tough 
foreign competition 
we see governors like dick celeste and mayors and community 
leaders throughout this region struggling to create a bright future 
for their citizens 
thats why this election is so important

because our citizens and communities and state and local leaders 
need a strong federal partner in the white house 
we need a president who knows how to balance a budget and mop up 
republican red ink and has done it a president who knows now to 
create jobs and how to save jobs and has done it a president 
whos been tested in the fires of debts and deficits and hard 
economic times a president with the strength the vision and the 
values to get this nation moving again 
and beginning in january of 1989 were going to build a future 
of hope and pride and opportunity for ohio and for this country 
were going to take charge of our economic future and were not 
going to stop until america is no 1 
my friends im a full employment democrat and im proud of it 
im not running for president to overthrow governments in 
central america i want to create jobs in middle america and i 
know that if we americans work together if we invest together and 
build together we can turn this country around and each and every 
one of us can be a part of it 
because if were going to make america no 1 the working men 
and women of this country must be full partners in the battle for 
our economic future 
we need a decent minimum wage law sixty years ago franklin 
roosevelt asked for a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour the 
republicans opposed it twentyeight years ago john kennedy asked 
for a minimum wage of 125 an hour the republicans opposed it 
today after the longest period in recent american history without 
an increase in the minimum wage the republicans are still opposed 
to it 
they havent changed they wont change and thats why we need 
a change in washington dc 
we need basic health insurance for every family in america im 
proud to be the first governor in the history of this nation to 
sign legislation that will guarantee health insurance for every 
citizen in my state if we can do it in one state we ought to be 
able to do it for the country 
were got to change the way we think about adult education and 
job training in this country education isnt just for the young 
and job training isnt just for those on welfare or for the 
unemployed we cant afford to treat our workers like replacement 
parts in some obsolete machine learning must be a lifelong 
process and it must be a continual ongoing part of every job in 
industrial america 
here in ohio at the chrysler plant in perrysburg labor and 
management have sponsored college level training programs in 
computer skills and electronics and financial planning and the 
metal forming and coining plant at maumee is underwriting all the 
academic courses their employees wish to take 
thats the kind of investment and teamwork we need to build a 
future where our workers are the catalysts not the victims of 
change 
were going to help our basic industries to rebuild and retool 
not by giving them massive tax breaks with no strings attached we 
dont need any more us steels taking federal help and then going 
out and buying marathon oil 
instead well say to industries in trouble well provide you 
with some protection for a limited period of time if you agree in 
advance to use that time to invest and modernize and become more 
efficient and when i say invest i dont just mean 
investments in new technology and equipment i mean investments in 
your workers and in the quality of your workplace as well 
we need a strong plant closing law that will give our workers 
the notice the training and the benefits they need to find new 
jobs with good wages when plants shut down in this country 
earlier this week the us senate voted overwhelmingly to 
approve national plant closing legislation 
president reagan has said he will veto that bill i urge him to 
sign it 
i happen to be the governor of the only state in the country 
with a comprehensive plant closing law we passed it with the 
support of labor and business and its working because weve been 
able to save thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses 
and i hope the president will take the time to think about the 3 
million american workers who lose their jobs in this country every 
year through plant shutdowns in at least half those cases those 
plants shut down with little or no notice to those most affected 
their own employees 
these people are our neighbors they deserve better from their 
employers they deserve better from america

<TEXT>
the principle behind plant closing legislation is simple if we 
want to save jobs weve got to know in advance that a factory or 
a plant is in trouble weve got to give governors and mayors and 
community leaders a chance to go to work to save those jobs to 
keep that plant open to cushion the blow for the community where 
that plant is located 
the national plant closing bill approved by congress will help 
us to save jobs it will help our workers to get the skills to find 
new jobs it will help our communities by keeping plants open it 
will help our taxpayers by reducing the cost of unemployment 
insurance and welfare it should be the law of the land 
finally if were serious about winning the battle for our 
economic future weve got to get control of the merger and 
acquisition binge thats gobbling up our capital destroying 
competition and creating billions in profits for a few without 
creating a single new job for american workers 
today too many of our best educated and most talented citizens 
are using their skills not in americas war against foreign 
competition but in a civil war for paper profits a war that pits 
region against region business against business and management 
against labor a war that weakens our economy at home and our 
competitiveness abroad a war whose primary victims are the working 
men and women of america 
during the past five years more than 12000 american 
corporations have changed hands today according to business week 
the corporate takeover wave is skyscraper high weve had 15 
takeover bids of a billion dollars or more since new years day 
less than four months ago 
and what have we got to show for it 
massive corporate debt lower quality products workers thrown 
into the streets a less competitive america 
and the profits theyre making are unbelievable weve seen 
corporate raiders make 140 million trying to take over safeway 
while 35000 workers were laid off 
weve seen raiders make 160 million in a deal that forced 
goodyear so far into debt it had to shut down plants in high 
unemployment areas in maryland and michigan and for the people of 
akron the community here in ohio which depends so heavily only 
the longterm success of goodyear there now is in the words of 
its congressman and former mayor tom sawyer a lingering sense of 
insecurity not only for the future of goodyear but for the future 
of our community 
altogether 500000 workers have lost their jobs as a result of 
the merger mania in recent years and thousands more have had 
pension plans terminated so that companies could skim the surplus 
off those pension funds 
and why are we putting up with this because we have a labor 
department and an nlrb that wont stand up for the american 
workers because weve got an attorney general who couldnt tell 
the difference between antitrust and antifreeze and a federal 
trade commission that seems to have forgotten that its job is to 
promote and encourage competition in the american marketplace 
wall street pirates and corporate hit teams arent a model for 
the best america to build the future we want were going to have 
to do what my parents and millions of immigrants did when they came 
to this country work hard save invest produce not just 
consume make sure that the label made in america the union 
label is a symbol of quality and durability and value all over 
the world 
my friends america isnt just a place its not just another 
piece of land or just another country its the noblest experiment 
ever undertaken on this planet its a symbol of what we human 
beings can do when we work together when we respect each other 
when we understand that we are one people one nation one 
community 
because there are no shortcuts to the american dream 
the best america doesnt hide we compete 
the best america doesnt waste we invest 
the best america doesnt leave some of its citizens behind we 
work for everyone 
the best america doesnt yearn for the past we prepare to take 
on the future 
the best america isnt behind us the best america is yet to 
come 
the best america is a nation where the son of greek immigrants 
can seek and win the presidency of the united states 
thank you very much

here is the text of a basic stump speech by 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson 
 
i come to you from a tradition of challenge of struggle and of 
success 
sunday march 6 marked the anniversary of bloody sunday in 
selma ala there 23 years ago marchers led by john lewis and 
young students tried to cross edmund pettus bridge demonstrating 
for the right to vote they were beaten back bloodied by dogs and 
clubs but they did not bow 
twenty years ago a generation of young americans stood up to 
end racial violence under the law when rosa parks refused to go to 
the back of the bus in montgomery ala a divinity student 
martin luther king came to her rescue when dr king was 
arrested other students and ministers came to his rescue 
in greensboro nc students sat down at lunch counters they 
ordered hamburgers but were given handcuffs they chose dignity 
over docility and young americans stood with them 
twenty years ago the moral issue of that day was racial 
violence sanctioned by the law but when young america stood tall 
the country responded today we have the right to vote we have the 
right to use libraries hotels public accommodations we have the 
right of equal access to education faced with the challenge of 
racial violence we have achieved civil rights and moved toward 
racial justice 
today as i look out over you black brown red yellow and 
white male and female i see the fruits of our labors the 
victory of young americas struggle and i rejoice for we have 
helped to keep america strong and to make america better 
in this day we face a new challenge to end economic violence 
it is the unfinished business of the country of two generations 
and it is more pressing than ever 
it is the unfinished agenda of franklin delano roosevelt and the 
generation that sacrificed so much to triumph in the second world 
war that war was fought to secure fundamental human rights 
freedom of speech and religion freedom from fear and want 
we have made great strides to achieve political and religious 
freedom in this country but the promise of economic rights and 
freedom from fear has remained unfulfilled 
twenty years ago dr martin luther king moved the country to 
help fulfill the promise of civil and political rights marching to 
end racial violence 
but dr king did not stop in selma he left us in memphis 
tenn where he stood with striking garbage workers the garbage 
workers had their civil rights they had the right to vote but 
they worked without a liveable wage they had no right to strike 
they worked but they worked in poverty dr king stood with them 
when he was taken from us 
twenty years later this unfinished business is the central 
moral challenge of the day 
plant gates that close upon workers without notice economic 
violence shipyards where goods made by repressed labor abroad 
undercut organized labor at home economic violence schoolyards 
where students with good minds cant get a scholarship and cant 
make a loan economic violence hospitals where people lie without 
care in admitting offices because they dont have a yellow or green 
card to go upstairs to a bed thats empty waiting for the insured 
to get sick economic violence 
a little known fact in america today is that most poor people 
are not black or brown most poor people are white most poor 
people are young most poor people are female and most ablebodied 
poor people are not on welfare they work but when they finish 
working they do not have a sufficient wage to lift their children 
from poverty 
the poor serve food to others every day they work hard every 
day they raise other peoples children sometimes neglecting their 
own they work hard every day they take care of the sick in 
hospitals changing their clothes and their bed pans they work 
hard every day and when they get sick they cant afford to stay in 
the hospital that they work in they work hard every day 
we are a better nation than that we need a comprehensive 
national health care program for all americans

to address this challenge we must analyze the situation 
correctly 
we have lost 650000 family farms in america over the past seven 
years workers throughout the united states auto workers steel 
workers machinists electricians computer programmers have been 
displaced from jobs 
farmers who fed the nation and fed the world know how to farm 
workers who have built the country know how to work the problem is 
not the farmer or the worker they deserve our respect the problem 
is that the structure doesnt work 
its not a question of black people taking jobs from white 
people of women taking jobs from men 
when a plant closes without notice when a farm is sold at 
auction they pull out the plug the lights go out you cant use 
color or sex for a crutch in the dark we all look remarkably 
similar in the dark 
now we hear a lot about foreign workers taiwanese koreans 
taking our jobs many seek to blame foreigners for the loss of 
jobs but foreign workers without the right to organize and barely 
the right to vote are not taking our jobs from us us 
multinational corporations are taking our jobs to them 
for example in 1986 the united states imported 7 million 
bicycles from taiwan there are no taiwanese bicycle companies 
only schwinn and other companies as the vice president of schwinn 
stated the competition from taiwan is us 
in 1986 the biggest exporter from taiwan wasnt taiwanese it 
was general electric which owns rca which owns nbc which 
advertises buy in america on television general electric took jobs 
to taiwan not looking for better labor but cheaper labor the 
american worker can compete but first we need to level the playing 
field 
general electric is one of the top 10 pentagon contractors from 
198184 it made 10 billion in profits it paid nothing in taxes 
in fact it received a 100 million tax rebate thats not fair 
its not a question of white against black or asians against 
americans its a question of barracudas and small fish 
today some 36000 workers at eastern airlines are threatened 
with the loss of their jobs unless they take 2560 percent cuts in 
pay and benefits 
why because frank lorenzo of texas air a corporate barracuda 
bought eastern and now is prepared to dismember the company in 
order to crush the union 
who pays workers pay in wage cuts and lack of protection 
passengers pay lorenzos airline conglomerate in recent months has 
the worst safety and service record in the industry communities 
pay if eastern workers are displaced the economy of atlanta will 
be depressed only the barracuda benefits 
we must change the incentives and stop the merger of 
corporations the purging of workers and the submerging of our 
economy 
we need to level the playing field we need to change the 
incentives to get corporations to reinvest in america to retrain 
our workers to reindustrialize our nation to promote research and 
development 
we must join with germany and japan to lower interest rates and 
stimulate global growth 
we must relieve the debt which is crushing the third world if 
their debt goes down our trade goes up if our trade goes up our 
deficit goes down and our economy gets moving again 
we need to make the denial of basic labor rights an unfair trade 
practice so that workers abroad have the opportunity to gain fair 
wages and working conditions 
as their wages go up they can afford to buy our goods and our 
trade goes up we all rise together either we will work to raise 
the living conditions of workers in the third world or we will 
lower our conditions toward theirs 
we need to challenge the very premise of reaganomics bush was 
right when he said this was voodoo economics but bush is the only 
person who cant quote himself 
reagan assumed that the poor had too much money the rich had 
too little and that our insecurity came from a weak military so he 
engaged in a reverse robin hood he took from the poor and gave to 
the rich 
from 1977 to 1988 the bottom 10 percent ended up paying 20 
percent more in taxes and the top 1 percent are paying 20 percent 
less in taxes 
essentially he gave the rich and the powerful a 400 billion tax 
cut 
the assumption was that they would invest in america and get our 
economy going again instead they had a party merging 
corporations speculating on junk bonds playing in the stock 
market then on oct 19 the stock market crashed now they want 
you who werent even invited to the party to pay for the party 
that is not fair 
reagan assumed that we felt insecure because our military was 
weak so he doubled the military budget in peacetime 
but he was wrong our military is strong the strongest in the 
world its our policy thats weak strong military weak policy 
we are militarily superior in central america but our policy is 
weak we are militarily superior in south africa but our policy is 
weak 
we have 26000 nuclear warheads 13000 pointing at the 
russians even president reagan has come to understand that more 
nuclear weapons simply make us less secure

we must begin to make sense 
last year there was a 19day strike of chicago school teachers 
we just couldnt find the money to pay those teachers 
well at christmas i took my children to visit the prisoners at 
cook county jail 
i did some research full year scholarship in chicago public 
schools 3500 full year scholarship at chicago state university 
1500 full year scholarship at cook county jail 12000 
schools at their worst are better than jails at their best i 
choose to invest in prenatal care head start and child care on the 
front side of life rather than welfare and jailcare on the back 
side lets make sense 
think about our security 
the no 1 threat on our streets today is not nicaragua we are 
not threatened by 3 million sandinistas and 15000 contras could 
not save us from them if we were 
the no 1 threat to our security today is drugs cocaine 
crack heroin and pcp drugs are now a 150 billion tax free 
industry 
overrunning our borders corrupting entire governments leading 
cause of crime a primary cause of aids destroying our children 
undermining workers and productivity overwhelming police forces 
threatening to bankrupt city budgets 
in a 150 billion industry more than children are involved 
bankers are involved laundering that money it is a factor in 
foreign exchange governments are involved protecting the trade 
it is an aspect of our foreign policy either the most inept or the 
most corrupt aspect of our foreign policy 
drugs are no longer a nuisance today drugs are the no 1 
threat to our national security to our children to our 
communities 
i went to the coast guard in florida 
in 1986 they interdicted 10300 pounds of cocaine in 1987 
13900 pounds then the coast guard budget was cut by 105 million 
they busted the coast guard and gave drug traffickers a green 
light when i raised a storm about it the white house called we 
didnt cut the coast guard budget the congress did 
well he fought for contra aid why not fight for coast guard 
aid if the congress wanted to cut the coast guard budget he could 
have just said no 
today we have troops in korea the philippines and europe and 
that is ok but security begins at our borders it does not make 
sense to have 325000 troops stationed in a europe at peace while 
we are overwhelmed at our borders by a threat to our children 
lets make sense 
everyone says yes we are for economic justice but we have this 
deficit were for educating our children but we have this 
deficit were for comprehensive health care but what about the 
deficit reagans basic teaching says we cant afford economic 
justice 
i say we cant afford not to have economic justice poor people 
did not cause the deficit seniors did not cause the deficit when 
you drive into a blind alley you have to get out the same way you 
got in reagan cut the taxes of the rich and the corporations and 
doubled the military budget in peacetime 
we can afford economic justice but the rich must pay their fair 
share of taxes if the top 600000 earners who make 192000 plus 
pay at the 38 percent rate rather than the 28 percent rate thats 
20 billion if the corporations pay at 1980 levels thats another 
16 billion if they pay at their average level of the 1970s 
thats over 30 billion 
we can afford economic justice but we must make choices 
today we spend some 150 billion a year defending japan and 
europe 43 years after the war europe and japan have recovered yet 
their share of total allied spending has dropped from 50 percent 
seven years ago to 30 percent today 
in europe the countries have twice the gnp and 1 times the 
population of the warsaw pact nations they can better share the 
burden of their own defense 
we can cut the military without cutting our defense 
we have no need for a midgetman missile 45 billion for a 
weapon we cant use and dont need 
we have 14 aircraft carrier task forces the soviets have none 
we do not need two more at a cost of another 34 billion 
star wars will only make us more insecure we should stop the 
crash deployment of star wars saving 200 billion to 1 
trillion over the next decade 
but we must also look beyond the effort to make sense 
we must look beyond the wars in the world to the possibility of 
peace and prosperity 
we can end the war in central america that is not our future 
our future is with 400 million latin americans friends 
neighbors customers who need medicine tractors steel 
infrastructure telecommunications and grain 
our future is not with apartheid we can end apartheid in south 
africa our future is with 560 million africans friends allies 
customers 
we must relieve israel of the burden of occupation in the middle 
east we should not choose sides in the middle east but peace 
and beyond the war beyond occupation israel and palestine can 
trade and grow and turn the desert into flowers

here is the text of a recent typical campaign 
speech by republican presidential candidate george bush 
 
as i look at it regardless of the choice on the democratic 
side the philosophical choice for the american people is going to 
be as clearly defined as the choice in 1980 or again the choice in 
1984 
and the central issue in the general election is going to be 
what will americas future be in the 1990s and as we enter the 21st 
century whats our role to be as leader of the free world the 
only power capable of advancing real peace and freedom and whats 
our place going to be in driving the economic engine of domestic 
and global prosperity 
i still dont sense an isolationistic tendency on the part of 
the people i dont believe the american people are isolationists 
i believe that our people understand and accept the international 
responsibilties that are thrust upon us 
you ask an american hey do you think somebody ought to pay 
more for defense in the persian gulf or nato or carrying the burden 
in the pacific obviously theyd say yes but i dont equate that 
with fundamental isolationism 
i believe the american people will accept the burdens of 
maintaining a strong national defense not just because we want a 
military second to none but because a strong america is going to 
lead us to a more peaceful and a less dangerous world 
the democrats urge dramatic and dangerous cuts in our military 
preparedness for the future i believe that unilateral cuts to 
eliminate or reduce our development and deployment of the mx and 
midgetman missiles two naval carrier groups meaningful research 
on sdi is simplistic naive and very shortsighted 
if weve learned anything from dealing with the soviets weve 
learned that dealing from strength results in meaningful arms 
control 
we first learned that lesson nearly 20 years ago when congress 
authorized funding for the antiballistic missile system and soon 
after that the nixon administration was able to negotiate the abm 
treaty with the soviet union had we not been willing to do that we 
never would have had a treaty 
in the early 1980s an influential element within the democratic 
party urged the united states to enter into a nuclear freeze 
agreement you remember that lock it in right now leave it the 
way it is at that time the soviets had 1000 intermediate nuclear 
force weapons deployed against europe warheads and we had zero 
instead of a freeze a freeze that would have locked in that 
asymmetry that significant imbalance in favor of the soviets we 
proposed the moral option the zero option it was called zero zero 
the option called for removal of all soviet inf missiles and in 
return we wouldnt deploy any and we were castigated for not 
knowing how to deal with the soviets and how would they ever agree 
to anything of this nature 
but because we had the strength and commitment to deploy we 
achieved an inf treaty the zero option ultimately became a 
reality the inf missles on both sides will be eliminated and for 
the first time in history we have an arms control agreement that 
eliminates an entire generation of nuclear weapons 
its done in a verifiable way with relevance in terms of our 
desire to get the conventional forces in balance have relevance in 
terms of banning chemical and biological weapons 
if we had followed the advice of the democratic left whose 
policies are now being embraced as i look at it by both the men who 
seem to be in the forefront of their run for the presidency we 
wouldnt have a treaty 
but we would have a soviet imbalance an asymmetry 1000 soviet 
weapons and zero us weapons 
the american people overwhelmingly support this treaty and 
properly so and i hope that the united states senate will stop all 
this footdragging its taking far too long in my opinion and 
will go forward and ratify that treaty before the president goes to 
the summit in moscow at the end of may

in afghanistan the soviets are pulling out and theyre pulling 
out because we did support along with some others the freedom 
fighters there and our steadfast support has worked 
it hasnt always been easy but it has worked in afghanistan 
and our sporadic and lessthandependable support has failed those 
who are fighting a totalitarianism of a similar nature right here 
in our own hemisphere in nicaragua 
on the domestic side the democrats are calling up promise after 
promise for new or expanded social programs i dont know what it 
would cost they havent told us but i do know that the single 
most important domestic economic problem fiscal problem facing 
our country is the federal budget deficit and the federal 
government cant do it all 
i dont want it said youre not compasionate you dont care 
about the homeless the elderly the uneducated i care 
desperately but i want to have a strong economy public 
partnerships can work better were sitting on the cutting edge of 
some of these problems 
i believe in the federalist system and the foremost 
responsibility i see of the president now and of the congress that 
appropriates every dime and tells us how to spend every dime is 
trying to do better on this federal budget deficit 
keeping our economy strong maintaining a strong national 
defense and maintaining a sensible foreign policy are essential if 
the united states is to remain the leader of the free world 
today the worlds changing changing rapidly communications 
are instant population is growing third world nations are 
aggressively competing for a market share in the worlds economy 
the challenge to us is how do we compete successfully in this 
dogeatdog global economy during the past decade the battle 
weve been having with our foreign competitors has been having a 
profound effect on american business and industry 
i believe that quality is the answer to the challenge we face 
from our foreign competitors our economic system is built on 
competition and it works because the truest way to succeed is to 
produce the best value for the customer 
quality is important not just to compete in the export market 
its important to compete right here at home i believe american 
industry can compete with any nation on earth 
we see new attention to cost control to lean management 
knowing how to sell in the other guys market 
i was wrong i thought that before now the trade deficit would 
be dramatically reduced from the devaluation of the currency the 
dollar vs the yen particularly 
its taken longer than i thought the japanese are absorbing 
profits to protect market share they cant do that forever im 
optimistic about the continued growth in our exports and a reducing 
of this imbalance 
exports are up dramatically real exports last year increased by 
17 percent not bad we strengthened our position as the worlds 
largest exporter of manufactured goods 
next year the us share of the world market is projected to be 
50 percent larger than west germanys and japans democrats talk 
about the decline of american industry midnight in america but 
theyre wrong transition and change would be better words this is 
whats happening in our country 
the fact of the matter is were in the midst of an industrial 
revival in this country 
a few facts between 1974 and 1984 large companies eliminated 
nearly 15 million factory jobs but at the same time 41000 new 
companies created almost as many new industrial jobs 
were in the midst of the longest peacetime expansion 155 
million new jobs europeans look at it and call it the american 
miracle and with good reason thats more jobs created in the last 
five years than europe and japan have created in the last 20 years 
and dont believe the myth that those are all bad jobs nearly 
twothirds of them are in the higherpaid skilled occupations over 
90 percent are full time 
i could go on but im in ohio and i remember when mrs robert 
a taft the wife of the great ohio senator said one time i 
always find that statistics are hard to swallow and impossible to 
digest the only one i can ever remember is that if all the people 
who go to sleep in church were laid end to end theyd all be a lot 
more comfortable

to maintain this strong economy weve got to get the federal 
budget deficit down 
and weve got to do it by holding the line on spending and the 
answer for the deficit is for the president to make the tough calls 
and take the heat 
congress has demonstrated that it is unwilling to do that they 
appropriate every dime spend every dime tell us how to spend 
every dime the american people see that theyre the ones that are 
responsible 
and lastly if i could look back at the end of four years and 
somebody said what have you accomplished id like to be able to 
say i was the education president i was the person who backed up 
those school principals and those good school teachers who know the 
name of the kids that are teaching those four values reading 
riting rithmetic and respect in the classroom 
i want to lead the federal government to do more in helping for 
the disadvantaged do better a job in helping young families just 
getting started to save through tax exemptions save so that they 
can educate their own kids its a partnership we cant turn to 
the federal government to do it all but we must do a better job on 
education 
i think people are going to go into that voting booth next fall 
and theyre going to say who has the value that we believe in who 
has the experience to lead this the greatest countryon the face of 
the earth who has the stability the integrity to get the job 
done 
i wouldnt be asking for your vote if i didnt feel that i am 
that man 
i will never apologize for the united states of america i will 
keep her strong i will lead her i will reach out with compassion 
to all americans to make them understand that this indeed is the 
best the most generous nation on the face of the earth

no release date was given for home video buyers 
the 35 million george lucas fantasy opens on may 20 and with 
an advertising budget of 20 million is expected to be one of the 
seasons top celluloid winners 
it is a beautifully filmed tale of good versus evil pulling out 
all the parables from the story of moses to return of the jedi 
there are virtually no stars the hero is a dwarf and special 
effects from the lucas bag of tricks abound 
the combination of george lucas producing and ron howard 
directing is sure to result in a wonderful film that will be a big 
worldwide hit both theatrically and in home video said robert 
blattner president of rcacolumbia pictures 
a superhit thats already proven itself will also be available

throw momma from the train orion home video vhsbeta 
8998 rated r 
 
throw momma from the train could have been titled how to 
kill your mother and cure writers block 
a hopelessly bad writer with a hellion of a mother meets a 
college professor who cant get past the first three words of a 
book hes trying to write and despises his far more successful 
former wife 
inspired by alfred hitchcocks strangers on a train the 
aspiring writer proposes a hitchcockian double murder and ensnares 
the unwitting professor in his plot 
you have to like a movie like that 
yet this film a boxoffice sleeper starring danny devito as the 
motherhater and billy crystal who is terrific as the schlemiel 
professor never quite fulfills the potential of its hilarious 
premise 
devito who showed himself a true comic genius in his tv role as 
louie depalma in taxi is only fleetingly funny in this film 
this also represents devitos debut as a feature film director 
and he doesnt rev throw momma up to the comic pitch one would 
hope for 
still crystals energy and ingenious timing are enough to keep 
the film moving and he gets hilarious help from anne ramsey who 
won a welldeserved oscar nomination for her work as the momma with 
the face of a harpy and a voice that makes nails on a chalkboard 
sound sweet by comparison 
as devito tries to draw crystal into his matricide scheme he 
says look just meet her maybe shes someone youd like to 
kill 
it is no small feat for a film to make matricide acceptable and 
often very funny

julia and julia 
 
peter del montes julia and julia is the kind of movie one 
would rather forget it is so jumbled so poorly written acted and 
edited that it makes attack of the killer tomatoes look like a 
work of genius 
it is not a film one should pay money to see on the big screen 
however you wont be too angry if you merely rent a videocassette 
the story oblique at best revolves around julia kathleen 
turner whose husband paolo gabriel byrne dies in a car crash on 
their wedding day a few years later still sloshing through an 
uneventful and melancholic life in trieste she returns home one 
night to find paolo and their son 
however in this new life julia also has taken a lover 
daniel sting who is given to brutalizing her 
throughout the remainder of the movie julia roams from this 
ghost life to her real life but its hard to separate 
illusion from reality 
its also hard having any real feeling for the characters 
because with the exception of sting they are transparent and not 
terribly interesting especially turner 
as an actress kathleen turners ability is questionable she 
seems to be the end result of a welloiled hype machine in julia 
julia shes about as convincing and compelling as a box of 
prunes given to long intakes of air and misplaced angst where she 
should be a confused tragic heroine 
nor is she particularly sensual seemingly her strong point if 
we are to believe the hype machine rather she is largely 
narcoleptic 
byrne does the best he can with a limp script but remains tepid 
at best

rock of life rca rick springfield 
 
rick springfield bares his soul on rock of life his first 
album in three years he attributes the hiatus to burnout which he 
describes on the title cut and world start turning 
on the latter he sings made a promise to myself ill never 
get that low again 
the problem is that springfields confessional is delivered for 
the most part via mechanical repetitive arrangements and layered 
harmonies compressed into music thats obviously aimed at top 40 
radio the result is a record that sounds impersonal despite its 
autobiographical nature 
its too bad because springfield went into the studio with 
something to say god bless the house the car and the tv they 
built us a prison without any locks he sings on tear it all 
down 
but the only arrangements that work are honeymoon in beirut 
a dead ringer for hall and oates and a thundering cover of the 
small faces if you think youre groovy elsewhere 
springfield lets his blues get buried in overdubs that turn rock 
of life to rubble

lynyrd skynyrd tribute tour 1987 mca southern by the grace 
of god 
now ask yourself does the world really need another 13minute 
version of free bird sung this time by a few thousand offkey 
concertgoers from dallas 
of course not 
but such worldly questions obviously never faze record company 
executives thats why records such as southern by the grace of 
god credited to the lynyrd skynyrd tribute tour 1987 are stacked 
in the stores 
survivors of this influential southern rock band which lost 
three members in a 1977 plane crash reunited for a tour last year 
to cash in on the groups memory johnny van zant replaced his 
brother ronnie as the singer and frontman for the new skynyrd 
not real as the copywriters like to say but an incredible 
simulation 
you cant argue too much about a tour since worse things have 
been done in the name of nostalgia a live record is another story 
in an attempt to pay tribute to such songs as free bird and 
sweet home alabama the reconstituted skynyrd only demeans 
them how can expecting fans to pay money to hear other fans sing a 
cherished song be viewed as anything but an insult why ask fans to 
pay for subpar reruns of songs when the originals are easily 
available 
even setting aside the concept the record is sloppy it opens 
with an address to a crowd in dallas switches to atlanta a few 
songs later then quickly heads back to dallas a little editing 
would have eased the sense of disorientation the gratuitious 
profanity can go too 
its also one of those recordings better suited to the cd format 
than an awkward twoalbum set free bird with 1311 of music 
fills an entire side 
the surviving skynyrds dont musically embarrass themselves but 
thats not the point theres no excuse for turning lynyrd skynyrd 
into another beatlemania

her life is a casebook of survival and 
patricia neal is talking about it these days with complete candor 
revealing her forbidden love for gary cooper and the deception by 
her former husband writer roald dahl 
she is calling attention to her autobiography as i am by 
doing interviews three a day is all she can manage 
the effects of her nearfatal stroke and a joblike series of 
tragedies are still apparent difficulty in walking furtive 
searches for words and memories but she dismisses her failings 
with the familiar throaty laugh 
miss neals voice retains that mellow quality that fascinated 
viewers of the fountainhead a face in the crowd hud 
for which she received the academy award as best actress and the 
subject was roses it reflects the years as wife and mother in 
england but the undertones of her beginnings in packard ky are 
unmistakable and there is no mistaking that she remains at 62 a 
rare beauty 
as i am written with richard deneut tells it all she 
arrived in hollywood in 1948 after a smashing success on broadway 
in another part of the forest all of the studios sought her 
but she signed a warner bros contract because jack warner promised 
her the hit play john loves mary her costar was ronald reagan 
when i started john loves mary jane wyman announced that 
she was divorcing ronnie miss neal recalled so he didnt have 
an easy time on that film then i did the fountainhead and 
ronnie and i both went to london to do the hasty heart we lived 
side by side in a hotel and while we never dated we often went to 
dinner together 
i was in love with someone he didnt know about no one did 
and he was still very much enamored of jane wyman after we 
finished the picture he went back and started going with his 
present wife nancy 
the romance that no one knew about was with her fountainhead 
costar gary cooper it had to be secret because he was married 
to the socialite veronica rocky balfe 
miss neal writes that cooper once hit her because she dated kirk 
douglas and that she had an abortion after becoming pregnant by 
cooper 
why is she finally telling the story of her love for cooper 
well if i write a book on my life and i leave gary cooper 
out it wont be a real true story she said he was my great 
passion for a long time looking back i still adore him and will 
always adore him he was my man 
when it first started i didnt think of marrying gary ever 
it was just my quick love and i hoped that no one would know but 
i really loved him and it went on and on in the end we had to 
break it up 
in 1953 miss neal married the writer of mystery and childrens 
stories roald dahl they settled in great missenden near london 
and had three children the tragedies began baby theo was hit by a 
new york taxi and nearly died young olivia died suddenly of 
measles 
miss neal suffered a massive stroke while preparing to film 
seven women with john ford only after 21 days did her doctor 
tell dahl that his wife who was pregnant would live 
it was a hard time to learn to talk again to walk again 
she said i didnt know one word from the other my son had great 
cards with words written on them he she cat dog and 
he would hold them up to me 
recovery was long and slow and she was constantly driven by 
dahl their fourth child ophelia was born with no ill effects 
from her mothers illness 
in 1968 dahl pushed his wife into doing the film the subject 
was roses much against her will though she was later glad that 
she did it she continued acting in films and television always 
returning to great missenden what she didnt know was that dahl 
was carrying on an affair with felicity crossland an english 
fashion coordinator 
my husband was a tricky man it turned out miss neal said 
i dont know how many years he had other women in the end he 
wanted a divorce so he could marry his nowwife 
i was so bitter you have no idea how horrible i was but all 
of a sudden it vanished i dont feel bitter anymore 
the family stayed in england and miss neal now lives in a new 
york apartment and a summer home on marthas vineyard gary 
coopers daughter maria who first contacted her after the 
strokes had recommended a connecticut abbey where miss neal found 
solace in retreats she wrote her book there it was also through 
maria that she met rocky cooper 
when rockys second husband died i wrote her a letter miss 
neal said she was so delighted with it and i got a letter from 
her it was written on the birthday of my darling olivia the one 
who died its extraordinary how these things happen on a certain 
day a meeting was arranged and the two women shared memories of 
the man they both loved 
how has she managed to survive her disasters 
when something happens you think its going to kill you 
she replied but it doesnt kill you so you live through that 
when the second one happens you get stronger you get stronger all 
the time all the time even though i have a filthy temper when 
things go wrong and i have no control over them i realize that i 
have no control 
i have survived so far ive been told by three fortunetellers 
that im going to live till 95 so you can see that i have some 
years left

a huge water tank hangs suspended between 
the dome of egypts new opera house and the elaborate tiers of its 
flowershaped ceiling 
the tank underlines the designers determination that the 
beigecolored neoislamicstyle cairo education and culture center 
wont suffer the same fate as the opera house its historic 
predecessor destruction by fire 
built in 1869 for the inauguration of the suez canal the ornate 
old opera house went up in flames in 1971 an unexplained fire that 
left egypts culture lovers bereft and homeless 
the new japanesebuilt center houses a 1300seat opera house 
two smaller theaters a museum a library an art gallery a 
conference hall and artistic training rooms still everyone from 
builders to the media refer to the center as the new opera 
it was turned over to the culture ministry on march 10 and will 
have its official inauguration on oct 10 
the loss of the old house in which plays for the common man 
were as likely to be presented as grand opera was a trauma for 
egypt thousands of cairenes stood in horror on oct 28 1971 
watching their beloved opera house burn for several days 
cairos main firefighting station was less than 100 yards away 
but experts said the fire could not be stopped the building was 
primarily made of timber and hundreds of costumes and props helped 
feed the flames 
i was there with many egyptians standing and crying as we 
watched it burn said magda saleh 43 the new operas director 
fire precautions have been installed the water tank has a 
capacity of 78000 gallons 
theres also fireresistant fabrics and materials throughout the 
complex sprinkler and smokedetection systems 158 fire 
extinguishers and a huge fireresistant curtain between the stage 
and the audience 
miss saleh a former prima ballerina with the ballet company of 
egypts academy for arts expects big things from the center 
its a magnificent facility she said we anticipate it 
will revolutionize culture in egypt and we hope the whole region 
and internationally as well 
the complex located on cairos posh zamalek island was 
financed by a 1984 grant from the japanese government of 65 
billion yen then worth 30 million 
no expense has been spared swedish pine floors italian marble 
and japanese electronics the complexs interior color schemes vary 
from light pink to crimson and dark coral and the sharply sloping 
main auditorium features plush floor seats topped by 
horseshoeshaped tiers of boxes 
in the main hall most walls are covered with ceramics which 
japanese architects said was for acoustics as much as for easy 
maintenance the ceiling is fiberglass and czech crystal shaped 
like a kind of flower uniting the egyptian lotus and the japanese 
cherry blossom 
the stage is large by world standards with a maximum width of 
53 feet a height of 30 feet and a depth of 109 feet 
a japanese construction company kajima corp built the 
sevenstory complex in 34 months 
miss saleh said she is organizing an elaborate inauguration 
ceremony as she tries to piece together the operas first season 
at the oct 10 inauguration gala traditional egyptian and 
japanese classical music and western classics will be performed 
climaxing a month of celebrations that will include openair 
festivals along the nile river outside the complexs front gate 
for the inaugural season miss saleh has booked the london 
festival and the paris opera ballet troupes and hopes to sign 
moscows bolshoi ballet personally requested by president hosni 
mubarak 
the london festival ballet will open the season on oct 25 with 
les sylphides a ballet that has never been performed in egypt 
the opera will be a home for egyptian artists but i have also 
been contacting african asian and arab groups miss saleh said 
we will not be limited to opera ballet and symphony any variety 
of excelled art will be invited 
she said ticket prices for the new center have not been set but 
that she is aiming to keep them fairly low so average egyptians 
will not be deprived of the arts 
mubarak specifically asked for the opera house on a visit to 
japan in 1983 it raised eyebrows that his request for aid should 
be for a culture center instead of other more pressing economic 
needs 
miss saleh egypts prima ballerina from 196671 said she hopes 
the complex will become an educational center a gathering place 
for young artists and a place where young egyptians can learn to 
appreciate the arts 
one stumbling block she expects is money both to maintain the 
huge complex and to attract internationally acclaimed performers 
she would not say how much money the financially strapped 
government has budgeted for the opera house but she said she hopes 
to receive subsidies from the culture ministry and to start local 
and regional systems of fund raising

virginia is more than just bruce hornsbys home 
state its the source of the preachers pregnant girls gossips 
and good ol boys who populate his sliceofsouthernlife songs 
a lot of our inspiration comes from southern literature 
this album to us we tried to make it a musical version of a 
shortstory collection hornsby said of his scenes from the 
southside the followup to 1986s platinum record the way it 
is 
i read a lot i read a lot of fiction and i guess that 
influences my writing said hornsby who cited littleknown 
southern writers lee smith and william hoffman as favorites i 
want it to have that same sort of quality 
on his debut album with his band the range hornsby was able to 
do just that racking up three hit singles including the title 
track his success was the result of persistence as much as talent 
hornsby was rejected repeatedly until signing with rca records 
and watching his career take off 
the new record is filled with characters from hornsbys days in 
his hometown of williamsburg va from the shady evangelists of 
jacobs ladder and defenders of the flag to the smalltown 
gossips of the show goes on 
were just writing about things that happen in virginia and 
pat robertson and jerry falwell certainly come from virginia 
said hornsby who has lived in california for the past several 
years 
everybody thinks we wrote about jim bakker but weve known 
about this stuff for years people in high places doing less than 
admirable things 
going into the studio to record the second album was a much 
different experience from the first time around hornsby said his 
brother and writing partner john was in law school forcing 
hornsby to write more alone there was also pressure to produce 
another hit 
frankly the pressure on the first album was more intense 
because it was more of a survival thing said hornsby if that 
record had just come out and stiffed we might not have gotten 
another shot 
the pressure of this one is different its like well if we 
fell on our faces last time nobody wouldve known about it if we 
fall on our faces this time everybody knows about it theres 
always that sophomore jinx thing 
to fight that scenes from the southside is a bit different 
from the first album a lot more jams theres a lot of soloing 
a lot more piano its a lot more stretched out hornsby said 
during a recent interview 
hes also not too worried about critical reception of the record 
we write the song because it means something to us as a story 
from our past and musically as an interesting combination of 
styles he said thats what we think about not whether its 
going to go along with the new pebbles record 
hornsby was referring to the single by pebbles called 
girlfriend which has shot up the record charts and remains in 
the top 10 
hornsbys first single from the new lp the valley road 
features a piano riff over a straightahead rock beat much in the 
style of jazz keyboardist mccoy tyner hornsby said 
one things for sure the valley road doesnt sound a 
thing like anything on the radio thats either the good news or 
the bad news well see he said 
hornsby an accomplished accordionist in addition to his piano 
and organ playing has also kept busy working with other artists 
huey lewis who scored a top 10 hit with his version of jacobs 
ladder again recruited hornsby for his new album lewis returned 
the favor by playing harmonica on defenders of the flag 
don henley and hornsby have cowritten a song for the exeagles 
next solo album hornsby has also contributed accordion work on 
upcoming albums by dave stewart of the eurhythmics kim carnes and 
patti austin 
but its still the southern social observations that hornsby 
enjoys best and after several years in los angeles hes moving 
back to williamsburg va where hell store away more material for 
future albums 
unless 
who knows maybe well move back there and write about la 
hornsby said his voice giving way to a laugh

mention the hoax and clifford irving casts his 
eyes downward shakes his head and offers a smirk of mild disgust 
that 16 years and six books later the subject still pops up 
irving would like to talk about books he has written not about 
the chicanery that put him in prison in the early 1970s after he 
duped a publisher out of 650000 by claiming he had compiled an 
autobiography of the late reclusive billionaire howard hughes 
the bearded pensive new yorker is something of a recluse 
himself now living in a small mexican mountain community he has 
emerged to talk about his latest book a chronicle of the 1982 
murders of a houston lawyer and his wife plotted by their 
daughter carried out by her boyfriend uncovered by a private eye 
but he knows the hughes scam will dog him to the end 
i just dont want to talk about it because i dont think its 
fair its so long ago whatever penalties there are for avoiding 
the question i will endure them i just dont want to discuss 
it he said 
but ask irving about daddys girl the campbell murder case 
summit books 1995 and hell ramble on about the underbelly of 
american life and the criminal justice system he says he discovered 
while researching and ultimately becoming a player in the texas 
case 
in june 1982 james m campbell 55 and his wife virginia 50 
were killed by a 45caliber pistol while they slept the killer 
fired over their two grandchildren who were asleep at the foot of 
the bed 
nearly three years later a 23yearold private detective named 
kim paris romanced david duval west into confessing to the campbell 
murders he was convicted of murder the campbells daughter 
cynthia ray was found guilty in a separate trial of plotting the 
crime in order to gain an inheritance 
for irving what started as a trip to houston in search of a 
good dentist ended as a twoyear investigation culminating with the 
author taking the stand to dispute the testimony of a key 
prosection witness 
my interest was superficial at the beginning a beautiful 
young private eye seduces a murderer into confession irving said 
during a promotional swing through boston then i got to know the 
murderer the alleged murderer and i wasnt so sure he had done 
it 
irving testified in the west trial that a witness he had 
interviewed lied on the stand when he said irving had made him get 
drunk in order to obtain information he battled with a prosecutor 
i was so involved at this point that i couldnt believe it 
irving said i certainly had never intended it 
his involvement stretched to attending judges conferences with 
attorneys taping courtroom proceedings despite a court ban and 
developing close friendships with lawyers on both sides of the 
case the experience was uniquely texan 
texas is different its still the frontier the wild west 
said irving dressed in a brown tweed jacket and a pair of 
elephanthide boots certainly the intimacy of the courtroom is 
different its clubby a philadelphia lawyer who knew what i was 
doing said you could never do this in philadelphia you could never 
get that close 
since the campbell trials ended last year the 55yearold 
irving has returned to san miguel allende population 20000 where 
he lives with the youngest of his three sons 
irvings steely blue eyes and public love affairs once commanded 
as much attention as the hoax hes living alone now adding that 
after four divorces im not very good at domesticity 
hes working on a new project a twisty novel about the ethics 
of the law set in texas a screenplay about young love in the 
1950s is on hold because of a strike by hollywood writers cbs is 
negotiating to make a tv movie out of the campbell case and he 
hopes an oliver stone screenplay of his 1982 novel tom mix and 
pancho villa will get produced 
irving says credibility is no longer an issue 
i dont think about that anymore he said i know im 
credible everyone in houston knows they can count on me this book 
was well researched 
in 1972 though irving told mcgraw hill inc that he had 
compiled an autobiography of howard hughes as the result of 100 
secret meetings which never took place the book was deemed a 
fraud irving was sentenced to 2 years in prison and he became an 
instant celebrity appearing on the cover of time as con man of 
the year 
for irving its nothing more than a footnote to his career not 
how he wishes to be defined

alabama whose rousing instrumentals and 
moving ballads have set the standard for country music in the 
1980s is fighting to maintain its eminence 
the group with footstomping fiddle tunes and mesmerizing 
melodies has drastically reduced its concert appearances is 
winning fewer awards and learning that no 1 records are no longer 
automatic 
nevertheless alabama guitarist teddy gentry says 
weve been written off several times but my feeling is were 
together and making the best music weve ever made and things are 
better in more ways than ever weve worked out any problems we 
had were contented 
the fourmember band has sold about 30 million records in the 
past eight years since the group which hails from fort payne 
ala left a beach bar in myrtle beach sc where they played for 
tips 
they won backtoback grammy awards in 1983 and 1984 for 
mountain music and the closer you get the group starred in 
a network tv special and performed up to 300 days on the road each 
year 
but as new acts came along and country fans formed new 
allegiances alabama now finds its oncetorrid pace a bit tempered 
gentry said the group will perform 80 to 90 concerts this year 
down from 130 in 1987 and onethird of their frantic schedule five 
years ago 
you have to cut back in markets for a year or two he said 
the group won dozens of awards this decade but their bulging 
trophy case has not inherited as much hardware in the past couple 
of years 
the judds highway 101 and the forester sisters have won some of 
the awards that alabama had a lock on a few years ago 
we can grow as artists and writers gentry said in an 
interview weve got a lot of good years left it would be a 
detriment to win more awards 
in november their personal and autobiographical song tar 
top was the first alabama single to fail to reach no 1 on the 
country music charts after 21 in a row spanning a remarkable eight 
years 
we felt it was different and we agreed to put it out even if 
it might not make no 1 gentry said we wanted it out for the 
band and for the fans 
another no 1 would not have done us any good at that point 
he said it was a controversial song and it got people to talk 
about the group again it accomplished what we set out for it to do 
it got the other record companies off our backs they had 
parties and celebrated 
the group three of the four are cousins bounced back with a 
no 1 record in january face to face 
though their career has evened off the band can boast of 
stirring hit records such as dixieland delight and old 
flame and sensuous softer songs such as touch me when were 
dancing and feels so right 
theyve had so many hits that at concerts they are forced to 
perform three medleys and trim the length of several other songs 
we have to leave out a bunch said gentry who once laid 
carpet for a living 
they pioneered the sound of country bands and their success led 
nashville record companies to sign other groups such as exile and 
restless heart 
says joe bonsall lead singer for the rival oak ridge boys 
they are the greatest act thats ever been in our business 
gentry analyzing the bands success points to versatility 
organization energy and other factors 
weve been able to write our own songs he said early in 
your career you dont get pitched the good songs that others do 
weve put together the best organization i know of from management 
to the road crew theyve been with us for years 
weve tried to act as good businessmen we go to the functions 
and meet the people and do those things 
weve had a range of material he continued kids identify 
with some of it and the good ol boys with gun racks in their 
pickup trucks like others and there are the gentle love songs that 
women like we like our range of music and were capable of doing a 
lot of songs 
weve not been afraid to change weve been independent 
theres a real feeling by the people that we give them 
everything weve got all the feeling all the energy we can for 
that applause the people know when youre playing for yourself or 
when youre playing for them 
i like to sit and watch the people come in to the concert and 
study them i wonder what he does for a living it amazes me 
that so many types of people enjoy our music

entrepreneurs are playing an increasingly 
important role in leading the nations largest blackowned 
companies according to a new survey 
black enterprise magazines latest annual survey of the top 100 
blackowned industrial and service companies released monday 
indicates black entrepreneurs are becoming more active in sectors 
ranging from manufacturing and advertising to construction and 
franchising 
the entrepreneurs many of whom are using nontraditional 
financing techniques to acquire and restructure companies are 
different from traditional executives who have been with the same 
company for years working to build it up 
the rise of black entrepreneurs mirrors developments in us 
companies in general many of which have been taken over or been 
forced to restructure to face competition and an uncertain economy 
a key example is wall street attorney reginald f lewis who 
heads tlc beatrice international holdings inc by far the largest 
blackowned company new yorkbased tlc beatrice a food processor 
and distributor formed from the 985 million leveraged buyout of 
beatrice international also was the fastestgrowing according to 
the survey 
in a leveraged buyout the acquirer finances the purchase of the 
target company with sales of its assets or from its cash flow 
tlc beatrice was the first blackowned company to make more than 
1 billion in annual sales and it posted revenue of 18 billion in 
1987 its 61 businesses include butterball turkeys and good humor 
ice cream 
the buyout of beatrice places lewis on the cutting edge of 
corporate finance and gives him access to europe latin america and 
asia three of the worlds fastestgrowing markets the survey 
stated 
another black entrepreneur j bruce llewellyn of philadelphia 
cocacola bottling co has propelled the company into the no 3 
slot on the list with 166 million in sales last year llewellyn 
has acquired several profitable companies through joint ventures 
with other black entrepreneurs and has added 36 new routes to his 
bottling operation 
he recently purchased another coke bottling franchise in 
wilmington del and expects to surpass 200 million in sales this 
year 
other black business operators such as gary l white of trans 
jones incjones transfer co and c everett wallace of city amp 
suburban distributors inc have used leveraged buyouts to put 
their companies in the top 100 they are in the process of selling 
off their nonperforming assets and setting up strict financial 
controls the survey says 
trans jones a transportation services company based in monroe 
mich is seventh on the list with 793 million in 1987 revenue 
city amp suburban a chicagobased beer distributor rolled out 37

the canadian dollars sharp twoyear rise stemmed 
mainly from higher interest rates not from any secret deal under 
the nations pending us trade pact according to the head of 
canadas central bank 
bank of canada governor john crow said monday that the canadian 
dollars nearly 31 percent rise since february 1986 came as 
canadian interest rates were being driven higher to help cool 
domestic inflationary pressures 
the canadian dollar rose from an alltime low of 69 us cents 
in february 1986 to more than 81 cents in april 
opposition parties and other commentators have suggested that 
prime minister brian mulroney sacrificed the advantages of a weaker 
currency which makes canadian products relatively cheaper in 
foreign markets in order to secure the free trade agreement with 
the united states 
there is no deal on the exchange rate at all crow said at a 
meeting with foreign correspondents 
the trade pact was signed jan 2 and is to be ratified later 
this year it would eliminate all tariffs and dismantle many 
nontariff barriers in what is already the worlds biggest trading 
partnership 
some canadian exporters have complained that canadian dollars 
rise had cost them foreign business for example noranda inc the 
forestry and resource giant has said it lost 80 million in profit 
last year because of the currencys surge 
crow acknowledged such complaints but noted that the canadian 
currencys rise had been halted last month bank of canada figures 
released last week indicated the central bank spent more than 1 
billion during april to keep a lid on the canadian currency which 
closed monday at 8072 us cents 
crow also said the trade pact did not mean the two currencies 
eventually would become equal 
he drew a distinction between the uscanada pact an agreement 
on goods and services and the kind of currency union that could 
emerge in the 12nation european economic community under a 
proposed european central bank 
looking ahead to the june 1921 economic summit in toronto crow 
said he concurred with the finance ministers of the seven major 
industrialized countries that the us dollar had fallen far enough 
against other currencies in the past two years 
the socalled group of seven nations involved in the talks are 
the united states canada japan west germany britain france and 
italy 
asked what he would like to see emerge from the summit crow 
said that whatever initiatives were taken or statements made he 
hoped they dont give the impression were off on another round 
of world inflation 
crow also expressed concern about inflationary pressures in 
canada which had the developed worlds highest economic growth 
rate of 575 percent last year and anticipates a 17 percent 
increase in factory investment this year 
but with latest figures showing growth stalled at the start of 
this year he forecast reduced demand in 1988 which he said should 
help curb inflation

a woman was found guilty of killing her husband 
and a woman to collect more than 175000 in insurance and the 
prosecutor says the conviction in the nations first 
deathbyproducttampering trial will stop drug tamperers 
stella nickell 44 of suburban auburn was convicted monday of 
all five counts in the deaths of her 52yearold husband bruce 
and sue katherine snow 40 also of auburn 
federal court jurors who deliberated nearly five days said 
mrs nickells daughters testimony against her mother proved 
crucial mrs nickell scheduled for sentencing june 17 could 
receive life in prison prosecutors also are considering state 
murder charges 
it was all there for jurors to make this decision 
assistant us attorney joanne maida said adding that the verdict 
will be a deterrent to wouldbe drug tamperers 
jury foreman murray m andrews 55 said the panel was split 
111 in favor of conviction through its first three votes 
juror laurel holliday who wept when the verdict was announced 
told us district judge william dwyer on monday she received an 
anonymous call friday from a woman who said dont you all know 
she mrs nickell failed the lie detector test 
results of mrs nickells polygraph test were not introduced as 
evidence 
ms holliday said she told no other jurors about the call and 
vowed to disregard the information when the judge told her to do so 
defense lawyer tom hillier who declined dwyers offer to excuse 
ms holliday said monday night he planned to appeal 
assuming the 111 split included a vote of not guilty by the 
same juror who reported having been tampered with earlier this 
morning then its my belief that thats no coincidence and that 
that has to be investigated if for no other reason than to insure 
the integrity of the jury system he said 
the testimony of cindy hamilton mrs nickells 28yearold 
daughter was decisive i think without cindys testimony there 
were you might say too many missing links in the chain of 
evidence he said 
ms hamilton testified her mother discussed killing nickell by a 
drug overdose or by hiring a hit man 
although prosecutors were unable to link mrs nickell directly 
to cyanide purchases she was convicted of all five counts she 
faced two of causing death by tampering with a product involved in 
interstate commerce and three of tampering 
beset by financial problems and unhappy in her marriage mrs 
nickell laced extrastrength excedrin capsules with cyanide and 
gave them to her husband for a headache prosecutors said 
to make his death appear random she poisoned other bottles of 
excedrin and anacin capsules and put them on store shelves ms 
snow died after swallowing capsules from one of those bottles six 
days after nickell the prosecution said 
her husband paul webking said she might still be alive if 
local authorities had recognized the real cause of nickells death 
initially attributed to emphysema 
the effect of the verdict is secondary to the fact that sue is 
dead webking said no matter what the verdict is sues going 
to be dead 
i wish theyd hang her to the highest tree said ms snows 
mother marion chapman in a telephone interview from artesia nm 
king county prosecutor norm maleng said he would wait until 
after sentencing to decide whether to file state murder charges 
the deaths of nickell and ms snow touched off a nationwide 
tampering scare and prompted excedrin manufacturer bristolmyers to 
recall its capsuled nonprescription medicines 
product tampering is intolerable to society john weisberg 
spokesman for new yorkbased bristolmyers said when it occurs 
every effort must be made to identify those responsible and to 
bring them to justice he said 
seven people died in chicago in 1982 from cyanidelaced 
extrastrength tylenol but those deaths remain unsolved 
ms maida accused mrs nickell of poisoning her husband to 
collect on his life insurance hillier said mrs nickell was the 
victim of a lying daughter who stood to gain a 300000 reward from 
pharmaceutical companies for information leading to an arrest 
mrs nickells plan failed because she was careless in mixing 
the poisonous capsules greedy for insurance benefits and owned two 
of the five tainted bottles of painkillers recovered ms maida 
said in closing arguments 
mrs nickell a tropical fish enthusiast used a bowl 
contaminated with an algaeicide for cleaning fish tanks when she 
mixed potassium cyanide with the anacin and excedrin painkillers 
the prosecution alleged 
traces of the compound were found in the five tainted bottles 
mrs nickell also lied about insurance policies and pressed 
medical authorities for a more specific cause of death ms maida 
said 
mrs nickell stood to receive 71000 in insurance if the death 
of her husband was from emphysema as pathologists first concluded 
but could have gotten 176000 if the death were ruled accidental 
the prosecutor said 
mrs nickell also left fingerprints on library books about 
poisons and cyanide ms maida said

appearing on television for the first time 
to discuss his landmark cigarette liability lawsuit was a little 
embarrassing for retired construction worker antonio cipollone but 
he got used to that 
but things were different when a lawyer for one of the tobacco 
company defendants started discussing the behavior of cipollones 
wife rose a 40year smoker who died of lung cancer 
it bothered me and i felt like getting up and punching him in 
the mouth cipollone said but i kept cool and calm 
the softspoken 64yearold italian immigrant wouldnt say what 
statement he was referring to throughout the trial attorneys for 
the cigarette companies have focused on mrs cipollones behavior 
to show she smoked of her own free will despite repeated warnings 
from her husband about the dangers 
the angry statement was an exception for cipollone a mild man 
given to sweater vests kind smiles and friendly greetings in the 
corridors of the federal courthouse in newark 
for four months cipollone has sat quietly and patiently behind 
the plaintiffs table as a dozen attorneys battle over a case that 
has become a cause celebre for antismoker forces and a concern for 
the 22 billion tobacco industry 
mrs cipollone died in 1984 at age 58 her husbands is the face 
behind the heading cipollone v liggett group inc et al 
which has appeared atop dozens of court opinions some of which 
have established important precedents on procedural issues 
decisions in the case have passed through the us supreme 
court appellate panels and state courts nationwide 
the name cipollone has been uttered on national television and 
written on the pages of most major news publications 
despite his new place in the public light and american 
jurisprudence i did not change one bit at all cipollone said 
in a light accent of his native land during an interview last week 
im still the same ill be the same the rest of my life 
the case is considered important because of the breadth of 
internal tobacco company documents obtained by the plaintiffs and 
the possible public relations harm to an industry that has never 
paid damages to someone suing it for making a product that 
allegedly brought on disease and death 
cipollone charges three companies liggett philip morris co 
and lorillard inc are liable for his wifes illness by covering 
up the dangers of smoking the companies counter that she was an 
intelligent woman who smoked because she wanted to despite knowing 
the dangers they deny smoking causes lung cancer 
cipollone says he approaches his prominence with a sense of 
responsibility but if he should win putting the cipollone name 
firmly in history 
i would be proud that i did something he said 
the thing is with this case my wife started it and i pursued 
the case because she told me in case anything should happen to 
me you should pursue the case 
the lawsuit was filed a year before mrs cipollone died 
a lifetime of hard work did not prepare cipollone for what he is 
doing now 
i didnt have the slightest idea that this would take so 
long he said 
born in a small village in the countryside between rome and 
naples on aug 31 1923 cipollone came to the united states at age 
15 with his mother and two sisters they lived in an italian 
section of new york citys east harlem 
he went to work in construction helping build the 1939 worlds 
fair grounds united nations and floyd bennett field a new york 
airport 
he met rose at an outdoor opera in the neighborhood when she 
asked him to move aside so she could see 
after marrying the couple moved to a larger apartment in the 
bronx and then a house in little ferry nj he worked for us 
steel from 1960 to 1979 splicing cables used to lift loads of 
steel he had his own cable business from 1978 until retiring in 
1986 
when the case ends which appears likely in late may or early 
june cipollone plans to enjoy the end of his daily court visits 
believe me for one week im going to stay home in the sun 
he said

staley contintental inc appears to 
be seeking a white knight to avert a proposed takeover by 
british sugar refiner tate amp lyle plc 
stley officials said monday they were negotiating with at least 
one other party interested in acquiring part or all of the company 
based in this northwest chicago surburb 
david satterfield a staley spokesman would not identify the 
parties 
the significance here is that weve commenced negotiations 
he said there is a significant difference between discussions 
and negotiations 
news of the negotiations confirmed reports last week that 
staley the countrys secondlargest refiner of corn syrup and a 
leading producer of foodservice supplies had discussed selling 
all or part of the company to third parties 
the company also said monday it would continue to explore other 
options to enhance shareholder values including a financial 
restructuring or recapitalization a joint venture or a leveraged 
buyout 
also monday staley officials announced two favorable court 
decisions upholding the validity of the companys 
shareholderrights plan and other measures taken to defend against 
the tate amp lyle takeover bid 
the plans validity was upheld by the delaware chancery court 
they said while the us district court in delaware upheld the 
constitutionality of the delaware takeover statute as it applies to 
staley and tate 
staley continental chairman donald e nordlund said he was 
pleased with the court rulings denying tate amp lyles requests for 
preliminary injunctions 
the rights plan is obviously serving a useful purpose in 
allowing the company to seek a more realistic offer nordlund 
said 
industry analysts have mentioned chicagobased kraft inc as a 
company that may have an interest in acquiring staleys cfs 
continental inc foodservice division staley defeated kraft in a 
bidding war for cfs continental in october 1984 
but several analysts contacted monday refused to speculate on 
which companies might be talking with staley 
ive seen the companys statement but i dont have any more 
information on that myself said clinton mayer iii an analyst in 
new york with bear stearns inc 
everything that can be said has been said said richard elam 
of blunt ellis amp loewi inc im just waiting for something to 
occur thats concrete and palpable and i dont know what its 
going to be 
staleys board of directors last week advised the companys 
shareholders to reject tate amp lyles second cash tender offer 
which totals about 142 billion or 35 a share 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange staley 
closed up 50 cents at 3875 monday 
analysts have said staley has a fair market value of about 40 a 
share 
londonbased tate amp lyle englands secondlargest sugar 
refiner owns about 5 percent of staleys stock and wants to 
acquire the entire company for its ae staley manufacturing co 
subsidiary which produces corn sweeteners 
staley was based in decatur ill until about three years ago 
when it moved its headquarters to the chicago suburbs 
the british company has promised to move staleys headquarters 
back to decatur if its takeover attempt succeeds

kansas city southern industries inc 
says it has asked the interstate commerce commission to authorize 
kcsi and not the denver rio grande western railway to acquire and 
operate the southern pacific transportation co 
the application was based on the belief that it would be in the 
best public interest for kcsi to own southern pacific said landon 
rowland president and chief executive officer of kcsi on monday 
santa fe southern pacific corporation has been required by the 
icc to divest the southern pacific because a merger between it and 
the santa fe railway would have essentially ended railroad 
competition in the southwest and other markets served by the two 
railroads rowland said 
santa fe southern pacific chose to sell the southern pacific 
to denver rio grande rather than to kansas city southern for what 
we believe to be purely anticompetitive reasons he said 
kcsis operating plan filed monday with the icc calls for the 
purchase of 547 modern locomotives over the next five years 
in contrast the philip f anschutz interests which control 
the denver rio grande appear to treat the acquisition as primarily 
a real estate play and propose to buy only 40 new locomotives over 
essentially the same period he said 
samuel r freeman the rio grandes vice president and general 
counsel said his company wouldnt neglect the southern pacific it 
would lease most new equipment instead of buying it to capitalize 
on financial and tax benefits freeman said 
the rio grande runs across about 1900 miles from kansas city 
to utah it hasnt revealed details for combining its small local 
work force with that of the southern pacific which has about 280 
employees 
monday was the deadline for comments about the southern 
pacifics proposed sale to be filed with regulators 
also opposing the deal were missouri gov john ashcroft and the 
missouri highway and transportation commission 
freeman said the rio grandes purchase was backed by most 
shippers regulators and other railroads 
the icc expects to rule in midaugust on the sale plan 
regulators last june killed santa fe southern pacifics efforts 
to merge the southern pacific with the rio grande railway which it 
also owns they feared that a merger of the two big lines whose 
tracks overlap in many areas would stifle competition and increase 
shipping rates 
early last year kansas city southern began a furious campaign to 
buy the southern pacific but the lobbying didnt prevent santa fe 
southern pacific from naming the rio grande as the railroads buyer 
in late december

mccormick amp co the worlds largest spice 
maker says it has reached an agreement with the federal trade 
commission allowing the company to proceed with its planned bid to 
purchase a west coast competitor 
legal obstacles stopping mccormick based in baltimore from 
acquiring the spice islands line of spices herbs and vinegars from 
specialty brands inc of san francisco for 56 million were 
lifted under the agreement made with the ftc last week mccormick 
said monday 
a decision from the ftc which reviews proposed mergers to 
determind how they will affect market share is expected later this 
month 
in april a federal judge granted a request by the ftc to stop 
the merger on the grounds that mccormick hadnt provided enough 
information to the agency to determine how the deal would affect 
competition in the 850 million spice and seasoning business 
mccormick then filed a suit against the ftc in us district 
court in baltimore saying it had given the agency more than 120000 
pages of documents and depositions from top executives 
mccormick spokesman mac barrett said the company has supplied an 
additional 10000 pages of documents

the department of trade and industry on tuesday 
cleared a 177 percent holding in cadbury schweppes plc by general 
cinema corp of the united states 
the clearance came in the form of a decision by the trade 
department not to refer the holding to the monopolies and mergers 
commission 
however the departments approval refers just to general 
cinemas current shareholding in cadbury a department spokeswoman 
said 
the matter could face further scrutiny by uk officials should 
general cinema increase its holding or make a full takeover bid for 
cadbury said the spokeswoman who was not identified in accordance 
with british custom 
cadburys share price bounded ahead 16 pence or 30 cents to 
334 pence or 628 per share by early afternoon on londons stock 
exchange on the news 
the chestnut hill massbased general cinema which has 
interests in movie theaters and soft drink bottling said late last 
month that it planned to increase its stake in cadbury schweppes 
and might try to acquire the british soft drink and candy maker 
chris milburn a director of investor relations at cadbury said 
he was heartened by the fact that the government could still 
initiate a monopolies panel investigation but he said tuesdays 
news nevertheless came as a disappointment 
cadbury chairman sir adrian cadbury last week called for the 
government to block foreign raids on the british confectionery 
industry 
swiss foods giant nestle sa has launched a 395 billion offer 
for another british confectioner rowntree plc in which competing

swiss car owners could be taxed on the 
distance they travel each year as a new incentive for combating 
pollution government experts say 
the idea was unveiled monday in a governmentordered study of 
possible alternatives to the current annual motor vehicle tax based 
on engine size 
mileage could be monitored with special counters connected to 
the axle costing about 300 swiss francs or 215 each the report 
by a panel of financial experts said sweden already uses such a 
system for diesel vehicles 
similar swiss measures are considered at least several years

it took ghanaian businesswoman 
esther a ocloo 30 years to pay off the bank debts for her food 
processing plant and with a little help she will be back in debt 
very soon 
ocloo is hoping local banks in ghana will approve a loan request 
of 1000 so she can expand her operation to fruit juices jam and 
canned fruit 
she is one of dozens of african entrepreneurs trying to grow 
with the help of the african project development facility apdf a 
yearold 72 million operation sponsored by the african 
development bank the international finance corporation and the 
united nations to help smaller african businesses obtain 
development financing 
scarcity is a fact of life in africa especially in terms of 
money for business people big or small getting the money to turn 
development ideas into reality is a major problem 
the development project accepts applications from small 
businesses with annual turnovers between 500000 and 5 million 
and ideas that have a chance for success it helps them prepare 
project feasibility studies for potential financiers the service 
is free of charge 
for four years kanga ballou an ivorian businessman had been 
trying to get his hands on a million dollars to start west africas 
first pencil factory he is very near to realizing that dream 
three out of four local banks have approved loan requests 
totaling 600000 an apdf feasibility study convinced the bankers 
of the profitability of ballous idea he says he and his seven 
partners can put up the rest of the funding 
the problem with people like me is that we dont have the 
money or knowledge to do these project proposals ballou said in 
an interview in his abidjan office for years i approached these 
banks by myself and i couldnt get an answer 
the reason he added was the banks could not afford the risk 
ballou wanted to use local wood to manufacture pencils for a 
market supplied by more expensive japanese and european imports 
the development project staff sent a wood sample to a european 
manufacturer for quality tests which were positive this was 
followed by a market study which discovered a healthy demand for 
cheaper pencils manufactured in africa by africans 
other west african entrepreneurs interviewed about the apdfs 
work said the service helped fill a void left by the collapse of 
african development banks in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
in ivory coast the worlds biggest producer of cocoa and a 
leading producer of coffee the most obvious example of this 
collapse is credit de la cote divoire an important local bank 
which has suspended its credit operations for businesses it was 
set up during the boom days in one of africas strongest economies 
most african countries are encumbered by severe economic 
restraints including high foreign debts falling prices for export 
goods and devastating droughts which have caused food shortages 
and mass starvation around the continent 
the job of business financing has been left to commercial banks 
which are not prepared to risk longterm financing on small 
businesses said andre cracco manager of the apdfs west african 
operations in abidjan 
they dont have the expertise and resources to appraise 
projects said cracco so they are careful maybe even too 
careful 
cracco and his colleagues do not contend the revival of small 
businesses is the solution to africas economic problems but its 
a start 
whats really exciting here is that we have a group of 
professionals who are sitting with african entrepreneurs and 
looking at projects from the african point of view said makarand 
dehejia a consultant to the apdf the results have been quite 
remarkable 
eight businesses in ivory coast kenya botswana and uganda have 
successfully obtained nearly 13 million from national and european 
creditors with the apdfs help it is working with creditors on 21 
other projects around africa from regional offices in abidjan and 
the kenyan capital of nairobi 
in 1987 the development project handled 600 applications 
accepting 10 percent cracco conceded many businesses were turned 
away but he stressed they were trying to help small businesses 
this has disqualified many applicants 
the development project staff considers 10 percent to be normal 
for the first year cracco said that after one year in operation 
the apdf is in the takeoff stage and will be in full operation 
by december 
many people submit unbankable ideas cracco added from 
the word go we have to put ourselves in the shoes of the bankers 
saliou ndione who owns pechazur a shrimp fishing and 
processing company in ivory coast said african businesses have a 
credibility problem he said few african businessmen have 
experience and the mistakes many made after african nations became 
independent have contributed to the continents economic problems 
ndione is building a new factory with a bank loan of 160 million 
west african francs 560000 he got with the help of the 
development project he wants to improve his product and broaden 
his sales in ivory coast and in west africa 
cracco said ndiones original ideas for expansion were more 
ambitious and risky and could have cost a great deal of time and 
money the marketing study prepared by cracco showed the market 
probably wouldnt support a huge increase in output plans for the 
new factory were tailored to the studys picture of market demand 
which impressed ndiones creditors 
the apdfs work was indispensable to us ndione said the 
bank took their study much more seriously than if we had done it 
ourselves

the remote hills of californias 
gold country are far from the sprawling urban jungle of silicon 
valley and thats just the way employees of the grass valley 
group like it 
a hightech company where almost everyone including top 
executives wears jeans and sneakers the grass valley group has 
been designing and manufacturing stateofthe art video production 
equipment for almost 25 years 
nestled in the hills outside of town gvg is by far the biggest 
private employer in an area where jobs in lumber and light industry 
can be hard to come by a sleepy former goldmining town with fewer 
than 9000 residents the streets are lined with quaint victorian 
homes some of which are opening as bed and breakfaststyle inns 
an annual bluegrass festival attracts hordes of tourists 
the views from gvgs international headquarters of wooded 
hillsides cows grazing and wide blue sky capture the feel of this 
decidedly rural area traversed by roads with names like squirrel 
creek fawn path and lime kiln road 
it is an unlikely spot for the design and manufacture of 
technology that helps bring you everything from monday night 
football to the glitzy graphics on the nightly news 
if a picture is worth a thousand words we give you a picture 
every sixteenth of a second said dan wright president of gvg a 
subsidiary of tektronix inc 
gvg has built its reputation on editing units and production 
switchers the behindthescenes equipment that controls things 
like which images go over the air during a live sportscast or when 
one image wipes or fades to another 
gvg is also a pioneer in the flashy video effects market its 
gvg equipment that made the olympics logo tumble across the screen 
during coverage of the winter games in calgary other popular 
effects can warp an image or give it a threedimensional look 
thanks to one gizmo television viewers can watch 
splitscreen action another called a kaleidescope can 
compress one of the split images so viewers can see an olympic 
skier at the top of a mountain while watching another zip for the 
finish line on the zanier side one of gvgs standard products 
enabled david letterman to broadcast his latenight show 
upsidedown one night 
and it was gvg wizardry that brought president reagans 1984 
landslide victory to video life as state after state was 
painted into the presidents corner 
it wasnt too long ago youd see the person turning the 
numbers by hand said wright now its all done with computers 
theyll just pack information into you now they couldnt do that 
10 years ago 
as their equipment has revolutionized what television looks 
like the company has introduced some innovations of its own 
located about 150 miles east of san francisco gvg has its own 
airplane to fly customers in and out of the remote wooded company 
headquarters a plus and minus when it comes to recruitment 
according to executive vice president dave mayfield 
designed to appeal to freethinking employees one company 
executive ventured to call them mavericks flextime schedules 
are available for most of the nearly 1000 workers in grass valley 
assemblers work in selfmanaged cells rather than production 
lines rotating jobs and setting their own production goals as an 
added incentive a profitsharing program was introduced in 1976 
a fitness trail winds its way through the 330acres of 
campuslike grounds and fleets of bright turquoise company bicycles 
are parked outside each of nine buildings to carry employees and 
visitors about the grounds 
part of engineer larry clicks job involves teaching customers 
how to operate their new equipment some of which looks so 
complicated that it has appeared as spaceship interiors in star 
wars and other hollywood features 
if a question comes up during a class and i dont know the 
answer click said ill just go over to building 9 where they 
design the stuff and ask them 
that sort of attention to detail appears to have been a founding 
philosophy of the grass valley group which was established in 
1959 its all part of what marketing manager bob johnson calls the 
culture of the company 
company lore has it that the founder dr donald gc hare was 
such an avid environmentalist that he took a twoweek vacation when 
trees had to be felled to make way for a new building he couldnt 
bear to hear the sound of the saws 
and if the habits of the freethinkers at gvg sometimes border 
on the eccentric so much the better 
one department is so adamantly unorthodox that if an outside 
salesman makes a call wearing a necktie hell more than likely 
lose it to a pair of scissors according to johnson 
although the company will not release earnings information 
officers will say they are in the midst of a 100acre expansion of 
their facilities in nearby nevada city much of gvgs competition 
comes from japanese companies like sony jvc and panasonic but 
ampex corporation of redwood city is a major competitor 
with their specialized equipment in television newsrooms and 
video production houses across the country gvg is now aiming 
lower in the marketplace toward smaller video production 
companies 
as more companies turn to inhouse videos for instruction and 
promotional purposes gvg plans scaleddown 10000 models of their 
premier 300000 production switcher 
each new generation of equipment offers more capabilities for 
less dollars said mayfield

a former guinness plc director lost an appeal 
tuesday of a court ruling that ordered him to repay a 98 million 
fee he received for work during the companys 1986 takeover of 
distillers co 
thomas ward a washington dc attorney had sought to 
overturn a 1987 high court ruling that declared unlawful the work 
agreement with former guinness chairman ernest saunders 
the 98 million payment had been made without the approval of 
the full guiness board 
in making its decision tuesday the three appeals court judges 
also ordered ward to pay guinness court costs and refused him the 
option of appealing to the house of lords the last recourse for 
appeals in the british legal system 
ward who didnt attend the appeal hearing had argued that any 
duty to disclose his interest in the agreement was met by his 
disclosure to a committee of directors consisting of saunders 
former guinness finance director olivier roux and himself 
but the court ruled that britains companies act required 
disclosure to a meeting of the directors and that the committee 
didnt meet that qualification 
saunders and six other men currently face multiple charges 
relating to alleged stock manipulation during the takeover of 
distillers a gin and whisky maker 
ward has not been charged but british police have issued a 
warrant for his arrest 
guinness has admitted that its former management arranged for 
the repurchase of guinness stock apparently to boost the share 
price and make guinness cashandstock offer more attractive than 
a rival bid

warner communications inc and lorimar 
telepictures corp said today they have agreed in principle for 
warner to acquire financially troubled lorimar in a stockswap 
transaction worth about 118 billion 
under the agreement between entertainment conglomerate warner 
and lorimar a major television producer 0415 warner common 
shares would be exchanged for each lorimar common share 
the deal puts a value of about 14 on each of lorimars 47 
million outstanding common shares for a total of around 630 
million in addition warner would assume lorimars debt of about 
550 million 
a merger between the two entertainment companies had been widely 
expected since they have been engaged in onagainoffagain merger 
talks since early march 
several conditions are attached to the deal for example 
lorimar would be able to terminate the agreement if the average 
price of warners common stock during the specified period before 
the closing of the merger doesnt result in a price of at least 15 
a share for lorimar shareholders 
in that event and in certain other circumstances warner would 
get a fee of 10 million from lorimar 
lorimar earlier rejected a 770 million or 17ashare 
takeover bid from denver investor marvin davis the former owner of 
twentieth century fox film corp davis who has indicated he may be 
willing to go higher wasnt immediately available for comment 
today 
lorimar told davis in midmarch that it would keep his offer in 
mind but lorimar spokesman ken lerer said today the company had no 
comment on whether that is still its position 
lorimar stock fell 125 cents to 13 a share in midday trading 
on the new york stock exchange while warner declined 75 cents to 
3287 
another condition of the deal gives new yorkbased warner an 
option to purchase 185 percent of lorimar common stock at 15 a 
share the option can be exercised if lorimar accepts a higher 
offer from a third party 
the agreement requires the approval of each companys board of 
directors lorimar shareholders and regulatory authorities under 
the deal lorimar chairman merv adelson would join warners board 
as vice chairman 
the acquisition of lorimar telepictures will expand 
warners already broad base of leadership in the entertainment 
industry warner chairman steven j ross said 
analysts have suggested that lorimars stock is worth between 
14 and 20 a share 
lorimar based in culver city calif is a leading producer of 
original television programming but in recent years has been 
troubled as its ambitious plans to expand into other areas 
disintegrated sometimes causing the company to incur losses or 
heavy costs that depressed its earnings 
lorimar produces such longrunning tv series as dallas 
knots landing peoples court and love connection it 
has 12 hours a week of primetime tv programming and 16 hours of 
syndicated programs 
for the first nine months of its current fiscal year lorimar 
posted a net loss of 826 million on revenue of 6168 million 
the loss included 45 million in writedowns on five movies and 22 
million in reserves for possible future losses in its homevideo 
subsidiary 
the company has replaced managements of both its movie and 
homevideo units 
in march several lorimar shareholders filed a class action 
lawsuit against the company in federal court alleging that lorimar 
overstated its income and net worth and did not reveal problems 
with its homevideo unit 
davis has been seeking to get back into the entertainment 
industry since he sold fox to media tycoon rupert murdoch in 1985 
for 575 million davis had owned fox for four years but the 
company was beset by persistent losses 
last year davis made an unsuccessful 3219 million bid for the 
906 percent he didnt already own of spectradyne inc the 
nations largest supplier of cable television and payperview 
movies for hotels

somalia on tuesday was added to the list of 
countries which may no longer borrow from the international 
monetary fund because of overdue repayments on previous loans 
the northeast african republic owes the fund about 37 million 
other countries on the list are vietnam liberia peru sierra 
leone guyana sudan and zambia 
the world bank owned by the same 151 countries as the fund has 
a similar list 
payments from the countries on it are so far behind that the 
bank is no longer entering payments from them on its books until it 
actually receives the money banks sometimes list payments to them 
on an accrual basis just because they are due regardless of 
whether the money has actually come in 
peru zambia sierra leone liberia and guyana are on this list 
as well as the imf list the bank also includes nicaragua syria 
and since last week panama 
the bank keeps a list of countries not normally published 
whose payments are 75 days overdue its practice is to suspend 
disbursements on loans to those countries sheldon rappaport a 
spokesman for the bank said that at the moment its two lists are 
identical 
the bank is the chief source of longterm aid loans to third 
world countries the funds basic job is to keep currencies stable 
often with the help of shorterterm loans in recent years its 
loans too have been going almost entirely to third world countries

daiwa securities co of japan has launched a 
25 billion mutual fund that will invest in us treasuries and 
corporate bonds setting a record for a new fund investing in the 
united states a report published tuesday said 
the wall street journal in tuesdays editions said the new 
fund could indicate that japanese investors have revived their 
enthusiasm for us bonds most of the investors in the fund are 
japanese financial institutions along with some individuals 
daiwa officials told the journal that the fund called new bond 
fund 88 was opened to participation last friday and attracted so 
many investors that it was oversubscribed and had to be closed on 
monday 
officials of the japanese investment firm didnt return 
telephone calls tuesday seeking confirmation of the fund launch 
the record amount to be invested by the daiwa fund surpasses the 
2 billion mfs intermediate income trust the largest comparable 
us fund according to thomas j herzfeld a specialist in mutual 
funds the mfs fund launched in early march also invests in us 
government and corporate bonds 
japanese investors were likely attracted to the daiwa fund by 
the current higher yields on us bonds compared with their 
japanese counterparts us treasuries are currently yielding rates 
of more than 9 percent while japanese government and corporate 
bonds yield around 4 percent 
chris ohmura an executive vice president of daiwa told the 
journal the new fund will seek even higher yields for investors by 
purchasing us company bonds though it wont buy highyield 
highrisk corporate junk bonds 
the new fund may do some buying at the treasurys quarterly 
refinancing auctions being held this week most likely in 
shorterterm issues ohmura said

in some of its largest companies and is hinting at moves to block 
incursions into british petroleum co plc and two big confectioners 
while the rumblings echo familiar patriotic strains the 
government says its concerns are strategic not protectionist 
the bp case for example involves the purchase of a major stake 
in the company by an opec member which could put the interests of 
british shareholders at risk the critics say 
they argue that the foreign raids on candy makers rowntree and 
cadbury schweppes are even more of a mismatch because the raiders 
themselves are protected against takeover reprisals 
in the bp case prime minister margaret thatchers government 
said the kuwaiti governments acquisition of a 22 percent stake in 
the oil giant warranted investigation because the arab nation 
belongs to the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
britain the worlds fifth largest oil producer is not a member 
of the cartel 
the conservative government has referred the matter to the 
monopolies and mergers commission to determine whether the 
acquisition is in the public interest according to trade secretary 
lord young 
the kuwaiti governments investment office in london maintains 
that its bp stake is a longterm investment and considers it has 
always acted as a model investor in bp 
it bought the stake piecemeal after the british government sold 
off its remaining 315 perent share of bp last fall 
meanwhile the office of fair trading which advises the trade 
secretary on whether to call in the monopolies commission is 
reviewing two swiss companies runs on kit katmaker rowntree plc 
noting that swiss law protects nestle sa and jacobs suchard 
sa from takeovers critics object to the lack of reciprocity 
kenneth clarke secretary of state for trade and industry said 
in response to a question in the house of commons on tuesday that 
reciprocity would be a key issue in the review 
the points being made about fairness are crucial clarke 
said 
john banham director general of the confederation of british 
industry britains largest industry group added we cant 
safely continue to play football against teams which have built 
brick walls against their own goals and expect to win 
swiss food giant nestle has launched a 21 billion pound 395 
billion takeover offer for rowntree and has bought an 11 percent 
stake in the company jacobs suchard has purchased a 299 percent 
holding in rowntree the maximum allowed under british takeover 
regulations short of a full takeover bid 
also at issue is general cinema corps purchase of a 177 
percent stake in cadbury schweppes plc the goverment said tuesday 
it would not go to the monopolies commission but warned that 
chestnut hill massbased general cinema could face further 
scrutiny if it goes ahead with plans to increase its stake 
critics complain that general cinema also is bidproof 
because some of its shareholders have limited voting rights and the 
state of delaware where the company is incorporated has passed 
antitakeover legislation 
young denied the government was becoming protectionist telling 
the observer newspaper if we start getting into protectionism 
we will be the ones to suffer most 
while mrs thatcher is a staunch advocate of free market 
policies and britain is an enthusiastic foreign investor it 
remains generally resistant to foreign investment 
this company is a national asset former rowntree chairman 
sir donald barron told applauding shareholders at their annual 
meeting late last month it is wrong that it should go to some 
inanimate place without tradition 
nestle chairman helmut maucher came to london this week to meet 
with members of parliament insisting rowntree would benefit if its 
products were marketed through nestles worldwide sales network 
asked by independent television news about the reciprocity 
issue he admitted that it was a barrier to takeover 
walter anderau a jacobs suchard vice president declined to 
comment tuesday 
the foreign suitors do have backers in britain some workers at 
rowntree said they believed nestle offered better job security and 
the conservative daily telegraph saw no economic justification 
for erecting barriers against foreign ownership of british 
companies and it would be unwise to try and do so at a time when 
britain is taking advantage of a cheap dollar to build up 
substantial investments across the atlantic 
on tuesday labor party member doug hoyle introduced a proposal 
which would give employees the right to consultation by their 
employer before a takeover but the bill stands little chance of 
becoming law because of pressure on parliamentary time

the international monetary funds managing 
director criticized commercial banks tuesday for not lending enough 
to third world nations 
michel camdessus addressing the city university business school 
in london said developing countries needed new loans to grow out 
of their debts 
he said the imf doesnt have the resources to provide such 
loans and although larger commercial banks do they havent shown 
enough willingnes to extend new credit 
the record is plain last year net bank lending to countries 
with debtservicing problems was negligible at best two years 
before it was negative camdessus said 
it isnt only the amount of financing that matters it is also 
the timeliness of financing and the attitude of the banks in 
responding to the indebted countries efforts and needs 
he added this inevitably sends the wrong signal to countries 
contemplating bolder efforts and it calls into question the notion 
that our strategy is a cooperative one oriented to growth 
camdessus noted that many indebted countries have made progress 
in adopting imfagreed programs but the former governor of the 
french central bank said the shift toward economic reform in the 
developing world risks being interrupted and even reversed 
because of doubts concerning the availability of financial 
support 
imf programs usually involve trimming government spending and 
reducing the size of the public sector loosening exchange rate and 
trade policy and encouraging exportled growth 
camdessus criticism of the conduct of commercial banks which 
are carrying billions of dollars worth of possible bad debts 
follows a sharper attack two weeks ago from david mulford 
assistant us treasury secretary 
mulford said the banks had taken a passive approach to debt 
crisis and he said that all major innovations for resolving the 
crisis had come from the debtor countries themselves 
commercial bankers have criticized the imf and many governments 
for refusing to grant easier repayment terms on their own loans to 
developing countries but have expected banks to take losses on 
their lending

bullish heading into a series of important agriculture department 
reports that were to be released after the close analysts said 
among the reports the most eagerly awaited figure was the

aug 31 the end of the soybean crop year 
the market was expecting the soybean number to be equal to or 
slightly lower than the usdas last estimate of 290 million 
bushels a figure lower than expected would give the soybean market 
impetus to move higher analysts said 
in its report the usda predicted the stockpile would total 275 
million bushels 
also released after the close were the usdas estimate of the 
1988 winter wheat crop 162 billion bushels vs 156 billion

pan am corp is in dismal financial condition and 
must get concessions from its labor unions before it can be pulled 
out of a financial tailspin new pan am chairman thomas plaskett 
told shareholders tuesday at the airlines annual meeting 
a teamsters union leader warned meanwhile that pan am will 
face a strike if no contract settlement is reached soon between the 
union and the airline 
we have urgent problems to solve weve been held in 
suspension pending the finalization of new contract arrangements 
with our unionrepresented employees plaskett said that is 
the first step on our road to recovery 
pan am the nations eighthlargest airline operates pan 
american world airways a northeast shuttle service and a commuter 
airline 
plaskett a former head of continental airlines who came to pan 
am in january as part of a major management shakeup at pan am 
outlined his strategy to stanch financial losses in the immediate 
future 
he called for expanding the carriers existing transatlantic and 
latin american routes and beefing up domestic routes so they feed 
more passengers to pan ams international flights 
plaskett stressed wage cuts and other labor concessions he said 
pan am must get from the teamsters the flight attendants union and 
the transport workers union 
the company has won 75 million in concessions from the two 
unions representing pilots and flight engineers plaskett said 
since the teamsters contract expired feb 21 pan am has 
imposed terms on the teamsters designed to save 35 million 
annually by cutting wages 8 percent and boosting productivity pan 
am also is asking for 27 million in annual savings from the 
transport workers union which represents mechanics and baggage 
handlers and 31 million from the flight attendants 
in return for the concessions the company is offering 21 
million in pan am stock with an additional 15 million shares to be 
issued to employees if specific profit targets are reached pan am 
stock traded tuesday at 275 a share on the new york stock 
exchange 
pan am which has debts of around 500 million posted a net 
loss of 262 million last year and 462 million in 1986 
in the first quarter of this year the company reported a net 
loss of 833 million narrowed from a loss of 936 million in the 
same period last year 
plaskett was sharply criticized by william genoese director of 
the national teamsters unions airline division 
at a news conference before the shareholders meeting genoese 
threatened that the teamsters would strike the airline if a fair 
agreement was not signed soon 
we can strike them at any time we can strike them over 
memorial day or the fourth of july genoese warned calling the 
date merely a matter of organization 
the teamsters represent more than 4000 reservations clerks and 
other ground personnel pan am has a total of around 28000 
employees 
pan am continues to lose money and will not regain its financial 
health until it has signed contracts with all five unions allowing 
the company to borrow money to recapitalize genoese said

the stock market closed mixed today failing to 
deliver a strong positive response to news that several major 
brokerages had suspended indexarbitrage trading for their own 
accounts 
both the dow jones industrial average and the overall market 
moved moderately higher early in the session only to shift into a 
gradual retreat before turning back upward just before the close 
jack baker head of block trading at shearson lehman hutton 
inc said the late bounce was due to some simple lastminute buy 
orders not index arbitrage trading 
analysts said the the rallys failure reflected the markets 
strong underlying bearishness 
salomon brothers inc morgan stanley co bear stearns co 
kidder peabody amp co and painewebber inc all issued announcements 
saying they planned to stop index arbitrage trading for their own 
accounts or had recently done so 
index arbitrage has been criticized as causing wide swings in 
the market scaring investors away and contributing to the markets 
inability to respond positively to favorable news about the economy 
meanwhile traders have been focusing on negative factors 
particularly recent signs of accelerating inflation 
in particular some analysts cited fears that interest rates 
might jump higher amid limited japanese participation the 
treasurys threeday auction of 26 billion in new bonds and notes 
which started today 
but in fact the bond market showed little response

the federal courts have upheld delawares 
takeover law for the second time in recent weeks further 
bolstering the ability of target companies to keep unwanted bidders 
at bay 
but because the judges opinions were issued in preliminary 
hearings and are subject to further consideration experts expect 
the law to be tested further 
an appeal is almost guaranteed said robert heim a partner 
in the philadelphia office of dechert price amp rhoads this is far 
from being conclusive 
a number of states have enacted antitakeover laws in recent 
years but delawares is regarded as especially significant because 
many of the nations biggest companies are incorporated there 
some 45 percent of the companies listed on the new york stock 
exchange are incorporated in the state and 56 percent of the 
fortune 500 industrial companies have opted to incorporate in 
delaware to take advantage of its liberal corporate and tax laws 
on monday us district judge jane roth upheld delawares 
3monthold law as it applies to tate amp lyle plcs hostile 142 
billion bid for staley continental inc 
and last month judge murray m schwartz said the law was most 
likely constitutional his ruling came in reponse to a challenge 
by bns inc a takeover company headed by british industrialist 
brian beazer which is pursuing a hostile 169 billion bid for 
koppers co 
both tate amp lyle and bns argued that the delaware law is 
unconstitutional because they say it conflicts somewhat with 
federal laws that govern tender offers and takeovers 
two previous challenges to the statute involving campeau 
corp which was attempting to acquire federated department stores 
inc and black amp decker corp in its bid for american standard 
inc never got to the review stage 
a key provision of the delaware law bars a potential buyer from 
acquiring a company for three years after the buyer accumulates 
more than 15 percent of the target companys stock the provision 
does not apply if the buyer acquires a total of 85 percent of the 
companys shares in the same transaction that it passes the 15 
percent threshold or if the board of directors supports the offer 
the provision is aimed at bustup deals in which a hostile 
buyer sells off chunks of a target company in order to help finance 
the buyout and partial offers under which the buyer acquires just 
enough shares to win control of the target and offers the remaining 
shareholders a lesser price for their stock 
tate amp lyles challenge was backed by the securities and 
exchange commission which filed a brief in support of the british 
firms motion 
some experts say the secs willingness to formally register its 
opposition to the law makes roths ruling particularly important 
it is quite significant because it shows that a federal court 
in charge principally of interpreting the constitution approved a 
state statute under attack by the sec said charles crompton 
an attorney with potter anderson amp corroon in wilmington 
crompton who represented both koppers and staley noted that 
the secs involvement was highly unusual and that the court likely 
would pay special attention to the position of a federal agency 
but others say that the secs support filed in a 
friendofthecourt brief bolsters tate amp lyles position so much 
that an appeal is inevitable even though the company has yet to 
announce its intentions 
heres a federal agency that comes in and says the law runs 
counter to the prinicples of the williams act which governs tender 
offers because it gives management too much power and therefore 
denies shareholders the ability to make an informed decision 
heim said it is certain to be reviewed 
while experts agree that the delaware statute is the most 
comprehensive and best crafted of the state statutes federal 
judges in other circuits are not bound by the rulings of district 
judges in delaware 
lawyers and interested parties and shareholders are going to 
be looking at what the courts of appeal do heim noted

american companies should avoid the lure of cheap 
soviet launches to send commercial payloads into space because of 
danger to us national security transportation secretary jim 
burnley told a meeting of space writers tuesday 
burnley said the soviet union is launching 10 times as many 
spaceloads as the united states annually but the us government 
wants to bridge the gap which widened after americas commercial 
program came to a halt following the 1986 explosion of the 
challenger space shuttle 
the soviets are taking clever advantage of our spacelaunch 
hiatus luring firms with their governmentfinanced launchings 
burnley said at the 50th aviationspace writers association 
conference 
i am opposed to allowing any us firm to use a soviet 
launcher regardless of whether the threat of technology transfer 
is posed he said 
the soviets who sent the first satellite into orbit in 1957 
have launched the most satellites into space of any country the 
soviets powerful booster rockets also can put into orbit heavier 
payloads than their western competitors 
in march the soviet union said it launched its first payload 
for a paying customer india a month earlier a massachusetts 
firm payload systems inc became the first us company to 
receive authorization to send an experiment aboard a soviet 
spacecraft 
the us commerce and state departments approved a twoyear 
agreement starting in 1989 to have soviet cosmonauts aboard the mir 
space station perform protein crystallization experiments for 
payload systems clients 
under the 1984 commercial space launch act the us 
transporation department defines and regulates commercial space 
efforts in 1986 the reagan administration announced that the 
space shuttle would no longer carry commercial or foreign 
satellites except for defenserelated missions 
the directive was designed to foster competition among private 
launchers and burnley said american companies have contracted to 
launch 14 satellites with reservations for 17 more eleven of the 
contracts are from foreign governments or international 
organizations 
meantime though the soviet union is seeking more us 
payloads burnley said 
i perceive a danger to our national security in the soviet 
enticement of launch contracts with their artificially low 
prices he said american companies are looking for inexpensive 
rides for their payloads 
if we ever allowed the american use of soviet launchers to 
become a pattern the soviets already mature launch capability 
would be further strengthened while our launch facilities could lie 
rotting on the ground 
burnley said he opposed the governments approval of payload 
systems soviet contract because paying the soviet union with 
us hard currency to help them build a launch capacity that could 
be used against us our allies in wartime is unwise

stock prices closed slightly higher tuesday 
little affected by news that several major brokerages had suspended 
indexarbitrage trading for their own accounts in attempt to curb 
volatility and woo frightened investors back to the market 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials settled at 200365 up 
630 points 
gainers edged out decliners on the new york stock exchange with 
745 up 713 down and 507 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 1312 million shares compared 
with 16632 million on monday 
the session started off with moderate gains after the first of 
what grew to five brokerages announced that they were suspending 
indexarbitrage trading or had recently done so 
index arbitrage takes place when traders using computers play 
off differences between futures contracts and their underlying 
baskets of stocks 
it has been criticized as causing wide swings in the market 
scaring investors away and contributing to the markets recent 
inability to respond positively to favorable news about the economy 
analysts said the moves by salomon brothers inc morgan 
stanley co bear stearns co kidder peabody amp co and 
painewebber inc could have been sufficient to spark a strong 
updraft had the will been there 
but apparently it wasnt 
by early afternoon the rally was eroding away and had turned 
to an overall loss with less than an hour to go only a lastminute 
spate of ordinary buy orders turned the tide said jack baker head 
of block trading at shearson lehman hutton inc 
if the market really had a chance to go up this should have 
been a real opportunity for the bulls to shake rattle and roll 
said alfred e goldman a vice president at the ag edwards amp sons 
inc in st louis but the rally was less than puny from minus 
2 points in the dow to 13 on the upside 
what it says is the overall trend is down he added 
eugene peroni director of technical research at the janney 
montgomery scott inc securities firm in philadelphia said he 
belived the market was still floundering 
it has no focal point most investors are very insecure 
theres no confidence the sentiment is very bearish theres

with airline traffic on the rise the nation needs 
to build more airports hire more traffic controllers and modernize 
equipment to avoid hellish delays airline industry officials 
said tuesday 
in the heavily traveled corridors and the heavily traveled 
airports the system is becoming incapable of handling the 
traffic said daniel m kasper director of transportation at 
harbridge house inc a boston consulting firm 
over the next three years i think we are going to see some 
hellish delays developing kasper said in a panel discussion at 
the 50th annual aviationspace writers association conference 
airline travel has been on the rise since the industry was 
deregulated in 1978 according to federal aviation administration 
figures 450 million people rode regularly scheduled commercial 
airline flights last year and officials project 600 million 
passengers a year by the early 1990s 
weve just got to get more capacity to handle the load said 
stephen d hayes a vice president of the air transport assocation 
of america 
the longterm prospects are not good unless we can 
significantly increase airport capacity in the country he said 
we have had explosive growth in air transportation in recent 
years but the capacity of the system has not grown 
the number of publicuse airports in the country fell for the 
15th straight year in 1987 to 5723 from 5775 the previous year 
hayes said 
the last major airport built in the united states was 
dallasfort worth international in 1974 and denver is the only 
city currently planning to build a new airport 
part of the problem has been local opposition to new airports 
because of airplane noise air pollution and ground traffic in 
some cities residents have succeeded in forcing airports to reduce 
operting hours and restrict the types of airplanes permitted to 
land experts said 
nobody wants an airport in his or her backyard kasper said 
adding that airlines have been forced to tailor their schedules to 
meet local desires 
defending airlines current ontime performance hayes said 788 
percent of flights on the 14 largest american carriers were on time 
in march up from 747 percent a month earlier 
he said consumer complaints fell 21 percent in april from the 
previous month and that mishandled baggage declined to 75 reports 
per 1000 passengers in march compared to 87 in february and 118 
in january

soybean futures prices bounded higher for the fourth straight 
session tuesday and analysts said an agriculture department 
forecast of a steep drop in us stockpiles would keep the rally 
from faltering 
on other markets grain futures were mixed precious metals 
advanced livestock meat and energy futures were mixed and 
stockindex futures advanced 
the may soybean contract on the chicago board of trade has 
gained 21 cents a bushel in less than a week primarily on fears 
that this springs dry weather foreshadows a hot dry growing 
season 
the soybean market has been particularly sensitive to weather 
worries since a usda report last month predicted the nations 
soybean stockpile would total a relatively low 290 million bushels 
on aug 31 the end of the current crop year if that prediction 
were correct a poor harvest this fall could lead to tight supplies 
of soybeans next year 
the usda released a new report tuesday afternoon revising its 
1988 soybean carryout estimate to an even lower 275 million 
bushels the usda also predicted a 1989 carryout of just 145 
million bushels well below market estimates of 150 million to 200 
million bushels 
analysts said the numbers were bullish and futures prices likely 
would rise again wednesday morning 
i think beans will be at least a nickel and probably more 
towards a dime higher and we could go higher than that said 
victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter reynolds inc 
but cathy leow an assistant vice president and soybean analyst 
at thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york noted that the 
usda numbers were based on farmer surveys conducted before planting 
even began 
soybean futures prices have risen more than 50 cents a bushel 
since the usdas march 31 planting intentions report and ms leow 
said the higher prices probably persuaded farmers to plant more 
soybeans 
the odds are that soybean acreage will be higher and next 
years soybean ending stocks will also be higher she said 
lespinasse agreed but still predicted soybean futures prices 
would rise sharply on wednesday 
the usda also estimated the 1988 winter wheat harvest at 162 
billion bushels up 4 percent from last years harvest and well 
above the average market estimate of 158 billion bushels the 
agency predicted a sharp drop in wheat stockpiles however which 
could offset the negative market impact of the high yield estimate 
the usda estimated the 1988 corn carryout at 411 billion 
bushels and the 1989 corn carryout at 339 billion bushels which 
analysts termed neutral for corn futures 
in trading tuesday wheat settled 1 cents to 3 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in may at 303 a bushel corn was 
cent to cents lower with may at 199 a bushel oats were 2 
cents to 3 cents higher with mayat 161 a bushel soybeans were 
5 cents to 7 cents higher with may at 705 a bushel 
silver futures led the precious metals complex higher in what 
analysts described as followthrough buying after mondays strong 
finish 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold settled 280 to 4 
higher with june at 45160 a troy ounce silver was 10 cents to 
112 cents higher with may at 657 a troy ounce 
livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
cattles performance suggested early positioning ahead of the 
usdas next cattleonfeed report which is due out on monday 
analysts said 
gains in the pork markets linked to steady cash hog prices were 
limited by a softening wholesale pork market said chuck levitt an 
analyst in chicago with shearson lehman hutton inc 
cattle settled 10 cent lower to 30 cent higher with june 
unchanged at 7280 cents a pound feeder cattle were 60 cent lower 
to 15 cent higher with may at 8020 cents a pound live hogs were 
22 cent lower to 10 cent higher with june at 5145 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 23 cent lower to 38 cent higher with may 
at 5132 cents a pound 
oil prices finished mixed on the new york mercantile exchange in 
a second day of featureless trading 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 8 
cents higher with june at 1746 a barrel heating oil was 04 cent 
lower to 16 cent higher with june at 4774 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 15 cent lower to 12 cent higher with june 
at 5162 cents a gallon 
stockindex futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange 
where the contract for june delivery of the standard amp poors 500

lossplagued lorimar telepictures corp 
agreed tuesday to be acquired by warner communications inc in a 
118 billion stockswap deal that adds a top television producer 
to warners movieandmusic empire 
a merger between the two entertainment companies had been widely 
expected since they have been engaged in onagainoffagain merger 
talks since early march 
lorimar produces such popular network television series as 
dallas knots landing and alf as well as a strong 
lineup of shows that are syndicated or sold directly to individual 
stations 
equally important analysts said are lorimars expected 
revenues from future syndication of shows it has produced new 
yorkbased warner produces such primetime series as night 
court and spenser for hire but is stronger in the movie and 
record businesses 
we saw a terriffic fit said lorimar chairman merv adelson 
who would retain daytoday control for the time being i think 
theres a tremendous upside in warner stock for our shareholders 
the agreement expected to close in september calls for 0415 
warner common shares to be exchanged for each lorimar common share 
the deal puts a value of about 14 on each of lorimars 47 
million outstanding common shares for a total of around 630 
million in addition warner would assume lorimars debt of about 
550 million 
lorimar retains the right to walk away if the merger doesnt 
bring its stockholders at least 15 per share which means warners 
stock price must average 36 per share 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange tuesday 
warner fell 75 cents a share to close at 3287 lorimar fell 37 
cents to close at 1275 a share on the american stock exchange 
among other conditions attached to the deal lorimar would be 
required to pay warner 10 million if the deal is cancelled if 
lorimar accepts a higher offer from another party warner would 
have an option to buy 185 percent of lorimar for 15 a share 
though long a television powerhouse lorimar in recent years has 
been troubled as its ambitious plans to expand into movies and 
homevideos disintegrated sometimes causing the company to incur 
losses or heavy costs that depressed its earnings 
for the first nine months of its current fiscal year lorimar 
posted a net loss of 826 million on revenue of 6168 million 
the loss included 45 million in writedowns on five movies and 22 
million in reserves for possible future losses in its homevideo 
subsidiary 
lorimar earlier rejected a 770 million or 17ashare 
takeover bid from denver investor marvin davis the former owner of 
twentieth century fox film corp davis who has indicated he may be 
willing to go higher could not be reached for comment tuesday 
but adelson dismissed speculation that davis might sweeten his 
bid saying lorimar had never been interested in a merger other 
than the stock swap negotiated with warner 
the acquisition of lorimar telepictures will expand 
warners already broad base of leadership in the entertainment 
industry said warner chairman steven j ross 
the merger would team two highprofile show business executives 
in ross and adelson who is married to television interviewer 
barbara walters 
steve and i have known each other for a long time and we see 
eyetoeye on most things adelson said we both see ourselves 
as entrepreneurial human beings 
the lorimar name staff and culver city headquarters will be 
retained for television production said warner spokesman geoff 
holmes but he declined to discuss the future of lorimars movie or 
homevideo units 
lorimar produces 12 hours of weekly primetime tv programming 
and 16 hours of syndicated programs while warner produces five 
hours a week of network shows 
lorimar also owns the former mgm movie lot in culver city which 
reportedly is worth as much as 200 million

american telephone amp telegraph co is asking 
federal regulators for new flexibility in setting rates for 
business customers to allow the company to compete with discounts 
offered by other longdistance companies 
the new ratesetting method would allow industry leader atampt to 
offer special rate plans to individual businesses that already have 
been offered discount pricing by competing longdistance carriers 
we need to be able to respond to these competitive 
situations larry garfinkel atampt vice president for marketing 
services said tuesday customers would be deprived of the 
benefits of competition if all carriers cannot compete on an equal 
basis 
under federal regulations atampts rates are generally available 
to all customers other longdistance companies whose prices are 
not regulated can tailor their prices for an individual company 
in a filing with the federal communications commission late 
monday atampt said its new ratesetting proposal was prompted by mci 
communications corps discount offering to holiday corp of 
memphis tenn the nations largest hotel chain with more than 
1800 affiliate and franchise hotel properties 
atampt wants to offer pricing discounts to holiday corp 
competitive with mcis proposed plan 
garfinkel said the atampt proposal is absolutely not 
deregulation since the fcc will continue its oversight of atampts 
rates and profits he also said the company will not set prices for 
special packages below cost 
mci said it will oppose atampts proposal as unlawful the 
secondlargest longdistance carrier said the plan would allow atampt 
to ignore longstanding safeguards designed to protect the 
public from predatory pricing and discrimination by any company 
that controls a large share of the market as atampt does providing 
about 72 percent of the countrys longdistance service 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the timing of the companys 
proposal was coincidental to the fccs preparations this week for 
another step toward radically changing the way atampt is regulated 
the fcc on thursday is expected to unveil a specific proposal to 
put in place a new system of regulating atampt by capping rates 
rather than profits atampt has been lobbying hard for the change

western union corp chairman bennett s le bow 
said tuesday he has agreed to help plan and finance a friendly 
takeover of the financially troubled consumer products company 
allegheny international inc 
le bow said would cooperate with a committee of equity 
investors one of several groups involved in the chapter 11 
reorganization of allegheny the parent of sunbeam and oster 
appliances 
the attempt here is to forge and create as much value for the 
shareholders as possible said tim lang a partner in spear 
leeds amp kellog a new york brokerage id say this company has 
done a pretty good job of destroying it 
spear leeds amp kellogg holds 480400 shares or 20 percent of 
allegheny internationals 1125 convertible preferred stock and 
112900 shares or 4 percent of the companys preference stock 
and is one of the key players in the bankruptcy case 
the equity committee is waging a proxy contest with management 
for control of the board of directors 
le bow said a preliminary analysis of allegheny international 
shows he could offer a plan that would make stock in the company 
worth more than its present market value 
allegheny internationals board of directors excluding the 
dissidents nominees on tuesday urged shareholders to oppose the 
dissidents attempt to solicit proxies to elect a majority of the 
board at the annual shareholders meeting 
allegheny international said previously that while it did not 
start the proxy fight it intended to win the contest could be 
decided at a may 20 shareholders meeting although unsecured 
creditors have asked us bankruptcy judge joseph cosetti to cancel 
the meeting 
management in resisting the preferred shareholders cited 
record sales and earnings in its ongoing consumer products 
businesses during the six months ended march 27 sales rose 14 
percent to 511 million and operating earnings grew 48 percent to 
505 million 
le bow said spear leeds amp kellog has granted him options on 
allegheny international shares to encourage him to help formulate 
and finance a plan of reorganization he expressed confidence in 
obtaining the financing 
allegheny international sought protection from its creditors 
under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws on feb 20 and has 
since been working on a reorganization plan any proposal though 
would need the approval of allegheny internationals board 
shareholders creditors and the bankruptcy court

media general inc said tuesday that its 
board of directors would not consider a sweetened 2 billion 
takeover bid from los angeles investor burg sugarman 
the company also urged shareholders to spurn sugarmans efforts 
to have himself dallas billionaire harold simmons and david 
gotterer vice chairman of two sugarman companies elected to media 
generals 10member board through a proxy fight 
the companys annual meeting is set for may 20 
in a letter to shareholders media general president james s 
evans said our commitment is to the best interest of our 
shareholder we dont believe those interests are at all served by 
the likes of messrs sugar simmons gotterer as represented by 
their statements and past actions 
we vigorously oppose their election to the companys board 
media general had said monday the board would review sugarmans 
sweetened 70ashare cash bid but he noted the companys major 
shareholder the family of chairman d tennant bryan remained 
opposed to the proposal 
sugarman originally offered 6150 a share or around 16 
billion 
the bryan family owns 71 percent of media generals 559168 
class b shares while sugarman controls 10 percent of media 
generals 28 million class a shares 
like several media companies media general has two classes of 
stock to keep control of the company in the hands of a few while 
there are fewer class b shares outstanding those shares are more 
powerful than the class a shares 
two weeks ago us district judge richard l williams ruled 
sugarmans original offer would have to be approved by twothirds 
of each class of stockholders who must vote separately 
sugarmans attorney who promised to appeal had argued that 
media generals charter allowed a simple majority decision by a 
combined vote of shareholders representing the companys two 
classes of stock 
media general attorneys successfully contended that voting 
provision applied to acquisitions made by media general not to a 
concern trying to acquire it 
media general is the parent company of richmond newspapers inc 
publishers of the richmondtimes dispatch and the richmond 
newsleader the company also holds other newspaper interests and 
owns several television stations

mazda motor corps assembly plant 
which builds the new ford probe and the mazda mx6 nearly has 
finished hiring and has begun training workers for the second 
shift company officials said tuesday 
when the second shift begins production in june the 550 
million plant will employ nearly 3000 assembly and 400 salaried 
workers mazda spokesman jim gill said the plant began building 
cars in september 
by august when it reaches full production the plant will be 
completing 240000 cars a year more than 60 percent of them will 
be probes built for ford motor co to be sold through the ford 
division 
but until then fords 4500 dealers will have to settle for a 
small trickle of the sporty twodoor hatchbacks which they say are 
in such demand they are moving at premium prices 
probes official introduction is thursday as a 1989 model but 
dealers have had them for several months ford division general 
manager thomas wagner said the plants probe production is sold out 
through october 
whatever we get we sell immediately we cant keep them 
said irma elder owner of troy ford 
its a good buy its sporty wellpriced economical to 
drive what more can you ask since february people have been 
coming in asking for probe 
unfortunately elder said she doesnt get many the first one 
was sold as soon as she got it so she had to convince the buyer to 
let her keep it in the showroom for four weeks so other customers 
could see it 
john blackwell iii executive vice president of blackwell ford 
inc in plymouth said customers are paying oversticker prices to 
get the forddesigned cars which have been engineered and built by 
mazda 
both dealers said the frontwheeldrive probe fills a void in 
fords lineup and will not replace the popular rearwheeldrive 
mustang 
elder and blackwell were among several members of the ford 
dealer council who toured the hightech mazda plant on tuesday 
ford owns 25 percent of mazda and the plant sits on the site of 
fords defunct michigan casting facility 
the highly automated factory includes the final assembly plant 
plastics shop paint shop and metalstamping plant it uses robots 
throughout even to perform tasks such as putting the spare tire in 
the trunk 
it also boasts some ideas not found in other us assembly 
plants such as a hanging conveyor tilted at a 30degree angle 
making it easier for workers to attach parts to the cars 
underbodies

the panel of experts created to solve the 
governments budget woes convened for its first public meeting 
tuesday with a pledge that it would finish its work ahead of 
schedule 
but many members of the national economic commission quickly 
realized it will be no easy task to master the arcane details of 
federal budget writing 
former transportation secretary drew lewis now head of union 
pacific corp and washington lawyer robert strauss the 
cochairmen of the 12member commission both said the panel was 
committed to solving the budget problem in a bipartisan way after 
considering all possible solutions 
lewis announced that the panel in an earlier closeddoor session 
had agreed to an accelerated schedule under which its 
recommendations would be completed and released on dec 21 more 
than two months ahead of the deadline called for by law 
both strauss and lewis previously had indicated that the march 
1 1989 deadline set by congress for the commissions final report 
would be too late to influence the next presidents critical first 
budget request to congress which he traditionally makes soon after 
taking office in january 
at the first meeting witnesses explained how the budget process 
was supposed to work but some members of the panel had trouble 
following the technical language 
in opening remarks lewis said the commission was united in its 
belief that america cannot continue to outspend its income if we 
want to continue this nations dominant position in the world 
what we require in dealing with this problem is some true 
statesmanship a placing of the common good above all others 
lewis said we owe that to the generations that will follow us 
our children and grandchildren have a right to live and work in an 
environment that will not be subject to periodic unpredictable 
economic jolts 
strauss said the commission would be involved in an educational 
process over the next six months trying to establish a common 
factual base from which we can make informed decisions 
among the witnesses who testified tuesday was stanley collender 
director of federal budget policy for the accounting firm of touche 
ross amp co 
collender urged the commission to scrap the current deficit 
targets set in the grammrudman deficit reduction law collender 
said the average 36 billion per year reduction in the budget 
deficit which last year totaled 1514 billion were phony more 
of a publicity stunt than a serious deficit maximum 
he said that reaching a balanced budget by 1993 as called for 
under the current law was very doubtful he said yearly deficit 
reductions of between 15 billion and 20 billion would be more 
realistic 
the commissions 12 members were appointed by president reagan 
and leaders of the house and senate another two members will be 
added by the presidentelect after the nov 8 election 
then if things go according to plan the dealmaking will start 
in earnest with the decisions forming the basis for the new 
presidents first budget to congress 
supporters of the expert panel approach believe that congress 
protected by the political cover from the commission will swallow 
hard and vote to cut popular programs and raise enough taxes to 
finally solve the deficit problem 
everyone for years has known the solution to the deficit 
problem you either raise taxes or you cut spending said william 
dunkelberg dean of the business school at temple university if 
the commission provides the mechanism for doing the hard things 
that have to be done but allows members of congress as individuals 
to duck the blame then it might work 
the white house predicts the budget deficit for fiscal 1988 will 
be 1467 billion the congressional budget office however 
estimates it will be about 157 billion the national debt 
currently is about 25 trillion 
the idea for a bipartisan commission to deal with the deficit 
problem was advanced by new york gov mario cuomo and sponsored in 
congress by sens bob dole rkan and patrick moynihan dny 
both dole and moynihan served on the last successful economic 
panel the social security commission chaired by alan greenspan 
which in 1983 came up with a bailout plan to put the ailing 
benefits system back on its feet 
observers are betting that strauss a washington attorney and 
former us trade representative and lewis former transportation 
secretary and now head of union pacific corp will have the 
negotiating skills needed to bring off a similar success this time 
around 
in addition to strauss and moynihan other democratic members of 
the economic commission are rep william gray chairman of the 
house budget committee lee iacocca chairman of chrysler corp 
lane kirkland president of the aflcio and felix rohatyn partner 
with the new york investment firm lazard freres 
in addition to lewis other republican members of the commission 
are caspar w weinberger former defense secretary in the reagan 
administration donald rumsfeld former defense secretary in the 
ford administration sen pete domenici ranking republican on the 
senate budget committee rep bill frenzel rminn a member of 
the house ways and means committee and dean kleckner a rudd 
iowa farmer and president of the american farm bureau federation
