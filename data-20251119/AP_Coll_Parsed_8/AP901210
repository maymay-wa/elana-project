paris is the venue for many strategy sessions 
dedicated to the defense and promotion of the french language but 
this one had a distinctively american accent 
there was virgil benoit of red lake falls minn who noted that 
the motto on his state flag was letoile du nord the northern 
star 
there was randolph lineham a lawyer from long beach calif 
whose ancestors emigrated in 1870 when prussia annexed the alsace 
region and there was floyd satterlee of indianapolis with no 
french connection other than a love of the language and culture 
they were among 45 delegates from 20 states representing the 
estimated 15 million frenchspeaking us citizens who gathered 
in paris last week to assess the prospects for the language of 
voltaire in the land of french toast and french fries 
the bestknown frenchspeakers in the united states are likely 
louisianas nearly 600000 cajuns but there are frenchspeaking 
communities from maine to the pacific conference delegates said 
lineham said speaking french has been considered chic in certain 
california circles for a long time the francophone community there 
continues to grow with the arrival of immigrants from the former 
french colonies of cambodia and vietnam 
more than half the delegates in paris were professors 
normand beaupre a university teacher and writer from biddeford 
maine still remembers when francoamericans were called the 
chinese of the east because many of them worked in new england 
textile mills 
we were told speak american he said 
beaupre 55 says its no longer a liability to be a 
frenchspeaking american 
i have my own identity he said i am not a quebecer nor 
a frenchman nor a cajun i am a francoamerican 
the 1980 census registered 13 million americans of french 
origin the first french arrived at the end of the 16th century 
and france lost its last territory in the presentday us with the 
louisiana purchase in 1803 
the threeday meeting was organized by a french association 
formed 13 years ago to strengthen ties with frenchspeaking 
americans the french foreign ministry and paris mayors office 
provided part of the funding 
at the close of the conference delegates voted to seek improved 
teaching of french at us schools promote frenchoriented local 
festivals and push for a greater availability of tv programs and 
written material in french 
after the second generation the french language is very often 
lost by the children beaupre said we need a new strategy and 
this is to link with the international francophone movement rather 
than staying alone in each state

diane evans parents had four sons and two 
daughters it was diane who went to war 
no place in vietnam was safe the former army nurse recalls 
we were in a combat zone and we were subject to attack 
it saddens her that two decades later america still is coming 
to grips with the prospect that women may die in war alongside men 
if there is a war in the persian gulf for the first time in 
history american women may be injured or killed in significant 
numbers 
the pentagon wont say how many women serve among the 240000 
us troops in the gulf only that they comprise somewhat less of 
the gulf contingent than their 11 percent share of the overall us 
military 
images of women soldiers feature prominently in news reports 
from saudi arabia and the role played by women has expanded 
allowing them to serve in a whole range of support positions that 
were off limits in days past many argue that makes them more 
vulnerable if fighting breaks out 
although women dont fill combat positions the roles that 
they are serving in will expose them to hostile fire said 
meredith neizer head of the defense advisory committee on women in 
the service 
no one is sure how the nation would respond to female 
casualties 
after all weve said about how far women have come americans 
are not ready to have their women go out there and get maimed and 
killed in combat said bill taylor of the center for strategic 
and international studies 
taylor said the number of women killed or injured in a gulf war 
probably would be low because women dont serve in tank and armored 
infantry units 
but even the possibility of casualties among women is generating 
debate about the expanding role of women in the military and the 
accompanying risks 
theres been a wakeup call on what wartime military duty might 
entail said martin binkin a military analyst with the brookings 
institution theres less discussion about scrapping the militarys 
ban on women in combat jobs he said 
women are barred by law from serving on combat sips and planes 
in the navy air force and marines the army bars them from serving 
in combatrelated fields such as infantry tank and some artillery 
units but women serve in many of the support and supply units that 
could be caught in battle 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo is pushing legislation to 
require a fouryear test to see how women would perform in 
combatrelated jobs she argues that excluding women from combat 
jobs doesnt insulate them from danger but it does deny them career 
advancement opportunities 
women she says often handle the communications for maneuvers 
and communications centers are considered prime targets for attack 
women would be the first hit in a strike schroeder said 
she rejects arguments that americans arent ready to see women 
wounded or killed female police officers face lifethreatening 
dangers daily she notes and a few women came home in body 
bags from both world war ii and vietnam she said 
eight women nurses and more than 58000 men died in vietnam 
more than 200 women and more than 400000 men died in world war ii 
retired air force brig gen wilma vaught president of the 
women in the military service of america foundation believes the 
public has overcome any special qualms about the wartime loss of 
women vs men 
weve progressed far from where we were she said people 
dont want their women killed any more than they want their men 
killed theyd like for them all to live 
and yet binkin cautions you still have many people with 
traditional views that war is not a place for women 
the question of women in combat is a very emotional issue and 
it could very well be reopened by the gulf operation he said 
some critics believe the public has been conditioned to accept 
the expanding role of women in the military and the risk they could 
die in war 
weve become numbed to a point said brian mitchell author 
of the weak link a book critical of the feminization of 
the military 
weve had enough propaganda about how great this is that women 
can go over there and fight and die like men he said the 
american public has been conditioned to think that this is just 
the way things are nowadays 
a new york timescbs news poll taken in january 1990 after 
military women served ably in the us invasion of panama found 
that seven of 10 americans thought women should be allowed to serve 
in combat units if they wished 
opinion could quickly shift if hostilities result in images of 
women returning to us soil in caskets binkin said 
if we get into a combat situation that brings home the point 
of what war is all about you might get different answers he 
said 
for diane evans the army nurse who served in vietnam the key 
to accepting the risks that women face in todays military lies in 
acknowledging their contributions in past conflicts she directs 
the vietnam womens memorial project 
we could have casualties in the gulf even before we have a 
memorial built to women who died in the last war ms evans said 
we want the women who go off to the next one to know they will 
not be forgotten

the next presidential campaign will likely 
feature a fiery debate over affirmative action but one party will 
call it simple justice the other will label it unfair quotas and 
voters will have to decide whom to believe 
sen jesse helms rode to reelection in north carolina after 
accusing his black challenger democrat harvey gantt of supporting 
racial quotas and while some denounced the tactic others detected 
a way to bolster the identity and electoral strength of the 
republican party 
helms came from 13 points behind to win comfortably i think 
solely on this issue said gop consultant roger stone it is 
the kind of cutting social issue that conservatives need to hold 
onto the white house 
a number of recent developments suggest voters may be hearing a 
lot more about affirmative action and racial quotas between now and 
november 1992 
democratic congressional leaders have renewed their pledge to 
once again pass a civil rights bill that president bush branded a 
quota bill and vetoed in the last congress 
virginia gov doug wilder the only democrat blatantly testing 
the 1992 presidential waters blasted bushs characterization of 
the bill and said it gave helms phony ammunition i know what 
racial quotas are i have experienced them firsthand wilder who 
is black said in a letter to bush 
william bennett the new republican party chairman defended 
helms use of the quota issue and said he was ready to debate 
affirmative action if the democrats bring it up most americans 
are troubled by racial preference programs he said 
rep richard gephardt the house democratic leader chided 
bennett for his remarks in a speech last week and charged that 
ideologues on the right are following a new trail of racial 
resentment and recrimination blazed by louisiana state legislator 
david duke 
disaffected democrats at a conservative forum predicted doom 
for their party unless more moderate voices are heard until we 
give up fear and discuss these issues rationally and logically we 
are going to continue to lose said former new york mayor ed 
koch 
prominent democrats say their party has a sound position but 
others have distorted it 
i dont know what there is to redefine said party chairman 
ron brown who is black the democratic party and its chairman in 
particular vehemently oppose quotas we vehemently oppose anything 
that could lead to reverse discrimination the legislation that the 
democratic congress sent forward to the president was not a quota 
bill it was supported by a number of conservative republicans 
but the democrats including gantt himself acknowledge that 
they havent communicated well with voters many of whom equate 
affirmative action with quotas as stone noted harvey gantt ran 
up and down north carolina saying he wasnt for quotas but nobody 
believed him 
working against the democrats is a feeling among some voters 
that the civil rights agenda of the 1960s has been fulfilled that 
affirmative action was supposed to be temporary and smallscale and 
has outlived its time 
but gantt said hundreds of years of discrimination cannot be 
remedied in two decades thats not even one generation he 
said we need to do it and we need to remove the stigma that 
were going to discriminate against whites or were going to 
promote blacks who arent qualified none of that is true 
many democrats maintain the heart of the matter is economics 
they say republicans want to divert attention from the recession 
and the whole idea of affirmative action is more threatening now 
because jobs are scarce 
this issue is about a shrinking economic pie and people 
thinking someones going to give their slice to somebody else 
said democratic strategist mike mccurry 
you have to recast the debate to show the republicans are 
trying to peddle fear instead of a plan to get the economy going 
and you have to have an answer for the working person who fears for 
his job he added you have to say my plan is to develop a 
redhot economy so we all have jobs 
republican analyst doug bailey thinks his party too should 
look at the big picture he said it would be a big political 
mistake to lean heavily on affirmative action to fill the void 
left by the end of the cold war and the splintering of the gop on 
abortion and taxes 
it turns off a large corps of moderate voters northern 
suburban voters who have supported the republican party in the 
past bailey said they will not want to see a party 
intentionally choose an issue even though it may have some merit 
which divides people on racial lines 
however stone said the theme would appeal to a group that is 
equally if not more important to the party bluecollar reagan 
democrats and he maintained it could be pursued without the gop 
appearing to be insensitive or divisive 
you can use other issues to illustrate your desire for 
economic growth in the minority community stone said go out 
and campaign against quotas but for enterprise zones and greater 
financial assistance for minority education 
but the democrats firmly believe they hold the higher ground on 
civil rights and can persuade voters of that foreshadowing the 
rhetoric to come wilder has accused bush of failing to provide 
moral leadership and brown called his veto of the civil rights bill 
a disgrace 
he had an important choice to make the party chairman said 
and he chose the politics of jesse helms and david duke rather 
than the politics of martin luther king and abraham lincoln

the worlds largest corporation has inherited most 
of what once was east germany with instructions to sell it off or 
close it down 
detlev rohwedder the chairman is running the sale of the 
century converting the state companies of former east germany to 
private enterprise and says he wants to do it with consideration 
for the people who might be hurt 
he is from west germany but a native of thuringia one of 
germanys five new eastern states 
i think its great to be asked by my government to be part of 
the effort rohwedder said after agreeing in early november to 
take a full fouryear term as chairman of treuhand 
the incorporated agency whose name means trust was established 
by the east german government last spring when it still was trying 
to preserve state enterprises westerners moved into the management 
later and rohwedder became chairman in august 
treuhands mandate is to sell as much as possible to private 
owners and deliver the proceeds to the national treasury it is 
empowered to close inefficient operations or divide large ones and 
sell or close the parts separately 
it has ordered all the former east german enterprises to submit 
balance sheets for analysis 
rohwedder a 58yearold lawyer had long experience in the west 
german government and was credited with the rescue from 
nearbankruptcy of the hoesch steel company 
his trust corporation is responsible for 45 million to 6 
million employees and owns 60 percent of eastern germanys forests 
35 percent of the arable land factories housing and other real 
estate 
it will take until next spring to count the employees and 
estimate what the assets are worth rohwedder said by 
midnovember the trust said it had taken in 15 billion marks 1 
billion from the sale of state companies 
although the east german economy was considered in bad shape 
its output in 1989 was estimated at the equivalent of 290 billion 
west german marks 187 billion 
real estate will be especially difficult to sell some of it was 
seized from people living in west germany or jews who fled the 
nazis many of whom have filed claims for restitution that may be 
in the courts for years 
wolf schoede spokesman for treuhand said it was the largest 
corporation in the world and it has no precedent and there will be 
no successor 
most commentators say chancellor helmut kohl could not have 
found a person with better qualifications than rohwedder to run it 
but treuhand has taken a lot of criticism in its short life 
in its nov 12 issue the weekly magazine spiegel declared that 
rohwedder was unapproachable and had quickly shown the door to 
heinz ruhnau head of the national airline lufthansa who wanted to 
buy the east german airline interflug 
foreign companies say treuhand is almost impossible to contact 
its procedures are not clear and it favors german investors 
tom sommerlatte vice president in germany of the usbased 
consulting firm arthur d little said he had contracts with 12 
east german companies that wanted to form ventures with foreign 
firms 
we have tried very hard to talk to treuhand and convince them 
of solutions we have found sommerlatte said sometimes they 
didnt even receive us we couldnt get an appointment 
when the point was raised during a meeting with foreign 
journalists rohwedder sighed and said they probably were the 
2087th call we had that day we have a small number of people 
here too few to accommodate the questions 
treuhands staff doubled in october to about 500 and will grow 
to 12001500 by the middle of 1991 rohwedder said it has 
offices in 15 cities of eastern germany and headquarters on the 
alexanderplatz the center of east berlin 
its attitude is to favor entrepreneurs and foster competition 
the chairman said that he added was why he backed away from 
lufthansas attempt to lock up almost all domestic german air 
traffic by buying interflug 
the unpleasant side of the job is to close companies whose 
products wont sell in western markets rohwedder said he had heard 
criticism that treuhand was too slow in shutting some factories and 
explained his approach this way 
we could make unemployment very fast and it would take a long 
time to get back to work we have to work with love for the 
people 
he denied favoring german applicants over foreigners 
german economic policy is to be open to the outside world 
he said it stiffens competition makes people work harder and 
benefits the consumer 
rohwedder acknowledge that germans have the inside track because 
many west german companies had good business ties with east 
germany about 90 percent of the first 200 deals were with german 
firms 
the game is played in germany so its only natural the 
germans play the greatest role he said 
foreign hotel chains were interested in building in many places 
he said but that brought up the awkward problem of land ownership 
we dont know if we own this corner in east berlin or a jewish 
family that was expelled in 1938 
in dresden 130 miles south of berlin a long street of grimy 
factories contains two examples of treuhands work 
pentacon a company that made praktica cameras without regard 
for costs to show that east germany could build an internationally 
accepted product is closing and about 5000 people will be out of 
work 
cigarettes however are a thriving business philip morris 
bought the dresden factories of the old east german tobacco company 
and is turning out 50 million cigarettes a day 
it has guaranteed the jobs of all 945 workers through 1992 
increased production 30 percent and raised wages 100 a month to an 
average 1050 still less than half what the company pays its 
workers in western germany

it involves just one newspaper and fewer than 
2500 workers but to organized labor which has stumbled from one 
debacle to another in the last decade the daily news strike has 
the feel of a last stand 
these days every strike like this one seems to be about the 
survival of the union movement said james green professor of 
labor studies at the university of massachusettsboston union 
people ask themselves if we lose another one why are unorganized 
workers going to join a union 
and they ask themselves if we cant win in new york where can 
we win 
new york city is so damn important to the american union 
movement said aflcio spokesman rex hardesty in washington 
like they say everything else is hoboken 
with about 40 percent of its work force organized new york is 
one of the few big cities that can still pass for a union town 
the news strike began oct 25 after a paper handler who was 
working while seated refused a supervisors order to stand up 
saying he needed to sit down because of a physical disability when 
other workers walked out in sympathy the company hired permanent 
replacements within 24 hours nine unions were on strike 
since then management has been more successful at producing a 
newspaper than distributing it most newsstand dealers refuse to 
sell the news usually because of striker appeals threats or 
outright violence 
circulation has dropped from a millionplus to about 500000 
and many leading advertisers have pulled out including department 
stores such as macys and alexanders 
the news battle comes at a crucial period in us labor history 
union members a majority of the work force 40 years ago now 
account for less than 20 percent the last decade was marked by a 
series of embarrassing defeats or costly standoffs 
against this background the news dispute is variously described 
as labors alamo or its waterloo 
certain strikes rise to national attention and become symbolic 
strikes says ronald filippelli editor of an encyclopedia on 
labor strife they become much more important than the number of 
people involved 
local strike leaders have welcomed the attention juan gonzales 
a news columnist calls the strike a decisive battle between 
labor and management in the united states the labor movement 
is drawing a line in the sand this trend of breaking unions is 
going to stop here 
the aflcio has four staffers working in new york and gave the 
news unions 100000 for an advertising and reader boycott campaign 
directed by samuel mcknight a veteran labor lawyer from michigan 
at a rally nov 14 outside the daily news building leaders of 
some of the nations top unions promised the strikers about 
300000 and local unions have pledged 2 million 
if national interest has raised the stakes in the strike some 
wonder if it might also influence the way the strike is conducted 
when management hires replacement workers once a relatively 
rare tactic albeit a legal one unions are reacting with unusual 
bitterness according to filippelli 
in labor disputes such as those at the daily news eastern and 
greyhound a message is being sent to unionized employers that 
unions might be willing to take a company down if replacement 
workers are used he said 
ester fuchs a barnard college professor who specializes in 
urban politics questions such tactics 
because of the boycott the unions are going to be blamed 
rightfully or wrongfully if the paper closes she said 
she also wonders if unions should focus national attention on 
this particular strike if they lose under these circumstances 
people will ask how they can win anywhere else if they win its 
not a cue for anyone elsewhere because the conditions in new york 
are so special 
strike organizers challenge that assessment mcknight the labor 
lawyer said strikes are won by hurting the employer economically 
said filippelli the boycott is aimed at getting a 
settlement and i dont think anyone wants to drive the news out of 
business 
indeed the aflcios hardesty said the strike can showcase 
labors ability to work with management he points to the new york 
post a rival tabloid where unions made extensive wageandhour 
concessions earlier this year 
wed like to say to employers we know we can go down with 
you wed like to go up with you he said

egypt gets to write off billions of dollars in 
debt syria gains more control over lebanon china lands a 50 
million loan the soviet union wins help restructuring its economy 
nations that have joined the usled effort against iraq by 
sending troops to the gulf or agreeing to abstain in a key united 
nations vote are getting a little something in return 
and those who havent may find it a little more difficult to get 
expected aid from the united states and other countries 
in the world of diplomacy there is nothing unusual about a 
little exchange of favors which diplomats call quid pro quo 
but analysts say iraqs invasion of kuwait is pushing 
international politicking to new extremes including highlevel 
us contacts with nations it has accused of supporting terrorism 
syria cuba and soon iraq itself 
altruism and principle do not always make the world go 
round said michael mandelbaum eastwest studies director for 
the council on foreign relations expecting something for your 
support is normal predictable understandable behavior in 
diplomacy and politics 
its difficult to draw a direct link between cooperation in the 
gulf and increased aid some of the benefits such as egyptian debt 
relief and help for the soviets may have come anyway but maybe 
not so expeditiously 
and not all of the aid is coming from the united states 
but washingtons attitude toward a country can make a 
difference 
for example the bush administration called on other wealthy 
countries to help jordan only after king hussein said he would 
apply full sanctions against neighboring iraq 
and after yemen voted against a ussponsored resolution 
authorizing the use of force against iraqi president saddam 
hussein the state department began reviewing american aid to that 
country 
a department source who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
said yemens chance of getting 30 million was now not as strong 
as it might have been 
about twodozen nations are sending troops ships planes or 
other support for the military buildup against saddams 
millionmember army 
other countries have balked at sending troops germany and 
japan cite prohibitions in their constitutions but are helping 
those who do and those who suffer most that also helps keep the 
fragile alliance together 
the us force in the persian gulf is expected to reach 400000 
soldiers in the next few weeks the secondlargest force 144500 
troops is from the area most directly threatened by iraqs 
occupation of kuwait the gulf cooperation council nations of saudi 
arabia bahrain oman united arab emirates qatar and the exiled 
kuwaiti regime 
egypt has pledged 20000 soldiers along with tanks and heavy 
artillery syria which borders iraq to the west has 6500 
soldiers in saudi arabia and a 15000member armored division is to 
be added 
for spearheading arab support egypt is being rewarded in 
washington with a writeoff of 67 billion in loans used to buy 
arms from the united states 
even before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait us officials 
were looking for a way to relieve egypts financial burden but 
egypts cooperation helped sell the debtforgiveness plan to 
congress 
pakistan has pledged to send 5000 troops to the persian gulf 
and another 5000 serve as advisers with the saudi military 
saudi arabia the united arab emirates and the kuwaiti regime 
are lending about 500 million to pakistan to help compensate for 
oil imports cut off by the gulf crisis according to kuwaiti 
officials 
analysts agree that the soviet union has made clear it wants 
some economic assistance for its support of the saudius 
position 
its an important signal that the soviets voted for the united 
nations sanctions against iraq said jim phillips an analyst for 
the conservative heritage foundation i think they expect food 
aid its a hazy quid pro quo but the soviets are counting on us 
goodwill down the line 
the soviets so far have committed only warships but indicate 
they would send ground forces under a un command in return 
saudi arabia and other arab nations aligned against iraq reportedly 
are putting together a multibilliondollar loan package for moscow 
other countries sending troops include britain with 30000 
france with 13000 morocco with 1200 and bangladesh with 
2000 
the support from some nations has been bare bones and clearly 
aimed more at showing the flag in an international operation and 
warming relations with the united states than seriously aiding the 
military effort 
italy the netherlands spain australia argentina canada 
greece denmark norway and portugal all have sent ships to the 
gulf but have stopped short of committing significant ground 
forces 
new zealand which has been at odds with washington since the 
wellington government banned nuclearpower submarines in 1984 
pledged two planes and a medical team 
other countries receiving or looking for more us aid also are 
kicking in token support czechoslovakia is sending a 200man army 
unit and poland a military field hospital the philippines is 
putting together a medical team 
for china it was enough just not to say no 
during backstage negotiations leading up to the security 
councils vote allowing military action the asian development bank 
granted china a 50 million agricultural loan it was the first 
loan by the usinfluenced bank to beijing since the june 1989 
crackdown on student demonstrators 
china which could have stopped the resolution with its veto 
abstained when the council voted the day after the loan was 
announced 
then chinese foreign minister qian qichen was welcomed in 
washington for meetings with bush and his aides ending an 18month 
ban on highlevel contacts with china 
chinese officials denied that they used the un veto power to 
gain political favors and bank officials refused to comment on 
whether the loan was linked to the un resolution

a year after police put 51 vietnamese on a 
plane to hanoi in the only forced repatriation of boat people 
pressure is mounting to resume the controversial policy 
british colonial officials say forced repatriation eventually 
will be seen as the only way to clear hong kongs squalid camps of 
tens of thousands of refugees whatever the international outcry 
that accompanies it 
if hong kong resumes the policy united nations officials 
predict other countries in the region will follow suit returning 
more than 100000 vietnamese who crowd camps throughout asia 
once back in vietnam no one can protect the wouldbe refugees 
from persecution the united nations which monitors boat people 
who return voluntarily says it can do nothing to help those who 
are forced to return because it opposes the policy 
early next year the government will consider lifting a 
moratorium imposed on mandatory repatriation said clinton leeks 
hong kongs refugee coordinator 
its really our only option he said in an interview 
leeks said western governments are not taking enough of the 
genuine refugees and the number of boat people deemed to be 
nonrefugees or economic migrants is growing 
human rights lawyers say they look to the united states the 
sole remaining western country actively opposed to forcing 
vietnamese home as a last line of defense 
the us is the only thing that stands between the boat people 
and prison planes or prison ships back to vietnam said david j 
clark a law professor at the university of hong kong who has 
studied the boat people problem 
american officials insist that us opposition to forced 
repatriation remains staunch but analysts agree that washingtons 
policy is linked to its refusal to normalize relations with 
vietnam 
if vietnam helps organize elections in cambodia and participates 
in settling the cambodian civil war us diplomats say the united 
states may recognize hanoi by 1992 
the next day look for forced repatriation a us official 
said on condition of anonymity 
in the camps of tin huts concrete and watchtowers the 
prospects are depressing to hong kongs 52171 boat people 
wed rather die that go back to vietnam reads a sign stuck 
on a chainlink fence at whitehead detention center the biggest of 
hong kongs 15 camps 
a yearend report by a western consulate predicted riots and 
bloodshed in the camps if the dec 12 1989 forced repatriation is 
repeated 
the americans should know what kind of resistance the people 
from north vietnam are capable of mounting a police official 
said 
a un official who works in the camps said he believes the 
vietnamese know they are fighting a losing battle 
forced repatriation could become unnecessary he said if the 
vietnamese realize they have no place to go but home un 
officials have begun telling the refugees since october they should 
return home a radical break with previous policy 
since the vietnam war ended in 1975 more than 15 million 
vietnamese have fled since the vietnam war ended in april 1975 the 
united states has accepted almost 1 million indochinese refugees 
about three times the total of the next three countries 
australia canada and france 
as a place of first refuge hong kong has borne the brunt of the 
exodus 162479 arrivals since 1979 but the numbers are declining 
only 6201 boat people have arrived so far this year compared 
with 34114 in 1989 resettlements rose to 7152 a 50 percent 
increase from 1989 
hope for a solution increased in september when vietnam the 
united nations and britain signed an agreement creating a new 
category of boat people those who do not oppose repatriation 
to supplement voluntary repatriation 
interest in the new category appears low however only 23 
vietnamese were in the first group to return dec 1 although 111 
had signed up interest in the voluntary program also is lagging 
although the total number of vietnamese in hong kong declined by 
several thousand over the last year the decrease has been among 
boat people who already had been granted refugee status and a 
chance to settle in the west 
people who await screening on their qualifications as refugees 
plus those who flunked the process have increased from 43702 in 
1989 to 43949 as of dec 3 also 2684 babies were born in the 
camps giving the boat people one of the highest birth rates in the 
world 
these increases are intolerable leeks said what happens 
if theres another mass exodus next year

israel has stopped pumping water from the sea 
of galilee and the river jordan has become a dirty brown stream 
palestinians often are lucky to get a drip when they turn on the 
faucet 
israel is suffering a drought which in the middle east means 
much more than not being able to sprinkle the lawn 
water is another of the regions many crises extending beyond 
israel to turkey syria jordan and iraq water is inseparable from 
israels conflict with the arabs and especially the palestinians 
in the occupied territories 
agriculture minister rafael eitan has run fullpage newspaper 
ads warning israelis their country would lose nearly 60 percent of 
its water if it gave up the occupied west bank 
water is an extremely scarce resource in israel the ads 
say in fact it is in many ways the limiting factor on the 
countrys future development 
as thousands of soviet immigrants pour in monthly with 1 
million expected by the end of 1992 everyone fears a shortage 
palestinians see israels handling of water as another attempt 
to drive them from the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
water is a final solution to the palestinian problem said 
saeb erakat a professor of political science at annajah 
university in the west bank denying palestinians water means 
get out 
erakat turned on the tap at his home in jericho an oasis city 
since ancient times a few drops trickled out and he said no 
water no life 
eitan calls israels dwindling water sources a potential 
catastrophe 
on nov 25 israel stopped pumping water from the sea of 
galilee which supplies about a quarter of its drinking water the 
sea had dropped to within two inches of the level where more 
pumping could turn it into a salt lake 
reports say the countrys underground water also is near the 
danger level 
predictions are for a late plentiful rainfall this winter but 
november ended without significant rainfall a group of rabbis even 
held a special prayer for rain 
the gaza strip has more serious problems than the west bank or 
israel open sewers in crowded refugee camps drain into its only 
water source an aquifer nearly destroyed by overuse israel 
already pumping water in for the few thousand jewish settlers and 
750000 arabs in gaza 
in the long run eitan talks of importing water from turkey or 
eastern europe and building desalination plants 
the reserve army general leads the rightwing tsomet party 
which wants to make the occupied lands part of israel giving up 
control of the west bank is basically giving up control of the 
entire water system said martin sherman one of his advisers 
water from an underground mountain reservoir that straddles the 
west bank and israel now is divided 8020 in israels favor the 
government says this is justified under international law based on 
population figures before israel captured the territory in the 1967 
middle east war 
onequarter of all israels water comes from the reservoir the 
ad placed by eitans ministry said another aquifer that provides 
onethird of the supply would would be affected if a palestinian 
state was created in the west bank 
erakat said 30 percent less arable land is irrigated now than 
before 1967 reducing the economic output of the west bank by more 
than 25 percent 
shehadeh h dajani manager of the arab development society in 
jericho used a large map on the wall of his office to point out 
land that was irrigated before the occupation 
this is something they have gained after 1967 and they dont 
only control the land but our water from heaven dajani said 
israel has denied taking water that should go to palestinians 
according to government statistics israelis use twice as much 
water per person as palestinians a government conservation 
campaign has had little effect and farmers have stymied efforts to 
raise the subsidized price of water for agriculture 
as the crisis gets worse sherman said the government will have 
to decide who gets water and how much 
leftwing legislator dedi zucker said water is the deciding 
factor in the palestinianisrael conflict it will either force 
us to cooperate with one another or to kill one another by 
thirst he said 
neighboring jordan and syria have water disputes with israel 
i would tell the world if you want to limit the tension in 
the middle east dont send tanks and dont confuse us with 
fruitless talks eitan said send water and that will cool down 
the middle east 
in oja a village outside jericho mubarak alnujoum pointed to 
fields overgrown with brush and blamed his water shortage on a 
nearby jewish settlement that even has a swimming pool 
he said more than half his 25acre farm which supports an 
extended family of 17 people no longer is irrigated he still 
raises tomatoes cucumbers and corn but has stopped growing 
bananas because they need too much water 
alnujoum threw a pebble into an irrigation pond which he said 
was only onethird its normal depth 
these whirls of water are the rings of war here he said

the danes who claim the worlds 
record in parliamentary elections reluctantly vote again 
wednesday and the hottest issue seems to be who provoked the 
unwanted balloting 
conservative prime minister poul schlueter blames an economic 
dispute with the opposition for forcing his election call 
even he reflects the countrys lack of enthusiasm for its 20th 
general parliamentary vote in 45 years shlueter says he wants to 
get it over with as soon as possible 
denmark has one of the worlds most fractured democracies it 
has not had a majority government since 1971 longer than any other 
pluralistic system 
schlueter whose centerright coalition controls just 67 seats 
in the 179seat parliament has called four elections since 1982 
the latest campaign lacks the trappings seen in those held most 
other countries 
there are no mass rallies in the streets the size and placement 
of campaign posters is severely restricted by law paid political 
spots are not accepted on state radio or on the two public tv 
channels 
yet turnout among denmarks 39million electorate averaging 85 
percent since 1945 is among the worlds best 
thirteen parties ranging from marxists to antitax crusaders are 
competing for the vote with just 2 percent of the vote needed for 
representation many gain seats and have emerged as kingmakers 
between the evenly balanced main parties 
political scientist steen sauerberg says many danish follow 
the liberal ideal of giving the little guy a chance too 
another reason for the frequent votes he says is because there 
are no fixed terms for parliamentarians although there is a 
fouryear maximum 
schlueter whose coalition includes the liberals and social 
liberals called the vote to settle a minor dispute with the main 
opposition social democrats on economic policy and taxes 
both sides wanted a 6 percent cut at the top of the progressive 
tax scale but the social democrats opposed financing it with 
reductions in social benefits 
unlike in the neighboring scandinavian countries of sweden and 
norway the two main political blocs in denmark have remained 
evenly balanced neither the left nor right has managed to get a 
working majority said sauerberg 
this allows the small parties often to hold the balance of power 
in the parliament he added 
but danish politics despite its surface chaos remains 
surprisingly stable 
the voters tend to stay loyal to their party and support for 
the parties swings only a few percentage points after each 
election said sauerberg 
all 13 parties get equal time on tv to present their political 
platforms regardless of their current strength they also 
participate in a series of debates among all the parties at once 
the basic flaw in the current campaigns says sauerberg is that 
the politicians spend more time speculating openly about possible 
coalitions than they do discussing the traditional issues of 
employment taxes and welfare 
so why do the danes keep voting 
simply because of the danes sense of duty towards society and 
the fact that voter registration is automatic you get a card in 
the mail sauerberg said

with thousands of troops deployed for 
operation desert shield many are looking to increase their life 
insurance coverage before they go that has proven difficult 
in the same way casualty companies wont write hurricane 
coverage when a storm has formed many life insurance companies are 
inserting war exclusion provisions in new policies 
they say if you are killed in a war the policy is no good 
said ic russell of the south carolina insurance department 
the department has received calls from concerned servicemen and 
women but theres no mandate by law that says any insurance 
company must write you a policy if they dont want to russell 
said 
the washingtonbased american council of life insurance has no 
specific numbers on how many companies are putting in exclusions 
but it seems many companies are issuing the war exclusion 
clauses for military who have been called to the persian gulf 
said spokeswoman diane coffey 
the council is a trade group representing about 600 companies 
nationwide 
coffey said policies issued after aug 2 when iraq invaded 
kuwait could include clauses that would stipulate the full 
policy would not be paid if death occurred as a result of war in 
the persian gulf 
policies issued earlier without the exclusion cant be amended 
to exclude deaths in a gulf war she said 
coffey urged military personnel to shop around because 
basically each insurance company decides 
one insurance company with mostly military customers is the 
united services automobile association based in san antonio of 
the companys 2 million policyholders about 95 percent are active 
duty officers 
the companys new policies dont have war exclusions but they 
do limit the amount of new coverage said spokesman john walmsley 
officers from lieutenant through captain may buy new or 
additional coverage up to a maximum of 250000 he said higher 
ranks may buy new or additional coverage up to a maximum 350000 
for enlisted personnel the cap is 10000 
we frankly felt the escalating tensions in the middle east 
needed a prudent business decision walmsley said 
business has increased since the crisis began walmsley said 
but he couldnt say exactly how much 
all troops including reservists called to active duty may get 
coverage through the servicemens group life insurance program 
administered by the federal government 
the government contracts with private companies for the 
coverage said betty nahdil an administrator in the benefits 
directors office of the veterans administration 
more than 99 percent of service personnel buy the coverage 
which provides a death benefit of 50000 
any military operation not withstanding they can get this 
coverage she said the fact that we are in the gulf is not 
increasing the number of policies we are issuing except among the 
reservists who are offered the opportunity 
she said 44 claims have been paid for troops killed in accidents 
since the gulf buildup began fifty soldiers have died since the 
deployment began

a wave of fatal shootings numerous 
burglaries and drug trafficking have persuaded some people to hold 
onto their weapons despite a ban on firearms in richmonds public 
housing 
id rather be safe than sorry said sondra davis 30 who 
lives with her 11 and 12yearold daughters in the hillside court 
housing project 
us district judge richard l williams ruled dec 3 that the 
gun ban inserted into leases by the city housing authority in 
october was part of a goodfaith effort to improve the safety and 
quality of life in public housing 
the ruling marked the first time a judge has upheld a gun ban in 
public housing in the united states according to the national 
rifle association a chicago ban on guns in public housing has not 
been challenged in court 
ms davis said she wont be deterred by the rule under which 
violators can be evicted 
instead of dying or one of my kids getting hurt id just have 
to find another place to live she said im not selling drugs 
im just keeping a gun in my house for my protection 
the richmond tenants organization had challenged the ban as an 
unreasonable lease restriction that made the citys 14000 public 
housing residents secondclass citizens 
alma barlow president of the tenants group said her group has 
not decided whether to appeal 
some residents of the citys 4500 public housing units said the 
ban is a good idea if it helps reduce crime they said they often 
hear shooting at night and have either been burglarized or seen 
people breaking into homes 
its all right with me said lena austin 55 as she hung 
laundry outside her hillside court home they need to really 
buckle down 
it will probably stop more killing around here said latoya 
james 18 who lives in the blackwell complex 
about a third of richmonds record 111 slayings this year 
occurred in the seven housing projects said officer stephen v 
york who compiles crime statistics for the police department many 
of richmonds slayings were drugrelated richmond had 98 slayings 
in all of 1989 
nearly 300 burglaries have been reported this year in public 
housing york said 
im scared to go out said william loney 70 of hillside 
court he said he was thinking about getting a gun that he keeps at 
a relatives house 
ill probably do it anyway because if they say i cant keep 
guns theyre responsible for my life

cancer death rates in industrialized nations are 
rising faster than aging and smoking might account for heightening 
suspicion that pollution and other environmental dangers are at 
fault scientists say 
cancer causes about 23 million of the 11 million deaths 
annually in industrialized nations according to one of an 
international set of reports collected and published by the new 
york academy of sciences 
when lung cancer most often caused by smoking is excluded 
the cancer death rate among men in industrialized nations has risen 
9 percent since 1950 the report said cancer death rates for women 
have risen in some countries and fallen in others it said 
cancer is increasing in industrial countries above and beyond 
that due to cigarette smoking or aging alone said devra lee 
davis an editor of a collection of studies and a researcher at the 
national academy of sciences in washington 
the combination of air pollution and industrial activity is 
obviously a very important factor 
brain cancer is among the most rapidly increasing davis said 
especially among people over 65 in some cases the rate in the 
industrial world has increased more than sixfold in those over age 
75 she said such cancer has also increased among young people 
although at a lower rate she said 
research shows that in the united states the rate of lung 
cancer deaths among nonsmoking women is now higher than the total 
lung cancer death rate in women 30 years ago she said 
that could reflect exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke as 
well as to radon asbestos and air pollution davis said 
according to national cancer institute figures the lung cancer 
death rate among all american women in 1955 was 51 deaths per 
100000 women davis and her collaborators calculated that the 
death rate in women nonsmokers by 1985 was 61 per 100000 
sharp increases are also occurring in a blood cancer called 
multiple myeloma and the dangerous skin cancer called melanoma 
davis said the rates are climbing in many industrial nations 
including the united states 
in italy cesare maltoni and colleagues at the bologna institute 
of oncology found that cancer causes nearly 40 percent of all 
deaths in the bologna area and the rate continues to climb thats 
double the rate for the rest of the country bologna is in the most 
industrialized part of italy 
the changes are so great over such a short time in so many 
countries in men and women that we need to look carefully for their 
causes davis said these could be very important as clues for 
prevention 
although the studies emphasize occupational and environmental 
exposures smoking remains one of the greatest causes of cancer 
davis said 
in many industrial countries smoking is responsible for 40 
percent of all cancer deaths in men and 30 percent in women the 
studies show 
smoking kills an estimted 3 million people each year around the 
world and if current trends continue that will climb to more than 
10 million by 2020 davis said the combined population of the 
industrialized countries studied is about 12 billion 
the studies are collected in trends in cancer mortality in 
industrial countries which will be released this week 
although the increases in cancer are clear the causes are not 
davis said links to benzene pcbs and other environmental 
carcinogens are being considered 
among other possible factors she said are a genetic 
predisposition to cancer lifestyle including drinking and 
smoking the consumption of anticancer foods like fresh fruits and 
vegetables exposure to xrays and infectious agents and a variety 
of occupational hazards

as residents of little middletown ny brace 
for a slowing economy agencies serving the poor in the hudson 
river valley community expect more and more people will need help 
to pay fuel bills rent and even find shelter 
but they dont expect to get the money theyll need from the 
federal government 
there will be people wanting services we just wont be able to 
accommodate charles darden executive director of middletowns 
regional economic community action program lamented recently 
with the end of the cold war last year and before the us 
involvement in the persian gulf some lawmakers argued that excess 
money from a slimmeddown pentagon the socalled peace dividend 
should be used to expand domestic programs 
instead the money will be used mostly to chip away at the 
federal deficit and strict budget procedures written by congress 
and president bush will keep it that way for at least three years 
advocates of these priorities and the new rules say they are 
necessary to trim the budget deficit which is expected to reach at 
least a record 320 billion in fiscal 1991 which began oct 1 
if we dont deal with the deficit we wont be able to deal 
with any of our other priorities said house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo an architect of the fiveyear budget 
package 
robert greenstein executive director of the center for budget 
and policy priorities which lobbies for lowincome programs in 
washington criticized the plan 
the problem is not only do we not invest more in domestic 
programs but we dont even give ourselves over the next three 
years the ability to debate the issue he said 
as part of this falls big budget deal congressional leaders 
and the white house set firm ceilings for each of the next three 
years for three separate categories of spending defense and 
domestic programs and foreign affairs money cant be transferred 
from one category to another 
defense spending will be reduced from 297 billion this year to 
296 billion in 1992 not including the costs of us operations 
in the middle east which will be counted separately 
although that seemingly is a 1 billion decrease it is 9 
billion less than the military would need to keep up with inflation 
next year according to preliminary estimates by the nonpartisan 
congressional budget office 
during that same time spending on domestic initiatives 
excluding benefit programs like social security will be allowed 
to rise from 198 billion to 210 billion but that will be 4 
billion less than those programs would need to stay even with 
inflation cbo says 
foreign affairs spending will change little from its current 
level of 20 billion 
this means two things first of all when the everrising cost 
of living is factored in there will be less money to go around for 
domestic spending next year secondly the money cut from the 
pentagons budget is not being spent its being used to reduce 
the deficit 
some officials say that after a decade in which domestic 
programs grew little if at all and considering us involvement 
in the persian gulf the added domestic spending is relatively 
generous 
im not saying were satisfied said marsha simon 
legislative director for families usa an advocacy group for the 
poor but given the constraints and the past history i dont 
think we could be expected to have done better 
others go even farther arguing that now is the time to repay 
the governments pastdue bills 
we went into debt building up our military defenses and 
winning the cold war said rep bill frenzel rminn outgoing 
ranking republican on the house budget committee the first thing 
we have to do is pay back some of that debt we got into 
even some liberals who were involved in this years budget talks 
say that because of the confrontation with iraq it was impossible 
to strike a deal pouring more money into domestic programs 
the defense savings arent as substantial as they should have 
been said sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate 
budget committee but it was very difficult to deliver a peace 
dividend in the face of a threat of war 
the three spending categories will merge in 1994 meaning that 
domestic programs will be able to grow at the expense of the 
military but until then advocates of stronger domestic 
initiatives are girding for tough competition for federal dollars 
among themselves 
it will precipitate infighting among allies said 
middletowns darden it will be very stressful

secretary of state james a baker iii chose his 
hometown to try to wrap up a nuclear weapons reduction treaty with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze but it may take 
more than relaxed texas hospitality to get the job done 
between trips to the johnson space center and other diversions 
today and tuesday baker and shevardnadze will review the 
conclusions of their negotiating teams and see whether they can 
agree on a handful of remaining issues on the strategic arms 
reduction treaty 
the toughest is verification ways to make sure neither side 
cheats on terms of the treaty which will provide for an overall 
reduction of about 30 percent in us and soviet longrange 
bombers missiles and submarines 
i have no doubt that our talks here in houston will be 
productive and that we will continue to tackle some difficult 
issues in a constructive spirit baker said sunday 
shevardnadze in a brief statement said in russian it seems 
we have a lot of work ahead of us noting that the united states 
and the soviet union have cooperated in some space ventures the 
foreign minister remarked i hope we will further solidify our 
cooperation on earth 
hardly anyone is still predicting the treaty will be ready to be 
signed at a moscow summit meeting next month it seems that every 
time you solve three issues there are three more that soar up 
jack mendelsohn the deputy director of the private arms control 
association remarked friday in washington 
the treaty has been in negotiation since 1982 the major 
elements are in place but some complex problems stand in the way 
of completing the accord such as procedures for exchanging 
information about arsenals and how to monitor mobile missiles 
we dont expect the treaty to be wrapped up in houston said 
a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity still we 
hope for completion early next year 
president bush had hoped he could sign the treaty on a visit to 
moscow in january his summit meeting with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev will be delayed until the accord is ready 
recently us and soviet negotiators made major headway by 
reaching tentative agreement on three key issues they sidetracked 
a dispute over the soviet backfire bomber decided some banned us 
weapons could be turned over to britain and imposed restrictions on 
the launch and payload weight of the soviets ss18 missiles 
but apart from monitoring arrangements several other issues are 
unsettled these include the kind of testing information to be 
exchanged and whether the soviets can inspect us b2 bombers 
the soviets sent negotiator alexei obukhov and other experts to 
washington for talks beginning last friday with a us group headed 
by under secretary of state reginald bartholomew the idea was to 
try to pave the way for baker and shevardnadze by clearing up some 
of the technicalities 
the two teams also will be in houston hipdeep in details 
while baker and shevardnadze talk about the persian gulf crisis and 
other regional disputes and make a visit to the johnson space 
center 
nasa technicians will try to arrange a phone patch to astronauts 
on a shuttle mission so baker and shevardnadze can talk to them 
the soviet foreign minister also will inspect a mockup of the space 
shuttle 
on wednesday they will fly back to washington where 
shevardnadze will meet with bush at the white house if the treaty 
is ready that could produce announcement of a summit date 
but us officials are skeptical the two sides can get that far 
by wednesday

your son and 247 other american soldiers are 
killed in a plane crash in gander newfoundland while flying home 
from duty in the middle east you seek solace from the us 
government and you look to canada for answers about why he died 
instead 
some canadian investigators suggest the plane might have been 
bombed 
others say ice on the wings caused the crash 
the us government rules out a terrorist connection even 
though it fails to conduct a thorough investigation because the air 
disaster occurred outside the united states 
five years after one of the worst military aviation tragedies in 
history many families of the victims in the gander crash believe 
the reagan and bush administrations are covering up a terrorist 
act 
they treated them just like they were a herd of cattle that 
went to slaughter says james godsey of newport news va whose 
brother was on the gander plane 
invitations sent by the families to the white house to attend a 
memorial service have gone unanswered pleas to congress were met 
with opposition 
show me the smoking gun one congressional aide said when a 
family member tried to interest him in delving into the crash 
seconds before the plane went down on dec 12 1985 
eyewitnesses reported seeing a bright light as if the plane was on 
fire islamic jihad a terrorist group with ties to iran claimed 
responsibility for the downing of the dc8 days before the 
disaster white house aide oliver north confided to his superiors 
that islamic jihad might retaliate because iran was unhapy with a 
secret shipment of antiaircraft missiles sent by the reagan 
administration 
congress let them get by in irancontra and now they roll 
over and play dead on the gander crash complained connie farmer 
of hartsville sc who lost a son in the tragedy 
she said her youngest son aaron is a gungho army private 
deployed as part of operation desert shield he plans to hold a 
memorial service for his brother kyle dec 12 in saudi arabia 
with some members of the 101st airborne division the troops on the 
gander flight were from the 101st 
miamibased arrow air operated the plane that carried the 
soldiers to their deaths in gander the same company shipped goods 
to the contras for norths secret resupply network 
at first i thought my son died because the government let him 
ride home on a piece of junk that was an accident waiting to 
happen said dr doug phillips of st petersburg fla a 
pathologist 
then phillips found out that many of the bodies in the gander 
crash contained high levels of carbon monoxide suggesting the 
plane was on fire before it hit the ground 
phillips and his wife asked the canadian government to open a 
judicial inquiry and they also sought an inquest into the deaths in 
the province of newfoundland their requests were turned down 
the families of the gander victims finally got someone in 
congress to listen 
rep william hughes dnj called a twoday hearing of his 
house judiciary subcommittee on crime to examine the us response 
to the gander crash 
during the hearings last week the army the national 
transportation safety board the fbi and the state department 
emphasized one point the canadian government was responsible for 
looking into the gander crash 
the families have a right to expect more than that from the us 
government hughes subcommittee admonished the agency 
representatives 
i have thought from day one that the plane was bombed said 
godsey whose late brother was assigned to special operations in 
the army and trained for rapid deployment and hostage rescues 
i wonder how much taxpayers money its going to cost to cover 
up this air crash godsey asked 
linda tatnall of hudson mass had a brother aboard the gander 
plane 
i think the government owes us more than a botched 
investigation she said

behind the gray bars of doggie 
death row sits a pit bull named spot tried and convicted of biting 
people but granted a stay of execution while his homeless owner 
appeals 
spot 85 pounds of muscle fur and nervous energy was found 
guilty of biting two people in a latenight scuffle under a fig 
tree where owner ed mannon sometimes sleeps 
spot was impounded and sentenced to die unless mannon gives the 
dog a proper home with a fence something mannon says he cant 
even give himself 
this wouldnt happen if i had a house said mannon 38 
homeless for 10 years i dont know how to be nice about this 
anymore this is just one of the many interruptions the city has 
made into my life 
police see it as a public safety matter and say spot earlier bit 
another man 
i think its a little bit ludicrous said police spokesman 
lt richard glaus were not in the dog killing business per se 
we do have an obligation to maintain public safety this guy 
habitually keeps his dog not even on a leash 
spot was sent to the pound after a midnight clash in march in an 
area between the freeway and the train tracks where the citys 
homeless gather 
two people were bitten but not seriously hurt mannon contends 
they were attacked after they tried to steal a radio and one of 12 
puppies fathered by spot the puppies mother tina another pit 
bull did some of the biting but spot got all the blame mannon 
claims 
tina does not belong to mannon 
mannon bought spot for 100 in 1987 and say the dog protects him 
from street thugs and once helped him beat a marijuana rap by 
eating the evidence 
at a hearing a police lieutenant heard antispot testimony from 
fellow officers and animalcontrol authorities mannons defense 
included character witnesses and a videotape of him playing with 
spot at the county kennel 
the lieutenant decided spot should be killed or kept at the 
pound permanently unless he is kept in a fenced yard or on a leash 
mannon appealed to superior court he called the properhome 
option a thinly veiled effort to deny homeless people the right to 
own dogs the court upheld the ruling but granted a stay of 
execution while the case is under appeal 
will hastings an attorney with the nonprofit legal defense 
center took over spots case which is now before the state 
appeals court 
ed would not have been in this situation and neither would the 
dog if ed had not been homeless said hastings

stability of the yen and government bonds as well as forecasts for 
lower us interest rates

following earlier gains 
in the currency market the dollar remained lower because of 
concerns that the us federal reserve board may further cut 
interest rates before the end of the year dealers said lower 
interest rates make the dollar less attractive

flies and maggots can tell investigators when 
people died and whether they took drugs they can also help solve 
cases involving the living 
m lee goff a university of hawaii entomologist who runs a 
honolulu company called forensic entomology enterprises said 
police usually call him to help figure out how long someones been 
dead 
but last summer he got a different question how long had a baby 
barely alive and covered with bruises and maggots been left 
near a hawaii lake 
she was quiet enough that flies had been attracted initially 
they were attracted to the feces in her diapers goff said in new 
orleans last week at a conference of the entomological society of 
america 
based on the maggots size and other factors the insect expert 
estimated the baby had been there 27 hours 
he testified at the trial of the childs mother sharon klafta 
32 who was convicted of attempted murder in september for leaving 
16monthold heathe near the lake in april the child now lives in 
a foster home and the mother is in prison 
more and more goff said forensic entomologists are called to 
testify about abuse to the living as well as about decomposition of 
the dead goff estimated there are about a dozen forensic 
entomologists nationwide 
some of my colleagues have been showing neglect of the 
elderly he said the nursing home will say yes we clean and 
bathe them regularly but the maggots have been sitting there and 
developing for five or six days 
their testimony is based on expertise on the life cycles and 
eating habits of insects that feed on still bodies 
there are about 230 such insects in hawaii and nearly twice as 
many in the mainland united states he said 
goffs job gets harder but not impossible the longer a 
person has been dead he said 
he recalled a case in which he examined bones and dirt from a 
childs grave judging from the beetles larval skins and mites in 
the dirt goff estimated the child died 52 days earlier 
when the suspect confessed it turned out to be the morning 53 
days before we were there he said 
drug cases are especially challenging he said when asked to 
find out how long a cocaine user had been dead he had to do some 
experimenting 
i really didnt know if cocaine in the tissues would affect 
the development of the flies i began raising flies on tissue 
diffused with cocaine he said 
flies and their eggs grew at a normal rate he said but once 
the maggots began feeding they growth rate rapidly increased until 
they changed into flies 
he also learned that maggots feeding on a cocaine or heroin user 
retain the drug 
as a body decomposes it becomes very difficult to detect 
drugs he said the maggots pick up the drug and store it you 
can analyze the maggot and show the drug was in the body

voters have given a former guerrilla 
army the largest bloc in an assembly that will rewrite the 
countrys constitution dealing a resounding defeat to colombias 
traditional parties 
as if to punctuate its insistence that leftists can do better at 
the polls than in the jungle the army on sunday raided the 
headquarters of a recalcitrant rebel group the revolutionary armed 
forces of colombia 
the attack south of bogota claimed the lives of 11 soldiers and 
as many as 40 rebels the army said 
violent groups have lost their argument to persevere in their 
practices of hate president cesar gaviria said in a televised 
speech sunday night 
the voting capped a bizarre 12 months in south american 
politics last december brazil elected littleknown businessman 
fernando collor de mello as its president in june peru selected 
alberto fujimori a virtually unknown agronomist as its president 
only about 30 percent of the roughly 12 million eligible voters 
went to the polls on sunday elections officials said 
while the overall composition of the 70member constituent 
assembly will be conservativetomoderate the results marked a 
remarkable turnabout for the leftist april 19th movement known as 
m19 which laid down its arms in march 
with 83 percent of the vote counted m19 had 27 percent of the 
vote and should control 20 seats political analysts said 
the governing liberal party garnered around 26 percent of the 
vote 
a rightwing splinter group of the conservative party the 
national salvation party won 16 percent of the vote while the 
traditional conservative party captured around 10 percent the rest 
of the vote was spread among smaller parties 
the assembly is empowered to reform a 104yearold constitution 
that has been inadequate to handle vast political and drugrelated 
violence and extortion government corruption and desperate 
poverty 
expected changes include revamping the battered courts adding 
safeguards to curb corruption and establishing new civil rights 
for prisoners 
colombias powerful cocaine cartels are widely believed to have 
donated money to assembly candidates although little hard evidence 
surfaced candidates rarely mentioned the governments 15monthold 
war on drug traffickers 
colombia has been dominated throughout its 160year history by 
the liberals and the conservativesbut sunday the voters showed 
more faith in m19 chief antonio navarro wolf a 41yearold 
engineer more accustomed to kidnapping businessmen and hijacking 
airliners than making campaign speeches 
yet the m19 victory was oddly characteristic of a group always 
better at capturing the imagination than capturing territory in 
war 
the group takes its name from the date of an allegedly rigged 
1970 presidential election 
its inaugural act in 1974 was to steal the sword of simon 
bolivar the hero of latin american independence in 1980 the 
rebels raided a dinner party and held the us ambassador and other 
diplomats captive for weeks 
political violence has claimed about 75000 lives in colombia 
since the late 1960s 
drug traffickers killed about 550 people over the past year 
including three candidates in last mays presidential elections as 
they tried to force the government to stop extraditing cocaine 
smugglers to the united states 
many candidates including navarro were unable to take their 
campaigns to the streets for fear of being killed

armed conflict connally said 
most of the former hostages who looked gaunt and tired said 
they generally were treated well all complained about food 
shortages 
i lost some weight said allen lawson of huntsville texas 
but as far as being mistreated no i was not mistreated i know 
we sometimes got more food than the iraqi citizens 
jackie nelson wife of former hostage bill nelson of los

bless you i cant thank you enough were so grateful 
the oilmen exhausted from the 18hour flight were moved to 
tears

god bless america theres nothing like it said nelson who 
was held at a munitions plant 37 miles south of baghdad these 
people are marvelous they have done things our government cant do 
and wont do

voter defeat of a government overhaul designed to 
help minorities get elected to city council means a federal judge 
is free to impose a new setup on the city 
residents on saturday rejected by 369 votes a measure under 
which 14 council members would be elected from districts and the 
mayor would be elected from the city as a whole the vote was 
45255 in favor and 45624 against 
under the current system instituted in 1975 eight members are 
elected from districts and three others including the mayor are 
elected from the city at large 
with the plans defeat us district judge jerry buchmeyer 
could institute the same plan or a similar one and call a city 
council election in may mayor annette strauss said the judge 
indicated he could rule as early as january 
supporters said the plan would have helped ease racial 
inequities that make it difficult for minorities to get elected 
opponents said the system would have resegregated dallas they 
backed a plan calling for 10 candidates to be elected by district 
four by larger districts or regions and the mayor by the city as 
a whole 
the referendum was part of the settlement of a 1988 lawsuit 
brought by roy williams and marvin crenshaw blacks who failed in 
their atlarge council bids they charged that the election system 
made it difficult for minorities to win office 
black and hispanic leaders nationwide have long charged that 
atlarge elections dilute minority voting strength 
crenshaw said he was confident the judicial system would not 
fail supporters of the 141 plan and i think judge buchmeyer is 
going to take that stake and drive it through the vampires 
heart he said 
al gonzalez chairman of the 141 for dallas committee blamed 
the referendums failure on poor turnout among minorities 
i was shocked he said you can make a lot of excuses it 
was saturday if it was pouring whatever we should have got that 
vote out the minority community has nobody to blame but 
themselves

a political opponent of manuel noriega who helped 
us drug agents decipher tapes of the former dictators phone 
calls from jail denied leaking the tapes to cnn 
the fbi believes jose blandon a former intelligence officer and 
diplomat under noriega may have been the source of the leak the 
miami herald and the washington post reported this weekend citing 
unidentified sources 
however blandon said the fbi investigation into who gave cnn 
the tapes it has broadcast over the past month should focus instead 
on us officials who may want to keep noriegas drug trafficking 
trial from going forward and embarrassing agencies that worked with 
noriega before his downfall the post reported sunday 
somebody in the government was leaking them blandon told 
the post he said that drug enforcement administration agents were 
present whenever he had access to the tapes and that he was allowed 
to take notes only 
blandon said he spent five full days in may and june reviewing 
22 of the tapes at the dea in miami before describing their 
contents to a large group of dea agents 
the us attorneys office in miami has maintained that 
prosecutors in the noriega trial have not been exposed to tapes of 
privileged conversations between noriega and his attorneys 
however blandon said assistant us attorney michael p 
sullivan visited him at his miami hotel room after the dea review 
and asked for a briefing on the tapes 
i mentioned everything blandon told the post including a 
conversation in which noriega and defense attorney frank rubino 
discussed how to deal with luis del cid a former noriega aide who 
has pleaded guilty and promised to testify against his former boss 
i discussed this with sullivan 
after he returned home that weekend blandon said he received a 
call from a dea agent saying the agency urgently wanted a 
memorandum describing the content of the calls because sullivan 
was asking for that 
blandon said he faxed a sixpage memorandum to the dea on a 
machine that was seized by fbi agents during a search of his home 
in houston on thursday 
in court documents filed friday prosecutors said a dea agent 
reviewed the memorandum and determined that while it spoke of a 
call between noriega and his attorney this was not a privileged 
attorneyclient conversation 
noriegas defense has asked us district judge william hoeveler 
to dismiss the drug case alleging the governments taping of his 
phone calls violated his right to attorneyclient confidentiality 
the judge has yet to rule 
noriega is accused of taking 46 million in bribes to protect 
the cocaine trade passing through panama to the united states

when the mayor of this small 
overwhelmingly white town said there werent enough blacks to 
justify a martin luther king holiday he was faced with a minority 
that wasnt so silent 
blacks in neighboring kankakee boycotted bradley businesses 
now merchants are worried and village officials are offering an 
apology and a holiday 
but the holiay would leave village offices open and blacks say 
that is not enough 
i think they are sincere and we are making progress said 
the rev william copeland a leader in kankakees black community 
but were not there yet 
bradley mayor kenneth hayes may not have realized just how close 
kankakee was when he rejected the idea of a holiday on kings 
birthday which falls on jan 15 but is being observed on jan 21 
martin luther king was a great man for the black people 
we have five or six blacks in bradley why should we close down 
services for the other 11995 he told the kankakee daily 
journal 
just across the town line some 10000 blacks live in kankakee 
a city 50 miles south of chicago with a population of about 32000 
some of them shop in bradley 
at least 2000 people black and white have pledged not to 
cross that line in protest against the mayors remarks copeland 
said 
bradley leaders met with copeland and other black ministers 
thursday they offered an unsigned pology from hayes hospitalized 
in chicago for lung surgery and a resolution proclaiming a king 
holiday but leaving village offices open 
theyre saying theyll celebrate on paper but it will be 
business as usual in bradley said copeland we want a real 
holiday we want the mayor to sign the apology and we want a 
pledge from them to work for fair housing and affirmative action 
bradley village board member howard duchene said hayes would 
sign the apology when he recovered but he said the village may not 
be able to afford a paid holiday for kings birthday 
meanwhile black leaders say a blackoriented fashion show has 
moved from bradley to kankakee and blacks have returned christmas 
gifts bought in bradley and canceled group shopping trips there 
if blacks feel strongly that they were offended they should 
stand up for what they believe but its not our fault and i wish 
they wouldnt punish us said mark viers manager of nrm music in 
bradleys new shopping mall the mayor doesnt speak for all of 
us 
some residents line up with the mayor 
i cannot believe that in this day and age in a country whose 
citizens are supposed to be free to choose i am being told which 
persons lives to glorify david albers of bradley wrote to the 
kankakee daily journal

after eight days as the first journalist in space 
toyohiro akiyama safely touched down today with downtoearth 
cravings for beer good food and a smoke 
it seems like i came back as a mass of desire akiyama 48 
said after emerging from the soyuz space capsule that landed on the 
frozen tundra in kazakstan the soviet republic in central asia 
akiyama a news director for the tokyo broadcasting system was 
the first japanese in space he returned with cosmonauts gennady 
manakov and gennady strekalov who were concluding a fourmonth 
stay aboard the mir space station 
tbs paid the soviets 12 million for akiyamas rocket fare and 
spent an additional 25 million on the project 
as soon as akiyama emerged from the capsule waving and smiling 
he was mobbed by tbs reporters who had raced to the landing site to 
beam live to japan his first words back on terra firma 
yes its very beautiful he said when asked how it felt to 
be back on earth tbs then arranged for akiyama to say a few words 
to his wife kyoko who had watched the landing from the companys 
tokyo studios 
im back said akiyama wrapped in a parka and with his 
space helmet still in place i worried a bit replied his wife 
did the kids do all right on their exams he asked 
why ask such things now she shot back 
i want to eat something good 
ive prepared it his wife reassured him 
the saturation coverage by tbs of akiyamas mission reached a 
crescendo with todays allday live broadcast of the landing which 
came at about 305 pm local time 
tbs had rented four helicopters with cameras mounted underneath 
to cover two possible landing sites when a reporter from one of 
the helicopters first spotted the capsule plummeting to earth he 
repeatedly yelled in tones of near hysteria i see it i see it 
its there its there 
reporters were at the landing site less than 10 minutes after 
touchdown and repeatedly mentioned how charred the capsule looked 
when asked by an anchorman whethe the capsule was still hot a 
journalist at the scene touched the side and reported back i 
cant tell because i have gloves on 
akiyamas odyssey in space began dec 2 with liftoff from the 
baikonur cosmodrome about 1300 miles east of moscow he and two 
soviet cosmonauts linked up with the space station mir on tuesday 
tbs which sent akiyama into space as part of the companys 40th 
anniversary celebrations aired exclusive live broadcasts from 
their astroreporter each night that won strong ratings 
in those reports akiyama explained how it felt to be weightless 
and to be space sick which he described as being akin to a 
hangover 
he expressed concerns about global pollution he viewed from 
orbit and even recited japanese haiku poetry 
akiyama also took six japanese tree frogs into space for 
experiments on how they adapt to the weightless environment tbs 
said videotape of these experiments may be shown later 
taking along a paying passenger was an important step in the 
soviets effort to commercialize their space program and akiyamas 
trip has been a relentlessly commercial affair japanese corporate 
sponsors including a diaper maker and a toothpaste company had 
their logos and names plastered on the rocket that launched akiyama 
into space 
tbs expects to lose 74 million on the project even after 
accounting for advertising revenues and proceeds from documentaries 
and lectures by akiyama

police said today that 25 
people died in black factional fighting as president fw de klerk 
and african national congress leader nelson mandela continued 
efforts to end political unrest 
police reported scattered clashes over the weekend with the 
worst violence in the johannesburg black township of tokoza where 
13 people were killed 
eleven men were hacked and shot to death in the township 
another man was necklaced with a burning tire and a 
sixyearold girl was gunned down police said dozens of people 
died in tokoza last week in clashes 
de klerk and mandela issued a statement late sunday revealing 
they had been holding secret talks on halting the violence that has 
claimed about 1000 lives in the johannesburg area since august 
the statement said the two leaders had met several times in recent 
weeks including a secret meeting saturday 
the statement said significant progress had been made but gave 
no details it said urgent followup steps would be taken 
the statement said the major problem to be resolved involved the 
ancs suspension of its armed struggle against the whiteled 
government agreed to at a meeting in pretoria aug 6 
the government has accused the anc of violating the agreement by 
continuing to recruit and train members for armed struggle the anc 
contends it never agreed to end preparations for possible future 
armed struggle 
the anc suspended its largely ineffective armed struggle as aconcession 
in the talks aimed at ending apartheid and setting up 
fullscale negotiations on a new constitution 
the anc has repeatedly accused government security forces of 
instigating the violence between black groups much of the violence 
has pitted anc partisans against the mostly zulu inkatha freedom 
party 
in other developments inkatha called at its annual congress for 
an end to economic sanctions against south africa and urged all 
black political groups to unite to end factional fighting a party 
resolution passed sunday urged all black groups to ensure a quick 
start to talks with the government 
all scrutiny and all analysis will show that the process of 
reform is irreversible that apartheid is totally doomed and that 
all that remains is finally to finish dismembering it and throwing 
its pieces away the inkatha congress said 
the congress called for the united nations and the european 
community to adopt a rigorous timetable for ending sanctions 
as effectively and expeditiously as possible 
inkatha supporters and anc backers have waged virtual warfare in 
natal province for five years killing more than 5000 people the 
fighting spread in august to the johannesburg area where some 
1000 people have died 
the pan africanist congress the most militant of the main black 
opposition groups concluded its first congress inside south africa 
in 31 years on sunday by rejecting negotiations with the government 
on a new constitution

the pentagon may have to ask congress for up to 
20 billion more to cover the persian gulf buildup the new york 
times reported today 
the costs of the operation have risen sharply because of plans 
to add up to 200000 troops to the us forces already in the 
region the newspaper said 
us officials said the request reflects an estimate that the 
persian gulf operation could cost as much as 31 billion the times 
said it said that contributions from american allies might offset 
less than half of that amount 
despite the unknowns such as what the precise cost will be and 
how much allies will contribute a senior pentagon official quoted 
by the times said congress may be asked to allot 16 billion to 20 
billion more when lawmakers reassemble in january 
before the nov 8 decision to add troops to those already in the 
persian gulf it was estimated congress would have to allot about 
5 billion during the fiscal year that began oct 1 
the anticipated 1991 costs of the deployment will have no impact 
on the budget agreement struck last fall the agreement omitted 
expenses for the gulf operation because they could not be 
calculated 
there was no immediate indication of whether the additional 
costs would be covered through higher taxes or through borrowing 
the times said

lorin hubbard says he felt no fear as 
he waited for american bombs to fall on the iraqi ammunition plant 
where he was held as a human shield 
we were hoping theyd blow the place up the angry tired 
boeing aircraft executive said as he trudged through the frankfurt 
airport a free man after four and a half months as a vulnerable 
pawn 
hubbard 66 was among scores of westerners taken hostage by the 
iraqis and designated human shields dispatched to areas the iraqis 
considered vulnerable to a us attack 
he said he and his wife who had lived in kuwait city for more 
than five years were picked up in kuwait city by iraqi troops 
shortly after the persian gulf nation invaded the tiny emirate 
he and about 40 other foreigners were taken to baghdad in an 
unairconditioned bus in the heat of the day babies and 
everything 
he said they were farmed out to other locations and that he and 
his wife were held in an office at a munitions plant about 40 miles 
west of baghdad 
the composition of the nationalities he was with changed with 
the diplomatic overtures made by various countries 
theyd take the french out then theyd bring somebody else 
in then theyd take the germans out said hubbard who is from 
seattle 
we had no idea when wed get out he said nobody knew 
where we were as far as i know 
asked if he felt in danger to a us attack on the ammo factory 
hubbard said 
i want to see them make a hole in the ground at that place 
he said we were hoping they would i hope they blow it up 
many other former hostages expressed rage when their ordeal 
finally ended several who managed to avoid detection in kuwait 
said they were aided by an organized underground of kuwaiti 
citizens 
don latham an engineer from albuquerque nm said he worked 
with a kuwaiti resistance that called itself the guardians 
the last thing i saw was a kuwaiti family that had given 
refuge to an american citizen he said they the iraqis 
killed seven members of the family 
he said he photographed the body of a 12yearold boy 
those murdering bastards he said 
latham 51 said that he went underground with his 70yearold 
stepfather who had come to visit him just two days before the 
invasion 
several families put us up he said the resistance is not 
totally violent theyre much more concerned with taking care of 
the people getting food not just to the kuwaitis but anybody 
ernest alexander originally from media penn ran a law firm 
in kuwait and also spent the time since the invasion in hiding 
aided by the kuwaiti underground he said 
he said he believes kuwaitis would welcome a us military 
effort 
they all do to every man to every woman to every child even 
if it means theyre all under a rain of bombs said alexander 
39 
it was very demoralizing to find americans suggesting that 
sanctions ought to go on for a year 18 months 
pete dooley arrived in kuwait in february to run a string of 
restaurants for his company he said he hid in his apartment during 
the siege 
they came to the door but i didnt answer said the 
40yearold resident of hopkinsville ky 
he said kuwaitis and some palestinians helped him get around 
very many people have left he said everybody that could 
leave is gone 
he said he was looking forward to going home

astronomer bill blair has been 
waxing poetic over columbias starcrossed mission for months much 
to his colleagues delight 
the research scientist at johns hopkins university started 
giving songs and poems a shuttle twist long before fuel leaks 
halted the missions fourth countdown in september he is part of 
the team managing the universitys ultraviolet telescope aboard the 
shuttle 
one of his first efforts at finetuning songs was with fifty 
ways to leave your lover he wrote four or five versions of the 
song all called fifty ways to lose your pointings based on 
problems simulated during training that came true after launch 
another lyric happily was not so prescient well be 
launched by christmas but only in our dreams 
since we got launched by christmas i never fleshed that one 
out the rest of the way he said laughing 
other team members have come up with occasional lyrics about the 
mission which was delayed by fuel leaks for months before the dec 
2 launch and has been hampered by technical problems since but 
blair 37 goes that one further 
its just been sort of a joke he said rather than just 
saying one phrase from a song at the dinner table and we all laugh 
about it i sit down and do a whole song 
his latest effort the night before astro was beamed up 
to the astronauts on columbia during a science briefing late 
saturday night the poem is filled with acronyms decipherable only 
by spacesavvy types a sample 
in the pocc back in huntsville we sat and we waited 
although more than one veterans mood was quite jaded 
the countdown went smoothly the apus worked 
the srbs fired it lurched and it jerked 
it cleared the launch tower we hooted and whistled 
and away they all flew on the back of that missile 
blair said he came up with the idea for the holiday poem after 
he arrived at marshall space flight center in huntsville ala 
just prior to last weeks launch marshall houses the payload 
operations control center pocc pronounced pock 
i was working the night shift and little phrases of it kept 
going through my head usually at two in the afternoon when i was 
supposed to be asleep blair said i just got inspired enough 
to finish it 
blair said he wanted to include personal notes about the 
astronauts in the poem but i just ran out of gas 
blair currently is altering the lyrics of deck the halls 
i keep trying to stop i should be sleeping not doing this on 
my offshift time he said early sunday evening before reporting 
to work 
im working on deck the halls with plots of data i havent 
gotten the rest of it yet but im working on it were delighted 
to be getting some data believe me its taken a long time

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
accepted the 1990 nobel peace prize in absentia today he said 
problems in his homeland prevented him from coming to the awards 
ceremony 
i do not regard the the 1990 nobel peace prize as an award to 
me personally but as a recognition of what we call perestroika and 
innovative political thinking which is of vital significance for 
human destinies all over the world gorbachev said in a message 
from moscow 
in an acceptance speech read by his envoy anatoly kovalyov 
gorbachev promised to continue the process of openness and reform 
kovalyov said the prizes 715000 cash award probably would be 
donated to worthy causes 
nobel prizes in physics chemistry literature medicine and 
economics were to be awarded later today in stockholm sweden 
the norwegian nobel committee said the 71st peace prize 
recognized gorbachevs international efforts more than his 
domestic policies 
but committee leader gidske anderson said at the oslo city hall 
ceremony that she hoped the award would be seen as a helping hand 
in an hour of need as gorbachev and the soviet people cope with 
the restructing of their economy and government 
this transformation is inevitably a painful porcess involving 
great sacrifice she said norways royalty government leaders 
and roughly 900 guests applauded as anderson presented the peace 
prize medal and diploma to gorbachevs standin 
gorbachev had hoped to attend the ceremony in person but last 
month said problems at home required his attention hour by 
hour 
demonstrators in moscow protested the award sunday and today 
blaming gorbachev for ethnic and political violence in his own 
country 
gorbachev quoting the 18th century german philospher immanuel 
kant said in his acceptance speech kant prophesized that 
mankind would one day be faced with a dilemma either to be joined 
in a true union of nations or to perish in a war of annihilation 
ending in the extinction of the human race 
now as we move from the second to the third millennium the 
clock has struck the moment of truth gorbachev wrote 
the year 1990 represents a turning point he said it marks 
the end of the unnatural division of europe germany has been 
reunited we have begun to resolutely tear down the material 
foundations of a military political and ideological 
confrontation 
an unofficial translation of gorbachevs twopage statement said 
the peace prize recognized that perestroika and reform no longer 
belong to soviets alone 
they are the property of the whole of mankind and are an 
inseparable part of its destiny and of a safe peaceful future 
the text said 
gorbachev thanked norway and the west for supporting the 
soviet unions struggle to adopt greater openness and freer markets 
a struggle that has unleashed anger protests and frustation in 
his own country due to shortages of food and products 
but anderson said the 1990 award very much reflected the wishes 
of alfred nobel the swedish inventor of dynamite who endowed the 
nobel prizes in his 1896 will 
nobel wanted the prize to be awarded to someone who had worked 
to promote fraternity between nations to someone who actively 
promoted a reduction in standing armies and worked for the 
holding of peace congresses she said in her prepared remarks 
gorbachev is the the third eastern european who has not received 
his prize in person since 1975 
the award this year is an historic event not least because 
of some of the previous awards made by our committee anderson 
said 
she said the 1975 award to soviet human rights champion andrei 
sakharov and the 1983 award to polands lech walesa were greeted 
with cool hostility in the soviet union and poland 
neither laurate was able to attend the ceremony and their 
governments rejected everything the committee stood for she said 
now the soviet president has accepted the same award

more than 150 americans some looking 
gaunt and weary after more than four months as hostages in iraq and 
kuwait flew to the united states today aboard a chartered 
jetliner 
four canadians and 152 americans left frankfurt on a pan am 
plane headed for andrews air force base near washington us 
consular officials said 
hamburgers and champagne were among the provisions on the jet 
the flight left frankfurt at 226 pm about 13 hours earlier 
an iraqi airways airliner delivered the former captives about two 
dozen other americans and 101 britons to frankfurt airport 
some of the americans who arrived in germany from iraq after 
midnight sunday were to return to the united states on later 
flights 
the former hostages said they had a scare as the 747 descended 
into frankfurt from baghdad the plane began to shudder as it 
approached the runway and the landing was aborted 
no explanation was given but the second landing attempt was 
uneventful 
after a few hours sleep the americans some of whom lost up to 
40 pounds during their captivity awoke to a huge breakfast of ham 
and eggs bacon corn flakes and hash browns 
i wallowed in the ham said former human shield chris 
folsom 51 of doylestown pa 
two of the men who had been hiding in kuwait planned to fly 
directly home to albuquerque nm to bypass the hostage 
homecoming as a protest against the administrations handling of 
their release a relative said 
ruth kho said her father eugene hughes and his stepson donald 
latham have some hard feelings toward the united states 
government 
the voice of america didnt broadcast that they could come out 
of hiding she said as a result the men took a chance in coming 
to the airport in kuwait city where they were forced to wait in 
the desert for eight hours before being flown out sunday she said 
iraqs parliament on friday approved a decree by president 
saddam hussein to release the estimated 8000 american european 
and japanese citizens who had been forbidden from leaving kuwait 
and iraq 
us officials said they planned to charter another flight from 
baghdad in three or four days to evacuate the rest of the estimated 
750 americans in iraq and kuwait 
the flight to frankfurt included about 80 americans who had been 
stranded in kuwait for more than four months following the aug 2 
iraqi invasion 
they told of hiding in crawl spaces with little to eat of an 
underground resistance that helped foreigners and of brutal 
treatment meted out to kuwaitis by the occupying army 
kuwait city no longer exists its dead said latham 51 an 
engineer 
latham who lived in kuwait city for five years said his 
70yearold stepfather had come to visit him two days before the 
iraqi invasion 
weve been in hiding ever since weve been working with the 
kuwaiti resistance he said 
he said there is an organized underground called the 
guardians who set up a food distribution network and a system to 
help underground foreigners 
they are not so much concerned with killing iraqis as with 
taking care of the people latham said 
thomas kreuzman 38 of holiday fla said he spent 23 days 
hiding in an airconditioning duct with his dog they lived on dry 
spaghetti and sneaked out at night for water he said 
randal warren 49 a construction worker from charleston mo 
described hiding out on the top floor of an apartment house 
keeping the curtains closed the entire time and wearing no shoes to 
hold down the noise 
a palestinian and a turkish friend brought supplies about every 
two weeks warren said this is the first time i have had shoes 
on in over three months 
the freed hostages also included socalled human shields who 
had been kept at strategic locations in iraq 
robert vinton of santa fe nm said he was held south of 
baghdad at an oil refinery he said he was picked up aug 18 on a 
baghdad street 
it was like a gulag the 58yearold vinton said he was 
held with up to eight other foreigners at a time he said though 
he added we were mostly left alone 
joseph lammerding 35 of sacramento calif said that after 
visiting his parents he plans to return to the gulf to help push 
the iraqis out of kuwait 
lammerding who spent four months in hiding in kuwait said the 
iraqis brutally retaliated against kuwaitis who were trying to 
offer resistance and protect foreigners 
sometimes they would shoot one member of a family sometimes 
the entire family they raped and plundered literally said 
lammerding who described himself as an adviser to the kuwaiti 
military who had lived in the emirate since 1983 
but the hostage crisis wasnt hell for everyone 
david dorrington 43 said he spent most of the crisis hidden 
with five other britons in a villa in kuwait 
our basic living conditions were embarrassingly rather good 
we had very good help from our filipino maid who supplied us with 
everything and was absolutely magic he said 
but three weeks ago dorrington said he was arrested and taken 
to baghdad 
a dutchman who flew to rome early today said he was not 
mistreated although he was unable to leave baghdad unlike many 
american and british hostages the dutch werent forced to serve as 
human shields 
circumstances in baghdad were fairly normal we were able 
to go shopping get food and move around freely mario punte said 
in amsterdam where he arrived from rome

clubwielding police fought student 
demonstrators the albanian capital who staged a rare show of public 
defiance against the communist government but diplomats said there 
were no new clashes today 
a diplomat reached by telephone in tirana said there were 
injuries and arrests in sundays clash but he did not know how 
many 
the diplomat said without citing a source that more 
demonstrations had been planned for today but by noon there were 
no street gatherings nor any sign of an increased police presence 
talks between students and the government reportedly opened 
after sundays protest may have eased the tensions 
first word of the clash in tirana came in an unusually frank 
dispatch from the governmentcontrolled news agency ata 
it appeared to be the first instance in which ata was the first 
to report a confrontation between police and demonstrators in the 
isolationist balkan country 
the agency even indicated without providing specifics that the 
students who took to the streets were critical of communist 
authorities 
it said the students were angry about a power outage that left 
their dormitories without heat and light and that demonstrators 
had tried to exploit dissatisfaction over the lack of heat for 
political ends 
the students provoked the order forces and acted contrary to 
the law the agency reported security forces were forced to 
interfere in order to disperse them 
ata said negotiations subsequently began between student 
representatives and the minister of education and that a 
government commission was being formed to adopt measures to 
stabilize the situation and address the students demands 
the fourparagraph ata dispatch did not say how many students or 
police were involved did not elaborate on what demands the 
protesters had and contained no other substantive details 
one diplomat said a great many students took part in the 
demonstration near the university but a strong police force 
encircled the area then attacked the protesters with clubs 
there certainly were injuries because fights occurred when the 
police attacked the students the diplomat said 
diplomats reported no sign of any special police or military 
state of alert in tirana today 
here on our street where there are several embassies we are 
holding normal consular hours with people coming to see us one 
diplomat said the usual guards have not been increased 
the diplomats all spoke on condition of anonymity 
the fact that the incident was reported by the official news 
agency was in line with recent moves to slowly open albania to the 
outside world and ease controls on the countrys 32 million 
citizens 
albanian leaders have however rejected multiparty democracy of 
the kind that has replaced orthodox marxist rule in other east 
european countries 
in preparation for elections next year the communistcontrolled 
parliament last month approved a law that would allow independent 
candidates to run in secretballot elections however the law 
guarantees that only candidates who are not overt anticommunists 
can run 
strict control of the economy is being loosened and limited and 
some private enterprise is now encouraged the government also has 
eased regulations that had prevented all but a few albanians from 
going abroad

president vaclav havel asked 
parliament today for broader temporary powers to keep the country 
from breaking apart 
in an emergency speech he said czechoslovakias future is being 
threatened by a dispute over a division of powers between the 
federal government the czech republic and the slovak republic 
where nationalism has risen rapidly 
i am very sorry i had to go this far the 
playwrightturnedpresident said in the nationally televised 
speech i am doing this to fulfill the expectations of millions 
of citizens who entrusted this position to me and believe i 
will help save our federation 
our state is not this time threatened from the outside as so 
many times in the past but from the inside he said we are 
threatening it ourselves with ou low political culture lack of 
democratic consciousness and mututal understanding our lack of 
experience and personal bad qualities 
havel did not immediately say what powers he wants he said they 
would be included in a bill to be presented soon to parliament and 
he urged that it be considered immediately 
he said the powers would be in effect until a new constitution 
is adopted sometime within the next 18 months 
havel also proposed that parliament immediately set up a 
constitutional court and pass a law permitting national referenda 
as last resorts to settle political disputes 
under czechoslovakias current constitution havel is empowered 
to sign treaties command the armed forces appoint the federal 
government summon and dissolve parliament sign its laws grant 
amnesties or other legal pardons and declare war 
he is also allowed to assume extra powers granted by special 
law 
havel has been content for much of his nearly one year as 
president to be a moral force in politics but his tough speech 
today before parliament indicated that separatist threats from the 
slovak republic had forced him to act 
he singled out the premier of the slovak republic vladimir 
meciar for criticism 
slovak leaders have been quoted as saying that if the federal 
parliament insists on amending a draft agreement dividing powers 
among the federal government and the republics they will declare 
the sovereignty of slovak law on their territory 
parliament plans tuesday to debate a law dividing powers among 
the federal government and the two republics 
the czech and slovak parliaments differ over control of oil and 
gas pipelines taxation and budget questions postal services 
control over policy toward ethnic minorities and chairmanship of 
the national bank 
havel said a declaration of slovak sovereignty was clearly 
unconstitutional and said that whatever decision parliament makes 
is legally binding on all institutions and all people 
otherwise the thin ice of our constitution will be broken and 
our state would inevitably fall into legal chaos he said 
he warned that if czechoslovakia formed from two parts of the 
former austrohungarian empire in 1918 broke in two neither part 
could guarantee the inviolability of its borders and chances for 
economic reform would end 
western leaders repeatedly have warned czechoslovakia that its 
internal instability is one of the greatest threats to aid and 
investment 
czechoslovakia needs large amounts of both to throw off the 
vestiges of four decades of communism government economic policy 
calls for rapid privatization of the staterun economy beginning 
next year

the former communists and their 
hardline president slobodan milosevic led in early election 
returns today in serbia opposition leaders accused them of 
widespread voterigging 
first official results from just five of the republics 250 
voting districts showed milosevic with more than 66 percent of the 
overall vote for president his main challenger populist vuk 
draskovic had about 19 percent 
socialists also led the opposition for parliament in the five 
districts said caslav ignjatovic chairman of the republics 
electoral commission he estimated turnout at 80 percent 
officials of the opposition democratic party said no firm 
results were known in sundays elections serbias first free 
multiparty elections since 1938 but they reported indications from 
around yugoslavias largest republic gave an expected lead to 
milosevic and his socialists the renamed communists 
the state news agency tanjug said the socialists had won nearly 
80 of parliaments 250 seats according to its unofficial survey of 
140 districts 
a victory for milosevic and his party is thought likely to 
deepen yugoslavias regional strife which threatens to break the 
country apart 
a runoff vote will be held dec 23 for the presidency or any of 
the 250 serbian parliament seats in which no single candidate wins 
50 percent 
republicwide elections were also held sunday in montenegro 
where communists took an early lead according to unofficial 
returns reported by the official news agency tanjug 
tanjug said the communist candidate for montenegros presidency 
momir bulatovic appeared likely to win without having to face a 
runoff 
the marxist leaders of serbia and montenegro are pitted against 
the westernleaning republics of slovenia and croatia in the 
yugoslav power struggle 
at stake is whether the volatile balkan country stays together 
as a federal republic dissolves into a confederacy or collapses 
with member states becoming completely independent 
centerright coalitions ousted the communists in slovenia and 
croatia in regional elections earlier this year and advocate 
greater democracy and implementation of marketbased economic 
reform on the federal level 
milosevic the charismatic soclialist leader of serbia has 
refused to acknowledge the possibility of a federal breakup or to 
negotiate with the western republics 
draskovic of the serbian renewal movement has said he would 
negotiate with croatia and slovenia 
the voting was marred by charges of ballotrigging and 
widespread irregularities at the serbian republics 9500 polling 
stations 
electoral commission chairman caslav ignjatovic said he was 
investigating the claims 
draskovic said the socialists distributed campaign leaflets at 
polling stations sunday and that progovernment media also ignored 
a ban on campaigning that was to have extended two days before the 
election 
opposition leaders also claimed the socialists stopped 
registering deaths in serbia in april in a plan to rig the election 
using phantom votes 
communists are capable of doing anything to stay in 
power draskovic said 
both draskovic and milosevic stressed their support for tight 
serbian control over the formerly autonomous province of kosovo in 
the southern area of serbia 
the ethnic albanian majority in kosovo boycotted sundays 
elections to protest the serbian governments decision over the 
summer to strip them of selfrule and close albanian newspapers 
the divisions among serbians croats and slovenes as well as 
the kosovoserbia conflict reflect the babel of ethnic and 
political forces vying for power in yugoslavia the central 
intelligence agency predicted recently that the country could be 
torn apart within 18 months

rumors that president mikhail s gorbachev will 
step down as communist party chief are totally unfounded the 
staterun news agency tass said today 
gorbachev opened a plenary session of the partys central 
committee in the kremlin convened to discuss the partys position 
on a draft union treaty and tasks of party organizations tass 
said 
although the communist party has become an opposition party in 
many republics after the last elections it remains the only truly 
national political force tass said 
this gives gorbachev a chance to preserve the union and at the 
same time to give new meaning to sovereignty of union 
republics the news agency said therefore rumors that 
gorbachev may resign as party leader at this plenary meeting are 
totally unfounded 
tass did not say where the rumors came from 
the rumors echoed previous speculation that gorbachev would 
eventually step down as party chief continuing to wield power in 
his strengthened job as president gorbachev has been attempting to 
transfer to the government much of the communist partys once 
allpowerful control over the country 
tass said the central committee would discuss the new union 
treaty draft and preparations for the nations fourth congress of 
peoples deputies scheduled to open dec 17 
according to the tass report the central committee might make 
changes in the politburo following changes in the party leadership 
at the republican level in byelorussia and georgia 
despite a change in the balance of political forces in the 
country much depends on the results of todays plenum tass 
said 
the union treaty under discussion by the central committee 
defines the relationship between the kremlin and the 15 soviet 
republics 
the proposed treaty gorbachevs plan for saving the union from 
collapse has also been sent to the legislatures of the soviet 
union and the republics for approval 
however six republics have already said they will not sign the 
document which would give them virtual control over all affairs 
except defense 
the draft treaty represents the central governments attempt to 
preserve the union and appease secession movments by the republics 
and smaller regions while creating a uniform marketoriented 
economic system 
the central committee meeting was closed to the public and 
reporters

here is a partial text of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs speech accepting the 1990 nobel peace prize 
on monday the english translation was supplied by the nobel 
committee 
the prize has been awarded since the beginning of this 
century the disasters and tragedies of this period which have not 
managed to subdue mans optimism and unflagging belief in human 
reason have given the peace prize the unique aura associated with 
it today 
immanuel ant prophesied that mankind would one day be faced 
with a dilemma either to be joined in a true union of nations or 
to perish in a war of annihilation ending in the extinction of the 
human race now as we move from the second to the third 
millennium the clock has struck the moment of truth 
in this respect the year 1990 represents a turning point it 
marks the end of the unnatural division of europe germany has been 
reunited we have begun resolutely to tear down the material 
foundations of a military political and ideological confrontation 
but there are some very grave threats that have not been 
eliminated the potential for conflict and the primitive instincts 
that allow it aggressive intentions and totalitarian traditions 
i would like to assure you that the leadership of the ussr 
is doing and will continue to do everything in its power to ensure 
that future developments in europe and the world as a whole are 
based on openness mutual trust international law and universal 
values 
the recent meeting in paris of heads of state and government 
from the european nations the united states and canada embodying 
all the best elements in international movements such as the 
helsinki process has established the framework for a europe based 
on the rule of law stability good relations between neighboring 
countries and humane attitudes it is my hope that such a europe 
will be understood and accepted by nations and governments in other 
parts of the world as an example of universal security and genuine 
cooperation 
the nobel peace prize for 1990 confirms that perestroika and 
innovative political thinking no longer belong only to us the 
people of the soviet union they are the property of the whole of 
mankind and are an inseparable part of its destiny and of a safe 
and peaceful future we are deeply grateful to norway and other 
members of the international community who have shown such 
understanding and who through their conduct in international 
issues and in their relations with the soviet union have shown 
their solidarity as we proceed with our perestroika and their 
sympathy as we struggle to resolve our problems 
if we all took this as our point of departure mankind would 
have no cause to regret the loss of a unique opportunity for reason 
and the logic of peace to prevail over that of war and alienation

the supreme court today refused to postpone a 
jan 22 election under a redistricting plan designed to help elect 
an hispanic to the los angeles county board of supervisors for the 
first time in 115 years 
the court rejected an emergency request by board members who 
said the plan ordered by a federal judge is unlawful 
the justices oowever took no action on a formal appeal by 
board members still pending before the high court 
the fivemember board controlled by conservatives was accused 
by hispanics in 1988 of violating their rights by drawing districts 
after the 1980 census that allegedly diluted hispanic voting 
strength 
the lawsuit against the board said the district lines violated 
constitutional rights assuring equal protection for all and a 1982 
federal voting rights law the law forbids not only intentional 
discrimination but also any practice that has the effect of 
weakening the voting strength of minorities 
us district judge david v kenyon declared the former district 
plan unconstitutional he carved out a new district in which 
hispanics account for an estimated 51 percent of the registered 
voters and 71 percent of the population 
kenyon ruled that when the board redrew districts after the 1980 
census members fragmented the hispanic vote in an effort to help 
their own reelection chances 
the number of hispanics living in what constitutes the district 
created by kenyon has increased dramatically in the last decade 
the board member now representing the new district is retiring 
the county has a population of about 85 million people and the 
board of supervisors has considerable power over such matters as 
planning and development 
the bush administration sided with hispanic rights groups in 
urging the supreme court not to disturb kenyons ruling which was 
upheld last month by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
the cases are los angeles county vs garza 90849 a422

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration for its views on whether a civil war era law enacted 
primarily to protect freed slaves bans racially discriminatory 
firings 
the justices said they want to hear from justice department 
lawyers about a ruling that the manufacturer of buster brown shoes 
was guilty of illegal racial bias when it fired a white supervisor 
at a missouri warehouse 
the court is not expected to say whether it will review the case 
until hearing from the government lawyers which could take months 
kenneth hicks worked for the brown shoe company for 34 years 
his assignment when fired in 1982 had been as evening shift foreman 
at a warehouse in benton mo 
the company in trimming its workforce dismissed hicks while 
keeping another supervisor alvin chester who is black 
hicks said he was fired because of his race even though he had 
more seniority than chester 
hicks testified that when he asked a boss at the warehouse if 
race was behind the firing the boss smirked and said you said 
that not me 
hicks also cited evidence that the company had an affirmative 
action plan aimed at promoting more blacks to supervisory jobs 
company officials said they chose to retain chester because he 
had more experience and was better qualified for the specific job 
both men were doing 
a federal jury ordered the company to pay hicks 10000 in 
punitive damages and the 8th us circuit court of appeals in 
april awarded him nearly 21000 more in attorney fees and other 
legal costs 
the appeals court said a civil rights law enacted in 1866 
forbids racially discriminatory firings 
the law was the focus of a highly publicized supreme court 
ruling in 1989 
the justices said the law does not ban onthejob racial 
harassment but they upheld a 1976 ruling that the law does permit 
lawsuits against private individuals or companies accused of bias 
in the making and enforcing of contracts 
left unanswered was whether the law specifically applies to 
racially biased firings 
the 8th circuit court said last years high court ruling is 
unclear adding we simply decline to overrule the clear and 
undisputed precedent of this circuit 
the appeals court with jurisdiction in seven midwestern states 
said firing is fundamentally different from racial harassment or 
discrimination in the terms or conditions of employment 
discriminatory discharge goes to the very existence and nature of 
the employment contract 
the states in the 8th circuit are arkansas iowa minnesota 
missouri nebraska north dakota and south dakota 
the case is brown group inc vs hicks 90324

bethlehem today and the towns palestinian mayor condemned a 
bombing that killed an israeli soldier and wounded two others the 
day before 
elsewhere in the occupied lands scattered clashes broke out 
today between soldiers and stonethrowing youths and at least 12 
palestinians were wounded by army gunfire including a 14yearold 
boy who was shot in the head arab reports said 
the army said it was checking the reports 
two weeks before christmas the west bank town of bethlehem the 
site of christs birth looked like a virtual ghost town as 
soldiers manned roadblocks closed stores and ordered all 
palestinians indoors arab reports said 
in the port city of haifa comrades and relatives buried 
paratrooper guy friedman 19 the soldier killed in sundays 
pipebomb explosion on the jerusalembethlehem highway no one 
claimed responsibility for the attack 
in bethlehem photographers said about half a dozen tourist 
buses incluing one with a group from denver arrived under 
military escort and visited the church of nativity built at the 
spot where tradition says christ was born 
the army imposed the curfew in bethlehem sunday arab reporters 
said the curfew was the first in bethlehem since nov 15 1988 
when there was an army clampdown in all the occupied lands to 
prevent celebrations and demonstrations when the palestine 
liberation organization in algiers declared national independence 
most refugee camps in the west bank remained under curfew today 
but the army lifted curfews elsewhere in the occupied territories 
the curfews were imposed thursday to prevent violence over the 
weekend marking the third anniversary of the uprising against 
israeli occupation of lands seized in the 1967 middle east war 
bethlehem mayor elias freij condemned sundays violence 
what is depressing and increasing tension is the absence of 
any prospect of peaceful dialogue he said 
after the bombing angry residents of the jewish settlement of 
beit haggai in the west bank blocked a main road calling for 
harsher army action against palestinian activists army radio said 
settler leader aharon dom said the bombing should prompt the 
government to deport palestinian leaders 
the arabs must know that every additional cycle of terror will 
bring them to being uprooted from this land and this uprooting 
means that there will be no return dom told army radio 
army chief of staff lt gen dan shomron visited the site of the 
bombing and said it did not constitute a shift to a more violent 
phase of the palestinian uprising 
but if we are also looking at the background of radicalization 
here in the field in the context of what is happening in the world 
including the persian gulf we cannot but take into 
consideration the possibility of a change he told israel radio

prime minister chatichai choonhavan has 
pledged to form a new government that excludes a minister blamed 
for the rift between his administration and the army news reports 
said today 
chatichai was renamed prime minister sunday less than 24 hours 
after resigning in an apparent maneuver to revamp his cabinet 
which had been strongly criticized by the military 
the military had insisted he dismiss several democratically 
installed cabinet members and it made unspecified threats 
chatichai resigned knowing his reinstatement was likely and would 
let him refashion the cabinet 
government spokesman suvit yodmani said chatichai was discussing 
the new cabinet with members of his coalition and it might be two 
days before it is announced 
the nation newspaper quoted chatichai as saying his new 
government would not include deputy minister of education chalerm 
yumbamrung who has clashed with military chiefs several times this 
year 
there is nothing to worry about the military will be 
satisfied with the new government he was quoted as saying 
chatichai last reshuffled his cabinet in november and broke a 
promise he had made to the military to drop chalerm then chalerm 
was demoted to the education ministry slot but remained in the 
cabinet 
the military has in recent years voiced support for thailands 
fledgling democracy after decades of intervention but it has tried 
to maintain a position as watchdog over state and society and its 
leaders have frequently made political pronouncements

saddam husseins release of foreign hostages 
in iraq and kuwait should not raise hopes for a peaceful resolution 
of the persian gulf crisis defense secretary dick cheney said 
today 
cheney said the release of hostages was obviously very good 
news for the hostages and their families but it did not mean 
iraq is backing away from its armed occupation of kuwait 
the illegal immoral illicit act of saddam hussein in holding 
hundreds of american hostages against their will for several months 
appears to be coming to an end cheney said in remarks to a 
defense industry group 
but i dont believe saddam hussein deserves any credit for 
stopping a practice that obviously is abhorrent to the civilized 
world he has to rank as one of the worlds alltime 
hostagetakers cheney said 
iraq has continued to send reinforcements to kuwait and southern 
iraq cheney said 
in these past few days as he has released hostages he has 
simultaneously continued to build up his deployments in kuwait to 
enhance his fortifications and to add additional forces to the 
regions cheney said he has given us absolutely no indication 
whatsoever of any intention of complying with un resolutions 
requiring the iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and the restoration of 
the kuwaiti monarchy by jan 15 
cheneys remarks appeared aimed at counteracting any positive 
public reaction in the united states to the arrival home of 
hostages held in iraq and kuwait since the aug 2 invasion 
cheneys comments followed those of other toplevel bush 
administration officials who said the united states wants 
international controls over iraqs nuclear weapons and other 
sophisticated arms once the current crisis is resolved 
in spelling out the administrations reasons for committing a 
quarter of a million american troops to the gulf and threatening to 
use them against iraq cheney particularly stressed the economic 
interests at stake 
there is no naysaying the fact that one of the major concerns 
we have is the very real possibility that should saddam hussein 
succeed in his aggression should he be allowed to keep kuwait 
that he would be in a position to directly control over 20 percent 
of the worlds proven oil reserve cheney said 
the defense secretary also said a longstanding us commitment 
to preserving the independence of saudi arabia and other gulf 
states is at the heart of this 
secretary of state james a baker iii and national security 
adviser brent scowcroft spelled out the american vision of the 
persian gulfs military future sunday 
baker said kuwaits bargaining position would be aided by 
security arrangements aimed at bridling iraqs superior 
military might and its weapons of mass destruction 
thats not something we get to until after he withdraws 
baker said on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
scowcroft on nbcs meet the press said what we would 
want to see is his weapons of mass destruction programs or his 
nuclear biological and chemical programs under strict 
international supervision so that he cannot develop that kind of 
capability 
they also demanded that bakers anticipated meeting with iraqi 
president saddam hussein be held by jan 3 
the iraqi leader has offered to meet baker in baghdad on jan 12 
three days before a united nations deadline for iraq to withdraw 
from kuwait or face eviction by military force 
iraqs un ambassador abdul amir alanbari would not rule out 
a saddambaker session by jan 3 but he said that if fighting 
erupts american losses in one day could surpass total us 
casualties during the vietnam war when more than 55000 americans 
died 
that means any war would make really that region of the world 
simply hell and perhaps also the rest of the globe into a 
crisis which i dont know whether we will recover from it or not 
alanbari said on the nbc program 
baker said that when he meets with saddam he will not agree to 
an iraqi withdrawal in exchange for giving iraq a small 
oilproducing region of kuwait because to say anything else would 
be to reward an aggressor 
but baker said that if iraq withdraws completely from kuwait 
the two neighbors could negotiate to settle remaining differences 
iraq is demanding a sea lane to the persian gulf and has accused 
kuwait of plundering an oil field the two nations share along their 
common border 
alanbari said his country might accept a security arrangement 
that covered the entire persian gulf region 
but if it is just against iraq singling out iraq it is just 
simply not acceptable he said

elected by a landslide in polands first 
popular presidential vote lech walesa got right to work today on 
his pledge to build this young democracy into an economically sound 
pillar of peace 
walesa who led the decadelong struggle that ended 
authoritarian communist rule acknowledged that terribly 
difficult tasks lie ahead as he attempts to complete the painful 
transition to a marketbased economy 
i want to work because there is a lot of work to be done 
the former shipyard electrician told reporters at his gdansk 
headquarters after defeating emigre businessman stanislaw tyminski 
in sundays runoff 
prosecutors today ordered that tyminski be barred from leaving 
poland while an investigation continues into allegations he 
slandered the government during his campaign state television 
reported 
tyminski was ordered last week to appear this month for 
questioning before a prosecutor in southern poland the general 
prosecutor in warsaw said steps must be taken to assure he will 
answer the summons the television report said 
a slander case was opened against tyminski who has canadian and 
peruvian as well as polish citizenships after he said last month 
that prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki betrayed the nation by 
causing hardship and chaos with his economic reforms he accused 
the prime minister of economic treason 
meanwhile parliament speaker mikolaj kozakiewicz said today 
that walesas swearingin before the national assembly will take 
place about dec 21 the date depends on when the supreme court 
completes its review of the election 
the presidentelect went to work today in a new government car 
with three police vehicles in escort later he made a sentimental 
pilgrimage to the former lenin shipyard his former workplace and 
birthplace of solidarity 
walesa told workers he wouldnt forget that he once wore 
overalls 
i am going to return here often he said 
the solidarity chiefs margin of victory was 74 percent to 25 
percent for tyminski according to full unofficial results released 
today by the national election commission it said walesa received 
106 million votes to 37 million votes for his opponent 
two bitter and divisive rounds of voting strained the nation 
splintering the solidarity movement a year after poland ousted the 
communists and embarked on the most ambitious economic reform plan 
in eastern europe 
walesa said he would decide by wednesday which of seven possible 
candidates to select to succeed mazowiecki the former walesa ally 
was eliminated by tyminski in the nov 25 first round of 
presidential voting 
in a taped address to the nation sunday night walesa repeated 
his campaign theme of speeding up the dismantling of 
communistcollectived industries and encouraging private 
enterprise 
in poland there is enough work for everyone we must change 
and modernize much he said europe will appreciate us for 
this an economically developed poland will be one of the pillars 
of peace and calm in europe whereas a poor poland will meet a wall 
of disapproval at all borders 
i hope to be a good sheriff determined strong and 
effective walesa told a news conference earlier some mazowiecki 
supporters have accused the vocational school graduate of 
demagoguery and promising more than he could possibly deliver 
walesa sipped champagne for the tv cameras and gave an awkward 
but affectionate kiss to his wife danuta at the insistence of 
photographers 
newspaper editor adam michnik a mazowiecki ally who has 
bitterly accused walesa of demagogic tendencies promised loyal 
opposition 
writing today in his paper gazeta wyborcza michnik described 
walesa as an outstanding politician who had to decide which 
course he would pursue as president the rhetoric of promises 
the principles of courtly rule the philosophy of decrees and the 
ax or realism responsibility respect for pluralism and the 
philosophy of the state of law 
turnout in sundays vote was about 53 percent compared to about 
60 percent in the first round 
tyminskis best showing was among rural voters where he 
obtained about 35 percent the challenger who returned to poland in 
september after 21 years in peru and canada had promised prosperity 
in a month finding support in people frustrated by economic 
hardship and rising unemployment 
there are many people in poland for whom it is really bad 
walesa said we must make poland such that those doubters 
quickly join us because we need them 
tyminski declined to concede defeat immediately saying voters 
had been intimidated by walesas camp journalists noticed no signs 
of irregularities 
the feud between walesa and mazowiecki split the solidarity 
movement but after the first round of voting walesa won the 
backing of the roman catholic church and virtually all political 
and social organizations 
for walesa 47 the presidency culminates an astonishing 
personal voyage from the middle child of a dirtpoor peasant 
family to belweder palace seat of polish presidents 
his union offices are just steps from the shipyard where walesa 
leaped into history as the charismatic leader of nationwide strikes 
that shook the communist firmament in august 1980 
outgoing president wojciech jaruzelski the general and former 
communist leader who interned walesa under martial law nine years 
ago this month was among the first to send congratulations 
on tuesday walesa is to travel like polish kings before him 
to the jasna gora monastery in czestochowa to pledge fealty to the 
nation in front of the painting of the black madonna polands most 
revered icon

the supreme court agreed today to decide 
whether prison inmates sometimes are entitled to jury trials when 
suing prison officials over alleged mistreatment 
the justices said it will hear an appeal by john j mccarthy 
who accused officials at a state prison in somers conn of 
violating his rights when they removed him from his cell in 1983 
he said officials used excessive force in using tear gas to get 
him out of his cell he also alleged that they planted a knife in 
his cell as a pretext for removing him 
mccarthy initially agreed to have a federal magistrate decide 
his case but later changed his mind 
us district judge jose a cabranes ruled that mccarthy had 
given up his right to a jury trial and assigned the case to 
magistrate f owen eagan 
the magistrate after conducting eight days of hearings at the 
prison in 1988 recommended that cabranes rule in favor of the 
prison officials and the judge agreed 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the judges ruling 
the appeals court said cabranes acted properly in rejecting 
mccarthys request to have a jury decide the case against the 
officials 
federal law authorizes federal judges to assign to magistrates 
cases in which prisoners say their rights are violated by 
conditions of confinement the judge can designate a magistrate 
even if the officials and prisoners object 
the supreme court said it will decide whether the same rule 
applies when a prisoner alleges a specific episode of allegedly 
unconstitutional conduct rather than continuing prison 
conditions 
the case is mccarthy vs bronson 905635

some americans told tales of

limoges china and drank from crystal glasses 
i had the irony of living in these ungodly opulent 
conditions he said it was bizarre it was like a fellini 
movie 
but the 42yearold from orinda calif was no less a hostage 
of saddam hussein than terrence dupuis 53 who had to stomach 
rotten food and a hole in the ground for a toilet 
both recounted their days in captivity after a night enjoying 
what was for dupuis the luxury of a comfortable bed at a hotel in 
frankfurt where they arrived after midnight sunday on a flight 
from baghdad 
on monday morning more than 150 hostages and family members 
most of them american had a breakfast feast of real scrambled 
eggs bacon hash browns orange juice and coffee

teddy kolleks pet word for the day was 
silly mild by the standards of the blunttalking jerusalem 
mayor 
a cabinet minister making his home in the moslem quarter 
silly a pledge by prime minister yitzhak shamir to build yet 
another jewish housing project in arab east jerusalem silly 
his own decision to run for mayor 25 years ago the 
silliest 
teddy kollek will be 80 in may and is showing no inclination 
toward imminent retirement 
up at dawn at work until near midnight he gives new meaning to 
the word indefatigable his bustling frame and thick hair 
havent changed in years he is one of the worlds bestknown 
mayors with an office full of teddy bears sent by admirers 
the oct 8 blood bath on the temple mount has plunged jerusalem 
into its worst crisis in 23 years but it hasnt dimmed kolleks 
enthusiasm for the city 
after the killing of at least 17 palestinians by police 
confronting a stonethrowing mob kollek sounded angry and 
selfcritical 
in an interview with the maariv newspaper he railed at the 
government for failing to treat the arabs as equals and at himself 
for not doing enough for them 
for the jews i did something but for the arab east 
nothing enough blahblah what have i done schools nothing 
sidewalks nothing cultural centers nothing he stormed 
but later in an interview at his city hall office he seemed 
calmer 
i think it will take a long time until it gets back to where 
it was he said it was a very traumatic event 
but he saw signs that the dust was settling 
arabs who boycotted the municipality immediately after the 
shootings were trickling back looking for help with their problems 
he said he pointed to small gestures arabs who spotted a bomb 
and called the police arabs who rescued a jewish family from a 
mob he wants to give them medals for public service but the 
arabs he says fear the publicity 
the palestinian vengeance attacks that followed the temple mount 
killings began with three jews knifed to death in jerusalem 
although the stabbings spread around the country it was 
jerusalems image that took the worst beating tourists both 
foreign and israeli have stayed away in droves 
shlomo lahat mayor of tel aviv came here with 1400 
schoolchildren the other day as part of jerusalem especially 
now a campaign to demonstrate solidarity with the city i am a 
jerusalemite declared lahat borrowing from the late john f 
kennedys celebrated phrase ich bin ein berliner 
im very moved even though that usually doesnt happen to 
me kollek replied people are afraid of coming to jerusalem 
these days its no secret 
in an israel increasingly drawn to mystic nationalism kollek 
remains a convinced pragmatist a throwback to the deeds not 
words philosophy of his mentor david bengurion 
the realist in kollek tells him that managing a city of jews and 
arabs in the cockpit of the mideast conflict requires a hard head 
and a feel for compromise hence he has little patience for 
rhetoric 
you have to work with tweezers he says you cant do 
anything with grand declarations i can do lots of little 
things that together amount to something i think this is the only 
way 
he blames many of jerusalems problems on heavyhanded 
government and an israeli tendency to approach every problem 
with an open mouth but he faults the foreign media for treating 
jerusalem as though it was the only city in the world with communal 
strife 
i was terribly encouraged by a silly affair by the fight 
between montreal and the mohawks about a golf course he 
remarked its ridiculous right 
kollek lists various concessions made by israel after it 
captured jerusalem from the attacking jordanian army in 1967 a 
semifree arabic press a choice of israeli or jordanian 
citizenship arab curricula in schools and moslem control of access 
to their holy places 
the trouble he says is that these are now taken for granted 
another problem may be that not all israelis are blessed or 
cursed with kolleks ability to see both sides of the problem 
we cant put ourselves into the shoes of other people he 
said either we are unable to or we dont want to

some of the mule deer and antelope in 
utahs desert are surviving thanks to space technology 
hercules corp has donated more than 100 surplus casings for 
solid fuel rockets to the state division of wildlife resources 
since 1978 for a program aimed at supplying water to animals in 
otherwise inhospitable areas 
the casings serve as tanks nicknamed guzzlers to capture 
and store rain water in areas that receive only 6 to 8 inches of 
precipitation a year they attract wildlife to areas that otherwise 
might be avoided said jay roberson upland game program 
coordinator for the division 
theyve opened up millions of acres he said 
the rocket casings are buried on public land beneath a funnel 
or catch basin that captures rain a pipe or hose feeds the stored 
water to a trough through a valve that opens when animals drink 
the state still has to pay for other materials and install the 
guzzlers but officials say the tanks generally are the most costly 
part the price can exceed 10000 
the state has saved over 400000 by using the cases instead 
of buying new materials said biologist dean mitchell 
in the past hercules had to cut up surplus rocket motor casings 
and send them to a landfill said company engineer richard cloward 
who also is vice president of the utah wildlife leadership 
coalition 
its crazy to spend money to cut those things up just to 
facilitate burying them he said 
john waugman environmental engineer at hercules said the huge 
casings generally are made of fiberglass graphite or kevlar a 
material used in bulletproof vests theyre usually stronger than 
steel 
it doesnt deteriorate cloward said 
it will be there long after you and i are gone added 
waugman 
hercules produces rocket motors for the defense department and 
the space program including the titan and titan iv delta ii 
trident ii the midgetman small intercontinental ballistic missile 
and pegasus 
waugman said the donated casings were never filled with rocket 
fuel he and cloward also said hercules has run tests to ensure 
that nothing from the tanks gets into the water or leaches into the 
ground 
roberson is unable to document whether the tanks have been 
responsible for increased populations of animals but his general 
impression is that the range has more animals because there is more 
water 
thats our belief and thats our observation he said we 
believe it enough that we are willing to continue maintaining the 
guzzlers 
there are the skeptics who say show me the data roberson 
said but when we say how much money it would take to do the 
study you could put in a lot of water to research that

the only thing white about 
christmas here is the desert sand 
families and loved ones are far away for the american military 
personnel deployed in operation desert shield 
outward christmas displays are barred so as not to offend the 
islamic sensibilities of the saudi arabians 
twinkling lights dont go with military tents 
its enough to give the toughest troops the christmas blues but 
a psychologist says desert shield wont be completely barren of 
holiday cheer 
there will be kind of a blue haze over everything its kind 
of a funk said capt frank mullins 54 of mobile ala a 
psychologist at the us navys fleet no 5 hospital 
but the average person will find a lot of solace being among 
friends sharing christmas dinne singing a couple of carols he 
said 
what helps people get through the holidays are personal things 
sent from home a card a trinket a snapshot christmas music 
yule decorations mullins said 
army maj doug bidle of chicago received a candy cane house 
complete with fake snow and an artificial tree from his wife 
navy petty officer diane escobar of austin texas has a 
nativity scene and a paratrooper in the armys 82nd airborne 
division was mailed the artificial tree his father had in vietnam 
the troops here should try to have as normal a christmas as 
they can with as many customs and rituals as they can get from 
home mullins said 
people are upset dont get me wrong if you dont feel upset 
maybe theres something wrong with you he said they may get 
depressed they may cry a little bit but theyll be fine the next 
day 
we dont expect to be overflowing with psychiatric casualties 
on christmas day 
whats also absent in saudi arabia is spiked eggnog and 
alcoholic spirits because liquor is banned in saudi arabia 
but mullins said the absence of booze a depressant is one of 
the reasons why the mood of the troops has been so good despite the 
desert life scorpions vipers isolation and harsh living 
conditions 
ill be the first to say im glad theres no alcohol he 
said what it does is cut down on the mental health business 
weve had surprisingly little business 
the truth of the matter is the mental health of many of troops 
is going to improve mullins said they can cope with normal 
developmental pressures without alcohol 
theyre going to find they can engage in more adult behavior 
and operate in their environment more realistically 
most of the problems troops have sought help for are personal 
ones the dear john letters the death of a loved one back home 
the first child born while a serviceman is on desert duty 
the military recognizes that stress fatigue and anxiety can be 
daily enemies than can dull the fighting edge of young service 
members 
the kids were seeing are not bitching about living in the 
sand mullins said the harshness of the living conditions 
since weve been here has not been that big a problem 
how many times have you heard that morale is good when people 
are bitching when people get too depressed to bitch youve got 
problems they withdraw socially go into themselves 
whats important is the coping skills that people develop from 
the hardships the psychologist said 
for a lot of young men here this may be the major growth 
experience in their lives mullins said dont forget world 
war ii was that way for the people whore now 60 years old

a toplevel review of the nations space 
program recommended today that space shuttle flights be confined 
only to those that require human involvement and that the proposed 
space station be redesigned from top to bottom 
a committee of experts said some of the concerns expressed about 
the national aeronautics and space administration are deserved 
and occasionally even selfinflicted 
their report was released after vice president dan quayle and 
nasa administrator richard truly were briefed on its contents the 
12member committee which has been studying the space program for 
four months was headed by norman r augustine chairman and chief 
executive officer of the martin marietta corp 
nasa has received heavy criticism this year particularly after 
shuttles were grounded for five months by leaks and by the 
inability of the 15 billion hubble space telescope to see the 
universe as sharply as advertised 
the committee was asked whether some new form of management 
structure was called for but it said changes of such sweeping 
scope are inappropriate 
in spite of imperfections by far the greatest body of space 
expertise in any single organization in the world resides within 
nasa the report said 
briefly stated the committee believes that nasa and only 
nasa realistically possesses the essential critical mass of 
knowledge and expertise upon which the nations civil space program 
can be sustained 
the committee said nasa should start immediately to phase out 
some of its missions on the space shuttle and transfer them to a 
new unmanned launch vehicle that would be developed 
the report said the civil space program is overly dependent on 
the shuttle for access to space and warned that statistically we 
are likely to lose another space shuttle in the next several 
years 
it said therefore that the shuttle should be used only for 
those missions where human involvement is necessary 
the committee believes in hindsight that it was for example 
inappropriate in the case of challenger to risk the lives of seven 
astronauts and nearly onefourth of nasas launch assets to place 
in orbit a communications satellite the report said 
quayle called the report a tremendous effort and said the 
committee will be reconvened in six months to assess what progress 
has been made 
truly said nasa and i intend to take each of these 
recommendations most seriously 
there was no immediate response from nasa most of the top 
officials of the space agency met with the vice president 
nasa and quayle who is head of the national space council have 
been at odds over the future of the program and the committee was 
set up to respond to those concerns 
the committee recommended that the priorities of the space 
program be shifted to place primary emphasis on science it also 
recommended that the space station be redesigned to lessen 
complexity and reduce cost taking whatever time may be required 
to do this thoroughly and innovatively 
the first construction flight for the station has been scheduled 
for 1995 but congress has balked at the cost of the station and 
ordered nasa to cut back 
the committee included former nasa administrator thomas paine 
former air force secretary edward c pete aldridge jr and 
former astronaut joseph allen it offered to meet again in six 
months if nasa wants

a natural gas explosion rocked an apartment 
complex at an army base killing a 5yearold girl and injuring 17 
residents and rescuers authorities said 
the girls remains were discovered in the rubble of the building 
at 930 am today about 12 hours after it blew up officials at 
fort benjamin harrison said 
the blast occurred hours after fire authorities arrived to 
investigate a gas leak at another building in the complex that 
building was being evacuated when the blast hit several hundred 
feet away authorities said 
the explosion in a housing area for enlisted personnel 
destroyed a fourfamily housing unit and damaged another unit said 
post spokesman maj ronald downing 
the fire engines were trying to get in and we were trying to 
get out it was total chaos said joan adams a resident of the 
complex she described people running through streets in their 
pajamas carrying children 
at least 17 residents and firefighters were injured by midday 
today three people were still listed in critical condition one of 
them a 4yearold girl authorities said 
marion county deputy coroner charles w green said he could not 
conclusively identify the dead child until after dental records 
were checked but base officials said there was little doubt it was 
the 5yearold girl who had been reported missing earlier 
firefighters and police called off their search through the 
smoldering rubble after the body was found the girls identity was 
not released other members of her family were among the injured 
downing said 
the post on the edge of town serves as a processing center for 
soldiers en route to the persian gulf although none of those 
soldiers stayed in the affected area 
fire authorities had been called in about 545 pm or 3 hours 
before the blast after people reported smelling gas downing said 
he said officials had planned to evacuate the 240unit harrison 
village complex before the explosion 
harley said authorities turned the gas off at one housing unit 
where they thought the leak was occurring but a nearby unit where 
the gas had not been turned off blew up he said 
some residents complained that they were not adequately warned 
adams whose husband is a sergeant said that about two hours 
before the explosion military police began telling residents that 
a gas leak had been found elsewhere in the complex and would be 
fixed 
he told us there was no danger for us to stay there she 
said her family had planned to leave anyway because the complex 
was without heat and hot water but the explosion happened before 
they did so she said 
lt col bill carey provost marshal said the building where 
the leak was detected was evacuated as a precaution but we 
didnt feel the whole area needed to be evacuated 
however the blast occurred in another building about 800 to 
1000 feet away he said adding that prior to the explosion we 
had not been to this building 
the blast was felt more than two miles away wood and other 
debris were scattered where a twostory building once stood rubble 
was strewn over four blocks about 210 families were evacuated 
after the explosion 
insulation was coming down like snow when we got here one 
apartment was engulfed in flames and the other building was in 
flames said state trooper anthony blackburn

garbage bags began mounding on streets outside 
fastfood establishments today as garbage collectors struck the 
private carting companies that pick up trash from 250000 
businesses 
no emergencies were reported on the first morning of missed 
pickups but the city sanitation department was ready to collect 
garbage at any business sites where health or fire hazards were 
certified 
a 2100member teamsters local called the strike sunday after 
union members rejected a second contract offer picket lines went 
up sunday night 
the haulers pick up 10000 tons of garbage daily from 
restaurants factories and other businesses as well as 
construction sites the strike affects 475 carting companies with 
total operations worth more than 1 billion a year 
collections of residential garbage the province of the 
sanitation department was not affected by the strike 
the walkout began officially sunday night and the union said 
this morning it was largely effective but some trucks were making 
pickups in the bronx 
they went out with management people and with scabs and they 
have a lot of police protection said bernard adelstein 
secretarytreasurer of teamsters local 813 
the union represents collectors in new york city and adjoining 
suburban counties adelstein said no decision had been made yet on 
whether the walkout will be spread to those counties westchester 
and putnam he said there was no chance of a strike on long island 
where contracts run to 1992 
this morning little garbage was visible on such main midtown 
thoroughfares as broadway and sixth avenue but accumulations began 
appearing at curbside and against buildings on the side streets at 
one spot between two high turnover restaurants on 48th street at 
broadway and seventh avenue the black plastic garbage bags 
narrowed the passageway for pedestrians 
jim grossman a spokesman for the uniformed sanitationmens 
association which represents 7000 municipal garbage collectors 
said the union will not pick up the businesses trash without the 
city declaring a health emergency 
such a declaration would obligate the union to pick up the 
trash he said 
but he said its wintertime and the garbage can sit outside a 
long time before it creates a health problem 
the unions last strike was in the winter of 1981 and lasted 17 
days the city declared a health emergency the day before it was 
settled 
the teamsters rejected the first contract offer dec 2 but 
postponed their strike deadline by one week at the request of mayor 
david dinkins 
the union demanded a threeyear contract with 8 percent wage 
increases each year about 60 a week and improved pension and 
welfare benefits said secretarytreasurer bernard adelstein 
workers earn about 40000 a year 
the offer rejected dec 2 called for no pay increase the first 
year 25 a week in the second and 35 a week in the third 
the proposal rejected sunday offered slightly more union 
officials said the old contract expired nov 30 
no negotiations were scheduled

if saddam husseins forces are left 
intact after he is forced out of kuwait he will claim the late 
gamal abdel nassers mantle as the champion of the arab world 
saudis fear 
saudi officials speaking monday on condition of anonymity 
echoed the concern voiced a day earlier by us secretary of state 
james baker iii baker said that even a peaceful solution to the 
gulf crisis would be followed by continued pressure on saddam to 
curb his military power 
he cant keep his military hell be a hero hell make nasser 
in 1956 look like mickey mouse said one saudi source 
nasser the populist egyptian president who died in 1970 became 
an idol in the arab world after standing up to the french and 
british forces backing israel in the 1956 attempt to reverse his 
nationalization of the suez canal 
he used his panarab nationalism to appeal to public opinion 
across north africa and the middle east destablizing many 
prowestern governments in the process his memory remains a potent 
force in the arab world today 
the saudis see history repeating itself in saddams vast 
military arsenal and political ambitions 
saddam has the biggest and most powerful army in the arab world 
with a million troops a missile armory and other weapons of mass 
destruction 
most officials expect he will find a way to extricate himselffrom iraq 
before being attacked by the 26nation alliance that 
began deploying troops to saudi arabia soon after kuwait was 
invaded aug 2 
but even after a retreat saddam will say he stood up not just 
to the united states but to the whole world a saudi source 
said 
the future threat would be both political and military saddams 
invasion of kuwait an emirate disliked by poor arabs for its vast 
oil wealth and limited rights for foreign workers struck a popular 
chord in many parts of the arab world 
it added to his claim of achieving a victory against iran a 
traditional arab enemy in the 198088 war despite having gained 
nothing in the end 
they just love this white stallion stuff saladin and all 
that said an asian diplomat referring to the arab general who 
in 1187 recaptured jerusalem from the european crusaders 
saddam who likens himself to the kurdish saladin is often 
shown on iraqi television heroically mounted on a white charger 
arabs will say hes tough he can solve our problems lets 
follow him the diplomat added 
saddam has already tried to capitalize on that image with his 
attempt to link his withdrawal to an israeli pullout from the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
occupying another arab land and torturing arabs does not give 
hope that the palestinians can be liberated said a senior saudi 
diplomat 
the saudis are concerned that what saddam does not gain through 
charisma he can achieve through the threat of force especially if 
he develops nuclear weapons within the next few years 
they dont want un economic sanctions against iraq eases 
unless iraq reduces the size and power of his military or at least 
makes unbacked guarantees not to use its arms again on fellow 
arabs 
we cant just stop at the withdrawal the iraqi army has to be 
reduced to a degree that it wont threaten us said the senior 
diplomat 
the saudis despite buying billions of dollars worth of 
advanced weaponry over the last decade found themselves hopelessly 
unable to combat saddam when he invaded kuwait 
the saudis have embarked on a crash expansion of their military 
and are buying weapons worth billions of dollars but analysts say 
that even when that program is completed they will still not be 
able to defend themselves without outside help

the supreme court agreed today to decide 
whether news media organizations enjoy any constitutional 
protection against being sued over broken promises of 
confidentiality 
the justices said they will consider reinstating a 200000 
award against minnesotas two largest newspapers won by a news 
source whose identity was not kept confidential the award had been 
thrown out by the minnesota supreme court 
public relations man dan cohen initially won a 700000 award 
against the star tribune of minneapolisst paul and the st paul 
pioneer press dispatch 
a state appeals court ruled that a promise of confidentiality 
given to cohen by a reporter with each newspaper amounted to an 
oral contract but cut the award to 200000 cohens victory was 
overturned completely by the state supreme court last july 
in other action the court 
gave federal judges more power to decide lawsuits stemming 
from labor disputes 
the court unanimously reinstated a suit by two workers fired by 
a michigan company ring screw works the workers sued after losing 
grievances against the company 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said the 
federal labor relations management act gives judges authority to 
rule in such cases unless the collective bargaining agreement 
between a union and management expressly forbids it 
agreed to judge the validity of federal guidelines for 
sentencing people convicted of trafficking in the hallucinogenic 
drug lsd 
the justices said they will decide whether the sentencing 
guidelines now based on the weight of the lsd and its carrier 
must instead be based on the number of doses confiscated 
asked the bush administration for its views on whether a civil 
war era law enacted primarily to protect freed slaves bans racially 
discriminatory firings 
the justices said they want to hear from justice department 
lawyers about a ruling that the manufacturer of buster brown shoes 
was guilty of illegal racial bias when it fired a white supervisor 
at a missouri warehouse 
agreed to decide whether prison inmates sometimes are entitled 
to jury trials when suing prison officials over alleged 
mistreatment 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by john j mccarthy 
who accused officials at a state prison in somers conn of 
violating is rights when they removed him from his cell in 1983 
refused to postpone a jan 22 election under a redistricting 
plan designed to help elect an hispanic to the los angeles county 
board of supervisors for the first time in 115 years 
the court rejected an emergency request by board members who 
said the plan ordered by a federal judge is unlawful 
in the confidentiality case cohens attorney elliot 
rothenberg expressed pleasure at the supreme courts decision to 
take it up the major issue will be to what extent does the 
first amendment of the constitution apply to contract law he 
said does it give newspapers the right to dishonor promises or 
violate oral contracts with confidential sources 
attorneys for the newspapers said they had not seen the courts 
order and could not immediately comment on it 
the controversy stems from a revelation during the 1982 
minnesota political campaign that marlene johnson a democratic 
farm labor candidate for lieutenant governor once had been 
arrested and charged with shoplifting 
cohen who was associated with the campaign of wheelock whitney 
the independentrepublican candidate for governor provided the 
information on the condition he not be identified as the source 
reporters for the two papers gave that assurance but their 
editors ordered that cohens name be published because they said 
the public should be told that the information came from someone 
linked to whitneys campaign 
the same day he was named as the source in the newspaper stories 
about johnson cohen was fired from his advertising agency job 
in voting 42 to throw out cohens ensuing lawsuit against the 
newspapers the state supreme court drew a distinction between 
moral and legal obligations it said promises of confidentiality 
did not amount to oral contracts 
to impose a contract theory on this arrangement puts an 
unwarranted legal rigidity on a special ethical relationship the 
state court said 
the state court also rejected arguments that cohen was entitled 
to collect monetary damages under a more general legal theory 
governing broken promises 
enforcement of the promise of confidentiality under such a 
theory would violate defendants first amendment rights the 
state court said 
the constitutions first amendment guarantees freedom of the 
press 
minnesotas highest court added there may be instances where 
a confidential source would be entitled to a remedy when the 
states interest in enforcing the promise to the source outweighs 
first amendment considerations but this is not such a case 
the two dissenting state court justices called the ruling a 
sad day in the history of a responsible press in america 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for cohen argued this 
court has not before accorded media organizations a constitutional 
privilege to break promises or contracts with others or to be 
immune from generally applicable laws no one including the news 
media should be above the law 
lawyers for the two newspapers urged the justices to reject 
cohens appeal 
the case is cohen vs cowles media co 90634

the first wave of american hostages freed under saddam husseins 
blanket release headed home today but even as it relented and 
released foreign captives iraq declared it would not compromise 
one iota over kuwait 
us consular officials in germany said 152 americans and four 
canadians left frankfurt on a pan am flight headed for andrews air 
force base near washington provisions aboard included hamburgers 
and champagne 
while expressing relief at the freeing of the hostages the bush 
administration wants nothing less than iraqs total withdrawal from 
kuwait 
but the baghdad governments information minister latif jassim 
said today any talk of an iraqi withdrawal from the emirate was 
nothing but dreams and wishful thinking 
kuwait is for iraqi whether in the past present or future 
jassim said in a statement carried by the official iraqi news 
agency 
we will not compromise one iota on kuwaiti territory its 
waters or the money and investment of the buried alsabah 
dynasty he said referring to kuwaits deposed ruling family 
the bush administration is urging a meeting between president 
saddam and james a baker iii by jan 3 so iraq would have time to 
pull out by jan 15 the deadline set in the un resolution 
authorizing force to drive iraq from kuwait 
in the hostage exodus an iraqi airlines jet left baghdad for 
london today carrying 384 westerners including 277 britons and 
some americans the exact number of americans on the 
britishchartered flight was not immediately known 
fourteen other westerners a canadian seven irishmen five 
britons and a dutchman flew to amman jordan earlier today 
aboard a scheduled iraqi airways flight 
the americans who left frankfurt today were among about 175 
former captives who had arrived a day earlier from baghdad aboard a 
uschartered iraqi airways jet some spoke of hiding barefoot in 
kuwait city apartments others of being held captive in gulags 
at strategic sites around iraq 
the flight from baghdad also included 101 former british 
hostages who were flown this morning from frankfurt to london 
where they were greeted by jubilant relatives and government 
officials 
i feel euphoric said one of the freed british captives 
45yearold harvey may 
us officials said they planned to charter another flight in 
three or four days to evacuate the rest of the estimated 750 
americans in iraq and kuwait 
twentyone former american hostages landed in houston on sunday 
they left baghdad on saturday aboard a jet chartered by former 
treasury secretary john connally who was in iraq on a private 
mission to free hostages 
about 8000 westerners had been prevented from leaving iraq and 
kuwait since iraq overran kuwait on aug 2 including about 600 who 
were held at strategic sites to guard against a feared attack by 
usled forces 
saddam announced thursday that they could all go home 
the move came a week after the un security council approved 
the useofforce resolution which president bush followed up by 
inviting iraq to exchange envoys in an effort to avoid war 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz plans to visit washington for 
a meeting with bush possibly on dec 17 bakers trip to baghdad 
would follow some time later but iraqi and us officials have yet 
to agree on a date 
baker said that if saddam does not agree to a meeting by jan 3 
it will show the iraqi leader is not serious about averting war 
a meeting jan 12 as proposed by baghdad would not give iraq 
enough time to withdraw from its oilrich neighbor before the jan 
15 deadline baker said 
the iraqi ambassador to the united nations abdul amir 
alanbari said the meeting might be scheduled earlier speaking on 
nbctvs meet the press he said the disagreement over 
scheduling was a minute one 
british and arab newspapers reported sunday that iraq had 
redrawn its border with kuwait in possible preparation for a 
partial pullout from kuwait 
the reports in the observer of london and the alkhaleej daily 
in abu dhabi said saddams aim was to keep the entire rumailah 
oilfield and two islands warba and bubiyan which would give it 
open access to the persian gulf the oilfield which lies chiefly 
in iraq extends two miles into kuwait and saddam accused kuwait of 
overexploiting it before he invaded 
the weekly observer citing unidentified arab sources in 
washington said most arab governments expect iraq to withdraw 
from the rest of kuwait in late january but completion of a new 
border fence around rumailahs southern time indicates an even 
earlier withdrawal 
baker said that in his meeting with saddam he would not agree to 
give iraq all of rumailah because to say anything else would be 
to reward an aggressor 
baker predicted the public would support using force even if 
iraq demanded only a small part of kuwait because americans would 
want to stand up against international outlaws like this man 
the united states has 250000 troops in the gulf and plans to 
build that force up to 400000 by midjanuary the antiiraq 
coalition includes an estimated 100000 troops from other nations

hes been called the mayor of capitol hill 
the democrats mr goodwrench mr fixit the prince of perks 
theyre all appropriate descriptions of rep vic fazio of 
california congress point man when it comes to securing pay 
raises and financing incumbents builtin advantages over their 
challengers 
and hes sick of them 
it is not a very clear picture of me its very 
onedimensional my interests have been much broader he 
complains 
breaking loose fazio has parlayed the points he scored as mr 
inside for a shot at mr outside a chance to become a national 
mover in the democratic party house democratic colleagues last 
week elected him chairman of the democratic congressional campaign 
committee 
hell represent their interests as the party goes into the 
crucial 1992 elections many secure senior democrats are expected 
to retire as congressional district boundaries are redrawn to 
comply with the new census data 
its a job that will require an instinct for issues a mastery 
of demographic detail and a knack for emptying the wallets of 
campaign contributors 
anyone who believes fazio was given that job just because he 
helped secure members a big pay raise last year would be wrong 
theyd also be wrong if they thought that had nothing to do with 
it 
the fact is that democrats see fazio as a jockey who can ride 
any horse to victory even the ugly ones and sometimes he seems to 
ride more than one at a time 
in 12 years in the house fazio 48 has never limited himself 
to the insider tasks for which he is known 
hes done everything from fighting for cutbacks in the mx 
missile system to securing tougher environmental rules for 
offshore oil drilling to winning 28 billion in earthquake aid 
for his state after the 1989 san franciscoarea disaster 
at the same time he set up a political action committee to help 
fellow democrats win reelection and has headed impact 2000 the 
partys effort to prepare for the upcoming redistricting 
in the shakeup that followed the resignation of former speaker 
jim wright dtexas fazio a few years ago stepped onto the track 
that has now led him to the dccc chairmanship he became vice 
chairman of the house democratic caucus and is keeping that job 
the first time the democrats have put one person in two leadership 
posts 
if hes been labeled mr inside its his own fault 
as chairman of the legislative branch subcommittee fazio is 
responsible for daytoday budgeting of the institution hes done 
the job better than many might think prudent all the while waiting 
impatiently fingertapping impatiently for the day he can dump 
that committee chairmanship for a better one 
its as if he cant find enough things to do 
speaker thomas s foley said of fazio if i had a machine to 
clone him i would do it he is the most effective member of 
congress i ever met 
republicans are equally impressed if less complimentary house 
minority whip newt gingrich rga once called him a nice clean 
machine politician the democrats consigliere the term used 
for a trusted counselor in the mafia 
for now fazio is counseling unity for his party 
on the persian gulf he sees little room for partisan advantage 
and worries that democratic doubts could reassert that image of 
the democratic party as appeasers 
on the slumping economy he believes the traditional democratic 
answer of jobs programs is passe 
and true to form hes not afraid to talk about the 
nittygritty 
its going to be a very very bad year for fundraising for the 
house he said with house members competing for a 
theoretically finite amount of money with democratic senate and 
presidential candidates 
he expects hell need to find 60 to 75 new candidates of real 
quality people who can win the open seats created by 
retirements and the redistricting 
fazio says he considers his national party efforts totally 
really apart from the legislative branchrelated activities its 
really two different worlds and they dont overlap very much 
they do in one way the democrats are counting on him to do the 
dirty work to be their mr fixit

serbias ruling communists and their 
hardline president slobodan milosevic were headed monday for an 
election victory that could split yugoslavia apart 
as official returns trickled in from serbias first free ballot 
since 1938 the renamed socialists and milosevic took a commanding 
lead over their main challengers the centerright nationalist 
serbian renewal movement 
a victory for milosevic and his party is almost certain to 
deepen the rift between serbia and the prowestern republics of 
croatia and slovenia where centerright parties ousted communists 
in spring elections 
the opposition charged the communists with widespread 
voterigging international observers said they believed sundays 
election was essentially fair but indicated communist domination 
of serbias media made for a biased campaign 
in montenegro communists were already celebrating what they 
claimed to be an overwhelming victory over 10 opposition parties 
according to unofficial returns reported by the state tanjug news 
agency 
tanjug said the communist candidate for montenegros presidency 
momir bulatovic appeared as likely as milosevic to win outright 
without being forced into a runoff 
a runoff vote will be held dec 23 for any of the 250 parliament 
seats in serbia or 125 seats in montenegro in constituencies where 
no single candidate wins 50 percent 
all i can say is they are leading and leading well jova 
vukelic spokesman for the serbian democratic party said of 
milosevics socialists vukelic said he based his comment on 
partial results reaching his party 
tanjug said the socialists had won nearly 80 seats in the 
serbian parliament according to an unofficial survey of 140 out of 
250 districts 
initial results indicate that the communists will have at 
least a 60 percent majority over the opposition in parliament 
said dragan veselinov president of the opposition peasants party 
we should be happy if they win only 60 percent im afraid 
they could win by an even higher margin said vojislav kostunica 
of the democratic party 
the outcome of the vote in serbia is likely to decide whether 
this volatile balkan country stays together or breaks up 
the newly elected governments in slovenia and croatia advocate 
greater democracy and have threatened to secede if yugoslavias 
federation of six republics does not transform into a loose 
confederation of nearindependent states 
milosevic has refused to acknowledge the possibility of a 
federal breakup or to negotiate with the western republics 
his main rival for president vuk draskovic of the serbian 
renewal movement has said he would negotiate with croatia and 
slovenia 
electoral commission chairman caslav ignjatovic said he was 
investigating claims of ballotrigging and widespread 
irregularities at the serbian republics 9500 polling stations 
draskovic said the socialists distributed campaign leaflets at 
polling stations sunday and that progovernment media also ignored 
a ban on campaigning 48 hours before the election 
opposition leaders also claimed the socialists stopped 
registering deaths in serbia in april and rigged the election 
using phantom votes 
in terms of procedures at individual voting places the 
elections passed fairly well said robert hand an official of 
the conference on security and cooperation in europe which 
monitored the serbian elections 
our main concern is what happened before the elections hand 
said he said the group was unhappy with the limited opposition 
access to the communistcontrolled media during the campaign 
serbias statecontrolled media claimed the opposition parties 
were prowestern enemies of the republic whose victory could lead 
to civil war with other yugoslav regions 
the divisions among serbs croats and slovenes reflect the babel 
of ethnic and political forces vying for power in yugoslavia the 
us central intelligence agency predicted recently that the 
country could be torn apart within 18 months and said civil war was 
possible

the supreme court said monday it will decide 
whether news organizations enjoy some constitutional protection 
against being sued for breaking promises to keep a sources 
identity a secret 
the court voted to consider reinstating a 200000 award against 
minnesotas two largest newspapers it was won and then lost by a 
news source whose identity was not kept confidential 
the award had been thrown out by the minnesota supreme court 
before beginning a fourweek holiday recess the court also 
ruled unanimously in a michigan case that workers may sue their 
employers after losing union grievance complaints the decision 
reversed a federal appeals court ruling that a labor strike is a 
unions only recourse when its workers lose grievances 
agreed to judge in a wisconsin case the validity of federal 
guidelines for sentencing people convicted of trafficking in the 
hallucinogenic drug lsd 
refused to postpone a jan 22 election under a redistricting 
plan designed to help elect the first hispanic in 115 years to the 
los angeles county board of supervisors 
asked the bush administration in a case from missouri for its 
views on the scope of a key civil rights law forbidding racially 
discriminatory firings 
in the dispute over confidential sources public relations man 
dan cohen initially won a 700000 award against the star tribune 
of minneapolisst paul and the st paul pioneer press dispatch a 
state appeals court reduced the award to 200000 
during the 1982 minnesota political campaign cohen told 
reporters for the two papers that marlene johnson a democratic 
farm labor candidate for lieutenant governor once had been 
arrested and charged with shoplifting 
cohen who was associated with the campaign of wheelock whitney 
the independentrepublican candidate for governor provided the 
information on the condition he not be identified as the source 
reporters for the two papers gave that assurance but their 
editors ordered that cohens name be published 
the same day he was named as the source in the newspaper stories 
about johnson cohen was fired from his advertising agency job 
in voting 42 to throw out cohens ensuing lawsuit against the 
newspapers the state supreme court rejected arguments that cohen 
was entitled to collect monetary damages for the broken promise 
enforcement of the promise of confidentiality under such a 
theory would violate defendants first amendment rights the 
state court said 
the constitutions first amendment guarantees freedom of the 
press 
the two dissenting state court justices called the ruling a 
sad day in the history of a responsible press in america 
cohens lawyer elliot rothenberg said he was pleased by 
mondays court action he said the justices must decide whether the 
first amendment gives news organizations the right to dishonor 
promises or violate oral contracts with confidential sources 
the minnesota supreme court however ruled that the promise of 
confidentiality made to cohen did not amount to an oral contract 
im very surprised the justices agreed to review this case 
most of the scenarios are pretty terrible said jane kirtley of 
the washingtonbased reporters committee for freedom of the press 
the case really is about journalistic ethics not legally 
cognizable issues 
if the justices reverse the minnesota courts ruling and fail to 
make an an exception for reporters ordered by courts to divulge 
their sources she said reporters will face the choice of 
revealing a source and getting sued or not revealing a source and 
going to jail 
ms kirtley said the practical impact might not be great if the 
minnesota courts ruling were reversed in a decision that made 
clear reporters could not be sued when forced by court order to 
reveal a source 
but such a ruling would be significant as another chink out of 
the first amendment armor she said

the supreme court ruled monday that a federal 
law designed to promote labor peace gives federal judges broad 
power to resolve disputes between employers and their workers 
voting 90 the justices revived a lawsuit by two workers who 
said they were fired unjustly by ring screw works in michigan the 
workers sued after losing grievances against the company 
writing for the court justice john paul stevens said the 
federal labor relations management act empowers judges to decide 
such suits unless the collective bargaining agreement between 
workers and their employers expressly forbids it 
there is a strong presumption that favors access to a neutral 
forum for the peaceful resolution of disputes stevens said 
a contract that gives unions the right to strike and management 
the right to impose a lockout over deadlocked grievances does not 
automatically strip federal judges of authority to rule in those 
disputes he said 
the courts are barred from acting only if both sides in the 
disputes expressly agree to resort to economic warfare rather 
than to mediation arbitration or judicial review stevens said 
arthur groves was fired by ring screw works for allegedly 
excessive unexcused absences from work bobby evans was dismissed 
for allegedly falsifying company records 
both men denied the charges but lost grievance complaints 
against the company they then sued the company for firing them 
without due cause in violation of the labor relations management 
act 
the united automobile workers union joined the lawsuits on the 
side of the workers 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals last year upheld a ruling 
by a federal judge who threw out the suits 
the appeals court said the uaw contract with ring screw works 
implies that a strike is the unions only recourse when workers 
lose grievances union members voted against striking after groves 
and evans lost their grievances 
the appeals court said the workers would be permitted to sue 
only if they accused the union of breaching its duty to represent 
them fairly and the fired workers made no such claim

a top federal safety official called monday 
for a national campaign to persuade 21 remaining states to pass 
laws to immediately 
confiscate the licenses of drivers who fail or refuse 
drunkendriving tests 
james l kolstad chairman of the national transportation safety 
board told a meeting of the national commission on drunk driving 
that license confiscation is a simple direct and inexpensive 
way to attack a problem blamed for 60 deaths a day or nearly 22000 
fatalities a year 
such laws already have been passed by 29 states and the district 
of columbia and kolstad said they have resulted in substantial 
decreases of drunken driving 
kolstad noted that the deaths of eight persons in the collision 
of two northwest airlines passenger jets at detroit metropolitan 
airport a week ago flashed across the tv screens and the front 
pages of our newspapers 
and almost immediately the calls for corrective action to 
prevent that kind of accident from happening again were heard he 
said 
he said that while the response was understandable and correct 
it is disappointing that society does not get equally concerned 
when transportation deaths occur on our nations roads and 
highways 
drunk driving is one of the leading causes of death in our 
country today and it is totally preventable kolstad said 
kolstad noted that a recent safety board study found that a 
third of fatally injured truck drivers tested positive for alcohol 
or drugs 
four out of five of these drivers had a history of substance 
abuse before their fatal accidents he said 
kolstads proposal recently listed as one of the safety boards 
mostwanted safety changes would require the immediate 
confiscation of a license if a driver either fails a sobriety test 
or refuses to take one 
under the program a driver is given a temporary license and 
given the option of an administrative hearing 
that hearing establishes only one basic fact did the driver 
indeed fail the test or refuse to take it kolstad said if the 
answer is yes the drivers license is revoked on the spot 
the driver may still face criminal charges later but the 
important result is that they are taken off the road in very short 
order he said there are no appeals no dilatory tactics no 
mitigating circumstances no plea bargaining no pretrial 
diversion the drunk driver is taken off the road 
this approach works and it works well he said adding that 
it deters not only drivers found drunk behind the wheel but also 
those who have not been caught but who will fear losing their 
driving privileges 
kolstad urged a lobbying campaign to convince legislators and 
governors of the common sense necessity of administrative license 
revocation laws 
according to the safety board the 21 states which have not 
passed such laws are alabama arkansas georgia idaho kentucky 
massachusetts michigan montana nebraska new hampshire new 
jersey new york ohio pennsylvania rhode island south carolina 
south dakota tennessee texas virginia and washington

the supreme court indicated interest monday in 
an important civil rights issue whether a civil warera law 
enacted primarily to protect freed slaves bans racially 
discriminatory firings 
the justices asked the bush administration for its views on the 
issue urging justice department lawyers to comment on a ruling 
that the manufacturer of buster brown shoes was guilty of illegal 
racial bias when it fired a white supervisor at a missouri 
warehouse 
after hearing from the government lawyers which could be months 
away the court will decide whether it wants to hear the case 
kenneth hicks a white foreman with the brown shoe company was 
fired in 1982 after 34 years with the firm 
the company in trimming its work force dismissed hicks while 
keeping another supervisor alvin chester who is black 
hicks said he was fired because of his race even though he had 
more seniority than chester 
the shoe company asked the high court to overturn rulings in 
favor of hicks who was awarded 10000 in punitive damages and 
nearly 21000 more in attorney fees 
the supreme court in a highly publicized ruling in 1989 on the 
civil warera law left unanswered whether the act specifically 
applies to racially biased firings 
the law at issue was enacted in 1866 and provides that all 
persons shall have the same rightto make and enforce 
contracts and to the full and equal benefit of all laws 
enjoyed by white citizens 
the 1964 civil rights law offers similar protection but the 
older statute authorizes broader remedies particularly punitive 
damages 
in another civil rights case monday the court refused to 
postpone a jan 22 election under a redistricting plan designed to 
help elect a hispanic to the los angeles county board of 
supervisors for the first time in 115 years 
the court rejected an emergency request by board members who 
said the plan ordered by a federal judge is unlawful 
but the justices took no action on a formal appeal by board 
members still pending before the high court 
the fivemember board was accused by hispanics in 1988 of 
violating their rights by drawing districts after the 1980 census 
that allegedly diluted hispanic voting strength 
us district judge david v kenyon declared the former district 
plan unconstitutional and carved out a new district in which 
hispanics account for an estimated 51 percent of the registered 
voters and 71 percent of the population 
the bush administration sided with hispanic rights groups in 
urging the supreme court not to disturb kenyons ruling which was 
upheld last month by the 9th us circuit court of appeals

presidentelect lech walesa returned to 
his old shipyard monday and appealed for help in building a new 
government prosecutors said his defeated challenger must remain in 
poland to answer slander charges 
walesa spent the day wrapping up solidarity duties one day 
after his landslide victory over businessman stanislaw tyminski in 
polands first popular presidential election 
union leaders began selecting a new chairman they also began 
preparing for free spring parliamentary elections when solidarity 
may form a political wing and planning for the expected exodus of 
activists to the government in warsaw 
i have to think as the president said walesa touring 
offices in the baltic seaside town of sopot where he will work 
when not at belweder palace in warsaw 
challenger stanislaw tyminski apparently conceding defeat sent 
walesa a twosentence telegram wishing him success 
i hope you will not make a lot of mistakes and you can create 
conditions for normal life in a strong independent poland he 
said 
walesa will be sworn in to a fiveyear term as president about 
dec 21 barring protests of the vote parliament speaker mikolaj 
kozakiewicz said 
walesa received 7425 percent of the vote to tyminskis 2575 
percent according to national election commission results 
about 142 million people voted turnout was put at 53 percent 
compared with 60 percent during the first round of voting nov 25 
walesa took time for two emotional tributes he visited the 
department where he fixed electric carts when the gdansk shipyard 
was still named for lenin on tuesday he was to travel like 
polands kings to pay homage before the black madonna icon at 
jasna gora monastery in czestochowa polands holiest shrine 
at the shipyard where he led his first strike almost exactly 20 
years ago during december 1970 food riots the 47yearold walesa 
asked his old foreman and coworkers to be my support 
i am going to return here often and i am going to do 
everything for you he told workers i know where i have this 
white shirt from and i know that my overalls here were the same as 
yours sometimes even dirtier 
walesa carried every province according to unofficial results 
tyminski did best in rural areas where farmers are discontented 
with economic reforms that nolonger guarantee a minimum price for 
their products but have not dismantled the purchasing monopolies 
there are many people in poland for whom it is really bad 
walesa said we must make poland such that those doubters 
quickly join us 
walesa is under pressure to chart quickly policies that will 
continue polands painful course toward a market economy while 
answering the dissatisfaction of tyminskis sizable minority he 
has promised by wednesday to pick among the candidates he is 
considering for prime minister 
tyminski suggested sunday night he might challenge the returns 
but election officials reported no contact with him he vowed to 
remain active in polish politics 
even if there are difficulties i am now the second person in 
poland that is our victory he said 
a local prosecutor in southern poland lodged the slander case 
against tyminski after he accused prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
of treason by creating economic chaos tyminski defeated mazowiecki 
in the first round of presidential voting 
walesa said tyminski ought to account for unsubstantiated 
allegations but added that for now it is a government matter 
a dec 7 order summoned tyminski for questioning before the 
prosecutor in nowy sacz and the general prosecutor in warsaw 
confirmed to the pap news agency that steps were taken ensuring 
tyminskis presence in the country until the hearing 
after questioning it will be determined if tyminski must stay 
in poland until a verdict on the slander case the ministry said 
pap quoted sources as saying tyminski and his wife whose 
children are in toronto had booked airline tickets wednesday to 
canada tyminski has canadian peruvian and polish citizenships 
meanwhile soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was among the 
first to wish walesa success history and life prove convincingly 
the need to develop cooperation and interaction between our states 
and peoples tass said 
among others congratulating him were president bush outgoing 
president wojciech jaruzelski who interned walesa after declaring 
martial law nine years ago thursday and mazowiecki who resigned 
after his defeat

andy garcia a hispanic heartthrob 
theres nothing that i cherish more than my culture and what i 
am garcia says in januarys glamour magazine but to call me 
the great hispanic actor is ridiculous its racism they dont 
call dustin hoffman the great jewishamerican actor 
garcias family fled cuba for miami in 1961 when he was 5 
garcia 34 who plays vincent mancini the illegitimate son of 
sonny corleone in the latest godfather movie says his cuban 
heritage is the source of my strength but it also caused him 
to get boxed into latino roles during his 13year career which 
included parts in the untouchables internal affairs and 
black rain 
though his fame is increasing garcias ego apparently is not 
told he looks handsome in the tuxedo he wears in the movie 
garcia bowed his head and told the interviewer vincent thanks 
you told the interviewer also was fond of his glorious 
chest the actor replied 
i cant take responsibility for the chest its a genetic

premier li peng said monday the communist party 
central committee is finally ready to decide on the economic 
strategy that will guide china into the 21st century 
i believe the time for convening that meeting is now 
completely ripe and i am sure that we can achieve the expected 
results li said at the airport before leaving on a 10day tour 
of southeast asia 
he will visit laos becoming the first chinese premier to do so 
as well as the philippines sri lanka and the first stop malaysia 
the 175member party central committee generally meets in the 
early autumn it was expected to do so this year to approve new 
five and tenyear plans for the economy to take effect on jan 1 
when the old plans expire 
but intense backstage wrangling over the pace of economic reform 
and development priorities has stalled the drafting of plans 
li said the central committee will meet at the end of december 
but did not give a specific date he said the economic plans will 
be the only agenda item dispelling rumors that several ministerial 
changes also will be discussed 
the act of convening a central committee meeting indicates that 
some basic agreement on economic policy has been reached the 
chinese traditionally try to avoid open debate at such meetings and 
keep arguments to informal settings 
officials have been arguing about a host of issues including 
how much control the central government should have over the 
economy how much revenue provinces should give the center and 
whether stateset prices should be raised or freed from control 
the economic arguments cloak a struggle over ideology and power 
chinas power broker of the past decade senior leader deng 
xiaoping has lost prestige since endorsing the army attack on 
prodemocracy demonstrators last year and his public appearances 
and statements are rarer than ever 
li asked at the airport if deng still has final say over 
important matters answered ambiguously 
we have successfully established a new generation of 
leadership with comrade jiang zemin as the nucleus he said 
referring to the party general secretary 
this new leadership is entirely capaable of being responsible 
for all affairs within china naturally the thinking and writings 
of comrade deng xiaoping still have a positive influence on us 
and are still useful to us 
he added that deng 86 is in good health unofficial reports 
say deng has suffered from cancer for several years and rumors 
have circulated recently that his health has become much worse he 
has not been seen in public since july and has turned down requests 
for meetings by several prominent foreign visitors 
li also was asked if foreign observers will be allowed to attend 
trials of prominent activists jailed since last years crushed 
democracy movement the premier said only that the cases would be 
handled according to legal procedures and that government 
policy was very lenient 
about a dozen leading participants in the democracy movement 
were formally charged or had court hearings in the past month 
trial dates have not been announced trials in china are not open 
to the general public and foreigners are rarely allowed to attend

the food and drug administration today 
approved the first major new contraceptive in three decades an 
implant that protects women against pregnancy for up to five years 
the device called norplant consists of six matchsticksized 
silicone rubber capsules containing a hormone that is released 
slowly over time 
the capsules are implanted in the upper arm of a woman in a 
minor surgical procedure that requires only local anesthesia 
fertility is restored when the capsules are removed 
the device is more than 99 percent effective meaning that for 
every 100 women who use it at most one will become pregnant says 
the new yorkbased population council which developed norplant 
it will be marketed by wyethayerst laboratories of 
philadelphia 
the device has been approved in 16 countries where half a 
million women have used it according to the council 
many family planning experts consider norplant to be the biggest 
advance in birth control since oral contraceptives and the 
intrauterine device or iud were approved in the early 1960s 
norplant contains nothing new the hormone a synthetic 
progestin has been used safely for years council officials say 
wyethayerst has not released price information for the product

pakistan completed a nationwide 
census on monday and analysts say the new rightwing government 
has little time to find a way to cope with the nations soaring 
birthrate 
conservative estimates put pakistans current population at 
about 120 million almost 40 million more than in 1980 
at that rate family planning experts say the population will 
double by the year 2020 
this was the first census in a decade in pakistan one of the 
worlds fastestgrowing countries census takers had been going 
from tents to driedmud houses to palatial mansions since nov 22 
by the time the results are released in about six months 
hundreds of thousands of children will have been born the 
burgeoning population threatens to devour the countrys already 
meager resources 
pakistan a predominantly moslem nation produces a child every 
eight seconds observers say that kind of growth could lead to 
economic collapse 
if they dont deal with this soon theyll be facing a 
disaster in five to 10 years its a nightmare that nobody wants 
said one western diplomat who asked not to be identified 
pakistans birthrate stands at 32 percent well ahead of the 2 
percent in india its neighbor to the east so far there is little 
evidence the new government is eager to embark on an ambitious 
family planning program 
the social services ministry responsible for encouraging small 
families in pakistan is headed by a fundamentalist moslem saddar 
niazi who boasts of being one of 15 children 
he said the pressure for family planning is a holdover from the 
liberal secularism of former prime minister benazir bhutto who was 
ousted aug 6 on charges of corruption and ineffectiveness and 
overwhelmingly defeated in national elections three months later 
most pakistani women have an average of six to seven children 
the highest fertility rate in asia and only 11 percent of couples 
of childbearing age use contraceptives 
most rural women are veiled at puberty and bartered into 
marriage as early as 15 most women have at least four living 
children by the time they turn 30 almost as many would have died 
at childbirth or before the age of five 
proponents of family planning struggle against conservative 
views of islamic clerics when women consider birth control they 
are often chastised for defying what is called gods grand design 
the national institute of population studies has warned that 
even if pakistan became a nation of twochild families the 
population would grow to 160 million in the next several decades 
just to keep the current standard of living we must double 
all our infrastructure hospitals schools housing food 
production water resources and factories said spokesman 
mohammad sheikh 
pakistans infrastructure is dilapidated health care is 
inadequate and available only in the cities and towns 
khurshed ahmed a senator and member of the ultraorthodox 
jamaatiislami or party of god said there was no need for family 
planning education and affluence would check population growth he 
said 
but pakistan is desperately short of schools 
more than 52 percent of pakistans budget is spent on defense 
and a meager 4 percent on education less than 17 percent of the 
population as a whole can read or write and the percentage is far 
smaller for women

a former customs commissioner testified in 
defense of sen dennis deconcini today telling the senate ethics 
committee that intervention with government agencies is proper and 
not limited by ethical standards 
whatever approach a senator took so long as it was not 
unlawful was acceptable to me said william von raab 
commissioner of the us customs service during the reagan 
administration 
but von raab also acknowledged he had never faced pressure from 
senators under the same circumstances deconcini and other senators 
are accused of applying 
there were massive interventions by members of congress 
seeking changes in regulations or waivers for specific constituents 
when he was in office he said 
it was standard operating procedure von raab a republican 
told deconcinis lawyer james hamilton 
von raab testified during the 15th day of the ethic panels 
hearings into allegations that deconcini dariz and four other 
senators improperly intervened with sampl regulators on behalf of 
charles h keating jr who contributed 13 million to their 
campaigns and favored causes 
von raab said that not only was it common for members of 
congress to meet privately with regulators on behalf of 
constituents it also was common for them to do so even when 
regulators had referred the case to the justice department for 
criminal investigation 
but under crossexamination by the committees special counsel 
robert s bennett he said he had no direct knowledge of the 
senators efforts for keating and that he hadnt faced the same 
kind of intervention the senators are accused of applying 
deconcini faces accusations by witnesses that he tried to 
negotiate a deal on behalf of keatings lincoln savings and loan 
and continued to press regulators after being told of potential 
criminal activity at the thrift 
von raab said he sometimes refused to make changes deconcini 
wanted and in one case deconcinis position was upheld in the 
courts 
sen deconcini was always firm resolute but always fair 
he said 
later a former tax accountant for keatings company american 
continental corp testified about flights sen john mccain 
rariz and his family took on the companys aircraft 
david stevens estimated the value of the flights by mccain his 
wife cindy their child and a babysitter going back to 1984 at 
1687046 mccain repaid two of the flights at the time and more 
in 1989 when the internal revenue service examined the companys 
books 
stevens said in a letter to the committee that he never saw 
any evidence that he mccain originally inended to reimburse for 
the costs of his wife and babysitter but he said under 
questioning he did not know mccains intent and regretted the 
conclusions in his letter 
stevens said that after he wrote offering his testimony 
deconcini called to request he sign an affidavit in their call he 
said deconcini complained that mccain had received more favorable 
treatment than he had from ethics investigator and wanted stevens 
testimony to show that only a onesided case had been presented 
other witnesses testified in deconcinis defense describing 
help he provided for law enforcement drugtreatment projects and 
disabled veterans they said he acted without regard to campaign 
contributions 
i could not imagine how he could have done anything more 
said rod mullin who runs an assistance program for the poor 
evidence presented so far has been particularly damaging for the 
two senators seen as in the worst trouble democrats alan cranston 
of california and deconcini 
none of the senators could have liked the description that 
witness william k black offered last week of their april 1987 
meeting with federal regulators the senators were told of lincoln 
sampls reckless and potentially criminal practices 
this is an institution that is probably the worst institution 
in america black recounted and instead of trying to help 
bring it under control five us senators were pushing us in the 
opposite direction it was startlingly the wrong direction 
the other three senators are democrats john glenn of ohio and 
donald riegle of michigan and republican john mccain of arizona 
all sides are awaiting the testimony of james grogan a former 
top aide and lobbyist for keating he has been given limited 
immunity from prosecution for his testimony which will be given in 
private dec 17 and in public later 
federal regulators and even one of deconcinis own aides have 
described him as pressing on to help his friend and contributor 
keating despite strong warnings 
laurie a sedlmayr deconcinis aide on banking issues 
testified she didnt like keating and warned her boss that it would 
be a political mistake to go to a critical april 2 1987 
meeting on lincoln that four of the senators held with top 
regulator edwin j gray 
deconcini thanked me for my suggestion and said he was going 
to go ahead anyway she said 
gray the former reagan administration thrift regulator 
repeated his allegations that deconcini offered a deal in that 
april 2 meeting the meeting itself was improper he said because 
he felt pressured by the senators on behalf of one institution 
michael patriarca and black both san franciscobased 
regulators described deconcini as offering a deal on lincoln and 
said none of the other senators dissented or distanced themselves 
from the offer 
black contended that pressure from the senators led to the 
federal home loan bank boards may 1988 decision to ease off new 
regulatory controls proposed for lincoln 
the bank board revised its hardline policy after cranston aide 
carolyn jordan called to express displeasure her call had been set 
in motion by a call from grogan keatings lobbyist complaining 
about the bank boards action 
the result of the boards change was that the eventual takeover 
of lincoln was delayed and the cost of the taxpayers bailout of 
insured deposits was increased black said and he said it meant 
lincoln was able to sell more uninsured junk bonds to people many 
of them elderly who became victims of lincolns collapse 
keating faces fraud charges in california stemming from the sale 
of those junk bonds

president vaclav havel appealed to 
parliament on monday for new powers to keep czechoslovakia from 
splitting in two as it wrestles with vestiges of communist rule 
the former dissident and playwright who became president in 
czechoslovakias revolution last year has preferred to govern with 
moral authority 
but he said he was forced to act because a dispute over division 
of powers between the federal government and the czech and slovak 
republics threatens the countrys future 
i am very sorry i had to go this far havel said in an 
emergency speech broadcast live on national tv i am doing this 
to fulfill the expectations of millions of citizens who 
entrusted this position to me and believe i will help save our 
federation 
slovak leaders are said to be ready to declare the sovereignty 
of their laws on slovak territory unless the federal parliament 
approves a division of powers that they find acceptable 
the state news agency ctk quoted deputy premier pavel rychetsky 
as saying havel should be given power to ask for a nonpartisan 
government of experts in times of crisis to rule by decree if 
parliament has been dissolved and to veto legislation 
havel currently has the power to sign treaties command the 
armed forces appoint the federal government summon and dissolve 
parliament sign its laws grant amnesties or other legal pardons 
and declare war 
his extraordinary powers if granted would be in effect until a 
new constitution is approved that is to take place in the next 18 
months 
initial slovak reaction to havels speech ranged from no comment 
from top leaders to criticism from christian democrats one of 
three members of the governing coalition in slovakia 
i disagree with strengthening the presidential position to 
delegate lawmaking powers to the president said jan petrik the 
executive secretary of the christian democratic movement 
i cannot agree with the concentration of uncontrollable power 
in the hands of the president petrik said in the slovak capital 
bratislava 
the ctk news agency quoted slovak deputy anton andras as saying 
i consider the proposal to give broader powers to the president 
unfortunate and unsuitable we have had this before 
andras until recently slovak interior minister was alluding to 
the authoritarian communist rule 
czechoslovakia formally became a federation in 1968 but 
hardline communist rule meant slovaks felt controlled by prague 
the czech and federal capital czechs meanwhile resented the 
allocation of half the countrys resources to just one third of its 
people the approximately 5 million slovaks 
czechoslovakia is embarking on an ambitious reform program in 
which the stateowned economy will be turned over to private hands 
but western leaders repeatedly have warned that political 
instability will hamper the foreign investment and aid that the 
economy badly needs 
a law dividing powers among the federal government and the two 
republics was to be debated by parliament on tuesday when havel 
was scheduled to leave on a visit to spain and portugal 
the bill on presidential powers was to be debated later that 
leaves the issue of strong new presidential powers hanging over 
deputies while they discuss dividing government functions 
the czech and slovak parliaments differ over control of oil and 
gas pipelines taxation and budget questions postal services 
control over policy toward ethnic minorities and chairmanship of 
the national bank 
an agreement forged last month between the czech slovak and 
federal governments keeps foreign policy defense general economic 
and monetary policy under federal control 
to prolonged applause from parliament havel stressed that 
sovereignty of slovak law on slovak territory would be 
unconstitutional the federal parliaments decisions should be 
binding on all institutions and on all people he said 
otherwise the thin ice of our constitution will be broken and 
our state would inevitably fall into legal chaos he said

the postal service should rescind a decision 
to reduce delivery standards for some mail a report prepared for 
congress said monday 
the post office cut back some overnight delivery areas in july 
saying the changes would save money and improve efficiency the 
agency said the changes would slow delivery of only about 5 percent 
of firstclass mail 
the change could slow delivery of as many as 43 billion pieces 
of mail over a year according to the general accounting office 
report just say slow 
in 1989 the post office carried 858 billion pieces of 
firstclass mail five percent of that would be 43 billion 
the report charged that the postal service implemented the 
change without demonstrating that it would lead to any improvement 
for the public 
our investigation indicates that many customers especially 
those in rural america will suffer because of the new 
standards rep bob wise dw va said in a statement 
wise is chairman of the government information subcommittee of 
the house government operations committee which released the 
report 
the independent postal rate commission has also criticized the 
change in delivery standards 
the changes primarily affect areas where mail standards had 
called for overnight or secondday delivery but the post office 
had performed poorly in meeting those goals 
in general for example a pair of cities with relatively low 
volume might have been shifted from overnight to secondday 
delivery or from second to thirdday delivery in the change 
postal officials had no immediate response to the report

nelson mandela has accepted an 
invitation to join political business and church leaders on a tour 
of violenceplagued black townships the african national congress 
said monday 
there was no word on whether rival inkatha leader mangosuthu 
buthelezi would take part in wednesdays tour organized by the 
antiapartheid south african council of churches buthelezi said 
sunday he had not received an invitation 
police said 27 people died in violence throughout the country 
over the weekend and on monday including 13 in the tokoza township 
south of johannesburg wednesdays tour would include a stop in 
tokoza 
two inkatha supporters were shot to death and eight seriously 
wounded early monday when a taxi they were riding in was ambushed 
by gunfire in eastern natal province the independent south african 
press association reported 
the report said the unidentified attackers used ak47 assault 
rifles 
an inkatha official on monday accused police of instigating 
attacks on inkatha members in tokoza over the weekend there was no 
immediate government response but police and the government have 
repeatedly denied similar charges by the anc 
mandela and president fw de klerk announced sunday they had 
held secret meetings in the last week to discuss the violence the 
brief joint statement said progress had been made and further talks 
would be held but it provided no details of other steps to be 
taken 
supporters of the zuludominated inkatha freedom party have been 
fighting xhosas and other blacks loyal to the anc for five years in 
natal leaving more than 5000 people dead 
the virtual warfare spread to townships near johannesburg in 
august killing about 1000 people 
both mandela and buthelezi have called for the violence to end 
but their supporters have continued fighting 
buthelezi has called for a oneonone meeting with mandela 
saying they are the only leaders with the power to halt the 
violence 
but the anc has rejected the idea it blames buthelezi for 
instigating the violence in a bid to gain legitimacy outside of 
natal the traditional zulu homeland 
mandela attended a summit of black leaders convened last month 
by anglican archbishop desmond tutu but buthelezi turned down the 
invitation he said such a meeting would waste time unless the anc 
and inkatha first cleared up their differences 
a meeting between the leadership of the two black opposition 
groups including mandela and buthelezi also had been planned but 
was postponed indefinitely the anc said scheduling problems caused 
the postponement 
on sunday an inkatha congress called for the anc to work with 
other antiapartheid groups in seeking an end to violence and a 
quick start of negotiations with the whiteled government on ending 
apartheid 
de klerk has pledged to end apartheid and negotiate a new 
constitution with all parties that would give political power to 
the black majority 
the anc and the government have held peace talks since may on 
setting up the fullscale negotiations expected to begin next 
year but the violence has strained relations between them with 
the anc repeatedly accusing security forces of fueling the violence 
and siding with inkatha 
an official of the militant pan africanist congress said monday 
his group and the anc would meet soon to discuss forming a unified 
front to fight apartheid 
but the pac on sunday rejected an invitation to join the planned 
negotiations with the government on a new constitution saying only 
a freely elected constituent assembly had the power to draft a 
constitution

rep stephen solarz on monday announced the 
formation of a diverse group of government academic and labor 
leaders that will seek to push president bush to take a harder line 
in the persian gulf crisis 
the liberal new york democrat who has acknowledged worries that 
his party may suffer longterm political damage if it is seen as 
being too soft on iraq said he hoped to counter congressional 
critics who say bush seems too eager to use military force against 
saddam hussein 
the group the committee for peace and security in the gulf 
issued a statement endorsing the threat of military force as an 
essential part of a strategy that also includes economic sanctions 
and diplomatic isolation 
it also sought to focus attention on saddams arsenal of 
conventional chemical and biological weapons and on his efforts 
to build a nuclear bomb 
in addition to forcing iraq to withdraw from kuwait we 
believe that we must also find ways to remove saddam husseins 
capacity to wage aggression the group said the threat requires 
that iraqs weapons of mass destruction be verifiably dismantled 
or if necessary destroyed it said 
a solarz spokesman bob hathaway said while the administration 
has spoken vaguely of a need for security in the region once 
the immediate crisis is resolved the committee thinks its 
necessary for the administration to go further by directly 
confronting this issue 
the committee hopes to take out newspaper ads and hold seminars 
in washington and around the country on topics like military 
options in the gulf and the usefulness of economic sanctions it 
also hopes to sponsor speaking tours for group members 
the group includes figures as diverse as former democratic party 
political director ann lewis and reagan administration pentagon 
official richard perle its two codirectors in addition to 
solarz the group includes senators richard lugar rind and john 
mccain rariz and reps tom lantos dcalif dave mccurdy 
dokla john murtha dpa and robert torricelli dnj 
its a tribute to saddam husseins power to bring people 
together joked perle who said solarz began forming the group 
about six weeks ago 
we were concerned about where things were headed said 
perle who now is a scholar at the american enterprise institute a 
conservative think tank

a declaration providing a facesaving 
superpower exit from the afghanistan conflict has been drafted by 
us and soviet officials and could be released this week 
diplomatic sources said monday 
the threepoint document is deliberately vague and would let the 
afghans decide how to settle the 12yearold war said the sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the declaration falls far short of bringing an end to the 
conflict they said but pressure has been increasing for both 
sides to clear afghanistan from the superpower agenda before the 
jan 15 deadline for iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
the document could be released during the current talks between 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze in houston the sources said 
washingtons special envoy to the afghan resistance peter 
tomsen was expected in pakistan on tuesday he was prepared to 
explain any superpower announcement to the afghan guerrillas who 
have been trying since 1978 to overthrow the sovietsupported 
government in kabul the sources said 
we anticipate an announcement one diplomat said speaking 
on condition of anonymity its been in the cards for some time 
it may or may not happen this time were poised but it could be 
another false alarm 
the announcement had been expected during last months 
bakershevardnadze talks in geneva but was delayed by differences 
over how to cut off weapons to both warring sides they said 
the soviet union sent about 115000 troops into afghanistan in 
december 1979 to prop up successive communist governments trying to 
impose radical reforms on the largely rural moslem population 
after the red armys pullout in february 1989 moscow continued 
to pour an estimated 2 billion to 3 billion annually in weapons 
and supplies to support troops loyal to president najibullah 
western diplomats and guerrilla leaders once confidently 
measured the survival of najibullahs government in weeks and 
months but the guerrillas were unable to switch from their 
hitandrun tactics to conventional warfare and were rendered 
helpless against the wellequipped and welltrained afghan air 
force 
within months of the soviet withdrawal the anticipated 
guerrilla victory became a costly military stalemate that failed to 
produce a clear victory for either side 
with the guerrillas controlling the countryside and najibullahs 
troops holding the cities the superpowers began searching for 
diplomatic formulas to extricate themselves from a war that has 
left more than 15 million people dead and sent nearly 6 million 
afghans into exile in pakistan and iran 
diplomatic sources say the draft declaration is purposely vague 
and advocates no concrete peace plan for the afghans fiercely 
independent tribal people who throughout history have resisted 
often violently the tutelage of outsiders

when the social club run by hardboiled reputed 
mobster venero benny eggs mangano was evicted the mobs 
cobblers resisted any urge to fit the landlord for concrete shoes 
instead the greenwich village neighborhood was covered with 
posters banners and petitions in an unsuccessful campaign to 
keep the club 
nonviolence failed to sway landlord martin herzog a brave and 
thrifty soul who claims an art gallery or boutique will pay 3500 
a month for the storefront that mangano rented for 250 
ive known benny eggs and the rest of those guys for 25 
years herzog said im not afraid of them im only afraid of 
god 
law enforcers describe mangano a short bald 69yearold as 
no 2 man in the genovese crime family the nations second 
largest 
the nameless club at 101 thompson st was frequented by old men 
from the neighborhood who would chat play cards or sip a drink at 
the tables inside when the weather was warm theyd hang out on 
the sidewalk no one claims all or even most of them were 
criminals and their presence comforted residents worried about 
street crime 
benny eggs also met business associates at the club but in 
recent years he had done most of his talking while strolling around 
the block said a federal prosecutor who spoke on condition he not 
be identified 
before the eviction posters appeared around the neighborhood 
so far we have been able to keep hard drugs off the street when 
we move the drug dealers and criminals will know they warned 
keep the club proclaimed a banner unfurled from a fire escape 
on the front of the building 
several young occupants of the apartments above the club people 
who did not grow up in the neighborhood but valued the club as a 
hedge against crime carried petitions door to door and collected 
hundreds of signatures 
after the eviction took effect the end of october a new set of 
posters appeared mr herzog promised we could stay as long as he 
controlled the building now hes evicted us call his lawyer and 
tell him you will not patronize any new business here 
herzog says that when he purchased the building four years ago 
he shook hands with mangano and told him to expect a rent increase 
he says he began eviction proceedings when mangano refused to pay 
more 
for benny eggs the struggle over the club became academic 
he was arrested earlier this year with seven codefendants on 
charges of conspiring to rig bids on city window replacement 
contracts pending his trial he is confined to his home with an 
electronic monitor to verify his presence 
initially mangano was allowed to spend weekends at the 
seashore but a judge revoked that privilege after his accusers 
wife found a bomb in the front seat of her car 
tony dapolito whose family has run an italian bakery in the 
neighborhood of the club for 70 years says many lawabiding 
citizens were sad to see it go 
people felt they threw those poor old men out he said 
with the club they had a place to go the nearest senior center 
is 10 blocks away and the k of c knights of columbus is five 
blocks 
these clubs used to be all over the city and theyre what 
made the streets safe he added im not condoning all of them 
but most of them were pretty decent places 
herzog does not share his nostalgia this areas been a slum 
long enough he said he called benny eggs and company 
parasites and asked why dont they go play pinochle in 
their rentcontrolled apartments

the head of the federal agency that has loaned 
billions of dollars to americas rural electric cooperatives 
acknowledged monday that some of the borrowers are having trouble 
repaying their lowinterest loans 
gary c byrne who has headed the rural electrification 
administration since march also said the agencys lending program 
must be tightened to make it more responsible 
we have some difficult credit situations byrne told a small 
group of reporters in his first meeting with the press however he 
added im reasonably confident that were through the worst of 
the credit problems 
eight rural electric cooperatives currently are in default on 
23 billion in loans from the rea four of the eight are in 
chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization the eight also owe 125 
billion to private creditors 
only a few of the nations nearly 1000 electric coops are in 
serious trouble but the money problems have made some experts 
fearful of the reas financial health nearly all the coops 
nationwide have received lowinterest federal loans or federal 
guarantees for bank loans 
the financial troubles gripping some electric coops and their 
potential impact on the federal loan program were disclosed in an 
article by the associated press 
byrne the first banker to be appointed rea administrator said 
the outlook for coops will depend on the health of the economy and 
on the weather if the economy is weak or the weather is warmer 
than usual this winter he said demand for electricity and 
consequently the coops revenue would decrease 
byrne said the rea has adopted a strategy that includes steering 
financially healthy coops toward the private market for their 
loans and weaning them away from federal aid the agency plans to 
reduce the number of lowinterest loans it grants and replace them 
with loan guarantees 
in addition he said the rea needs to revise its lending 
policies to better distinguish between the coops with the greatest 
financial need and those less in need of federal funds 
the new approach does assure the american taxpayers that if 
the money is loaned out that money will be returned byrne said 
the rural electrification program set up in the mid1930s 
radically changed us agriculture by providing the cheap electric 
power that enabled farmers to modernize but critics complain that 
the program no longer serves a useful purpose and is a waste of 
taxpayers money 
the bush administration looking for ways to reduce the swelling 
federal budget deficit has mounted a quiet attack on the rea 
subsidies the office of management and budget in a recent memo to 
the energy department proposed phasing out all rea subsidies over 
ten years 
i think were going to be battling for funds over the next 
several years byrne said you keep the program strong by 
making the program financially responsible 
the biggest losses have been posted by big cooperatives that 
generate their own electricity most of the smaller coops which 
are members of the generating coops and only distribute 
electricity are in sound financial shape 
the rea has proposed new administrative rules that would among 
other things require the smaller distribution coops to guarantee 
loans made to their parent cooperatives 
byrne who was appointed by president bush to a 10year term 
formerly was chairman of the bank of alex brown in sacramento 
calif prior to his appointment rea administrators had come from a 
farming or ranching background

president mikhail gorbachev told communist party 
leaders monday they have nothing to fear from his union treaty 
proposal to drop the word socialist from the countrys name and 
replace it with sovereign 
the treaty plan contains strong expressions of the ideas and 
principles we connect with socialism its humanistic democratic 
nature gorbachev assured the partys embattled central committee 
during a closeddoor session 
gorbachev who is also head of the the communist party urged 
party leaders to create a strong political desire for the 
preservation and renewal of the union 
what is profitable for separatists is absolutely fatal for the 
majority of workers gorbachev said the party meeting was closed 
to journalists and a text of his speech was carried later by the 
state news agency tass 
several of the 15 republics already have dropped soviet 
socialist from their names as a rejection of decades of soviet 
communism 
last week hardline members of the national legislature 
demanded gorbachev suspend steps toward democratic reforms as a way 
to hold the union together they suggested gorbachev be replaced if 
he does not take action 
some european leaders also have expressed fears that civil 
strife could send millions of soviets fleeing across international 
borders 
gorbachevs draft treaty which would replace a 1922 document 
envisions changing the countrys name from union of soviet 
socialist republics to union of sovereign soviet republics 
gorbachev said his proposal is a government document not the 
statement of a political party 
will there be a union of strong sovereign states or a 
crumbling symbolic formation gorbachev asked the policymaking 
central committee leaders of the 17 millionmember party that has 
been steadily losing members and authority 
the draft treaty never mentions the words socialism or 
communism it divides powers between the central government and 
the republics and says economic development strategy will be 
determined jointly 
it would give more economic power to the republics while 
retaining kremlin control over the military foreign policy 
transportation energy and other key industries 
six republics already have said they will not sign and demanded 
kremlin endorsement of their sovereignty declarations 
all the soviet republics except kirgizia in central asia have 
declared some form of autonomy or independence lawmakers in 
kirgizia had sovereignty on their agenda as they opened a session 
monday 
kirgizias legislative speaker absamat masaliev resigned 
monday in order to concentrate on duties as a communist party 
official tass reported it was unclear whether masalievs 
resignation was connected to the republics sovereignty debate 
in moscow gorbachev also blasted the war of laws in which 
national and republic lawmakers have passed conflicting 
legislation paralyzing the economy he has said the treaty is 
needed to stave off economic collapse 
if patches of land divided by customs barriers independent 
currencies or even border guards form in place of an allunion 
market vast opportunities will be lost he said 
gorbachev reiterated his insistence that no republic can secede 
without a referendum 
gorbachev also rejected proposals to adopt new constitutions in 
each republic before signing the union treaty he said 
interrepublic agreements are acceptable only if they do not 
supplant the union treaty nearly a dozen such bilateral treaties 
have been signed 
earlier monday tass said rumors that gorbachev will step down 
as communist party chief are totally unfounded such rumors 
have been circulating for a year

the reputed chief of organized crime in 
new england claims the first amendment right of free speech and 
association should bar the government from using tapes of a 
purported mafia induction ceremony 
raymond j junior patriarca does not admit that the mafia or 
la cosa nostra exists but if it does he argues a secret 
induction ceremony is clearly protected by the first 
amendment from governmental intrusion 
patriarca 46 of lincoln outlined his defense in pretrial 
motions filed last week in us district court in boston the 
providence journalbulletin reported monday 
he noted that the amendment applies to the ku klux klan and the 
nazi party which are far more heinous yet unquestionably 
protected organizations 
he is trying to block introduction of six hours of tape 
recordings that agents made of a meeting on oct 29 1989 at a 
house in medford mass the government alleges that at the meeting 
four new members took a blood oath to kill anyone who violated the 
organizations secrecy 
patriarca has been in prison since his march indictment on 
charges of racketeering conspiracy and interstate travel in aid of 
racketeering he is accused of organized crime violations along 
with 21 other alleged members and associates of the purported 
patriarca crime family in massachusetts connecticut and rhode 
island 
until patriarca submitted numerous court motions last week 
seeking to quash the charges and the evidence there had been 
speculation he was trying to work out a plea agreement 
he also challenged the warrant that allowed the bugging of the 
meeting and says the tapes should not be used against him because 
the government didnt mention him as a target of the bugging in the 
warrant 
floyd abrams a noted first amendment attorney from new york 
said patriarcas argument is not without its charm but he said 
the right of speech and association never had been allowed to 
shield criminal conduct 
it is one thing for him to argue there is no cosa nostra and 
if it exists im not in it and its another to say if it exists 
its just a private social club abrams said 
vincent blasi a professor of first amendment law at columbia 
university agreed that the constitutional protection doesnt apply 
when the government has a reasonable basis to believe that 
intercepted conversations will reveal crimes 
the government has until dec 31 to respond

a stable of playedout polo ponies 
rundown racehorses and pleasure steeds too old for fun have found 
a patch of heaven at mill creek farm where they are never ridden 
saddled or worked 
the 24 horses now living on the farm literally have been put out 
to pasture all they have to do as long as they live is to eat from 
ample supplies of forage and grain and socialize with each other 
we feel like there is a need for a place like this said 
peter gregory who operates the retirement home for horses inc 
near this community northwest of gainesville in northern florida 
many horse owners cannot or do not want to keep their horses 
after the animals get older and they end up being destroyed 
gregory said 
he and his wife mary take in horses from people and 
institutions who have heard about them from word of mouth they 
rely on voluntary contributions but pay much of the the minimum 
40amonth cost of caring for each horse themselves 
in a small way we are trying to make up for the things that 
have happened to them he said 
the gregorys took on the work in their own retirement buying 
the 140 acres of rolling pasture and woodland about seven years 
ago they formed a nonprofit corporation with taxexempt 
charitableinstitution status that they hope will enable the farm 
to take in horses for years to come

a grand jury meets this week and may 
decide whether a suspect should again face charges in the 1963 
ambush slaying of civil rights leader medgar evers 
all i can say is there is speculation the case will be 
presented the week of dec 10 myrlie evers widow of medgar 
evers said in a recent telephone interview with reporters from her 
home in los angeles she said she hoped to be in mississippi in 
case she is needed to testify 
district attorney ed peters declined to comment when asked if 
the byron de la beckwith case would be considered by the hinds 
county jury 
evers was field secretary of the mississippi naacp when he was 
shot to death june 12 1963 in the driveway of his jackson home 
authorities said a highpowered rifle bearing beckwiths 
fingerprint was found nearby beckwith at the time a greenwood 
fertilizer salesman said the weapon had been stolen 
two allwhite juries were unable to reach verdicts in february 
and april 1964 and mistrials were declared the murder charge was 
dismissed against beckwith in 1969 
beckwith 70 who now lives in signal mountain tenn remains 
an ardent segregationist but says he is innocent its amazing 
theyd wait 27 years to convene a grand jury he said last week 
assistant district attorney bobby delaughter confirmed that he 
has spent the past 14 months investigating the evers slaying 
initially the investigation centered on possible jury tampering 
after published reports that the old state sovereignty commission 
a nowdefunct segregation watchdog agency collected information 
about potential jurors in beckwiths second trial 
a different grand jury met in december 1989 but found no 
evidence of jury tampering that panel asked for more investigation 
into the prospects of reopening a murder prosecution delaughter 
said

the only thing brewing at the 
original budweiser on monday was trouble 
beer stopped flowing when the czech braumeisters went on strike 
monday in a brewhaha over merging with the makers of americas 
version of the famous fermented beverage 
budvar brewery in the southern bohemian town of ceske 
budejovice known as budweis in german has brewed its namesake 
beer since it was founded in the 19th century 
early in this century bavarianborn adolphus busch acquired the 
rights to sell budweiser in north america 
budvar maintained the trademark rights for europe with exports 
on the continent worth 8 million in 1989 
now after a failed attempt under communist rule in 1988 
attempts are under way to reunite the two budweisers 
anheuser busch tried and failed two years ago to establish a 
joint venture with budvar offering a 2 million investment 
the attempt created a wave of protest among budweis consumers 
around ceske budejovice 100 miles south of prague 
the local newspaper jihoceska pravda south bohemian truth 
quoted beer drinkers at the time as saying they would rather die 
than see an agreement with a company whose beer is a weak 
imitation of the original product 
youll never see our beer in cans we use them cans oor 
sauerkraut only an irritated young businessman reportedly said 
then 
but budvar seems ready for american investment now that 
communist rule has been overturned and the economy opened up to 
rapid privatization 
budvar is to become an independent staterun shareholding 
company in january with the finance ministry overseeing its 
gradual privatization 
once that happens budvar as the largest of statecontrolled 
breweries is the most likely candidate for an eventual merger with 
anheuserbusch 
budvars approximately 300 workers seem to favor the bud 
reunion they walked out monday to press state management into 
speeding up talks on a merger with the american company and 
guaranteeing jobs 
this strike is an extreme solution which damages the 
brewery josef tolar the brewerys acting manager told the 
state news agency ctk after the stoppage was announced 
we were left with no alternative he added 
the workers say management of state breweries in south bohemia 
is slowing talks with demands for compensation for its past 
investments in budvar 
antonin kratochvile general manager of the brewery chain known 
as jihoceske pivovary said budvar has agreed to pay his group 160 
million crowns 65 million 
he refused to comment on american participation in the deal 
saying only it was millions rather than billions of dollars other 
details of an eventual merger have not been made public nor were 
details available on how much beer budvar brews daily

the bush administration indicated monday that 
an aid package to help the soviet union get through the winter 
could be forthcoming suggesting it wants to reward moscow for help 
in the persian gulf 
officials said the aid could include emergency food and medical 
supplies as well as trade benefits 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said president bush may 
grant trade concessions even if the soviets do not pass a 
liberalized emigration law which the united states has long said 
must precede concessions 
fitzwater cited the severity of soviet economic problems and a 
desire to reward moscow for its political help in the persian gulf 
in houston secretary of state james a baker iii gave the 
clearest sign yet that the administration was prepared to help the 
soviet union with food and other supplies 
as far as humanitarian assistance medical assistance food 
and that sort of thing i know the president will be forthcoming 
with respect to trying to help baker said after soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze specifically requested food aid 
fitzwater said the president was considering waiving the 
jacksonvanik law which has imposed severe restrictions on soviet 
trade with the united states since 1974 mainly because of its 
repression of jews 
earlier this year administration efforts to liberalize trade 
with moscow were slowed by the soviet crackdown on independence 
movements in lithuania and other baltic republics 
bush met monday with lithuanian president vytautas lansbergis 
even as the united states considers aiding the soviet economy the 
kremlin is threatening lithuania with economic catastrophe 
lansbergis told reporters after the session 
he likened the plight of lithuania to iraqioccupied kuwait and 
said he appealed to bush to take an active policy if moscow 
escalates its pressure against the breakaway state 
afterwards fitzwater said bush relayed to lansbergis that there 
was no change in us support for selfdetermination for all three 
baltic republics 
the president said the united states has never recognized the 
forcible incorporation of the baltic states into the ussr and 
assured president lansbergis that this policy would not change 
fitzwater said 
lansbergis indicated heand bush did not discuss what the united 
states might do if it provided food aid to the soviet union and 
moscow in turn denied food to the rebellious republics 
under pressure from congress bush said in june at his summit 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that further trade 
liberalization including granting moscow mostfavorednation 
status would be delayed until the soviet legislature passes a law 
liberalizing emigration policies 
that law has not been passed 
we are considering going ahead with waiver of jacksonvanik 
without passage of the law said fitzwater 
asked why the spokesman said that the soviets had largely 
liberalized their emigration policies toward jews and other 
minorities 
he also cited what appears to be a very serious need in terms 
of their economy and in terms of their ability to get food 
supplies and noted their cooperation in the persian gulf their 
strong support of us in that area 
in houston shevardnadze asked specifically for food relief as 
he and baker opened two days of talks that focused on resolving the 
remaining differences on a strategic nuclear weapons treaty bush 
and gorbachev hope to sign in moscow next month 
shevardnadze posing for pictures with baker told reporters 
we would appreciate if possible some food supplies that is 
the most acute problem 
he added that the soviets would also like to receive from the 
united states efficient economic cooperation 
baker said bush is considering helping the soviets as they try 
to make a difficult transition in their economic system the 
united states would want to be of assistance in ways that we can 
be baker said 
but the jacksonvanik curbs remain the biggest obstacles to 
giving the soviet union access to us markets and banks 
the law named after the late sen henry jackson of washington 
and former rep charles vanik of ohio was enacted to try to force 
the soviets to allow jews and other minorities to emigrate under 
gorbachev jewish emigration has hit a record 
bush is weighing his options on whether to waive the 
jacksonvanik law fitzwater said indicating that a decision might 
be made by the end of the week 
white house officials said that the issue of waiving the 
jacksonvanik restrictions was separate from any emergency package 
that might be assembled 
bush will meet with shevardnadze at the white house on 
wednesday

the state department praised plans by angolas 
marxiststye ruling party to allow a multiparty system and said 
monday that elections should be called as soon as possible 
the ruling popular movement for the liberation of angola voted 
sunday to revise the constitution and allow democracy before the 
end of march 
the party known by its portuguese acronym mpla also called for 
freemarket economic reforms and recommended legislation to 
guarantee rights of expression religion and association and 
freedom of the press 
we are encouraged by the mpla party decision to move toward 
amending the constitution to allow for the creation of other 
political parties in angola said state department spokesman 
richard boucher 
a 15year civil war between the sovietbacked government and 
usaided rebels has killed 340000 people according government 
estimates cuban forces backing the government have been reduced 
from about 50000 to 10000 this year as a result of peace talks 
the government and rebels are to meet for a sixth round of peace 
talks in january in portugal 
boucher urged the government of president jose eduardo dos 
santos rapidly to permit a multiparty system in which the 
usbacked rebels and other groups would be given the right to 
form and operate as political parties 
jonas savimbi leader of the rebel national union for the total 
independence of angola known as unita said last week that he 
would agree to a ceasefire if the ruling party approved a 
multiparty system and elections 
boucher said the mpla move does not change us aid plans 
the united states has been aiding the rebels and has said it 
would not stop helping unita until the government guarantees them a 
role in a multiparty society

a former highranking state senator 
was sentenced monday to 12 years in federal prison for corruption 
uncovered in an fbi sting in which he sold influence for campaign 
contributions 
paul carpenter stood silently when us district judge edward 
garcia sentenced him declining an offer to speak 
carpenter a silverhaired 62yearold democrat from suburban 
los angeles was convicted in september of racketeering extortion 
and conspiracy the charges followed an undercover operation at the 
state capital in the sting an fbi agent posing as a businessman 
paid carpenter 20000 in campaign contributions to get a bill 
through the legislature 
at carpenters trial other instances were cited of his shaking 
down lobbyists for campaign money 
carpenter who must surrender to authorities by jan 7 was also 
ordered to repay 20000 he received from an fbi undercover agent 
in the sting operation 
its a case of proven acceptance of bribery money and 
extortion of money in the form of political contributions said 
the judge who called the evidence against carpenter 
overwhelming 
the judge also observed that the former lawmaker felt no 
remorse he said carpenters punishment was intended to deter 
others carpenter will be eligible for parole in four years 
carpenters attorney gerard hinckley said he would appeal the 
sentence 
a former senate democratic caucus chairman carpenter was for 
several years one of that bodys top fundraisers after 12 years in 
the senate he was elected in 1986 to the board of equalization 
his sentencing removes carpenter from the powerful state tax board 
carpenter was the second elected state official snagged in the 
fiveyear fbi probe joseph montoya was still a state senator when 
he was convicted in february of racketeering extortion and money 
laundering he is serving a 6year prison sentence 
the investigation is continuing so far four other people have 
pleaded guilty to charges that flowed from it two former 
legislative aides and two former county law enforcers another two 
former legislative aides are awaiting trial 
most of the charges against carpenter related to his dealings 
with john brennan an fbi agent who posed as alabama businessman 
jack gordon 
the agent paid carpenter 20000 in campaign contributions as a 
payoff for carpenters help in getting a bill through the senate to 
finance a fictitious shrimp business 
carpenter said he told an aide he wouldnt take the money unless 
he was assured that he wouldnt have to do anything in return 
however the next day in a taperecorded conversation with 
brennan carpenter promised to serve as the bills problemsolver 
and to stroke the state treasurer to remove opposition to the 
measure 
the bill was approved by the legislature but vetoed by gov 
george deukmejian who was tipped off to the fbi investigation

president violeta chamorro will veto 
any cut in her proposed defense budget rather than risk a backlash 
from the sandinistaled army a top government aide said monday 
minister of the presidency antonio lucayo said mrs chamorro 
will not allow the 786 million budget plan to be mutilated in 
such a way as to endanger that security 
mrs chamorros 1991 spending proposal allocates 16 percent of 
the 499 million national budget to the armed forces 
it is a sharp decline from defense budgets under her sandinista 
predecessors who battled usbacked contra rebels for about 10 
years but national assembly is split over the proposal and many 
deputies mrs chamorros coalition demand even bigger cuts 
the 39 sandinista deputies in the 92member assembly have said 
they approve of mrs chamorros proposal 
under mrs chamorros 8monthold government the armed forces 
has been trimmed from 100000 troops to about 28000 
the national assembly is scheduled to begin debate on the budget 
tuesday 
the military is one of the most sensitive issues confronting 
mrs chamorro who left the armed forces and police in sandinista 
hands the move assured a peaceful change of governments but 
enraged much of the conservative united national opposition 
coalition that backed her candidacy 
her uno critics say mrs chamorro is at the mercy of the 
sandinista armed forces and police 
the assembly must vote on a budget by dec 15 and send it to 
mrs chamorro by law the 1991 budget must be approved by midnight 
on dec 20

president bush on monday told lithuanias 
president he hopes the soviet union will work with the leaders of 
independenceminded baltic republics without resorting to threats 
or force 
in the first meeting between a us president and the head of 
state of tiny lithuania bush and vytautas landbergis discussed 
negotiations with moscow in pursuit of lithuanias recognition as a 
sovereign state 
while the kremlin has suspended its economic blockade of 
lithuania pending the outcome of independence talks there is 
still definitely tension in the situation said bush spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
landbergis speaking to reporters immediately after his talk 
with bush in the oval office said his republic is being attacked 
today by the kremlin through various means including threats and 
intimidation 
we are being threatened with economic catastrophe we are 
being threatened with military action against us landbergis 
said therefore the purpose of my visit today to the white house 
was to ask for some sort of political protection from the united 
states 
he said he received no firm promise from bush that the united 
states would provide such protection 
but shortly after the meeting fitzwater issued a statement 
reviewing the subjects discussed and reiterating us refusal to 
recognize the kremlins absorption of lithuania latvia and estonia 
into the soviet union a half century ago

solution to the problem between the baltic states and the ussr 
and hoped the soviet government would work constructively with

a highlevel committee said monday that nasa 
must focus on science and not on flashy futuristic projects 
both on the space shuttle and on the proposed space station if it 
is not merely to drift through the decade ahead 
the space science program ranks above space stations 
aerospace planes manned missions to the planets and many other 
major pursuits which often receive greater visibility said the 
governments advisory committee on the future of the us space 
program 
it said nasa was trying to do too much and allowing too little 
margin for the unexpected leading to frequent revamping of major 
programs the agency should concentrate on two major undertakings 
studying earths environment from space in a mission to planet 
earth and exploring space in a mission from planet earth 
the committee said the space shuttle should be flown only when 
astronaut skills are needed and that no new shuttles should be 
built after the endeavour now under construction is completed 
instead the committee recommends that a new unmanned heavylift 
launch vehicle be developed and used for all but missions requiring 
human presence 
now its our challenge said vice president dan quayle head 
of the national space council after he was briefed by the 
committee this report will give our space program a needed shot 
in the arm 
richard truly the nasa administrator said he has invited the 
committee and its chairman to meet with the agencys senior 
managers so we can deal with the recommendations in the report 
but overall he said he sees no major change in nasas pace of 
science programs 
he took issue with allowing the shuttle production line to close 
after endeavour we should not give up the ability to build one 
if for any reason we need to build another one truly said 
sen al gore dtenn chairman of the senate science 
subcommittee praised the report as a reasoned view of the space 
program and said it will form the basis of a congressional review 
in the next session 
nasa assembled the outside review at the request of the bush 
administration after a spate of embarrassments that included 
grounding of the shuttle fleet because of leaks on columbia and 
atlantis and a flaw in grinding the hubble space telescopes 
mirror 
repairs were made and columbia the leakiest of the shuttles 
was returning to earth at 1251 am est tuesday in california 
after a nineday flight atlantis flew last month 
nasa is neither as troubled as some suggest nor as good as it 
will have to be to carry out the program we have recommended 
norman augustine chairman of the 12member committee told a news 
conference but he said the agency was at a crossroads 
the committees report said a focus must be given to this 
program now if it is not merely to drift through the decade ahead 
although there is no particular timetable that can in good 
conscience be assigned to this pursuit it nonetheless sorely needs 
agreement as to direction 
augustine is chairman and chief executive officer of the martin 
marietta corporation a major rocket builder he said he did not 
participate in discussions of a new heavylift vehicle 
other members of the committee included edward c aldridge jr 
former secretary of the air force joseph p allen former 
astronaut edward p boland a former congressman whose committee 
oversaw nasa spending and thomas o paine nasa administrator 
during the apollo moon flight era 
the space agency already has moved toward a commitment to 
science projects it stopped delivering commercial satellites to 
orbit after the challenger disaster in 1986 and last month 
conducted its last secret pentagon mission although it still has 
three unclassified defense department cargoes 
the committee said the civil space program is overly dependent 
on the shuttle for access to space but said it should not be used 
for satellite deliveries which can be carried out on unmanned 
rockets 
its a mistake to risk seven people and onefourth of our 
shuttles to place a commercial communications satellite into 
space augustine said 
the committee said a subject not often mentioned is the 
statistical probability that we are likely to lose another space 
shuttle in the next several years probably before the planned 
space station is completely established on orbit 
the report did not mince words about the space station which 
had been planned for the mid90s but has run into major financing 
and other snags 
we do not believe that the space station freedom as we now 
know it can be justified solely on the basis of the nonbiological 
science it can perform the committee said instead its 
objectives should be only two primarily life sciences and 
secondarily microgravity experimentation 
we believe the space station freedom can be simplified 
reduced in cost and constructed on a more evolutionary modular 
basis that enables endtoend testing of most systems prior to 
launch the report said 
the committee sought to deflect suggestions that an agency other 
than nasa should be in charge of space activities saying nasa 
and only nasa has the knowledge and expertise to sustain the 
countrys space program

federal regulators on monday lifted an 
evacuation order imposed on a flooded subdivision after 
cancercausing pcbs were discovered in the oily floodwater 
the decision allowed residents forced from 120 homes near the 
little calumet river to return to assess flood damage and gather 
personal belongings six inches of rain late last month left the 
420home wicker park manor subdivision under five feet of water 
polychlorinated biphenyls once used as insulators in electrical 
transformers were banned by the federal government in the 1970s 
the main eastwest street through the subdivision became a 
dividing line wednesday after the environmental protection agency 
detected double the acceptable safe limit of pcbs in the 
floodwater 
residents living north of the street were banned from returning 
to their homes while other residents were granted access the 
source of the pcbs is not known 
the entire subdivision was closed friday while epa testers 
broadened the scope of their sampling to areas south of the street 
a growing number of residents were permitted to return through 
sunday as followup tests showed no detectable levels of pcbs in 
homes heating oil soil or debris said epa spokesman philip 
schuette 
the negative test results suggest the epa may have trouble 
finding the origin of the contamination he said 
frank deatley emergency coordinator for the highland town 
council said local officials accepted the epa recommendation to 
allow access to homes despite not knowing where the pcbs came from 
im sure well all feel better if we know what the source was 
likewise you have to move on when you can 
the white house has issued a disaster declaration making lake 
county flood victims eligible for lowcost federal loans for

doctors and government agencies are looking 
the other way while alcoholic women including a disproportionate 
number of indians give birth to thousands of children with 
debilitating handicaps a senate committee was told monday 
many doctors fail to confront women who drink during pregnancy 
and arent trained to diagnose and treat children afflicted with 
the resulting birth defects said parents and experts in testimony 
to the senate finance subcommittee on social security and family 
policy 
about 5000 babies are born each year with fetal alcohol 
syndrome a cause of mental retardation and 35000 more suffer 
from less severe effects of a mothers drinking according to the 
national council on alcoholism and drug dependence 
the problem is particularly acute on indian reservations where 
the rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is seven times the national 
average said sen tom daschle dsd one of every four children 
on the pine ridge reservation in south dakota is born with the 
malady daschle said 
fetal alcohol syndrome could create a continual underclass in 
our society who cant function said michael dorris a dartmouth 
university professor who adopted three children with alcoholcaused 
birth defects 
in this great land of plenty many babies are born exposed to 
such high levels of alcohol and drugs before birth that they die or 
are born intoxicated said jeaneen grey eagle director of a pine 
ridge treatment program they are doomed to spend the rest of 
their life with birth defects and or mental retardation she 
said 
doctors on the reservation shy away from diagnosing children 
with the diseases or confronting their mothers during pregnancy 
because of social stigmas grey eagle said 
she told of one baby so intoxicated at birth that she passed 
out adding that her mother who had no prenatal care was drunk 
when she arrived at the hospital 
the problem is most common among poor indians and blacks but a 
maryland woman who grew up in a upper middle class home in suburban 
washington told the committee she gave birth to a severely 
handicapped daughter and had two other babies die before seeking 
treatment for alcoholism 
i never meant to harm my children said kathleen tavenner of 
emmitsburg md it was ignorance that harmed my child 
she had been a client of several welfare programs while abusing

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze exulted monday as he sat at 
the controls of a mock us space shuttle lets take off 
alongside secretary of state james a baker iii played the role 
of copilot with a wide grin on his face 
hes the guest i feel more secure that way because i cant 
fly baker said explaining why he had yielded the controls to 
the soviet minister 
their visit to the johnson space center reflected the new warmth 
in ussoviet relations so did a pledge by baker to consider 
providing food and other humanitarian assistance to the soviets as 
they stagger at the brink of economic disintegration 
we would appreciate it shevardnadze said softly telling 
reporters that food supplies were the most acute problem facing 
his people 
baker assured him that the united states would want to be of 
assistance in ways that we can be 
baker and shevardnadze are holding two days of talks on the 
crisis in the persian gulf a stillunfinished treaty to trim us 
and soviet nuclear weapons and other tough issues 
among those issues is the lingering conflict in afghanistan 
between the sovietbacked central governeent and rebels armed by 
the united states pakistan and saudi arabia 
us and soviet sources said the two sides were close to a 
decision to suspend their weapons shipments an announcement would 
be made in a statement at the end of their meeting tuesday 
as part of the deal the bush administration would accept 
president najibullah continuing in charge in kabul during a 
transition to an elected government 
the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 and withdrew last year 
they provide the promoscow government with about 500 million in 
military aid a year 
the united states backs a coalition of rebels some of them 
ardent moslem fundamentalists with about 430 million in annual 
assistance 
putting those issues aside temporarily baker and shevardnadze 
toured the space center and spoke by telephone to the commander of 
the columbia as the shuttle prepared to return to earth 
we are extremely proud of the work you are doing baker told 
the crew 
then shevardnadze speaking in russian picked up another phone 
and told the astronauts you are paving new roads in space for 
the happiness of all of us here on earth 
astrophysicist jeffrey a hoffman replied in russian we are 
very pleased 
the united states and the soviet union have competed vigorously 
in space both for prestige and for whatever military advantage 
could be gained but the superpowers have also engaged in some 
cooperation a dozen american astronauts and soviet cosmonauts have 
been on joint missions 
all of us would like to see less military application and more 
peace missions shevardnadze said 
before baker and shevardnadze arrived at the space center a 
spirited german shepherd sniffed for explosives slipping as it 
tried to maneuver on a shiny plexiglass floor in a mock space 
cabin 
baker gave the soviet foreign minister a flag from a joint 1975 
docking mission in return shevardnadze presented baker with 
american and texas flags from an interplanetary probe 
shevardnadze said he was trying to persuade baker to have their 
next meeting in space

lawmakers in the supreme soviet voted monday to 
give investors and labor organizers more legal protection 
throughout the soviet union 
the legislation dealt mainly with the principles of a market 
economy and did not address issues of currency convertibility or 
property ownership nor the dismantling of a state bureaucracy that 
often saddles investors with red tape 
the supreme soviet approved general principles of investment 
policy that guarantees equal rights for all investors 
irrespective of property forms tass reported the act is aimed 
at forming markettype investment relations and stepping up 
entrepreneurial activities in the country 
the state news agency said investors under the new legislation 
must be reimbursed for any losses incurred by actions of state 
bodies violating their rights 
the legislature later adopted a law on trade unions that 
provides for the independence of trade unions from government 
economic and political bodies and their complete material and 
financial independence tass reported it gave few other details 
the law on labor unions comes two months after 900 soviet coal 
miners meeting in the ukraine established their own independent 
union and set up a governing structures that rejected state 
involvement 
for most of the soviet unions 73year history labor unions 
were outlawed on the theory that the ruling communist party 
embodied interests of workers as the leading party of the workers

libyas un ambassador accused america on 
monday of training libyan pows in hhad as guerrillas to undermine 
col moammar gadhafis government the red cross expressed concern 
over a us airlift of the pows 
on friday and saturday as victorious rebels consolidated their 
control of chad the united states flew out about 600 libyan 
prisoners of war held by the former chadian government to nigeria 
libyan ambassador ali treiki demanded an emergency security 
council meeting and said he would discuss scheduling one with 
council president abdalla saleh alashtal the yemeni ambassador 
on monday 
treiki said was concerned about the wellbeing of the libyans 
and about the danger of a usorganized plot against his 
government 
there is no doubt that the united states has used them they 
want to use them against our country he said 
we are worried about them the red cross has not been allowed 
to interview them 
the libyan said it is against international law and the geneva 
convention on treatment of pows to indoctrinate prisoners of 
war 
the us ambassador to chad richard bogosian has declined to 
comment on reports that us military advisers trained the captured 
soldiers for commando operations against libya 
reports on sunday said the airlifted libyans final destination 
was believed to be zaire 
the international committee of the red cross complained monday 
in a statement in geneva that it was not allowed to supervise the 
airlift and said it wanted to interview the prisoners to make sure 
they left voluntarily 
the icrc has not been able to carry out protection work on 
their behalf as it would have wished it said 
a spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
icrc was making representations to the united states and others in 
a bid to gain access to the prisoners 
she said an icrc delegate was at chads ndjamena airport but 
could not meet with prisoners privately to make sure they wanted to 
leave 
the icrc said it was never allowed to visit libyan prisoners 
captured during the long conflict between chad and libya despite 
repeated representations to chads former government led by 
president hissene habre 
idriss debys rebel forces toppled habre this month deby is now 
interim president 
treiki said monday that 17 libyan pows were slain during the 
rebel takeover of chad but that he did not know who killed them or 
under what circumstances 
libyan foreign minister ibrahim bashari said on sunday the 
evacuated libyan pows are held against their will they were 
taken hostage because they have a lot of information they were 
trained and armed to destabilize the government of their own 
country or the political system of other nations 
bashari spoke after meeting with nigerian president gen ibrahim 
babangida in efforts to repatriate the rest of the former pows 
a french news report said troops of chads new government on 
sunday began dismantling a wellarmed camp reputedly used by the 
libyans agence francepresse said the pows camp about six miles 
north of ndjamena was wellstocked with arms and communications 
equipment 
other former pows returned to libya which helped arm debys 
fighters 
chadian forces captured the libyan fighters in clashes in 1983 
and 1987 chad and libya have battled on and off in a border 
dispute for more than 20 years

an attorney for an army national guard 
sergeant asked a federal judge monday to order his return from the 
persian gulf until president bush gets congressional permission to 
wage war on iraq 
michael ratner a lawyer for the center for constitutional 
rights argued that sgt michael r ange of beaufort nc should 
be returned from active duty in the middle east because he faces 
the realistic threat he will be required to fight in an 
unconstitutional war 
ratner argued that president bush has violated both the war 
powers clause of the constitution and the 1973 war powers 
resolution by preparing for war with iraq without obtaining 
permission from congress 
the lawyer asked us district judge royce lamberth to affirm 
what every school child knows that congress has the power to 
declare war 
but justice department attorney john tyler urging the court to 
stay out of the dispute said bush has never ruled out the 
possibility that he would ask congress to authorize the use of 
force to drive iraqi forces from kuwait 
we dont know that the president will not seek authority from 
congress he has never so stated tyler said 
ratner citing statements from bush and other administration 
officials said there is strong evidence that the president 
would launch an attack on iraqi troops without seeking 
congressional approval 
ange a police officer was activated last month when his 
national guard unit was mobilized and sent to fort lee va he was 
unsuccessful in winning a temporary restraining order to block his 
deployment to the persian gulf 
now seeking an injunction ordering his removal from the middle 
east ange contends that bush violated the war powers resolution by 
failing to report to congress that he had sent troops into a 
situation of imminent hostilities 
under the resolution the president must end such a deployment 
in 60 days unless congress authorizes its continuation 
lamberth noted that bush told congress after sending troops to 
saudi arabia that he didnt consider hostilities to be imminent 
the judge expressed doubts over whether the requirement that 
bush seek authority from congress before waging war so clearly 
expressed by the constitution 
there have been a number of instances where presidents have 
proceeded without a declaration of war lamberth said alluding 
to more than 200 occasions when us troops fought or threatened to 
fight without congressiional approval the nation has fought five 
wars declared by congress 
if you look at some of the early things that happened in the 
lifetime of the actual framers the way these presidents acted 
would give you some pause as to whether the constitution was that 
clear lamberth said in reference to early american military 
adventures that included combat with the barbary pirates of north 
africa in 18011805 and again in 1815 
tyler urged dismissal of anges lawsuit on the ground that the 
court was incapable of determining what were basically political 
questions best addressed by congress and the president 
the complexity of the persian gulf situation defies the 
courts ability to step in tyler said 
lamberth questioned whether he was in a position to judge 
whether bush was really preparing for war or just trying to bluff 
iraqi leader saddam hussein into removing his troops from iraq 
how do i decide this is a real threat of war by the president 
rather than something else to ensure that peace occurs the judge 
asked 
lamberth did not indicate when he would rule a lawsuit by 54 
democratic lawmakers that challenges bushs power to wage war 
without congressional approval is pending before another judge in 
the same court

evacuated to a hotel or to stay in their homes we thought it was 
for our convenience because we wouldnt have heat we were never

on her door told her there was no danger for us to stay here 
lt col bill carey provost marshal said we didnt feel the

someone with a powerful shotgun has shot 
at nine homes in the dead of night in the past two weeks and 
terrified residents have taken to sleeping on floors and removing 
christmas lights 
i just thank god it hit away from the part of the house where 
everyone was sleeping michele michalides said after her sliding 
glass door was shattered by a slug its amazing people havent 
gotten hurt 
michalides home was one of four hit saturday the shootings 
which began nov 27 occurred in different neighborhoods within a 
few miles of each other and only one house has been hit twice 
the home of police chief thomas king 
chief was standing within 12 feet of where the bullet came 
through deputy chief paul brodeur said he said the first time 
kings home was hit police believed it was a coincidence but now 
theyre not so sure 
its hard to believe its not directed at him he said 
brodeur said a man and his wife were showered with glass as they 
watched television and a little girl who got up from bed to use the 
bathroom was missed by just feet 
the type of weapon apparently a 12gauge shotgun loaded with 
slugs is particularly alarming 
they have extreme penetrating power and can travel through 
walls like nothing detective mark putney said these are the 
type of guns used for hunting large game 
police said they have no motive or suspects they are telling 
people in the area to keep their blinds and drapes drawn at night 
and keep lights off authorities have beefed up patrols in the area 
and 2000 has been offered for help in arresting and convicting 
the perpetrators 
hearing a news report that people might be arming themselves 
mayor ray wieczorek urged them not to do anything foolhardy 
michalides said she was dozing on the couch when the sound of 
her decks glass door shattering made her bolt upright 
i cant get the sound out of my head she said i was 
running around the house screaming i didnt know it was a gunshot 
if i had seen the holes in the wall i would have been in a million 
pieces myself 
the slugs went through the wood deck railing burst the door 
hit the back wall of the dining room and ricocheted into the living 
room 
now michalides keeps her curtains drawn and her lights out after 
dark and worries that her four children might get up in the middle 
of the night to get a drink 
across the street syvie gosselin has her two daughters 12 and 
9 sleeping on the floor but the youngest slept with her parents 
sunday night she said a friend down the street moved her children 
upstairs and took the lighted christmas decorations out of the 
windows 
mine arent going up this year either gosselin said 
roberta veilleux whose home was hit also draws her curtains 
but still plans to put up a christmas tree with lights

communist leader ramiz alia agreed on 
monday to meet with striking students a day after police engaged 
in fist fights with student demonstrators 
a diplomat in tirana reached by telephone earlier in the day 
reported there some people were hurt and many were arrested in 
sundays rare show of public defiance against the communist regime 
the situation at tirana university continues to be in 
disorder the official ata news agency said late monday in 
reporting on what appeared a fullscale protest of university 
students in the albanian capital 
it said most students boycotted classes gathering instead at 
dormitories to draw up a demand for a meeting with alia to 
express to him their problems and troubles alia is both head of 
state and chief of the communist party 
ata said sunday that the students were infuriated by a power 
outage that left dormitories without heat and light it said 
demonstrators tried to exploit the situation for political 
ends 
the brief dispatch appeared to be the first instance that 
official news media reported on a confrontation between police and 
demonstrators before foreign media 
this was in line with recent moves to slowly open albania to the 
outside world and ease controls on the countrys 32 million 
citizens 
albanian leaders have rejected multiparty democracy of the kind 
that has replaced orthodox marxist rule in other east european 
countries 
it was learned that comrade ramiz alia accepted the 
students request to meet and discuss with a students 
representation recommending the others to pursue regularly classes 
at the university ata said monday 
but it said that by monday night no meeting with alia had taken 
place because the students have not yet chosen their 
representatives 
ata said education minister skender gjinushi transmitted alias 
message to striking students a clear sign of how seriously the 
protest is being taken 
the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said sundays 
demonstration started at 10 am and lasted until police dispersed 
protesters at 1 pm he said a great many students took part 
but gave no estimates

vice president dan quayle accused 
congressional democrats on monday of playing politics with the 
persian gulf crisis saying some of them are portraying 
themselves as the party of peace and the republican 
administration as bent on war 
he did not name any democrats as he asked republican governors 
to help counter that message by speaking out for president bushs 
policy 
quayle denounced senate and house hearings on us policy toward 
iraq as a vehicle for criticism without accountability although 
bush had said those inquiries were all right with him 
they felt compelled to have hearings but not compelled to 
allow the full congress to vote on the actions taken by the 
president quayle told the republican governors association 
when a governor asked why the administration didnt seek a 
conditional declaration of war quayle said that had posed a 
dilemma because there is no perceived consensus in the 
congress and division or restrictive measures could undercut 
bush policy 
despite his criticism quayle said he believes that when the 
chips are down when americas vital interests are on the line the 
majority of congress can rise above partisan politics and will 
support bush 
the vice president said solid congressional unity behind bush 
would strengthen the chances for peace 
but that would require congress to resist the temptation to 
use the current hearings on the gulf for partisan political 
advantage he said unfortunately by portraying themselves as 
the party of peace and the administration as the party of war some 
congressional democrats but by no means all congressional 
democrats seem to have placed partisanship above statesmanship 
in washington sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed 
services committee which held hearings on persian gulf policy was 
not available for comment according to his press aide scott 
williams 
williams pointed to some of nunns appearance saturday on the 
cnn evans and novak in which nunn said i think the hearings 
have been very responsible and when the guns start firing and 
when the troops are in war i think you will find sam nunn and most 
other people behind the american flag and behind the men and women 
who are over there risking their lives 
earlier another administration official had urged the governors 
to push for a capital gains tax cut as a step to get the economy 
moving and ease the dual pressures of slumping state revenues and 
increasing needs 
it is time for if you will a reagantype tax cut 
secretary of housing and urban development jack kemp told them 
the revenues of the states are suffering from the high tax on 
capital gains over which you have no control unless you join the 
debate kemp said 
to the argument that a policy seeking to generate tax revenues 
by cutting tax rates is a free lunch dream kemp replied 
there is a free lunch to governors it is that if we get this 
economy moving again at the federal level it will be felt at the 
state level 
he said the capital gains tax rate should be cut to 15 percent 
as president bush proposed this year and eliminated entirely on 
assets held for longer than three years 
it would unlock trillions of dollars kemp said benefit all 
americans and disprove democratic assertions that republicans want 
tax cuts that benefit only the rich 
opening the twoday conference gov james g martin of north 
carolina told his colleagues state governments in all parts of 
this great nation are being squeezed caught in that vise 
between declining revenues and pressing needs 
he said it will take innovation and more productive use of 
dwindling tax resources to deal with the problem 
but there were more speeches on the challenge than specific 
answers to the dilemma 
william j bennett the outgoing drug policy director who is to 
become chairman of the republican national committee next month 
told the governors that politicians in both parties should stop 
talking past each other and find steps that will work to improve 
the lives of americans who need help 
he said his list includes protection against crime and violence 
better education and equal opportunity 
bennett said equal opportunity doesnt require affirmative 
action that would involve preference by race in hiring or 
education he said he thinks affirmative action should be an issue 
of political debate 
democratic leaders plan to try to reenact the civil rights bill 
president bush vetoed earlier this year on grounds it would impose 
racial quotas the administration plans to propose its own version 
once again 
republicans made the quota question an issue in this years 
campaign especially in north carolina and california bennett said 
it is a debate that should continue 
i do think this is an issue that we should talk about he 
told reporters 
he said he favors affirmative action if it means that minority 
americans get equal word of opportunities for jobs or education 
and an equal opportunity to fill them bennett said if minority 
applicants get an edge because schools or employers want to promote 
diversity on their rosters that is okay with him diversity is 
not a bad end and aim in itself he said 
a dozen gop governors three governorselect and one candidate 
were attending the conference im a governorelect in limbo 
said fife symington of arizona who led narrowly in the nov 6 
election but did not get a clear majority and faces a feb 26 
runoff election

said tuesday he wants his island republic readmitted to the british 
commonwealth 
fiji was excluded from the commonwealth in 1987 after a newly 
elected indiandominated government was overthrown by two military 
coups the queen was replaced as head of state and a republic 
declared 
in an interview with the fiji times newspaper ratu mara 
criticized the commonwealths veto rules that allow one 
memberstate to determine whether others should be allowed to join 
or be barred he called for a ruling saying the majority of 
commonwealth countries should determine member applications 
in a bitter diplomatic row india has vowed to veto any reentry 
application in protest over a new constitution that favors 
indigenous fijians over other races including ethnic indians 
ratu mara was quoted as saying that he would like to see fiji 
back in the commonwealth fold 
but i dont know how we could return because i dont know how 
we were ousted from it he said i hope a system is devised 
whereby the views of the majority of members determine whether a 
new member is admitted or an old member returns

british last century as indentured sugar plantation workers 
comprised a majority of fijis 720000 population but emigration

fresh conflicts between arizonas two senators 
surfaced monday at ethics hearings on the relationship between five 
senators and former sampl owner charles h keating jr 
a former employee of keating testified before the senate ethics 
committee that sen dennis deconcini dariz called him and 
expressed keen interest in critical comments the executive made 
about sen john mccain rariz 
the exemployee david e stevens wrote the committee last 
october that mccain had never intended to reimburse keatings 
company for his wifes cost of trips the couple took on keatings 
corporate airplanes 
monday stevens said of this and other critical statements in 
his letter i wish i had written these differently 
stevens who handled tax matters for keatings american 
continental corp said deconcini was sent a copy of the letter and 
called him at home on nov 26 
deconcini asked whether an affidavit could be prepared based on 
his letter 
he said that he wasnt using my letter to hurt mccain and in 
fact he didnt think the letter would hurt him stevens said in 
an written account of his converstion with deconcini released by 
the committee 
stevens also said in his testimony monday that deconcini 
asked would you mind if i released this to the press 
the letter in fact did reach the press although stevens said 
the matter of public release was left unresolved in his 
conversation with deconcini 
the trips by mccain and his wife on keatings planes from 
198486 have not figured prominently so far in hearings on the five 
senators assistance to keating and interventions with sampl 
regulators on his behalf mccain reimbursed keatings american 
continental corp for the trips in 1989 and was cleared of 
wrongdoing by the house and senate ethics committees 
the trips were made when mccain was a member of the house 
earlier in the hearings aides to both senators gave much 
different accounts of conversations between the lawmakers just 
before they participated in crucial meetings with thrift 
regulators on keatings behalf in 1987 other subjects of the 
ethics probe are sens donald w riegle jr dmich john glenn 
dohio and alan cranston dcalif 
before stevens testified former us customs commissioner 
william von raab told the committee that senators often intervened 
with him on behalf of constituents 
von raab testified for sen dennis deconcini one of five 
senators under investigation for intervening with thrift regulators 
on behalf of charles h keating jr 
asked by committee member warren rudman rnh where you 
would draw that line of unacceptable conduct by senators von 
raab replied if someone tried to bribe me 
deconcini was the only one of the five senators present as von 
raab testified that lawmakers often asked him to grant waivers for 
constituents and to reconsider regulations 
the committee held its 15th day of hearings on the relationship 
between the five senators and keating who with associates 
contributed 13 million to the lawmakers campaigns and causes 
the five senators asked thrift regulators in 1987 to reconsider 
a regulation limiting risky investments such as those undertaken by 
keatings failing lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif 
lincoln was seized in april 1989 at a potential cost to 
taxpayers of more than 2 billion 
regulators testified that deconcini sought to negotiate a waiver 
of the rule for lincoln and used the word we to indicate he was 
speaking for the other senators 
regulators contend that deconcini improperly negotiated on 
keatings behalf at that meeting 
von raab said he had never been confronted by lawmakers under 
the exact circumstances as those faced by banking regulators when 
the five senators met with them in april 1987 
committee special counsel robert s bennett noted that those 
meetings were held without aides on behalf of a single constituent 
lincoln which already had been found in violation of the rule 
on direct investments 
all you have said is sen deconcini is a friend f yours and 
all of your dealings with him have been honorable and 
appropriate committee member sen jesse helms rnc told von 
raab 
von raab said there were circumstances when lawmakers had 
intervened with him for constituents seeking reduction of fines and 
waiver of regulations for constituents 
i never felt intervention seeking one of those results 
had been improper he said 
other witnesses testified in deconcinis defense describing 
help he provided for law enforcement drugtreatment projects and 
disabled veterans they said he acted without regard to campaign 
contributions 
i could not imagine how he could have done anything more

bulldozers at an island 
construction zone on st thomas have unearthed an achaeological 
site that could date to 900 years before columbus first visited the 
virgin islands 
archaeologist elizabeth righter and volunteers from the national 
park service in atlanta are carefully documenting the dig and 
indications are it is about 1400 years old 
its getting more extraordinary by the minute righter said 
monday were finding much more than we ever dared to hope 
finds thus far have revealed two skeletons food remains a 
possible ball court and handicrafts 
preliminary examination of the skeletons indicates the man and 
woman were about 4foot 7inches tall and stocky with 
welldeveloped shoulders 
righter speculates they hiked the islands steep hills to and 
from the sea carrying loads on their shoulders 
righter said the food remains are important because they contain 
charcoal and pottery the charcoal can be carbondated to fix a 
moreprecise time for each layer of the settlement 
food remains indicate a diet of crab whelks reef fish turtle 
and cassava bread 
the ball court is the first to be found on st thomas righter 
says pieces of what may be stone collars worn around the 
ballplayers hips to hit the ball in a soccerlike game have been 
found 
elaborately carved shell ornaments and finely crafted pottery 
similar to what is now in venezuela are also among the ruins 
planning and natural resources earth change inspector tom 
linnio first discovered signs of the village during a routine 
inspection after inland property was cleared for the shopping area 
righter has been operating from donations including those from 
the development owner william mahaffey virgin islands telephone 
corp gassett motors and st thomas historic trust 
labor has been donated by the virgin islands national guard 
national park archaeologists are donating their time as are 
members of the st thomas historic trust the explorers club and 
the st thomasst john environmental association 
meanwhile the construction project is on hold until exploration 
is completed mahaffey said he will display a replica of the 
village in a 30foot glass rotunda in the middle of the completed

khartoum every two weeks 
the government has denied earlier claims that it was forcing the 
displaced people to return to the wartorn south 
in other parts of sudan authorities are discouraging the 
establishment of refugee camps where thousands have recently 
arrived escaping a famine the government is apparently trying to 
avoid a repetition of sudans 198485 tragedy when thousands died 
in camps from lack of adequate food and medicines 
thousands of people fleeing hunger in the western region of 
kordofan arrived at a camp near the regional capital elobeid 
they are to be given a months supply of food and sent home

him when he returned to earth on monday after eight days as the 
first journalist and the first japanese in space he had not 
however not forgotten his fondness for beer

site in the soviet union it seems like i came back as a mass of 
desire 
otherwise he said after the weightlessness of life in space 
he felt heavy heavy i thought i could stand but i felt i have 
no legs 
akiyama rode back to earth in a soyuz space capsule with soviet 
cosmonauts gennadi manakov and gennadi strekalov who were winding 
up a fourmonth stay aboard the mir space station 
akiyama is a news director for tokyo broadcasting system which 
paid the soviets 12 million for his rocket ride and short stay at 
the space station and spent an additional 25 million on the 
project it expects to lose 74 million on the venture even after 
firguring in advertising revenues and proceeds from documentaries 
and lectures by akiyama 
tbs showed exclusive live telecasts from their astroreporter 
each night during his odyssey which enjoyed high ratings he 
expressed concern about global pollution he viewed from orbit he 
even recited japanese haiku poetry 
the newsman was mobbed by tbs reporters upon emerging waving 
and smiling from the capsule they sped to the landing site the 
frozen tundra in kazakstan republic in central asia to beam live 
to japan his thoughts upon arriving back on earth 
yes its very beautiful he said when asked how it felt to 
be back 
tbs then arranged for akiyama to speak to his wife kyoko who 
watched the landing from the companys tokyo studios 
im back said akiyama wrapped in a parka and with his 
space helmet still in place 
i worried a bit replied his wife 
did the kids do all right on their exams he asked 
why ask such things now she said 
i want to eat something good 
ive prepared it his wife reassured him 
akiyama told viewers my body was in a state of 
weightlessness say about one hour ago that is to say my body 
including brain and stomach was in a condition like floating 
now everything is being attracted downward i think i can 
easily raise my legs but i have a strange feeling that i must form 
an intention to do so 
he said it seemed like he was feeling weight and air for the 
first time 
tbs devoted the entire day to covering events surrounding his 
landing which came at about 305 pm local time 
the network rented four helicopters when a reporter from one 
copter spotted the capsule plummeting to earth he yelled i see 
it i see it its there its there 
reporters were at the site less than 10 minutes after touchdown 
his voyage began dec 2 with liftoff from baikonur cosmodrome 
about 1300 miles east of moscow he and two soviet cosmonauts 
linked up with mir tuesday 
he took with him six japanese tree frogs to test how they adapt 
to weightlessness 
prime minister toshiki kaifu told reporters the mission was 
significant for success in sovietjapanese cooperation i expect 
this to a produce a very good influence 
having a paying passenger aboard was a major step in soviet 
efforts to commercialize their space program 
japanese corporate sponsors including a diaper maker and a 
toothpaste company had their logos and names plastered on the 
rocket that launched akiyama into space

the baghdad government made its most bellicose statement in weeks 
on kuwait saying it would not compromise one iota in its claim 
to the emirate it seized on aug 2 
president bush in a washington speech proclaiming monday as 
human rights day denounced the iraqi takeover of kuwait as a 
systematic assault on the soul of a nation 
defense secretary dick cheney meanwhile said iraqs move to 
free the foreigners should not create unrealistic expectations 
about a resolution to the gulf crisis he also said iraqi president 
saddam hussein deserved no particular praise for deciding to end 
his abhorrent hostage holding 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz however complained that 
iraqis were confused by the hardline statements from us 
officials following the hostage release 
we thought that this unanimous decision on the part of my 
president would create a positive atmosphere said aziz in an 
interview monday with cable news network 
even as the freed hostages were streaming out of iraq more and 
more military forces converged on the gulf region 
france announced it would increase its troops by an unspecified 
number and cheney said saddam had been sending in reinforcements 
in recent days 
despite the continued talk of war there was little that could 
dampen the hostages joy at coming home a pan american flight from 
frankfurt germany arrived at andrews air force base outside 
washington late monday afternoon with 152 americans and four 
canadians 
those aboard the militarychartered flight had flown out of 
baghdad the day before the first americans to go free under an 
iraqi decree releasing all foreign hostages some in that group 
were taking later flights home 
at the frankfurt stopover many appeared thin and tired after 
their 4month ordeal in captivity 
it was like a gulag said 58yearold robert vinton of santa 
fe nm who was held south of baghdad at an oil refinery 
provisions on board the usbound flight included big macs and 
champagne us officials said 
at andrews the former hostages appeared tired but most smiled 
as they left the plane relatives in the crowd held up signs 
including one that said daddy daddy i need you 
the group got on three buses to be taken to a processing area 
and made no public comments 
another 123 british australian and irish citizens arrived in 
london aboard two flights from rome and frankfurt 
i feel euphoric said freed british hostage harvey may 
australian steve hicking proposed to his girlfriend when she met 
him at londons heathrow airport she said yes 
also 384 westerners about 227 of them britons left baghdad 
aboard a britishchartered flight on monday diplomats said some 
americans were aboard but were unable to give an immediate 
breakdown 
us officials said they planned to charter another flight from 
baghdad in three or four days to evacuate the rest of the estimated 
750 americans in iraq and kuwait britain said it hoped to fly out 
another 320 britons and others on tuesday 
saddam said thursday that all the foreign hostages could leave 
about 8000 westerners had been trapped since the invasion of 
kuwait including about 600 held at strategic sites as human 
shields against possible attack by the usdominated 
multinational force 
a rapid us buildup of that force is in progress aimed at 
bringing troop strength in the region to 400000 by midjanuary 
that coincides with the jan 15 deadline the un security council 
gave saddam for getting out of kuwait or facing possible military 
action 
word of the french decision to send in more troops came from 
defense minister jeanpierre chevenement who said the size of the 
increase would be announced later france currently has about 6200 
army and air force troops in saudi arabia where most of the 
multinational force is deployed 
iraq is building up its forces too cheney told a defense 
industry group in washington even as saddam freed hostages cheney 
said he has simultaneously continued to build up his deployments 
in kuwait to enhance his fortifications and to add additional 
forces to the regions 
the defense secretary said despite the release of the hostages 
saddam has given us absolutely no indication whatsoever of any 
intention of withdrawing from kuwait 
the latest show of iraqi defiance on that point came from the 
baghdad governments information minister latif jassim who said 
any notion of an iraqi withdrawal was nothing but dreams and 
wishful thinking 
kuwait is iraqi whether in the past present or future he 
said in a statement carried by the official iraqi news agency we 
will not compromise one iota on kuwaiti territory 
some weekend reports had said iraq had redrawn its border with 
kuwait in possible preparation for a partial pullout 
the reports in the observer of london and the alkhaleej daily 
in abu dhabi said saddams aim was to keep the entire rumailah 
oilfield and two islands warba and bubiyan which would give it 
access to the persian gulf 
the oilfield which lies chiefly in iraq extends two miles into 
kuwait and saddam accused kuwait of overexploiting it before he 
invaded 
also monday coretta scott king was at the united nations with a 
coalition of peace activists trying to organize nationwide peace 
demonstrations on jan 15 
that is the deadline in the un resolution calling on iraq to 
get out of kuwait it is also the birthdate of mrs kings husband 
slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
we will not tolerate making this a day of war and military 
aggression she said 
in other developments 
crude oil prices rose 32 cents monday to close at 2690 per 
barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
the pentagon said it is sending more f15 eagle fighter planes 
to the gulf elements of the 36th tactical fighter wing at bitburg 
germany will deploy starting dec 28 it did not say how many 
planes will go a tactical fighter wing normally would include 
about 70 aircraft an undisclosed number of f15s was sent to the 
gulf in august 
the army on monday also announced it was ordered to active duty 
1457 members of national guard and reserve units in 20 states the 
activations brought to 120281 the number of reservists called to 
active duty in all four services

german news media on monday reported links 
between a former east german secret police officer and lothar de 
maiziere the nations last leader and now a member of chancellor 
helmut kohls cabinet 
the reports identifying de maizieres control officer 
followed an earlier media allegation that de maiziere worked for 
the nowdisbanded secret police known as the stasi 
kohl spokesman hans klein said the chancellor was reserving 
judgment until a full probe is completed de maiziere now is a 
ministerwithoutportfolio in the cabinet 
de maiziere has repeatedly denied the allegations he guided 
east germany to unity with west germany on oct 3 and was his 
nations only democratically elected leader 
the scandal broke over the weekend after der spiegel magazine 
said an index card in stasi files contained the cover name of a 
stasi informer and de maizieres address in former east berlin 
another news magazine stern and the newspaper bild reported 
monday they had found de maizieres reputed control officer 
identified as former stasi maj edgar hasse 
bild quoted the man as saying i was his de maizieres 
control officer i met with de maiziere regularly 
stern said it has found other former stasi employees who also 
claim that de maiziere had been an important informer 
stern quoted hasse as saying he recruited de maiziere then an 
attorney in 1982 
hasse claimed de maiziere provided the stasi with information 
about east german church leaders the magazine reported de 
maiziere had close contacts with lutheran church officials 
stern telexed copies of its report to other news media in 
advance of thursdays publication 
stern said eberhard jaekel identified as another former stasi 
officer also claims that de maiziere had been an informer 
but the issue is complicated by stasi files being kept under 
lock and key in former east berlin under the unification treaty 
access to the files is tightly controlled because of their highly 
sensitive nature 
kohls government has asked the official who safeguards the 
files joachim gauck to examine them as part of the probe 
de maizieres friends and political allies on monday said they 
believe his denials 
ill believe mr de maiziere before i believe a former stasi 
officer said otto lambsdorff head of the free democrats junior 
partners in kohls coalition 
volker ruehe general secretary of kohls christian democrats 
said the party believes de maiziere until there is proof to the 
contrary

prosecutors dropped criminal charges monday 
against a record store owner who sold the 2 live crew album as 
nasty as they wanna be saying they couldnt prove the sexually 
explicit lyrics were obscene 
dave rishers trial was about to begin when bexar county 
courtatlaw judge tony jimenez iii dismissed the charges at the 
prosecutors request he also asked sternly why it took them six 
months to come up emptyhanded 
i think that the district attorneys office owes mr risher 
an apology he said when he dismissed the court spectators 
clapped and cheered 
risher was charged after patrick weaver son of the president of 
citizens against pornography bought the album at hogwild records 
and tapes in june and then complained to police it was obscene the 
album includes references to oral and anal sex and sexual violence 
against women 
the case apparently fell apart when weaver listened to the album 
last friday with the prosecutors and decided it didnt violate 
state obscenity laws expert witnesses also told prosecutors they 
werent sure the rap albums contents met the states test for 
obscenity 
taken as a whole he weaver did not feel that this album was 
obscene hancock said afterward that is a weakness in our 
case we obviously felt that trying the case would have been an 
injustice 
among other criteria material can only be called obscene in 
texas if it is found by a reasonable person to be without literary 
artistic or political value 
weaver 20 declined to be interviewed later but his mother 
teresa weaver said in a call to their home that as much as he 
wanted to address was already addressed 
i thought we were going to trial today im pleasantly 
surprised said risher who had been charged with promotion of 
pornography the misdemeanor carries a maximum penalty of a year in 
prison and a 1000 fine 
i cant wait to get back to work said risher owner of 
hogwild records and tapes 
risher was charged after san antonio vice officers visited 
record stores and told owners that a federal judge in florida had 
found the album obscene after that ruling a fort lauderdale 
fla record owner was convicted of a misdemeanor obscenity charge 
members of the miamibased rap group were acquitted however of 
similar charges that followed a live performance in hollywood fla 
after the obscenity declaration in florida officers here asked 
store operators to sign statements saying they had been given the 
warning risher refused 
days after the warning patrick weaver whose mother is 
president of an antipornography group bought the album at 
rishers store and filed a complaint with police 
i cant wait to get back to work said risher owner of 
hogwild records and tapes 
there was no immediate reaction from 2 live crew to mondays 
dismissal

cheering crowd as they streamed off a charter flight at andrews air 
force base outside washington

were illprepared for the chilly evening weather

individuals spoke freely at a hotel later

in iraq but people are scared in iraq he said clutching the 
hand of his wife kathy 
everybody has mental stress coming out of there said

both durmon and rinehart said president bush was doing well in 
the crisis rinehart observing i think george bush and the 
administration have handled this beautifully 
william armbruster a press officer for the us embassy in 
kuwait who worked at the us embassy in baghdad after aug 23 
said one iraqi citizen told him tell george bush that whatever 
he is doing has got to be done 
in an interview with cbs news ed wener of baltimore said he and 
four other people stayed indoors in kuwait we would have to 
travel from house to hoiuse once in a while though when we heard 
the iraqis were in the neighborhood

about 20 iraqi soldiers just opened up on him killing him

european and japanese hostages on friday at the request of 
president saddam hussein the hostages were trapped when iraq

see it still stands fitzwater said the iraqis he added were 
still totally in control 
fitzwater declined to give any precise numbers of how many 
americans remain in iraq and kuwait 
this is kind of a touchy question he said wed prefer 
the iraqis dont know exactly how many people we had there 
in frankfurt the former hostages told reporters they were glad 
to be free 
it was like a gulag said robert vinton of santa fe nm he 
was picked up on aug 18 on a street in baghdad and held at an oil 
refinery 
vinton 58 said he was held with eight other foreigners we 
were mostly left alone he said

mayor david dinkins said monday the city has 
found yet another shortfall in its current budget adding 250 
million to the evergrowing shortage 
he blamed cuts in state aid and the weakening economy 
dinkins just recently closed a 388 million gap inthe 1991 
fiscal year budget which ends june 30 
asked at a news conference in city hall how he would close the 
new projected gap the mayor answered that it will take more 
pain he indicated he might have to turn to a contingency plan he 
developed while planning the earlier cut but that totals only 40 
million 
the plan includes the closing of six firehouses and cutbacks in 
refuse collection funding for senior citizen centers and food 
pantries elimination of a nutrition program and some day care 
staff advisers plus delays in bridge inspection and repair 
programs as well as maintenance at parks playgrounds and beaches 
dinkins disclosed the possible new gap in the 28 billion budget 
after attending a meeting with the standard amp poors bond rating 
agency the agency has already put the city on a credit watch and 
is to evaluate a municipal longterm bond issue of 13 billion 
wednesday 
deputy mayor sally hernandez piniero said sampp currently rates 
city bonds as aminus she said moodys rates them at a 
dinkins said he assured sampp executives that the city which 
underwent a fiscal crisis in the mid1970s has acted responsibly 
in balancing its budget for years 
he said that the city has closed 18 billion in holes in its 
budget during his term and that of former mayor edward i koch in 
the latter part of 1989 
the mayor said he hoped that sampp would maintain the citys 
current rating at least until he presents his preliminary budget 
for the 1992 fiscal year which starts july 1 that budget already 
has a 13 billion gap that the mayor said he plans to fill as 
well

the united states warned vietnam monday that 
resisting the majorpower formula for ending the cambodian civil 
war endorsed by the united nations would hurt its prospects for 
normal diplomatic relations with the united states 
hanois own interests would be best served by supporting 
rather than resisting the progress made toward a cambodian 
settlement assistant secretary of state richard solomon told a 
subcommittee of the house foreign affairs committee 
although vietnam has made some statements expressing willingness 
to support the unbacked formula other statements are at best 
ambiguous or put forward positions in basic opposition solomon 
told the subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs 
solomon said hanoi should reexamine its position and 
influence the vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia to accept 
the settlement drafted by the united states soviet union china 
britain and france the five permament un security council 
members and recently endorsed by the council and general assembly 
in answer to questions solomon said it was inconceivable 
that the bush administration would normalize relations with vietnam 
or the government in phnom penh cambodia if the un peace plan 
is scuttled 
american business groups have been pressing for ending the us 
trade embargo against vietnam hanoi has sought normalization to 
bolster its weak economy solomon reaffirmed the us 
longstanding policy that normalization of relations with vietnam 
can occur only in the context of an acceptable comprehensive 
settlement of the cambodian conflict 
the hearing heard solomons assessments of a decline in the 
prospects for early peace and prevention of a return to power of 
the communist khmer rouge blamed for more than one million 
cambodian deaths in 197578 
unfortunately the phonm penh regime has recently issued a 
series of statements opposing basic tenets of the current draft 
settlement only the khmer rouge are likely to benefit if the 
plan is scuttled solomon said 
solomon represented the united states in drafting the big five 
formula providing for a united nations presence to organize free 
elections temporarily oversee government and disarm the southeast 
asian countrys warring factions 
phonm penh leaders demanded that the un presence last less 
than a year and be limited to organizing an election leaving their 
powers unaffected solomon said a fair and workable settlement 
cannot be achieved on this basis he added 
at worst once again in the control of the khmer rouge 
cambodia may yet again be transformed into an asian auschwitz 
said subcommittee chairman rep stephen solarz dny referring to 
the notorious nazi extermination camp where millions perished in 
world war ii 
unfortunately there appears a very real reason to believe 
this plan may not be accepted he added referring to 
disagreement among the cambodian factions and the recent statements 
from phonm penh even at best solarz said cambodia could end up 
like the lebanon of southeast asia 
deputy assistant secretary of state kenneth quinn said the khmer 
rouge were regaining some popularity using cambodian animosity 
against the vietnamese as a guerrilla recruiting tool with time on 
the side of the khmer rouge hanoi and phomh penh could serve their 
own interests by accepting a settlement providing for 
internationally enforced disarmament he said

tuesday with president bush and western diplomats said the united 
states was seeking to avoid a vote until after shamir leaves the

of palestinians in israelioccupied lands 
the united states wants mention of the proposed conference moved 
from the heart of a resolution to a nonbinding preamble and 
presidential statement 
the united states also opposed any language in the resolution 
that could suggest it is linked to iraqi president saddam husseins 
calls for a mideast conference to help settle the persian gulf 
crisis us officials have indicated they may veto the draft 
resolution unless significant changes were made 
the united states has been caught in a diplomatic dilemma it is 
pressured by its israeli ally to veto the measure any reference to 
a un conference but us officials also fear a veto could weaken 
support from arab nations that joined the coalition against iraq 
following its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the council voted 94 to adopt a soviet motion to delay the 
session 
the united states had pushed for postponement while france and 
china abstained cuba colombia malaysia and yemen opposed any 
delay and sought an immediate vote 
any of the five permanent security council members the united 
states france britain soviet union and china can veto a 
measure

small hills of bagged garbage began to crowd 
sidewalks in parts of manhattan on monday the first day of a 
strike by workers employed by private haulers 
residential garbage collection is performed by the new york city 
sanitation department and was not affected by the strike if 
accumulating garbage becomes a health or fire hazard however the 
agency will make emergency pickups 
a 2100member teamsters local called the strike after union 
members rejected a new contract raising wages 70 over three years 
the workers now earn 600 to 700 a week and sought a 90 raise 
union leader bernard adelstein said the strike was generally 
effective in all five city boroughs although in the bronx a few 
trucks went out with scabs 
salvatore spinelli a spokesman for the private carters said 
about 30 percent of trucks were operating throughout the city 
staffed by management and nonstriking crews some replacement 
workers might also have been hired he said 
about 400 private carters collect 10000 tons of garbage daily 
from 250000 business and commercial sites in new york city 
at least one hauler hired security guards to follow his trucks 
on their route in case of trouble but police spokesman detective 
joseph mcconville said no strikerelated violence was reported 
no talks were scheduled both sides said the next step was up to 
the citys labor negotiator eric schmertz who has been working on 
the dispute 
on monday the most conspicuous uncollected piles of garbage were 
in midtown manhattan mostly on side streets by fastfood outlets 
large movie theaters and restaurants with high turnover 
if health or fire inspectors decide the uncollected garbage is 
dangerous city sanitation crews will pick it up and charge the 
customers 1470 per cubic yard thats the rate the city permits 
private carters to charge 
consumer affairs commissioner mark green whose agency regulates 
hauling rates has recommended that the current fee be cut by about 
1 a cubic yard 
both the union and the private carters accused green of helping 
precipitate the strike 
green said the workers and employers could search for 
scapegoats but any failure in their negotiation is not due to my 
rate 
new york citys private garbage collectors a 1 billion service 
industry were last struck for 17 days in 1981

north korean prime minister yon hyong 
muk crossed the heavily armed border into south korea on tuesday 
for a third round of talks on easing four decades of confrontation 
welcome welcome the souths unification minister hong 
sungchul said in greeting him at the border village of panmunjom 
35 miles north of seoul 
how are you replied yon smiling broadly he bent down to 
allow a little girl to place a wreath of flowers over his head 
then posed for pictures and waved at onlookers 
talks between yon and south korean prime minister kang 
younghoon will take place wednesday and thursday they are the 
third round in as many months of the highest level meetings ever 
held between the two koreas 
the talks are not expected to produce a major agreement but are 
seen as a step in the lengthy process of drawing closer the rival 
koreas have been divided since 1945 
small steady efforts and finally little gains will lead 
to quantitative change said limb dongwon a diplomat and 
spokesman for the souths delegation 
the agenda basically the same as in past talks calls for 
exchanges and easing political and military tensions the north 
wants a nonaggression pact and the south claims confidence 
building agreements are needed first 
the south also will press for official recognition of each 
others governments the north has maintained formal recognition 
would perpetuate division of the peninsula 
midway in the prime ministers talks the souths president roh 
taewoo says will fly to moscow for a summit with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev roh says he will discuss ending the cold 
war on the korean peninsula and realizing a new order of 
reconciliation 
china soviet union and japan neighbors of the hostile koreas 
are seen as important behindthescene forces in the talks 
all three plus the united states which maintains 43000 troops 
in south korea would benefit from a lessening of tensions on the 
peninsula 
korea was divided in 1945 into communist north and capitalist 
south and fought a war from 1950 to 1953

two navy aircraft practicing takeoffs from 
the carrier uss lexington collided monday over the gulf of mexico 
and the two pilots were missing the navy said 
the two ta4 skyhawk aircraft apparently collided in the air at 
410 pm about 85 miles northwest of key west said lt cmdr ray 
kempisty spokesman for naval education and training in pensacola 
where the carrier is based 
the coast guard joined the crew of the lexington in searching 
for the pilots but neither had been found by monday night 
kempisty said 
each of the singleengine jets carried one occupant the navy 
said 
at the time of the crash the weather was fair except for a few 
lowlying clouds and winds of about 11 to 16 mph said the national 
weather service in key west i dont think it would have an 
effect on the visibility meteorologist peter mohlin said 
the ta4s built by mcdonnell douglas corp are capable of 
carrying 10000 pounds of ammunition and can travel at a top speed 
of 675 mph according to janes all the worlds aircraft an 
authoritative annual directory 
the lexington a battlescarred veteran of world war ii is the 
navys oldest carrier at 47 years and the only one used exclusively 
for training naval aviators 
on oct 29 1989 five people were killed when a t2 buckeye 
trainer from meridian miss naval air station crashed into the 
ships control island and cartwheeled across the flight deck in a 
fireball 
the student pilot ensign steven pontell 23 of columbia md 
was making his first attempt to land on a carrier navy safety 
investigators were unable to pinpoint a cause for the crash 
concluding that pilot error or a throttle malfunction may have been 
to blame 
the lexington survived hits from a torpedo and kamikae plane 
during world war ii it earned the nickname blue ghost because of 
its bluegray paint job and repeated reports by japanese 
propagandist tokyo rose that it had been sunk 
the ship is scheduled to be decommissioned next november and 
efforts have begun to preserve it as a museum

a century after her poems were 
published reclusive poet emily dickinson is getting the 
publication party she never had and the kind of thing she probably 
would have hated 
i guess were safe in doing it at this time observed martha 
ackmann an organizer of mondays celebration commemorating the 
publication of the bulk of dickinsons poetry 100 years ago the 
publication came four years after the poets death 
the poet might have deplored the fuss but ackmann said her old 
college is just making up for lost time 
we kind of think of it as the publication party mount holyoke 
never gave emily dickinson an acknowledgement of her 
achievement said ackmann assistant professor of womens studies 
and english at the allwomen school 
about three dozen dickinson devotees gathered monday afternoon 
for a lecture and poetry accompanied by punch and gingerbread 
their reasons for attending varied 
i always liked her poetry for one thing said sarah rusk 
who has lived in south hadley for 50 years 
amherst college senior josh jacobs who came to brush up on the 
poet said he thinks dickinson would probably have lived an 
isolated life in any age 
even now when you think about the industry which seeks so 
persistently to discover people it seems to me that the way she 
lived there could be someone like her today who wont be 
published till 2130 he said 
the enigma of dickinson how she could have been content to see 
only eight of her poems published during her lifetime and those 
anonymosly lies at the heart of the celebration 
the question ive always wanted to ask emily dickinson herself 
is how did she keep going what made her keep working working 
working at it that must have been an enormous respect for art 
ackmann said 
an inability to stop making revisions and a disdain for the 
vulgarities of fame are two possible explanations for dickinsons 
reticence 
in the 19th century a successful author was the equivalent of 
a 20thcentury rock star ackmann said that would have opened 
her life up to public consideration and scrutiny and i dont think 
that she wanted that 
she was ambivalent at best about publishing said jane 
crosthwaite an associate professor of religion and coorganizer of 
the commemoration at mount holyoke which dickinson attended from 
1847 to 1848 
born 160 years ago monday into a welltodo family dickinson 
often sent poems to friends and family but showed no inclination 
to publish ackmann said 
legend has it that she always wore white and toward the end of 
her life rarely left her house and garden 
after her death in 1886 her sister lavinia was clearing out 
dickinsons rooms when she opened up a bottom drawer of a dresser 
and discovered sheet upon sheet upon sheet upon sheet of poems 
ackmann said 
lavinia showed the poems to some friends and family and then 
arranged for their publication on nov 12 1890 by a boston 
publishing firm called roberts bros ackmann said 
the first 500 copies were well received and a second book was 
published the following year 
publication of the poems often written in an unfinished form 
with perhaps six different adjectives stacked on top of one word 
was not completed until the mid1950s 
ackmann and crosthwaite said they dont believe dickinson would 
have regretted her lost celebrity 
she said that if fame were to come to her it would come she 
might be rather relieved that she didnt have to confront either 
the good or the bad readers of her poetry crosthwaite said i 
dont think she wants to be part of the industry

the big funk by john patrick shanley is a 
series of images some provocative some downright silly in search 
of a play 
the new stage work by the academy awardwinning author of 
moonstruck suffers from a bad case of lofty aspirations the 
play foresakes story and character for heavyduty messages about 
life death fear love and other fourletter words oh yes the 
playwright provides two nude scenes one female one male for 
those not moved by words alone you might call it samuel beckett 
meets oh calcutta 
shanley is an accomplished writer whose best plays have a 
gritty distinctive voice and a specific sense of place danny 
and the deep blue sea was a brutal bluecollar apache dance by 
two unlikely lovers in the bronx italianamerican 
reconciliation was a looney romance about an inept gobetween 
trying to save the marriage of a battling husband and wife in new 
yorks little italy 
theres nothing that concrete in the big funk which opened 
monday at offbroadways new york shakespeare festival public 
theater in it shanley who also directed his play settles for 
the abstract the place is here the time now the four main 
characters arrive one by oneto introduce themselves to the 
audience the introductions dont help 
first up is a beautiful young woman jeanne tripplehorn who 
calls herself the villain of the piece shes actually the victim 
putupon by a sleazy guy who picks her up in a bar following her 
on stage is a tightrope walker jayne haynes named fifi and her 
human cannonball of a husband omar graham beckel who walks around 
with what looks like an old pot on his head 
they are best friends with an unemployed actor named austin 
jake weber who saves the girl after she is humiliated in the bar 
shes tormented by that creep skip suddut who smears petroleum 
jelly on her head she also has a thing for salad oil but thats 
not revealed until the second act the first act ends with a bubble 
bath given to the girl by her rescuer at least it quiets the 
audience 
act 2 is a mad hatterstyle dinner for the four friends during 
the meal austin waxes murkily about life for some reason also 
not entirely clear the actor walks offstage and then returns 
naked to lecture the audience on confronting their own fears he 
certainly doesnt have any of his own being able to stand there in 
the buff and remember all his lines 
the actors are cheerful and enthusiastic in their portrayals of 
weirdness and tripplehorn and weber deserve medals for baring more 
than their souls but the big funk remains a collection of odd 
portraits and pictures rather than a play it doesnt say much when 
the most arresting moment on stage is not anything the actors say 
but rather an oozing familysize jar of vaseline spilling to the 
floor of the stage

a man who set himself on fire and died to 
protest us policies in the persian gulf was a genial upbeat 
person who lived alone on a houseboat and rarely discussed 
politics according to his friends 
timothy t brown 48 doused himself with a flammable liquid and 
then set it alight sunday on the steps of a deserted cannery he 
left behind a stack of fliers urging americans to not repeat the 
mistake of vietnam 
brown described himself as vietnam veteran in the leaflets but 
there was no immediate confirmation from defense department 
authorities 
the eaflets were stacked in browns van about 100 yards from 
where brown set himself on fire 
i tim brown vietnam veteran declare that my act of 
selfimmolation is a direct protest of american war policy in the 
middle east he said in the leaflets america do not go to 
war america do not repeat the mistake of vietnam dont wait for 
the war to start and then protest protest now while there is still 
time 
his death stunned his friends 
we were real surprised and shocked said marie carson the 
owner of a florists shop carson who sold brown a houseboat 
earlier this year added that he seemed real upbeat and 
positive 
another neighbor diana dickson said she was baffled by browns 
suicide note because he never talked about anything political 
i hate to invalidate what he said in his letter but i find it 
hard to believe because he hadnt mentioned it before she said

customers from his van was a familiar figure in isleton a tiny 
fishing village in the rustic sacramentosan joaquin delta a lush 
network of levees rivers and small towns about 50 miles east of

israel is confident the united states will not 
permit iraqi leader saddam hussein to link the persian gulf crisis 
to the arabisraeli conflict israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said monday 
the israeli government will not consent to any deal with 
enemies who wish to destroy us shamir said in a speech upon 
receiving the 100000 jabotinsky prize as a defender of 
jerusalem 
we will not be surprised if soon a number of states not only 
arab governments will move to appease saddam hussein at the 
expense of israel shamir said 
the wellknown argument will be that israel should make a 
contribution ostensibly for the sake of world peace let me 
therefore state at the very outset israel in 1990 is not 
czechoslovakia of 1938 he said 
we trust the american governments determined stand not to 
permit saddam hussein to link the gulf crisis with the arabisrael 
conflict and the palestinian issue shamir said 
the iraqi leader knows that israel will not remain passive if 
he tries to harm us shamir said he is trying hard to fool the 
world into believing that he is defending the arabs against what 
they call the zionist enemy he is fooling only himself and his 
blind supporters 
a rapid us buildup of the usdominated multinational force 
is in progress aimed at bringing troop strength in the region to 
400000 by midjanuary that coincides with the jan 15 deadline 
the un security council has given saddam for getting out of 
kuwait or facing possible military action 
on another topic shamir said 1000 to 2000 soviet jews are 
arriving in israel daily 
in the month of november 27000 of our brethren arrived 
with even more expected in december he said 
by the end of 1990 we could arrive at a figure of 180000 for 
the year that equals the number of russian jews who came to israel 
from 1968 to 1988 there is now a realistic expectation that we 
may indeed increase our population by 1 million in the next three 
to five years this is equivalent to the united states absorbing 60 
million immigrants in three to five years he said 
it will cost some 40 billion to absorb the immigrants he said 
adding to provide such a vast sum will require the joint effort 
the aggregate strength and the collective thinking and ingenuity 
of the entire jewish people 
shamir was to leave for washington after speaking monday night 
outside the hotel two small groups demonstrated including 
about 25 people led by rabbi avi weiss who held signs urging 
freedom for jonathan pollard he was sentenced to life in prison in 
1987 for spying for israel 
the other demonstrators represented a coalition of progressive 
jewish groups

if saddam hussein were forced from 
iraq but his military forces were left intact he would claim the 
late gamal abdel nassers mantle as the champion of the arab world 
saudis fear 
saudi officials speaking monday on condition of anonymity 
echoed the concern voiced a day earlier by us secretary of state 
james baker iii baker said that even a peaceful solution to the 
gulf crisis would be followed by continued pressure on saddam to 
curb his military power 
he cant keep his military hell be a hero hell make nasser 
in 1956 look like mickey mouse said one saudi source 
nasser the populist egyptian president who died in 1970 became 
an idol in the arab world after standing up to the french and 
british forces backing israel in the 1956 attempt to reverse his 
nationalization of the suez canal 
he used his panarab nationalism to appeal to public opinion 
across north africa and the middle east destablizing many 
prowestern governments in the process his memory remains a potent 
force in the arab world today 
the saudis see history repeating itself in saddams vast 
military arsenal and political ambitions 
saddam has the biggest and most powerful army in the arab world 
with a million troops a missile armory and other weapons of mass 
destruction 
most officials expect he will find a way to extricate himself 
from kuwait before being attacked by the 26nation alliance that 
began deploying troops in saudi arabia soon after kuwait was 
invaded aug 2 
but even after a retreat saddam will say he stood up not just 
to the united states but to the whole world a saudi source 
said 
the future threat would be both political and military saddams 
invasion of kuwait an emirate disliked by poor arabs for its vast 
oil wealth and limited rights for foreign workers struck a popular 
chord in many parts of the arab world 
it added to his claim of achieving a victory against iran a 
traditional arab enemy in the 198088 war despite having gained 
nothing in the end 
they just love this white stallion stuff saladin and all 
that said an asian diplomat referring to the arab general who 
in 1187 recaptured jerusalem from the european crusaders 
saddam who likens himself to the kurdish saladin is often 
shown on iraqi television heroically mounted on a white charger 
arabs will say hes tough he can solve our problems lets 
follow him the diplomat added 
saddam has already tried to capitalize on that image with his 
attempt to link his withdrawal to an israeli pullout from the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
occupying another arab land and torturing arabs does not give 
hope that the palestinians can be liberated said a senior saudi 
diplomat 
the saudis are concerned that what saddam does not gain through 
charisma he can achieve through the threat of force especially if 
he develops nuclear weapons within the next few years 
they dont want un economic sanctions against iraq lifted 
unless iraq reduces the size and power of his military or at least 
makes unbacked guarantees not to use its arms again on fellow 
arabs 
we cant just stop at the withdrawal the iraqi army has to be 
reduced to a degree that it wont threaten us said the senior 
diplomat 
the saudis despite buying billions of dollars worth of 
advanced weaponry over the last decade found themselves hopelessly 
unable to combat saddam when he invaded kuwait 
the saudis have embarked on a crash expansion of their military 
and are buying more weapons but analysts say that even when that 
program is completed they will still not be able to defend 
themselves without outside help

six deputies were convicted monday of 
conspiring to steal cash from suspected drug dealers in one of the 
worst scandals in the history of the los angeles county sheriffs 
department 
a seventh deputy was convicted of money laundering but the jury 
deadlocked on whether to convict him of conspiracy the panel also 
deadlocked on numerous other charges against all the lawmen 
the seven deputies all former members of an elite narcotics 
unit in the nations most populous county were charged with 
stealing 14 million in drug cash the case caused embarrassment 
and a major shakeup in the department 
prosecutors portrayed the defendants as corrupt individuals who 
abused the public trust and showed evidence that they stashed 
thousands of dollars in shoe boxes and bought boats homes cars 
and vacations and made numerous other purchases beyond their 
40000 to 60000 salaries they dismissed the defendants 
arguments that they bought the items with cash earned through 
gambling inheritance or babysitting 
the defense criticized the prosecutions reliance on testimony 
by drug suspects and the deputies exboss former sgt roger 
sobel who testified as part of a plea agreement 
the deputies were part of a narcotics team called major 
violators crew ii which made some of the departments biggest 
cocaine and money seizures 
authorities accused the men of seizing drug cash during raids 
then obtaining statements from alleged traffickers disowning the 
cash the deputies then allegedly stole a substantial portion of 
the money and divided it among themselves 
the defense said the deputies were victims of their former boss 
sobel who pleaded guilty in the case and testified about alleged 
money skimming operations 
the trial lasted seven weeks and the federal jury deliberated 
just over six days before reaching its verdicts us district 
judge edward rafeedie declared a mistrial on the deadlocked counts 
im sure this jury did the best job they could said one of 
the seven deputy james r bauder but were disappointed 
the verdicts handed down today are not an occasion to 
celebrate sheriff sherman block said monday they are not a 
victory they are the just conclusion to the unlawful actions of a 
few who sought to hide their crimes behind a badge of honor 
the jury concluded that six of the deputies stole 48000 in a 
1989 incident captured by the fbi on videotape but the panel 
deadlocked on other charges and reached notguilty verdicts on 
charges related to the theft of 527000 by three deputies 
convicted of conspiracy and stealing funds earmarked for the 
sheriffs department were bauder daniel garner terrell amers 
eufrasio cortez john dickenson and ronald daub the jury also 
convicted garner amers bauder cortez and daub of filing false 
tax returns

cash transactions to avoid federal reporting requirements of 
transactions of 10000 or more 
cortez and daub also were convicted of money laundering and 
structuring transactions cortez also was convicted of interstate 
transportation of unlawfully gained money

a chinese student returned from the united states 
on monday saying he wants to attend the trial of prodemocracy 
activist wang juntao to see if it is fair 
ge xun 31 who was studying at texas aampm university when last 
years military crackdown occurred said he heard that wang will 
soon be tried for his involvement in the prodemocracy movement 
id like to be a witness of the fairness of the court said 
ge who described himself as wangs friend 
chinese sources say wang editor of a nowbanned economic 
studies weekly and publisher chen zeming were charged with 
plotting to overthrow the government a crime punishable by death 
both were arrested more than a year ago 
the two were accused of manipulating the students who led 
protests urging democratic reforms in june 1989 the army fired on 
protesters hundreds were reported killed thousands were arrested 
in a nationwide crackdown on dissent that followed 
ge said he believes he is taking a risk by planning to push to 
attend the court proceedings but its worth taking because 
without anybody knowing its going to be a secret trial 
chinas constitution guarantees that criminal trials be open to 
the public except in cases involving state secrets private 
affairs of individuals or minors but prior approval is required to 
attend court proceedings so the government could legally prevent 
ge from attending the hearings 
family and friends frequently were barred from past trials of 
political offenders and foreign journalists and other foreign 
observers could not attend 
international human rights groups ask open trials for people 
charged in connection with the prodemocracy movement 
before ge left the united states callers alerted news 
organizations to his plans to attend court sessions and said when 
he would arrive at beijing airport 
upon his arrival ge approached reporters and said he wanted to 
talk but after a few brief comments ge was whisked away by a man 
he said was concerned about his safety 
in the past few weeks court proceedings have started for about 
a dozen people accused of crimes for their involvement in the 
prodemocracy movement

the most hotly contested mayors race in 
berkeley history continues without an official winner after a judge 
refused to rule monday on whether 386 latearriving absentee 
ballots should be counted 
presiding judge howard schwartz said he wanted to issue a 
written opinion later this week because his decision could call 
into question californias system for accepting absentee votes 
the alameda county superior court judge continued a temporary 
restraining order preventing the city clerk from declaring a 
winner 
mayor loni hancock is 77 votes ahead of former city councilman 
fred weekes according to all undisputed regular and absentee 
ballots counted friday from the dec 4 runoff the tally was 17641 
votes to 17564 
weekes who got 63 percent of some 7000 absentee ballots cast 
in the runoff wants the city clerk to also count the 386 mailin 
votes that were postmarked by dec 4 but received later 
absentee ballots typically favor conservative candidates both 
hancock and weekes are democrats but weekes is considered more 
conservative 
hancocks campaign contends that counting the latecomers would 
violate state election law which requires the clerk to count only 
those ballots that are in hand when the polls close 
but weekes and his attorneys claim the rules should be bent 
because the city clerk was lax in her duties by sending out 
absentee ballot forms too late as late as the friday before the 
election to allow timely return 
meanwhile hancock said she is considering seeking a recount of 
the nov 6 election that forced the runoff the mayor got 499 
percent of the vote falling just short of the 50 percent plus one 
vote needed to win the election outright

nearly half of the nations black children 
live in poverty and the youngest are the worst off a black 
research organization said monday 
the joint center for political and economic studies said black 
children under 3 tend to live in families headed by women in their 
20s who have never married and have few marriage or job prospects 
if current trends hold these children will be increasingly 
hard pressed to overcome the burdens imposed by poverty the 
center said growing numbers of them will not succeed 
cynthia rexroat a clemson university sociologist who is the 
author of the study said the youngest children are even more 
likely to be risk than are the older 
of all black children the study said 465 percent were in 
poverty in 1984 the study said 
ms rexroat said children younger than 3 in families headed by 
nevermarried women had the highest poverty rate of all 87 percent 
in 1984 compared with 76 percent in 1979 she said nearly 
twothirds of these women were in their 20s 
i would expect these trends would hold up as the 1990 census 
data become available she said 
belinda tucker acting director of the center for afroamerican 
studies at the university of california at los angeles said 
sociological projections indicate 30 percent of black women born in 
the early 1950s will never marry 
according to our research black americans value marriage as 
highly as any other ethnic group she said there is mounting 
evidence that limited employment prospects account for much of the 
decline in marriage 
she said increased homicide and crime rates among young black 
men were adding to the problem 
rationally why would any young woman marry a young man who 
stands a pretty good chance of either going to jail or being killed 
and has no job prospects anyway ms tucker asked 
james stewart vice provost and associate professor at 
pennsylvania state university said one of the factors that 
contributes to the stagnant status of nevermarried young women is 
the ineffectiveness of the schooling they have experienced over the 
last 15 years 
it is in part the decline in the quality of education and the 
ability to translate the education that they have into occupations 
that allow them t move out of poverty stewart said 
the study painted the economic picture for black americans as a 
study in contrasts 
on the one hand there is a growing middle class that has made 
great strides toward closing the gap between blacks and whites with 
respect to education employment and therefore economic resources 
and stability it said 
at the same time a growing segment of the black population is 
increasingly mired in poverty 
the study was discussed at a conference sponsored by the center 
which conducts research with the aim of improving the lot of black 
americans 
using data from the 1980 census ms rexroat concluded that the 
average black child who lives with a nevermarried mother will 
spend 15 childhood years in poverty 
the situation was brightest in the south where the poverty rate 
for black children declined from 43 to 37 percent between 1969 and 
1979 it rose only in atlanta birmingham ala and jacksonville 
fla among 25 southern cities studied 
the deepening of poverty for black children was most pronounced 
in the midwest where 37 percent of all black children relied on 
public assistance in 1984 this was nearly double the 20 percent 
figure of 1979 
in 20 metropolitan areas outside the south poverty increased 
among black children on an average of 30 percent to 35 percent from 
1969 to 1979 the study said it said the percentage on welfare 
increased by 11 points in milwaukee and cincinnati and by 10 points 
in buffalo 
the report called for comprehensive strategies and programs to 
improve the quality of education provide skills training for the 
jobs of the future and ensure equal access to employment 
opportunities

the un food and agriculture organization 
on monday appealed for 13 million tons of food for sudan where 
millions of people are threatened by famine 
a spokesman for western donor countries reported has offered 
help but sudans military government said it would accept food 
donations only if the junta is in charge of transportation and 
distribution 
estimates of the number of people at risk in africas largest 
nation vary from 3 million to 11 million in october the director 
of the us committee for refugees roger winter said sudan faces 
a famine of biblical dimensions 
the un agency said 1 million tons of food aid is needed to 
compensate for failure of the 199091 harvest because of drought 
conditions another 300000 tons is necessary to replenish food 
stocks at dangerously low levels after last years poor 
harvest 
in addition sudan will need fuel and other support to 
distribute the food agency said in a news release distributed in 
nairobi 
the sudanese government acknowledges a food gap of about 1 
million tons of grain 
the united states has criticized the government for alleged 
attacks on grain stocks to keep them from areas controlled by 
southern rebels 
in previous relief operations for southern sudan western donors 
and the united nations have insisted on at least partial 
involvement in transportation and distribution to make sure the aid 
gets to the affected people 
the un agencys appeal based on a recent crop assessment 
throughout sudan is the latest in a string of calls for help for 
the northeast african nation of more than 25 million people 
on sunday sudans military strongman lt gen omar hassan 
elbashir met in the capital of khartoum with british ambassador 
allen ramsey who was representing western donor countries 
the official sudan news agency quoted ramsey on monday as 
expressing western willingness to provide food for famine victims

the soviet union which has stood with the united 
states in the fivemonth drive to get iraq out of kuwait on monday 
backed the tough stand taken by secretary of state jmes a baker 
iii on holding talks in baghdad 
the endorsement came from soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze at a meeting in houston with baker on the persian gulf 
situation 
baker has rejected an iraqi proposal that he go to baghdad on 
jan 12 only three days before the deadline set by the un 
security council for iraq to quit kuwait or face a forcible 
eviction 
baker said sunday he wont be a party to playing games that 
back us up to that deadline 
he proposed going to baghdad to see president saddam hussein 
either dec 20 21 or 22 or on jan 3 
at bakers houston meeting with shevardnadze a senior soviet 
official said the foreign minister reiterated his support his 
understanding of that schedule 
the soviets do not plan to send an emissary to baghdad for the 
time being the soviet official said the top soviet expert on 
the persian gulf yevgeny primakov has made two previous trips to 
the iraqi capital for talks with saddam hussein 
this official spoke to reporters after the bakershevardnadze 
meeting on condition that he not be identified a us official 
also briefed reporters on the same condition 
the us official said the iraqi government had not responded to 
bakers rejection of the jan 12 proposal though iraqs ambassador 
has said there should be no problem in arranging a suitable date 
for baker to visit baghdad 
shevardnadzes support and deferral of any new soviet overtures 
to saddam hussein strengthens the united stand taken by the two 
superpowers against iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
bakers trip could be the last opportunity for iraq to yield to 
international demands for a pullout before facing an attack

the bush administration on monday cautioned 
against counting iraqs release of foreign hostages as a step away 
from the brink of war 
in a speech clearly aimed at limiting saddam husseins publicity 
gains from the hostage release defense secretary dick cheney 
called the iraqi president the worlds alltime hostage taker 
and said the military threat is growing 
cheney mentioned no specific numbers of iraqi forces in kuwait 
but a pentagon source citing us intelligence reports later said 
that iraqi troops in and around kuwait have grown beyond the 
480000 detected in the area last week the source who discussed 
the matter on condition he not be identified indicated that the 
iraqi occupation force is now at or near 500000 
president bush speaking at a ceremony proclaiming monday as 
human rights day lashed out at saddam for inhumane treatment of 
the kuwaitis and their nation 
the eyewitness accounts that i have heard from kuwaiti 
citizens are a catalog of human misery looting torture rape 
summary execution acts of unspeakable cruelty bush said what 
has happened to kuwait is more than an invasion it is a systematic 
assault on the soul of a nation 
cheney spoke shortly after a chartered pan am jet carrying 152 
american and four canadian former hostages lifted off from 
frankfurt germany en route to andrews air force base md saddam 
has promised the release of about 8000 american european and 
japanese citizens who had been forbidden from leaving kuwait and 
iraq 
in other developments soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze expressed support for the refusal of secretary of 
state james a baker to agree to go to baghdad on jan 12 three 
days before the united nations deadline for the evacuation of 
kuwait officials at the bakershevardnadze meeting in houston said 
shevardnadze agreed with bakers proposal of dec 20 21 or 22 or 
jan 3 
a new poll showed support among americans for president bushs 
persian gulf policy little changed from what it was a week ago 62 
percent vs 61 percent the poll of 518 americans by telephone on 
sunday taken by abc news said 61 percent expect war with iraq down 
14 points in the wake of the release of hostages by iraq 
the poll has a likely margin of uincertainy of 5 percentage 
points eight way abc said 
in these past few days as he has released hostages he has 
simultaneously continued to build up his deployments in kuwait to 
enhance his fortifications and to add additional forces to the 
region cheney told a defense industry conference 
the pentagon announced last week that iraq had added 30000 
troops in kuwait and southern iraq bringing the total to 480000 
cheney said the united states has 250000 troops in the region 
along with 200000 from allied nations 
on capitol hill congressional officials said the administration 
would soon ask congress for 12 billion to 20 billion to help pay 
the costs of operation desert shield the extra money is needed to 
pay for the estimated 200000 reinforcements that president bush 
ordered to the gulf on nov 8 a move bush said would give the 
united states an offensive military option against iraq 
the request would meet most expenses of the gulf operation for 
the current budget year but the extra money would not cover the 
cost of a war with iraq officials indicated 
a senior pentagon official confirmed that the added costs of 
desert shield in 1991 would be as much as 20 billion and he said 
the administration expected to receive additional financial 
contributions from allies who have already committed more than 7 
billion 
the official said saudi arabia and some other gulf nations had 
made openended commitments at the start of desert shield in august 
to help underwrite the operation he said it was unclear how much 
of the added cost would be covered by the gulf nations and other 
allies such as japan and germany 
during a trip to europe last week cheney told reporters he had 
asked nato allies for additional unspecified contributions but it 
appeared that his request was mainly for military rather than 
financial assistance 
in his speech to the american defense preparedness association 
cheney said the public should not view iraqs mass release of 
hostages as a sign that saddam is backing away from his campaign to 
crush the life out of kuwait 
he has given us absolutely no indication whatsoever of any 
intention of complying with the un resolutions requiring that 
iraq withdraw its armed forces from kuwait and allow the return of 
the exiled kuwaiti monarchy cheney said 
in spelling out the administrations reasons for committing 
american troops to the gulf and threatening to use them against 
iraq cheney put special emphasis on the global economic interests 
at stake 
there is no naysaying the fact that one of the major concerns 
we have is the very real possibility that should saddam hussein 
succeed in his aggression should he be allowed to keep kuwait 
that he would be in a position to directly control over 20 percent 
of the worlds proven oil reserve cheney said 
cheney said that unlike saudi arabia and kuwait who have used 
most of their oil revenues in recent years to modernize their 
economies iraq used 50 billion over a 10year span to build the 
worlds sixthlargest army and to pursue weapons of mass 
destruction including chemical biological and nuclear arms 
he also cited as part of the rationale for challenging saddam in 
kuwait the very real threat to the continued existence of the 
state of israel posed by the iraq military 
the defense secretary also said a longstanding us commitment 
to preserving the independence of saudi arabia and other gulf 
states is at the heart of this

in continuing hindumoslem clashes that have left at least 118

rampaging mobs of hindus and moslems who defied the curfew and took 
to the streets said officials who cannot be identified under

others were injured in knife fights 
in addition to the 10 people who were killed monday three 
others died of stab wounds sustained earlier the officials said

of aligarh and kanpur and in ahmedabad in the west at least 40 
people have been killed in the last three days in aligarh 250 
miles west of ayodhya news reports said 
the hyderabad riots are the worst single outbreak of sectarian 
violence in india since the ayodhya campaign started in october at 
least 380 people were killed in nationwide hindumoslem riots in 
october and november 
hindu fundamentalists claim that ayodhyas 16th century babri 
masjid or mosque of babar was built on the ruins of a temple they 
believe was destroyed by moslem conquerers moslems say the mosque 
was built on a vacant plot archeologists and historians are 
divided on the issue 
meanwhile prime minister chandra shekhar has been meeting hindu 
and moslem leaders in an effort to find a solution to the dispute 
which brought down the government of his predecessor vp singh 
last month 
singhs minority government fell when a hindu revivalist party 
withdrew support to protest his policy of not allowing the mosque 
to be demolished 
moslems account for 12 percent of indias 880 million people 
while hindus comprise 82 percent

66 percent who thought that way a week ago

of the crisis with 62 percent supporting his efforts compared with 
61 percent last week 
also relatively unchanged was the 65 percent compared to 67 
percent last week who support the united states taking all 
action necessary including the use of military force to make 
sure iraq withdraws from kuwait

settlement being linked to israels occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip

more months behind bars if she refuses to testify at a murder 
trial a district attorney said monday

refuses to testify 
if shes willing to pay that price she may have to pay it

ms averyt last month because they contain information arnold did 
not reveal to police 
defense attorneys dont want the articles admitted although if 
they are allowed they want ms averyt to testify about the content 
of her interviews 
jones says her testimony could help him in his pursuit of the 
death penalty during the punishment phase of the trial if arnold 
is convicted 
there was no agreement between the reporter and the defendant 
that parts of the interview not be printed jones said 
the prosecutor said ms averyt should be made to testify about

the texas constitution she was jailed friday

maintained that journalists should not be compelled to reveal 
information obtained from news sources if that information was not

jewelry store clerk christina sanchez 
in the articles arnold says he shot ms sanchez and describes

a summary of developments in the news industry for the week of 
dec 310 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
both sides in the daily news strike said they 
hoped a federal mediator could help end the bitter 6weekold 
walkout meanwhile the newspaper has started an afternoon edition 
and filed lawsuits against those it claims have fed strikerelated 
violence 
bernard d delury director of the federal mediation and 
conciliation service called the newspaper and its nine striking 
unions dec 7 to suggest a meeting in washington 
we consider this a step forward in the negotiation process and 
are hopeful that a swift resolution of the strike will be 
possible said news vice president john sloan weve agreed to 
fully cooperate 
theodore w kheel a lawyer advising the unions called the 
offer the last clear chance for a settlement 
sloan said delury wanted separate meetings with management and 
the unions but george mcdonald president of the allied printing 
trades council an umbrella group for the striking unions said a 
joint meeting would be necessary 
union leaders say they fear that the tribune co of chicago 
which owns the news would soon close the paper if the mediation 
attempt fails 
sloan said the parent company would review the daily news 
situation during a board meeting dec 11 but said he was confident 
the tribune co would continue to support the paper 
city police and the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms have been investigating allegations of bombings and arson 
for several weeks us attorney andrew j maloney said 
maloney said the inquiry was started at the request of the 
newspaper 
there have been a number of fires and uses of explosive 
devices in the strike he said 
publisher james hoge has been critical of the citys response to 
attacks on replacement drivers on dec 6 he accused new yorks 
mayor and police of ignoring evidence the strikers conspired to 
destroy the newspaper with violence and intimidation 
hoge was angry that a replacement driver was beaten and stabbed 
about 12 hours after the driver was summoned to testify before a 
grand jury investigating strike violence 
i submit that the police need to face up to what is clearly 
the reality today in this community the gangsters are running 
free and nobody is willing to say what is really occurring hoge 
said at a news conference 
the newspaper offered a 100000 reward for information about an 
attack early dec 6 in irvington nj on the replacement driver 
carlos chacon 
police said 15 men armed with baseball bats bottles and a knife 
attacked chacon who was hospitalized afterward 
hoge stopped short of saying the grand jury summons and the 
stabbing were directly linked 
chacon was called as a potential witness for an investigation 
into an oct 27 incident in which a striking daily news driver 
allegedly smashed a delivery trucks headlights and windows hoge 
said 
among those the newspaper has sued in connection with 
strikerelated violence was joseph martin a truck driver for the 
new york times who allegedly smashed his truck into a news vehicle 
on nov 3 
the lawsuit alleged the replacement driver suffered severe 
injuries in a subsequent assault by martin 
kheel called the lawsuits unfounded and said the unions will 
challenge them 
on dec 4 the newspaper launched its first afternoon edition in 
nine years 
street hawkers distributed 30000 copies of the initial press 
run the tabloid had blue ink printed across the top and bottom of 
the front page to distinguish it from morning editions 
using management replacement workers and employees who crossed 
the picket line the news has published every day during the 
strike but circulation the nations thirdhighest at 109 
million before the strike has dropped by more than half 
the circulation drop has cost the paper many major advertisers 
the news said it expects to lose up to 35 million this quarter and 
about 85 million for the year thats on top of losses of 115 
million from 1979 through 1989

the associated press and the wire service guild 
reached tentative agreement on a twoyear contract covering more 
than 1300 employees nationwide 
the agreement which would replace a contract that expired nov 
30 provides for raises of 28 percent in the first year and 23 
percent in the second 
i think its a realistic contract and i think that given the 
economic climate in the industry and its obvious impact on us 
thats what makes it realistic d byron yake ap director of 
human resources said dec 5 
the other side of that is that were pleased we can offer a 
contract that has raises and not freezes and cuts 
kevin keane guild president said obviously the bargaining 
committee is disappointed with the size of the wage increase but 
they worked hard and were convinced that this is the best 
contract we can get given the labor and economic climate 
he said the guild was recommending ratification by the 
membership 
the contract calls for pay increases that would raise top scale 
for newspersons and photographers from 720 to 740 weekly in the 
first year of the contract and from 740 to 757 in the second 
year 
economic differentials also would go up in the second year of 
the contract news staff employees in new york and washington would 
receive a 10 a week increase in the differential bringing it to 
97 the differential in los angeles san francisco boston and 
chicago would go up 15 to 60 
the contract also offers improved retirement benefits for those 
already retired and service credits for active participants in the 
pension plan 
the tentative pact cuts paid maternity leave for women from four 
weeks to one week while keeping one week paid paternity leave for 
men and changes unpaid leave time from 18 months to 12 months for 
both men and women 
under the old contract men were not given unpaid paternity 
leave 
in addition women on maternity leave will be allowed to use 
eight weeks fullpay disability regardless of their length of 
employment

two men whose father was killed by a man 
hired through an ad in soldier of fortune won a 124 million 
judgment against the magazine on dec 7 
michael and ian braun claimed that a business associate of their 
father saw a classified ad in the magazine placed by richard savage 
of knoxville tenn and then arranged to have savage kill their 
father richard braun 
savages classified ad read gun for hire 37yearold 
professional mercenary desires jobs vietnam veteran discrete and 
very private body guard courier and other special skills all 
jobs considered 
the magazine stopped running such ads in 1986 
the business associate bruce gastwirth savage and two others 
were convicted of brauns killing savage already had been 
convicted in a similar murderforhire case in west palm beach 
fla as well as several attempted assassinations that went awry 
a braun family attorney steve glassroth said soldier of 
fortune should have been aware of news stories about a series of 
unrelated crimes in the early 1980s tied to its classified ads 
those stories should have stopped the magazine from running the 
personal services ads long before 1986 he said 
robert brown the magazines founder and publisher denied 
seeing any of those stories he said he ran the ads to help vietnam 
veterans find jobs using their military skills 
defense attorney jim garrett argued that a publisher has no duty 
to investigate every advertiser but he said if the magazine had 
checked savage it would have found he served in vietnam and was a 
courier under gen william westmoreland

western products and ideas 
in the meantime publishing ventures face nothing but problems 
in the short term in getting into the soviet union 
paper is in short supply printing operations are not up to 
western standards distribution systems are questionable the 
soviet ruble cannot yet be converted into other currencies 
but melvin said the soviet union is a powerful lure to 
publishers with its 300 million consumers who have been 
economically isolated for years 
they have a great desire for the printed word virtually every 
magazine that is printed is gobbled up melvin said 
publishers who get in now will be ready to give advertisers a 
way to reach those readers once their products become available

american john hull sought in 
neighboring costa rica in connection with a 1984 news conference 
bombing that killed three journalists has been living in nicaragua 
since october a newspaper reported 
barricada the official daily of the sandinista national 
liberation front reported that hull is trying to set up a business 
with former contra rebel leaders 
while in costa rica he owned a farm and landing strip used to 
supply the contras he has been implicated in the may 1984 
assassination attempt on nicaraguan rebel leader eden pastora 
during a news conference 
a bomb carried into pastoras jungle headquarters wounded 
pastora and about a dozen reporters and killed american reporter 
linda frazier and two costa rican journalists 
prosecutor jorge chavarria earlier said hull and felipe vidal a 
cuban planned the bombing to avenge pastoras statements linking 
hull to the cia hull denies the charges

as president bush was telling south 
americans dec 3 to push for free trade and open up their 
economies hundreds of us journalists covered him using equipment 
that technically could have been seized by brazils federal 
police 
a special press room set up in brasilia by the us embassy was 
a glaring contrast to the restrictions barriers and bureaucracy 
that inhibit the use of uptodate conveniences in brazil and much 
of south america 
american reporters wrote their bush stories on lightweight 
laptop computers they filed them on portable fax machines or over 
highspeed data channels using special telephone lines connected 
directly to the united states american broadcast networks thanks 
to a huge imported dish antenna set up in the hotel parking lot 
beamed reports directly to us satellites 
brazil made a special exception for the washington press but 
under normal circumstances here computers and faxes and highspeed 
communications equipment are on a list of totally prohibited 
imports 
the idea behind the law was to prevent foreign imperialists 
from controlling brazils sophisticated technology many other 
south american countries have similar restrictions to protect their 
hightech industries 
brazil has a 6 billionayear market in computers and related 
equipment though the equipment costs far more than outside the 
country 
a year ago a brazilian fax cost 8000 now one might be found 
discounted to 1500 but most remain in the 25003000 range 
in the united states they cost less than 500 
a 14inch color monitor for a home computer made in brazil and 
thus for sale legally costs 2800 the us price is 650 
brazils topoftheline laser printer costs 20000 a us 
model with the same features sells for 3500

the canadian broadcasting corp said dec 5 it was 
eliminating 1100 jobs and cutting newscasts and other programming 
to save 108 million 
the shortfall is due to government funding cuts inflation 
declining television advertising and such other costs as new taxes 
and pension funding said cbc president gerard veilleux 
the cuts represent just under 10 percent of cbcs 12 billion 
annual budget about 900 million of that comes from government and 
the rest from ad revenue cbc employs about 10000 people and the 
layoffs are its worst ever 
veilleux said at a news conference that the cuts go into effect 
april 1 but some effects will be felt immediately 
these decisions have given me many sleepless nights he told 
cbc employees during a closedcircuit televised announcement i 
can only trust were doing the right thing 
as part of the cuts the cbc has decided it can no longer afford 
the 20 million annual cost to run radio canada international the 
international shortwave radio service or the 45million cost of 
the english and french parliamentary channels which broadcast 
house of commons proceedings cbc will ask the government to pick 
up the tab for tese operations 
in addition english and french radio network budgets will be 
cut by 1 percent the following year 2 percent will be trimmed 
from their budgets 
newsworld cbcs allnews cable channel is not supposed to be 
affected however many of its news items originate at regional 
stations that will be closed

the fbi investigation into who leaked tapes of 
manuel noriegas prison phone calls focuses on a political opponent 
who might testify against the deposed panamanian dictator 
newspapers reported 
the fbi believes the source of the leak appears to be jose 
blandon once an intelligence officer in panama for noriega and the 
countrys former consul general in new york the miami herald and 
the washington post reported quoting unidentified sources 
blandon denied leaking the government tapes in an interview 
published dec 9 in the post blandon said someone in the us 
government who wants to sabotage the noriega trial must have been 
responsible 
somebody in the government was leaking them blandon said 
drug enforcement agents were present whenever he had access to the 
tapes and he was allowed to make only written notes blandon said 
the fbi is trying to determine who gave the tapes to cable news 
network which aired some of noriegas conversations from prison 
over the past month the broadcasts were halted briefly while a 
federal judge decided whether noriegas right to a fair trial would 
be jeopardized after reviewing the tapes the judge decided to let 
cnn broadcast them 
in a related matter the justice department is refusing to 
return documents belonging to a cnn reporter saying they may be 
evidence in an investigation of the leaked recordings 
the justice department filed a brief dec 3 with the us 
district court in atlanta opposing a motion by cnn for return of 
the documents 
the materials were in a box taken from a hotel room that 
reporter marlene fernandez had been staying in the fbi confiscated 
the box after hotel officials apparently thinking fernandez had 
checked out reported it as abandoned property 
the justice department said it kept 15 documents and returned 
all the other items in the box to cnn including 52 documents and 
five videotape cassettes labeled noriega tapes 
in another development the network said dec 5 it was dropping 
its fight to prevent the release of court transcripts of the 
noriega tapes 
us district judge william hoeveler ruling in favor of four 
news organizations that demanded access to the transcripts had 
said they would be released unless cnn appealed 
cnns main concern in opposing unsealing of the transcripts 
has been to protect the integrity of agreements with sources cnn 
spokesman steve haworth said 
but after reviewing the transcripts network officials decided 
there was little danger of compromising those sources he said 
the organizations seeking the transcripts were the miami herald 
the associated press postnewsweek station wplgtv of miami and 
gannett co inc and its usa today they argued that the public has 
a right to examine the content of the tapes which were at the 
center of a freedomofthepress dispute

he wants to create a global news network to counter the spread of 
cable news network to dozens of countries 
i dont mean to badmouth mr turner but cnn is trying to 
force us news on the rest of the world nhk chairman keiji 
shima said dec 3 referring to cnn head ted turner 
uder shimas plan broadcasters from asia europe and north 
america would be responsible for eighthour daily segments focusing 
on their own region 
shima said he believed asians should cover issues about asia 
but he did not give a detailed explanation why he also said there 
was not enough news about the region being broadcast to other parts 
of the globe 
shima in a speech to foreign reporters acknowledged that the 
british broadcasting corp has shown little interest in his 
proposal but he said other major broadcasters have expressed 
interest 
he did not identify those broadcasters however and an nhk 
spokeswoman said the names could not be released because 
negotiations were under way 
shima provided no concrete details of his plan but said he 
hoped such a network could be set up in about six months 
nhk has two channels on japanese television one with general 
programming and the other featuring educational fare it also has 
two stations for satellite broadcasting the programming on those 
stations includes news broadcasts from several countries

network said dec 5 
the network said the columbia woman actually saw the first part 
of taped promotions for geraldo riveras syndicated talk show that 
were supposed to appear only on wcbstv in new york 
there was a small technical problem in the way our network 
computers switch to local stations the network said 
then alluding to the accidental transmission of the geraldo 
promotions on the network it said 
occasionally a fraction of a second of another feed will air 
in this case it was a promo for an upcoming show to air on wcbstv 
in new york we are taking steps to correct this problem 
the brief appearance of the promotional announcements 
accidentally went out on the network during the pauses it puts in 
the guiding light daytime soap opera for local commercials 
aired by affiliates the executive said 
the goof came to light because of the sharp eyes of viewer julie 
moore 
she said that while looking at episodes of the soap opera she 
taped last week she spotted the word adultery in large type 
imposed over the cbs logo during a commercial break the words 
shock therapy appeared in the same way in the tape of the next 
days show

the called play was inadvertent but added a big part of our

when politicians look at the mood of the 
nation they tend to see their own reflections thats why hawks 
and doves are reading opposite messages about the persian gulf 
crisis from the people back home 
there are public opinion polls for guidance but in the debate 
about the us course toward iraq those surveys are counted or 
discounted depending on what the numbers show and whos talking 
about them 
president bush has said again and again that he is not going to 
make decisions because of poll ratings high or low were not 
going to run the foreign policy of this country on the basis of 
polls secretary of state james a baker iii repeated at 
congressional hearings on the desert shield confrontation 
but the backing the polls measure is vital to the administration 
course in seeking to force iraq out of kuwait 
so when senate republicans pointed to a survey that showed solid 
support for the course approved by the united nations security 
council threatening military action unless iraq withdraws by jan 
15 baker welcomed the evidence that the policy seems to enjoy 
the support of the american people 
sen richard g lugar rind said the poll makes it baffling 
that critics of the hardline bush policy are purporting to 
represent a majority of american opinion 
that prompted advocates of a more cautious course to tell baker 
that he shouldnt do what he said he wasnt going to do lets 
not make the decision of whether or not to go on the offensive on 
the basis of a poll or any number of polls said sen paul simon 
dill 
the poll that counted of course was the one on nov 6 the 
congressional elections but that was two days before bush 
announced that he was doubling the american troop deployment 
against iraq to provide an offensive capability if thats what it 
takes to get saddam husseins forces out of kuwait 
that move became the dividing line in the policy debate until 
it was made bush faced no significant dissent on the use of 
international economic sanctions against iraq and the use of us 
forces to defend saudi arabia against any further iraqi advance 
policy critics now say the administration should wait longer 
perhaps 12 to 18 months for the sanctions to take their full toll 
bush baker and defense secretary dick cheney now say they doubt 
the sanctions will force saddam to quit kuwait while there has 
been no decision to take offensive action the administration says 
that must be one of the options and a realistic one to force 
iraqi withdrawal 
each side says the course it advocates is the best way to gain 
us objectives without war 
that debate was not part of the 1990 campaign although the 
administrations decision to increase troop strength was made 
before the elections i would say the key decisionmaking time 
was late october cheney said 
the concern was not an effort to hide the decision but 
rather that if we announced something relating to desert shield 
before the election we would be accused of trying to manipulate the 
foreign policy considerations to influence the elections cheney 
told the senate armed services committee on dec 3 
that accusation would almost certainly have been raised i 
understand that said sen albert gore jr dtenn but it also 
says something about the way in which the american people and their 
elected representatives are brought into the decisionmaking 
process 
gore insists that there should be a congressional declaration of 
war in advance of any offensive action if the votes arent there 
to declare war that is the best indication well ever have that 
the american people do not want war he said to go ahead 
anyhow would risk the kind of domestic division that occurred 
during vietnam 
other members of congress say the message theyre getting from 
their constituents is one of caution no matter what the polls 
report sen claiborne pell dri said his mail and telephone 
calls run 8 or 9 to one urging the administration to slow down 
rep lee h hamilton dind said constituents are telling him the 
same thing because they do not want the united states to get into 
a war 
the question neither side can answer is whether waiting out the 
sanctions or adding the threat of a military strike is the course 
most likely to settle the kuwait crisis short of war

back in 1946 director frank capra came up with 
its a wonderful life a wonderful film starring jimmy stewart 
it has become a christmas favorite on television at least the 
uncolorized version 
now comes clarence a gentle at times slyly funny 
computerage variation of life that cable televisions the 
family channel is showing tonight and again friday and sunday 
it stars robert carradine as clarence oddbody the gentle angel 
who in capras film descended to earth to gently persuade the 
decent despairing george bailey that his life was not as worthless 
as he thought 
there are a few changes in the new film of course in capras 
movie clarence played by henry travers was a genial old duffer 
who landed in a small town 
carradines clarence who has gotten much younger in heaven 
since his fine work 44 years earlier lands in a busy noisy big 
city hed prefer to stay where he is working on clocks 
he has agreed to go only because a a fellow angels family is 
in trouble b the angels widow may commit suicide and c 
theres a shortage of guardian angels what with the world in the 
shape it is 
the fellow angel richard fitzpatrick was a computer whiz who 
died suddenly before he could perfect dexter a revolutionary 
voiceactivated computer cartoon toy for kids 
unlike other kids computer games which have considerable 
violence and all sorts of warlike trolls stomping on each other 
his would have emphasized kindness decency and even education 
now his widow rachel played by kate trotter must keep their 
struggling company going perfect her late husbands invention and 
fend off an evil mogul louis del grande with a soul of garlic he 
wants to buy their firm and use its technology to create even more 
violent computer games for kids 
at the same time she must care for their two kids brent 
nicolas van burek a sullen teenage computer ace and casey 
jamie rainey a sweet but very sharp little girl 
clarence bumbles hisway into their lives after he lands on 
earth and is immediately accosted by a panhandler shaking a tin cup 
at him he takes a coin from the cup telling the startled beggar 
thank you 
its one of the many lowkey but funny little scenes that dot 
the film 
another has little casey immediately suspecting the visitor of 
being from elsewhere than planet earth consulting her childs book 
of magical beings she rules out the possibility he is an elf 
a griffin or a phoenix she learns that every time a bell rings an 
angel gets its wings 
sneaking up on him she shakes a toy donkey with a bell around 
its neck no wings she tries again still no wings he looks 
quizzically at her as she asks in her tiny voice doesnt this do 
anything for you 
constantly monitored by a teenage recording angel and forbidden 
to reveal his identity on pain of being stuck on earth clarence 
faces a succession of crises including a big one directly 
concerning him 
he also has to cope with moments of sadness and high anxiety 
not to mention true villainy by the evil mogul that almost drives 
the widow rachel to suicide 
alas suspense is absent you always have the feeling that 
decency will win out and because the story unfolds at 
christmastime that therell even be a happy ending 
lesser problems are that some of the scenes in the shows last 
half are a little strained and a brief reunion in heaven goes on a 
tad too long 
but clarence generally overcomes all this and with warmth 
and humor the cause is aided by fine acting by all hands deft 
direction by eric till and a warm generally wellcrafted script by 
lorne cameron and david hoselton 
the show doesnt match the rambunctiousness the great highs and 
lows of its a wonderful life but its a solid effort one the 
family will enjoy and only a grinch could put the knock on it 
 
elsewhere in television 
once more and stay in key please this being yuletide cbs 
this morning says that on friday it will start airing a holiday 
medley specifically oh what a beautiful morning and jingle 
bells the music is to be played by the cbs morning symphony 
paula zahn a classical cellist charles osgood an accomplished 
pianist harry smith a lapsed tubist and dr bob arnot on 
trumpet more or less mark mcewen and victoria corderi are to play 
bells

few are the economic commentators who havent 
agreed by now that the economy is in recession why hold out with 
layoffs rising retailers forced to cut prices housing and car 
sales down banks in trouble 
but some people not only wont use the r word treating it 
as they would a publicly unutterable reference and most of them 
are associated with the us government and the white house 
judging from their statements they prefer euphemisms to 
president bush the economy is in a serious slowdown alan 
greenspan the federal reserve chairman prefers meaningful 
downturn 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers had called the downturn a lull but in commenting 
late last week on the big jump in november unemployment he 
elaborated on his view to wit 
the decline in employment in november and the large revision 
in the job decline in october confirm that the economy is 
contracting noticeably in the fourth quarter 
in contrast independent assessors of economic activity have 
been using the r word for weeks or months openly blatantly 
boldly for obvious reasons preferring not to wait for the 
semiofficial definition 
the obviousness of their impatience is that the definition 
relied on by historians and the government two straight quarters 
of shrinking gross national product isnt available until about 
seven months into recession 
moreover what seems to be a growing number of economic analysts 
dont give a hoot for the formal decalaration 
says economist robert barbera of shearson lehman brothers for 
our part we continue to believe that the united states is in the 
fifth month of a recession that will extend into the middle of next 
year 
and albert sindlinger of sindlinger amp co whose staff 
telephones about 4000 households a month to inquire into their 
financial affairs finds most people believe the economy has been 
in recession all year long 
the question of recession yes or no was decided long ago at 
the national association of realtors which forecast that the 
economy will remain in a recession through much of 1991 with 
sustained growth resuming in 1992 
there are perhaps good reasons why government officials shy from 
the word one being that to declare a recession exists might 
exacerbate the situation another is that what the government says 
is not easily retracted 
but government has demonstrated in other economic areas a 
similar verbal dexterity in the avoidance of unpleasant terms 
the recent federal budget agreement for example was said to 
include a fiveyear 500 billion deficit reduction partly the 
result of spending cuts but many independent analysts claim they 
can find little sign of reduction 
believe me when the fat lady sings the 1991 deficit will be 
higher than it was in 1990 says james c miller cochairman of 
the tax foundation 
miller who learned a bit about deficits as president reagans 
budget director says the main reason is that spending will go up 
by at least 100 billion more than the entire federal government 
spent as late as 1961 
while a deficitreduction package that raises deficits might 
be seen as an astonishing miscommunication some commentators 
believe a recession that isnt called one until after its over is 
being less than forthright 
there is nothing sacred about the semiofficial definition of 
recession why for instance does it take two straight quarters of 
economic shrinkage isnt a year when there are two poor 
quarters though not consecutive just as painful asks 
investment adviser john dessauer 
meanwhile there is a chance the current downturn might already 
fit one of the broader definitions of recession offered by 
greenspan 
a recession he said is a process of deterioration in which 
events feed on each other to induce economy into a cumulative 
decline

editors note artificial life sounds like a contradiction 
but the notion that lifelike behavior can be coaxed out of 
nonliving material is gaining acceptance among scientists some

its a dogeatdog world inside danny hillis computer home to 
64000 competing programs only the fittest will survive 
fitness in this 5foot universe is the ability to sort letters 
alphabetically but hillis its creator doesnt teach his programs 
how to sort instead he sets up a world in which programs with 
sorting ability are more likely to survive then he waits 
the early programs are terrible sorters the worst are killed 
off right away some put a before z by blind luck but thats 
good enough they mate merging successful traits in 
offspring that do better still 
evolution proceeds at a dizzying pace the result after 10000 
generations a better program for alphabetical sorting than 
anything i could write says hillis a programmer with a 
doctorate from massachusetts institute of technology 
there can be no doubt the software that evolved in hillis 
computer is superior to anything a human could produce 
the question is is it alive 
probably not or as hillis is apt to answer not yet but to 
him and other scientists on the frontier known as artificial life 
its only a matter of time before life becomes literally what 
we make of it 
artificial life like artificial intelligence is an attempt to 
coax lifelike behavior from nonliving material silicon 
chemicals even legos 
alifers biologists chemists physicists mathematicians 
and computer scientists envision a notsodistant future 
inhabited by evolving software sentient robots and life forms 
based on chemicals other than carbon 
we are all going to be living in a world filled with 
artificial life forms we havent yet imagined says ucla 
biologist charles taylor 
christopher langton of the los alamos national laboratory in new 
mexico predicts artificial life will emerge on its own 
spontaneously surfacing within complex computer networks just as 
the first biological life did on earth 3 billion years ago 
his colleague physicist j doyne farmer goes even further 
artificial life could surpass its creators ultimately occupying 
the next rung on the evolutionary ladder 
the prospect unleashes primal fears of humanitys creations 
growing out of control culminating in our destruction researchers 
acknowledge the fear some even profess to share it but say the 
scientists role is to press on and hope for the best humans 
have a way of muddling through says john h holland an engineer 
and computer scientist at the university of michigan i suspect 
well find ways to keep ourselves safe 
despite the science fiction overtones artificial life research 
focuses on furthering understanding of biological life and much of 
it rests on a bedrock of scientific fact 
scientists used to think that the origin of life was a unique 
event just this bolt of lightning just that temperature 
langton says 
how life began remains a mystery but the notion of life as a 
natural proess as opposed to a freak accident is among the tenets 
of modern biology 
while no one knows how the first living cell was formed the 
complexity of even the simplest bacteria points to a long series of 
small distinct steps picture a boeing 747 spontaneously 
assembling in a tornadotorn scrap yard that says british 
astronomer sir fred hoyle is about as likely as a living cell 
coming together in a single shot 
the steps required mandate that life was no accident a 
multistep process that relies on one improbable event following 
upon the other is bound to abort sooner or later nobel laureate 
christian de duve of the rockefeller university wrote recently 
the assumption that life is defined by the organization and 
interaction of its parts rather than the material its made of lies 
at the heart of artificial life research 
the first cell was composed of carbonbased polymers as are we 
all but not because the stuff has mystical properties you can 
find the material were made of all around says physicist howard 
pattee of the state university of new york at binghamton we were 
made from whatever was handy 
the material is immaterial says langton to whom building 
life isnt so different from building say a computer 
you can build a computer out of tubes carrying water 
electronic chips or even tinkertoys whats important is that you 
have the right functions related in the right way some of us think 
thats also true of life 
then why dont we see new forms springing up all the time 
other life either outcompetes it eats it or erases its base of 
support langton says 
but concoct the right blend of materials in a controlled 
environment he says and life will emerge biologists believe 
selforganization is a natural property of matter though the 
process by which it occurs is another mystery 
we believe the chemical soup on earth when left alone for 
millions of years sprouted flowers and frogs and people hillis 
says yet the rules of chemistry are pretty simple its hard to 
believe something that simple could produce something as 
complicated as a person 
understanding how simple rules give rise to complex behavior is 
the holy grail of artificial life research for therein lies the 
key to all life scientists theorize already they are fashioning 
complex worlds based on simple rules within the finite universe of 
computers seeking new insights into ageold questions some are 
using chemicals to model emergent properties others are building 
mechanical representations 
the questions they hope to answer are formidable what is life 
when does it begin what factors speed evolution natural selection 
ensures that species improve from one generation to the next but 
what process makes individuals improve how does adaptation in one 
species affect another if this years frog develops a sticky 
tongue what does that do to next years fly 
not the least of the questions concerns humanitys future we 
tend to assume evolution stops with us clearly thats not the 
case langton says so far compared to ancient creatures 
were just a flash in the pan 
what does artificial life portend for humans we may be the 
first species to create its own successors farmer says 
rest assured however creatures unveiled at an artificial life 
conference in new mexico last winter posed no imminent threat 
electronic ants negotiated a computergenerated maze in a 
system called genesys created by david jefferson and charles 
taylor of ucla each ant was composed of strands of computer code 
genes that determined its ability to move in various 
directions the gens of the first ants were randomly generated 
and most quickly died the fittest survived to pass their superior 
genes on to offspring and so on as with hillis alphabetsorting 
programs performance improved as evolution progressed

programs like genesys show it is possible to evolve seemingly 
intelligent behavior quickly and easily on a computer taylor 
says computers also enable scientists to manipulate population 
size mutation rates and other factors to see what works best 
from various evolving worlds theories emerge parasites spark 
diversity through adaptation predators do well initially but 
cooperators win in the end small may have an edge over large 
adversity is good its hard to develop an advantage in an 
unchanging environment says physicist richard bagley of los 
alamos 
computer worlds will be a snap to create with software being 
developed at los alamos simulated environments with readymade 
populations programmed to move in various ways amaze your friends 
simulate fish ants molecules preschoolers the same basic 
architecture underlies almost all biology lots of pieces that 
interact with each other langton says 
models are expected to quickly become more sophisticated but 
already complex behavior is busting out all over 
squirt is a cubicinch robot built by rodney brooks of mits 
robotics lab using a few basic rules separately the rules are 
innocuous together they add up to a robot with an attitude 
one rule concerns light squirt doesnt like it turn on a 
light and the robot goes into a spiral search pattern until its 
safely in darkness 
should its microphones detect sound followed by a long period of 
silence squirt is designed to temporarily override its fear of 
light and head toward the sound the fear then returns 
seldom seen by its lab mates squirt spends most of its time 
sneaking about in a panic showing up late for meetings and 
avoiding the boss extremely lifelike behavior in many offices 
other robots in brooks lab include the collection machine 
which collects empty soda cans and the confection machine which 
uses money it earns peddling candy to buy services from obliging 
humans such as opening doors 
ingenious as they are todays specimens are reassuringly far 
from the nightmares of science fiction computers are expected to 
achieve only squirrellike intelligence by the beginning of the 
next century 
right now artificial life is much simpler than a fungus its 
nothing like a mouse let alone a human hillis says even the 
most advanced computer viruses considered by many to be the 
precursors of artificial life are a far cry from life as we know 
it 
the distinction between living and nonliving blurred earlier 
this year when mit researchers created the first synthetic molecule 
capable of lifelike selfreplication amino adenosine triacid ester 
aate may help explain how organic chemicals acquired the 
ability to copy themselves a prerequisite for life 
no one would argue that the primitive molecule created at mit is 
a long way from dna the elaborate template that carries the 
hereditary code for all living things but as one might expect 
optimism is a common trait among scientists who aspire to breathe 
life into legos 
their highesttech tool is the connection machine a 5 million 
supercomputer made by hillis cambridge mass company thinking 
machines 
the connection machine has 64000 processors a personal 
computer has one picture a football stadium full of people each 
with a pc all computing at once hillis says since each 
processor controls the behavior of a program or individual 
the computer works much like evolution only faster in the 
connection machine 5 million years of human evolution collapse to 
just under 70 hours 
its speed and processing capabilities make the connection 
machine ideal for the bottom up approach favored by hillis and 
others traditional science works by taking apart frogs and 
flowers to see whats inside he says but its hard to figure 
out whats going on if you dont understand the rules 
rather than take life apart living things dont respond well 
to dissection artificial lifers hope to put it together 
not everyone is enthused do you want to understand murder by 
studying murderers or by committing one says purdue university 
computer scientist eugene spafford artificial life research 
shouldnt consist of throwing chemicals into a test tube to see if 
something crawls out and introduces itself there should be 
theories behind whats being done 
some are taking a more theoretical approach others remain 
convinced their tinkering will produce lifelike behavior but is it 
live or is it memorex 
artificial lifers believe you can abstract the behavioral 
essence from any particular material the question is what do you 
lose says pattee my feeling at present is that artificial 
life simulations are so far from the actual organization of living 
systemsthat to call it artificial life in any more than a 
simulation sense is carrying it too far 
though theres plenty of debate few think the future of 
artificial life rests on the outcome theres been a lot of hype 
and wild claims says michigans john holland but theres also 
talk of beautiful patterns and elegant experiments i 
feel like a gardener hillis says you water and weed and 
sometimes you sprout flowers 
the garden could prove dazzling 
along with furthering our understanding of biology artificial 
life techniques could bring revolutionary advances in medicine 
engineering and computer science 
deciphering differentiation the process by which genes create 
different cell types could lead to engineered life forms capable 
of tasks too hazardous for humans 
artificial life also could broaden the context of evolution 
theory says stuart kauffman of the university of pennsylvania 
school of medicine whose work in this area spans 20 years 
darwin regarded organisms as tinkeredtogether contraptions 
because natural selection sifts through random mutations and pulls 
out useful variations in fact there may be principles of order 
and organization that lie behind these historical accidents 
universal laws or physics of biology if we can find the laws the 
medium doesnt matter 
like many in the field holland finds his outlook on life 
evolving more and more we realize that a lot of what we thought 
was spirit and mind is directly affected by physics and chemistry 
if one takes that view of humans the idea of thinking 
feeling machines becomes more plausible it also he says begs 
the question should we as humans bring these things into 
being 
between artificial life research and recombinant dna technology 
this power to manipulate is growing the question is how to 
manage it says george a cowan president of the santa fe 
institute a private center for studying complex systems 
odd juxtapositions abound at the institute housed in a former 
convent computers fill cubicles that once were nuns dormitories 
a chapels stainedglass windows now illuminate a conference room 
what better place for wouldbe creators of artificial universes to 
ponder moral implications of playing god 
when does a model of a living thing become a living thing 
should artificial life fulfill humanitys needs or its own what is 
a creators responsibility to his creation to society 
how would danny hillis programs perceive their universe 
whose programs are we

editors note its viewed as a symbol of growing religious 
tolerance in the city of the popes an islamic house of worship 
virtually in the shadow of the vatican the architect of the 
mosque expected to be completed next year is a roman catholic who 
feels it is one of the most important monuments to be built in rome 
this century 
</TEXT>

an islamic mosque is rising in this seat of the 
roman catholic church something that would have been almost 
unthinkable a few decades ago 
not just any mosque its a 45 million complex capable of 
seating 2000 and believed to be the biggest islamic house of 
worship in all of europe 
and in a historic gesture of christianmoslem tolerance one of 
the first visitors to the mosque could be pope john paul ii 
we will invite him to our inauguration and i am almost 
positive he will come says abdul qayyum khan director of the 
islamic cultural center of italy 
the ceremony is tentatively set for the spring the vatican says 
it is too early to say whether john paul will attend but stresses 
that he is dedicated to pursuing dialogue with islam and other 
religions 
in any case the fact that a huge mosque has risen virtually in 
the back yard of the vatican is an unmistakable symbol of mutual 
tolerance between two faiths with ancient rivalries 
i think this mosque is one of the most important monuments 
built in rome in this century says paolo portoghesi a roman 
caholic who is the main architect of the mosque it is an 
expression of religious liberty and religious dialogue in the 
modern world 
yet delays in the project may have been linked to fears in some 
circles that the mosques minaret would be higher than the dome of 
st peters basilica located about 2 miles away across the tiber 
river 
there are deep hostilities in some parts of roman society for 
minorities portoghesi says there have been battles because 
naturally not everyone was in agreement on building a mosque in 
rome we had to overcome many obstacles 
the project is about threequarters finished still to be 
completed are the minaret a twostory cultural center and a 
landscaped public garden the complex will include a 500seat 
conference hall and one of the largest moslem libraries in the 
west with books in arabic english and italian 
we hope everything will be finished within six months before 
next summer says khan a pakistani who is overseeing the 
project we hope we will be able to use the mosque for our 
festival prayers after the ramadan 
with the arrival in recent years of thousands of immigrants from 
countries such as morocco tunisia and algeria islam has become 
increasingly visible in overwhelmingly roman catholic italy 
there are no official figures on the number of moslems in italy 
and khan is reluctant to make an estimate but italian media 
reports have put the number at more than 300000 nationwide 
including 50000 in rome 
we really needed a place where we could say our friday 
prayers says khan sitting in a temporary office in a trailer on 
the construction site we used to rent apartments or halls but 
they could accommodate 50 60 or at most 100 people the number was 
increasing all the time and we were shifting from place to place 
looking for more room 
because immigration is a new phenomenon and many of the new 
arrivals survive by taking jobs that most italians dont want the 
moslem community is still looking to assert itself in italian 
society 
one of the most prominent moslem names in italy is prince karim 
aga khan spiritual leader of the worlds 15 million ishmaili 
moslems although he lives in france the aga khan developed a 
jetset resort on the island of sardinia and is a familiar figure 
in italian social circles 
there are nearly 1000 christian churches in rome and two large 
and six small synagogues but unlike london paris and other major 
european capitals rome has never had a mosque 
the idea for a mosque in the city of popes goes back some 
decades but the project didnt start taking shape until the 
vatican announced in 1974 that pope paul vi had no objections the 
decision reflected the new openness to other religions set out in 
the 196265 second vatican council 
romes communistled city government of the time then donated an 
undeveloped 75acre plot at the foot of monte antenne in the 
exclusive parioli district 
there had been a kind of reluctance to have a mosque in the 
heart of the catholic world khan says a general argument was 
that the moslems do not permit a church in their own holiest places 
like mecca and medina but with the passing of time and the change 
of circumstances the project was deemed necessary 
still it took another decade before bulldozers went into 
action work was blocked because conservationists and local 
residents objected that construction would ruin the environment and 
cause traffic problems 
the final hurdles were cleared when the islamic cultural center 
pledged to plant 100 trees on the site and build a lighted access 
road routing traffic away from heavily populated areas 
when construction finally began in late 1984 officials 
predicted work would be completed in three years but various 
legal financial and bureaucratic problems slowed the project 
the cost was originally put at 30 million to be covered by 
contributions from moslem individuals and more than 20 moslem 
countries led by saudi arabia and iraq with 7 million apiece 
after the price tag soared to 45 million and the money nearly 
ran out saudi king fahd earlier this year personally donated the 
extra 15 million needed to complete the project khan says 
the latest delay involves the height of the minaret a slender 
circular tower attached to the mosque 
the minaret was designed to be 128 feet high but the islamic 
cultural center was recently told that a special license is 
required for any structure over 82 feet 
for the moment pending the goahead from regional officials 
the minaret remains wrapped in scaffolding and flanked by idle 
cranes 
khan insists the delay is strictly a matter of bureaucracy and 
has nothing to do with the rumors the minaret would be even taller 
than st peters in fact the dome of st peters is about four 
times higher than the planned minaret 
the minaret has also raised fears among neighborhood residents 
that its balcony would be used by a muezzin or crier to call the 
faithful to prayer five times a day 
but khan has promised them the tower wont be used for that 
traditional practice 
the inhabitants were a little afraid that we might be calling 
people to prayers at 430 or 5 in the morning khan says we 
told them no the minaret is just a symbolic thing without it 
the mosque is not really a mosque

rome ap if romes mosque is a mute symbol of 
christianmoslem harmony then paolo portoghesi is a living symbol 
portoghesi a roman catholic and seventhgeneration native of 
this city of popes is the leader of the team of architects that 
designed romes first moslem house of worship 
this has been the most important project of my career says 
portoghesi 59 one of italys most prominent architects and a 
wellknown rome socialite and socialist party figure 
the mosque is not only a symbol of islams important place in 
the world he says but it is also a sign of the new 
catholicism one that is not rigidly closed to other religions but 
is tolerant and open to dialogue 
portoghesi is not new to the world of islam he has traveled and 
studied extensively in moslem countries he teaches islamic 
architecture at the university of rome and has designed 
stilltobebuilt mosques in jordan and sudan 
when they had the international competition for the rome 
mosque i participated with enthusiasm because it was a subject i 
was familiar with he says 
the commission of islamic experts judging the designs eventually 
narrowed the choice to two architects portoghesi and sami mousawi 
of iraq in the end the two architects were assigned to merge 
their designs into one 
the result is what portoghesi describes as a blend of islamic 
and roman tradition 
we chose forms of architecture which express the dialogue 
between the two cultures he says the intertwined arches are 
typical of islam but they also were used centuries ago by francesco 
borromini all the material we used such as travertine is typical 
of rome 
even the garden he says will harmonize the two civilizations 
pine trees of rome and palm trees of the desert 
portoghesi takes more pride in the mosques artistic traits than 
in its imposing size 
it is probably the biggest mosque in europe but that is a 
distinction that could soon be surpassed by others he says we 
dont want it to be the biggest we want it to be la piu bella 
most beautiful

editors note a new yorker reverting to his roots is giving 
tender loving care to a tiny mailorder christmas tree growing in 
the windowsill of his manhattan studio apartment it wont be big 
enough to hold even a single ornament this year but he figures 
that one day it could rival the rockefeller center behemoth outside 
his office window 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
outside my office the rockefeller center 
christmas tree stands 75 feet high and 35 feet wide some 20 blocks 
away in my west side apartment my own tree stands 10 inches high 
and maybe 2 inches wide 
the rockefeller center tree had been growing 61 years since 
shirley cencis father planted it in her front yard in norwalk 
conn my tree has been growing about eight weeks now and is just 
budding tentative arms along its pencilthin trunk 
the rockefeller tree has 20000 lights festooned around its full 
and bountiful branches i dont see my tree bearing ornaments this 
year not even tinsel for that matter but it shows promise 
there is one larger difference between them however this is 
the last year for the rockefeller norway spruce it is the first 
christmas for mine 
its in my studio apartment because the price of christmas trees 
skyrocketed in manhattan last year i only wanted a small tree 3 
feet tops but the best price was 40 so i went without 
i thought of decorating one of my house plants but somehow 
ornaments and lights on elephant ears jarred my traditional 
sensibilities instead one evening i tuned in a local tv channel 
that plays christmas songs and shows a decorated tree and a burning 
yule log then i watched its a wonderful life and miracle 
on thirtyfourth street that was my manhattan christmas 
come new years eve i had no parched tree to carry down to the 
basement and no trail of dried needles to be swept up the maid 
liked that 
but this summer i got a mailed offer of an infant colorado 
spruce for 1 from the national arbor day foundation in nebraska 
city neb i snapped it up 
it arrived this fall with planting instructions a spindly 
helpless thing with only the hint of life after soaking its roots 
for about 10 hours i put it in a pot watered it and watched 
intently but nothing happened 
then ever so slowly it began to stir like a baby yawning after 
a deep sleep 
no baby gets closer attention i check its damp soil three times 
a day fight off the urge to water more than once a week i talk to 
it a little like i talked to my children when they were learning to 
walk 
it occupies a prime spot in my studio apartment with southern 
exposure and a controlled climate that should give it a long 
growing season 
christmas trees were always a part of my life i even sold them 
as a kid in detroit 
when the nation was digging out of the depression dad would 
wait until christmas eve before going out and hunting up a bargain 
he would buy extra branches drill holes in the trunk fill in the 
empty spaces mom would dig out the boxes of ornaments collected 
over a lot of christmases and we would spend the rest of christmas 
eve adorning 
this christmas i will adorn the base of my tree with a few 
ornaments and maybe a string of lights along the bottom of the pot 
it also gave me an idea i have for a pittance ordered a red 
maple and a silver maple from the arbor day foundation for my two 
little grandsons the seedlings should arrive in the spring and 
they can watch them grow as they do the mike and matt trees 
and i have high hopes for christmases to come my tree the 
instructions say is destined to rise to a height of 75 feet my 
apartment has 8foot ceilings but ill deal with that when the 
time comes

editors note its not an unfamiliar scenario in the english 
countryside a grand old manor house is sold because the present 
owners cant afford the needed repairs and upkeep but this time 
the cast of characters included kinfolk of novelist jane austen and 
the unloading of the estate ruffled a lot of feathers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
alongside silhouettes of longnosed 
women a worn writing table and a lock of light brown hair three 
signs grace the cottage where jane austen wrote her last novels 
please note this house has not been sold and never will be 
say the handwritten messages tucked between exhibits the notes 
allude to family squabbles money woes and misunderstandings to 
rival those from the novelists own pen 
here in this tiny village not far from her birthplace the 
author of pride and prejudice and emma lived from 1809 to 
1817 in a cottage now a museum loaned to her by her wealthy 
brother edward 
his elizabethan manor house soon to be a luxury hotel and golf 
club is up the road it was the recent sale of the manor house 
named chawton house which ruffled a lot of feathers 
i had people ringing up in tears saying how could you close 
jane austens house says jean bowden the amenable curator of 
the novelists cottage everybody thought it was us being sold 
not the great house 
miss bowden a botanist placed the signs in the museum to 
squelch rumors yet attendance rose as misinformed devotees rushed 
to see the museum run by an independent trust before it was gone 
for others the sale last january truly caused dismay 
henry rice a greatgreatgreat grandson of the authors niece 
formed a trust last year to buy the manor and convert it into a 
jane austen research center but he couldnt meet the asking price 
of owner richard knight a descendent of edward 
today rices search for a house in which jane austen would 
have felt comfortable continues both in chawton and beyond and 
he doesnt see much of his distant relation 
we dont have much to talk about hes gone one way and ive 
gone the other says rice a retired farmer hes gone into the 
hotel business thats very little to do with jane austen 
nor did the author herself spend much time at the great house 
she liked to stroll about the splendid grounds and visit when her 
brother and his large family were there but edward mostly lived at 
other estates 
one of janes six brothers edward inherited his properties from 
a rich benefactor thomas knight later edward took the name of 
knight 
jane austen was not rich the daughter of a clergyman she never 
married and had little pocket money until several of her books were 
published shortly before she died at age 42 in 1817 
the writer with her keen observations of families and human 
nature would well have understood the money woes that drove 
richard knight to sell the great house 
nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say 
what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be 
she wrote in 1815 
when knight a farmer inherited chawton house he realized he 
couldnt afford to repair or keep the 51room manor where floors 
sag and rain leaks into 16thcentury oakpaneled rooms 
after mulling over offers knight sold the house on a 125year 
lease to a colorful entrepreneur robert jarman and two other 
local businessmen who plan to spend about 40 million to convert it 
into a 39bedroom luxury hotel and golf club 
under the agreement after 125 years the knights will be given 
the house along with gardens restored to their austenera splendor 
and hundreds of acres of former estate property being repurchased 
for two 18hole golf courses 
one hundred and twentyfive years is a long time but in terms 
of 400 to 500 years in the family its not so bad says knight 
adding that he believes jane austen would have found the 
arrangement a jolly answer to his difficulties 
in a sense were restoring the estate to his family says 
jarman a bearded man who charges enthusiastically across the 
grounds in his jeep to show a visitor its wild beauty and future 
potential 
jarman who calls himself a frustrated architect has hired 
a welsh architect famous for his restorations and the two have 
worked closely to try to preserve the house one wing of bedrooms 
for example will be built into a hill 
i dont want to iron out any of the magic says huw thomas 
the architect its rather like an agatha christie set 
gradually their efforts to tread carefully won over the 
skeptical residents of the village population 330 and those 
living nearby in the rolling hills and pastures of hampshire 
i had doubts about it originally because i thought having two 
full golf courses in chawton was a bit much says colin allen 
who represents the village on the regional planning board 
but after seeing how carefully it was all thought out i 
changed my mind he says my views were affected by the local 
peoplethey were in favor because it wasnt going to spoil the 
village 
wed all prefer the family to be living there says the 
curator jean bowden but the current solution is nice it keeps 
the squire in the village 
in her own practical way perhaps jane austen too might have 
approved she once wrote that endings shouldnt dwell on guilt 
and misery 
i quit such odious subjects as soon as i can she wrote 
impatient to restore everybody not greatly in fault themselves 
to tolerable comfort and to have done with all the rest

editors note second only to its steaks perhaps kansas city 
in the 1920s and 30s was known for its jazz and swinging nighclubs 
featuring the likes of count basie and charlie parker there are 
still plenty of jazz musicians in the city and several 
organizations are struggling to keep the tradition alive but few 
today can make a lic full time

when little willving making musiie littlefield wrote the 
popular tune goin to kansas city in the early 1900s jazz 
musicians flocked here for the the good life and plenty of gigs 
nightclubs lined the streets and the joints were jumping from 
early evening to early morning seven days a week 
today hundreds of jazz musicians and a halfdozen jazz 
organizations are struggling to keep kansas citys jazz tradition 
alive about 400 jazz and blues soloists and more than 70 bands are 
competing for a shrinking share of the economic pie 
the money coming in from the city corporations and the public 
isnt enough to sustain a healthy jazz community in kansas city 
most musicians say 
the city has a certain amount of money and the jazzt to fame 
here in his hometown in the 30s count basie was a regular in the 
clubs here 
but with the end of pendergasts political career in 1938 after 
his indictment on tax evasion charges came the end of the jazz 
heyday 
reform elements took over nightclubs and cabarets were shut 
down jobs for musicians dried up and the kansas city bands took to 
the road 
oldtimers who remember the jazz scene as it used to be lament 
the way things are now 
jackson says finding a gig was easy back then but today not 
even 10 percent of the citys musicians can live by music alone 
i feel sad people as a whole do not support jazz in this 
town jackson says it is pathetic people like to listen but 
they dont want to spend money for it 
the city is not living up to the past reputation says kathe 
kaul head organizer of the annual kansas city jazz festival 
its a different time

joan van ark has nothing but praise for patty 
duke her costar in the cbs movie always remember i love you 
one day during the filming in vancouver canada she says the 
two were scheduled for a tv interview im sure they were 
expecting two dueling divas she says instead we came out and 
hugged each other 
in the movie which cbs put into the prechristmas lineup on 
sunday they play the mothers of a teenage boy who discovers by 
accident that he was adopted miss van ark is the adoptive mother 
martha and miss duke is the real mother ruth 
the boy played by stephen dorff learns that he had been 
kidnapped 14 years earlier in a babyselling racket and sold to a 
couple he had believed were his real parents he sets out to find 
his birth parents then must choose which family he wants to stay 
with 
in the original script patty and i never meet but the network 
asked for a confrontation scene miss van ark says its a very 
brief scene the next day i sent patty flowers and a note that 
said ill never forget how you touched marthas heart and my 
soul 
patty duke is such a gift for an actor to have in a scene she 
is there 200 percent ive never felt such support 
miss van ark says one reason she was attracted to the script was 
because it supports family values you dont find enough of that 
on television she says 
always remember i love you also stars david birney as miss 
van arks husband richard masur as miss dukes husband and sam 
wannamaker as birneys father vivienne radkoff wrote the 
screenplay and michael miller directed 
this is one of the most genuinely moving and rooted scripts 
ive ever read miss van ark says you dont have to push for 
the dilemma he has two sets of parents and he has to make a 
choice if weve done our work right the audience will have as 
difficult a choice as the boy does 
we had decided not to tell him hes adopted but he finds out 
when the lawyer who arranged for the adoption is arrested in a 
childselling scandal i tell him how much we wanted a child its 
a terrible blow and he bolts out determined to find his real 
parents 
miss van ark describes her character martha mendham as 
affluent with manicured nails bluntcut hair chanel suits 
very east coast 
miss van ark who has starred as valene on cbs knots 
landing since it began in 1979 is dressed in a bright red plaid 
jacket and black skirt for a christmas video greeting from the 
series cast to the troops in saudi arabia 
bill devanes living room is decorated for christmas for the 
video she says this jacket makes me look like a christmas 
package my house is being remodeled and all our furniture and 
clothes are in storage i asked my housekeeper to find me something 
red and this is what she came up with 
she was also preparing to leave for bermuda to appear on a bob 
hope special 
miss van ark is married to television newsman john marshall and 
their daughter vanessa is in college they had known each other 
since high school in boulder colo but in college they went their 
separate ways they met again when she was doing barefoot in the 
park in london and he was stationed in germany 
they were married in germany and for a honeymoon toured every 
european city made famous by her namesake joan of arc 
she is an accomplished marathon runner and no matter what her 
schedule says she finds time to run because its my therapy 
while in high school she interviewed actress julie harris who 
advised her to go to the yale school of drama she won a 
scholarship right out of high school later harris played her 
mother on knots landing 
miss van ark starred in two earlier series temperatures 
rising and weve got each other she made two guest 
appearances on dallas as a young downonherluck waitress who 
marries into the ewing family she was then hired to reprise the 
role in the dallas spinoff

the familiar 20th century fox logo appears on the screen with 
its art moderne towers and searchlights in a snowstorm you know 
something unusual is going to happen 
leave it to tim burton to provide a unique screen experience he 
did it with peewees big adventure spectacularly with 
beetlejuice less so with batman with edward 
scissorhands he explores new avenues of creativity 
edward scissorhands has all the goodhearted fantasy of 
et the extraterrestrial which it resembles in both films a 
strange creature appears in an american suburb and is embraced by 
some citizens and threatened by others in the end the visitor is 
driven away by human ignorance and misunderstanding 
edward johnny depp is the creation of a benign dr 
frankenstein played with customary flair by vincent price the 
inventor equips edward with footlong shears and scissors instead 
of hands before price can finish the job with humanlike hands he 
dies 
edward huddles alone in a castle atop a wooded mountain then 
one day the avon lady pays a call she is dianne wiest who lives 
with her family in a bland pastel subdivision incongruously 
situated at the foot of the mountain she takes the bewildered 
edward home and makes him part of the family 
the other suburbanites are astonished then delighted with 
edward especially after he makes statuelike topiaries out of 
their trees and bushes styles the womens hair and poodlecuts 
their dogs edward appears on tv and undertakes a beauty salon he 
also falls in love with wiests daughter winona ryder 
predictably edwards new world becomes threatened bringing a 
melodramatic ending that is the least of burtons concoctions 
burton was once a disney animator and it shows prices lab 
and edwards scissors are masterpieces of movement the characters 
have the sweetness of a disney film without being cloying 
especially good are wiests everoptimistic mother and alan arkins 
decent plaintalking father 
depps edward is haunting with his scarred melancholy white 
face painted lips and querying eyes ryder is appealing as his 
wouldbe sweetheart 
burton and screenwriter caroline thompson have fun with the 
rituals of suburbia barbecues gossip etc the production by 
burton and denise di nova is brilliant with lookalike houses and 
costumes colorkeyed as they were in warren beattys dick 
tracy

henry v cbsfox home video vhsbeta 9298 rated pg 
 
when an example of artistic excellence reaches the screen it is 
a time for celebration so break out the cristal kenneth branaghs 
henry v has reached the home video market 
a spare wellcrafted interpretation of the play by william 
shakespeare branaghs movie focuses on the complex young king 
rather than the pagentry and expansiveness of the conflict between 
french and english 
branagh who directed himself in the title role sees henry as 
vulnerable ambitious compassionate crafty and highly 
intelligent it is this almost pure intellect that slices through 
the gray misty chill of the battlefield 
it is quite unlike laurence oliviers 1944 classic made during 
the patriotism of world war ii both are very fine in different 
ways oliviers is heroic in a direct chauvinistic way branaghs 
is psychologically heroic 
the directors performance is a marvel full of lyricism and 
shakesperean bravura the loyalty of a compassionate sovereign 
unfolds the night before agincourt where the small english force 
defeated a bigger french army and a nice touch henry doesnt even 
realize the victory h asks the french herald which side won that 
day 
the power and serenity of branaghs st crispin day speech might 
bring a tear or two and will definitely cause the skin to tingle 
there are stunning performances throughout ian holm as 
fluellen paul scofield as the king of france brian blessed as 
exeter judi dench as mistress quickly and emma thompson as 
princess katherine 
derek jacobi is the modernday chorus in this imaginatively 
staged movie 
henry v is a video for the home library buy it 
 
grim prairie tales academy vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
production notes for grim prairie tales say the movies 
writerdirector wayne coe was designing film posters when he 
decided to risk it all and become a filmmaker in 1985 
he should have stayed at the drawing board 
this anthology of stories all taking place in the old west is so 
wooden so thick so slow that it makes the worst tv soap opera 
look like a highspeed chase 
not even the talented james earl jones who can make a reading 
of the telephone book sound like a shakespearean passage can turn 
this clunker into anything worthwhile 
jones portrays a bounty hunter named morrison who stops by the 
camp fire of a writer named farley brad dourif one chilly night 
farley is on his way to see his wife morrison is on his way to 
collect a few bucks for the corpse draped over his saddlebag 
they mix like oil and water and soon discover their one common 
ground is storytelling morrison goes first with a tale about an 
indian burial ground the story is supposed to be scary if you 
can stay awake long enough to the end scary it aint rambling it 
is 
farley though is all fired up by this one and demands another 
the second story is weird with a sick erotic spin at the end its 
about the best of the lot but it would never make the semifinals 
for a twilight zone audition the competition is afoot and 
farley boasts that the story hes about to tell is the best like 
the others in this uncreative celluloid yarn farleys story about 
a pioneer family and the killing game the menfolk play at night has 
a promising start and then fades to nothing 
the last story is morrisons a story about a gunslinger its 
supposed to be haunting but is predictable and flat 
grim prairie tales lasted only a blink during its illfated 
theatrical run make that crawl obviously the producers richard 
hahn whose credit is something called kandyland and andrzej 
kamrowski who did a documentary called polanski in poland 
intended this project for the video market but dont fall for it 
if you buy it or rent it youll only hate yourself

katydids reprise katydids 
 
to some ears the next blip in the trendhappy rock world will 
be third generation poprock bands who owe allegiance to the 
beatles hollies and raspberries american bands such as seattles 
posies have deservedly received attention but dont neglect the 
katydids from britain 
the katydids selftitled debut is a sparkling collection of pop 
tunes energetically performed singer susie hug and guitarist adam 
seymour wrote all 11 songs 
lights out read my lips one of the few songs in recent 
years to prominently feature a tambourine is strong enough that 
you overlook the cliche 
the rockigg stop start and melancholy girl in a jigsaw 
puzzle both deal with the eternal subject of faltering 
relationships all above me and what will the angels say 
show a strong religious influence but as are many good pop songs 
they are vague enough to have multiple interpretations 
producer nick lowe no stranger to strong pop music has never 
been known to fiddle incessantly with an arrangement he believes 
in capturing the most inspired take and wrapping up recording 
an approach that serves the katydids well 
this band wont win any awards for originality heavy weather 
traffic owes an obvious debt to the who and dr rey could be 
matched with the beatles dr robert 
still this is a bright debut 
by david bauder associated press writer 
 
dear 23 david geffen co the posies 
 
like talking heads 77 and rems 1983 album murmur 
the posies majorlabel debut is a rock milestone an album that 
progressive bands six or seven years from now will cite as an 
influence 
the seattlebased quartet sets out to redefine the early 
psychedelic sound that blossomed in the mid to late60s and 
succeeds with thrilling harmonies and jangly guitars their chorus 
structure on golden blunders for example echoes the hollies 
i love jennifer eccles from 1968 
but the posies are not merely a throwback band their lyrics by 
singerguitarists jonathan auer and kenneth stringfellow exhibit 
refreshing levels of wit and depth 
the song title golden blunders is a play on the beatles 
golden slumbers the tunes sobering subject is the heavy 
consequences of unprotected sex pregnancy and early marriage 
men and women please beware dont pretend you care nothing 
lasts when theres nothing there the posies warn 
much of the material reflects the songwriters youth their main 
concerns are love doubt and separation but the posies prove that 
even these wellworn subjects can sparkle with some clever 
handling she left me alone claiming wed run out of things to 
talk about i was crushed of course but at least ive got something 
i can write about they sing on any other way 
it seems appropriate even inevitable that the posies hail from 
the pacific northwest where many 1960s flower children still 
nurture the dream of a new age the posies are a part of that 
future

nick nolte lounges in the front row of 
benches in the kanawha county courtroom one arm thrown over the 
back of the seat watching two lawyers debate a minor point in a 
preliminary hearing 
people know charlestons most famous resident is down at the 
courthouse today even in west virginias biggest city population 
63000 word spreads fast 
but they leave him alone aside from the judge the defendant 
two court officers and the lawyers hes studying the actors got 
the room to himself 
no fans demanding his attention no producers demanding his 
time no costars demanding he watch them strut their stuff and 
except briefly no reporters demanding details of his life 
and thats why nolte who works on the fringe of hollywoods 
imageobsessed film industry and skirts the edge of stardom finds 
himself more at home in the hills of west virginia than in los 
angeles or new york 
this whole business concept of stardom its a thing i find 
very entrapping very limiting and not worth a damn he said i 
really dont function at all in my thinking on that level 
nolte was busy filming cape fear martin scorseses remake 
of the 1962 gregory peckrobert mitchum film in which an exconvict 
blames a lawyer for his sentence and threatens the lawyers wife 
nolte plays the lawyer who defends and betrays robert de niro 
he researched much of the role in his adopted hometown spending 
several days haunting the kanawha county courthouse and jail to 
observe lawyers and judges at work 
i want to see the demeanor of a lawyer i want to see how he 
behaves in the courtroom how he behaves with a client see how 
hes thinking i want to figure out the points of law nolte 
said 
he has researched roles in charleston before including his part 
as a homeless man in down and out in beverly hills because he 
said he can do it without much distraction and get closer to those 
hes studying 
look if i was trying to do this research up in new york city 
say or in la in the court system it would be very difficult 
to approach it its just a much more complex city its 
impersonalized its complicated its fastpaced nolte said 
and i certainly do need a certain kind of pace when im not in 
the actual process of doing a film i need a pace where i can think 
a little 
thats what he gets in west virginias capital a compact city 
snuggled along the snaking kanawha river and sheltered by the 
appalachian foothills 
although he owns a house in malibu calif nolte retreats to 
charleston where his wife becky and a previous wife sharon 
haddad both grew up and he can avoid hobnobbing with the film 
crowd 
to nolte living in new york or los angeles inevitably forces 
actors to compete against each other to prove acting ability and 
commercial clout 
one of the reasons i live in west virginia is to stay away 
from that rather than living in one of the film centers that 
constantly talk about this film succeeding and that film and 
whether this guy was good and that guy was good he said i 
like to get away from that judgmental kind of thinking 
the relaxed lifestyle of charleston also suits nolte who grew 
up in a similar atmosphere in omaha neb and ames iowa 
i play golf and i hike and stuff like that said nolte who 
played football while bouncing through five different colleges in 
the early 1960s he also loves to fish 
its also easier for nolte the father to get out in charleston 
with his 4yearold son brawley 
i have my son up in new york city and i get him outside the 
hotel for a walk in the park and its fairly intense nolte 
said here i can take him out let him run on the street play 
in the backyard and the woods in la if i want to take him 
to the park i have to get him in a car and go on a freeway thats 
the most traveled road in the world 
nolte 49 has found himself on some lesstraveled roads as an 
actor which he became after abandoning college in 1962 
he started hanging out at a pasadena calif theater with an 
actor friend to meet girls he says and got hooked on the 
stage a decade of touring the midwest landed him back in los 
angeles in 1973 where he finally hit it big in 1976 with the tv 
miniseries rich man poor man

working steadily since then noltes had hits 48 hrs 
down and out in beverly hills misses everybody wins 
farewell to the king and films in between qampa wholl 
stop the rain 
he recently finished the prince of tides based on pat 
conroys novel and directed by and costarring barbra streisand he 
plays a high school teacher and football coach coping with family 
problems in south carolina 
its about a dysfunctional family he said its a great 
southern story 
nolte draws upon his experience as well as research to prepare 
for roles although he keeps the personal parts private 
through it all nolte remains a modest boxoffice draw and he 
prefers his lowkey stardom to something on the level of a tom 
cruise 
his biggest commercial successes have come when hes shared the 
marquee with eddie murphy in the two 48 hrs movies and with 
richard dreyfuss and bette midler in down and out the films he 
carries tend to be offbeat and mildly successful at best 
hes paid well for his mainstream movies a reported 3 million 
for farewell to the king but nolte said he is constantly 
contradicting a hollywood mentality that says an actor has a 
certain salary base he shouldnt take less 
that limits the film he can operate in he said when a 
film is operating the best there is no star system it is an 
ensemble consequently if i can go to a film and see the film 
without seeing myself then i think ive accomplished the task of 
fitting into the theme of the film 
amiable joking and accommodating in an interview nolte on 
screen projects a gruffness and intensity that intimidates 
but he uses variations on that persona to compile a diverse 
portfolio of characters a noble drug runner in wholl stop the 
rain a beatnik in heart beat a playwright convict in 
weeds an egocentric artist in new york stories 
the trouble with stardom is that it has a tendency to 
pigeonhole you it has a tendency to classify you it dictates a 
certain kind of popularity nolte said 
basically you want to play characters and stories that 
intrigue you and whether that man is a leading man or an evil man 
or whatever you want to approach those roles that fulfill you and 
those stories that fulfill you 
once filming is over nolte moves on to the next role and does 
not look back 
those roles i did before i wouldnt want to play them now 
he said its chronological as i grow old as a person that 
story was the interest and the focus at that time thats why i had 
to tell that story thats why i got involved 
now in no way could i now go back and do wholl stop the 
rain and think in those terms i dont quite think the same way 
nolte said 
laughing he added im probably a little more corrupt

judith jamison was the biggest star the alvin 
ailey american dance theater had in its 32 years she is now at the 
helm of the modern dance company as it twirls through its first new 
york season with an artistic director other than its founder 
jamison was named artistic director after aileys death last 
year on dec 1 the season had gone on that month as planned in a 
kind of shocked state for both dancers and audiences 
since labor day the company has performed in the soviet union 
france england and kansas city in denmark it videotaped 
episodes and for bird with love for showing by pbs next 
february 
two works ailey choreographed including hidden rites are 
being revived for the current season and five new dances are being 
added ranging from impinyuza pearl primus 1952 paean to the 
royal dancers of the watusi in ruanda to read matthew 1128 by 
young kris world who danced and sang on a stevie wonder tour 
there are also works by donald mckayle lar lubovitch for his 
own company and jamison for the jamison project the 12member 
dance company she had before being called to head the ailey 
im excited about the season she said in an interview 
sometimes the company is only known as a highenergyburning 
exciting company north star by lar is a softer way of moving 
they look beautiful doing that 
the people dancing in the company now whove been here on an 
average of four or five years havent danced primus dudley 
williams has he is working on his 26th year here i think she is 
one of our unsung heroines of dance as well as a great 
anthropologist i wanted to present the men of the company in a 
piece that was afrocentric theyre magnificent 
alvins hidden rites is from the john parksjamison era it 
hasnt been done since then its part of alvins vocabulary these 
dancers had never visited dudley was the last person to dance 
alvins hermit songs three dancers will alternate it this 
season its about a monk 
next season jamison plans to revive the mooche set to music 
by duke ellington jamison left the ailey in 1980 to costar in 
duke ellingtons sophisticated ladies on broadway 
the hardest thing jamison has to do as head of an established 
respected company of 28 dancers is delegate responsibility when 
i joined in 1965 there were 10 dancers and everybody did 
everything alvin needed something you did it now i have a staff 
a development director public relations and masazumi chaya the 
miracle of this company rehearsal director the last four years he 
can remember details and dances like no other 
im very good at molding the end result of rehearsals i say 
you know the steps let me coerce you into dancing it if you 
bring your entire being to this movement youre going to take a 
step in a direction you havent been in before 
jamison thinks it helps that shes a former dancer as was 
ailey the dancers know that i remember what its like to be in 
their shoes they let me get on stage with them a couple of minutes 
in read matthew 
six dancers from the jamison project have joined the ailey 
company its a nice injection of energy jamison says hastily 
adding not that this company needs energy it is nice to have 
some fresh blood 
alvin had the same idea i did you want a cecil b demille 
cast of thousands but the budget calls for 28 the six dancers 
from the jamison project learned 15 dances in six weeks 
thats when you realize that revelations isnt as easy as it 
looks jamison says revelations which ailey choreographed 
to spirituals in 1960 is called an american classic by jamison 
they loved it in russia she said it does the same thing to 
everyone all over the world 
we will always do alvins masterpieces revelations cry 
and blues suite and the repertory is going to be fed jamison 
said i think it is important the company does not sit as a 
museum piece alvin ailey was to me a free spirit a man who had 
extraordinary theatrical sense and a generosity beyond belief 
there arent other companies with men of his stature asg his 
peers to make dances for the company 
i think one of his major contributions was that he made dance 
accessible people who wouldnt naturally go to dance would come 
theyd have their lives changed and how they feel about theater 
dance changed part of my goal is to continue touching the hearts 
and minds of people especially young people

when george steinbrenner shared a guest star 
slot on saturday night live with them this fall the jokes were 
inevitable will the deposed new york yankees owner manage the 
time 
he was looking for a new team said time keyboardist jimmy 
jam harris we told him we had a bass player and he thought 
we said first base were ready to go now we told him wed wear 
hats and stuff 
despite steinbrenners wellknown habit of firing managers and 
coaches lead singer morris day made it clear whod be the boss in 
any such business arrangement 
artists dont work for managers day said managers work 
for artists if theres going to be any firing well be doing 
it 
control is an important word in the times vocabulary and not 
just because it was the title of the janet jackson album that 
brought harris and partner terry lewis fame as producers this 
reformed minneapolis septet feels more on top of its career than 
ever before for better and worse 
the times return is a rarity in pop music circles the reunion 
didnt take place because band members were desperate for money 
and it resulted in an album pandemonium thats clearly better 
than any of the three records the band recorded prior to its 1983 
breakup 
pandemonium is a raucous funkrock stew spiced by the slick 
comic sense of the sharpdressed day who dubs himself the 
aristocratic black the single jerk out has already hit the 
top 20 and chocolate is the second single 
we left the ball lying on the field and nobody picked it up 
after we broke up harris said we felt the ball was still 
there so we pumped a little air in it and were back 
the ballgame to the times eyes is an update of such old 
favorites as james brown and sly and the famil stone played by men 
who cut their teeth on real instruments instead of the sampling 
wizards harris and day disdain 
harris said band members remained friendly following the 1983 
dissolution and credited lewis with badgering the group into a 
reunion 
that took a little bit of time to get back together because 
youre talking about brothers that are used to splitting money 
maybe one or two ways now splitting it seven ways harris said 
it makes it a little more difficult in the final analysis i 
dont think this had anything to do with money 
the times merger was like a high school reunion where everyone 
succeeded day spurred by his role in princes purple rain 
has moved into acting harris and lewis can decorate their 
minneapolis studio with grammys won as producers guitarist jesse 
johnson has hit the top of the rhythm and blues chart and like 
keyboardist monte moir has his own production career 
percussionists jerome benton and jellybean johnson round out the 
band 
lurking behind the scenes is prince the bands unofficial 
eighth member 
individual success helped the bands technique and confidence 
and harris said changed the relationship with prince 
although prince used the pseudonym jamie starr for credit on 
time albums and members coyly denied his influence the time 
originally was little more than princes hired hands harris and 
lewis in fact were both fired from the time by prince when bad 
weather prevented them from returning from a production date in 
time for a concert 
theres really not any animosity harris said its nice 
to be able to come back into it and i guess have princes respect 
he played an important part of us being in a position to do what we 
did 
on pandemonium the time avoided taking any individual 
credit for the songs princes spokeswoman jill willis said 
prince wrote five of the songs on the album including jerk out 
and chocolate the minneapolis star tribune reported that 
jerk out was originally recorded in 1986 for another band on 
princes paisley park records 
when day was jokingly asked if he would be worried about being 
fired by steinbrenner he said it was prince who should be 
concerned 
but harris said prince didnt force himself on the band 
before we didnt really have a choice he was the one giving 
us the breaks and he was calling the shots harris said we 
felt in order to have all of the elements that made the time 
successful before he had to be involved 
he came into it as an equal partner this time as the eighth 
member of the group so to speak rather than as the boss we were 
more like on equal footing that was really nice 
the time returned their former boss favors performing on 
several songs on princes graffiti bridge soundtrack theyre 
in the movie too just as they were in princes breakthrough 
purple rain 
while solo success frees band members from depending on the 
time it also has its downside it leaves the bands future up in 
the air the day before the saturday night live appearance 
band members held a summit to discuss going on tour 
the conclusion no conclusion a tour is still a possibility 
but nothing is planned and it wont happen until at least next 
year said band spokesman gene shelton its a question of all 
seven members coordinating their schedules he said

not long ago lawrence block wrote a mystery 
series chronicling the travails of one bernie rhodenbarr a burglar 
who constantly broke in somewhere only to stumble across a murder 
and implicate himself 
rhodenbarr of course had to solve the murders to protect his 
neck 
the tone was amusing 
not so blocks books about excop matthew scudder the mood in 
those including his eighth and newest one a ticket to the 
boneyard is decidedly different 
dark i suppose is the word block said in an interview 
the one that is coming out next year down on the killing 
floor is done and its also a very dark book 
much of the darkness in boneyard flows from the villain 
james leo motley a remorseless killer who relentlessly and 
cleverly hunts down his victims 
people have said he is the most fully realized villain that 
ive done block said hes not based on an acquaintance i 
have not met this chap and do not want to 
he wrote the first three matt scudder books in 1974 
he and i had points in common block said he lives in a 
hotel on west 57th street when the series began he was recently 
separated from his wife and children and recently retired from the 
new york police department and drinking a lot in a saloon on ninth 
avenue 
i was living on west 58th street recently separated from my 
wife and three daughters and spending a lot of my time in the very 
saloon that scudder hung out in 
in other ways our background and nature were very different 
ive married since then seven years ago scudder has not i quit 
drinking i quit before he did when i started writing the books it 
never occurred to me that either of us would ever stop 
block proudly recounts that policemen have told him they like 
the scudder series they say the way he acts and reacts and the 
way his mind works is very believable block briefly was an 
auxiliary policeman in new york 
scudder is interesting to write about because he evolves his 
creator says 
the books are as much about him as they are about the cases 
block said 
that was not true of classic private detective fiction 
raymond chandler wrote that a detective should be someone who 
exists as a window through which we see the world i think that was 
fine when chandler did it i wouldnt be interested in writing that 
kind of book 
he said he is pleased people often ask for more books on bernie 
rhodenbarr who last appeared in 1983s the burglar who painted 
like mondrian his favorite 
block said he thinks hes done with rhodenbarr but he also 
thought that about scudder after the sixth book in that series 
noting i dont have a lot of control over what i write next 
my typical writing pattern is that ill write a book in a 
month to six weeks and spend the rest of the year thinking about 
the next one the enjoyable time is the two to three weeks between 
having finished writing a book and starting to agonize over the 
next one he said 
he started writing and selling stories while at antioch college 
in ohio he dropped out for a year to work as an editor for a new 
york literary agency and continued to write back at antioch he 
said he couldnt focus on school work 
my interest was writing and i grudged the time i had to spend 
on assignments and classes he said the school suggested i 
might be happier elsewhere ive been writing ever since 
he was always able to make a living 
hollywood made the scudder novel eight million ways to die 
into a movie starring jeff bridges and changed the hero to a 
heroine to cast whoopi goldberg in burglar taken from the 
burglar in the closet one of blocks early books deadly 
honeymoon was filmed as nightmare honeymoon 
he also wrote seven books in the late 1960s and early 70s about 
evan tanner a freelance spy and one of those may become a movie 
he wrote four about chip harrison two are comic novels about a 
young mans coming of age i liked writing that voice so much i put 
him to work for a private detective and wrote two mysterie 
he also has written some books not in series but publishers and 
bookstores like series he said 
it makes it a little closer to brandname advertising theres 
a preexisting audience for each volume he said 
readers like the same only different i find that myself as a 
reader sometimes if a writer will come out with a new series book 
ill read it i want to spend time with those characters

when a joke falls flat on hee haw 
the producers sometime look to a curvy blond southern belle to 
squeal 
more than once her squeaky voice has saved a laugh that 
otherwise would have been flat cornpone 
misty rowe plays that perky role as if she was born to it but 
behind the beautiful facade is a woman who has overcome some giant 
obstacles 
the childhood lisp was conquered years ago though a trace 
remains the death of her unborn baby last spring however was a 
setback that took months and a crosscountry move with which to 
come to terms 
oddly enough shes found solace in hee haw from an 
understanding cast and crew 
the baby would have been the first for rowe and her husband 
james depaiva an actor who portrayed max holden for three years on 
the soap opera one life to live 
the couple dealt with their devastation by relocating from new 
york city to her original home in the los angeles area depaiva 
even gave up his role on daytime tv 
and in june rowe returned to the hee haw set in nashville 
at first it was difficult she recalled in an interview in 
her dressing room but people encircled me and treated me so well 
and tried to make me happy 
sam lovullo the producer kept playing jokes on me it was a 
familytype atmosphere it was very nurturing and healing it was 
like having 12 sisters 
as a child rowe was an unlikely candidate for an entertainment 
career that eventually made her a familiar face on tv 
i quit talking for a year when i was 12 because people made 
fun of me she said about her lisp it was torture as a 
teenager 
she took speech therapy and finally corrected the lisp although 
a trace is still evident 
everybody is born with something and it could have been much 
worse she said everybody has something to overcome 
with that problem behind her she went on to hee haw and 200 
other roles on tv usually portraying carefree characters on such 
shows as happy days matt houston airwolf when 
things were rotten fantasy island and love boat 
on happy days she was wendy the rollerskating car hop in 
1974 and 1975 but few viewers knew it was her a lot of people 
have seen it but dont recognize me because i wore a very short 
wig she said 
rowe also has appeared in nine movies including national 
lampoons class reunion and meatballs ii 
she portrayed marilyn monroe in goodbye norma jean 15 
years ago 
she was sweet and beautiful and she was the epitome of what is 
feminine for that time and for today rowe said about the 
fascination with the late sex symbol she had a glow about her 
when she was on camera you wouldnt watch anyone else 
in the 90s we want women to be stronger and to take care of 
themselves but she still represents the beautiful vulnerable 
woman 
on the longrunning hee haw rowe is probably best known for 
a segment in which she sits in a brass bed telling fairy tales 
this evolved into another spot showing her as a teenage baby 
sitter telling the tales 
its nice when i do personal appearances and kids come up to 
me and ask for a bedtime story she said 
the show has given me freedom and a home people recognize me 
from hee haw films come and go but hee haw is sort of 
eternal its been on so long 
her squeaky voice has become a trademark on the syndicated show 
which is in its 23rd season the hourlong program with country 
music interspersed among the humor is seen by millions on 
approximately 220 stations usually early saturday night 
its mine and i have to keep it she said laughing about 
her voice its high a unique experience sometimes when jokes 
dont work they write on the cue card misty squeaks they think 
this saves it or something 
i was once introduced to stevie wonder he couldnt see me but 
he could hear me he said my voice is like little bells it was so 
nice

rose silverman is a florida booster no 
doubt about it 
the 81yearold exercise instructor offers morning aerobics 
classes and encouragement to seniors six days a week in the shade 
of a tileroofed bathhouse on a beach that has drawn tourists for 
decades 
the ocean the climate these were the biggest attractions 
said silverman who retired here in 1967 from new yorks long 
island as you see im very enthusiastic about florida 
but the face of retirement migration is changing and old 
drawing cards like miami beach are no longer guaranteed to be flush 
with retirees 
if you look at the destination of those who actually tend to 
move long distance the sunbelt is still the predominant 
destination said university offlorida geography professor 
stephen golant 
but he believes regional migration patterns through 1985 
indicate new retirees are becoming less likely to pack up and move 
south combine that with a depressionera baby bust about to reach 
retirement age and golant sees change ahead in the sunbelts 
retirement image 
other experts on elderly migration see economic value in 
welcoming the retirees and predict greater competition among 
destinations 
the fact that the retiring cohort is going to be somewhat 
smaller means that theyre going to be fiercely competed for 
said david savageau author of retirement places rated and an 
employee relocation consultant based in gloucester mass the 
losers here maybe they dont think of themselves as losers would 
be archetypal retirement states such as florida 
until recently private enterprise dictated retirement 
destinations with developments and marketing tailored to seniors 
but some states and communities are making retiree recruitment a 
public policy priority convinced of the economic value of 65 to 
75yearold residents savageau said 
offering hot springs ark as an example savageau said 
their identity lies in attracting retired people and attracting 
tourist business 
the same thing can be said for asheville north carolina and 
blacksburg virginia places in the mountains that people would 
just fly over otherwise 
savageau disagrees with golants belief in a migration decline 
i think retirement migration is going to increase even though 
there are fewer numbers of retirement persons he said 
but they both see economic consequences as one older person in 
94 moves to another state based on 1988 census figures 
researchers say that translates to 275000 to 400000 moves a year 
golant sees the primary impacts on housing because the migrants 
need new places to live and on recreation and leisure 
everything from golfing to vacations because they have the 
free time the money and generally good health 
savageau added rankings on employment in the third edition of 
his book after finding a fourth of those who start claiming social 
security still work and an additional half would like to work 
job availability helped propel 12 florida communities into his 
top 1990 rankings texas and arizona have three slots and north 
carolina two in the top 30 
the aging population also will boost spending on everything 
having to do with health care and inhome nursing care which 
could become a political liability by increasing demand on state 
budgets to support medicaid golant said 
regionally he said the northeast and midwest will still of 
course be outmigration areas theres nothing on the horizon 
that suggests more people will move into your new yorks and your 
chicagos 
in the sunbelt golant noted there are an increasing number 
of retirement locales such as the carolinas which would offer 
alternatives to people compared to florida 
savageau believes californians may be ready to jump ship to 
capitalize on their home equity and he is seeing some backlash 
against established retirement havens 
look at these little places like kalispell montana or 
blacksburg virginia he said theyre very nice places sure 
they dont have the yearround climate that san diego might have 
but theyre still an alternative to florida or arizona or south 
texas 
but back at the beach mrs silvermans mind is made up 
i feel those elderly people if they have to go through those 
winters up north with the snow and frost and be indoors with the 
steam heat it definitely shortens their lives she said 
here the pure air and the outdoor living and all the 
activities offered for elderly people there isnt a person who 
wouldnt find something they are interested in you name it its 
all here its here in miami beach

the ohio department of aging wants to find 
out how the older residents are getting along and what the 
government should be doing to help them 
the agency hired the survey research center at the university of 
akron to conduct a telephone poll of people 60 and older about 
4200 residents will be questioned in 25minute interviews in 
january with an additional 1500 polled in a second phase said 
susan lewis chief of the departments division of communications 
results are due in late february and march 
we basically dont have any information beyond the 1980 census 
and its not specific enough to our audience that we need to 
serve ms lewis said 
detailed information from the 1990 census will not be available 
until late 1991 or 1992 
information will be gathered from survey participants about 
health living situation and support they receive specific 
questions still are being drafted 
but ms lewis said respondents likely will be asked about 
whether they have to use a walker or wheelchair whether they can 
drive and how well they see also subjects such as care received 
from children or friends 
federal funds will be used to pay the 145637 cost of the poll 
i see it basically as a planning tool before we go in and 
try to design systems of care for the future to serve the needs of 
the elderly i think the first step is to listen ms lewis said

holiday occasion an unusual cranberry dish is a cranberry salsa to 
spice up any roast turkey ham pork tenderloin

roast for the last halfhour of baking to make a lovely glaze and

magazine columns or trying to rediscover the seeds of lost flowers 
and vegetables 
at headquarters of the national gardening association in 
burlington vt editors are preparing a special seedswap and 
search listing for their magazine this winter they hope in this 
way to clear up a backlog of requests crowded out of regular 
bimonthly editions 
associate editor vicky congdon says a staff horticulturist first 
tries to find the answer to a search inquiry in the associations 
library of hundreds of old catalogs and other sources if he finds 
a source hell contact the inquirer if not the query gets 
printed in the magazine national gardening 
people tend to use the swap column to meet other gardeners 
they establish friendships its a way to get in touch with people 
who are interested in the same hobby said editorial assistant 
diane walker who prepares the popular feature 
she said a woman mourning the death of her husband offered seeds 
of an italian heirloom tomato he used to grow i did not have a 
need to swap but only a need to share the woman said ms 
walker said the response was overwhelming and this tomato 
flourished again in friendly gardens 
the column provides glimpses into the lively diversity of things 
americans are growing some with names you might never see in the 
latest catalogs 
an oklahoman offered seeds of black long bean and purple pod 
pole snap bean red peanut bush dry bean black turtle bush dry 
bean red calico pole lima bean very prolific scarlet runner 
bean clemson spineless okra whippoorwill cowpea and american 
flag leek 
and a californian said he had seeds of cinnamon lemon 
licorice and holy basil mixed aquilegia cosmos cornflower 
bishops lace double larkspur single and double hollyhock single 
and double gloriosa daisy sweet william mixed amaranth and green 
tassel amaranth to trade for heirloom tomatoes beans or any 
perennial good for cut flowers or for any variety of goldenrod or 
a whiteflowered variety 
from hawaii came an offer to swap coral tree seeds for canna 
seeds the coral tree would grow in frostfree areas 
seed swapping has a venerable history in america thomas 
jeffersons garden book is rich with references to seeds he 
received or offered on dec 14 1812 for example he wrote to a 
friend charles clay i do not remember to have seen salsafia 
salsify in your garden and yet it is one of the best roots for 
the winter 
some call it oyster plant because fried in butter it can 
scarcely be distinguished from a fried oyster i send you some 
seed it is to be sowed and managed as carrots and to be taken up 
at the same time and put away for winter use 
in our computer age some gardeners use electronic bulletin 
boards to post their swapping or researching requests answers 
may pop up on their screens the next day or a month later 
contributed by online gardeners using the same network 
much seed swapping of course goes on without recourse to 
magazines or modems gardening being a neighborly pastime a 
frenchman who lives near me introduced me to shallots known as 
frogs legs because of their shape and large size ten years ago a 
barber gave me seeds of a luscious white eggplant he got in sicily 
that barber has since retired but a new barber also a 
gardener promised me a containergrown dwarf fig tree for it i 
swapped some advice on keeping weeds out of an asparagus bed by 
mulching with salt hay

employing older workers does not cost much 
more in health insurance expenses than employing younger ones and 
may actually reduce an employers health insurance costs a study 
says 
it concluded that differences in workers health insurance costs 
among age groups were not great enough to be a major factor in 
employment decisions 
the study commissioned by the american association of retired 
persons compared insurance costs of younger and older workers 
reviewed federal studies and examined data from blue crossblue 
shields federal employee program 
health insurance costs for older workers compared favorably to 
younger workers in part because the older employees generally had 
fewer dependents in addition hospital admission rates and 
lengths of stay have been falling rapidly for older americans it 
said 
the study found instances in which hiring older workers could 
actually reduce employer health costs including 
hiring older single workers the study said the 
highestexpense singleworker group those aged 6064 costs less 
than the lowest expense family group parents aged 25 or younger 
hiring older workers eligible for medicare which will pay most 
of the medical bills for those over 65 
hiring older workers covered by another employer including 
those workers covered in a spouses or other household members

pratt amp whitney forges an alliance 
with germanys daimlerbenz to develop a new generation of 
highthrust jet engines 
general electric co sues claiming the deal violates its 
agreement with daimlerbenz then ge drops the suit and announces 
this fall it is exploring a joint venture with pratt amp whitney to 
develop a supersonic jet engine 
like countries forging alliances against a common foe 
jetengine makers are joining forces in everchanging combinations 
making it almost impossible to know which companies are rivals and 
which are partners 
joint ventures help enginemakers share astronomical development 
costs which results in superior engines by combining the 
technological strengths of various companies and even widen a 
companys customer base by giving it access to a rivals loyal 
customers industry experts say 
things are happening very fast said david vadas an 
economist with the aerospace industries association a 
washingtonbased lobbying group when you have the big boys 
pratt amp whitney ge and rollsroyce going into joint ventures 
there is no turning back 
development of a new jet engine costs between 1 billion to 2 
billion the development costs for the supersonic engine that ge 
and pratt amp whitney are contemplating could reach a staggering 45 
billion 
perhaps 80 percent of jet engines built over the next two 
decades will be produced by international partnerships said mark 
a bobbi an analyst with forecast international in newtown conn 
which follows the aerospace industry that eventually will increase 
to almost 100 percent he said 
the nature of new engines and new aircraft almost dictates it 
because of the costs and risks bobbi said 
sales of commercial engines could amount to between 100 billion 
and 150 billion during the next 15 years bobbi said 
jetengine makers form two basic kinds of alliances the most 
common is known as a risksharing partnership in which a number of 
companies contribute parts technology and financing for an engine 
that bears one companys name 
but several partners also may form an independent company that 
produces its own engines like east hartfordbased international 
aero engines created in 1983 by pratt amp whitney rollsroyce ltd 
of great britain and others 
ge pioneered the trend in 1971 by teaming with snecma a french 
rival to form cfm international cfm produces the highly 
successful cfm56 series for short to mediumrange twin engine 
planes like the boeing 737 
east hartfordbased pratt amp whitney launched its first civilian 
partnership in 1973 teaming with daimlerbenz and fiat aviazione 
of italy to build high thrust engines for widebody jets volvo 
flyg motor of sweden eventually joined the consortium which builds 
the pw2000 series for planes like the boeing 757 
by 1988 janes all the worlds aircraft an industry 
publication listed six major jet engine manufacturing alliances 
pratt amp whitney a division of united technologies corp is 
involved in seven major partnership programs ge is now working on 
at least five jointly produced engines 
an alliance between pratt amp whitney and ge would be the most 
surprising of all the two companies have been slugging it out 
since the 1970s for primacy in the jetengine market 
pratt amp whitney controlled 100 percent of the market until 1970 
but ge is now regarded as the biggest jetengine maker pratt amp 
witney logged 12 billion in orders and options last year vs 
ges 15 billion 
the companies announced in october they were exploring joint 
development of a supersonic jet engine to power planes faster and 
bigger than the frenchbritish concorde powered by an engine built 
by rollsroyce and snecma 
there was no way either company could do it alone from a 
technological or financial viewpoint said donald rudolph 
managing director for development and planning at pratt amp whitney 
everybody recognized it is so big that you need help 
the companies informed the us justice department of their 
plans but said they dont anticipate antitrust problems if the 
deal goes through they will be working together on the supersonic 
engine only and will compete in other areas generally antitrust 
issues dont arise because the partners are from different 
countries 
joint ventures can breed superior engines by combining the best 
technology of the various partners said craig hekking another 
analyst with forecast international 
take the v2500 engine built by international aero engines 
besides pratt amp whitney and rollsroyce iae partners include 
motoren und turbinen union daimlers aerospace division italys 
fiat aviazione and japanese aero engines corp 
the v2500 engine put into service in 1989 is built in modules 
with each partner responsible for a specific section the engines 
are then assembled at pratt amp whitney and rollsroyce plants 
rollsroyce builds the highpressure compressor pratt the 
combustor and highpressure turbine japanese aero engines corp 
contributes the lowpressure compressor system while motoren und 
turbinen union builds the lowpressure turbine fiat aviazione 
builds the gearbox 
enginemakers also dont seem very worried about rivals gaining 
access to their trade secrets 
ge raised the issue in its 12 billion lawsuit against pratt amp 
whitney which it dropped after daimlerbenz agreed to continue 
consulting with ge but on smaller engines but others say most 
enginemakers are roughly equal in terms of technology 
because engines like the v2500 are built in modules a company 
contributing one piece wouldnt know how the other modules are put 
together said nick tomassetti the former iae president who is now 
back at pratt amp whitney 
iae has received 75 billion worth of orders for the v2500 so 
far and expects orders to reach 20 billion by 2004

a federal judge is expected to consolidate 
65000 asbestos claims against eaglepicher industries inc in a 
controversial step toward settling the nations biggest product 
liability issue lawyers said 
but victims attorneys said sunday they would move immediately 
to appeal a classaction order by us district judge jack b 
weinstein and try to block a proposed settlement plan they say 
provides inadequate compensation 
under the proposal eaglepicher would place 625 million over 
20 years into a settlement trust fund that also would contain at 
least 25 percent of eaglepicher stock plaintiffs lawyers said it 
offers too little money and lacks protection should the company 
default or declare bankruptcy 
the cincinnatibased industrial products maker says it faces a 
chapter 11 bankruptcy court filing if no solution to its asbestos 
liability is reached soon eaglepicher has sold off millions of 
dollars in assets to pay claims but says it no longer can meet its 
obligations 
kenneth feinberg a mediator in the case appointed by weinstein 
said he expected the judge to approve a class action as early as 
today and tentatively accept the settlement pending a series of 
hearings on its fairness the hearings are to be held in new york 
cincinnati and another city and last from four to six weeks he 
said 
individuals involved in the case said weinstein also would 
freeze all litigation against eaglepicher and bar the company from 
paying out any asbestos claims pending approval of a final 
settlement 
weinstein wants to create a class action to settle all cases at 
once which would eliminate costly trials that are diverting money 
that could be used to pay victims eaglepichers case likely would 
be used as a model for other companies with large asbestos 
liabilities 
about 90000 asbestos cases clog federal and state court dockets 
nationwide in what legal experts say is the biggest product 
liability issue in us history another key step involves a 
reorganization of the manville trust fund which faces 130000 
claims but has run out of cash that is pending before weinstein 
several plaintiffs lawyers said victims would receive more money 
if eaglepicher reorganizes under federal bankruptcy laws than 
under the proposed settlement they said they would fight 
weinsteins classaction certification in the 2nd us circuit 
court of appeals 
the plan under any kind of objective scrutiny by anybody 
familiar with business or familiar with asbestos litigation is 
grossly unfair to the victims said gene locks a philadelphia 
plaintiffs lawyer 
victims will come out multiples better through a bankruptcy 
reorganization he said 
under the plan eaglepicher would pay 460 million over 20 
years 120 million from operations and 45 million to meet already 
negotiated settlements payments would not begin until november 
1993 at the soonest 
the plan was negotiated and approved by only two of four 
attorneys appointed by weinstein to negotiate with eaglepicher on 
behalf of victims plaintiffs attorneys nationwide met over the 
weekend to plan how to fight weinstein who they said appointed the 
two lawyers in an effort to force through a plan 
attorneys said they would challenge weinsteins authority and 
handling of the case as well as that of the two courtappointed 
victims lawyers who negotiated the settlement who have little 
experience in the 20yearold asbestos litigation 
there is a feeling among some plaintiffs lawyers that the 
judge is not objective and he is so much committed to finding a 
solution to the problem of asbestos litigation that the objective 
that should be there isnt said peter angelos a baltimore 
lawyer who opposes the plan 
lawyers said the law firm of one of the attorneys stanley 
chesley of cincinnati had a conflict of interest because it 
represented owensillinois inc a major asbestos defendant 
company 
chesley said his firm represented owensillinois more than 20 
years ago on a nonasbestos matter and the company was not a 
current client he said his lack of experience in asbestos was 
irrelevant the issue is whats best for the claimants from an 
independent viewpoint chesley said 
current and future claims by victims of lung cancer and other 
respiratory ailments against eaglepicher are estimated at about 
175000 the company has spent 540 million in the last five years 
on asbestos obligations and its future claims are estimated at 600 
million

which owns the sydney morning herald and three other major 
australian publications was placed into receivership monday after 
banks called in outstanding debts

along with rupert murdochs news corp ltd owes about 17 billion 
australian dollars or 131 billion to its creditors

provisional liquidator for the groups finance division after banks 
refused to agree to a rollover of a debt of 850 million australian 
dollars or 654 million 
the deloitte ross tohmatsu accountancy firm was then appointed 
receiver and manager at the request of john fairfax groups banking 
syndicate 
the anz bank and citibank are owed about 12 billion australian 
dollars or 850 million the remaining debt is in the form of 
highyield highrisk bonds 
john fairfax australias oldest media organization also owns 
the australian financial review business review weekly and the 
melbourne age as well as the herald in sydney the herald is the 
oldest englishlanguage newspaper in the world continuously owned 
by the same family

roundtheclock productions in sydney and melbourne the moves came 
amidst a plunge in the value of news corp stock that wiped out 
more than 2 billion australian dollars or 166 billion of the

a third chinese city announced plans monday to 
open a securities exchange as interest in stock and bond markets 
rebounds from a period of official discouragement 
shanghai is scheduled to open chinas first fullfledged 
securities market on dec 19 and the shenzhen special economic 
zone plans to open one next year 
the newcomer is the zhuhai special economic zone located near 
shenzhen in southeastern chinas guangdong province the zones are 
areas that have more freedom than most cities to experiment in 
economic reforms 
zhuhai mayor liang guangda said a task force is preparing to 
open a securities market next year the official china daily 
reported the report indicated the market will focus on stocks 
unlike the upcoming shanghai market that will handle mainly 
government bonds 
the new markets will consolidate transactions currently handled 
by dozens of small unlinked counters in major cities 
liangs announcement reflects the new security market fever 
after more than a year of official coolness toward marketoriented 
reforms in general after crushing a popular democracy movement 
last year the conservative leaders who came to the fore denounced 
capitalist influences on society and the economy 
in recent months however authorities have begun viewing 
securities markets as a useful tool for raising muchneeded 
capital they are most interested in using the markets to sell 
state treasury bonds to help cover a growing budget deficit 
last week the government started up a nationwide computerized 
bonds trading system there has been heavy publicity in the 
official media about the new system and the coming shanghai market 
authorities are less enthusiastic about stocks because they 
transfer ownership of companies from state hands to the private 
sector the government allowed the first stock issue under 
communist rule in 1985 and a brief period of stock fever followed 
but most issues were made available only to employees of the 
companies involved and are not actively traded 
economists recently have revived interest in stocks by 
presenting them as a way of tapping private savings to aid 
industrial expansion and modernization 
the official china daily newspaper last week published an 
argument by a group of economists on behalf of stocks and markets 
the newspaper boldly likened the new interest in all kinds of 
securities to a prairie fire spreading across the country 
irresistable and irreversible

sales of volkswagens new passat model in japan 
have been too low to proceed with plans for nissan motor co to 
begin assembling the cars here next year spokesmen for the two 
companies said monday 
current sales of about 200 a month make the startup costs for 
passat production unreasonable a nissan spokesman said 
unfortunately the sales results arent as high as expected 
we think that if the current sales trend continues theres no 
benefit in producing the car the spokesman said 
through its dealer network nissan is to continue selling 
passats imported from germany volkswagen initially had expected 
sales of about 700 a month for the passat introduced in may as a 
successor to the santana model 
the two companies said their cooperation in other areas such as 
technology would continue 
if in the future something comes up we will be ready to 
negotiate with volkswagen as ever said the nissan spokesman 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
nissan was to have begun assembling knockdown kits of the passat 
next summer as it assembled and sold the santana from 1983 to 1989 
a volkswagen spokesman confirmed low sales were the reason for 
suspending plans for nissan to assemble the passat 
volkswagen imports and markets its other models in japan through 
an independent agent

the small factory floor looked empty beneath 
the hum of 24 electric looms repeatedly the visitors called out 
at last a head of black hair surfaced amid the clattering streams 
of bright white fiber 
to the afghan resistance peter 
tomsen was expected in pakistan on tuesday he was prepared to 
explain any superpower announcement to the afghan guerrillas who 
have been trying since 1978 to overthrow the sovietsupported 
government in kabul the sources said 
we anticipate an announcement its been in the cards for 
sometime it may or may not happen this time were poised but it 
could be another false alarm one diplomat said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the announcement had been expected during last months 
bakershevardnadze talks in geneva but was delayed by differences 
over how to cut off weapons to both warring sides they said 
moscow sent about 115000 troops into afghanistan in december 
1979 to prop up successive communist governments trying to impose 
radical reforms on the largely rural moslem population after the 
red armys pullout in february 1989 moscow continued to pour an 
estimated 2 billion to 3 billion annually in weapons and supplies 
to support troops loyal to president najibullah 
western diplomats and guerrilla leaders once confidently 
measured the survival of najibullahs government in weeks and 
months but the guerrillas were unable to switch from their 
hitandrun tactics to conventional warfare and were rendered 
helpless against the wellequipped and welltrained afghan air 
force 
within months of the soviet withdrawal the anticipated 
guerrilla victory became a costly military stalemate that failed to 
produce a clear victory for either side 
with the guerrillas controlling the countryside and najibullahs 
troops holding the cities the superpowers began searching for 
diplomatic formulas to extricate themselves from a war that has 
left more than 15 million people dead and sent nearly 6 million 
afghans into exile in pakistan and iran 
diplomatic sources say the drafted declaration is purposely 
vague and advocates no concrete peace plan for the afghans 
fiercely independent tribal people who throughout history have 
resisted often violently the tutelage of outsiders the final 
chapter of the war they said will be written by the afghans 
why should the two superpowers involve themselves in such 
details why not leave it to the afghans another diplomat said 
also speaking on condition of anonymity 
pressure has been increasing for both sides to clear afghanistan 
from the superpower agenda before the jan 15 deadline for iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait the source said

veteran cotton ginner wc gunter stood 
in disbelief as he watched over millions of tiny white pillows 
being harvested in the rolling fields of this west texas farming 
town 
the crop wasnt supposed to be there this year gunter said 
mother nature gave us the greatest christmas gift we could ask 
for 
twentyone dry days of above 100 degrees in june had threatened 
most of the 32 million acres of cotton in the 25county region 
which produces a quarter of the nations cotton but sporadic 
rainfall in late july and early august helped the withering plants 
the latesummer moisture combined with a warm dry fall 
revived the crop into what is expected to be one of the strongest 
yields in the last decade 
crop observers are forecasting a total yield of 27 million 
bales in texas which is the nations biggest cotton producer 
thats up 69 percent over last years 16 million bales and 4 
percent above the us department of agricultures october estimate 
of 26 million 
as massive combines traveled row by row gobbling up the cotton 
crop gunter pointed to an acre and predicted it would yield 1 
bales of the fluffy white fiber a few days later he learned the 
acre yielded 2 bales 
its unbelievable said gunter coowner of plainview 400 
cotton gin which expects to clean and press 10000 bales of 
harvested cotton from area farmers five times as much as last 
year 
most all the farmers i talk to in this area are still in 
shock its the best crop i have seen in years gunter said 
you look at an acre and think it will yield a bale and a half and 
then it yields two and a half its just fooling everybody and 
there is no way it should be this good 
i dont think they would have been betting on the success of 
this crop in las vegas agreed cotton agronomist james supak of 
the texas agriculture extension service 
don johnson executive vice president of the plains cotton 
growers said this years yield will be among the strongest of the 
past decade 
a small inventory caused by last years paltry yield has 
strengthened the the market and will drive the value of the 
regions cotton crop this year to more than 850 million experts 
said 
east of san angelo concho valley cotton farmers in a 
threecounty area will produce an estimated 145000 bales valued at 
about 47 million said cotton buyer brent ewald of san angelo 
this is about the biggest crop weve had in 60 to 65 years 
ewald said it is a helluva crop and were going to see bonus 
time around here 
about 60 percent of the cotton being harvested in the concho 
valley already has been purchased ewald said 
but not everyone is celebrating the june drought conditions did 
hurt the harvest in a few areas 
ernest kristinek a dry land cotton farmer in hockley county 
outside of lubbock said he abandoned 350 of his 1250 acres 
because they simply did not get enough water to take root 
kristinek said about 35 percent of the countys 290000 acres of 
cotton were abandoned 
most of the yields are better than everyone thought they were 
going to be he said but we just did not get the weather to 
help us here less than 30 miles away they are whistling dixie 
because they got the rain they needed

security pacific corp said today it will set 
aside 850 million to cover losses on bad loans foreclosed 
commercial real estate and the costs of closing its largely 
unprofitable merchant bank 
the bank holding company the nations fifthlargest said the 
measures would cause a loss of 320 million to 360 million during 
the fourth quarter and reduce profit for the year to 160 million 
to 200 million security pacific earned 741 million in 1989 and 
639 million in 1988 
the los angeles companys announcement follows a series of 
similar actions by big new york banks it was taken in a gloomy 
atmosphere for banks in california where softness in residential 
and commercial real estate has jeopardized what had been a huge 
profit center during the 80s boom years 
despite the actions management expects to recommend that 
security pacific maintain its quarterly dividend of 63 cents per 
share chief executive officer robert h smith said in a statement 
smith said security pacifics core consumer and commercial 
banking operations in california and the pacific northwest and its 
nationwide consumer and business finance companies remain strong 
he said taking the losses and refocussing on core businesses would 
substantially strengthen future profitability 
our objective is to directly focus our strategies and our 
resources on the areas where we can achieve solid profit growth 
smith said the overall strengths of the corporation permit us to 
take these actions at this time 
investors apparently agreed that the moves made sense bidding 
up security pacific stock by 125 to 2325 per share in midday 
trading on the new york stock exchange 
during the first three quarters security pacific already had 
increased its provisions for loan losses by 60 percent over last 
year to 541 million 
the company said it would make 600 million in additional 
loanloss reserves during the fourth quarter it also set aside 50 
million to cover the costs of a speededup program to sell off 
commercial real estate it has been stuck with through foreclosures 
security pacific said it would disband its merchant bank which 
concentrated on lending in the united kindgom and australia the 
unit which also handled commercial and investment banking and 
various securities and currency transactions said it would take a 
charge of about 200 million in the fourth quarter to cover the 
costs of disbanding 
we expect to sell downsize or completely withdraw from many 
of our european and australian activities due to dramatic and 
continuing changes in economic and financial markets smith said 
he said profitable wholesale banking units of the merchant bank 
would be incorporated into other security pacific operations

rather than offering cash incentives on most of 
its vehicles ford motor co will start giving the money to dealers 
and letting them decide how to use it to sell more cars 
ford offers cash rebates of 500 to 1500 on 1990 and 1991 
models or loans with interest rates as low as 48 percent through 
a program that expires tuesday 
under the new program which runs wednesday through feb 28 the 
company will continue to offer 500 to 1000 cash back on a few 
models and loans at 79 percent interest on some vehicles 
but for most cars spokesman david krupp said x number of 
dollars is given to the dealer and he can do with it as he wishes 
he can put some of it into advertising he can give it back to the 
customer or he can keep part of it for profit it gives the dealer 
more flexibility 
krupp wouldnt predict whether the program would allow ford to 
cut back on costly incentives that all three of the nations 
automakers complain severely dent their profits 
robert l rewey vice president for sales operations said the 
company hoped the change would lead to advertising focused more on 
products rather than simply selling the deal 
this new program returns the merchandising responsibility to 
our dealers he said

when 79yearold eishiro saito steps down this week 
as chairman of japans most powerful business lobby his successor 
will inherit a legendary organization but one thats losing its 
luster 
the federation of economic organizations better known as 
keidanren has gained widespread international recognition for the 
huge role it played in bringing japan to its current heights of 
prosperity and economic development 
however its influence has waned in recent years because of 
aging leadership business scandals and a decline in the importance 
of heavy industry that traditionally has dominated the federation 
most observers believe fridays leadership change may mark the 
beginning of a transitional period for the federation although 
they expect no immediate switch in the policies of japans economic 
giants 
the 44yearold keidanren was first regarded as the voice of 
japan inc in the 1950s as one of four large industrial 
federations keidanren helped direct business development and 
ensured support from the government by controlling business 
donations to political parties 
the federation became the overall coordinator and 
fundraiser for the liberal democratic party that has governed 
for 35 years journalist karel van wolferen wrote in his book the 
enigma of japanese power 
keidanren has 938 corporate members including nearly all the 
nations major companies and 121 business associations steel 
makers ship builders and power companies traditionally have 
dominated the leadership 
saito and his successor gaishi hiraiwa are both from this old 
guard saito is honorary chairman of nippon steel corp the 
worlds largest steel maker while hiraiwa is chairman of tokyo 
electric co the worlds largest private electric power producer 
keidanren still is very close to the governing party its 
opinions on everything from trade to us relations to foreign aid 
carry enough clout to draw most foreign business and political 
leaders to the federations somber building on a side street in the 
otemachi business district 
but keidanren has lost some pull in political circles as the 
base of expertise which policy makers depend on for 
information has broadened to include parliamentary committees and 
independent research institutes said kermit l schoenholtz an 
analyst for salomon brothers asia ltd 
a symptom of this loss of influence was seen last spring when 
liberal democratic party officials bypassed the federation and 
collected political donations from companies directly 
japan also has lost the national consensus of the immediate 
postwar years when government industry and most private 
individuals believed all japanese should work together to rebuild 
the business community as a single community is breaking 
down said seichiro yonekura an associate professor of business 
history at hitotsubashi university 
as the main symbol of the tight relations between big business 
and government keidanren has been tarred by recent business 
scandals involving its members some observers say 
keidanren also lost esteem among the public earlier this year 
when saito issued a report opposing proposed land taxes on 
corporations designed to reduce japans outrageously high real 
estate prices a problem that many people have blamed on corporate 
greed 
the image of saito came down as a result yonekura said 
but his image already was hurting during saitos first twoyear 
term which began in 1986 he had been considered a lucky optimist 
exemplified by his philosophy seek for brightness and do not 
look at darkness in photographs he resembled a balding 
bespectacled leprechaun 
but several articles in the local press in the last two years 
criticized him for weakness and lacking a philosophy 
hiraiwa 76 has a reputation for relatively progressive 
thinking although he has not yet articulated a philosophy for 
keidanren a seemingly cheerful man he also is known as 
selfeffacing and patient in part due to his 13year service as a 
federation vice chairman 
compared to saito the new chairman is seen as someone more in 
tune with popular opinion said gregory clark a professor at 
sophia university who studies japans economy 
shijuro ogata deputy governor of the japan development bank 
believes hiraiwa may be in the long run the beginning of a 
transition to younger leadership 
the next leader probably will come from among the federations 
12 vice chairmen who are scheduled for a reshuffling next month 
after selection rules were changed to bring in men younger than 70 
the new officers reportedly will represent industries such as 
services and distribution

they are competitors turned 
confidantes two corporate giants one american one japanese who 
have joined hands here call it a marriage of convenience or call 
it the future of steel 
either way its accurate inland steel co and nippon steel 
corp have formed a 1 billion partnership in these corn fields 
building a 10story 21st century mill that symbolizes the changing 
look of the industry 
big steel in the 90s means big partnerships the united states 
and japan old rivals have become new allies each looking to 
profit as they breathe life into an industry flat on its back for 
much of the last decade 
the japanese are helping rebuild our steel industry and we 
should not be upset by that said richard florida a management 
and public policy professor at carnegie mellon university the 
japanese get access to the american markets americans get the 
technology and good jobs its a winwinwin situation 
its a marriage for money not love 
the japanese have poured about 7 billion into single or joint 
steel ventures almost all in the late 80s florida said 
kawasaki sumitomo kobe and nippon the worlds largest 
steelmaker are putting down roots on the industrial landscape 
welcomed by such american stalwarts as armco ltv usx and inland 
inlandnippons in tek the worlds most modern coldrolling 
steel mill and in kote a galvanizing facility that coats steel 
together have a 1 billion price tag 
the partnerships seem an odd twist considering that imports 
along with the strong dollar and recession contributed to 
americas steel decline in the 1980s japan was the no 1 foreign 
supplier through the decade american companies bitterly complained 
about japanese dumping 
theres a big irony to it said john jacobson of aus 
consultants in suburban philadelphia many of the us companies 
have just had to grin and bear it theyve really had to change 
their perception of the world 
have we given up control certainly he said us 
management does not control its destiny like it used to but its 
destiny wasnt all that good their prospects have improved with 
their investment its better to have half of something good than 
all of something bad 
steel indeed was in crisis in the early to mid80s mills 
closed towns died the work force shrank by hundreds of thousands 
the industry lost 12 billion from 1982 to 1986 though it since 
has rebounded 
it was a fat overweight industry that ran into a wall and 
ended up in the hospital for a few years jacobson said now it 
seems to be back on a better diet slimmed down a little more 
competitive 
the japanese interest is largely spurred by the desire to sell 
steel to the growing number of japanese auto companies in this 
country in tek for example sells to four honda toyota 
chryslermitsubishi suburuisuzu 
these partnerships are just part of a nationwide japanese 
investment explosion some 1100 manufacturing plants with a 
japanese majority interest were established or under construction 
in the united states by the end of 1988 the japan economic 
institute reported last year 
japanese companies have invested more than 25 billion in 
rubber autos auto suppliers and steel florida said 
that way the japanese avoid the expense of building new mills 
alone and reduce political risks by buying off us producers 
who receive both upfront cash and a share of ongoing profits 
said a study cowritten by florida this year 
these investments florida notes also provide a solution to 
trade barriers that limit the amount of steel that can be imported 
the current level is 195 percent of the us market 
still some bemoan the trend 
the japanese look far out into the future said tom jones a 
staff representative for the united steelworkers of america my 
concern is american management is so devoted to immediate 
returns to stockholders or the shortterm bottom line that unless 
were very careful the japanese will simply one day wake up and 
have them all for breakfast 
inland needed help after a disastrous string of years starting 
with 1982s loss of 119 million the first fullyear loss since 
the depression three more bad years followed with losses totaling 
336 million 
by the mid80s about 30 percent of inlands facilities were 
obsolete and the steelmaker was hearing it couldnt match the 
quality of imports said frank luerssen chairman and chief 
executive of inland steel industries inc the parent company 
times were so terrible that inland sold its chicago 
headquarters 
but there was hope nippons chairman already had expressed 
interest in a joint project and as a potential mate the japanese 
company had an attractive dowry lots of money and sophisticated 
technology 
after luerssen saw nippons continuous coldrolling mill turn 
out steel coils faster and smoother than ever during a japan visit 
in 1984 he decided inland needed one to be competitive 
initially the steelmaker planned to buy the technology and 
equipment and own the mill but it was clear it couldnt do that 
financially 
workers knew it too 
we saw the business go away we saw the number of employees 
continue to shrink said paul rausch president of local 9231 at 
in tek who formerly worked at inlands steelmaking plant 
indiana harbor works the labor force at indiana harbor dropped 
from 24500 to 14500 during the last decade 
in 1987 after protracted negotiations the inlandnippon 
partnership was announced inland has 60 percent of the 
partnership nippon 40 percent japanese lenders provided the bulk 
of the money to build the plant which started production this 
spring 
in tek the nations only continuous coldrolling mill uses a 
process that slashes production time from 12 days to less than an 
hour with a third of the workers 
this is the 21st century mill we just built it early said 
george landsly manager of administration 
it is a hightech marvel computer rooms resemble air traffic 
control towers human hands rarely touch steel backbreaking chores 
are performed by machines that look like props from the 
terminator 
and the product is premiumquality steel made from coils an lsqb 
of a inch thick and 65 inches wide that are cleaned compressed 
softened flattened and finished then inspected to meet orders for 
cars appliances and office furniture 
you get a uniform product over and over again landsly said 
its almost like making cookies one at a time or making a batch 
together where they all taste the same

nippons technical competency is about equivalent to the total 
technical effort in the us steel industry luerssen said 
its a substantial leverage for us to have a close association 
the companies also are 5050 partners in in kote two 
galvanizing lines that coat steel to prevent corrosion it will be 
completed in 1991 both ventures will employ about 450 workers 
operating with japanese work methods and team concepts 
the partnership has not been without cultural tensions angry 
calls when japans flag was raised at the harbor works during a 
visit by nippon executives and fears by some inland workers rausch 
said that our japanese partner would come in here and it would 
resemble an old world war ii movie 
instead he said theyve been a good model 
we might traditionally nip at each others heels being union 
and management rausch said the japanese think things through 
and look at it form all different angles and they brainstorm on how 
to resolve an issue that tends to rub off 
i feel very lucky to be here he said its new 
technology it should give me a stable income when i come to work 
i have something to give you cant put a price on that feeling

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher monday on the chicago board of trade amid hopes the united 
states will grant food assistance to the soviet union 
the markets traded within narrow margins on light volume all day 
as traders awaited news from houston where secretary of state 
james baker and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze opened 
two days of talks that were to include a discussion of export 
credit guarantees 
gerald zusel a vice president of edampf man international 
futures inc said traders generally believe the bush 
administration will offer the soviets credits to buy food but the 
question is how much and what will they buy with those credits 
he said the soviets are believed to be seeking 3 billion in 
export credits and the united states is expected to provide no more 
than half that amount 
zusel said the grain markets are just kind of waiting around 
to see what its going to be 
at the close wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 253 a bushel corn was 
1 cent to 2 cents higher with december at 227 a bushel oats

if youve always wanted to ride a train across 
the country but didnt have the time to take it all the way back 
united airlines and amtrak said monday theyve got just the deal 
youve been waiting for 
they unveiled a trainplane ticketing agreement that will offer 
passengers a cheaper fare when they fly one way and ride the rails 
the other way 
the setup would also allow travelers to fly into certain major 
gateway cities then take trains around the region before returning 
to the gateway city to fly home 
longdistance train trips have enormous appeal among 
prospective amtrak passengers but many people lack the vacation 
time for a crosscountry train trip both ways said timothy p 
gardner amtraks vice president of passenger marketing the 
amtrak airrail travel plan will enable travelers to take an 
extended train trip and then fly home 
in the past people who rode the train one way and flew a plane 
the other way got stuck paying full oneway fares but united and 
amtrak said their rates on the new tickets will be roughly 
equivalent to a roundtrip air fare 
amtrak intitiated the deal by approaching united about three 
years ago after determining that uniteds route system is a 
better match with our route system than the other airlines 
amtrak spokeswoman sue martin said 
at least one airline analyst doubted that the trainplane 
arrangement will amount to much more than a marketing gimmick 
i dont think theres a big market for it said raymond e 
neidl of dillon read amp co inc it might generate some marginal 
revenues i dont think its going to be that significant 
neidl said that amtrak service is not widely available outside 
the northeast which limits the value of the package 
amtraks spokeswoman disagreed saying that although cities 
dont have very many departure and arrival times on the national 
railroad a speedy arrival is not the goal of most train travelers 
thats very true in the west where we only have one train a 
day in each direction martin said people dont take the train 
just to get someplace they take the train for the experience of 
riding the train people travel from denver to salt lake city for 
the experience of traveling through the rockies at ground level 
its an experience you dont get from the air 
a washingtonbased group that promotes rail travel as 
environmentally sound was pleased to see the deal come together 
although a spokesman was not familiar enough with travel marketing 
to predict how successful it might be 
i think anything that encourages people to take the train on 
any part of their journey is desirable said scott leonard 
assistant director of the national association of railroad 
passengers leonard said rail transporation is particularly 
important these days because it is energyefficient and could cut 
the nations demand for foreign crude oil 
gardner predicted amtrak will attract thousands of passengers 
through the deal a united spokeswoman sara dornacker said the 
airline would not reveal how much extra business it hopes to pick 
up 
uniteds estimate of passenger volumes through this program 
are significant she said 
to illustrate the savings that passengers could achieve through 
the deal dornacker said the best current oneway air fare from new 
york to los angeles combined with a oneway rail fare would cost 
664 the trainplane ticket would go for 419 for a savings of 37 
percent she said adding that savings would be similar on other 
excursions 
amtrak had previously teamed up with another airline midway to 
let passengers fly into philadelphia then use their same ticket to 
take a train to atlantic city the deal lasted from this past 
spring until fall when midway got out of its philadelphia hub

overseas monday as the federal reserve took no apparent steps to

foreign exchange traders went into mondays session fearing that 
the fed which relaxed its monetary policy on friday would again 
nudge rates downward 
mike faust a foreign exchange analyst with mms international in

would lower the discount rate or take some other aggressive action 
however it never materialized faust said the dollar got 
a temporary reprieve 
on friday the fed announced it was injecting 15 billion into 
the banking system a move designed to encourage banks to make 
funds more available and to allow interest rates to fall the fed 
acted after the labor department issued an employment report that 
showed the economy continued to weaken in november 
the dollar which is supported by higher interest rates fell 
sharply after the feds move when no further steps were taken 
monday the us currency moved higher 
faust said that despite the dollars rise the outlook for the 
us currency remained negative if the economy continues to 
weaken the fed may be forced to relax its policy further

oil prices showed modest gains on the futures 
market monday after settling back from an early rally sparked by 
news that iraq had no plans to leave kuwait 
meanwhile a winter storm in europe and refinery problems in 
saudi arabia helped push up the futures prices of home heating oil 
and unleaded gasoline 
the market lacked the strength to show much of a runup 
however following big losses over the past week and a half that 
have knocked oil prices down to levels not seen since august the 
month iraq invaded kuwait 
people are not that dreadfully bullish said peter beutel 
an oil analyst with pegasus econometric group inc 
light sweet crude oil opened 82 cents per barrel higher at the 
new york mercantile exchange shortly after iraq said it would 
not compromise one iota on its claims to oilrich kuwait crude 
later settled well off its highs at 2690 per barrel up 32 
cents on contracts for delivery in january 
later contract months for crude delivery showed similar modest 
gains 
oil traders said prices were propped up by us and iraqi debate 
over the pending dates of diplomatic meetings intended to bring the 
persian gulf crisis to an end news that those sessions would be 
held had sent oil prices crashing in recent sessions but the 
difficulties in arranging the meetings was having a bullish effect 
home heating oil futures showed the biggest move on the energy 
market rising 180 cents to 8097 cents a gallon on january 
delivery contracts although the swing was not particularly large 
compared with moves in other recent sessions 
prices were bolstered by the arrival of the first winter storm 
in europe and an increase in japanese demand for heating oil 
analysts said 
heating oil prices closed higher for delivery through the later 
winter and spring months but contracts for delivery after that 
fell slightly for the day 
unleaded gasoline prices all closed modestly higher contracts 
for delivery in january were up 126 cents at 6773 cents a gallon 
analysts said the petroleum products were given an early lift on 
news that a saudi arabian refinery had been closed after a small 
fire but the extent of the production problems was not immediately 
clear and the market reaction was mild 
natural gas which is not directly affected by fears of war in 
the middle east was mixed on monday the january delivery contract 
was up 5 cent at 2355 per 1000 cubic feet

the sale of the governmentowned telephone 
monopoly to a consortium including french and american buyers 
raised the prospect monday that it will get easier for mexicans to 
get a phone and that when they do it will work better 
the treasury department on sunday announced that st louisbased 
southwestern bell france cable amp radio and the mexican grupo carso 
had submitted the winning bid of 176 billion for a controlling 
interest in telefonos de mexico 
the sale means it will be possible to improve service notably 
continue expanding the system strengthen research and 
technological development the government newspaper el nacional 
said in an editorial 
the sale was part of the governments program of selling an 
array of unprofitable or nonessential businesses and industries to 
the private sector 
one of the purposes for the sale of telefonos de mexico was 
related to improvement of service an editorial in el universal 
said 
there is a long road to travel but there is no uncertainty 
about the new possibilities of making the advances that should 
occur in telephone modernization it added 
alfredo baranda telmex director said the improvements would 
take time 
the new owners hope that the wait for telephone service can be 
cut to two or three months within the next three or four years he 
told the government news agency notimex 
there are now only 55 million telephone lines in mexico serving 
a population of 81 million people france cable amp radio in 
contrast operates 28 million telephone lines in france 
shortages of lines installation costs line troubles and repair 
delays plague the telmex system 
desperate customers occasionally publish newspaper ads or write 
letters the editor in lastditch attempts to get repairs for lines 
that have been out for months 
although customers may be rejoicing at the prospect of better 
telephone service some telmex employees are unhappy at the 
privatization 
the sale agreement also provides government financing of the 
sale of 44 percent of the stock to company employees over eight 
years a dissident union leader said the privatization was carried 
out without consulting the workers 
more than 500 employees have been fired over the past two years 
and the situation of 3000 operators remains unresolved rigoberto 
barba said 
the governments privatization program is part of a revamping of 
the economy to cut the government debt and attract more foreign 
investment 
acciones y valores de mexico gte of the united states and 
telefonica de espana had offered 169 billion mexicos grupo 
gentor offered nearly 16 billion 
the sale will return telmex to the private sector formed in 
1950 by the merger of companies owned by international telephone 
and telegraph of the united states and im ericsson of sweden 
majority ownership was sold to mexicans in 1958 the government 
took over 51 percent ownership in 1972

security pacific corp said monday it would 
set aside 850 million for bad loans foreclosed real estate and 
restructuring costs a move that will result in a fourthquarter 
loss of up to 360 million 
the los angeles concern the nations fifthlargest bank holding 
company said its profit for the 1990 fiscal year will decline to 
about 160 million compared with 741 million in 1989 
security pacific also said it will eliminate its merchant bank 
which ran into trouble with lending in britain and australia 
the company maintained that its core consumer and commercial 
banking operations in california and the pacific northwest remain 
strong taking losses now and focussing on core business will 
substantially strengthen future profits said chief executive 
robert smith 
the big debtrating services moodys investors service inc and 
standard amp poors corp immediately began reviewing the companys 
debt ratings sampp said major areas of concern were overseas 
operations and deteriorating domestic loans while moodys said its 
review would focus on commercial real estate lending and takeover 
loans 
security pacifics announcement follows similar actions by big 
new york banks in the face of loan defaults a slowing economy and 
declining real estate values 
california banks also face weakening residential and commercial 
real estate markets as well as tougher government demands on 
lenders that have affected banks and thrifts nationwide 
management will recommend that security pacific maintain its 
quarterly dividend of 63 cents per share smith said 
security pacific stock which had fallen by 3 on friday rose 
1 to 23 per share monday on the new york stock exchange as 
investors apparently accepted smiths takeyourmedicinenow 
explanation 
less sanguine was prudential bache securities analyst george 
salem who said he could not understand why the stock rose on the 
bad news 
compared to other california banks security pacifics potential 
problems with real estate loans are high salem said in a telephone 
interview from new york 
their exposure is most heavily oriented to southern 
california which is the weaker part of the california economy 
salem said 
salem recommended that investors dump security pacific and other 
california bank stocks in a recent report that said california home 
resale prices could fall by 25 percent by 1992 new home sales are 
extremely weak and commercial real estate is mired in rising 
vacancies falling rents a credit crunch and shrinking appraisals 
the economic trends for california remain poor salem said 
monday noting that last weeks unemployment figures showed the 
jobless rate for the state rose from 6 percent to 67 percnnt 
security pacific in the first three quarters had increased its 
provisions for loan losses by 60 percent over last year to 541 
million 
it said it would take 600 million in additional loanloss 
reserves during the fourth quarter it also set aside 50 million 
to cover a speededup program to sell off commercial real estate it 
has been stuck with through foreclosures 
security pacifics merchant bank had handled commercial and 
investment banking and various securities and currency transactions 
in more than 20 countries the company said it would take a charge 
of about 200 million in the fourth quarter to cover the costs of 
phasing out that bank 
we expect to sell downsize or completely withdraw from many 
of our european and australian activities due to dramatic and 
continuing changes in economic and financial markets smith said

lone star industries inc a large cement 
company filed monday for reorganization under federal bankruptcy 
law 
the corporation blamed its financial woes on the downturn in the 
construction industry and continued competition with subsidized 
imports 
lone stars board considred two offers from foreign investors 
and other alternatives before concluding it would be best to seek 
bankruptcy protection the company said 
more than twothirds of the cement industry in the united states 
has passed into the hands of foreign investors the company noted 
in its filing in us bankruptcy court in white plains ny 
the corporation listed assets of 1066 billion and liabilities of 
703 million as of oct 31 said company spokesman james a powers 
lone star and a number of its subsidiaries filed for 
reorganization under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act lone 
star said the filing would enable it to continue a program begun in 
1989 to sell off some assets and restructure the company around its 
core business operations of cement aggregate and readymixed 
concrete 
the company took a 250 million writeoff in november 1989 as 
part of its restructuring which included a decision to sell 
marginal cement plants in pryor okla sweetwater texas and 
bonner springs kan the plants are still up for sale 
the remaining operations are located in the northeast and 
midwest 
lone star said its profits have been hurt by foreign concerns 
selling cement in the united states at less than they charge at 
home a practice known as dumping 
the federal government recently found mexican producers guilty 
of dumping 
unfortunately this ruling is several years too late lone 
star said however should other dumpers suffer the same fate 
our business could improve its profitability 
even after restructuring lone star and its affiliates retain a 
98 million ton annual cement manufacturing capacity in the united 
states the company said 
for the ninemonth period ending sept 30 lone star reported a 
net loss of 122 million or 97 cents a share net sales for the 
period were 1906 million and exclude the operations held for 
sale

cereal that cures flab cigarettes that keep 
you slim and an airline fleet as new as its last overhaul are among 
the most deceptive advertising claims of the past year consumer 
groups contended monday 
general motors depiction of itself as a safety pioneer and 
philip morris new image as a champion of the bill of rights also 
won harlan page hubbard lemon awards from assorted consumer 
health and environmental groups 
the annual awards are named for the first advertising 
executive to employ deceptive advertising techniques on a national 
scale according to the center for science in the public 
interest 
hubbard is best known for his efforts on behalf of lydia 
pinkhams vegetable compound a turnofthecentury quack patent 
medicine touted as a cure for complaints ranging from fatigue to 
cancer 
the hubbard spirit is alive and well in the advertising 
community said bruce silverglade legal director of the center 
silverglade and others called on congress to strengthen the 
federal trade commissions power to regulate advertising 
sen joseph lieberman dconn a consumer advocate when he 
served as connecticuts attorney general said consumer groups and 
state attorneys general need ftc help in their efforts to get 
deceptive ads off the air 
as good as all those people are they simply do not have the 
power to cleanse the marketplace of bad advertising lieberman 
said 
the hubbards have been awarded for the past six years to ad 
campaigns branded the most misleading unfair or irresponsible 
by groups familiar with their products 
the 1990 entry into the hubbard hall of shame was a volvo ad 
that showed a volvo standing up to the crushing weight of a truck 
driven over its roof the car had been specially reinforced to 
survive the weight 
robert austin a volvo spokesman said the company never 
intended to mislead the public and was not aware that the car in 
the ad had been reinforced until after the ad aired 
a mistake was made during the production of the commercial 
which compromised its validity austin said we went out and 
told the public that with our own corrective advertisement 
another winner was burger king which advertised a kids 
club as fun nonstop and flashed images of children happily 
involved in what are presumably club activities 
the real club offers only a membership card and some stickers 
said action for childrens television 
burger king spokeswoman cori zywotow said the clubs have 27 
million members who receive a newsletter five times a year and 
special meals at the restaurant 
asked if that counts as fun nonstop she replied we 
stand behind our kids club program and our kids club advertising 
100 percent its been wonderfully successful and lots of fun 
two major companies were cited twice by the watchdog groups 
gm advertised its cutlass supreme model as fuel efficient 
even though it gets lower mileage than most of gms other models 
according to the safe energy communication council 
in addition the center for auto safety said the company 
misrepresented itself by claiming in another ad that it pioneered 
the airbag 
gm removed airbags from its cars after 1976 and fought 
government rules that would have required them it now equips fewer 
models with airbags than ford or chrysler the auto safety center 
said 
philip morris the cigarette maker got a hubbard for a virginia 
slims ad that according to the national womens health network 
implies a brand called superslims can help women stay thin 
philip morris spokesman les zuke called that allegation 
absurd 
superslims he said makes two claims superslims emits 70 
percent less smoke from the lit end and superslims is an ultralight 
cigarette that tastes good 
we have received no calls no letters no inquiries expressing 
confusion by any consumers over this clear and simple message 
zuke said 
philip morris also was cited for its ads championing the bill of 
rights the coalition on smoking or health dismissed the campaign 
as a pr effort to defeat government restrictions on tobacco 
promotion 
gus buenz a spokesman for oldsmobile said gm had airbags in 
cars in 1974 and has a strong tradition of safety research he said 
the cutlass ad was meant to highlight the cars roominess price 
and responsiveness as well as fuel economy 
all were doing is telling people you can get all those things 
plus 30 mpg on the highway buenz said 
other winners included 
pan american airlines for saying its transatlantic fleet is 
among the youngest and by implication the safest in the air 
the airline counted recently overhauled planes as new to arrive at 
that conclusion according to the aviation consumer action project 
kellogg for saying that protein in special k cereal can help 
women maintain healthy muscle tone while dieting the iowa attorney 
general has alleged in federal court that the ads are misleading 
said the center for science in the public interest 
celeste clark vice president of nutrition marketing at kellogg 
said the company stands behind the factual content of its special k 
advertising and has been saying its a highprotein cereal for 35 
years 
we have tried to communicate the contribution special k makes 
to a sensible weight loss plan involving diet and exercise she 
said the campaign is not meant to indicate that special k alone 
can help you lose weight 
coors brewing co for coors light ads that feature a haunted 
house and the line that it isnt halloween without the silver 
bullet its appeal to children is chilling said the national 
council on alcoholism and drug dependence inc 
a company sponsoring fabulous hawaiian sweepstakes a 
telephone ad delivered by an automatic dialing machine the ad is 
really a pitch for a 900toll call that costs 6 and repeats what 
youve already heard said the center for the study of 
commercialism the center said it doesnt know the name of the 
contest sponsor 
there was no immediate comment from other companies contacted

united parcel service reported no 
increase in absenteeism monday the first day of a threatened 
sickout among ups pilots 
the independent pilots association which represents the 
companys 1200 pilots said anonymous letters were sent out 
telling members to call in sick monday through wednesday the union 
responded by sending members a letter saying a sickout was illegal 
and asking pilots to ignore it 
it appears that we may have been able to head this thing 
off said robert m miller president of the union but some of 
our pilots are stating that they dont think we should have stopped 
it 
miller said there was a great deal of frustration among the 
pilots about the slow progress of negotiations for a new contract 
the pilots are working under terms of a teamsters contract that 
expired july 31 
ups said operations were normal monday and the rate of 
absenteeism was normal 
there has been no sign of any job action sickout walkout or 
slowdown and none is expected said ups spokesman bob kenney 
said 
miller and ups officials said they did not know who was 
encouraging pilots to call in sick 
weve had hundreds of phone calls and we said to ignore the 
sickout miller said normally we dont respond to this type of 
thing but we want our position known 
ups pilots transport almost 7 percent of the companys packages 
a widespread sickout would only dent ups total volume but could 
cripple the companys overnight delivery service its fastest 
growing and most profitable division 
ups the worlds largest package delivery service employs about 
237000 people most deliveries are made by truck

american telephone amp telegraph co said monday 
it received more offers of loans from banks than it needs to 
finance its hosile 61 billion takeover of ncr corp 
atampt said more than 50 major us and international banks have 
offered commitments for the 6 billion credit line the phone 
company is establishing in its bid to buy the nations 
fifthlargest computer maker 
atampt said the credit line will back shortterm notes the phone 
company plans to sell to finance part of the ncr bid it also said 
it may draw directly on the credit line for the funding 
atampt met with bankers thursday on the tender offer which it 
announced wednesday 
ncr has said it is not interested in being bought by anyone and 
that it plans to fight the bid 
also monday a federal judge in baltimore dismissed a suit by 
atampt that sought to halt ncr from pursuing tactics to block the 
takeover 
us district judge frederic n smalkin ruled that his court 
does not have jurisdiction in the suit filed wednesday because 
atampt has not actually sought or obtained proxies from ncr 
stockholders 
ncr a marylandchartered corporation is based in dayton ohio 
on friday ncr filed suit in columbus ohio asking a federal judge 
to declare valid a strengthened poison pill antitakeover plan 
endorsed by ncrs board of directors 
the existing poison pill would allow ncr to issue new stock to 
its shareholders at half the price if a company seeking a hostile 
takeover acquired 20 percent of its stock the strengthened plan 
would lower the threshold to 15 percent 
atampt was seeking consolidation of the ohio and maryland suits 
and asking that ncr not be granted approval for its latest 
antitakeover measure atampt also asked that ncr not be allowed to 
resort to two state antitakeover measures the maryland business 
combination act and the control shares act 
atampts lawyers said in court monday that the phone giant is 
contemplating the use of proxies 
in a proxy fight a potential acquiring company seeks to unseat 
the board of directors of the target corporation 
smalkin said atampt must first acquire enough ncr proxies to 
ignite the takeover fight before he could consider legal action

after nearly three years running the largest 
and busiest outpost of the federal agency that keeps wall street 
honest lawrence iason said monday he is stepping down 
iason who took over as head of the securities and exchange 
commissions new york regional office jan 25 1988 told sec 
chairman richard breeden last week he planned to leave government 
service to return to his old law firm 
iasons last day with the sec will be march 15 
ive spent about half my career in government said iason 
who clerked for a federal judge served in the watergate special 
prosecutors office and at the us attorneys office in new york 
during his legal career 
larry has made significant and substantial contributions to 
the new york regional office and to the commission since his 
appointment breeden said in a statement issued by his office 
as head of the regional office iason 45 oversaw a staff of 
250 
the time has come im ready to go back to private practice 
he said in a telephone interview from his office in lower 
manhattan 
iason is leaving government to become a partner at the new york 
firm of morvillo abramowitz and grant otto obermaier the us 
attorney in manhattan is a former partner in the firm 
iason conceded that money was a large factor in his decision 
sec regional chiefs make between 71200 and 83600 a 
significant difference from private practice iason said 
iason who has three young children said i hate to make them 
sacrifice for my benefit 
as head of the new york office iason presided over several key 
investigations one involved the business week insider trading 
cases stemming from marketsensitive information leaked by 
employees of the magazines printers 
another led to an administrative action against the brokerage 
firm donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp that concluded 
with a settlement of more than 56 million for alleged misuse of 
customer accounts 
iason took over an office in disarray after one regional 
administrator left suddenly in 1987 and officials at sec 
headquarters virtually ran the new york office from washington 
william mclucas who heads the secs enforcement division 
remembers the low morale and heavy workload in new york during the 
three months he spent splitting his time between there and 
washington before iason came on board 
i think what you saw was an office that needed some strong 
leadership i thought larry went in and really put the program back 
together said mclucas adding im sorry to see him go i 
think what he did with that office is remarkable 
iason a 1967 yale graduate received his law degree in 1971 at 
new york university

the us dollar opened sharply higher against the 
japanese yen tuesday morning while the key index on the tokyo 
stock exchange sank 
the dollar opened at 13187 yen up 132 yen from mondays close 
of 13055 yen 
the dollars recovery followed its advance in new york overnight 
as the us federal reserve took no apparent steps to push interest 
rates lower dealers said lower rates tend to reduce a currencys 
value 
market players have been expecting the federal reserve to ease 
monetary policy in an effort to revitalize the us economy 
the dollar in tokyo is still rising gradually but it will 
stay in a range somewhere between 1316013230 yen said chizuko 
satsukawa a dealer with chemical bank 
she said dollarselling by exporters is preventing the currency 
from rising above the 13250yen line for now but the yen is 
basically weakening especially toward the end of the year when 
there is a substantial increase in demand for the dollar from 
travelers and trading houses 
more than a million japanese are expected to travel overseas for 
the new year holidays and the majority of them buy dollars for the 
trip 
satsukawa said another factor accelerating the yens decline was 
that japanese investors were buying german marks in anticipation of 
an interest rate increase in germany following a thursday meeting 
of germanys central bank 
on the stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 
30413 points or 128 percent to move to 2348054 within the 
first 15 minutes of trading 
dealers attributed the slide to a weakening yen and 
profittaking following consecutive gains in recent days the index 
has gained nearly 2000 points since wednesday

a federal judge on monday formally consolidated 
65000 asbestos injury claims against eaglepicher industries inc 
in a major step toward resolving a natiowide legal and medical 
crisis 
us district judge jack b weinstein certified a class action 
suit after a daylong hearing on a settlement proposal for 
eaglepicher that faces opposition from nearly all victims 
attorneys involved in the case 
attorneys said they would fight weinsteins consolidation of the 
cases saying the companys 625 million longterm settlement plan 
provides too little money and too few safeguards for victims of 
lung cancer and other respiratory ailments 
weinstein faces an additional roadblock in the formoof a 
petition filed monday in us bankruptcy court in cincinnati 
seeking to force eaglepicher involuntarily into bankruptcy 
proceedings under federal law the bankruptcy petition puts all 
other court action involving the company on hold 
but weinstein said the involuntary bankruptcy filing was 
fradulent on its face and he was moving ahead immediately to 
certify the class action in spite of the bankruptcy petition he 
also froze all litigation involving eaglepicher except to pay 45 
million in previously settled claims 
the cincinnatibased industrial products manufacturer has said 
it would have to seek bankruptcy court refuge if no solution to its 
asbestos problems were reached soon eaglepicher is liable for 
injuries caused by cement products containing asbestos it made from 
1931 to 1971 
the company has spent 540 million in the last five years on the 
issue and faces an estimated 600 million in future claims new 
claims against the company are being filed at an average of 20000 
annually 
eaglepicher chairman thomas petry said he was pleased weinstein 
moved to create the class action he called the involuntary 
bankruptcy petition a desperate attempt to circumvent and 
derail these proceedings 
the motion was filed by three asbestos victims who want 
eaglepicher placed under bankruptcy court supervision on grounds 
the company had failed to meet 19200 in settlement payments the 
company said it had met all obligations to the victims creditors 
lenders and other businesses 
plaintiffs lawyers acknowledged the filing was a strategic 
maneuver to try to block the settlement plan being considered by 
weinstein it would create a trust consisting of cash and company 
stock to compensate workers made sick inhlaing asbestos 
weinstein also appointed former federal judge marvin frankel to 
study whether eaglepicher claimants would receive more money in a 
bankruptcy or through the proposed settlement he also said he 
planned to hold hearings on the fairness of the plan in new york 
cincinnati and detroit 
lawyers complained the judge is forcing a national asbestos 
settlement without their endorsement weinstein wants a national 
plan to avoid long and costly trials that sap money for victims 
some of whom have died before being compensated 
currently more than 90000 asbestos cases clog state and 
federal courts a separate case involves the cashstrapped manville 
trust fund which faces 130000 claims and is being reorganized 
under orders from weinstein 
the plaintiffs have been deprived of an opportunity to be 
heard said ron motley a charleston sc lawyer representing 
several thousand asbestos victims 
we are resigned to the impossibility of getting a fair hearing 
in this court said steven kazan an attorney for the asbestos 
victims of america which has about 18000 members 
only one of three lawyers appointed by weinstein to represent 
current eaglepicher victims has approved the plan and he does not 
have any asbestos clients more than 90 attorneys with 40000 
asbestos clients signed a petition monday opposing the settlement 
plan 
there is a massive lack of confidence in the settlement 
grant hering a new york plaintiffs lawyer told the judge for 
people who are victims who have suffered what they have suffered 
it is a gimmick they cant comprehend 
under the plan eaglepicher would pay 460 million in annual 
payments over 20 years into the trust plus 120 million from the 
companys cash flow it also would contribute 45 million to pay 
settlements already negotiated 
the trust would receive 25 percent of eaglepicher stock and 50 
percent if the company failed to meet its annual payments after 
five years 
in an apparent attempt to quell some of the criticism of the 
plan which was presented to the court last week weinstein 
modified it to grant the trust voting control of eaglepicher if 
the company failed to meet annual payments during the plans first 
five years 
he also said payments should begin by nov 30 1993 regardless 
of delays due to possible court appeals and that victims should 
not lose any rights agreed to in a settlement if eaglepicher 
declared bankruptcy
