so far from god so close to the united 
states 
that lament by a former mexican president porfirio diaz seemed 
to sum up the attitude of many canadians during the recent election 
campaign which featured a national debate of sorts on canadian 
anxieties about the country next door 
americans dont often think about the impact their country has 
across its northern and southern borders but both the canadian 
elections and the inauguration of a new mexican president next week 
have been calling attention to the advantages and adversities of 
geographical intimacy with the united states 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney was on the defensive 
during much of the campaign fending off critics who suggested that 
the uscanada free trade agreement would leave canada as little 
more than an appendage of the united states further robbing his 
countrymen of a national identity 
in the end though a plurality of canadians felt that the 
agreement and its promise of economic boom was too good an 
opportunity to pass up and mulroney and his progressive 
conservatives were returned to office 
as for mexico some argue that having the united states as a 
neighbor is an unmitigated blessing proximity enables mexico to 
send at least part of its surplus population to the united states 
and more than 13 billion worth of exports in most years 
but the united states is of course the country which seized 
half of mexicos territory a century and a half ago and as in 
canada us cultural and economic penetration of mexico sometimes 
creates psychic torment among mexicans 
mexico says assistant secretary of state elliott abrams has a 
fear of being swamped culturally or economically whether you 
consider it real or not its there and its a political factor 
former mexican finance minister jesus silva herzog at a news 
conference wednesday reinforced this thesis when he said he doubted 
that mexico would follow canadas path and negotiate a trade 
agreement with the united states 
we like the english language but only as a second one silva 
said 
the notion that mexico likes to assert its independence by 
staking out antiamerican positions is espoused by former secretary 
of state henry a kissinger who once said that mexico is 
institutionally incapable of embracing any foreign policy position 
to the right of the united states 
thus mexico maintains close ties with cuba and nicaragua the 
principal hemispheric adversaries of the reagan administration 
the objections of many canadians to the united states go beyond 
the fear of creeping assimilation from the south they look on the 
united states as a ar less humane society and that the free trade 
agreement could lead to the dismantling of government social 
programs and a large dispossessed underclass similar to that in the 
united states 
were not antiamerican says rick salutin a toronto 
playwright who campaigned against the trade agreement we just 
dont want to be american salutin obviously does not speak for 
the many other canadians including some of the countrys most 
talented offspring who admire american dynamism and have packed up 
and headed south 
a third us neighbor cuba at times seems to define its own 
existence by trying to be everything that the united states isnt 
according to cuban doctrine the country was a pseudorepublic 
during the years of american imperialist domination 19021958 
and that definitive independence occurred only with the 1959 
revolution 
be happy that youre down here president fidel castro once 
told a gathering in chile you dont know what its like to live 
next to that country

there will be 11 new senators in the 101st 
congress that convenes jan 3 but they soon will find they arent 
all created equal 
republicans who suffered a oneseat loss in this months 
elections and were left at a 5545 disadvantage can take slight 
consolation as the pecking order of the new freshman class falls 
into place when the senate meets to elect its leadership next week 
atop the new seniority list is republican slade gorton who won 
his comeback bid in washington state he takes that spot as the only 
former senator in the incoming class 
the top status will be at least a minimal boost for gorton it 
entitles him to first pick of vacant office suites in the three 
senate office buildings and perhaps a few other perks like a 
coveted hideaway office in the capitol 
in the senate republican conference the party conclave that 
makes committee assignments for gop members gortons prior service 
also will give him a leg up on his freshman colleagues in the class 
of 89 
last on the seniority list will be montana republican conrad 
burns the former farm broadcaster and yellowstone county 
commissioner who ousted incumbent democrat john melcher 
if burns wants to know what to expect he should ask north dakota 
democrat kent conrad who came in dead last in the seniority 
sweepstakes two years ago and wound up with an office off a dank 
stairwell in the farthest corner of the hart senate office building 
republicans also hold the next three positions on the seniority 
list all are lawmakers who are moving from the house to the senate 
trent lott of mississippi jim jeffords of vermont and connie mack 
of florida 
lott ranks first among the three because he is a 16year house 
veteran who rose to the partys no 2 leadership position in the 
chamber jeffords after 14 years in the house ranks next and 
mack a sixyear house member will be next in line of seniority 
in the arcane scheme of things senatorial politicians who have 
been governors get less credit than house members being governor 
isnt legislative experience after all and congress tends to favor 
its own 
things are different over there lott said recently grinning 
and shaking his head after trying to master the details of the 
senate seniority system 
three incoming freshman senators have been governors all 
democrats virginias charles robb robert kerrey of nebraska and 
richard bryan of nevada who will be ranked in that order among 
freshmen with the same qualifications ties are broken by the 
population of the state from which a senator is elected 
bringing up the rear of the seniority list are three new senators 
who have no experience that earns credit in the senate ranking 
scheme again they are ranked by the sizes of their states 
millionaire businessman herb kohl a wisconsin democrat joseph 
lieberman the connecticut attorney general who defeated incumbent 
lowell weicker and montanas burns 
this neat arrangement could all be fouled up however by the 
eleventh new member of the senate the person appointed to replace 
sen dan quayle rind who is leaving the chamber to be vice 
president 
quayle has announced plans to resign sometime before the new 
congress convenes on jan 3 to enable gop indiana gov robert orr 
to select a republican otherwise a new democratic governor will 
take over in indiana and appoint a democrat 
where that person will rank on the seniority list is a topic of 
debate and may have to be resolved by a vote in the republican 
conference he or she could rank first by virtue of being sworn in 
earlier than the others or it could be last because quayle doesnt 
technically become unable to hold his senate seat until jan 20 
inauguration day 
in earlier times an outgoing senator could give his successor a 
seniority boost by resigning a few days early and letting the 
replacement come into office ahead of others in the new group but 
the practice threatened to mushroom out of control and has been 
abandoned by both the gop conference and the democratic caucus the 
other party assembly that makes committee assignments 
if it all seems rather complicated take heart even senate 
insiders disagree on how the whole thing works said one democratic 
leadership official its worse than the family tree folks

guyana a major sugar producer will 
import sugar from mexico for domestic consumption and use its 
stockpile to meet european commitments the government said 
the staterun guyana sugar corp said thursday that extremely low 
production this year forced it to purchase 4000 tons of sugar from 
mexico and scale down its annual sugar harvest target from 210000 
to 170000 tons 
guyana the englishspeaking caribbeans largest sugar producer 
earns most of its foreign exchange from sugar rice and bauxite it 
has never had to import sugar before 
last week the company said it was unable to meet its us quota 
of 10000 tons and asked jamaica and belize to take up the slack 
under a 1984 agreement 
the company said a fourweek strike in january a drought lasting 
until may and periodic work stoppages are to blame for the low 
production

there may be a little less peace on earth for 
smokers in britain this christmas 
the national society of nonsmokers has rewritten five christmas 
carols to give them a seasonal antismoking flavor and it hopes the 
rest of the nation will sing along 
thus o little town of bethlehem has become o little lungs 
of smoking men and we three kings has been transformed from a 
story of the magi to a tale of three representatives of the tobacco 
industry 
to the tune of god rest ye merry gentlemen the society has 
written the ominoussounding lyrics and away in the manger was 
changed to oblivious of danger 
the popular british carol the holly and the ivy became the 
cigarette and cigar 
the tobacco industry calls the idea cheap discreditable and 
offensely irreligious 
its a tatty attempt to involve christmas in an extremist 
pressure group activity said clive turner director of public 
affairs for the tobacco advisory council which represents the 
industry 
i think a lot of people whove got no interest in tobacco 
nonsmokers even some of the people who dont like us would regard 
this as a pretty cheap and tacky little move turner said 
i think its going to offend a lot of people 
but dr penny coyer spokeswoman for the charity that helps 
smokers stub out their fags as cigarettes are known in britain 
calls it a lighthearted and topical way to talk about the 
danger of smoking 
at this time of year those tunes are popular theyre in 
everyones heads and therefore its a way of capitalizing on 
something to put a message across in a lighthearted way she 
said 
theyre not in any sense intended as a stab at smokers theyre 
not intended to be in any sense offensive 
to the tune of we three kings the nonsmokers offer the 
following tale 
we three reps from industry are 
bearing fags cigarettes we travel afar 
to the afflicted and the addicted 
we bring nicotine and tar 
oh tar of cancer tar of death 
tar that gives you filthy breath 
keep on smoking croaking choking 
its much worse than drinking meths spirits 
instead of god rest ye merry gentlemen the revisionists came 
up with 
god rest you merry smoking folk 
does nothing you dismay 
with every single cigarette 
you smoke your lives away 
yet still you puff the noxious stuff 
whatever others say 
does this bring you comfort and joy 
comfort and joy 
does this bring you comfort and joy 
to the tune of o little town of bethlehem the nonsmokers 
wrote 
o little lungs of smoking men 
how ill we see thee lie 
all through your owners fretful sleep 
you wheeze and cough and sigh 
while in your dark interstices 
well hidden out of sight 
if something grows though no one knows 
it may soon come to light 
britain remains a nation of heavy smokers and cartons of 
cigarettes still are considered an appropriate christmas gift more 
than 14 million people 33 percent of the populace are smokers 
the antismoking campaigners have no plans for distributing their 
revised carol book they say they have given them to children who 
have then taken them to school and they hope publicity will prompt 
britons to write in for copies

rapidly multiplying bacteria 
are eating away vivid pictures from the walls of king tuts tomb 
one of egypts mostvisited tourist sites 
specialists have begun applying an antidote they hope can arrest 
the bacteria but antiquities officials say the original color never 
can be restored to the small poxlike black specks and blotches 
marring the walls 
the situation inside the tomb is extremely serious said 
mutawie balboush the egyptian antiquities organizations director 
for upper egypt damage is appearing almost everywhere you look 
among the figures 
at the start of the winter tourist season in early november 
officials were so worried they considered closing the tomb to let 
conservators work unhindered 
after the antidote was developed last week however work to save 
the paintings was scheduled before and after tourist hours 
tutankhamun a young pharaoh who died in 1323 bc was buried in 
a makeshift tomb stuffed with riches in the barren valley of the 
kings the southern wasteland where royalty and nobility were 
buried for 500 years 
during tourist season his singlechambered tomb draws more than 
2500 visitors a day 
its wall paintings some with colors as bright as the day they 
were painted depict noblemen and officials transporting tuts mummy 
to the tomb they include a unique scene of the opening of the 
mouth rite in which the dead king is given eternal life 
we cant simply remove the infection because the bacteria have 
become part of the paint itself said restoration director shawky 
nakhla we have to put the bacteria in a situation that wont 
endanger the tomb itself 
in the past the bacteria were dormant but something has 
triggered them to life when we looked at them in cairo they were 
so active they were duplicating every day 
they found four kinds of bacteria and actinomycetes an 
intermediate step between bacteria and fungi that in humans cause 
abscesses under the skin 
omar arini science officer at the us embassy in cairo said 
bacteria have been present in egyptian tombs since they were sealed 
thousands of years ago 
if something changes the environment inside a tomb such as a 
rise in humidity then bacteria can come to life arini said 
when this happens the situation is extremely dangerous not 
only for the tomb but for others in the vicinity the bacteria can 
spread 
nakhla said bacteria in tuts tomb could have been activated by 
high humidity difficult to control with so many visitors and the 
number of tourists is expected to increase dramatically during peak 
season over the next two months 
though smaller and with lesserquality paintings than some of the 
62 nearby tombs tuts burial place mesmerizes visitors 
it owes part of its allure to the myth of a curse visited on 
anybody who violates it it gained prominence in the 1920s and 
1930s after a number of people from the expedition team that found 
the tomb in 1922 died unusual deaths 
egyptologists scoff at the idea grave robbers violated the tomb 
at least twice in antiquity and egyptologist howard carter the 
expedition leader died naturally in 1939 at age 66

military president augusto pinochet his 
15yearold rule nearing an end is swiftly moving his army back to 
the barracks and away from the political battlefield where he 
suffered a major defeat in october 
political observers and specialists say recent government and 
military appointments by pinochet are aimed at restoring the armys 
professionalism and reaffirming his leadership over the service 
which has served as the backbone of his power since a 1973 coup 
he is trying to preserve the army after the electoral defeat he 
led it into said ricardo lagos a socialist and prominent 
opposition leader 
in an oct 5 referendum chilean voters rejected a proposal by 
gen pinochet and other military commanders that he remain in power 
until 1997 as a result he was obliged to call open elections 
planned for late next year and must hand over power in march 1990 
pinochet is now a dictator with a deadline lagos said he 
suggested that the 72yearold president who is army commander is 
paving the way for his scheduled departure from power in 16 months 
in early november pinochet ordered the largest overhaul in the 
army in 35 years he sent 16 generals into retirement and moved 
other highranking officers from political posts in the government 
back to purely military duties 
among them were several generals and other top officers who 
participated actively in his referendum campaign or were outspoken 
in their support for his continued rule 
the changes while corresponding to the regular yearend 
reorganization of the armys high command were the largest since 
1952 pinochet told reporters during a recent provincial trip that 
the step was part of the transfer from a military government to a 
civilian one 
in yet another indication of his plan to lead the final stretch 
of his lameduck government with minimal military participation 
pinochet reshaped his 16member cabinet only one active military 
officer remained compared to four in his previous cabinet 
in addition in midnovember he appointed seven civilians and 
four retired military men to head 11 of the nations 13 regional 
governments only two activeduty officers stayed on in santiago 
and the extreme southern territory of magallanes previously active 
officers serving as regional government chiefs totaled 12 
augusto varas a sociologist specializing in military affairs 
disagreed with some opposition politicians who saw the changes as 
prompted by pressures on pinochet from within the army 
this should be seen as a decision of pinochet himself varas 
said in an interview these things do not happen against the 
commanders will to the contrary 
varas said he thinks pinochet is trying to protect the 
institution after the defeat because it was too involved in the 
political campaign 
gabriel valdes a centrist opposition leader and a potential 
candidate to succeed pinochet in the 1989 election called the 
changes positive because they show a concern with the armys 
professionalism instead of politics 
varas said this process in the army favors the restoration of 
democracy because it generates a consensus among civilians and the 
military that the armed forces must be dedicated to their 
professional duties not to politics 
he said the process shows that the military have understood the 
tremendous damage it makes to them getting involved in politics 
i think they are leaving power inoculated against future 
political involvement varas said 
he said pinochet by assuming the task of restoring the armys 
professional standards is also seeking to reaffirm his leadership 
of the institution which has about 57000 men and is by far the 
most powerful of the military branches 
but varas and others stressed that the armys discipline and 
loyalty to pinochet remain strong 
according to a 1980 constitution promulgated by his government 
pinochet can remain as army commander for at least four years after 
he leaves power in 1990 he has not stated his plans but varas said 
he thinks he will step down sooner 
he said he believes the process in the army is also having a 
strong impact on the other armed services and encouraging similar 
processes 
the chilean military are estimated to have a combined force of 
100000 men in addition the militarized national police the 
carabineros have 29000 men the carabineros have shared the 
government duties with the other branches under pinochet

the special counsel investigating house speaker 
jim wright has subpoenaed records on work his wife betty did for a 
partnership between wright and a fort worth real estate developer 
and investor according to a source familiar with the case 
the source speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
investigators for outside special counsel richard j phelan had 
subpoenaed and received records of transactions working papers and 
memos related to mrs wrights work for george a mallick 
until 1984 mrs wright was paid 18000 a year for advice that 
she gave to an investment venture formed by the texas congressman 
mallick and their wives in 1979 according to financial disclosure 
statements filed by the speaker 
with the sixmonth ethics probe of wright entering its home 
stretch the investigators are examining transactions underlying the 
partnership company mallightco in much greater detail than 
available in public records the source said 
wrights financial disclosure form shows that he apparently 
exchanged stock worth between 50000 and 100000 for his initial 
share of the partnership which was formed to manage investments in 
stocks real estate and precious and semiprecious stones 
he listed the value of his mallightco holdings which were later 
placed into a blind trust at between 100000 and 250000 the 
trustee disclosed last july two months after the ethics probe 
began that the assets had been disposed of 
wrights investments with mallick are not mentioned in the 
sixcount resolution which spells out the bounds of the 
investigation by the ethics panel formally known as the house 
committee on standards of official conduct 
the complaint against wright involves charges that he improperly 
used his office to lobby federal officials used campaign funds to 
pay for publication of a book on which he received some 55000 in 
royalties and used rentfree a fort worth condominium owned by 
mallicks son 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif declined to comment on 
whether phelan is probing wrights financial dealings with mallick 
or on other matters under investigation but he denied that any such 
scrutiny would amount to an expansion of the investigation 
i am totally satisfied that phelans office has not in any way 
expanded the scope of the preliminary inquiry dixon said i 
cannot comment or explain why a particular issue is relevant to 
the initial six charges 
dixon also said he was not concerned that wrights attorney 
william oldaker also is acting as counsel to others who testified 
before the ethics panel including mallick and carolos moore a 
wright campaign contractor who published the book that is a subject 
of the probe 
oldaker did not return phone calls earlier this week but he told 
the washington post that he represents at least three other 
witnesses in the case he declined to name them but defended the 
practice as ethical so long as each witness is aware of his 
representation of the others 
however wrights chief accuser rep newt gingrich rga said 
in an interview that the multiple representation suggests collusion 
among the witnesses 
if thats not a collusive defense i dont know what is 
gingrich said adding that he had sent a letter to dixon asking if 
the ethics panel had approved the arrangement 
supporters of wright have been complaining in recent weeks that 
the probe which may cost upwards of 800000 has grown far beyond 
its original intent and become a fishing expedition 
they cite trips by attorneys to texas to interview wrights 
political opponents from decades ago and an apparent new look at a 
40yearold unsolved murder case that involved one wright opponent 
wright has said repeatedly that he is confident the probe 
ultimately will find no wrongdoing and aides say the controversy 
will not impede wrights reelection as speaker when leadership 
posts are handed out the week of dec 5 
dixon said he expected the investigators to finish taking 
depositions from witnesses by the end of next week but declined to 
say when a final report might be issued the panel could recommend 
no action or it could file a formal statement of alleged violations 
and hold a disciplinary hearing

as the saying goes some people would 
rather be right than president many missoula county residents would 
rather write than settle for a president 
voters wrote in 1514 names instead of simply checking off the 
candidates listed on the nov 8 ballot said wendy cromwell county 
elections manager 
that number led the state and topped the countys previous record 
of 1044 writeins set in the june primary she said 
writeins included professional politicians such as jesse jackson 
and sen bob dole rkan and sports personalities like chicago 
bulls star michael jordan and the late karate expert bruce lee 
jackson received 54 votes for president and dole chalked up 19 
an oliver northclint eastwood ticket for presidentvice 
president received one vote and someone paired up network news 
anchormen tom brokaw of nbc and dan rather of cbs for the 
presidential ticket 
cromwell attributed the number of writein votes to the ease of 
writing on the countys optic scan ballot and to an editorial in the 
missoulian newspaper recommending writeins in montanas us senate 
race

a newly found mineral has been named for 
him but dont ask lehigh university geology professor charles sclar 
to identify it 
hes never seen sclarite 
sclar was accorded the honor by peter j dunn of the smithsonian 
institution and joel grice of the national museum of natural science 
in ottawa canada 
the two named it after sclar to recognize his years of digging 
for and researching minerals 
i got this letter unsolicited in the mail one day and there it 
was my eyes popped out i had no idea this was going to 
happen sclar said after learning he would be joining an elite 
group of about 15 people a year who have new minerals named after 
them 
sclar and his students during the last 20 years have extensively 
studied the areas zinc ore deposits sclarite he said is similar 
to loseyite another rare zinc carbonate 
the new mineral and its name which was approved by the 
commission on new minerals and mineral names of the international 
mineralogical association earlier this year will be duly recorded 
among the approximately 2500 known mineral species in the glossary 
of mineral species 
sclar said minerals can be named after people or towns but the 
name must have a connection to mineralogy 
you cant name something after your aunt tillie he said

americans might be sitting down for a traditional 
thanksgiving feast of fish or venison if it hadnt been for some 
skillful marketing by turkey producers after the civil war 
there is no rhyme or reason for us to have turkey on 
thanksgiving except that business promoted it said thomas v 
dibacco professor of business history at american universitys 
kogod college of business in washington dc 
then again dibacco said wednesday the history of thanksgiving 
is replete with commercialization by an assortment of innkeepers 
grocers and retailers 
dibacco who has studied the business ties to national holidays 
said the pilgrims who gathered for the first thanksgiving feast in 
1621 in plymouth mass probaby ate fish and venison as the main 
dishes 
the holiday was observed only irregularly in various parts of new 
england until the early 19th century when it became a regional 
fixture he said 
thousands of people would trek to new england in this period 
business played a big role in it the inns and the taverns and the 
sightseeing businesses but it was still a new england affair he 
said 
as the population grew outside new england dibacco said grocers 
and other businessmen looked longingly at the annual tourist exodus 
to new england for thanksgiving celebrations they decided there was 
money to be made in getting people to stay home for a holiday and 
several states were persuaded to declare thanksgiving days of their 
own he said 
in the midst of the civil war and partly as a sign of unity 
president abraham lincoln proclaimed a national day of thanksgiving 
and prayer in 1863 
after the war ended poultry producers in new jersey 
pennsylvania and maryland started pushing turkey as the main dish 
for thanksgiving dibacco said 
turkey was relatively expensive at the time going for about 10 
cents a pound while average wages ran between 10 and 15 cents an 
hour dibacco said that made turkey more profitable to producers 
than chicken 
illustrators of the day picked up the line and started depicting 
pilgrims at the first thanksgiving with sumptuous turkeys and piping 
hot pumpkin pies another anomaly since pumpkins were usually boiled 
in the early 1600s 
the gimmick ultimately worked dibacco said businessmen 
had induced americans to associate the holiday with cuisine that had 
no relation to what you had back in plymouth or new england 
invigorated other businessmen moved in using the holiday to 
blend family values with the christmas shopping season and 
preparations for winter ads counted down the shopping days from 
thanksgiving until christmas and touted the rewards of buying for 
others 
the premise dibacco said was this was a good time for 
planning to buy 
businessmen helped persuade president franklin d roosevelt to 
change the date of thanksgiving in 1939 from the last thursday in 
november to the nexttolast thursday so the christmas buying season 
would be a week longer 
but the change caused some confusion as some americans celebrated 
on both thursdays congress officially made thanskgiving the fourth 
thursday in november starting in 1941 
dibacco said business infleunce is evident in most national 
holidays from the giftgiving at christmas to the flowers and candy 
at mothers day 
we live as much in image as in reality and the image in this 
case is greater than the reality he said

money never made up for christina onassis 
rootless childhood or the loss of the father she idolized it could 
not ease the pain after three members of her family died within two 
years or save any of her four marriages 
the sudden death of christina onassis closes a circle that has 
all the makings of a greek tragedy the daily newspaper 
eleftherotypia said in an obituary it spoke of the tragic fate 
of the onassis family which it described as a dynasty of death 
christina was 37 when she died on saturday during a visit to 
friends in buenos aires friends and relatives said she was happy 
newspapers suggested she had a romantic interest in the brother of 
her hostess 
an autopsy report gave the cause of death as acute pulmonary 
edema accumulation of fluid in the lungs family members discounted 
the possibility of suicide 
a happy person could never commit suicide and christina was 
content and very happy said mary onassis an aunt christina 
was in the best part of her life 
mario falak president of the alvear palace hotel in buenos 
aires said she reserved a suite through dec 4 she had so much 
baggage our employees had to make two trips to the airport 
ioannis georgakis vicepresident of the alexander onassis public 
benefit foundation dismissed suicide reports that arose when 
medicine bottles were found on christinas bedside table 
she had no health problems and it just seems her heart was too 
tired to overcome the attack he said 
greek newspapers quoted friends as saying the bottles probably 
contained diet pills christina experienced wild swings in weight 
throughout her life often caused by alternating crash diets and 
food binges 
she was born dec 11 1950 in new york city and spent her 
childhood shuttling from there to london paris monaco switzerland 
and greece 
the three members of her immediate family died in only two years 
christinas brother alexander was killed in a plane crash in january 
1973 her mother athena died of a heart attack in october 1974 and 
her father aristotle died of bronchial pneumonia in march 1975 
she could never escape the consequences of a rootless 
upbringing according to a aristotle onassis a 1977 biography 
of the greek tycoon never an eager student she learned dancing 
under margot fonteyn and was educated at a series of expensive 
finishing schools she emerged a good linguist but with no sense 
of place 
its authors five investigative reporters on the staff of london 
sunday times described christinas relationship with her father as 
complex and selfcontradictory 
onassis women had to be satisfactory vehicles for 
selfpromotion and adoring females and they had to simultaneously 
accept his engulfing protectiveness and withstand his massive ego 
the biographers wrote 
christina was 25 when her father died and the event had an 
enormous emotional impact news reports said she spent the last two 
weeks by his bedside and had to be sedated for more than two days 
after his death 
the biographers quote her as remarking that she found 
relationships with men difficult because how can i fall in love 
when i have a father like mine 
her love life was as turbulent as her fathers 
she married joseph bolker a los angeles real estate broker in 
1971 and they were divorced nine months later the second marriage 
to greek shipping heir alexandros andreadis lasted only until 1976 
husband number three soviet shipping executive sergei kauzov 
came on the scene in 1978 and departed two years later 
last was theirry roussel a french pharmaceutical heir in 1984 
divorce proceedings followed eight months later they have a 
daughter athena now 3 
aristotle onassis married athena livanos daughter of a wealthy 
greek shipowner in 1946 and she bore him two children alexander in 
1948 and christina 
they separated in 1960 after his highly publicized affair with 
opera star maria callas 
he married jacqueline bouvier kennedy in 1968 and athena later 
became the wife of his business rival shipowner stavros niarchos 
who was married to athenas sister eugenia until her death in 1970 
reports at the time indicated christina and her fathers new wife 
did not get along and the relationship worsened after aristotle 
onassis died 
in april 1975 christina ordered the personal belongings of 
jacqueline onassis removed from skorpios the ionian sea island the 
family had owned since 1963 
the hate that developed between christina and jackie onassis 
determined her future the newspaper eleftherotypia said in its 
obituary 
christina plunged into her fathers business 
for two years she sat behind a desk learning every phase of 
it apostolos zambelas an aide said in a 1983 interview 
he said her business training had begun soon after alexander was 
killed 
alexander was being groomed as the natural heir something 
christina sort of resented zambelas said eventually she got 
more than she bargained for 
her brothers death was a turning point in christinas life 
eleftherotypia said in its obituary they shared the same 
distress over jackie the widow as she called her who 
monopolized their fathers attention 
ta nea another athens paper said alexanders death left her 
inconsolable it was the moment she understood that her apathy was 
over and that she would have to run the fortune 
georgakis the onassis foundation executive said a board of 
trustess will manage the fortune until athena becomes of age

threats of violent resistance 
to even cautious reform of race policies are becoming reality and a 
showdown appears imminent between the government and white 
extremists 
in the latest incident nov 15 a white gunman opened fire on 
blacks at random in downtown pretoria fatally wounding seven 
people authorities arrested barend strydom a 23yearold former 
policeman linked to the neonazi afrikaner resistance movement 
president pw bothas government which warned extremist groups 
previously responded by banning the white liberation movement a 
small group that has held a few public rallies in the past year it 
is the first white extremist group ever banned in south africa 
the white liberation movement advocates clearing out blacks 
living in white urban areas the government described its members as 
fanatical rightwing extremists who favor an active form of 
violence to take racism to its extreme 
johan schabort a biochemist who formed the group in 1985 said 
banning it reduces the outlet for frustration of white south 
africans 
now we cannot control people who are worried about their race 
survival said schabort who claims about 1000 members and many 
more sypathizers 
although no white extremist organizations had been banned the 
government has declared 23 antiapartheid groups illegal and 
detained or restricted hundreds of black activists this year alone 
rightwing white groups have increased in both numbers and 
prominence in recent years as the national party government 
implemented gradual race reforms and proposed limited powersharing 
with blacks 
south africas 26 million blacks have no voice in national 
affairs and the official apartheid policy of race discrimination 
preserves power and privilege for the 5 million whites 
officials did not say why they acted only against the white 
liberation movement which is much smaller than the afrikaner 
resistance movement led by eugene terreblanche 
terreblanche has built his organization into the largest of the 
far right nearly all its members are afrikaners the descendants of 
white settlers who dominate the government 
thousands of rural and bluecollar whites attend the movements 
rallies at which terreblanche delivers spellbinding speeches about 
an allwhite state and rejects any concessions to the black majority 
despite repeated threats the government has not yet acted 
against the afrikaner resistance movement possibly because of worry 
about its vow of violent resistance to any reduction of white 
privilege 
foreign minister rf botha said recently there are whites in 
this country who can put together a more efficient violent 
organization than the african national congress the main 
guerrilla group fighting white domination 
asked why the government does not detain whites as often as black 
antiapartheid activists he said it is not a question of 
arresting a few people and thats the end of it 
the government portrays itself as a haven of stability in the 
increasingly militant struggle by blacks and extremist whites 
about 170 bombings have occurred since a nationwide state of 
emergency was imposed june 12 1986 officials have blamed most of 
them on the african national congress but the targets of several 
recent explosions have been antiapartheid groups 
there should be no doubt that rightwing violence is quite as 
evil and destructive as that of the left the governmentrun south 
african broadcasting corp said in a recent editorial 
black activists have raised the possibility of involvement by 
government security forces in attacks on antiapartheid activists 
and organizations 
after receiving several death threats in march the rev allan 
boesak said many antiapartheid leaders have been assassinated in 
south africa i want the world to know the light of suspicion should 
fall on the south african government and the police if something 
should happen 
police often boast of their success in capturing anc guerrillas 
and preempting their attacks but have announced no progress in 
recent cases of violence widely blamed on white extremists 
among them a bomb destroyed a johannesburg building that housed 
several antiapartheid groups fire damaged offices of 
antiapartheid church groups in pretoria a bomb exploded in a 
johannesburg disco frequented almost exclusively by blacks and a 
fire was set in an antiapartheid groups offices at the university 
of the witwatersrand in johannesburg 
the conservative party which opposes all concessions to blacks 
split from the national party in 1982 and now is the largest 
opposition in parliament some of its parliament members belong to 
the terreblanches organization 
other groups preaching an allwhite homeland are the boerestaat 
party and the orangeworkers 
hercules booysen chairman of the orangeworkers said of the 
action against the white liberation movement the government will 
keep on banning organizations until only itself is left

the federal government plans to require 
automakers to install rearseat shoulder belts in all new cars 
beginning with the 1990 model year 
the announcement wednesday by the transportation department came 
just hours after a private research group the institute for injury 
reduction publicly criticized the department for not requiring 
shoulder restraints in rear seats 
critics for several years have questioned the degree of safety 
provided by belts that fit only across the lap most cars have this 
kind of belt in the rear seat 
benjamin kelley president of the institute said motorists are 
faced with a pick your poison choice because in some types of 
accidents the lap belts provide added protection while in others 
they contribute to the severity of injuries 
the institute was formed by trial lawyers involved in auto 
accident cases 
a national transportation safety board study two years ago said 
that in some cases the laponly belt made some injuries more severe 
because they caused the body to violently jackknife upon impact 
diane steed administrator of the national highway traffic safety 
administration said in a statement that the lap and shoulder belt 
combination in rear seats will be an important safety addition 
provided they are used her agency is part of the transportation 
department 
ms steed also urged motorists whose cars are equipped only with 
lap belts in the rear to use them she said they are effective in 
protecting passengers in a crash especially in preventing the 
injuries and fatalities that occur when people are ejected from 
their vehicle 
the proposed requirement for shoulder belts in rear seats is not 
likely to become final until next year initially it would apply 
only to new cars and does not address the question of retrofitting 
the tens of millions of automobiles now on the road that have 
laponly belts for rearseat passengers 
the rule would apply to small trucks convertibles vans and 
utility vehicles starting with the 1991 model year 
at a news conference wednesday in which it criticized the lack of 
a federal requirement for rearseat shoulder belts the institute 
for injury reduction also charged that the design of many 
shoulderrestraint seat belts is dangerously flawed 
the institute said the window shade belt design used in an 
estimated 120 million cars including virtually all us models 
built since the mid1970s should be altered because it permits the 
belts to be worn too loosely 
the design allows the shoulder restraints to loosen when a car 
occupant shifts forward or sideways automakers say this is 
desireable because it makes the belts more comfortable and thus 
encourages their use 
unless the shoulder restraint is manually retightened with a 
slight tug forward on the belt its effectiveness in a crash may be 
reduced significantly kelley asserted 
spokesmen for the auto manufacturers and federal auto safety 
officials said they are aware that some people may be wearing their 
shoulder belts whether in the front or rear seat too loosely 
thus reducing passengers protection 
but the industry and federal officials defended the belt design 
saying it does not constitute a safety hazard they also argued that 
if the belts were tighter many motorists might not wear them thus 
raising the risk of severe injury or death 
we have no evidence that windowshade belt designs are 
defective or present a safety problem said ms steed 
the concept was to make the belts more user friendly so we 
could get the percentages of belt users up said bill peacock a 
spokesman for ford motor co 
kelley however maintained that a loosely fitted safety belt 
can result in horrendous injuries and that many car occupants 
may not even be aware their belt is too loose

the reagan administration rushing to complete 
its final budget under a compressed time schedule is declaring 
victory in its effort to reduce next years budget deficit by 35 
billion without resorting to new taxes 
joseph wright head of the office of management and budget said 
the administration had reached its goal of cutting the projected 
deficit to 100 billion for the 1990 fiscal year that starts next 
oct 1 
wright said wednesday this would be achieved through a 
combination of asset sales increased user fees cuts in domestic 
programs and approximately 15 billion in savings in such programs 
as medicare farm subsidies and federal pensions 
wright said the administration was on schedule to send congress 
its 1 trillionplus spending plan by jan 9 it will be president 
reagans final budget before he leaves office jan 20 
the 100 billion deficit target for 1990 is established by the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law it compares to a deficit for the 
justcompleted 1988 fiscal year of 1551 billion 
the last of the omb reviews of government agencies budget 
requests was completed wednesday wright said and the agencies will 
now have a little over a week to make any appeals of the decisions 
he said that by dec 2 the administration expects all 
presidential decisions on appeals will be completed meaning that 
with thanksgiving federal agencies are being given just six working 
days to reverse the omb actions 
wright said there had been very little grumbling among cabinet 
secretaries over this shortened time frame which wright said was 
adopted in part to keep reagans final budget from becoming an issue 
in the presidential campaign 
wright said he was anticipating few appeals primarily because 
reagan two weeks ago stressed the need for harmony in order to meet 
the time table 
it is amazing what it does for agency cooperation when the 
president says this is what i want you to do wright said 
the cuts in benefit programs will not reduce any payments to the 
sick or elderly wright said the savings will come in part by 
slowing the rate of increase in payment schedules for doctors and 
hospitals under the medicare program he said 
wright indicated that farm subsidies would also be a principal 
place the administration would look for savings an approach the 
administration has tried before only to run into stiff congressional 
resistance 
the presidents final budget is designed to provide an answer to 
critics who have charged it was impossible to meet the grammrudman 
deficit targets without imposing draconian cuts on domestic programs 
or boosting taxes 
whoever believes you must have a major tax package just hasnt 
gone through a detailed review of all the programs wright said 
the budget will adhere to reagans goals of increasing defense 
spending by 2 percent over the rate of inflation while exempting 
social security from any cuts 
bush has not said whether he will submit his own budget to 
congress or use the reagan budget as the basis for opening 
negotiations but bush has said that whichever approach he takes he 
views cutting the budget deficit as his top priority 
richard darman bushs choice as the new omb director has 
indicated the new administration will also look to the governments 
giant health programs for savings in part because they are growing 
so much faster than inflation 
without some changes medicare the healthinsurance program for 
the elderly is projected to cost the federal government 977 
billion in the 1990 fiscal year that is a 145 percent increase 
from the current fiscal year reflecting growth that is almost four 
times faster than the expected inflation rate 
wright said that while many government programs were being cut 
reagans final budget would propose spending increases in some 
areas in past years reagan has recommended higher spending for the 
war on drugs aids research and the space program

president reagan said he expected to 
be criticized for killing a bill that would have tightened the 
clamps on lobbying by exgovernment officials but he asserted the 
legislation was fundamentally flawed 
in announcing wednesday that he would exercise a pocket veto to 
kill the postemployment restrictions act reagan said i am well 
aware that there will be criticism 
several lawmakers closely involved in drafting the wideranging 
ethics bill immediately denounced the president and the head of 
common cause said the decision sealed an anything goes standard 
of ethics in the reagan administration 
rep barney frank dmass principal sponsor of the house 
version called reagans veto an appalling act of hypocrisy in 
view of vice president george bushs previous presidential campaign 
endorsement of tighter ethics laws 
this is the ultimate triumph of the edwin meese 
ethicsschmethics approach to government in which the rule is that 
whatever makes everyone rich makes them happy frank said in a 
telephone interview from boston 
in a threepage memorandum citing his reasons for allowing the 
bill to lapse and thus die reagan said the nation should embrace 
more clear farreaching restrictions on lobbying by 
exgovernment officials than presently exist but he called the bill 
flawed excessive and discriminatory 
this bill would have begun to make former senior federal 
employees unemployable in the private sector after government 
service he said many of the most talented might never sign up 
to serve their country and the country would be the worse for it 
reagan said the bill was confusing and said that it would have 
imposed a doublestandard in which there would have been greater 
restrictions on postemployment lobbying by executive branch 
employees than by former members of congress 
the bill he refused to sign would have brought former members of 
congress and senior staff aides under lobbying restrictions for the 
first time the president invoked his authority to kill legislation 
by failing to act on it within 10 days from the time he received it 
and during a time when congress is in adjournment 
he would have had to sign the bill by midnight friday for it to 
become law 
the president was remaining secluded at his ranch in the santa 
ynez mountains near here today with plans for a quiet thanksgiving 
dinner with his wife nancy his daughter maureen and her husband 
dennis revell 
among reagans principal stated objections to the ethics bill 
it would have gone beyond existing law to subject former 
executive branch employees to criminal sanctions for activities 
unrelated to genuine ethical concerns 
it would have barred former officials from representing a client 
before any senior federal executive wherever located and no 
matter how unrelated to the former officials government service 
reagan noted that the law would not have taken effect until next 
august well after his term ends but he said it is fundamentally 
flawed and would have made securing good government for america 
substantially more difficult 
reagan urged presidentelect bush and members of congress to 
build upon what he said were some good features in the bill so a new 
version could be considered next year 
but the president didnt escape harsh criticism from capitol hill 
in advance of reagans decision sen george mitchell of maine 
who is campaigning to become the democratic party leader in the 
senate said i would think that after things that have occurred 
in this administration if theres any president that ought to be 
enthusiastic about an ethics bill it ought to be this president 
meese and several other reagan administration officials have had 
ethics problems meese resigned as attorney general although an 
independent counsel concluded an exhaustive probe without 
recommending meeses indictment 
two former toplevel white house aides michael k deaver and 
lyn nofziger have been convicted on charges relating to lobbying 
activities they carried out after leaving the administration 
fred wertheimer president of common cause the selfstyled 
citizens lobby said president reagans veto of the most 
important ethics bill enacted by the 100th congress sealed the 
anything goes ethical legacy of the reagan administration and is 
an ominous sign about the commitment of the incoming bush 
administration to honest and ethical government 
sens carl levin dmich and strom thurmond rsc the two 
chief sponsors of the senate version vowed that they would resume 
their fight for just such an ethics bill when congress returns in 
january 
thurmond said the american people demand and deserve strict 
ethical standards for government officials we may have lost this 
battle but not the war

a former moneyraiser for lyndon h 
larouche jr says he was ordered to get tough with potential 
contributors whether old ladies or unemployed workers because 
the minute you listen to their excuses youre dead 
christian curtis of alexandria va said at the political 
extremists conspiracy trial wednesday that top larouche staffers 
reserved special scorn for those who complained their loans to the 
movement were not repaid 
they were called pigs or swine curtis said as the trial 
finished its third day and recessed until monday 
throughout wednesday jurors heard larouche and his chief 
lieutenants described in most unflattering ways by curtis and former 
larouche security aide charles tate curtis quit the organization in 
may 1986 and tate left two years earlier 
the prosecution fired another salvo by introducing a may 20 
1985 internal memo by a larouche staffer which mocked those lending 
money to the movement 
larouche and six associates are accused in us district court of 
conspiring to defraud lenders by having a policy of not repaying 
more than 30 million in loans 
larouche alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the internal 
revenue service by failing to declare as income the money larouche 
organizations spent for his personal benefit larouche has not filed 
tax returns since 1979 the indictment said 
the defendants contend they intended to pay the loans back but 
ran short of funds after the movement had to spend money to defend 
itself against government and news media attacks 
larouche has denied that the money spent on his behalf was 
income arguing much of it went for security to protect him from 
assassination plots tate who logged many of the alleged threats in 
a file labeled mongoose reports testified such plots were 
products of larouches imagination 
tate said the threetime presidential candidate insulted 
employees lied to them and ordered them around while intoxicated 
i had a lifetime of hatred in that organization tate said 
under sometimes fierce crossexamination from larouche lawyer odin 
anderson the witness denied that he harbored hatred for larouche 
now 
when tate admitted that other larouche staffers often ridiculed 
him anderson said his voice rising now you figure its your 
turn to give it back the remark drew a rebuke from us district 
judge albert v bryan jr 
the 1985 memo on fund raising was written by larouche aide 
franklin harrison bell who said from the witness stand his comments 
about lenders were meant to be humorous 
the memo said there would be four categories to pay back loans to 
larouches campaign organizations if lenders refused to convert the 
loans to gifts 
the hardshipmedical category is not for every lender who 
pulls at your heart strings about needing money to finance the 
opening of his new apple stand wrote bell it is reserved for 
real larouche supporters in dire straits 
the legalsecurity category was reserved for those who 
have active court cases against us or who pose a danger to the 
organization 
the political category is not the dumping ground for those 
phone team contacts who make themselves obnoxious by calling during 
soap opera commercials the memo said it is the reserve of 
supporters who are judged to be people who will continue to back the 
larouche faction 
the final schedule category was for those supporters who 
simply are insistent on getting their monies refunded on a regular 
basis 
bell who still works for larouche disputed prosecution 
contentions that there was a policy not to repay loans there was 
no policy not to repay loans he testified 
curtis the former fundraiser said he was told by superiors 
that solicitors had been too soft in the past 
if youre talking to a little old lady who says shes going to 
lose her house get the money curtis said he was told if 
youre talking to an unemployed worker get the money these people 
are immoral anyway 
the minute you listen to their excuses youre dead he said 
he was told 
larouche was indicted in october on 13 counts of mail fraud 
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the irs 
conviction on all counts could carry a maximum prison term of 65 
years and fines of 325 million 
his six codefendants are charged with conspiracy to commit mail 
fraud and mail fraud and would face lesser sentences if convicted 
the mail fraud charges stem from promissory notes and letters of 
credit sent through the mail by the larouche organization 
larouches codefendants are chief fundraiser william wertz 
legal adviser edward spannaus and former fundraisers michael 
billington dennis small paul greenberg and joyce rubinstein

the state house of representatives is a house 
divided against itself but govelect evan bayh said wednesday it 
will either figure out how to share its power or lawmakers will 
spend thanksgiving in session 
order the turkeys rep robert bischoff said after house 
leaders earlier wednesday reported no progress in resolving the 
deadlock 
for the first time indianas house is split between 50 
republicans and 50 democrats their leaders went back into 
negotiations late wednesday but both sides at first said they were 
deadlocked in dividing power in the chamber 
bayh announced shortly before midnight that the two sides were 
trying to nail down final details on an agreement but the proposal 
whose details were not revealed still had to be endorsed by each 
partys caucus and ratified by the entire house 
from what ive seen over the last 30 hours the people of this 
state have every right to view these proceedings with disappointment 
and alarm said bayh the democratic secretary of state presiding 
over the house organization 
the people of indiana did not vote for chaos they didnt vote 
for gridlock he said they did not vote for a government that 
cant govern itself 
the organization session began tuesday 
then on two roll call votes one tuesday and the other 
wednesday the house split 5050 along party lines in its attempt to 
elect a speaker traditionally the second most powerful position in 
indiana government 
the house adjourned early wednesday morning and appeared headed 
toward a thanksgiving day session after no agreement was reached 
by late wednesday republican candidate paul s mannweiler who 
was house speaker the last two years said he was willing to 
withdraw if his democratic rival michael k phillips of boonville 
would do the same 
the chamber could then turn to an impartial outsider such as 
former indiana university president john ryan to preside over the 
house mannweiler said 
phillips flatly rejected that offer saying he intends to be the 
next speaker 
bayh kept sending the two sides back to the bargaining table 
were not going to go home for thanksgiving if the publics 
business needs to be done said bayh 
the unprecedented split in the house occurred when democrats the 
chambers minority party for 12 years picked up two seats in the 
nov 8 election in which bayh became the first democrat to win the 
indiana governors office in 24 years

turkey convictions and sentences are announced the same day 
demirag fired at ozal twice while the premier was delivering a 
speech to delegates of the governing motherland party one of the 
bullets hit the microphone in front of ozal and the other hit his

from prison in the western city of mugla where he was serving a 
10year term for knifing a man in a coffee house brawl

he acted alone he has said he shot ozal because the premier did not

the gray wolves the militant youth organization of the defunct 
national movement party mehmet ali agca the turkish gunman

presidentelect george bush and his 
wife barbara are spending a quiet thanksgiving here at their family 
vacation retreat after the vice president sought to reassure 
residents of this oceanside community that their lives wont be 
disrupted by his presidency 
barbara and i want to continue to be good neighbors bush 
told several thousand townspeople on wednesday at a rally on the 
village green 
he apologized if his presence and the increased security it 
entailed would tie up traffic in town and make lives for residents 
more difficult because i want to come here a lot as president 
just as he has been doing all his life 
i mean it when i say i dont want to complicate your lives 
bush said 
today the bushes were to have a private turkey dinner with just 
two invited guests two longtime trusted employes don rhodes who 
works for bush in his senate vice presidential office and 
housekeeper paola rendon 
the dinner will be a break from past thanksgivings for the 
bushes when many of their five children and ten grandchildren have 
been present 
but bush aide stephen hart said the bushes were looking forward 
to a private time this year and that other members of the bush 
family all had made separate plans 
the bushes with their spaniel millie in tow flew here on 
wednesday from washington after bush announced that retired air 
force gen brent scowcroft would serve as his national security 
adviser scowcroft held the same job in the ford administration 
when bush headed the cia it was bushs sixth toplevel selection 
praising scowcroft and other members of his emerging cabinet 
bush told the rally here weve hit the ground running were 
putting together a good team 
about half the permanent population of this seacoast town 
responded to invitations from the bushes to attend the festivities 
it was his first time back here since before the republican 
convention last august 
after flying on air force two to pease air force base in nearby 
portsmouth nh bush and his entourage finished the trip by 
helicopter for the first time landing on the grounds of st 
anns episcopal church here where bush had first worshiped as a boy 
on summer sundays with his family 
im wondering what my old man would say if he could see his 
little boy now bush said referring to his late father sen 
prescott bush rconn the vice president recalled he had been 
coming to the family vacation home in every one of his 64 years 
except one during world war ii 
he repeated a campaign pledge to permit lobstermen to continue 
working their traps in the cove alongside his house despite 
security concerns of the secret service 
and he vowed to drive his speedboat slowly in the river that runs 
through town and promised to try not to hold up traffic 
and if we do let me ask you as neighbors to signify your 
displeasure in some other way than those very active hand gestures i 
spot from time to time as we go through town he joked 
i want kennebunkport to retain its magic bush said 
meanwhile efforts by aides to bush and defeated rival 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis to schedule a meeting between the 
two for this weekend fell through on wednesday because of scheduling 
difficulties according to bush sources who insisted upon anonymity 
however such a session is likely to occur in the near future 
the sources said 
in announcing his appointment of scowcroft bush said the retired 
general has made and will continue to make important 
contributions to the design of us foreign policy he praised 
president reagans current national security adviser colin powell 
for an outstanding performance 
bush said he would count on scowcroft 63 to coordinate the 
development of my national security policy 
bush also he still hasnt made up his mind on the choice of a 
defense secretary and said he was sorry if the delay created some 
discomfit for the man most widely speculated to be in line for the 
job former senate armed services chairman john tower rtexas 
i understand the insatiable curiosity about whos going to be 
staffing this administration i understand it but im less tense 
about it than i used to be bush said

tony awardwinning playwright david henry hwang 
hopes to rediscover his musical roots when he teams up with composer 
philip glass to create the voyage a work commissioned by the 
metropolitan opera 
the production is set to be staged in october 1992 to mark the 
500th anniversary of columbuss discovery of america metropolitan 
opera officials say 
this is a collaboration were very excited about bruce 
crawford the mets general manager said tuesday 
we have seen a plot outline which is really more about 
discovery than about columbus and although we have not yet seen any 
of the libretto i dont expect there will be any significant change 
in course crawford said 
the voyage will be hwangs first libretto but he said he has 
a strong musical background that predates his theater work 
im a pretty decent violinist hwang said i was trained as 
a musician before i was interested in any other art and i suppose 
my introduction to the theater was playing violin in a pit 
orchestra 
the production hwangs second collaboration with glass is to be 
directed by david pountney of the english national opera 
hwangs play m butterfly won the tony for best broadway play

a paris court refused a request from the american 
media giant turner broadcasting that a french channel be allowed to 
broadcast the colorized version of john hustons blackandwhite 
classic film the asphalt jungle 
turner broadcasting colorized the 1950 film which was to be 
shown last summer on the private french network channel 5 
in june hustons heirs asked a paris court to ban the film from 
french airwaves arguing that the american director always opposed 
the computer colorization of films that were orginally made in 
blackandwhite 
attorneys representing turner broadcasting argued that the film 
was not the property of huston but of metro goldwyn mayer the film 
studio that paid hustons salary turner acquired the films as part 
of a deal with mgm 
the french court said artistic rights belonged to mgm and huston 
not to turner and issued a restraining order on wednesday 
preventing channel 5 from showing the film

supporters of state lotteries see the games and their burgeoning 
popularity due to multimilliondollar jackpots as a way to increase 
government revenue without raising taxes but critics say the games 
are a bad bet for many people 
in states where lottery revenue goes toward education the 
lottery can stiffen public resistance to paying higher taxes to 
support schools critics say 
they also say lotteries have no impact on the services they were 
designed to finance because the money is used to replace rather 
than supplement other revenue sources 
and a longheld argument against lotteries is that they take 
money from those who can least afford it 
despite the criticism lottery sales are sizzling 
multimilliondollar payouts are so common they hardly make news 
anymore 
in october california gave away a 6198 million jackpot the 
worlds largest lottery prize ever 
lottery ticket sales are expected to reach 14 billion to 15 
billion this year up from 114 billion last year 
and theyll probably rise six new state lotteries are opening 
this year and voters in four other states gave the goahead on 
election day for lotteries already 28 states and washington dc 
have lotteries 
of the 114 billion which excludes commissions to ticket 
sellers about 48 billion went into state coffers and 6 billion 
went back to winners the rest went for administrative costs 
according to the us commerce department some state legislatures 
set a percentage of lottery revenue that must go back to the state 
some permit lottery officials to decide the states cut 
in five states lottery revenue is split among several 
beneficiaries in colorado half the revenue goes to capital 
construction 40 percent pays for conservation and 10 percent for 
parks and recreation 
twelve states put lottery revenue in the states general fund in 
eight states lottery money pays for schoolrelated expenses 
but critics say lottery money has no impact on budgets in most 
states 
in many respects it is inappropriate to say that as the lottery 
goes up education spending goes up said robert h koff dean of 
the school of education at the state university of new york in 
albany 
j blaine lewis jr head of the north american association of 
state and provincial lotteries said it would be a mistake to rely 
on lottery revenue to increase expenditures because lottery sales 
fluctuate what if your lottery goes down 5 percent then you have 
5 percent less than you need he said 
in some states educators object to getting money from a lottery 
based on moral grounds said illinois school boards association 
spokesman jerry glaub 
but california educators have a different objection 
i think california educators would be delighted to have the 
lottery in place had it not undermined other efforts to increase 
funding said james w guthrie a university of california 
professor and head of policy analysis for california education a 
private research organization 
guthrie conceded that state aid to schools has risen in recent 
years but he added its at the local level where school 
districts attempt to pass a bond that we run into the perception 
that the schools arent hurting because of the lottery 
that is a false perception agreed california lottery 
spokeswoman susan kossack the lottery provided over 800 million 
in the 198788 fiscal year for education and thats a lot of 
money but its only 25 percent of the public education budget 
in pennsylvania the lottery pays for programs for the elderly 
shirley sharp spokeswoman for the american association for 
retired persons in pennsylvania said it has worked so well that 
other constituencies are clamoring for a share 
massachusetts has devised a revenuesharing program in which each 
of the states 351 cities and towns gets a portion of lottery 
revenue for discretionary purposes with the amount based on 
population 
people are confident that even if they dont win there is 
still some benefit coming back to their communities said david 
ellis the state lottery spokesman 
one of the oldest arguments against raising money through 
lotteries is that the games are a regressive tax people with the 
lowest incomes contribute the most money 
but ralph batch of the public gaming research institute said that 
theory is not substantiated by 100 surveys besides he said 
when you are buying a lottery ticket on a voluntary basis its 
not a definition of what i know of as a tax

newly harvested rice was offered to the gods on 
japans own labor thanksgiving day an unusual midweek national 
holiday falling on the eve of the day people in the united states 
count their blessings 
wednesdays holiday was intended to reward the japanese for their 
hard work yearround and also to mark the traditional thanksgiving 
for the harvest 
millions of people saw a government broadcast of a featurelength 
cartoon wednesday to encourage the japanese to pay more attention to 
their personal lives in the cartoon workaholic mr uchide ruins 
his health by working 30 years without ever taking sick leave or 
being late for work 
eventually his boss learns he has to allow his employees more 
time for themselves uchide learns to spend more time with his 
family 
the labor ministry commissioned the cartoon to reach the entire 
family in a way that would be easily understood said yasushi 
fukushima manager of the ministrys wage and welfare division 
labor thanksgiving day traditionally a thanksgiving for the rice 
harvest has since world war ii also served as japans labor day 
at the imperial palace 87yearold emperor hirohitos failing 
health prevented him conducting the traditional ceremony called 
niinamesai or feast for the new tasting a palace official said 
ritualists performed it offering newly harvested rice to the gods 
with crown prince akihito and other imperial family members in 
attendance 
japanese work an average 2150 hours a year compared with 1924 
hours in the united states and 1655 hours in west germany 
according to the labor ministry thats 60 more work days a year 
than west germans 
some firms require employees to work as much as 3000 hours a 
year according to the governmentaffiliated leisure development 
center 
japanese rarely take more than a week or two of annual vacation 
fearing it would put too great a burden on their coworkers said 
dr ji shibata a psychologist who cares for people with 
workrelated neuroses 
last year says fukushima only 285 percent of japanese workers 
actually had two days off a week every week in april government 
employees began taking two days off every other week just like 80 
percent of privatesector employees 
in its first revision of the labor standards law in 40 years the 
government in april set an undated goal to shorten the legal work 
week to 40 hours from 48 
it was responding to public pressure to make japan a more 
pleasant place to live the law also is intended to boost economic 
activity through increased leisure spending 
earlier this year takashi ishihara head of the japan 
association of corporate executives urged the government to act to 
translate cashrich japan into a truly affluent society 
the general council of trade unions of japan said 66 percent of 
people it polled felt they work too hard about 40 percent said they 
worked overtime voluntarily for no extra pay 
japans virtual full employment reflects shortages of skilled 
workers in services construction and computer industries 
but younger generations are accustomed to affluence summers 
spent shopping windsurfing and snorkeling vacations abroad as 
they reach adulthood they are challenging the work ethic that has 
made japan an economic powerhouse says social psychologist sumiko 
iwao of keio university in tokyo 
young people are more interested in their own private 
satisfaction or gratification ms iwao said in a recent lecture 
i think that the productivity of the japanese economy will 
decline but i do not think its such a bad thing ms iwao said 
its insane for people to say that their hobby is just work

the lifesaving benefits of quitting cigarettes 
continue well into old age according to a study that found that 
even people in their 70s significantly reduce the risk of heart 
attacks and death when they kick the habit 
the message is that its never too late to quit said bonnie 
hermanson who collaborated with colleagues from the university of 
washington and the mayo clinic in the study older people with 
heart disease have just as much benefit from quitting as younger 
people do 
the study published in todays new england journal of medicine 
disputes the idea that old people have already suffered too much 
damage from smoking to benefit from quitting 
the researchers found that during a sixyear period the death 
rate of older people who continued to smoke was 70 percent higher 
than that of people who had recently stopped smoking 
the study was based on people who already had clogged heart 
arteries a condition that affects an estimated 39 million 
americans over age 54 other research is under way to see if older 
people with healthy hearts also live longer if they stop smoking 
the work was based on men and women older than age 54 who took 
part in the coronary artery surgery study or cass a major review 
of coronary bypass surgery 
cigarette smoking is considered to be the chief avoidable cause 
of death in the united states according to the us centers for 
disease control smoking was responsible for 320515 deaths in 1984 
about onethird of them were smokingrelated fatal heart attacks 
strokes and cardiac arrest 
there is some feeling that its too late for older people to 
quit because they have had too much damage over the years said 
hermanson however there is very little data dealing with elderly 
people most smoking studies are done on those who are middle aged 
or younger 
dr john h holbrook of the university of utah said the study 
shows the advantage of quitting in people whose heart disease has 
been carefully documented 
no matter how old you are no matter how long youve smoked 
theres a benefit to quitting he said and as far as heart 
attack is concerned the benefits begin to accrue within a few 
months 
the risk of lung cancer another major smoking hazard also drops 
when people stop smoking although the reduction is not as fast as 
the fall in heart attacks 
the study was based on a comparison of 807 people who had quit 
smoking within the previous year and 1086 people who continued to 
smoke during six years of followup 210 of the quitters and 391 of 
the continuing smokers died 
the differences cannot be blamed on more severe heart disease 
among those who continued to smoke in fact the quitters were 
actually sicker than the smokers 
dr bernard j gersh a coauthor of the study at the mayo 
clinic said the lower death rate among the quitters resulted 
largely from fewer heart attacks 
among the studys results 
after the researchers adjusted their findings for severity of 
heart disease those who continued to smoke had a 70 percent higher 
risk of death 
thirtyeight percent of the smokers died during the sixyear 
period compared with 28 percent of the quitters 
among those over age 70 50 percent of the quitters died during 
the followup compared with 68 percent of the smokers 
the greatest difference in survival was among those with 
moderate degrees of heart disease 
the benefits of quitting were similar for men and for women 
the advantages of giving up smoking that were seen in older 
people were virtually the same as those in middleaged people 
on the basis of these results the researchers wrote we 
believe that it is worthwhile for physicians to encourage their 
elderly patients with coronary artery disease to quit smoking as 
strongly as they do their younger patients

an ingenious research technique published 
today should aid research into genetic diseases by helping 
scientists produce mice with altered genes scientists say 
the procedure helps scientists select genetically altered cells 
to transplant into a growing mouse embryo an initial step in 
creating the mice researchers said 
while that can be done relatively simply now for a few genes the 
new technique will work with many if not all mouse genes it thus 
expands the usefulness of a recently developed strategy for 
targeting genes for replacement or alteration the researchers said 
such a strategy may be used one day to replace defective genes in 
people said researcher mario capecchi 
the selection technique is described in todays issue of the 
british journal nature by capecchi biology professor at the 
university of utah and member of the howard hughes medical 
institute with colleagues suzanne mansour and kirk thomas 
the procedure is ingenious brigid hogan and karen lyons of 
the vanderbilt university medical school in nashville tenn wrote 
in an accompanying editorial 
in interviews other scientists said alternative techniques also 
are under study and the new procedure may turn out to be preferable 
for only some experiments 
genes are the inherited chemical blueprints that govern the 
structure and functioning of cells they lie along threadlike 
structures called chromosomes 
scientists can alter genes or add new ones by inserting genetic 
material into cells they have recently learned how to aim the 
insertions at particular locations on the chromosome 
but their aim is not perfect leaving them with the problem of 
determining which cells have taken up the insertion in the right 
place and which are carrying it somewhere else researchers want to 
select only the right cells to slip into a mouse embryo 
the key to the new procedure lies in the design of the stretch of 
genetic material to be inserted researchers add two genes to help 
in the later selection process 
one gene makes a cell resist a toxic drug called g418 the other 
gene which makes a cell vulnerable to the drug gancyclovir is 
added in such a way that it will be deleted if the inserted genetic 
material ends up in the correct place on the chromosome 
the selection process begins after researchers insert the genetic 
material into thousands of cells the cells are exposed first to the 
drug g418 and then gancyclovir 
only cells that have taken up the genetic material somewhere in 
their chromosomes will survive exposure to g418 and only cells that 
took it up in the right place will live after being exposed to 
gancyclovir because only they will have removed the vulernability 
gene 
in one experiment only about one in every 2000 cells that took 
up the inserted material had it in the right place but 19 of 24 
cells that survived the selection procedure had it in the right 
place nearly a 2000fold improvement in the concentration of 
useful cells 
alternatives to capecchis technique are under study and the 
choice of which to use in research will probably depend on what a 
scientist seeks to accomplish said alexandra joyner of the mount 
sinai hospital research institute in toronto and raju kucherlapati 
of the university of illinois in chicago 
capecchis method may be best for disabling genes and a different 
method may be preferred for making tiny alterations joyner said

the dollar fell to a record low against the japanese 
yen today and share prices fell after eight straight days of gains 
the dollar closed at 12115 yen down 063 yen from tuesdays 
finish at 12178 yen the currency opened at 12107 yen and ranged 
between 12105 yen and 12128 yen the markets were closed wednesday 
in tokyo for the labor thanksgiving national holiday 
todays closing rate was the lowest since 1973 when japan 
abandoned the bretton woods agreement and began floating the yen 
that agreement implemented at the end of world war ii had fixed 
the exchange rate at 360 yen to the dollar 
the dollar opened lower in tokyo following the currencys 
overnight decline in new york said mitsuhiko kinugasa of daiwa 
bank on wednesday the currency closed at 12125 yen in new york 
trading here just followed what had happened in new york there 
was no major economic factor in tokyo to lower the dollar 
otherwise he said 
currency market sources said the bank of japan has intervened in 
the market trying to save the dollar from further decline the 
central bank routinely refuses comment on its activity 
meanwhile finance minister kiichi miyazawa told reporters today 
that the central banks of major industralized nations including the 
bank of japan will intervene in the currency market when necessary 
to support the us unit 
daiwa banks kinugasa said the dollar recovered slightly when 
investors sold yen as they heard tv news about the emperor 
emperor hirohito 87 who has been bedridden for more than two 
months discharged and vomitted a small amount of blood this 
afternoon for the first time in about two weeks according to the 
imperial household agency 
kinugasa said most market players were sitting inactive because 
there was no trading in the united states due to the thanksgiving 
holiday today 
meanwhile the 225issuenikkei stock average lost 9009 points 
or 031 percent to close at 2934003 on tuesday the index 
reached a record high of 2943012 
share prices fell back in a waitandsee mood following the 
eightday gain said an analyst with nomura securities japans 
largest brokerage 
players were inclined to sell to collect profits after the 
consecutive gains he said speaking anonymously the index has 
become quite high and some participants are getting a little 
cautious about the trend 
in a moderate trading volume on the first section was estimated 
at 900 million shares

the dismissal of a clergy malpractice 
suit brought by relatives of a man who committed suicide after 
pastoral counseling is a deliverance from legal interference in 
spiritual matters church leaders said 
the mans father however called the state supreme court ruling 
a disaster 
the court ruled wednesday that nonprofessional counselors have 
no legal duty to refer a patient to a psychiatrist or take any other 
steps to prevent suicide 
neither the legislature nor the courts have ever imposed a 
legal obligation on persons to take affirmative steps to prevent the 
suicide of one who is not under the care of a physician in a 
hospital said the opinion by chief justice malcolm lucas 
imposing legal responsibilities on pastoral counselors would also 
be impractical and quite possibly unconstitutional because 
those duties would necessarily be intertwined with the religious 
philosophy of the particular denomination lucas said 
this is not a very good day for us said walter nally whose 
24yearold son kenneth killed himself in april 1979 with a 
shotgun blast in fact it is a disaster 
eight years ago nally and his wife maria sued grace community 
church of the valley for 1 million over their sons death in what 
experts in churchstate relations said was the first clergy 
malpractice suit filed in the united states the 10000member 
church in sun valley is the largest protestant church in los angeles 
county 
the nallys lawsuit said the churchs pastors who counseled their 
son for several years knew he was suicidal and should have sent him 
to a psychiatrist the parents also said the churchs method of 
counseling which allegedly stressed sin and guilt worsened his 
depression and helped cause his death 
as evidence the nallys offered a taped statement of one of their 
sons counselors richard thomson made 18 months after kenneths 
death saying that suicide is one of the ways that the lord takes 
home a disobedient believer 
but the court said that statement was irrelevant because there 
was no evidence thomson ever said anything like that to nally 
while referring to nallys death as a profound tragedy lucas 
said the church and its counselors had no duty to nally on which 
to base liability for his unfortunate death 
allowing a lawsuit against an unlicensed counselor for failing to 
refer a client to a psychiatrist on the grounds that the clients 
suicide was foreseeable may stifle all gratuitous or religious 
counseling lucas said 
national religious leaders who had feared the case could lead to 
what they believed was undue interference into the pastoral realm by 
the courts were pleased by the ruling 
anything that has the effect of dismissing this horrible case 
is a deliverance said the rev dean m kelley director of the 
religious and civil liberty office of the national council of 
churches 
dennis kasper an attorney who represented the national 
association of evangelicals said it will reduce the fear of 
being sued that clergy have been feeling lately and free them to be 
more available to people who need their help 
representatives of every protestant denomination filed court 
documents supporting the defendant said attorney samuel ericsson 
executive director of the christian legal society in washington 
if it the ruling had gone the other way the law would drive 
a wedge between those who need help the most and those who stand 
most ready to help said ericsson who represented the church in 
the suit 
john f macarthur jr the pastor of grace community church said 
the ruling will allow the church to carry on with its mission of 
prayerful ministry and spiritual counseling

the indiana house evenly split for the first 
time in history broke a twoday stalemate today by agreeing to 
share power with alternating speakers in whats being called the 
speaker du jour plan 
the agreement greeted by a standing ovation in the house and 
affirmed by party leaders handshake at 210 am also will give 
some powers previously held by the speaker to the chambers 
membership 
the accord was reached under the threat of a thanksgivingday 
session and after two days of closeddoor negotiations between 
republican leader paul s mannweiler democratic leader michael k 
phillips and advisers 
it would let each political party have a speaker who will serve 
on alternate days and give each party a cochairman and equal 
membership on each committee of the 100seat chamber 
democratic govelect evan bayh who in his capacity as secretary 
of state told lawmakers he would keep them in session until they 
broke the impasse applauded the agreement 
i think this is a reasonable outcome given the 5050 split in 
the house said bayh who presided over the houses organization 
session 
mannweiler and phillips are scheduled to be formally named 
cospeakers next wednesday when the house reconvenes to ratify a 
final draft of the agreement the house will return for regular 
business in january 
these are extraordinary times and they require extraordinary 
action said mannweiler who served as house speaker the last two 
years 
if given the opportunity i think it will work he said 
its a whole new system for us 
phillips said the agreement truly returned the power to the 
elected members of this body phillips who had predicted he would 
be the sole speaker said the accord restores fairness and equity to 
a legislative process dominated too long by speakers traditionally 
the states second most powerful position 
the organization session began tuesday 
then on two roll call votes one tuesday and the other 
wednesday the house split along party lines in its attempt to elect 
a speaker 
the house adjourned early wednesday and appeared headed toward a 
thanksgiving day session after no agreement was reached 
order the turkeys rep robert bischoff said at one point 
by late wednesday mannweiler said he was willing to withdraw if 
phillips would 
the chamber could then turn to an impartial outsider such as 
former indiana university president john ryan to preside over the 
house mannweiler said 
phillips flatly rejected that offer saying he intended to be the 
next speaker 
the unprecedented split occurred when democrats the chambers 
minority party for 12 years picked up two seats in the nov 8 
election in which bayh became the first democrat to win the indiana 
governors office in 24 years

the justice minister today 
stayed the execution of a young black man one day after president 
pw botha commuted the death sentences of the sharpeville six in a 
similar politically charged case 
but five convicted murderers were hanged today in nonpolitical 
cases bringing the number of people executed in south africa this 
year to 115 three of them white 
justice minister kobie coetsee granted an indefinite stay to paul 
setlaba hours before he was scheduled to hang this morning the 
independent south africa press association quoted setlabas attorney 
as saying 
the 23yearold setlaba was convicted of murder with two younger 
defendants under the doctrine of common purpose in a 1985 killing 
during a consumer boycott the doctrine allows for the conviction of 
anyone deemed an active participant in a mob that commits murder 
the stay for setlaba came shortly after the un security council 
urged south africa to halt the hanging said united nations 
spokesman francois giuliani in new york he said secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar had earlier made a personal appeal to botha 
for clemency 
the countrys highest court had rejected a lastminute appeal by 
setlaba on wednesday 
the sharpeville six were convicted of a murder that occurred 
during a 1984 riot that marked the start of two years of nationwide 
unrest 
the justice ministry said wednesday that the six blacks five 
men and a woman will serve prison terms ranging from 18 to 25 
years the death sentences in 1985 caused worldwide protest 
bothas commutation of their death sentences came hours after the 
appeal court in bloemfontein the nations highest tribunal 
unanimously rejected a petition to reopen the trial 
the six were convicted of murder in connection with the september 
1984 killing of black town councilor kuzwayo dlamini by a mob in 
sharpeville a township south of johannesburg 
no evidence was presented that they contributed physically to his 
death they were convicted under the common purpose doctrine on 
grounds of being active participants in the mob that killed dlamini 
during rent riots 
the justice ministry gave no reason for the presidents 
commutation and jack viviers a spokesman for botha refused comment 
when reached by the associated press 
also wednesday botha commuted the death sentences of four white 
policemen all of whom had been sentenced to hang for murder 
convictions the justice ministry said they will serve terms 
ranging from 15 years to 25 years 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu suggested today that botha by 
reprieving both the sharpeville six and the white policemen was 
trying to neutralize domestic criticism conservative whites had 
been seeking clemency for the police whose victims were black and 
mixedrace 
the attorney for the sharpeville six prakash diar noted 
wednesday that there had been intense international pressure on 
botha to commute his clients death sentences 
very important heads of state have personally intervened on 
their behalf and i think that has made a difference diar said he 
named president reagan prime minister margaret thatcher of britain 
and chancellor helmut kohl of west germany among those who 
interceded on behalf of the six 
i am happy for my clients that the state president has sought 
to reprieve them but i am astonished at the number of years they 
are going to be spending in prison he added 
hassie mokgesi father of sharpeville six defendant francis 
mokgesi said they should have decided to let the boys come 
home 
antiapartheid groups in south africa international human rights 
organizations and numerous foreign governments had urged botha to 
grant clemency to the sharpeville six 
the sharpeville six are mokgesi 31 reid mokoena 24 oupa 
moses diniso 32 duma joshua khumlao 28 reginald sefatsa 32 and 
theresa ramashamola 27 
the group convicted in 1985 spent 1076 days on death row 
the riots in sharpeville and neighboring townships marked the 
start of more than two years of nationwide black unrest activists 
frequently targeted township councilors for attack saying they were 
collaborators with the whiteled government and its apartheid 
policies of racial segregation 
the five men hanged at pretoria central prison today were three 
of mixed race and two blacks the prison service said 49 death row 
prisoners have been granted reprieves by botha and more than 200 
others still face execution

foreign minister qian qichen will travel to moscow 
dec 1 for the first visit by a chinese foreign minister to the 
soviet union in 31 years the government said today 
the twoday visit for talks with soviet counterpart eduard 
shevardnadze is expected to set the stage for the first 
chinesesoviet summit since nikita khrushchev came to beijing in 
1959 
foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said at a weekly briefing 
that qians talks in moscow will focus on cambodia the main 
stumbling block to improved political ties between china and the 
soviet union 
if the talks between the two foreign ministers on the question 
of kampuchea go well then the sinosoviet meeting of top leaders 
can be held soon ms li said 
china says the soviet union must prod vietnam into withdrawing 
its troops from cambodia before relations can be fully normalized 
moscow is vietnams chief supplier of arms and credit and china 
supports the antivietnam resistance forces in cambodia 
asked whether the kremlins decision to suspend the withdrawal of 
soviet troops from afghanistan could stall plans for a summit ms 
li said only we hope the soviet union will continue to make 
practical efforts in removing the obstacles between china and the 
soviet union 
china has said there are three obstacles to normalized ties the 
soviet occupation of afghanistan soviet military presence along the 
chinese border and cambodia the chinese regard cambodia as the most 
serious 
soviet sources said that after qians trip shevardnadze will 
make a return visit to beijing probably in january or february 
the sources said a visit by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
to beijing for a meeting with senior leader deng xiaoping and other 
chinese top officials could come in the first half of 1989 
china and the soviet union split over ideological and strategic 
differences in 1960 and fought a short border war in 1969 
trade has grown and other contacts have increased since the early 
1980s but china has ignored soviet appeals to end the long 
political freeze 
chou enlai who served as both premier and foreign minister at 
the time was the last chinese senior diplomat to visit moscow in 
1957 andrei gromyko was the last soviet foreign minister in china 
when he accompanied khrushchev in 1959 for communist chinas 10th 
anniversary celebrations 
ms li said the two nations had agreed to exchange foreign 
minister visits in 1986 but that the three obstacles had blocked 
such visits up to now

mrs heffley said wednesday from the hendrick medical center where 
she was recovering from two gunshot wounds 
my god im paralyzed she recalled him saying and he

president roh taewoo is expected to 
appeal to the nation in the next few days to pardon former president 
chun doohwan and end controversy surrounding the exleader 
according to reports today 
government sources who declined to be identified further said 
roh was planning to make an appeal in the coming week to pave the 
way for a pardon for chun the sources said roh hopes to restore 
political calm 
roh to smooth the way for public acceptance of a pardon for 
chun will take unspecified steps to correct wrongs committed under 
the previous government including the forced dismissal of opponents 
and the killing of opposition activists the sources said 
a shakeup of the government and the governing democratic justice 
party is expected in the next few weeks to remove officials 
identified with chun roh reportedly wants to purge all chun 
loyalists and sever connections with the former administration 
the president is expected to try and meet with opposition party 
leaders to seek a compromise over chun opposition leaders say roh 
must resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of the nation 
seoul newspapers carried extensive reports today that roh would 
grant chun a pardon or at least lay the groundwork for amnesty by 
appealing for public mercy president roh recognizing that chuns 
open apology was the best he could do has decided to give him a 
political amnesty the korea times quoted an unidentified 
presidential aide as saying 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in 
1980 went on national television wednesday to apologize for 
corruption and repression under his authoritarian government he 
said he accepted full responsibility for misdeeds under his 
government 
the former president said he was surrendering all his property 
and going into rural exile chun and his wife lee soonja 
immediately left seoul and moved to a buddhist monastery on the east 
coast 
opposition and dissident groups have been calling for a probe to 
reveal the full extent of corruption and human rights abuses under 
the chun government 
top opposition leaders said chuns apology was insufficient and 
demanded a full accounting of misdeeds under his government 
top opposition leader kim daejung contends the chun government 
misappropriated billions of dollars that have not been accounted for 
public reaction to chuns apology was still not clear today 
government officials hope many koreans will accept chuns apology as 
sufficient and allow him to fade into obscurity

aer lingus the national airline today 
denied an american television report that it illegally shipped us 
aircraft parts to iran 
cbs evening news reported wednesday night that a federal 
grand jury is investigating charges that the dublinbased airline 
has sold millions of dollars of parts for c130 hercules transport 
planes to iran since 1981 
a justice department source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
told the associated press that an investigation was under way but 
could not comment on its status 
oisin osiochru an aer lingus senior executive said the airline 
was aware of the investigation 
but he stressed let us knock this c130 thing on the head 
straight off aer lingus does not own or operate c130 aircraft and 
has not supplied parts for c130 aircraft to anybody 
cbs said us customs agents in miami uncovered evidence 
implicating the irish airline this year when they seized evidence 
during an investigation of another aircraft firm 
the parts helped iran keep its c130 fleet built up during years 
of good relations with the united states in good condition for the 
war with iraq cbs said 
selling usmade parts for the planes which are used for many 
purposes including supplying troops and refueling jet fighters in 
flight was made illegal after iran seized us hostages at the 
tehran embassy in 1979 
cbs quoted law enforcement sources as saying aer lingus made a 
huge profit by ordering parts for its own civilian version of the 
c130 and then illegally shipping them through a subsidiary company 
from london to iran until 1987 
osiochru said that from 1980 to the beginning of 1985 when all 
contracts were terminated aer lingus supplied spare parts and small 
components for civilian aircraft to iranian carriers 
we supply spare parts only for aircraft we know something about 
and the c130 is not one of those osiochru said 
the aircraft for which we supplied spare parts were 
predominately boeing aircraft say of the boeing 747 type they were 
civilian aircraft 
aer lingus was a very minor participant in the supply of 
maintenance services to iran in circumstances where there was all 
the appearance of tolerance by the united states of that 
situation he said 
under those circumstances we really cannot see why this should 
be regarded as a very big deal 
us regulations were tightened at the end of 1984 and when 
that was brought to the attention of senior management in aer 
lingus a decision was taken to end the contract osiochru said 
if charged with illegally shipping the parts and then convicted 
aer lingus faces several million dollars in fines 
cbs reported that although an indictment is expected the state 
department has expressed some reservations about bringing charges 
against the national airline of a close ally

left leg in nablus openair market hospital officials said

ramallah was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the 
stomach the doctors said 
a military spokeswoman said she was checking the reports 
also today assailants broke into a mosque in the west banks 
kalandia refugee camp smashing windows destroying religious tapes 
and ripping up holy books a resident said 1500 was missing 
a police spokesman said an investigation indicated the motive was 
criminal because the money and two tape recorders were stolen 
palestinian residents blamed israeli security forces but conceded 
there were no witnesses 
our suspicion is that local people from the camp broke into the 
mosque to take money and valuables said a west bank police 
spokesman mordechai bareket during their search things fell but 
there was no intention to damage its an entirely criminal 
matter 
in the occupied gaza strip meanwhile troops opened fire on 
stonethrowing youths in the shati refugee camp killing 40yearold

of her death were unclear 
officials at mukassad hospital in jerusalem said marwan kneiry 
27 of the west bank village of yaabad died wednesday after being 
brought to the hospital nov 7 with a concussion and bruises his 
family told doctors kneiry had been beaten by soldiers 
the two deaths raised to 317 the number of palestinians killed in 
the 11month arab uprising against israels 21year occupation of 
the west bank and gaza strip eleven israelis have also died 
the hebrewlanguage haaretz newspaper said that six palestinian 
prisoners were wounded last week during a riot that broke out in the 
desert ketziot prison where some 2500 arabs are being held 
army spokesman lt col hanan rubin in charge of the southern 
command denied anyone was wounded in the prison but did not 
specifically deny the riot the haaretz report did not describe how 
the prisoners were wounded 
haaretz also said authorities were using prison loudspeakers to 
broadcast hebrew songs throughout the prison grounds in an attempt 
to drown out nationalistic palestinian songs chanted by prisoners 
a military spokeswoman in jerusalem said prison guards had only 
blasted one hebrew song over loudspeakers and discontinued the 
practice after three minutes because it had not been approved by 
commanders 
most of the inmates in the desert prison are palestinians held 
without trial or charges under emergency laws established by the 
british when they ruled palestine in the 1940s the laws are kept in 
use by israel 
also today the army lifted curfews that confined residents to 
their homes wednesday in two gaza strip refugee camps and a gaza 
city neighborhood but the military maintained a curfew on the west 
bank elamari refugee camp for the fourth day in a row 
the 15 million palestinians in west bank and gaza which israel 
seized in the 1967 middle east war have been revolting since dec 8 
against israeli military rule

iraq and iran exchanged 71 prisoners of war 
today the first day of a red crosssponsored operation to 
repatriate more than 1500 sick and disabled prisoners from the 
persian gulf war iraqi officials said 
red cross officials earlier had said 151 prisoners 110 iraqis 
and 41 iranians were to be freed but only 52 iraqi pows left 
tehran aboard a dc9 jet chartered by the international committee 
for the red cross 
in response iraq returned only 19 iranians aboard the same 
plane which is to shuttle between the two capitals on a daily basis 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia cyprus said fewer iraqis flew to baghdad because some had 
asked for political asylum 
others were no longer eligible for repatriation after red cross 
doctors verified they had recovered from their illness the news 
agency said 
each departing prisoner was given a copy of the koran the holy 
book of islam and persian craftwork as gifts the news agency said 
the dc9 was to fly between tehran and baghdad for the next 10 
days to repatriate up to 1115 iraqis and 411 iranians all sick or 
wounded according to a memorandum of understanding signed by iraq 
and iran with the red cross 
the repatriation which is being paid for by an unidentified 
western nation is the largest prisoner exchange so far between the 
countries who agreed aug 20 to a ceasefire in their eightyear 
war irna said 
the last pow exchange of 25 iraqis and 25 iranians took place 
oct 30 as a mutual goodwill gesture before unmediated iraniraq 
peace talks resumed in geneva the talks have made no progess 
a red cross official in baghdad paul henri morard said the 
plane would fly the shortest route between tehran and baghdad 
despite the ceasefire many planes still avoid flying directly over 
the joint border 
the red cross proposed to start the exchange nov 20 but it was 
twice postponed because some prisoners on both sides were unwilling 
to return home and sought to go elsewhere according to diplomatic 
sources in baghdad 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said a number of 
prisoners asked to leave for an unidentified western country 
in addition some iranian prisoners want to join the mujahedeen 
khalq the iraqbased opposition group that seeks to overthrow the 
government of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the sources said 
morard said the red cross has already registered 50182 iraqi 
pows and 19284 iranians but the total number of pows estimated by 
both countries is 100000 he said the red cross has repatriated 765 
iraqi sick and wounded pows and 613 iranians since 1981 
as signatories of the geneva convention both sides are pledged 
to repatriate all pows without delay after cessation of 
hostilities the sick and wounded should have been returned while 
the fighting was still in progress according to the convention

miklos nemeth a 40yearold 
westernoriented economist was elected hungarys new premier today 
succeeding communist party leader karoly grosz as the head of 
government 
nemeth who faces the tough task of implementing unpopular 
austerity measures and sweeping reforms to boost the stagnating 
economy faced some opposition in hungarys increasingly outspoken 
parliament 
on wednesday he won the unanimous approval of the communist 
partys policysetting central committee todays ballot on nemeth 
was delayed by objections from one of hungarys most outspoken 
parliamentary deputies zoltan kiraly who was expelled from the 
communist party last spring 
kiraly said parliament should have a much fuller debate on the 
choice for premier and hold the discussion only after it hearing a 
report from leading reformer imre pozsgay on plans for changes in 
hungarys political institutions 
pozsgay a politburo member and minister of state on wednesday 
billed his report as the governments package plan for democracy 
in the end kiralys objections to the agenda were overruled but 
45 of parliaments 383 deputies voted for his proposals and six 
abstained 
in the vote on nemeth 27 deputies voted against the new premier 
and 36 abstained the state news agency mti said 
reszo nyers the father of hungarys innovative economic reforms 
in the 1960s also won parliamentary approval today in the newly 
created post of minister of state for economics fifteen deputies 
voted against him and another 15 abstained mti said 
gyoergy fejti a central committee secretary told journalists 
wednesday that the two men combined pragmatism with experience 
nemeth is expected to continue the stabilization program of 
economic reform that grosz began when he became premier in june 1987 
grosz announced his intention to resign the government post last 
month complying with his promise not to keep both jobs beyond the 
end of the year 
grosz made no secret of his preference for nemeth as his 
successor the front page of the independent weekly reform showed a 
picture of grosz with the caption my choice would be nemeth 
nyers also had been high in the running for his new post 
according to communist party sources parliamentary deputies and 
central committee members were surveyed before the final decison was 
taken 
nemeth who spent a year at harvard university on a visitors 
program sees the introduction of a marketstyle economy as the only 
way of pulling hungary out of economic stagnation 
in the november issue of the party monthly social review he 
described the present economy as deformed and called for a mixed 
economy that would use capital and labor efficiently 
in vain we have tried to cram practice into theoretical 
schemes he wrote suggesting that a system of leasing branch 
offices of large companies could constitute a sort of school for 
enterprise 
nemeth a pragmatic technocrat like grosz also sees the need for 
a reform of political institutions to coincide with restructuring 
the economy 
in his article widely seen as an unofficial government program 
he recognized the need to acquire the support of society

military sales program the united states plans to require countries 
buying arms with us money and their american suppliers to 
agree first to cooperate with federal investigators the new york

who bribed foreign officials set up dummy corporations submitted 
false invoices and diverted us aid to secret foreign bank accounts 
from which it could not be recovered the times said 
under the new rules foreign governments buying arms with 
american loans would have to agree in advance to make their records 
and files available to federal investigators the times reported 
likewise american companies that want to sell weapons to a 
foreign government receiving american loans would have to give 
investigators access to their records

and unnecessary lobbyists for arms exporters also expressed concern

exports and security assistance told the times these rules could 
impose an enormous unnecessary administrative burden 
they are designed to make life easy for prosecutors they are 
not likely to deter fraud above and beyond the current

contractors from lt gen charles w brown director of the defense 
security assistance agency and his deputy glenn a rudd the times

gunmen killed 17 people and wounded 
at least 12 when they opened fire on mountain villagers attending 
evening prayers in a private chapel the military said today 
the regional military commander brig gen jesus hermosa said 
the communist new peoples army launched the attack because the 
villagers refused to pay revolutionary taxes but a survivor 
said governmentbacked vigilantes had accused villagers of being 
rebel sympathizers 
a wealthy landowner who survived the attack said she believed she 
was the target because of jealousy and a military officer who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said the military was hunting an 
unidentified relative of the woman 
the dead included four children and two elderly women officials 
and survivors said a hospital spokesman said five of the wounded 
were in critical condition 
the military also reported today that 31 other people were killed 
in scattered clashes nationwide between government troops and 
communist rebels and between soldiers and moslem rebels during the 
past three days 
survivors of the chapel massacre said the gunmen some of whom 
were wearing fatigues arrived tuesday evening in the remote 
mountain village of bagtik about 340 miles southeast of manila on 
cebu island 
one of the survivors lolita gitgit 28 said most villagers were 
in the roman catholic chapel praying the rosary when they heard dogs 
barking several men left the service and tried to drive off the 
gunmen with stones but they were all mowed down she said 
the gunmen then sprayed the chapel and an adjacent residence of a 
wealthy landowner and chapel owner cresencia hermosilia who was 
among the wounded survivors said 
roldan mangubat a member of the provincial advisory board 
quoted mrs hermosilia as saying she received a threat from an 
undisclosed group not to go ahead with a village festival held the 
day before the attack because it was too extravagant 
there were many of them said jose canelio 27 who was 
inside the chapel when the firing began the shooting continued 
for a long time maybe 20 minutes when the shooting ended and we 
got up they were gone many of us were dead there was much 
moaning 
canelio said he and others made their way to nearby villages to 
seek help officials in cebu city heard of the attack only today 
because bagtik is about a twohour walk from the nearest road and 
has no telephones 
the wounded were taken to the nearest town asturias and 
transferred early today to a hospital in cebu city about 40 miles 
from bagtik 
another survivor mercedita bitoon 23 told reporters that a few 
days ago a member of an undisclosed vigilante group threatened the 
villagers and accused them of communist sympathies 
the area is a stronghold of a militant farmer organization which 
vigilantes claim is a communist front 
hundreds of vigilante organizations operate in the philippines 
and have been organized by the military to help fight the 19year 
communist insurgency 
amnesty international and other human rights groups have accused 
the vigilantes of widespread abuses of civil liberties 
two weeks ago hundreds of area residents fled to cebu city 
claiming they were being harassed by soldiers and vigilantes they 
have been receiving food and shelter from local civilian officials

police station in benburb 35 miles west of belfast was unstaffed 
and locked up for the night during wednesday nights car bomb attack 
no security forces personnel were injured 
police said the explosion extensively damaged the police station 
and up to 12 nearby homes it was the latest in a string of botched 
ira attacks that have killed at least 19 civilians in the last year 
and forced the ira to issue repeated apologies 
the police press officer who declined to be identified said the 
bomb was concealed in a van left near the police station it 
exploded as barney lavery and his granddaughter emma donnelly both 
from prominent local catholic families drove past the station 
the two had given a ride to an elderly woman and dropped her off 
moments before the bomb exploded at 1050 pm hurling their car 
into a field 
the press officer said the guerrillas gave police two telephone 
warnings but that there were no security forces in the area to 
clear it before the bomb exploded 
the ira would know full well that the police station was 
unmanned at that time he said 
a catholic priest the rev matt mulroe gave the churchs last 
rites to the two victims as they lay in the wrecked car 
the eight injured civilians were taken to south tyrone hospital 
in the town of dungannon about five miles away police said the most 
seriously hurt had a broken arm 
they said four of the eight were hospitalized the rest treated 
and released 
police said the van was stolen they said the family that owned 
it was held at gunpoint while the van was driven to its target the 
family was later released unharmed 
on tuesday night guerrillas fired a rocketpropelled grenade at 
two police jeeps at castlewellan 25 miles south of belfast but 
missed and demolished a butcher shop 
the sovietmade rpg7 antitank rocket narrowly missed a crowded 
pub 
benburb is eight miles from the village of loughgall where last 
year police and troops lying in ambush after a tipoff killed eight 
ira guerrillas as they bombed the local police station 
the worst bungled attack occurred in november last year when an 
ira bomb killed 11 protestant men women and children at a memorial 
service for the dead of two world wars at enniskillen 70 miles west 
of belfast the bombing intended for british soldiers created a 
wave of antiira revulsion around the world the ira admitted it had 
made a grave error

several jewish leaders who met new hampshire gov 
john sununu said the meeting left them reassured that the future 
white house chief of staff is a strong supporter of israel 
it was a soothing meeting in terms of the anxieties we had 
going in seymour reich president of bnai brith international 
said after wednesdays luncheon attended by about 30 jewish leaders 
last week several jewish groups had expressed concern because 
sununu was the only governor in the nation to refuse to sign a 
proclamation condemning a 1975 united nations resolution that 
equated zionism with racism 
at wednesdays meeting sununu reiterated that he had refused to 
sign the proclamation because he felt it was wrong for a governor to 
make pronouncements on foreign policy he also repeated that he 
opposed the un resolution 
sununu in an interview published today in the union leader of 
manchester nh said he told the jewish leaders he had thought his 
statements against the un resolution were equivalent to 
signing a proclamation and obviously i have learned it wasnt 
sununu said he would like to think he now has jewish leaders 
confidence he said he told them if there are issues we have to 
talk about lets get together and talk about them i assured them 
of accessibility 
he said he realizes it is a very diverse community but you 
have to come with a perspective that is somewhat unified dont 
expect me to handle 40 different inputs and in a solomonlike way 
identify what the consensus ought to be 
the host of the luncheon jacob stein said sununu also said he 
was committed to the integrity and security of the state of 
israel 
sununu assured the jewish leaders that the bush administration 
will follow the lead of previous administrations and assign a 
liaison to the jewish community stein said 
the governors point of view was received well said 
stein a special adviser to president reagan and leader of the 
conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations from 
1971 to 1973 
his explanations satisfied the group said theodore ellenoff 
president of the american jewish committee there was a measurably 
higher comfort level achieved at the meeting 
peter teeley a spokesman for sununu said in washington on 
wednesday that the meeting went well 
he added that the subject of sununus ethnic background he is 
of lebanese descent on his fathers side was raised but dismissed 
as a nonissue

a drop in demand for radioactive material could 
mean that about 300 unionized employees at the fernald uranium 
processing plant will lose their jobs after their 7weekold strike 
is resolved 
in the next couple of years we could almost go to zero 
production bruce boswell president of westinghouse materials co 
of ohio said wednesday the company operates the plant for the us 
department of energy 
the amount of uranium processed at the plant dropped from 8250 
tons last year to about 1110 tons this year he said production 
should continue at the decreased level for at least several years 
boswell said 
the exact number of layoffs has not been determined but a figure 
of 300 is not unreasonable he said 
the layoffs could affect some of the 625 workers represented by 
the atomic trades labor council who went on strike oct 7 nonunion 
employees also would be affected plant officials said 
the plant 18 miles northwest of cincinnati is officially known as 
the feed materials production center and employs about 1500 people 
it processes uranium some of which is molded into ingots and bars 
that are used to fuel energy department reactors in other states 
the plant also produces uranium for nuclear weapons 
layoffs began with 50 workers last march after the department 
closed the plants chief customer the hanford nuclear reactor in 
washington state 
the plant has been shifting from production to cleanup boswell 
said environmental repairs will continue at the plant even if it 
never processes uranium again 
the plant has been criticized in recent years for having emitted 
thousands of pounds of radioactive dust into the air the ground 
and underground water the state of ohio and the plants neighbors 
have separate us district court lawsuits pending which allege that 
the plant has contaminated its environment and endangered residents 
health

disposing of accumulated radioactive waste in 
the us nuclear weapons complex and making the plants safe is a 
job that will cost up to 110 billion and is one that joe mellen 
doesnt take lightly 
mellen is technical supervisor at the defense waste processing 
facility a 13 billion project designed to make glass out of what 
he calls the hottest stuff highlevel radioactive waste stored 
on the 300squaremile savannah river plant near aiken sc 
once the plant is fully operational in 1992 it will take 12 
years to catch up and dispose of the 33 million gallons of 
radioactive waste that has built up at savannah river since its 
reactors began operation in 1954 it will take 600 people and 60 
million a year to operate 
similar glass techniques have been tried out in france britain 
japan and west germany and if they work at savannah river they 
will be used to dispose of an even greater backlog of nuclear waste 
at the hanford site near richland wash said mellen 
the energy department which runs the complex decided to try it 
first in south carolina said mellen because if there were a 
catastrophic accident at savannah river such as an earthquake 
radioactive contaminants might reach the water table and possibly 
the river itself alongside the plant 
hanford is in an arid environment so the danger is not thought 
as acute 
turning the waste into glass rather than allowing it to sit in 
metal tanks will provide a wide margin of safety said mellen 
because if someone blew up a glass canister house we would have a 
containment and cleanup problem but face little danger of 
contamination entering the air and water supply the glass is 
virtually insoluble 
mellen wearing a business suit and a white construction hat 
twisted and ducked as he led visitors through chambers that will be 
closed to humans after operations begin 
these doors are labyrinthine to keep the telephone poles out in 
a tornado he said the building contains 10000 tons of 
reinforced steel protection against earthquakes 
when most of these buildings were built no one was even 
thinking about earthquakes said mellen the waste tanks which 
require a crew of 200 were not designed to the same earthquake 
standard that we use now 
flying buttresses and other seismic insurance have been added to 
savannah rivers three operational reactors which started running 
in 1954 they have been closed down for safety concerns and the 
first is not expected to return to production until early next year 
the department expects to complete a new generation production 
reactor at the plant by the turn of the century 
the massive concrete waste processing facility 360feet long 
100 feet high and 117 feet wide contains an inner canyon where 
all the radioactive waste will be processed behind fourfoot thick 
walls 
the heart of the operation is a melter costing 19 million the 
processed waste rich in highly dangerous cesium will be mixed with 
a fine sand called borosilicate frit and heated to 2100 
degrees fahrenheit inside stainless steel canisters 10feet tall and 
twofeet in diameter 
the canisters untouched by humans will be moved through tunnels 
to a device which uses 75000 pounds of pressure and an electric 
charge of 240000 amps to weld in a steel cap that is slightly wider 
than the container neck 
they weld cablecar rails together like this in san 
francisco said mellen 
the plant can process 1 canisters a day and each will be moved 
separately by a vehicle weighing 255000 pounds to an adjacent 
warehouse able to store 2286 canisters temporarily 
because a permanent underground repository will not be ready 
before the year 2003 at a geologically stable site in the west 
authorities must build another warehouse each canister is expected 
to generate the heat of a 470watt light bulb and the building is 
designed in such a way that air will flow over them and cool them 
in 1990 said mellen we will begin simulating a cold run 
using a nonradioactive standin for the chemicals it is going to 
take us 19 months to prove to ourselves that we are ready to go 
radioactive 
experience has taught us that caution is the way to go he 
said 
the facility will process only about 1 percent of the radioactive 
waste the hottest stuff giving off gamma rays lower level 
radioactive waste which do not emit such lethal rays are buried in 
carefully monitored yards 
radioactive contamination is a problem at most of the 17 major 
plants in the nuclear weapons complex the worst is at hanford 
where atomic reactors secretly manufactured material for the bombs 
during world war ii 
hanford stores 37 million gallons of radioactive wastes 
according to an energy department report last july environmental 
safety and health costs at hanford will run to 6332 million 
through 1995 and up to 46 billion over 50 years almost half of the 
total for the entire nuclear weapons complex 
cleaning up contamination at savannah river plant could cost 37 
billion through 1995 and up to 88 billion more through 2010 said 
the report 
another highly publicized problem exists at the rocky flats plant 
near denver lowlevel wastes such as gloves and rags had been 
shipped from rocky flats to another federal facility at idaho falls 
idaho until idaho governor cecil andrus closed state borders to the 
shipments in october 
since then seven steellined rail cars carrying 140 drums with 
55 gallons of waste each have been parked at rocky flats 
colorado gov roy romer has threatened to close the plant until 
federal officials find a solution 
the material was earmarked for the waste isolation pilot plant 
near carlsbad n m but that has not opened because congress 
adjourned this fall before formally ceding it from the bureau of 
land management to the energy department department officials say 
they do not want to store radioactive wastes at the site until they 
actually have the deed

senate foreign relations committee chairman 
claiborne pell flew to cuba thursday for talks with president fidel 
castro on the possibility of a friendlier us relationship with the 
island 
there is an old saying that if something works leave it 
alone pell said through a spokesman before departing the 
policy toward cuba is not working so it may be time to change it 
the rhode island democrat said the united states has embargoed 
blockaded and invaded cuba but the policies have not produced the 
desired result 
in addition to meeting with castro pell plans during his 
fourday stay to confer with church leaders and other private 
citizens he also will visit areas outside havana 
us relations with cuba have been unusually hostile during the 
most of the reagan administration but the two countries have 
demonstrated an ability to work constructively on a narrow range of 
issues over the past year 
in november 1987 washington and havana revived an immigration 
agreement that cuba had suspended in may 1985 in protest over the 
start of radio marti a voice of america station aimed at cuban 
listeners 
in addition a usmediated negotiation produced a breakthrough 
this week that will lead to the phased withdrawal of cuban troops 
from angola the presence of cuban forces in angola since 1975 has 
been a sore point in cubanamerican relations 
according to pells spokesman frank sieverts the senator 
believes the time for a policy review is ripe because of the change 
in administrations in washington and troop withdrawal agreement 
pell visited cuba as senatorelect in 1960 about two months 
after the united states imposed an economic embargo against cuba and 
a month before the eisenhower administration broke relations with 
the island 
afterward no member of congress visited cuba until 1974 when 
pell and the late sen jacob javits rny traveled there in 
september of that year 
three years later the united states and cuba resumed limited 
diplomatic contact with the opening of small official missions in 
each others capital 
the reagan administration has shown no interest in addressing the 
principal problems blocking the way of a more normal relationship 
in response to cuban support for nicaraguas leftist government 
and for leftist rebels elsewhere in the hemisphere the 
administration has tightened the economic embargo against cuba and 
forbids most americans from traveling to cuba under the trading with 
the enemy act 
sieverts said it would be premature to say whether pell after 
his return next monday will introduce legislation to ease the 
embargo against cuba sen mark hatfield rore initially had 
intended to accompany pell but decided not to go 
pell who was briefed by administration officials prior to his 
departure is making the trip about two weeks before the soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev will visit the island for the first time 
since he assumed power 3 years ago 
in early january castro will celebrate the 30th anniversary of 
the triumph of his revolution

the homeless the environment and other 
nonprofit causes could raise some 70 million a year if the united 
states allowed sale of postage stamps that carry the mail a message 
and a higher price according to a report released thursday 
the postagestamp suggestion was one of five proposals in a study 
of ways nonprofit organizations could find new ways to raise money 
as government aid shrinks and private donations level off the five 
suggestions could raise as much as 6 billion the report said 
the surcharge on the postage stamps would be given to the 
selected organizations sponsoring the stamps once the cost of 
printing and distribution had been deducted the report said 
for example a 25cent stamp dedicated to the homeless might 
actually sell for 35 cents with most of the extra dime going to 
homeless causes 
the study was conducted by the institute for public policy and 
administration of the union for experimenting colleges and 
universities 
these ideas should not be considered a substitution for 
traditional sources of revenue wrote mark rosenman director of 
the institute in particular government and charitable support 
must increase for nonprofit organizations to thrive 
however rosenman said federal programs providing money for 
nonprofit organizations have had 70 billion in funding cuts from 
1980 to 1986 
the causerelated postage stamps are used in several european 
countries and canada used a similar system for two years for raise 
money for the 1976 olympics the report said west germany raised 
some 20 million in 1986 on sales of stamps supporting youth causes 
the us postal service already allows commercial advertising in 
conjunction with the sale of stamps in an effort to maximize its own 
operating revenue in those cases the advertiser pays the postal 
service a fee in return for being allowed to place its message on 
stamp booklets sold at supermarkets and other outlets 
the other proposals included setting up special taxing districts 
that could raise up to 1 billion annually changing tax laws to 
encourage businesses to donate goods money or technical help using 
bond reserves the funds set aside to insure against potential 
losses to finance community development setting up special 
districts to levy taxes for specific purposes establishing 
statewide associations to negotiate discounts for group buying 
in all the institute considered some three dozen suggestions for 
new ways nonprofit organizations can raise money some of those 
included using credit cards to make monthly payments on pledges to 
nonprofit organizations providing a checkoff on income tax forms 
allowing taxpayers to designate a set amount for a specific purpose 
having the organizations charge for their services and setting up a 
nonprofit news service to cover important events and activities 
which might not otherwise be covered by the commercial press 
services

maines authority to fine the navy up to 
25000 a day for violating state hazardous waste regulations at a 
nuclear submarine overhaul base has been upheld by a federal judge 
maine and several other states that have been trying to force the 
federal government to abide by their hazardous waste laws had 
awaited us district judge gene carters decision for a year 
maine attorney general james e tierney who filed the states 
lawsuit seeking a cleanup and fines against the portsmouth naval 
shipyard in kittery could not be reached by telephone on thursday 
but deputy attorney general philip ahrens said he hopes carters 
decision wednesday sets a pattern for rulings in similar cases in 
other parts of the country 
we believe that the federal government which has some of the 
worst hazardous waste sites should be subject to the same laws as 
everyone else is said ahrens 
it was not immediately known whether the navy would appeal 
carters decision to the 1st us circuit court of appeals in 
boston justice department attorney mary elizabeth ward who handled 
the case for the navy could not be reached through the kittery 
facility where phones were answered by a taped message 
tierney filed two lawsuits in 1986 asking that the southern maine 
shipyard be required to clean up inactive solidwaste and 
hazardouswaste dumps including a landfill and mercury disposal 
areas 
the shipyard needs outside pressure tierney said at the 
time adding that the environmental protection agency did not have 
enough influence to push the pentagon around 
the navy claimed that it could not be forced to pay civil 
penalties even if it violated maine laws and that maines annual 
fees levied against all hazardous waste generators were an 
unconstitutional tax on the federal government 
in november 1987 thenus magistrate d brock hornby 
recommended that federal facilities not be exempted from state 
environmental regulations several states joined maine in asking 
carter to uphold hornbys findings 
on wednesday carter declared he wholeheartedly concurs with 
hornbys conclusion that the federal resource conservation and 
recovery act allows the recovery of civil penalties by a state 
agency against the federal government 
quoting from hornbys conclusion carter said that federal 
facilities will be treated the same as private institutions so far 
as enforcement of the solid waste and hazardous waste laws are 
concerned 
carter also ruled that the state can require the shipyard to 
contribute to a state fund used to administer the states 
hazardouswaste program 
the fees apply to other hazardous water licensees and 
generators and it is clear that the intent of the federal law is 
to have federal facilities treated in the same manner as any 
person carter said 
on the issue of civil penalties carter agreed with hornby that 
congress waived sovereign immunity a legal doctrine that shields 
the government from most lawsuits when it passed the rcra in 1976 
rcra subjects federal facilities to state hazardous waste laws

improved this year for the first time since 1983 as the overall 
share of damaged trees fell from 56 percent to 43 percent a 
government survey said thursday 
it expressed concern however that trees in alpine regions 
mostly evergreens showed only slight improvement and more than half 
remain damaged 
in keeping with trends toward improvement in neighboring west 
germany and austria the proportion of damaged trees in switzerland 
has receded to 1986 levels the annual report said 
rodolphe schlaepfer the top swiss forestry official suggested 
earlier fears about a catastrophic dying of forests were 
exaggerated 
favorable weather and a drop in pollution particularly that 
caused by ozone were major factors in the improvement over last 
year said the nationwide survey of 8000 trees 
leafy trees showed sharply improved health in most areas it said

president roh taewoo on thursday 
expressed sorrow for his friend and disgraced predecessor chun 
doohwan and appeared to come a step closer to pardoning him 
the president also hinted he would reorganize his government soon 
to break a prolonged political standoff 
enough has been done roh told a group of ruling party 
officials as a long friend i felt deep sorrow for the former 
president who had to leave in such a way 
any legal action against him is not only undesirable but also 
against the repeated promise by all opposition leaders objecting to 
political reprisals he said 
roh said it was time to close the case because the nation must 
have learned a lesson from the crisis 
government officials said roh was expected to appear on national 
tv friday night to appeal to the nation to forgive chun 
roh also indicated he would carry out an extensive government 
reorganization saying no persons who adhere to the past way of 
thinking would be needed in the new era a grand savethenation 
march has begun 
the leading national newspaper hankook ilbo said roh was 
expected to shake up his cabinet and ruling democratic justice party 
extensively next month 
in his speech friday roh also is expected to promise speedier 
democratic reforms and announce specific measures to heal political 
wounds left over from the chun era officials said 
the measures would include the reinstatement of thousands of 
illegally purged government officials and hefty financial 
compensation for the victims of a bloody 1980 civil uprising in the 
southern city of kwangju they said by official count the military 
killed some 200 people kwangju 
roh and chun both retired generals have been friends since they 
were classmates at korea military academy in the early 1950s roh 
succeeded chun when he stepped down at the end of a sevenyear term 
in february 
chun under attack for corruption and human rights abuses 
apologized to the nation wednesday and left seoul to live in 
seclusion in the countryside in a traditional korean form of 
repentance for disgraced leaders 
the expresident and his wife lee soonja spent his first day 
in rural exile at a remote 14thcentury buddhist temple in the 
mountainous eastern area 
in a nationally televised speech before going into rural exile 
chun admitted his involvement in corruption and the abuse of power 
and said he would surrender all his property worth 24 million 
roh and other government officials maintain chuns apology and 
subsequent rural exile were enough to resolve the raging 
controversy but the opposition argues the actions were far from 
enough 
many opposition and dissident groups said they would continue to 
press for chun to appear before parliamentary committees to testify 
on some of his past major political mistakes including the brutal 
military suppression of the kwangju uprising 
on thursday about 200 radical students and dissidents staged an 
outdoor protest at seouls myungdong cathedral demanding chun be 
arrested and punished on corruption charges police stayed away 
during the protest which lasted several hours 
also thursday police stopped 12 buddhist activists who were 
trying to go by car to the temple where chun is staying the buddist 
monks reportedly told police they could not tolerate the presence of 
a disgraced person such as chun at a sacred temple 
donga ilbo a leading newspaper said an informal phone survey 
of 1600 south koreans in six cities indicated at least 50 percent 
thought chuns apology was insufficient while 44 percent said the 
statement was acceptable 
of those questioned some 38 percent called for a major 
parliamentary investigation into chuns government the paper said

willie parks didnt even last until his first 
lunch hour in his new job as a typist at the hennepin county 
probation office 
he had just finished orientation and was at his desk monday when 
he was spotted by his own probation officer jack hughes who a 
couple of months earlier had drafted an arrest warrant for parks 
hugh said parks had failed to make restitution to a bank he had 
robbed and had failed to keep in touch 
astonished to discover his errant client working a mere 20 feet 
from his own desk hughes simply asked parks how he was doing his 
response was well im doing fine jack how are you hughes 
said 
he was with great calm and i was relatively amazed and we just 
went about our respective duties 
while parks sat typing a letter hughes informed david gair 
manager of the felony probations division that hed hired a felon 
then he asked a deputy sheriff to come over and arrest his client 
as the deputy was leading parks out the door in handcuffs hughes 
told him he would set a court date for a revocation of probation 
hearing and see him in court with his attorney his response to me 
was is this going to screw up my employment hughes said 
when parks applied for the 702 an hour job he didnt mention 
that he had been convicted of robbing a local bank on dec 15 1986 
one of the conditions of parks threeyear probation was that he 
repay the 300 he stole after he was released from the workhouse 
where he served four months parks had made two payments totaling 
115 but he hadnt made any payments since january or contacted his 
restitution officer hughes said 
because the office was in urgent need of typists park was hired 
before a background check could be done something that gair said 
wont happen again 
it was embarrassing gair said

hundreds of thousands of people converged 
on the sacred lake of pushkar this week as they do every november 
when the full moon heralds the coming of winter to buy and sell 
camels and celebrate the renewal of life 
the rigors of their desert life are pushed aside for a week as 
they watch the dances of gypsy women and listen to ballads sung by 
transvestite performers 
most of the day is spent feeding grooming and haggling over 
prices of onehump camels but the hindu faithful make their way to 
the lake to bathe in the waters which tradition says spouted from 
the desert when lord brahman dropped a lotus from his hand 
married women unwrap their saris to bare their breasts and dip 
them in the lake believing this will cause them to give birth to 
more sons maimed beggars make their way to the lake seeking alms 
food and spiritual salvation 
the rituals peaked with the appearance of the full moon 
wednesday the 11th day of the hindu month of kartik and the day 
hindu traditions say lord brahma dropped his lotus brahma foremost 
in the hindu trinity of gods is reverered as the creator of the 
universe 
pushkar with a population of about 9000 holds more than 400 
temples where longtailed gray monkeys with black faces swing from 
dome to dome 
about 300000 villagers most from pushkars rajasthan state and 
more than 50000 camels and cattle have gathered for the annual 
festival 
about 7000 foreign tourists mostly from north america and 
western europe joined the celebration this year according to 
rvs bhanwar general manager of the rajasthan tourist company 
a city of colorful striped tents has sprung up to house the more 
affluent visitors who pay about 50 a night for an individual tent 
and meals 
for the foreigners the biggest attractions are the chances to 
ride camels and elephants and to watch the camel races 
but livestock sales along with the religious experience are the 
chief draws for indian participants 
the drought that had ravaged the desert state of rajasthan eased 
this year when the monsoon arrived after a threeyear absence this 
meant the livestock sellers were more interested in getting good 
prices instead of getting rid of beasts they could not afford to 
feed 
a strong camel is fetching as much as 135 to 200 this year

and musa manarov on july 12 set the record for space endurance after 
orbiting since dec 21 
his english was better than mine said gunnels he asked me 
where i lived and told me i was sounding very strong it was so 
clear it was like he was hovering right over my trailer 
then they had a good chuckle over gunnels call sign kb6bun 
i told him it fit me perfectly because im in a wheelchair and 
always sitting on my buns and that was about it for the 
conversation gunnels said 
titov and manarov started hamming it up with earthbound radio 
operators nearly two weeks ago said dave sumner executive vice 
president of the connecticutbased american radio relay league an 
organization of about 155000 amateur radio enthusiasts 
the league has gotten reports of radio contact with the space

the first west coast operator to contact the space station

ham radio hobby out of desperation about seven years ago and now 
spends as much as eight hours a day on the radio 
as exciting as the chat with the cosmonaut was gunnels said it 
was only the secondmost thrilling contact he has made over the 
radio 
the most exciting was when an operator made an emergency request 
asking how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation on an accident 
victim he said 
i called the paramedics and then told the man how to do cpr 
the guy who was hurt pulled through and later even came to thank me 
in person he wanted to give me 500 but i told him to use it for 
his kids college fund said gunnels i dont do this sort of 
thing for money ham radio keeps me alive it has kept me going

attackers killed 26 civilians in two 
separate massacres slaying a sleeping family of nine and spraying 
automatic gunfire into a packed chapel the military and survivors 
said thursday 
reports reaching manila said 18 communist or moslem rebels and 13 
troops or militiamen were slain in the past three days in clashes 
around the country 
military officials blamed communist rebels for tuesdays chapel 
massacre on cebu island that left 17 dead and at least 12 wounded 
but a wealthy landowner who survived the attack said she believed 
she was the target because of a dispute with neighbors 
in the zamboanga del sur province on mindanao island the 
military said machetewielding attackers massacred a farmer his 
wife and seven children tuesday as they slept in their home 
the attackers armed with machetes and knives entered the house 
of farner patricio laranjo in the mindanao town of midsalip and 
hacked laranjo his wife and seven children to death the military 
said 
two other children survived the attack by hiding under the bodies 
of their slain kin the military said the attack was an apparent 
robbery because the killers fled with the victims savings and other 
belongings it said 
in the chapel massacre the dead included four children and two 
elderly women officials and survivors said a hospital spokesman 
said three of the wounded were in critical condition 
survivors said the gunmen some wearing fatigues arrived tuesday 
evening in bagtik about 340 miles southeast of manila 
the gunmen sprayed gunfire around the chapel and the adjacent 
residence of landowner cresencia hermosilia the chapels owner 
survivors told the associated press in telephone interviews from a 
hospital in cebu city 
the village is in an isolated mountain area at least a twohour 
hike to the nearest road and about 50 miles from the provincial 
capital on rugged roads word of the massacre reached authorities 
thursday when the survivors arrived at the hospital 
lolita gitgit 28 said villagers were praying the rosary in the 
chapel when dogs outside began to bark several men left the service 
and tried to drive away the gunmen with stones but they were all 
mowed down she said 
there were many of them said farmer jose canelio 27 the 
shooting continued for a long time maybe 20 minutes when the 
shooting ended and we got up they were gone many of us were dead 
there was much moaning 
canelio said that when the dogs barked he rushed out to 
investigate and saw two men climbing the balcony of mrs 
hermosilias twostory house he said he and other villagers tried 
to drive the intruders away with stones and the shooting suddenly 
began 
the regional military commander brig gen jesus hermosa 
visited the site thursday and told reporters that communist new 
peoples army guerrillas were behind the massacre 
the rebels attacked because the villagers had refused to pay 
revolutionary taxes hermosa said they view the villagers 
as a threat to them they had been resisting the npa 
but roldan mangubat a member of the provincial advisory board 
quoted mrs hermosilia as saying she did not believe the attackers 
were communist rebels he quoted her as saying they could be 
jealous neighbors who accused her of using religion as a front 
for making money 
villagers and relatives of mrs hermosilia said she built the 
chapel and began sponsoring regular devotions to the virgin mary 
more than 10 years ago in fulfillment of a vow after her daughter 
recovered from a serious illness 
mangubat said mrs hermosilia had received a death threat from an 
unidentified group not to proceed with a religious celebration a day 
before the attack the group claimed the celebration was too 
extravagant 
a military officer who demanded anonymity said investigators did 
not believe the attackers were rebels and were looking for an 
unidentified nephew of mrs hermosilia he did not elaborate or say 
why other military officials insisted on blaming the rebels

deadlocked lawmakers thursday averted the 
threat of thanksgiving dinner at the statehouse by adopting an 
unprecedented speaker du jour plan under which a democrat and a 
republican will preside on alternating days 
the 100member indiana house evenly divided between republicans 
and democrats for the first time in history also will give some 
powers previously held by the house speaker to the chambers 
membership breaking the speakers 132year domination of the 
chamber 
the agreement sealed by party leaders handshake at 210 am 
broke a twoday stalemate the announcement was greeted by two 
standing ovations by lawmakers who had feared the conflict would 
ruin their holiday 
in addition to alternating speakers both parties will have a 
cochairman and equal membership on each committee and there will 
be one clerk from each party to run the daytoday administration of 
the chamber 
republicans had controlled the chamber for 12 years before 
democrats picked up two seats in the nov 8 election to force the 
tie the gop still controls the senate although democrats picked up 
four seats to narrow the margin to 2624 evan bayh also was elected 
the states first democratic governor in 20 years 
it will work but it wont work easy said rep patrick j 
kiely a republican and past chairman of the ways and means 
committee everybody will have to work at it if it gets partisan 
it wont work 
the agreement could well mean a diminishing of partisan 
discussions weve had in the past and we dont need to have said 
rep jeffrey k espich also a republican 
the accord dubbed the speaker du jour or speaker of the day 
plan was reached after two days of closeddoor negotiations between 
republican leader paul s mannweiler democratic leader michael k 
phillips and their key advisers 
mannweiler and phillips are scheduled to be formally named 
cospeakers next wednesday when the house reconvenes to ratify a 
final draft of the agreement the house first met tuesday to 
organize and will return for regular business in january 
phillips said the agreement truly returned the power to the 
elected members of this body he said it restores fairness and 
equity to a legislative process dominated too long by powerful 
speakers 
these are extraordinary times and they require extraordinary 
action said mannweiler an indianapolis lawyer who served as 
house speaker the last two years 
if given the opportunity i think it will work he said 
its a whole new system for us 
the plan has several rules changes including one giving members 
the right to call down their bills for votes on the floor 
previously only the speaker decided which bills would be voted on 
and his ability to kill a bill by refusing to call it constituted 
one of the speakers most important powers 
the speaker will become more or less like a traffic cop said 
rep j jeff hays a democrat and a longtime member there will 
have to be a lot of cooperation 
we guaranteed that paul mannweiler and mike phillips cannot be 
arrogant or partisan or autocratic said rep stanley jones one 
of the democratic negotiators 
in another rule change a bill that gets a tie vote in committee 
will advance to the floor previously a bill needed a majority vote 
to advance 
safeguards will allow each party an equal chance to advance 
legislation each committee cochairman will have five socalled 
wild cards that when used will permit a bill to be heard in a 
committee even if the other partys cochairman objects on the 
budgetwriting ways and means committee each cochairman will have 
10 wild cards 
kiely previously was the sole chairman of ways and means now 
hell have to share power 
before if i didnt want to hear something i just didnt hear 
it kiely said now i lose all kinds of pressure in this 
situation because it wont be all my decision

a federal policy denying soviet nuclear 
site inspectors the chance to visit local homes for thanksgiving and 
christmas runs counter to the effort toward improving relations 
between the two nations a peace group says 
the inspectors here as part of a ussoviet nuclear treaty can 
not accept invitations to private homes under a us department of 
defense policy 
rosemary a holt president of women concerned about nuclear war 
said the rules thwart the development of better relations between 
our two countries and encourage the old mentality that we need to 
have an enemy 
the group asked the onsite inspection agency to allow soviet 
inspectors living in utah to spend thanksgiving at the home of 
university of utah law professor ed firmage 
the defense department said the soviets may visit public places 
including schools and churches but can not accept invitations to 
private homes 
the decision was for security reasons a spokesman said 
its not a good idea from a security aspect to provide 
security for the soviets if theyre going to individual homes 
said the spokesman who spoke on condition that his name not be used 
but well allow the soviets to visit public places such as 
churches schools or just about any civic organization you can think 
of he said were simply saying no to requests that the 
soviets visit individual homes theres just too many requests to 
consider and it makes guaranteeing their safety too difficult 
im underwhelmed with such reasoning said firmage how is 
it any less difficult to ensure security in a public building that 
has many offices and entrances than it is for a private home 
the defense department spokesman said the soviet inspectors would 
be served a turkey dinner by a linguist at their living quarters in 
salt lake city 
under terms of the intermediate nuclear forces treaty soviet 
inspectors may not travel outside a 31mile radius of the hercules 
aerospace plant in magna a suburb of salt lake city and they must 
be escorted at all times by american guards the same conditions 
apply to american inspectors living in the soviet union

the supreme court on thursday rejected a defense 
request to question a holocaust survivor to determine if he was 
intimidated from testifying at john demjanjuks nazi war crimes 
trial a court spokesman said 
the fivejudge panel ruled richard glazier could not be 
questioned in switzerland where he now resides as part of 
demjanjuks appeal hearing spokesman yossi hassin said the hearing 
is to begin dec 5 
demjanjuk a retired autoworker from suburban cleveland is 
appealing a conviction and death sentence for nazi war crimes handed 
down in april 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk 68 was convicted of being ivan 
the terrible a brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed 
850000 jews at the treblinka death camp in nazioccupied poland 
demjanjuk maintains he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity 
in the defense motion israeli defense attorney yoram sheftel 
contended a taped conversation between glazier and a defense 
representative in 1986 showed glazier was pressured by israeli 
authorities not to give testimony that would have cleared demjanjuk 
the prosecution contends glazier was not called to testify 
because he never saw ivan the terrible 
the judges agreed however to the defense submission of an album 
of press clippings collected by the threejudge panel that convicted 
demjanjuk the defense contends the clippings show the judges were 
biased against demjanjuk

foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
will try to negotiate the release of foreign hostages held in 
lebanon during a visit to iran that begins this weekend diplomatic 
sources said thursday 
the minister has offered his services to secure the release of 
all hostages and the iranian government has assured us that this 
corresponds with their aims an official source said privately 
nearly all the hostages are believed held by lebanese shiite 
moslem extremists loyal to iran 
iranian media also the 14 hostages who include nine americans 
were among genschers principal motives for the twoday trip which 
begins sunday the englishlanguage tehran times said he might make 
a special effort in the case of anglican church envoy terry waite 
iran has said consistently it has no control over the activities 
of shiite groups in lebanon but the government source a second west 
german official said genscher would make another plea for 
interecession 
the hostage held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was abducted march 16 
1985 waite disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving his hotel in 
moslem west beirut to negotiate for the release of anderson and 
other americans 
some foreign businessmen and diplomats in bonn feel iran may be 
willing to trade its influence with the captors for favorable 
european trade agreements to repair an economy ravaged by eight 
years of war with iraq 
west germany is among irans main trading partners the economics 
ministry says iran continues to import more goods from west germany 
than from any other country despite a decline due to the war in 
which a ceasefire began aug 20 
foreign ministry announcements have said only that genscher will 
meet with senior iranian government officials and industry leaders 
no germans are among the hostages now held in lebanon 
west german officials including genscher said they won the 
release of hostages alfred schmidt and rudolf cordes through long 
negotiations and the help of iranian and syrian officials they have 
denied media reports of ransom 
in september the hamburg newspaper bild said as much as 222 
million was paid for the release of cordes 
he and schmidt were kidnapped in january 1987 after a lebanese 
shiite mohammed ali hamadi was arrested and charged with murder 
and air piracy in the june 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner hamadi 
is being tried in frankfurt 
schmidt was released sept 7 1987 and cordes was freed two 
months ago 
asked whether genscher expected a breakthrough in waites case 
one bonn diplomat said the matter would be raised with iranian 
officials but he could not disclose details 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus carried a report thursday from the tehran times that said 
a good guess perhaps is the possibility that genschers 
discussions may turn a searchlight on the solution to the hostage 
issue in lebanon and the crisis this has generated 
is it possible then that the german minister is here as a 
mediator everything points to this being the case and this accords 
with recent moves to have terry waite the archbishop of 
canterburys representative taken hostage in lebanon released 
a number of requests have been made in recent months for the 
release of hostages in lebanon and for iran to use its ideological 
influence there on humanitarian considerations to that end the 
newspaper was quoted as saying 
some observers believe greater trade volume might generate more 
serious iranian efforts to free the hostages 
west germany sold iran 15 billion worth of goods in 1987 
including motor vehicles heavy machinery and electronic products 
and its iranian imports totaled 500 million 
about 30 prominent businessmen will accompany genscher who last 
visited iran in july 1984

the museum administration is proposing new hours of 10 am to 7 
pm its current hours are 9 am to 6 pm

these new hours would make in the lives of the employees and 
negotiate hours in which most guards would still work from 9 am to 
6 pm with some staying until 7 pm

officials in washington reportedly 
have renewed an investigation into possible improprieties in the way 
prosecutors in florida conducted a probe into illegal military aid 
to the nicaraguan contras 
former assistant us attorney jeffrey feldman said wednesday he 
testified last month at closeddoor hearings of the senate foreign 
relations committee which is looking into the way the contra 
investigation started in miami was handled 
i did this because it was my ethical responsibility to report 
any perceived ethical or legal violation that may have occurred 
while the case was under review by the justice department and the 
supervisors at the us attorneys office feldman said 
feldman the original prosecutor in the case that began in 
january 1986 refused to disclose what he told investigators 
according to a story thursday in the fort lauderdale news amp 
sunsentinel 
the newspaper said investigators are now focusing on whether the 
reagan administration deliberately stalled the investigation that 
began in miami in january 1986 to cover up oliver norths activities 
and the administrations role 
an investigation of improprieties involving former us attorney 
general edwin meese and former us attorney leon kellner was not 
pursued when substantial evidence of irregularities did not turn up 
us attorney dexter lehtinen in miami confirmed that this month 
a team of investigators from the independent counsel asked to 
interview people who were in office when the contra inquiry was 
under way 
former assistant us attorney david leiwant said wednesday that 
he was interviewed in miami last week by two fbi agents and a 
government attorney from the independent counsels office but had 
nothing new to add he was also interviewed in march 1987 
the us attorneys office investigation at question resulted in 
indictments of 13 men who range in profession from an alabama 
produce dealer to a texas oilman now living in france 
the indictments unsealed in july and august accused the men of 
aiding the contra rebels militarily even though the united states 
had not declared war on nicaragua 
a report released in november 1987 by the congressional 
committees that investigated the irancontra affair said that the 
case had been monitored by top reagan administration officials since 
it began 
that report released in november 1987 said that national 
security adviser john poindexter and aide lt col north were able 
to obtain information concerning the vulnerability of the 
enterprise the covert plan to give iran and the contras weapons 
from government officials familiar with the miami case 
john russell a spokesman for the justice department in 
washington said he had no comment on the revived investigations

a reputed drug lord whose recapture 
touched off riots in honduras has been sentenced to three years 
behind bars for a prison escape 17 years ago 
the sentencing of juan ramon matta 43 took place tuesday at the 
federal maximum security prison in marion ill where he is being 
held 
us district judge roger vinson went to the prison to conduct 
the sentencing as a costcutting measure instead of having matta 
brought to this florida panhandle city matta 43 was convicted 
here sept 13 
whenever matta leaves prison about 25 guards accompany him 
because he is considered a very highrisk inmate taxpayers saved 
about 14500 by avoiding a travel bill for the guards said us 
marshal mac mclendon of pensacola 
the prison sentencing was agreed to by mattas lawyer martin 
stolar of new york he said he hoped a delay in the sentencing 
originally scheduled for oct 27 in pensacola would reduce what he 
called hysteria surrounding his client vinson was unable to make 
the trip at that time because he was in the midst of a trial 
matta escaped from the minimumsecurity federal prison camp at 
eglin air force base about 40 miles east of pensacola in 1971 while 
serving a threeyear term for illegally entering the united states 
several people were killed and the us consulate was set afire 
in the honduran capital of tegucigalpa during rioting that followed 
his arrest there april 5 
demonstrators claimed mattas extradition to the united states by 
way of the dominican republic violated the honduran constitution he 
was taken into custody by us marshals when his plane arrived in 
new york 
matta is under indictment in three narcotics cases in california 
and one in arizona he also had been wanted for questioning in the 
1985 slaying of a us drug enforcement agent in mexico but has not 
been charged in that case 
matta had been living openly in tegucigalpa since 1986 when he 
escaped from a colombian prison where he had been held on charges 
involving the medellin drug cartel 
honduran police used helicopters to raid his home and then sent 
him out of the country accompanied by us officials 
matta is appealing the escape conviction on grounds his arrest 
was illegal his lawyer had made the same argument to vinson prior 
to trial but the judge rejected it

britains cabinet failed thursday to resolve its 
dilemma over whether to reequip the army with british or us 
battle tanks but officials said a decision likely would be made 
before christmas 
at stake is an order worth at least 2 billion for a new 
generation of 500 tanks to replace britains aging homemade 
chieftains 
the choice is between the m1 abrams made by general dynamics 
corp in michigan and challenger mark 2 built by vickers plc of 
britain 
vickers the sole british tankmaker says that if prime minister 
margaret thatchers government buys american it will kill britains 
tank manufacturing capacity and lose this country billions of 
dollars of middle east orders 
they had a good look at it a government spokesman said 
thursday after mrs thatcher and her ministers debated the issue at 
a cabinet meeting 
they identified further points that need to be looked at but 
its a complex issue we hope to have a decision within weeks 
added the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
the defense ministry has refused to comment on reports that 
british military chiefs have doubts about the challengers fire 
control system and prefer the abrams tank for its sophistication and 
offtheshelf availability 
vickers chairman sir david plastow says the company has solved 
the fire control problems and can produce a competitive tank at its 
plant in leeds central england 
he added that if vickers loses the order britain will cease to 
be an international tank manufacturer leaving the lucrative middle 
east market to the soviets and americans 
in its last major choice between british or american weapons the 
thatcher government in 1986 opted for the us boeing airborne early 
warning radar systems and scrapped a nimrod version by the british 
general electric co on grounds it did not work properly 
legislator derek fatchett who represents a leeds constituency 
said the cabinet delay thursday in the tank decision indicates a 
growing interest in the american alternative 
he said defense secretary george younger had made no 
recommendation to the cabinet adding that is an abdication of 
his responsibilities to the countrys defense industry

ballot 
the action aimed at adding stability to italian government 
completed a victory for premier ciriaco de mita who had indicated he 
would resign if the measure did not pass in the chamber of deputies 
open voting in parliament is expected to strengthen the executive 
system and create a more stable political climate in the country 
that has had 48 postwar governments 
with the secret vote governments often were confronted by 
snipers who used the secret ballot to vote against their party 
line particularly to ensure passage of pet spending products 
now parliamentarians who vote against their party directives 
will do so at their own risk 
senators voted 165132 with two abstentions thursday to abolish 
the secret vote except on measures involving personal rights family 
rights and in votes on procedures or personnel such as the election 
of a senate president the government needed 150 votes in the senate 
to abolish the vote 
the senate rejected amendments that would have also retained the 
secret vote on measures involving constitutional law or on proposals 
to amend parlimentary procedures 
under the chambers rules secret votes are still allowed on 
measures dealing with special government bodies such as the 
antimafia commission specific persons issues of conscience such 
as abortion personal liberties and substantive changes in the 
constitution 
italy was one of the few western democracies where most 
parliamentary votes were secret and citizens had no certainty about 
how their representatives voted on various issues

thousands of hemophiliacs nationwide must use 
a bloodclotting product that could contain the aids virus because 
of a severe shortage of the product normally used doctors and 
officials said 
the us food and drug administration has impounded millions of 
units of the usual concentrate called factor 8 after declaring it 
was improperly screened for contamination 
as a result many patients needing large amounts of the clotting 
substance must be given cryoprecipitate a relatively crude 
preparation made from fresh plasma that carries a higher risk of 
contamination than the impounded concentrate doctors said 
its really very ironic said dr carol kasper director of 
the hemophilia center at orthopedic hospital in los angeles one of 
the largest hemophilia clinics in the world 
our supply of concentrate is onethird of what we usually 
have kasper said wednesday we cannot do elective surgery we 
have to restrict the amount patients take home 
hemophiliacs depend on injections of concentrate because their 
bodies lack the ability to produce clotting substances putting them 
at constant risk of severe internal bleeding from everyday 
activities 
the american red cross which usually provides 20 percent of the 
nations supply of concentrate was ordered to keep its concentrate 
on the shelf because of a slight chance the product harbors the 
hepatitis or aids viruses 
an fda audit found that in a few instances the blood banks had 
not followed regulations for screening blood from which concentrate 
is made 
despite the order federal and red cross officials agree that it 
is highly unlikely that the concentrate is tainted the concentrate 
has already been treated to destroy any viruses that might have 
slipped through the screening 
my feeling is the products they are preparing are likely to be 
perfectly safe said dr joel solomon director of blood products 
for the fda 
solomon said the fda cannot bend its regulations and release the 
concentrate however because of a recent us supreme court ruling 
that held that the agency can be sued for failing to follow its own 
regulations 
as a result the fda and every other federal agency has been put 
on notice to be extra careful even when we think we have good 
cause to release something solomon said 
the supply will remain quarantined for several weeks while the 
red cross attempts to prove that the concentrate is virusfree or 
applies for a permit to use it as an experimental substance he said 
weve gone through this for weeks on end the problem is a 
legal one and weve been searching for an out solomon said

mexico has no political prisoners or secret 
jails the government declared thursday two days after human rights 
activists disrupted the senate to protest the disappearances of 369 
people 
no one is persecuted or jailed in mexico for their ideas the 
interior ministry said in a statement there are no political 
disappearances or clandestine jails or people who vanish because of 
official acts on the margin of the law 
twentyone mothers of missing people representing the human 
rights movement eureka were ejected from the senate gallery tuesday 
after shouting demands for an investigation of 369 people who 
allegedly disappeared for political reasons 
what we want is for our sons to be freed or at least for 
someone to tell us where they are and why they were detained said 
the leader of the group rosario ibarra de piedra she is a former 
presidential candidate whose son a leftist medical student 
disappeared in 1975 
the interior ministry said thursday the federal attorney 
generals office found nothing amiss when it investigated the 
situation of the people detained or disappeared since dec 1 
1982 the beginning of president miguel de la madrids 
administration he leaves office tuesday 
it said 37 of the 41 detainees cited by mrs ibarra de piedra are 
either free or held for crimes the statement said of the other 
four investigations have determined that none of these people 
took part in political activities 
no public security force took part in any act related to these 
four people and the supposed disappearances cannot be attributed to 
any decision by the mexican state to violate the rule of law which 
it has always respected the ministry declared 
the human rights organization amnesty international also has 
reported political prisoners and killings in mexico the government 
said the latest amnesty allegations issued last month deform 
reality 
amnesty cited reports of arbitrary detention and 
assassination of peasants and indians in connection with land 
disputes many assassinations were attributed to gunmen linked to 
landowners who appeared to have the tacit consent of the 
authorities it said 
according to amnesty international at least 23 political 
prisoners were held in mexico in 1987

iran and iraq began a 10day exchange of 
sick and wounded prisoners of war thursday but a jet chartered by 
the international red cross shuttled fewer men than than promised 
between the enemy capitals 
a red cross statement issued in geneva said only 19 iranians and 
41 iraqis were flown home thursday despite an accord with both sides 
providing for the repatriation of 41 iranians and 115 iraqis every 
day 
the statement said the reduced numbers resulted from 
differences of interpretation between the two parties with regard 
to criteria and procedures 
iraq which received the first prisoners accused iran of 
reneging on the agreement according to which 1570 men are to be 
repatriated in retaliation baghdad reduced the number of iranians 
sent home 
a dispatch from irans official news agency monitored in cyprus 
said fewer iraqis were returned because 15 of the 115 asked for 
political asylum 21 already had been granted asylum and 27 no 
longer were eligible for repatriation because red cross doctors 
found them recovered from their illnesses 
it said each departing prisoner was given gifts of persian 
craftwork and a copy of the koran the islamic holy book 
iran and iraq began a ceasefire aug 20 after nearly eight years 
of war and this is the first prisoner exchange since the truce it 
is being made under an agreement they signed earlier this month with 
the international committee of the red cross 
under red cross auspices 765 ill or wounded iraqis and 613 
iranians have been repatriated since 1981 the red cross says it has 
registered 50182 iraqi pows and 19284 iranians but the total held 
by both countries is estimated at about 100000 
pilot riegert poloux said the trip between the capitals which 
are only about 500 miles apart took 2 hours because he had to fly 
via turkey 
he said the governments originally agreed to let the plane use a 
direct route but final arrangements were not made in time the next 
shuttle saturday is expected to be direct 
the 730mile border was the battleground in the war which began 
in september 1980 unsponsored peace negotiations since the 
ceasefire have made little progress and the red cross fashioned the 
pow exchange agreement in separate talks with iran and iraq 
iraqi prisoners arriving at saddam international airport had 
shaved heads long beards and clean militarystyle uniforms most 
wept when they stepped from the dc9 and many shouted nationalistic 
slogans 
one who knelt to pray on the tarmac at the airport which is 
named for president saddam hussein said afterward it is great to 
be home again i feel reborn 
some shouted long live iraq long live saddam hussein others 
bent to kiss the ground while comrades prayed loudly thanking god 
for the return home 
red cross officials helped many out of the plane and turned them 
over iraqi medical personnel many were in wheelchairs some walked 
with sticks and all appeared frail 
officials would not let reporters interview the repatriated 
prisoners 
when the returning iraqis were out of the plane 19 iranian 
prisoners dressed in yellow track suits boarded it few were young 
and none used wheelchairs or crutches 
a senior iraqi officer kissed them goodbye at the plane each was 
offered a copy of the koran but some refused it 
it is not islamic i will not take it one said 
iraq accused iran of withholding some iraqi prisoners for 
political reasons 
akram witri head of the legal department at the foreign 
ministry said the red cross told the baghdad government a few hours 
before the exchange that fewer iraqis would be repatriated 
we have informed the red cross and the united nations that the 
iranians failed to accomplish their commitment and their 
international duties he told a news briefing at the airport just 
before the plane arrived 
he said iraq would continue the repatriation but will not return 
the number agreed upon unless iran does 
witri said the repatriated iraqi prisoners would be given medical 
examinations before rejoining their families

vietnam has withdrawn none of the 50000 
troops it pledged to pull out of cambodia by years end a thai 
military official said thursday 
but col phanom jinavijarana of the northeastern burapa field 
force said about 29000 vietnamese troops have retreated up to 20 
miles from the thaicambodian border 
two other regional field forces however interpreted recent 
vietnamese troop movements inside cambodia as regular troop 
rotations and reinforcements 
fresh units being sent to free others near the thaicambodia 
border would suggest vietnams new readiness to engage in escalated 
fighting with the cambodian resistance groups lt patana jiranant 
of the eastern chantaburitrat field force told a monthly news 
conference 
western analysts say more than 100000 vietnamese troops are in 
cambodia fighting a threeparty resistance coalition of the khmer 
rouge and two noncommunist groups hanoi pledged to pull out all 
its forces by 1990 
fighting is expected to intensify over the next several months 
said supreme command spokesman lt gen naruedol dejpradiyuth 
shells from fighting that began in early october have landed 
inside six thai border provinces killing and wounding an 
unspecified number of thais naruedol said he added that the dry 
season has made it easier for warring groups to transport arms and 
rapidly mobilize their troops 
naruedol said vietnamese forces continued to pursue and ambush 
the resistance forces with skirmishes in cambodias western 
provinces of battambang siem reap oddar meanchey and pursat 
the vietnamese he said also had taken positions on strategic 
hills and built roads to facilitate troop deployment 
naruedol expressed skepticism over a recent laotian claim that 
all vietnamese troops in communist laos had returned to vietnam 
he was responding to a statement tuesday by laos deputy foreign 
minister soubanh sarithirat who told thai reporters in vientiane 
that all hanois troops had left that country

more than two dozen men in sri lankan 
army uniforms raided a sugar factory shooting managers and their 
wives and killing four after robbing them officials said thursday 
an indian and a sri lankan executive died when about 25 gunmen 
attacked the factorys residence wednesday night police said 
another indian executive was wounded and the wives of both indians 
were killed they said 
the gunmen demanded money and after being given money they 
opened fire a senior police official said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
police said they did not know how much money the gunmen took 
in another development a cabinet minister said extremists killed 
445 sri lankans between oct 15 and nov 15 he blamed 324 of the 
killings on sinhalese radicals and the rest on tamil rebels 
many tamils who are mostly hindu want a separate homeland 
because they say they are discriminated against by the majority 
sinhalese who are predominantly buddhist sinhalese extremists say 
a july 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the civil war grants too 
many concessions to tamils indian troops are on the island to help 
enforce the accord 
police initially attributed the sugar mill attack in southeastern 
sri lanka to an extremist sinhalese group the peoples liberation 
front but later said they were not sure of the attackers identity 
a spokeswoman for the indian high commission or embassy said 
the attack was carried out by either sinhalese extremists or tamil 
rebels the spokeswoman commenting on condition of anonymity said 
the dead sri lankan executive was sinhalese 
the sugar mill an indiansri lankan joint business venture is 
in siyambalanduwa about 110 miles east of colombo tamil rebels 
have not been known to operate that far south although they have 
staged attacks about 20 miles north of siyambalanduwa 
the peoples liberation front has used army uniforms in the past 
and front members routinely raid army camps in search of weapons 
according to the government some members of the front are sri 
lankan army deserters 
the cabinet ministers report on ethnic killings came during a 
monthly debate in parliament on extending emergency laws that have 
routinely been renewed since the tamil separatist war started in 
1983 emergency rule was extended by a vote of 802 in the 
168member parliament which has been plagued by absenteeism and 
boycotts 
vincent perera minister of sports and parliamentary affairs 
said tamil rebels killed 115 sinhalese civilians and six sri lankan 
security men in northern and eastern sri lanka in the month ending 
nov 15 he said sinhalese radicals had committed 112 political 
murders and 212 other murders in southern and central sri 
lanka 
perera said the victims of political murders were government 
supporters and politicians he said other murders referred to 
the killings of government officials police informers and civilians 
who ignored strike calls issued by the peoples liberation front 
the front has called a series of strikes to press for the 
dissolution of parliament and the resignation of president junius r 
jayewardene 
jayewardene has said he will step down after the dec 19 
elections to choose his successor but the front claims his 
government will not conduct a fair vote 
about 8500 people mostly sinhalese civilians have been killed 
in the tamil guerrilla war and massacres since 1983 
the accord offered tamils a measure of autonomy if tamil fighters 
surrender their arms but the largest tamil militia rejected the 
accord and is battling indian forces india became involved because 
of its role as a regional power and the political clout of its own 
tamil minority

earlier this year lebanon abrogated a 1969 accord permitting the plo 
to use lebanese territory for such attacks but the guerrillas

local residents say theyre not counting on much 
improvement around ps 64 the school where some of the local 
districts suspended board members were said to have cocaine parties 
nothing seemed to change after a principal at a nearby elementary 
school in the same south bronx district was arrested recently on 
drug charges 
you got kids on drugs you got teachers on drugs and you got an 
administration on drugs said patricia martin the mother of two 
students at ps 64 how can anyone be shocked 
new york city schools chancellor dr richard green suspended the 
entire eight members of the district 9 board wednesday saying he had 
to take the unusual step of suspending the current school board 
without having any knowledge about the longterm effects of a 
grand jury probe into the allegations 
the fence behind the south bronx elementary school has gaping 
holes shattered glass and assorted trash ring the playground and 
the local crack dealers will be back on monday to greet the kids 
after the thanksgiving weekend 
every day right there said 11yearold carlos ortiz a 
fourthgrader there gesturing toward a street corner near the 
school i saw them this morning a lady and a man 
while the drug dealers worked the outside bronx district 
attorney paul gentile is investigating what went on inside the 
school where members of community school board no 9 allegedly held 
weekly friday night cocaine and booze parties 
a grand jury is also probing alleged bribery extortion and theft 
involving school boards throughout the bronx gentile said board 9 
is the focal point of that probe 
the board was unquestionably in trouble officials said whether 
the charges are true or not part of the blame falls on the citys 
school decentralization policy which makes each of 32 district 
boards autonomous with very few monitoring measures 
school board no 9 failed to meet even those requirements 
officials said 
it had failed to file mandatory annual reports with the board of 
education since the 19845 school year said board spokesman frank 
sobrino minutes of the school boards scheduled monthly meetings 
were requested by the board of education but they havent been 
filing regularly said sobrino 
reading scores in the 9th with its 26000 students and 34 
schools in the predominately black and hispanic area were the 
fifth worst of the citys 32 school districts state sen israel 
ruiz said the charges of illegal activity by the board have been 
common knowledge for years 
while he couldnt provide an exact number sobrino said there 
have been numerous complaints about board no 9 gentile said 
the allegations against the board have mushroomed in the past two 
weeks since the arrest of one of its principals matthew barnwell of 
ps 53 
conditions at barnwells school are about the same as those at 
ps 64 the school sits across from a vacant lot filled with 
abandoned furniture empty liquor bottles trash bags and broken 
glass the area is so bad residents of a neighboring nursing home 
are kept inside virtually roundtheclock 
gentile warned the investigation would be a lengthy process 
unlikely to produce any quick indictments or action

a westernoriented economist was elected 
premier thursday and miklos nemeth immediately declared he wants to 
reform the economy with help from the best qualified people not the 
best connected 
parliament approved nemeth 40 to replace communist party leader 
karoly grosz as head of government in a show of hands with 27 
deputies voting against and 36 abstaining there are 383 deputies 
acknowledging polite applause nemeth told parliament he would 
continue grosz program of economic reform and austerity coupled 
with political change 
to ensure efficiency and make room for a growing trend toward 
more pluralism nemeth said the government need not be composed 
solely of communist party members 
work must be based not on prestige but on high professionalism 
and moral impeccability he said virtues should be the basis 
for selection to top posts amid a democratic framework 
hungary already has a noncommunist president bruno f straub 
and several other officials like nemeth have risen to senior posts 
without decades of work in the party apparatus 
his rival for the premiership fellow politburo member reszo 
nyers was elected minister of state for economic affairs 
at 65 nyers is one of the most experienced men in the 
leadership the father of hungarys stalled economic reforms of the 
1960s he was removed from the politburo when reform was slowed in 
1974 but made it back to the ruling party body in may 
nyers told a news conference his goals did not differ from 
nemeths 
reforms must be pushed through if we want to maintain our 
credibility at home and abroad he said 
as the communist partys central committee secretary for 
economics since june 1987 nemeth helped prepare the reforms under 
grosz who became premier almost 18 months ago and took over as 
communist party leader in may 
grosz introduced eastern europes first personal income and value 
added taxes as well as laws to increase the flow of hard currency 
into hungary by loosening restrictions on foreign ownership and 
joint ventures 
the unpopular measures aim to reduce the 17 billion foreign debt 
and turn a stagnating economy into what grosz calls a socialist 
market economy 
nemeth has not had a high profile in the increasing debate over 
political reform in hungary and the possibility of a multiparty 
system under the new constitution due in 1990 
he said thursday he favored social pluralism from the grass 
roots 
a former student and then professor at budapests prestigious 
karl marx university of economics nemeth also spent a year at 
harvard university on a visitors program 
hungary must act as a bridge between east and west he said 
both nyers and nemeth won the unanimous approval of the communist 
partys ruling central committee on wednesday 
but things did not go so smoothly in parliament where 
traditionally docile proceedings have given way recently to debates 
that reflect growing divisions in the countryside 
the vote was delayed an hour by zoltan kiraly an outspoken 
deputy who said parliament should spend more time debating who 
should replace grosz 
grosz said kiraly had a legitimate question and defended the 
nominations saying he initiated nyers appointment so the veteran

the government proposed laws thursday to stiffen 
prison sentences for terrorism make it harder for the ira to 
finance operations and require candidates in northern ireland 
elections to disavow violence 
the measures were presented to parliament the day after a man and 
his granddaughter were killed in a bungled irish republican army 
bombing they are virtually certain to pass in the 650member house 
of commons where prime minister margaret thatcher has a huge 
101seat majority 
her government suggested the antiviolence oath last year as a 
means of undermining the iras legal political wing sinn fein in 
its attempt to win political legitimacy in northern ireland 
at the heart of sinn fein ideology is support for what it calls 
the ira armed struggle and the government calls terrorism 
sinn fein commands about onethird of the roman catholic vote in 
the troubled province and won about 10 percent of the seats on 17 of 
the provinces 26 local authorities in may 1985 elections 
theres nothing that were trying to do here to stop people 
standing at elections or to actually preclude a particular political 
party northern ireland minister richard needham told a news 
conference 
even if they sinn fein start by signing this declaration and 
abide by the rules of the declaration it at least stops the open 
insulting almost obscene advocacy of violence 
the law would permit prosecution and even removal of councilors 
who publicly support the iras violent campaign to drive the british 
from protestantdominated northern ireland and unite it with the 
irish republic which is overwhelmingly catholic 
sinn fein has said it will find a way around the declaration 
against terrorism which would apply to local government and 
provincial assembly contests it probably will take effect before 
next mays municipal elections 
an elected official who took the oath and then voiced support for 
the outlawed ira could be disqualified from office for five years 
after successful prosecution 
although it applies to all candidates the oath is designed 
primarily as a weapon for protestant council members who object to 
serving with ira supporters 
under the proposed law a court could disqualify a council member 
if his words or actions could reasonably be understood as 
expressing support for or approval of terrorism or the activities 
of a banned organization 
the law on prison sentences would require a prisoner to serve 
twothirds of his time instead of being eligible for parole at 
midpoint in his term as under current law the northern ireland 
office says onefifth of security offenders released in 1984 
committed a new terrorist offense within two years 
provisions of the third measure limit banking secrecy and empower 
courts to seize funds believed to be earned from racketeering 
related to terrorism 
northern ireland has been plagued by political and sectarian 
violence since august 1969 and more than 2700 people have been 
killed the ira is outlawed in both britain and ireland 
last month britain banned broadcast interviews with members of 
the ira and 10 other militant northern ireland groups catholic and 
protestant the government also plans to end the right of suspects 
to remain silent under police interrogation 
on wednesday night an ira bomb meant to blow up a police station 
killed a 67yearold catholic man and his granddaughter 13 and 
wounded eight other civilians 
in a statement claiming responsibility the ira called the deaths 
of barney lavery and emma donnelly tragic it added the ira 
has nothing to gain by the deaths of civilians and in fact has much 
to lose in terms of support 
police said lavery had taken emma out for an evening of bingo and 
stopped his car to pick up an elderly pedestrian when the bomb 
exploded outside the parttime police station in benburb 35 miles 
west of belfast 
they said the station was unmanned and no security personnel were 
hurt

five vietnam combat veterans are heading for 
the soviet union to reassure some brother war veterans that their 
fears anger sadness and depression are normal human reactions to 
war 
if just one person had assured me i was ok that it was a 
normal reaction it would have made an incredible difference in my 
life todd brandoff said recalling the five years he figures 
vietnam took from his life 
the soviet soldiers are not veterans of vietnam but of 
afghanistan the soviet military men called afhghantsi their 
destination is almaata a city of about 1 million almost on the 
chinese border and only about 500 miles northeast of afghanistan 
what were attempting to do is in a period of two weeks try 
to share with the soviet veterans from afghanistan what its taken 
us 20 to 25 years to learn about delayed stress and posttraumatic 
stress brandoff said 
the five men all from missoula will be in a group of 30 who 
will fly into moscow on monday to begin two weeks as guests of the 
soviet government and the men they hope to help they are paying 
1600 to 1800 apiece to get to moscow but the soviet government 
will pay for their travel in the ussr some 4000 miles and 
they will stay in private homes 
i think the soviet people are anxious for this to take place 
said another of the five steve lohning addictions therapist with 
the recovery foundation 
news reports about the soviet unions difficulties in afghanistan 
set the missoula veterans musing about being able to talk to the 
afghantsi lohning recalled then they learned that such a trip was 
being organized by diana glasgow of earthstewards network based in 
bainbridge wash she has guided 20 such trips to the soviet union 
in the last three years brandoff said 
well be talking about delayed stress and effects of the war 
on an apolitical basis he said we are men who were called 
up by our countries to fight an unpopular war that makes us their 
brothers big brothers because we have 20 years on em 
the soviets have not been spat on and despised but in many 
cases their parents still think they were in afghanistan planting 
trees 
the soviets have no equivalent of our veterans administration 
brandoff said 
they dont have anything officially as far as i know an 
agency of the government where they can go and say im stressed 
out having problems with my wife drinking too much taking drugs 
brandoff copilot of an assault helicopter was wounded in an 
ambush that shot down 12 of 14 helicopters in the flight all in 
about one minute his helicopter managed to land but it had 17 
holes in it and brandoff had seven plus shrapnel wounds 
brandoff a writer and salesman of industrial textiles considers 
himself fortunate to have survived as well as he did despite seven 
operations and years of depression and posttraumatic stress 
symptoms 
the trip to the soviet union is full of ironies brandoff says he 
and some other veterans are sure they were wounded with sovietmade 
weapons he is certain that some of the afghantsi were wounded by 
americanmade weapons 
lohning paused when asked why he was willing to pay so much money 
for this trip he spoke of his occupation of helping people deal 
with pain and confusion and of directions in his own life 
ive got some skills he said finally and i think its 
time for people to start sharing what weve got instead of killing 
people 
im willing to pay the money to do that

president pw bothas decision 
to spare the lives of the sharpeville six earned him rare praise 
from around the world but his critics at home want further proof of 
his good will 
several leading human rights activists thursday demanded the 
abolition of capital punishment other government opponents 
suggested botha acted out of expediency and called for him to free 
political prisoners like nelson mandela and dismantle apartheid 
south africas legalized race separation 
across the political spectrum there was agreement that botha 
made a politically astute move wednesday when he commuted the death 
sentences of 13 people 
they included four white policemen convicted of killing 
nonwhites and the sharpeville six five black men and a woman 
convicted of complicity in the killing of a black official during 
1984 rent riots 
the arbitrariness of the selection of those reprieved is 
frightening said brian currin director of south africas lawyers 
for human rights organization why should others who do not 
become political play balls be less fortunate 
he commented after five convicted murderers were hanged at dawn 
thursday just before two other condemned men were granted stays of 
execution so clemency petitions could be considered 
so far this year 115 people including three whites have been 
executed while botha has reprieved 49 death row prisoners the 
prison service said more than 200 people still await execution 
the rev stanley mogoba president of south africas methodist 
church said the clemency was one of the best christmas presents i 
can think of 
mr botha has illustrated in this statesmanlike act of 
reprieve that he too understands the christian message of peace and 
good will mogoba said 
i call on him to extend this understanding to others in 
different ways such as releasing political prisoners like mandela 
and dismantling the heretical structures that prop up 
apartheid he added 
the government showed further flexibility in mandelas case 
thursday when justice minister kobie coetsee said the 70yearold 
black leader wont be put back in prison after he recovers from 
tuberculosis 
mandela will be moved to a suitable comfortable and secure 
location from a private clinic where he is hospitalized coetsee 
said in a statement 
mandela head of the outlawed african national congress was 
sentenced to life in prison for plotting sabotage against the white 
minority government he has refused to renounce violence in exchange 
for his freedom 
prakash diar lawyer for the sharpeville six was bitter that 
botha gave his clients long prison terms 1825 years instead of 
freeing them 
two of his clients believe that they would be better off if 
they hanged rather than spending such long times in prison diar 
said 
cape towns argus newspaper questioned whether premeditated 
coldblooded murder by policemen should be equated with a crime 
committed in the heat of a public upheaval 
one of the most negative reactions came from an official of the 
southwest african peoples organization the leftist guerilla 
movement fighting to end south african rule over southwest africa 
also known as namibia 
nayuala kapuka swapos chief representative in zimbabwe called 
the reprieves a hoodwinking ploy to fool the international 
community 
they came barely 24 hours after another south african action was 
welcomed internationally the acceptance of a namibian peace plan 
the times of london linked the developments in an editorial 
thursday that said they suggest a new mood of flexibility in a 
government whose chief characteristic has too often been 
selfdefeating intransigence

jailed black leader nelson mandela 
wont be returning to his prison upon his recovery from tuberculosis 
but will be moved to a suitable comfortable and secure 
location the justice minister said thursday 
the 70yearold mandela head of the outlawed african national 
congress and the countrys bestknown black leader has been 
recovering from tuberculosis since august in a private clinic in a 
suburb of cape town 
the statement by justice minister kobie coetsee did not give any 
details on when mandela would leave the hospital where he would be 
taken or what restrictions he would face 
it strongly suggested however that the government was trying to 
gradually release mandela whose freedom has been the object of a 
worldwide campaign 
mandelas health has improved to such an extent that should the 
improvement continue it will eventually no longer be necessary to 
care for him in a clinic coetsee said 
when the time arrives he will be transferred to suitable 
comfortable and secure living accommodation where he will be able 
to receive members of his family more freely and on a continual 
basis coetsee added 
mandelas wife winnie said in a statement issued by family 
attorney ismail ayob that she attaches no significance to the 
statement 
mr mandela still remains a prisoner of the south african 
government and there is no indication of any imminent release the 
statement said 
earlier thursday president pw botha reportedly made a 
statement similar to coetsee us evangelist pat robertson said 
botha told him mandela would not return to prison from the clinic 
but might be kept under guard for his own protection 
robertson a tv preacher and former republican presidential 
candidate told reporters he and botha had spoken about mandela 
during a meeting at government headquarters in pretoria 
part of the discussion was taped for broadcast in the united 
states on friday but robertson did not say if the mandela 
discussion would be included 
standing on the steps outside bothas office robertson said the 
president had just told him mandela will not be returned to 
prison but i did not get any indication he would be released 
i believe president botha was quite concerned as he expressed 
it to me that theres a real possibility that mr mandela might be 
assassinated by people either to the left wing or the right wing of 
the country and he doesnt want that to happen robertson said 
he botha said he did not feel that mandela would be 
returned to prison but would be placed in some other type of he 
didnt use the term protective custody those are my words but 
some other environment after he finishes his stay in the clinic 
mandela has been jailed since 1962 he is serving a life sentence 
for conspiring with other leaders of the african national congress 
to wage an antigovernment sabotage campaign 
in early august mandela was transferred from the pollsmoor 
prison to the staterun tygerberg hospital for treatment of 
tuberculosis since aug 31 he had been recuperating in the clinic 
in 1985 mandela rejected a government offer to set him free if 
he renounced violence recently botha has hinted that mandela could 
be released without meeting this condition but the government has 
made no definitive statement on the matter 
the reports thursday appeared to support a statement made in 
washington by south african ambassador piet koornhof that mandela 
is no longer in prison koornhof reportedly said mandela was in 
the process of being returned to society and felt he would be 
released sooner rather than later 
robertson is in south africa meeting political leaders and 
producing shows for his christian broadcasting network he said he 
hoped to meet sunday with mandelas wife winnie before a religious 
rally in the black township of soweto 
robertson said anglican archbishop desmond tutu had refused to 
meet with him tutu is a former nobel peace prizewinner and a 
leading opponent of apartheid the system under which south africas 
26 million black majority ahs no say in national affairs

despite heavy subsidies food in 
czechoslovakia costs 2 times more than in west germany in relative 
terms the state news agency ctk reported thursday 
food costs especially in the lowerincome group of the 
population represent a decisive component of the family budget 
said ctk quoting a recent survey conducted by several czechoslovak 
research institutes 
it turns out that especially in young families with several 
children the needs of nutrition are not fully met especially as 
far as nutrients are concerned the report said it added that the 
problem also affects almost one third of all pensioners 
in czechoslovakia retail food prices are 2 times higher than in 
west germany 18 times higher than in east germany and 11 times 
above those in austria according to the survey ctk said it was 
based on the number of working hours needed to purchase 22 pounds 
of given products such as meat fruit or vegetables 
foodstuffs in czechoslovakia are subsidized heavily by the 
government 
in 1986 the state food production including tobacco products 
yielded a 4 billion profit while subsidies totaled 22 billion 
ctk said 
it is true that some foodstuffs are subsidized and this 
concerns mainly milk and milk products but on the whole the 
state does not lose money in food production the agency said 
in anticipation of the restructuring of wholesale prices in the 
economy on jan 1 1989 and after a partial ban on food exports and 
overthecounter sale curbs popular fears of retail food price 
increases have led to panic buying in some shops 
vaclav grametbauer of the czechoslovak finance ministry was 
quoted by the communist party daily rude pravo thursday as saying 
state subsidies will keep food prices at current levels in 1989 
subsidies are likely to equal the states entire income from the 
turnover tax on foodstuffs including higher profits from alcoholic 
drinks cigarettes and coffee

a monument depicting austrias shame and 
suffering in world war ii was unveiled thursday and served as a 
somber reminder of hitlers persecution of the jews 
more than 1000 people gathered in and around albertina square 
behind the opera house for the inauguration of the monument by 
sculptor alfred hrdlicka 
the most controversial figure in one of several scenes depicted 
is that of a jew scrubbing the pavement 
it recalls how the nazis made vienna jews scrub streets clean of 
antinazi slogans with toothbrushes after hitler annexed his native 
austria to germany in 1938 crowds of cheering austrians often 
looked on 
chief rabbi paul chaim eisenberg said the bronze figure would 
remind austrians of their past which often is an uncomfortable 
topic to the many who see themselves only as hitlers victims 
if you stand still shaken before this monument then that can 
be atonement for those who walked unmoved past the living jews 
washing the streets then eisenberg said 
thursdays ceremony was the last of many events this year 
recalling the annexation and the attacks on jews by nazi thugs in 
november 1938 that began the holocaust 
the anniversary has produced mixed emotions reflecting austrias 
dual role as victim and accomplice of the nazis 
controversy about president kurt waldheims world war ii service 
as a german army officer has been an important element in the 
observance and he played little part in the memorial events 
waldheim has been accused of committing war crimes while he was 
an intelligence officer in the balkans and denies the allegations 
an international panel of historians determined that waldheim was 
in areas where atrocities were committed knew of them and did 
nothing to stop them the historians said they found no direct 
evidence that he committed crimes but left the question of guilt 
open 
erika weinzierl head of austrias action against antisemitism 
campaign said thursday the monument challenges us to remember the 
darkest epoch of our history 
as she spoke a few dozen people in the crowd chanted inaudible 
slogans and knelt on the pavement scrubbing it like the jews of 50 
years ago 
they tossed leaflets into the crowd saying the fuehrer has 
gone but antisemitism and persecution of other minorities 
remains some of the dozens of policemen guarding thursdays 
ceremony were seen detaining at least two people 
the monument which will not be complete until next year has a 
gate of violence opening on the figure of the crouching jew 
farther on orpheus arises from the underworld as a symbol of art 
overcoming the forces of darkness 
hundreds of austrians lost their lives in a 1945 bombing raid on 
a house that stood on the site of albertina square and their remains 
are buried under the parklike triangular area 
it also has a pillar bearing pats of the declaration of 
independence made by nonnazi politicians april 27 1945 just 
before the war ended 
hrdlickas monument cost about 900000 and has been a subject of 
argument since it was commissioned in 1983 many conservative 
politicians boycotted the ceremony which was attended by chancellor 
franz vranitzky mayor helmut zilk and leaders of the small jewish 
community

two members of the british rock group pink floyd 
arrived in moscow thursday en route to watch a spaceship blast off 
with their latest album aboard 
tass the official soviet news agency said pink floyds dave 
gilmour and nick mason would accompany president francois mitterrand 
of france to observe the saturday launch from the cosmodrome at 
baikonur in soviet central asia 
the flight will be manned by a joint frenchsoviet crew 
mitterrand is expected in moscow friday 
tass said gilmour intends to find out whether he can make a 
flight aboard a soviet space craft but that for now only his music 
will go 
it said a cassette of the groups latest recording was given to 
the soyuz7 crew and will be left aboard the orbiting space station 
mir for the enjoyment of the soviet cosmonauts who have been living 
in space 
pink floyds move into space came after the cosmonauts told a 
news conference they enjoyed relaxing to the bands music 
the groups promoters immediately sent a copy of pink floyds 
latest album to moscow it was weighed disinfected and put in 
quarantine for inclusion on the flight 
pink floyds album the dark side of the moon is one of the 
biggest selling records ever made the album bound for space the 
delicate sound of thunder is a recording of a pink floyd concert 
alexander dunaev head of the soviet commercial space agency 
glavkosmos had said the visit to the launch site was turned down 
he said the group was already getting enough publicity from sending 
its album into space 
but emi records which handles pink floyd said there was an 
invitation to the launch and other preliminary events and gilmour 
left heathrow airport saying i was offered this 
onceinalifetime opportunity to be present at a launch and i 
thought i would be crazy to turn it down 
he added i am hoping to record the launch so it may turn up on

the prospect of ultraorthodox religious parties 
joining the government sparked debate among former generals thursday 
over charges that some possible cabinet ministers would encourage 
draft dodging 
the issue arose from deferments from military service given 
students in yeshivas or jewish seminaries and reports that 
orthodox parties may ask to widen the deferments as a price for 
joining a coalition government 
thirtyfive top reserve officers from both left and right signed 
a petition accusing religious party leaders of being actively 
against army service 
industry minister ariel sharon himself a reserve general 
accused signers of mixing army duty and politics and called the 
petition a dangerous and serious development in an interview 
thursday on army radio 
one signer reserve gen meir zorea challenged sharon on the 
same station 
zorea said of the religious leaders 
they want to send our sons to war and keep their sons at home 
is there a difference between their blood and ours 
the deferment practice already has stirred anger in a country 
where nearly all 18yearold jewish men and women go into military 
service as a sacred duty 
the petition was sent wednesday to prime minister yitzhak shamir 
and was printed thursday in three major israeli newspapers 
shamir rejected it said his spokesman yossi ahimeir he said 
shamir understood the signers motives but would pursue efforts to 
build a government with three ultraorthodox parties 
the petition said the signers were fearful about the intention 
to form a government in which 20 percent of its components aid and 
abet evasion of army duty by yeshiva students 
we are fearful of the dimensions of evasion and the dangers of 
it being widened and deepened 
it expressed concern for the moral and educational implications 
of having many ministers and deputy ministers active in the 
government against army service and against devotion to the defense 
of the state of israel 
former military commanders in the occupied territories and 
lebanon were among the signers 
i want to make very clear to my colleagues we are embarking on 
a very dangerous path sharon said today it is one reason and 
tomorrow it could be another reason why army personnel will try to 
determine who should be a cabinet minister 
political sources speaking on condition of anonymity say the 
ultraorthodox parties may gain five cabinet ministries 
shamirs likud bloc won 40 seats in the 120member parliament in 
nov 1 elections and the labor party won 39 shamir seeks support 
from small religious parties to govern 
religious parties worked out an arrangement after israels 
founding in 1948 for seminary students to postpone army duty the 
number deferred amounts to up to 20000 men a year 
ultraorthodox leaders argue that religious study is as crucial 
to the survival of the jewish people as serving in the army 
nine legislators from rightwing and orthodox parties meanwhile 
said in a bill submitted thursday that any soldier or civilian who 
violates standing regulations on opening fire for security 
reasons should be pardoned 
army radio said the bill came in response to pressure from jewish 
settlers confronted with the nearly yearlong palestinian uprising in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip in which 317 palestinians and 
11 israelis have died 
standing orders allow troops to fire only in event of danger to 
life settlers can use firearms only as a last resort

the kremlin indicated thursday it is open to 
compromise on proposed constitutional changes that provoked 
accusations of an attempt by moscow to usurp power from the 15 
soviet republics 
tass said it was noted by the communist partys ruling 
politburo that nationwide debates on draft laws on changes to the 
constitution and on elections of peoples deputies of the ussr 
which are drawing to a close have attested to a widely shared 
public interest in these matters 
suggestions that have come in from working people make it 
possible to substantially improve the bills and reflect public 
opinion in them more fully said the report by the official news 
agency 
the supreme soviet the national parliament is to meet tuesday 
to consider constitutional amendments that would establish a council 
of peoples deputies which in turn would elect a fulltime 
legislature and a president with enhanced powers 
one republic estonia denounced changes that would centralize 
power and declared its own sovereignty in all but defense and 
foreign affairs claiming the power to reject national laws 
authorities have mounted considerable opposition to the baltic 
republics declaration but some republics and a parliamentary 
commission studying the amendments have recommended concessions 
in tbilisi capital of the southern republic of georgia several 
thousand demonstrators were reported to have gathered thursday to 
protest the amendments 
members of a grassroots lithuanian political group arrived in 
moscow with a petition to the supreme soviet demanding sovereignty 
for their republic they claimed it bore 18 million signatures 
lithuanias legislature balked at pressure from activists for a 
declaration of sovereignty similar to estonias and the 
legislature of the other baltic republic latvia also stopped short 
of declaring autonomy 
the three baltic republics were independent between the world 
wars but the soviet union annexed them in 1940 by agreement with 
nazi germany 
there have been indications the supreme soviet will declare 
estonias actions unconstitutional which could force a showdown 
with the tiny republic 
according to tass the executive body of the byelorussian 
leglislature said estonias actions contradict the constitution of 
the ussr are at odds with the fundamental principles underlying 
the soviet socialist federation and do not contribute to 
strengthening the integral soviet multinational state and furthering 
the perestroika reform drive 
it approved the basic provisions of the proposed amendments 
tass said but the dispatch gave no indication whether it expressed 
reservations about particular sections or recommended changes 
several other legislative bodies also have criticized the 
estonian declaration 
perestroika is the name mikhail s gorbachev president and 
communist party chief gives to his program of economic and social 
reform

more deaths were reported thursday in a renewed 
outbreak of ethnic rioting in azerbaijan despite the deployment of 
soviet troops and tanks to put down violence in three cities 
officials said 
hundreds of ethnic armenians were said to be fleeing the republic 
of azerbaijan for their adjacent homeland troops reportedly used 
helicopters and trucks to evacuate women and children from one 
troubled area after the worst outbreak of violence since the first 
days of ethnic disturbances in the soviet south in february 
musa mamedov chief of the information department of the 
azerbaijani foreign ministry said thursday night that reports from 
the city of kirovabad were sketchy but that several people had been 
killed in the latest outburst 
there were more outbreaks of violence mamedov said speaking 
by telephone from the azerbaijani capital of baku there are 
victims deaths 
tass in a report read on the nightly news program vremya 
blamed the deteriorating situation on irresponsible nationalistic 
elements and acknowledged there was fighting between armenians and 
azerbaijanis 
meanwhile in the neighboring republic of georgia several 
thousand demonstrators were reported to have gathered in the capital 
of tbilisi to protest proposed amendments to the soviet constitution 
that have prompted complaints the kremlin is trying to monopolize 
power and weaken the legislatures of the 15 constituent republics 
also members of a grassroots lithuanian political organization 
arrived in moscow to deliver a petition to the supreme soviet or 
parliament demanding sovereignty for their republic they claimed 
the petition bore the signatures of 18 million citizens of the 
onceindependent baltic republic 
in kirovabad on tuesday mobs killed three soldiers and 126 
people were injured according to azerbaijani and soviet officials 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told 
reporters in moscow that tanks and troops had been sent to 
kirovabad baku and a third azerbaijani city nakhivechan to 
restore order a 10 pmto5 am curfew had been imposed he said

women and children to armenia using helicopters trucks and 
anything else they could find said boris kufaryan senior editor 
of armenias official armenpress news agency the men stayed 
behind to defend their homes 
kufaryan speaking by telephone from the armenian capital of 
yerevan said more than 1700 armenians who fled from azerbaijan in 
recent days had registered as refugees in his republic with an 
official commission created to help them 
nakhichevan is the capital of a region of the same name that 
belongs to azerbaijan but is separated from the main part of the 
republic by armenia according to the 1970 census 190000 
azerbaijanis share the region with 6000 armenians 
the two groups divided by religion language and national 
heritage have a long history of ethnic rivalry armenians are 
predominantly christian and azerbaijanis are predominantly moslem 
in kirovabad frightened armenians formed an emergency committee 
to send their women and children to armenia arpenay popoyan wife 
of armenian activist rafael popoyan said from yerevan she said 
they asked the military authorities sent to the city to provide 
transport 
the situation is sharply deteriorating in azerbaijan mrs 
popoyan said in a report echoed later by tass the official soviet 
news agency 
tensions have been running high in the caucasus since february 
when armenians began agitating for the annexation of 
nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian enclave in azerbaijan 
azerbaijani officials and kremlin leaders have rejected the demand 
azerbaijanis say hundreds of thousands of people began taking to 
the streets in baku last week to protest what they say is an 
armenian effort to send settlers to nagornokarabakh to strengthen 
the armenian majority there the numbers could not be confirmed and 
obtaining reliable reports from the affected areas was difficult 
telephone operators said phone lines to azerbaijan were constantly 
busy and few calls were getting through 
according to azerbaijani officials and media armenian settlers 
were taken last week to the shusha area of nagornokarabakh in 
official trucks and began building an aluminum processing plant and 
barracks with materials supplied by the armenian government 
the reason for these recent events is the illegal construction 
in nagornokarabakh savelli a perets head of the official 
azerbaijani news agency azerinform said in a telephone interview 
mamedov the republics foreign ministry spokesman said mobs in 
kirovabad and nakhichevan attacked local government headquarters and 
thetroops defending the buildings 
gerasimov said an army lieutenant and two privates were killed in 
the kirovabad violence 
mrs popoyan said reports from kirovabad said the soldiers were 
attacked while trying to defend armenians and that dozens of the 
rioters were injured 
a special situation was declared in nakhichevan and 
kirovabad and army troops tanks and armored personnel carriers 
sent into the streets of baku and the two other cities to quell the 
unrest azerbaijani officials said 
the cities are now under control of the army mamedov said 
earlier thursday the situation is still difficult later he 
reported violence had broken out again 
he said from 50000 to 100000 protesters were on the streets of 
baku and perets said only 70 percent to 80 percent of the labor 
force in the oilproducing industrial city on the caspian sea was at 
work 
a halfmillion armenians live in azerbaijan whose total 
population is 69 million and perets said the armenian quarters of

the labor partys governing body voted 
overwhelmingly thursday to end coalition talks with the rightwing 
likud bloc and set strict guidelines for any future negotiations 
the new rules opposed by shimon peres the party leader and 
israeli foreign minister prohibit party leaders from negotiating 
with likud without the consent of the 125member governing bureau 
talks between the centerleft party and likud on a possible joint 
government deadlocked this week prime minister yitzhak shamir leads 
the conservative bloc 
shamir and peres have been in a tenuous national unity 
coalition as equal partners since indecisive elections in july 1984 
likud won 40 of the 120 parliament seats in nov 1 elections and 
labor got 39 
likud has negotiated with small religious and rightwing parties 
for a majority coalition but the small parties made numerous 
demands and likud offered labor a junior partnership in a new 
coalition 
israel radio said likud was continuing negotiations with the 
small parties and might form a coalition by next week 
of the labor vote thursday party secretarygeneral uzi baram 
said on the radio the decision shows that there is no basis for 
negotiations with the likud 
defense minister yitzhak rabin a former labor prime minister 
said on state television in my view there is no significance to 
what was decided the talks with likud were at their invitation to 
form a joint government and the likud knows that official 
negotiations would need the partys permission 
peres said talks could continue as long as official proposals 
were brought before the party bureau if in the future there is a 
proposal it will be brought before this body he said as he left 
the meeting 
the radio said shamir and peres planned to meet by eary next week 
a foreign ministry official said privately he could not confirm 
whether a meeting would take place but added that contacts could 
continue the vote does not rule out contacts between party 
members he said

prime minister sadek elmahdis umma party 
approved a peace agreement that the governing coalitions junior 
partner signed with southern rebels two newspapers reported 
thursday 
the alayam and alsiyassa newspapers quoted ali hassan 
tajeldin ummas secretarygeneral as saying the wednesday night 
vote among party leaders was unanimous it was the first time umma 
had reacted to the pact 
parliament still must approve the accord 
the understanding was signed last week in addis ababa ethiopia 
by john garang leader of the rebel sudan peoples liberation army 
and mohamed osman almirghani spiritual leader of the democratic 
unionist party 
it calls for a ceasefire in the 5yearold civil war in which 
rebels are fighting the moslemdominated national government for 
economic and social changes in the mainly christian and animist 
south 
under the accord controversial islamic laws in sudan would be 
suspended and a constitutional conference would be convened next 
month 
according to alsiyassa tajeldin said umma leaders had 
reservations about details of the pact which they would communicate 
to the democratic unionists the newspaper report did not elaborate 
mahdi earlier expressed satisfaction with the accord and with 
rebel statements denying responsibility for a missile attack on a 
c130 plane carrying defense minister abdulmaguid khalil 
the attack came one day after the pact was signed and was blamed 
by the government on the rebels it damaged the plane but caused no 
casualties 
the fundamentalist national islamic front also a member of the 
coalition cabinet has rejected the agreement mainly because it 
suspends moslem law

the former fbi agent who headed the 
nationwide hunt for patty hearst 14 years ago opposes the heiress 
request for a full presidential pardon of her bank robbery and 
weapons possession convictions 
hearst her family and friends have maintained that she was 
brainwashed by members of the symbionese liberation army a group of 
selfstyled revolutionaries who abducted her from a house in 
berkeley in february 1974 
months later she announced she had joined her kidnappers and 
took the name tania she was arrested 19 months later in san 
francisco following one of the largest manhunts in us history 
i dont believe she was brainwashed to the point where she was 
not responsible in some way for her actions i just dont buy it 
said retired fbi special agent charles bates who led the hunt for 
hearst and the sla 
bates who has informed the pardon office of his opposition 
added he believes everybody has a right to right their wrongs but 
in crimes of violence you shouldnt get a pardon the first time you 
asked for it 
hearst 34 whose sevenyear federal prison sentence was commuted 
by president carter in 1979 is asking to be forgiven for the crime 
according to a petition filed with us pardon attorney david 
stevenson in washington she served 23 months at the womens 
correctional facitlity in pleasanton near san francisco 
the papers for the pardon were filed on aug 4 said a spokesman 
for the office brad marman a pardon would not erase hearsts 
criminal record marman added 
the heiress to a san francisco newspaper family was convicted by 
a us district court jury in 1976 for her role in the slas robbery 
of a hibernia bank branch two years before the evidence included a 
photograph by a bank camera that captured her wielding an automatic 
weapon 
hearsts prosecutor former us attorney james browning today a 
san mateo county superior court judge said earlier this year he was 
leaning against giving his approval to a possible request by hearst 
for a full pardon 
browning declined to comment on the case this week saying it is 
inappropriate because of his position as a judge 
a spokesman for the pardon office said the application review 
process could take several years and depends completely on the 
discretion of the president 
the thrust of hearsts petition is that she has been a model 
citizen wife and mother since being released from prison on feb 1 
1979 
hearst lives in westport conn with her husband and former san 
francisco police bodyguard bernard shaw and their two young 
daughters 
hearsts attorney george martinez of san francisco said 
wednesday there was no connection between her request for a full 
pardon and the release of the movie patty hearst in late 
september the movie is based on hearsts book every secret 
thing her version of the bizarre time she spent in the sla 
martinez said she wants to put it all behind her and she 
wants to get some indication that there is now complete 
understanding by the government of the extraordinary circumstances 
under which she participated in the bank robbery 
a commutation of sentence is generally considered a partial 
pardon of a crime

opec oil ministers struck a tentative 
agreement thursday to curtail their soaring production and lift 
crude prices if adopted the pact would mean higher prices for 
gasoline and other petroleum products 
oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh of iran said he would return to 
tehran on friday to consult with his government before accepting the 
plan he said he might return to the opec meeting on sunday 
the arrangement he said would set total opec production at 185 
million barrels a day for the first six months of 1989 it would 
maintain the cartels benchmark price of 18 a barrel 
recent production increases have driven oil prices well below 
that mark 
cartel members often have ignored their quotas and analysts say 
current production has well exceeded 20 million barrels a day 
each dollar increase in the price of crude oil theoretically 
means a rise of 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices 
a minister involved in the discussions with iran asked if the 
plan could be modified replied not from our point of view he 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
venezuelan oil minister julio cesar gil said its a fluid 
situation it depends mr aghazadeh is going to tehran for 
consultations 
the tentative plan worked out by the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries was put forth to break a deadlock 
between iran and iraq over a new output accord 
issam abdul raheem alchalabi iraqs oil minister has been 
insisting that iraqs production ceiling in any new pact be the same 
as irans aghazadeh had said no 
it was unclear exactly how that dispute was resolved 
asked if was still refusing to allow iraq to have the same quota 
as iran aghazadeh replied this is exactly the issue which i have 
to consult with my government 
aghazadeh who spoke to reporters after a late evening meeting 
with other ministers said iran would retain its share of total 
cartel output at 1427 percent 
i received a new proposal he said in which my main 
concern which is to preserve my percentage share is taken into 
consideration 
a ceiling of 185 million barrels would give iran a quota of 264 
million barrels a day it currently has a ceiling of 24 million 
barrels 
iraqs quota in the current accord is 15 million barrels a day 
iran has been allowed more to serve its larger domestic oil market 
aghazadeh said the other 11 members have agreed to give part of 
their share to iraq in an effort to break the deadlock 
the plan must be approved by all 13 opec ministers 
formal negotiations among the opec ministers had broken off 
shortly after the winter meeting began here monday 
the ministers had been scheduled to return to the bargaining 
table on wednesday but postponed their formal meeting until 
thursday then put it off until friday 
opec president rilwanu lukman who is nigerias oil chief and 
oil ministers sadek boussena of algeria ginandjar kartasasmita of 
indonesia and gil of venezuela met with aghazadeh for about an hour 
thursday 
asked earlier thursday whether officials had delivered an 
ultimatum to iran ginandjar replied we dont work on that basis 
we never give an ultimatum to anybody everything should be done on 
consensus 
the apparent inability of the ministers to break the iraniraq 
deadlock had raised the possibility that they might adjourn their 
talks this week and try again in december or january 
if the ministers fail to reach a production agreement this week 
analysts have said prices could weaken further 
the january contract price for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude closed wednesday on the new york mercantile 
exchange at 1397 a barrel the markets were closed thursday in the 
united states for the thanksgiving holiday 
the current ceiling for 12 members iraq refused to join is 
about 15 million barrels a day 
the cartel has been exceeding that sum with production estimated 
at more than 21 million barrels a day 
the ministers want to include iraq in any new output accord 
some of the opec ministers arrived in vienna more than a week ago 
to try to stop the feuding between iran and iraq the bitter rivals 
agreed to a ceasefire in august in their 8yearold war

firearmsrelated injuries cost american taxpayers 
an estimated 429 million a year in hospital expenses researchers 
say 
the estimate does not include the costs of such services as 
physicians fees and ambulance charges which if included could 
bring the national price tag to more than 1 billion a year the 
researchers said 
the scientists based their conclusions on a study of 134 people 
with gun injuries who were admitted in 1984 to san francisco general 
hospital where all city ambulances are required to take gunshot 
victims 
the government paid 857 percent of hospital costs not including 
professional services while the patients paid only 14 percent of 
costs the researchers reported in fridays journal of the american 
medical association 
private insurers paid for the remainder they said 
in 1984 public sources paid 53 percent of the costs for all 
hospitalizations in the united states researchers said 
it is clear from these data that public sources bear the 
greatest burden of the cost of hospitalization for firearm 
injuries said coauthor michael martin and his associates in 
epidemiology at the university of california in san francisco 
patients most of whom were injured during hangun assaults 
stayed in the hospital an average of 62 days all but 10 survived 
hospital costs ranged from 559 to 64470 with an average of 
6915 
the authors acknowledged their national cost estimates were a 
rough approximation but said they believed they had made 
reasonable assumptions in their estimates

the original spirit of thanksgiving when the 
indians and pilgrims shed their differences and shared peace was 
revived thursday night in a new york city cathedral as descendants 
of both joined hands 
about 4000 people attended the service at the cathedral of st 
john the divine it symbolized a spiritual reconciliation between 
descendants of the indians and generations of settlers who followed 
the pilgrims 
we are trying to awaken in the american people a sense of 
responsibility as parents of the next generation a sense of 
stewardship in the earth itself said chief oren lyons of the 
onondaga tribe in upstate new york 
typically indians view thanksgiving day much differently than 
the people who took over their land 
in some parts of the country they call thanskgiving a day of 
mourning to look about and see whats happened to the earth and 
see how things have changed and what terrible circumstances we are 
in today he said 
upon entering the cathedral people were handed sprigs of sage a 
sacred plant from among 6000 sprigs sent from navajos in 
northeastern arizona once inside they were treated to the sounds 
of water drums the instruments of the ankle deep singers from the 
onondagas tribe 
representatives of 12 tribes were present their deerskins and 
native dress contrasting sharply with the tuxedos and suits of the 
pilgrims descendants 
organizers said they hoped that it and several other unrelated 
services held across the nation thursday would help focus attention 
again on the true meaning of thanksgiving a notion that has been 
blurred by the years since the indians left the harvest table in 
plymouth mass in 1621 
jim buden a trustee of the cathedral said he hoped the service 
would help to resurrect the original intent of thanksgiving to 
allow indians and the new settlers to celebrate the harvest together 
that has been lost he said the native americans are no 
longer part of the american thanksgiving when in fact they were 
the original cocelebrants

a top aide to libyan leader col moammar gadhafi 
conferred with premier ciriaco de mita thursday night at the 
beginning of a visit to italy seen as part of a libyan campaign to 
shed its image of supporting terrorism 
staff maj abdulsalam jalloud is the highestranking libyan to 
visit rome officially since the firing of a libyan missile at an 
italian island hours after the us bombing of tripoli in april 1986 
jallouds last official visit to italy was in december 1984 
his meeting with de mita lasted 1 hours the libyan official is 
also expected to see pope john paul ii whom he has met before 
italian news agencies citing unidentified official sources said 
the italian government considered thursday nights meeting 
significant because it demonstrated the renewal of the dialogue 
between the two countries after previous misunderstandings 
jalloud a friend of col gadhafi since high school has played 
leading roles in libyan politics since the 1969 coup that brought 
gadhafi to power and often has been sent abroad as the countrys top 
emissary 
both libyan and italian sources recently have indicated that 
gadhafi is eager to have better relations with the west and sees his 
countrys former colonizer as a vehicle to respectability and to 
prospects of expanded economic ties with western europe 
italy depends greatly on libyan oil and is the arab states 
largest trading partner italian companies do billions of dollars in 
construction engineering commerce and other business in libya 
italian officials indicated italy welcomes the visit as an 
opportunity to increase commercial ties 
but there was some concern in political circles over jallouds 
visit 
it represents an important moment in the attempt that tripoli 
is making to achieve a better image for a country long accused of 
having too many ties with terrorist groups said filipppo caria 
head of the social democrats in the lower house of parliament 
as far as were concerned its an important occasion to check 
out the real proposals of gadhafi he noted that only last month 
gadhafi denounced italy for its colonial rule and deportation of 
libyans during the fascist regime of benito mussolini 
caria said he was concerned that in the attempt to recover a 
dialogue with tripoli commercial interests dont prevail over 
political ones 
the united states bombed the libyan capital tripoli and the 
coastal city of benghazi on april 15 1986 after accusing libya of 
involvement in the terrorist attack on a berlin disco among the 
sites hit was gadhafis house in a military compound in tripoli 
a few hours later a libyan missile was fired at the tiny 
sicilian island of lampedusa home to a us coast guard facility 
but the rocket landed harmlessly in the mediterranean 
thenpremier bettino craxi warned libya against future attack 
saying italy would hit back since then the two countries have been 
working to improve relations

the federal government plans to require 
automakers to install rearseat shoulder belts in all new cars 
beginning with the 1990 model year 
the announcement wednesday by the transportation department came 
just hours after a private research group the institute for injury 
reduction publicly criticized the department for not requiring 
shoulder restraints in rear seats 
critics for several years have questioned the degree of safety 
provided by belts that fit only across the lap most cars have this 
kind of belt in the rear seat benjamin kelley president of the 
institute said motorists are faced with a pick your poison 
choice because in some types of accidents the lap belts provide 
added protection while in others they contribute to the severity of 
injuries

a plant toxin combined with a special protein 
is able to attack and kill cells infected with the aids virus while 
leaving healthy cells untouched a group of texas researchers report 
however they cautioned that the new laboratory development 
like other incremental advances in aids research was far from 
being ready for clinical application and at best might offer a 
potential new treatment approach rather than a cure 
dr jonathan w uhr chairman of the department of microbiology 
at the university of texas southwestern medical center in dallas 
said a study to be published friday shows a synthetic molecule 
called recombinant cd4 can used in a testtube to deliver a killer 
toxin to cells infected with aids 
uhr said the cd4 molecule naturally binds to a gycoprotein 
called gp120 that forms on the surface of cells infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids

the government proposed laws thursday to stiffen 
prison sentences for terrorism make it harder for the ira to 
finance operations and require candidates in northern ireland 
elections to disavow violence 
the measures were presented to parliament the day after a man and 
his granddaughter were killed in a bungled irish republican army 
bombing they are virtually certain to pass in the 650member house 
of commons where prime minister margaret thatcher has a huge 
101seat majority 
her government suggested the antiviolence oath last year as a 
means of undermining the iras legal political wing sinn fein in 
its attempt to win political legitimacy in northern ireland 
at the heart of sinn fein ideology is support for what it calls 
the ira armed struggle and the government calls terrorism

overseas sales by us arms manufacturers 
shrank significantly in fiscal 1987 despite a strong demand for 
weapons by middle east countries a new study concludes 
the mcdonnell douglas corp was one of the few major defense 
contractors to buck the industry slump and managed to assume the 
position of no 1 arms exporter with sales totaling 657 million 
the study adds 
the value of contracts awarded to us defense contractors for 
military equipment and services earmarked for export abroad fell in 
fiscal year 1987 for the second year in a row to 49 billion off 
22 percent from the 1986 level and a whopping 44 percent below 
1985 concludes the report 
the overall decline in foreign military sale awards led to a 
drop in the level of arms export business for 17 of the top 25 us 
arms exporting companies in 1987

iran and iraq began a 10day exchange of 
sick and wounded prisoners of war thursday but a jet chartered by 
the international red cross shuttled fewer men than than promised 
between the enemy capitals 
the plane flew 52 iraqi prisoners to baghdad and 19 iranians to 
tehran 
iraq accused iran of reneging on an agreement to exchange 115 
iraqis for 41 iranians on the first day of the operation in which 
1570 men are to be repatriated in retaliation iraq reduced the 
number of iranians sent home 
a dispatch from irans official news agency monitored in cyprus 
said fewer iraqis were returned because 15 of the 115 asked for 
political asylum 21 already had been granted asylum and 27 no 
longer were eligible for repatriation because red cross doctors 
found them recovered from their illnesses

when the opec oil ministers come to town 
a small part of vienna is nearly turned into a middle eastern souk 
where the trading is in information rather than oriental rugs or 
brass plates 
a vast array of people appear when the ministers of the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries gather for their 
meetings 
the lobby of one of viennas luxury hotels is packed with 
reporters oil industry analysts and traders company officials 
us state legislators and assorted others 
it has all the hustle bustle pushing shoving shouting and 
dealing that characterizes any market 
any remark made by a minister is seized upon rumors abound and 
are spread quickly in small groups behind hotel pillars or on the 
lobby telephones 
reporters trip over oil traders in the pursuit of the latest 
scrap of news 
the right word can send the financial markets soaring millions 
of dollars can be made or lost 
unlike summits of other influential government officials opec 
meetings are openended briefings are scarce and press releases 
nonexistent 
the focus of attention is on the comingsandgoings of the 
ministers they stay in three nearby hotels overlooking the citys 
stadtpark a large garden with a statue of composer johann strauss 
most ministers are in one hotel bitter rivals iran and iraq are 
in separate hotels 
the ministers carry out most of their business by shuttling among 
the hotels their formal talks are held at opec headquarters about a 
mile away 
at this meeting they are trying to reach agreement on a new 
production accord that would limit their output and lift sagging oil 
prices 
as the ministers surrounded by bodyguards and aides hurry out 
of and into hotel elevators they are bombarded with questions 
some are more willing to talk than others and hold mininews 
conferences that generally last until the next elevator arrives 
irans oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh a former newspaper 
editor is more tolerant 
he and iraqi oil chief issam abdul raheem alchalabi are 
feuding over how much oil each will be allowed to produce in any new 
agreement 
their remarks are highly prized 
aghazadeh on tuesday sounded an optimistic note on the outcome of 
the meeting 
his brief statement i think we can reach an agreement 
sent oil prices soaring 
aghazadeh who gives the impression of a humble man later 
remarked ruefully i get the feeling that probably some traders 
benefited a lot by the reported remarks 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
aghazadeh seems to prefer to have an aide translate his remarks 
into english when a large group gathers 
he sometimes speaks in english to add to the translation 
occasionally leading to confusion over his meaning 
one day he was asked if he were seeking both a higher opec quota 
and a higher percentage of the total output 
he said he couldnt change his percentage share but listening to 
the words on a tape recorder the translator could barely be heard 
saying probably im asking for both 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
aghazadehs rival alchalabi is less willing to talk 
in fact he slips in and out of side doors to avoid reporters so 
the movements of his security personnel some of whom wait in the 
lobby are closely watched 
one man is easy to spot he has a shock of white in the front of 
his dark hair 
when he hasnt been seen for some time its likely his boss is 
gone

saudi arabias minister hisham nazer is the object of intense 
scrutiny 
observers like to say that each opec country has a single vote 
but saudi arabia has the barrels a reference to its enormous oil 
capacity and influence in the organization 
nazer says little and sometimes seems exasperated by the 
attention 
one day he returned to the hotel after a lunch with other 
ministers briefly went upstairs and then returned to the lobby 
noticing a few reporters starting to move toward him he remarked 
he hadnt been gone long enough to do anything

prince abdul aziz bin salman of saudi arabia a man with a keen 
public relations sense invited a group of reporters for coffee in

the young prince a member of the royal family acted the 
gracious host making sure his guests were enjoying themselves 
analysts who have watched the prince at recent opec meetings 
say he is obviously being groomed to be a mover and shaker in the 
oil world 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
one of the few predictable things at the meeting is the departure 
and arrival of qatars minister abdul aziz bin khalifa al thani 
from the formal cartel talks 
the minister has an uncanny knack for arriving after everyone and 
leaving before anyone else 
longtime opec watchers have given him the nickname of lifo

creditcard customers of sterns department 
store in jersey city nj received a little something extra with 
their november bills an invitation to work 
officials of mervyns a hayward califbased retail chain this 
fall made the rounds of rotary clubs with the same invitation 
with the approach of the christmas selling season that begins 
friday stores nationwide have sought to finesse their way around a 
growing demand for retail sales help 
it seems sometimes there are more helpwanted signs than job 
seekers said samuel ehrenhalt middle atlantic regional head for 
the federal bureau of labor statistics 
thats not good news for stores contemplating the christmas 
season which accounts for about quarter of their yearly sales 
some stores are offering bounties to employees who recommend 
seasonal help who stay past christmas those who do stay can get 
bonuses other stores are recruiting retirees or college and high 
school students with presentations at the beginning of the school 
year said jack fraser human resources vice president at the 
national retail merchant assocation 
some are putting stuffers in shopping bags or taking out 
display newspaper advertisements that tout store discounts a major 
drawing card 
mervyns which has 213 stores in the west and south has placed 
posters and brochures in stores seeking people who are proud of 
their accomplishments in life such as raising children managing 
a household or volunteer work 
we have been able to maintain our workforce but its a 
continuous challenge said mervyns spokeswoman kathy blackburn 
several factors have made it more difficult for retailers to fill 
their sales clerk ranks 
the pool of employees particularly younger people who make up a 
higher proportion of retail workers is declining unemployment 
hovered around 55 percent for most of 1988 down from an average 
62 percent in 1987 and 7 percent the year before according labor 
department statistics employment of 16 to 19yearolds dipped to 
79 million last month from 88 million in october 1987 
at the same time demand is increasing as demonstrated by other

pernod ricard sa cleared the final hurdle 
thursday in its takeover battle for irish distillers group plc when 
the irish government approved the french companys 442 million bid 
for the countrys biggest whiskey maker 
rival bidder grand metropolitan plc of britain said it would 
allow its higher offer of 499 million lapse because of the decision 
the ruling was announced early thursday by albert reynolds just 
before he stepped down as industry and commerce minister in a 
cabinet reshuffle 
dublinbased irish distillers said it welcomes the ministers 
decision and looks forward to a speedy resolution to the bid 
the pernod offer which came to about 698 a share vs grand 
mets 814 a share has been given the green light by the european 
community commission and courts in dublin 
on wednesday the high court in london refused a request by grand 
met for a judicial review of a british takeover panel ruling in 
favor of pernod 
in approving the takeover reynolds stipulated that irish 
distillers new owners cannot dispose of any of the targets brands 
which include jamesons and paddy whiskeys without ministerial 
approval and that nothing should be done to distort the irish 
spirits market 
pernod controls 536 percent of irish distillers shares grand 
met claims control of 3006 percent but reynolds also ruled that 
the british food and drinks giant must reduce its holding to no more 
than 30 percent of irish distillers 
grand met spokesman tim halford said the company was content 
to hold onto its minority stake in irish distillers because we 
believe that irish whiskey has a lot of potential as a world product 
if marketed properly 
we have close links with pernod around the world and a good 
working relationship with them halford said adding that well 
have to see what develops over the next few weeks and months

chinese banks caught short of cash because of 
excessive lending and falling deposits have had to issue ious to 
farmers selling grain contracted by the state officials said 
thursday 
agriculture ministry official sun xiaoping said the cash 
shortfall has occurred in several areas of the country and is 
creating problems for farmers needing money to buy materials 
he said the livelihoods of some farmers could be affected if they 
are not paid soon for their grain crops 
but chen qizhen an official from the commerce ministry said the 
use of ious was not widespread and that farmers receiving the 
promissory notes were being paid within days 
the official china daily reported earlier this month that branch 
managers of the agriculture bank of china had met in beijing to 
discuss how to come up with about 51 billion needed to pay farmers 
over the next two months 
the report said the bank would have to attract large amounts of 
deposits during the rest of the year to support its farm product 
purchases 
the cash shortage it said was caused by unchecked lending in 
the first half of the year spiralling inflation and a 21 billion 
decline in the increase of new deposits over the first 10 months of 
the year

japan is prepared to discuss rice and other 
agricultural issues in the uruguay round of world trade talks 
officials said thursday as reports surfaced that us president 
reagan has urged japan to disband its rice market barriers 
we take a positive view toward negotiations and we too 
will not avoid discussion on the issue of market access for basic 
foodstuffs said a senior ministry official briefing reporters on 
condition of anonymity 
he added however that officials preparing for the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade ministerial meeting dec 58 in 
montreal canada have not yet mapped out how japan will respond to 
possible gatt demands for foreign access to the countrys protected 
rice market 
japanese officials insist nations should be entitled to maintain 
import restrictions on basic foodstuffs they note japan must 
protect rice its stable food in order to maintain selfsufficiency 
in the grain for security reasons 
in a related development thursday foreign ministry officials 
said president reagan called on japan to open up its rice market in 
a personal letter to prime minister noboru takeshita in early 
november 
they said reagan urged japan to offer to open its rice market at 
the upcoming gatt trade negotiations which will be known as the 
uruguay round because the selection of montreal as the site was made 
at the last gatt talks two years ago in montevideo 
the officials added that reagans letter was dispatched after 
us trade representative clayton yeutter rejected a petition by the 
us rice millers association to investigate japans rice market 
barriers yeutter said however he was prepared to reconsider his 
decision if japan does not demonstrate willingness at the montreal 
meeting to open its markets 
agriculture minister takashi sato responding to yeutters 
warning in late october said while japan was prepared to disuss 
rice at the gatt meeting it would be difficult for us to 
respond if the united states singles out japan 
in his first letter to takeshita on the issue reagan said 
yeutters decision to reject the rice millers petition does not 
mean washington supports japans rice policy and warned that japans 
stance to date had been overly cautious 
yasuo goto deputy agriculture minister told reporters thursday 
that takeshita in a reponse to reagan said japan could only 
discuss rice along with other agricultural issues at the uruguay 
round according to news reports

broadcast ministers moved closer 
thursday to an agreement regulating western europes television 
programs 
ministers from the council of europe countries agreed on a 
proposal for the first continental program guidelines which would 
ban pornography racism and cigarette ads and limit advertising to 
15 percent of daily transmission time 
but a specific quota on how much programming must be 
europeanproduced a system suggested by france to stem the flood 
of american reruns was left out of the draft sent to the 22nation 
council for approval said meeting chairman bengt goransson 
at a twoday conference the ministers agreed that a high 
percentage of programming should be produced by europeans said 
goransson the swedish broadcast minster britain west germany 
holland and others opposed the quota idea 
we face today a situation in the television market where the 
european market is open for secondhand us production said 
goransson he told reporters that a set percentage could be a next 
step 
the spread of cable and satellite broadcasting has brought 
western stars cisco and pancho the monkees mr ed and other 
wellworn us series into homes all over western europe 
it isnt necessary that films always come from the states to 
europe said goransson but they should also come from europe 
to the states 
a meeting report estimated that less than 10 percent of the shows 
produced in europe ever leave the continent 
the draft convention also limits program interruptions for 
advertising says that ads cannot be directed at a single country 
and allows for suspension of programs that do not comply with some 
of the rules 
goransson said the proposal could be adopted by the council early 
next year although the leadership could still decide to make 
changes 
i think the united states will not be unhappy about the 
draft goransson said
