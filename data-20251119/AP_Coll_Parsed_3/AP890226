an authoritative chinese weekly has accused japan 
of war responsibility phobia for trying to gloss over its role 
in world war ii 
the beijing review in its edition for tuesday said attempts by 
japanese leaders to deny japans wartime crimes represent a 
chronic political disease of an epidemic nature 
the article was summarized sunday by the official xinhua news 
agency 
china has reacted strongly to recent statements by japans prime 
minister noboru takeshita that judgement on whether japan was the 
aggressor in world war ii should be left to future historians 
chinas foreign minister qian qichen in tokyo to attend the 
funeral of japans wartime head of state emperor hirohito told 
japans foreign minister sousuke uno that japan should avoid 
hurting our peoples feelings by denying and distorting history 
a member of chinas legislature accused takeshita of a gross 
deception which nobody will believe and a commentary in the 
englishlanguage china daily said takeshitas cynical utterances 
will smear the image of japan as a trustworthy member of the world 
community 
the beijing review recalled the 1982 furor over japanese history 
textbooks which china and other asian nations said were attempts to 
whitewash japans wartime aggression 
it also noted the 1986 controversy caused by education minister 
masayuki fujio and a similar dispute last year involving national 
land agency head seisuke okuno both were forced to resign their 
cabinet posts after making statements justifying japans invasions 
of korea and china 
it is to avoid a repeat of such a historical tragedy that we 
chinese pay so much attention to and criticize those irresponsible 
speeches which not only whitewash past aggressors but may also 
pave the way for militarism the weekly said 
it said japans refusal to recognize its responsibilities in the 
war could impede its drive to become a major diplomatic power 
if the statesmen of a country lack the courage to face history 
and accept its reality and cannot obtain trust from the 
international community the country can hardly play a major role in 
world politics

while president bush met sunday with the leaders 
of modern china barbara bush sipped tea watched chinese dancers 
and heard a chinese rendition of yankee doodle dandy within the 
walled compound of the last emperor 
she then strolled through the royal family garden this is 
marvelous she said 
although the us first lady lived in the chinese capital city 
when her husband served as us liaison officer in the mid1970s 
neither the compound nor the forbidden city which mrs bush also 
planned to visit was open to the public at the time 
mrs bush attended services sunday morning with her husband at 
the chongwenmen protestant church where they worshipped when they 
lived in china she then toured the mansion of the regent prince 
the elegant and traditional walled compound was the home of the 
xuangtong emperor better known as pu yi 
pu yi whose life was told in the awardwinning 1987 movie the 
last emperor was enthroned in 1909 at the age of 3 but a 
revolution three years later forced him to abdicate 
mrs bush wearing a blue wool suit and her trademark pearl 
necklace had tea and cookies with chinese and american women in the 
garden of the compound 
a chinese band clad in blue traditional robes played string 
instruments while young women performed dances with a traditional 
flavor at the close they gave a rendition of yankee doodle dandy 
and mrs bush stood up and clapped enthusiastically 
pu yis family mansion alongside a northern beijing lake is 
guarded by huge red doors and an ornate gate and remains off limits 
to ordinary sightseers 
like dozens of other aristocratic mansions of old beijing it was 
taken over by the communists who took power in 1949 now it houses 
the public health ministry 
its stately halls have been divided into tiny offices where 
hundreds of bureaucrats work under dim light bulbs 
however mrs bush had tea and watched the music and dance 
program in a separate reception area with about 30 chinese women 
among those invited was premier li pengs wife zhu lin 
in the afternoon mrs bush was to view a newly opened exhibit on 
pu yis life in the imperial palace in the heart of beijing known 
as the forbidden city 
inside two faded wooden halls in a small inner courtyard of the 
vast palace complex the exhibit contains pu yis englishmade 
bicyle gramophone childhood toys set of encyclopaedia britannica 
and wedding robe its multicolored silk threads still brilliant 67 
years later 
it also includes a small piano on which pu yi sometimes composed 
traditionalstyle tunes and a taped recording of one titled 
generals on a southern expedition that is played repeatedly for 
visitors 
on the day peace is restored my gentlemen i shall bid you 
return and divest you of your battle robes pu yi wrote in the 
lyrics 
for pu yi and the feeble forces of monarchial restoration 
however there was no victory even though he continued to live in 
the palace for 12 years after abdicating 
the exhibit is a poignant testimony to the aimlessness and futile 
hopes of those 12 years pictures show him in full court dress 
seated on a throne during a brief period when he hoped for 
restoration and later taking the throne as the puppet ruler of a 
japanesecreated kingdom of manchukuo in northeast china 
finally he is shown in padded peasant clothing exercising with 
other prisoners in a communist prison for war criminals 
mrs bushs itinerary is very different from nancy reagans who 
visited the city in 1984 
during her twoday tour mrs reagan toured the beijing zoo a 
temple where emperors once offered sacrifices for good harvests an 
acupuncture clinic and a kindergarten mrs reagan also had tea at 
the home of a teacher

chinese leader deng xiaoping got right down to business on a 
range of topics with premier li peng and returned to a church where 
he and his wife barbara had worshipped in 197475 
the president was bid a hearty welcome by deng as they two 
began a session at the great hall of the people 
during a picturetaking opportunity deng 84 thanked bush for 
visiting china shortly after you took office and said we two 
have been good friends 
im delighted to see you looking so well bush told the 
chinese leader who appeared healthy 
the session followed a meeting between bush and chinese premier 
li peng 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater called the meeting with 
li a remarkable and unprecedented dialogue covering issues 
ranging from kampuchea cambodia south korea north korea the 
middle east trade afghanistan taiwan and nuclear proliferation 
it was an engaged conversation we got right down to business 
we thought it was an extraordinary conversation fitzwater said of 
bush 
fitzwater briefing reporters sunday afternoon said that bush 
and his wife barbara were quite pleased with the pace and 
substance of the trip and with the extraordinarily warm reception 
by the chinese 
during the meeting with li bush said that i come here at an 
interesting time both an opportunity and a challenge according 
to the xinhua the official chinese news agency it quoted the 
president as saying that im delighted that soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev will visit china in may its a good thing 
bush said 
xinhua said that li told bush that china hopes to establish 
goodneighborly relations with the soviets but not the bond of 
alliance that existed in the 1950s 
in his meeting with deng the two talked about sports and cards 
deng told bush youre an athlete thats why youre in good 
shape 
bush replied i keep trying 
deng agreed that sports were important and said that the one 
sport they had in common was playing bridge 
i gave up bridge a long time ago too complicated too 
difficult bush said 
deng said he expected bushs job as president would make it even 
harder to find time to play the card game i know its a hard job 
to be the president of the united states and you will be the 
champion of the world in terms of having the busiest work 
schedule he said 
bush apologized to deng that his visit to china was very 
short just 40 hours 
earlier the bushes attended a church that bush called our home 
away from home in the heart of the chinese capital 
he told the chongwenmen protestant church congregation that a 
strong faith in god helps people cope with seemingly insurmountable 
problems 
just before going into his meetings with top chinese officials 
bush mixed secular and spiritual talk in brief remarks to roughly 
1400 worshippers seated in the sanctuary of the church hidden 
behind high stone walls 
speaking through an interpreter he said that while relations 
between the united states and china are basically sound sometimes 
our problems can seem bigger than life itself intractable and 
fearsome but i am convinced that with each other with our faith 
in god we can meet any challenge and we will 
bush met later sunday with cambodian resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk fitzwater said there were no new developments at 
that meeting and that bush had reiterated his support for a 
reconcilation government in cambodia with the prince at the head of 
it 
fitzwater also said bush assured chinese leaders that the united 
states continues to subscribe to its onechina policy and believes 
that the problem of taiwan is one that should be resolved by the 
chinese people without pressure from outside 
he also said that chinese leaders assured bush that the chinese 
would not sell missiles to other nations with the exception of 
saudia arabia with which the chinese has contractual commitments 
this relationship is as important as any we have anywhgere in 
the world fitzwater quoted bush as telling his hosts they will 
not be affected by rapid changes in other relationships the 
president said 
bush and his wife lived here in 197475 when bush was the head of 
the us liaison office in the period just before the formal 
restoration of diplomatic relations between the two world giants 
during his talk sunday bush noted that his daughter dorothy 
leblond had been baptized at the chongwenmen protestant church here 
in 1975 when she was 16 
that gives us a special feeling of identity and warmth he 
said 
to the predominantly chinese congregation seated in the octagonal 
brick building with dark wood paneling and a neon cross bush 
praised our church away from home 
its a little different though he said today we came up 
with 20 motor cars with a motorcade and i used to come to church 
on my bicycle a flying pigeon he said 
at one point he picked up a chinese baby and cuddled it and the 
baby said grandfather in chinese 
bush presented church with a gift bible saying it comes to you 
with our heartfelt thanks and our love 
this church in a sense was our home away from home he said 
on saturday bush mingled with people at a downtown landmark 
delivered a thank you in chinese and presented li with a pair of 
black leather boots from texas 
bush here for a twoday working visit and chinese president 
yang shangkun toasted each other at the banquet in the great hall of 
the people with vows to strengthen relations while both hinted at 
issues that remain sources of friction 
bush made veiled references to human rights concerns and weapons 
proliferation while yang cautioned that twists and turns and 
relapses may occur in the process of relaxation 
but yang told bush that his visit coming so soon after his 
inauguration was a big event in uschinese relations 
the chinese leaders attach great importance to your current 
visit the chinese people know you well and so do you know 
them yang said 
bush returned the praise claiming the world as a whole is 
watching the larger movement of our two great nations as we build 
even firmer bonds across the vast ocean that joins us

a preliminary investigation has raised the 
possibility that stress and not a bomb or metal fatigue ripped 
open a jumbo jet hurling nine people to their deaths federal 
officials said saturday 
navy and coast guard ships meanwhile spent the day searching 
3000 square miles of ocean for debris from the united airlines jet 
which made an emergency landing friday with a 10footwide 
40foothigh hole in its side 
the boeing 747 had been en route to auckland new zealand with 
336 passengers and 18 crew members aboard 
nothing yet gives us any indication of a bomb in the cargo 
area but we are not drawing any conclusions yet lee dickinson 
an investigator with the national transportation safety board told a 
news conference saturday night 
dickinson said fbi agents searched the united airlines boeing 
747s cargo area with dogs earlier saturday but found no evidence 
of explosives 
michael marx the ntsbs senior metallurgist said there was no 
evidence that metal fatigue caused the hole marx said the condition 
of the holes edge indicated that overstress a stress greater 
than the plane could stand had been placed on the aircraft but 
did not say what it might have been 
however neither marx nor dickinson would rule out metal fatigue 
as a possible cause 
a key question for investigators is whether the loss of a cargo 
door was a cause or a result of the plane tearing open 
if a door opened in flight it could possibly cause 
overstress dickinson said in response to a reporters question 
dickinson added that the condition could be caused by other factors 
he declined to explain 
the government last july ordered airlines to improve cargo door 
lock systems on older boeing 747s after one partly opened in flight 
united followed the directive as far as an initial inspection 
but had not added an aluminum and steel part required to be 
installed on the door by dec 31 of this year spokesman russell 
mack said in chicago united has completed the addition on six of 25 
aircraft it applies to he said 
dickinson said the pilot and copilot of united airlines flight 
811 told investigators saturday there was no indication of trouble 
closing the cargo doors dickinson said a warning light in the 
cockpit would indicate if the doors were not closed properly 
the hole follows the dimensions of the cargo door exactly and 
flares further up the aircraft dickinson said 
investigators began examining the damaged jet earlier in the day 
a dozen people involved in the investigation peered into the 
exposed cargo hold as workers removed baggage from the jumbo jet and 
a military police officer armed with an m16 rifle kept reporters 
and photographers at least 50 yards away 
aviation experts said earlier the most likely cause was metal 
fatigue however three fbi bomb experts from washington were sent 
to join the investigation 
between 70 and 100 people are participating in the investigation 
including 16 from the ntsb to look into every possible cause said 
dickinson 
the fbi is also here working with us because as ive said 
earlier all doors are open said dickinson all doors are 
completely wide open 
investigators may make some preliminary findings but it will 
take nine to 12 months to determine the cause of the incident 
dickinson said 
one of three coast guard cutters searching the ocean south of 
here saturday afternoon retrieved part of an overhead compartment 
said lt cmdr paul ellner a coast guard spokesman 
the coast guard also found safety instruction cards with united 
airlines on them seat cushions and personal items including shoes 
and a teddy bear ellner said 
six americans two australians and a new zealander aboard united 
flight 811 were instantly blown through the opening and at least 
one was sucked into one of the jets engines authorities said the 
airplane was at 20000 feet when the accident happened 
honolulu hospitals reported treating 27 people mostly for minor 
injuries 
officials said three people remained in hospitals saturday a 
48yearold flight attendant in fair condition with broken bones in 
her neck and upper back and abdominal injuries a flight attendant 
recovering from surgery on a fractured arm and a 73yearold new 
zealand man in fair condition with heart problems 
more than 200 people boarded other flights those who didnt want 
to fly were put up in hotels 
early saturday 110 passengers from flight 811 arrived in new 
zealand aboard a special united flight 
it was a nightmare and im glad i got back on that plane today 
because if id waited i dont know if i would have ever flown 
again said cathy mehan of washington who said she was sitting 
about 1012 rows behind the hole in the fuselage of flight 811 
i think that the united crew did an excellent incredible job 
the pilot should be recommended commended he was fantastic she 
said i was afraid i didnt think we were gonna make it i 
thought that this was the end 
at dawn three coast guard and navy ships and helicopters resumed 
their search of the pacific about 100 miles south of here for debris 
from the plane a vessel friday found two airline seat cushions and 
a 4by6foot piece of metal believed to be from the jet coast 
guard spokesman keith spangler said 
authorities had not decided late saturday whether the search 
would continue sunday spangler said 
the nine missing passengers were identified as susan craig and 
harry craig of morristown nj rose harley of hackensack nj 
anthony fallon and barbara fallon of long beach calif mary t 
handley of bay city mich lee campbell of wellington new zealand 
and dr john michael crawford and john swann both of sydney 
australia 
according to hawaii department of transportation spokesman 
marilyn kali the 18yearold boeing 747 the oldest in uniteds 
jumbo jet fleet took off for new zealand at 134 am 
pilot david n cronin heard a loud thump just before the no 
3 engine failed a few minutes into the flight a short time later 
the no 4 engine fire indicator activated and cronin shut it down 
at 216 am cronin radioed the traffic control tower asking 
for emergency vehicles which were standing by when the plane landed 
at 233 am 
united said cronin would have no comment 
investigators recovered small body fragments and pieces of 
clothing in the jets no 3 engine according to the honolulu 
medical examiners office 
susan starrett a medical examiner investigator said it was 
unlikely officials would be able to identify the remains even as 
male or female 
bill speicher uniteds pacific division vice president said he 
hopes to have the plane repaired and returned to service in three or 
four months 
united spokesman lawrence m nagin said the jet had undergone a 
complete fourday inspection 88 days before the accident and a less 
intensive check feb 16 
it has no history of maintenance problems this aircraft had a 
routine maintenance history nagin told reporters in chicago 
bobbie nardis a spokeswoman for the faa in oklahoma city where 
safety records are kept said cracks were once found near the 
structure that holds the engine to the wing she said the plane also 
once had an engine fire 
but ms nardis said people who work with these reports all the 
time said the plane had nothing on its record that particularly 
distinguished it from other jumbo jets

president bush and chinese leader deng xiaoping 
toasted new progress in sinoamerican relations sunday and bush 
assured deng that their ties would not be weakened by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs plans to visit beijing this spring 
bush also raised previously expressed us concerns about 
proliferation of nuclear missiles china is one of the worlds 
biggest arms merchants 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said premier li peng 
reaffirmed an earlier commitment by deng that china would not sell 
missiles to any country other than saudi arabia 
later however deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk 
said fitzwater had misspoken popadiuk said li did not discuss 
specifics but merely restated assurances given last october that 
china would act in a responsible manner regarding missile sales 
the united states has said it is satisfied with that policy 
before heading for south korea en route home to washington bush 
appeared on the governmentrun television network for a live 
15minute interview by chinese journalists an unprecedented event 
for a foreign visitor here 
he also entertained his chinese hosts at a farewell banquet 
featuring a texasstyle barbecue and lone star beer but one of 
bushs invited guests leading chinese dissident fang lizhi was 
barred at the front door of the hotel by chinese police according 
to an american witness 
bush had invited fang a respected astrophysicist as a gesture 
of support for a small group of chinese intellectuals who have 
called for greater political freedom this really shows chinas 
attitude toward human rights fang said later in a telephone 
interview at the most i would have been able to say hello to the 
president 
white house officials when asked about the incident had no 
immediate comment it was not known if bush was aware of fang and 
his wifes forcible exclusion from the banquet fitzwater had said 
earlier it was unlikely that bush would have spoken to fang at the 
dinner 
south korean authorities meanwhile braced for the threat of 
violent antiamerican demonstrations when bush flies to seoul on 
monday for a threehour visit that will include talks with 
government leaders and an address to the national assembly an 
estimated 120000 police security agents and commandos were put on 
alert 
during the tv interview bush expressed hope for expanded 
uschina trade which he said already had grown from 800 million 
in the mid1970s to 14 billion today 
we are prepared to go the extra mile in terms of investments 
in terms of business exports and imports he told a questioner 
in his toast at the farewell banquet bush said he was leaving 
beijing convinced that uschina relations are strong 
we have great responsibilities and also great possibilities 
the president added promising to work with chinas leadership to 
help make this world a safer more peaceful place for us all 
deng 84 the countrys senior leader expressed a hearty 
welcome as he greeted bush in the cavernous great hall of the 
people we two have been good friends deng told his visitor 
throughout the final day of his visit to beijing bush emphasized 
a us desire for warm relations with china 
as his rode around beijing in a black limousine bush repeatedly 
used a microphone in the car to say thank you thank you to 
thousands of chinese people who lined the streets 
however the air of cordiality was marred when chinese security 
guards pushed and shoved people away from barbara bush when the 
presidents wife toured the forbidden city ancient home of chinese 
emperors 
carol powers a white house photographer accompanying the first 
lady was pushed facefirst into a door 
mrs bush interrupted the tour to declare this girls job is 
to take my picture and she got hit she works for my husband mrs 
bush said the security guards should calm down 
later mrs bush produced ms powers at a news conference and 
reported that shes fine 
the president and deng established a warm relationship during 
bushs tenure as us envoy to beijing in the mid1970s before 
formal diplomatic relations were restored between their two 
countries on sunday they bantered about playing bridge one of the 
chinese leaders passions 
i gave up bridge a long time ago too complicated too 
difficult you are the expert bush told deng 
now its even more difficult for you to find time to play 
bridge deng responded i know its a hard job to be the 
president of the united states and you will be the champion of the 
world in terms of having the busiest work schedule 
bush conferred separately with li for two hours this 
relationship is as important as any we have anywhere in the world 
bush said 
in the past the united states has expressed concern over human 
rights in china but the white house said bush did not raise the 
subject during his twoday visit this time 
bush dressed in a western business suit and deng wearing a 
gray mao suit spent most of their hourlong meeting discussing 
eastwest relations focusing on gorbachevs scheduled trip to 
beijing in may it will be the first sinosoviet summit meeting in 
three decades 
fitzwater said the president told deng that the united states 
welcomes gorbachevs trip as an important and useful step in 
providing stability to the region and the world 
he bush wanted to assure the chairman that us policy with 
regard to china would not be affected by the outcome of those 
discussions fitzwater said 
the spokesman said deng spoke at length about the history of 
sovietchinese relations and the difficulties he faces in having 
this meeting with gorbachev as part of a normalization process 
deng almost never hosts luncheons for foreign leaders but made 
an exception for bush 
deng said he wouldnt give a speech but added let us all raise 
our glasses to the health of president and mrs bush and other 
american friends and to the new progress in chinaus relations 
deng downed a small glass of maotai a potent sorghum liquor 
bush did the same 
fitzwater said bush told deng the united states was encouraged by 
developments on the korean peninsula and hoped china would use its 
influence with north korea to engage in talks with the seoul 
government 
on the delicate issue of taiwan bush said the united states is 
committed to a onechina policy and that the future of taiwan 
home of the chinese nationalist government ousted from the mainland 
in 1949 must be worked out by taiwan and the beijing government 
china is unhappy about us arms sales to taiwan and has urged 
washington to be more aggressive in promoting contacts between 
beijing and taiwan 
bush also met on sunday with prince norodom sihanouk of cambodia 
and said that we strongly support the exiled resistance leader 
in his campaign for withdrawal of vietnamese occupation forces from 
cambodia 
both the united states and china want sihanouk to lead a 
coalition government in cambodia

in the hijacking trial of fawaz younis under 
way in federal court the government is trying to keep secrets about 
how it nabbed the lebanese militiaman in an undercover operation in 
the mediterranean 
younis is the first suspect arrested overseas and tried under the 
1984 hostagetaking act which gives the government long arm 
jurisdiction in cases involving american hostages 
younis 29 is a relative small fry said neil livingstone an 
expert on terrorism this is not the john dillinger of the 
terrorist world he is a relatively lowlevel terrorist 
livingstone said 
but to nab him federal authorities cast a multimillion dollar 
net involving undercover agents an aircraft carrier helicopters 
and a fleet of aircraft according to court arguments and documents 
in the case 
four days after his arrest on sept 13 1987 younis was flown to 
the united states in a 13hour flight aboard a plane that refueled 
several times in the air avoiding any contact with foreign 
governments that might have clouded us jurisdiction in the case 
us agents used sensitive intelligence methods in making the 
arrest and a number of the key players in the case are living under 
new identities in the federal witness protection program 
prosecutors said during a pretrial hearing on wednesday 
at the hearing us distrist chief judge aubrey robinson jr 
denied requests by defense attorney francis d carter for access to 
classified information in 12 categories ranging from the names of 
highlevel policymakers who helped plan the arrest to details about 
us air force army navy and intelligence assets used in the case 
younis is accused of leading a band of men who armed with ak47 
assault rifles shot their way past security guards and boarded a 
royal jordanian jetliner in beirut on june 11 1985 
younis was a member of lebanons amal militia a shiite moslem 
faction he was under orders to fly the plane to tunis where an 
arab league meeting was under way and read a statement demanding 
the withdrawal of palestinian guerrillas from lebanon defense 
counsel carter said wednesday 
tunisian authorities denied the plane permission to land and it 
returned to beirut 
the evidence against younis includes a videotape of him on the 
beirut tarmac armed with an assault rifle announcing that the 
boeing 727 would be blown up 
one of the passengers william l slade has also testified that 
younis emerged from the planes cockpit several times during the 
39hour hijacking and ordered other hijackers to stop beating 
jordanian skymarshals the beatings resumed when younis returned to 
the cockpit slade testified identifying the defendant in the 
courtroom no one was killed in the hijacking 
in septmeber 1987 younis was lured to the mediterranean island 
of cyprus by a friend identified by federal authorities as jamal 
hamdan 
court papers contain the transcript of a conversation 
clandestinely recorded at hamdans apartment on cyprus in which 
younis said he was picked for the hijacking by the head of amal 
nabih berri who is also lebanons justice minister 
berri has denounced the arrest as an attack against the honor 
of lebanon 
during pretrial argument the defense attorney said he would not 
contend that berri ordered the hijacking but that his client would 
testify that he was under orders to pirate a plane to tunis 
according to the defense attorneys arguments in court jamal 
hamdan and his brother ali lured younis from cyprus to a twomasted 
sailboat with the promise of a drug deal and a party 
two fbi agents a man and a woman were aboard the yacht which 
was located in international waters to avoid the need for 
extradition hearings 
in the struggle to arrest younis both his wrists suffered 
hairline fractures federal authorities said when they announced the 
arrest 
younis was transferred to a naval supply vessel the uss butte 
which took four days to carry him to the western mediterrean where 
he was moved to the carrier uss saratoga carter said at the hearing 
carter asked to introduce evidence that five doctors were flown 
by helicopter to the saratoga beforehand in the event that younis 
was hurt but that the defendant was not treated until after he 
confessed 
the only medication my client received was a bag of ice the 
defense attorney said 
the court said the judge will allow the defense to argue that 
four days is a long time to transport the defendant from the eastern 
mediterranean to the western mediterranean and that that there 
was not a normal complement aboard the ship said robinson 
the defense in debating whether the confession was free and 
voluntary will be allowed to argue that there was undue delay 
in diagnosing and treating younis the judge said

president bush met with prince norodom sihanouk of 
cambodia on sunday and expressed support for the resistance leaders 
efforts to end vietnams 10year occupation of his country 
we wish you well and respect the resistance you represent 
bush told the 66yearold sihanouk during their 20minute meeting at 
the diaoyutai state guest house where both were residing 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush made no 
new commitments to the prince 
the united states provides nonlethal aid to the sihanouk faction 
and a second noncommunist group seeking the withdrawal of 
vietnamese occupation forces from cambodia 
the third resistance force is the khmer rouge which took power 
in 1975 and killed an estimated 1 million of their countrymen with 
fanatic agrarian policies before vietnam invaded and drove them into 
the jungles in late 1978 
china is the main supplier of arms to the khmer rouge which 
receives no us support 
fitzwater said bush told chinese premier li peng on sunday that 
the united states rejects a dominant role for the khmer rouge in any 
future cambodian government 
li repeated chinas position that vietnam should withdraw all its 
troops and that sihanouk should head a fourparty coalition 
government which would include the three resistance groups and the 
vietnambacked phnom penh government li said no single party should 
dominate the coalition 
fitzwater said he could not recall any discussion between bush 
and li on the question of chinese arms supplies to the khmer rouge 
china tentatively has agreed to end arms shipments to the guerrillas 
if vietnam fulfills a pledge to withdraw all its troops by september 
the mercurial sihanouk who is noted for his frequent quarrels 
with his resistance partners arrived at bushs villa after a 
limousine ride from his own residence about 100 yards away 
the prince was greeted by us embassy officials and assistant 
secretary of state gaston sigur but stood outside bushs villa for 
about 10 minutes apparently reluctant to enter until the president 
appeared at the door 
when bush showed up sihanouk greeted him warmly and they went 
inside together 
sihanouk was driven from the cambodian throne in 1970 in a coup 
he claimed was engineered by the central intelligence agency then 
strongly antiamerican he returned to his homeland in 1975 when the 
khmer rouge gained power but was immediately placed under house 
arrest 
sihanouk fled cambodia when vietnam invaded and has spent the 
past decade wandering in exile in beijing north korea and paris he 
has been living at the diaoyutai guest house here for more than a 
month 
last month he resumed presidency of the threeparty resistance 
one year after he quit in anger over alleged khmer rouge attacks on 
his troops he has since directed recent peace negotiations with 
vietnam and the phnom penh government

chinas staterun media gave president bushs 
visit unprecedented coverage broadcasting the first live interview 
of a foreign leader in china and portraying the new president as a 
man of the people 
the twoday visit was frontpage news on all of the countrys 
major newspapers sunday morning and it led the nations radio 
broadcasts throughout the day 
in an unusual move stations carried a broadcast of bush speaking 
in english to a welcoming banquet a chinese translation followed 
the visit also led the nationwide television news on saturday and 
sunday nights on sunday the broadcast showed bush shaking hands 
warmly and exchanging toasts with chinese leader deng xiaoping bush 
was also seen meeting premier li peng and communist party chief zhao 
ziyang 
the news also broadcast pictures of bush during and after his 
television interview 
with many thanks the president wrote to china central 
television as the camera zoomed in the biggest audience ive ever 
had by far 
as with all chinese reports sensitive topics were dropped from 
the written copy chinese media made no mention of bushs call for 
respect for individual rights and his opposition to arms sales in 
regions of the world marked by conflict the references however 
veiled were to us hopes for greater personal freedoms in china 
and that the nation stop selling arms in the middle east 
still the coverage was exhaustive 
the englishlanguage service of the xinhua news agency churned 
out about 30 stories and one exclusive interview with the president 
in less than 24 hours 
the media blitz is an indication of beijings hopes for even 
better ties with washington it also is a sign of growing chinese 
curiosity in the united states 
finally it shows the chinese leaderships fascination with 
george bush himself a man they describe as an old friend and 
who they openly supported in last years presidential election 
a waving bush beamed from the front page of the peoples daily 
the official organ of the chinese communist party and the nations 
biggest paper printing 4 million copies a day it ran three stories 
on the presidential visit 
the beijing daily the main newspaper for the capital portrayed 
the new president as a man of the people 
if the visit wasnt such a short one maybe president george 
bush and his wife would ride their flying pigeon bicyles once 
again to tiananmen square the report said 
the reference was to bushs 13month sojourn in beijing as head 
of the us liaison office in 197475 
at that time the story said he and his wife barbara 
often rode their bikes along the big and small roads of beijing for 
exercise to directly understand chinese society and have more 
contact with the people 
in an editorial the peoples daily said bush has put clean 
government and cooperation with congress on the top of his 
agenda an analysis last week said the new president has already 
walked out from under ronald reagans shadow 
but the top item in the media blitz was bushs 15minute 
interview on china central television 
ive spoke to the american people about a new breeze blowing 
bush said in his opening statement before the interview began 
china was one of the first nations to feel this breeze 
sitting in front of a painting of scenic guilin bush smiled 
often as he answered questions mainly about trade relations with 
china 
the questions were asked in english and appeared in chinese as 
subtitles along the bottom of the screen a state department 
interpreter translated for the president 
this is the first live interview ever with a foreign leader 
said an editor earlier sunday were pretty excited about it here 
were expecting at least 100 million people to be watching

everywhere george bush went on sunday he ran into 
old chinese friends from chairman deng xiaoping to the fellow who 
used to cut his hair and his onetime tennis partner 
with deng bush engaged in casual chatter and shook off the old 
chairmans suggestion that they get together for a game of bridge 
some time 
youre too good said bush he lived in china during 197475 
as head of the us liaison office in beijing before establishment 
of ussino diplomatic ties 
bush stopped at the international club to have a word with a 
mr wong the tennis pro who bush claimed has been quoted in 
the newspapers back home as saying that he used to beat bush 
regularly at tennis 
i had to stop off and talk to him about that story bush said 
in later apologizing to the staff at the american embassy for being 
late 
he said he also had wanted to look up his barber at the 
international club a meeting place for foreigners in china 
the barber li bo now assistant manager of the club said bush 
sends the club greeting cards every new year and christmas were 
old friends he told the official xinhua news agnecy 
mrs bush practiced chinese tai qi exercises at the club the 
agency said 
enroute from the club to the embassy bush used a loudspeaker to 
shout thank you from his limousine to chinese crowds congregated 
along the way 
at the embassy he said he was delighted to have run into 
several of our chinese friends coworkers that worked with 
barabara and me right in this very house 
in the courtyard on the way out bush paused to pose with a group 
of american cub scouts and brownies who had waited in the breeze for 
more than an hour 
who are these kids someone asked 
replied their adult leader frozen brownies 
bushs most emotional reunion came at the pulpit of the 
chongwenmen christian church where the rev yin jizeng led the 
services yin had baptized the bushs daughter dorothy when the 
family lived in beijing 
from the pulpit bush recalled those days he said he used to 
arrive at sunday services on his flying pigeon bicycle instead of 
at the head of a flashing 20car motorcade that carried him on 
sunday 
back then only foreigners could attend church services in 
bejing sunday 1400 worshippers crowded into the octogonal church 
china has a billion people 4 million of them are protestants 
when bush pulled in at the international club a handful of 
americans awaited him outside they broke into song god bless 
america 
among them symbolic of the new china and the new relationship 
with the united states was jack law a poultry geneticist from 
colorado state university who said he was involved in a joint 
business venture to teach the chinese how to raise their own 
breeding chickens the chinese must import breeders now but in a 
few years will be raising 10 million of them he said 
bush kidded the staff at the embassy about the exhaustive 
preparations that are made when a president comes calling 
i know something about a visit from a president he said 
we had one when i was out here before this was an embassy and i 
sure was glad to see him go 
the visiting president in bushs past case was gerald r ford 
and if that wasnt enough bush added in reference to the 
former globetrotting secretary of state we survived two visits 
from henry kissinger 
that was the sort of day it was for the visiting american 
president lighthearted interludes between bouts of diplomacy 
when barbara bush who had gone off by herself to see the 
forbidden city joined him for lunch at the great hall of the 
people bush was just finishing shaking the hands of some chinese 
potentates he saw her and shook hers too 
how do you do he asked her with artificial formality 
she gave him a look and a friendly pat on the back 
with tiny chairman deng who comes up about to bushs midriff 
the talk was exceptionally casual 
deng is famous for his interest in playing bridge during the 
cultural revolution when he was ousted from power he passed his 
days at a bridge table 
deng told bush it is a sport they have in common he challenged 
the president to a game sometime 
bush youre too good 
dengits hard to say we havent played together but even if 
we play bridge together it will be a friendly game 
bush i gave up bridge a long time ago too complicated too 
difficult you are the expert 
then they went off to one of those big chinese luncheon banquets 
afterward as he hurried down the steps of the great hall to his 
limousine bush was asked how it went at lunch 
ate too much was the cryptic reply

the federal reserve boards decision last week 
to boost its key lending rate to combat inflation is likely to be 
followed by further credittightening moves and even higher interest 
rates many analysts believe 
they say the central banks move to increase the discount rate by 
a halfpercentage point to 7 percent on friday came too late and was 
too mild to effectively quell an inflation spiral and that further 
steps to cool the overheating economy will be necessary 
the fed is signaling that its definitely trying to encourage 
higher rates in order to fight the inflationary pressure said 
donald ratajczak of the economic forecasting center at georgia state 
university 
the only question is whether theyre signaling a little late 
and a little timidly he said they definitely are late and a 
halfpoint increase is a little timid 
boosting the discount rate the fee the central bank charges for 
shortterm loans to banks is the strongest signal the fed can send 
of its concern about inflation 
the fed also has been employing more subtle credittightening 
moves for the past year reducing the availability of cash and thus 
driving up the interest rates that banks charge when making loans 
major banks last week boosted their prime rate charged to the 
most creditworthy commercial customers for the second time in two 
weeks to 115 percent as lenders continue to pass along their higher 
costs for funds 
a variety of lending rates covering everything from home 
mortgages to new cars are expected to ratchet upward as a result of 
the latest round of fed tightening and the pattern is expected to 
repeat itself 
until the fed sees some clear evidence that the economy is 
slowing down it is going to continue to tighten said economist 
david wyss of data resources inc in lexington mass it believes 
the economy is running too fast inflation is accelerating and its 
going to put on the brakes but it takes awhile for the brakes to 
work 
higher interest rates are used to gradually moderate economic 
growth in an effort to avoid the higher prices caused by tight labor 
markets and supply bottlenecks 
concern about inflation heightened last week after the labor 
department reported that consumer prices were up 06 percent in 
january the biggest increase in two years earlier reports showed 
wholesale prices were up 1 percent last month and indicated the 
economy has yet to slow down in response to the feds efforts to 
maneuver a socalled soft landing to the 6yearold economic 
expansion 
ratajczak said that with inflation unlikely to flag in the near 
future interest rates are bound nowhere but up 
i think were going to see some more bad inflation numbers and 
i think were going to see some higher interest rates he said 
cumulatively the higher interest rates will slow down the 
economy 
a similar theme was sounded by economist david jones of aubrey g 
lanston amp co in new york who said the feds latest action brought 
it at best roughly even with the inflation curve 
the inflation numbers will continue to show a tendency to 
accelerate and it will require further fed tightening steps jones 
said 
most economists are expecting inflation this year to be in the 
range of 5 percent to 55 percent up from 44 percent in the last 
two years while still far short of the doubledigit levels of the 
1970s the current inflation rates have been labeled 
unacceptable by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
if inflation emerges i think a recession will move up on us 
much more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will be 
a prolonged one he warned in congressional testimony last week 
wyss said that while boosting interest rates is not the ideal 
cure for inflation its the only lever the fed has 
i dont think they have much alternative but to pull it

first lady barbara bush returning sunday to 
favorite sites in the old imperial palace patted an ancient 
republican elephant statue for luck and asked that heavyhanded 
chinese guards go easier on photographers with her 
during the rushed onehour tour of the vast palace complex mrs 
bush said she missed the leisurely pace of her visits there in 
197475 when president george bush was stationed in beijing as us 
liaison officer 
im glad id seen it before she said as she strode across a 
wide stonepaved plaza between towering goldroofed halls of the 
forbidden city now called the palace museum 
before i used to ride my bike over give someone 2 cents and 
spend the afternoon with a houseguest she said the 2 cents was 
the bike parking fee 
mrs bush greeted a familiar bronze statue of a kneeling elephant 
near the palaces rear gate with delight crying out theres my 
republican elephant 
do you think its good luck to touch it she asked her 
escort museum director yang xin when he nodded smiling she 
reached out and stroked its tusk 
she also stopped to admire a pine tree in the palace garden with 
speckled silver bark saying its really very unusual i used to 
know its name 
hundreds of chinese tourists kept to the sides by security 
guards watched bemused and curious as mrs bushs entourage of 
about 100 guards aides and journalists walked the more than 15 
miles of the complex 
oh so the presidents wife is coming said a gaptoothed 
peasant from northwest china who was visiting beijing for the first 
time with a group of friends no i dont recognize her name 
chinese security was heavy inside the forbidden city one guard 
slammed a white house photographer carol powers facefirst into a 
door as he tried to maneuver her back from mrs bush 
mrs bush said to her escorts ask them to calm down 
referring to the security guards this girls job is to take my 
picture and she got hit she works for my husband 
mrs bush said later that ms powers was not hurt but she warned 
other photographers running to take her picture to be careful 
calling out i dont want to worry about you like im your 
mother 
mrs bush wearing a blue suit by american designer arnold 
scaasi lowheeled shoes and her trademark pearls stopped to see a 
new exhibit about the life of pu yi chinas last emperor who was 
the subject of the awardwinning 1987 movie the last emperor 
the exhibit in two faded wooden halls contains pu yis 
englishmade bicycle piano and other personal memorabilia 
when yang complimented her on her youthful appearance the 
63yearold mrs bush laughed heartily and said im in high 
spirits not young 
she joked that she would have qualified to attend a banquet one 
18thcentury chinese emperor gave in the palace for people 60 and

in a guide for rearing an unbiased child a 
group of educators says the place to start is with a 2yearold just 
beginning to notice that people come in different shapes colors and 
sexes 
the advice continues dont assume simple exposure to diversity 
is enough to kill the seeds of prejudice but on the other hand 
dont pretend such differences do not exist 
the 65000member national association for the education of young 
children group says teachers and parents likewise should not pretend 
that differences dont matter but rather explore them fully through 
discussion stories books games and multiracial persona dolls 
with a range of physical characteristics and disabilities 
those people who say i dont notice if a person is brown or 
green or purple exemplify the colorblind approach says louise 
dermansparks it arose as the progressive approach against racial 
bigotry but it doesnt work 
dermansparks author of the teacher guidebook and a professor of 
early childhood development at pacific oaks college in pasadena 
calif recommends discussing with children the differences they see 
and the ways people are the same and different 
talking about differences doesnt encourage prejudice she 
says in fact responding positively can discourage it it is a 
lack of response or a negative one that can promote bias 
most attempts to teach tolerance and understanding are aimed at 
older students but in antibias curriculum dermansparks cites 
research findings that by age 4 children to a large extent have 
internalized gender stereotypes racial bias and fear of disabled 
people thus her focus on toddlers preschoolers and kindergarteners 
preprejudice can appear as early as age 2 when a child runs 
away from a classmate in a leg brace or refuses to hold a black 
childs hand insisting it is dirty according to the manual it 
says such children need special attention to overcome their fears 
and misconceptions 
teachers are admonished not to ignore or try to excuse 
discriminatory behavior if children insult or exclude one another 
on the basis of race sex handicap or ethnic origin the manual 
advises immediately intervene to explain comfort and set firm 
standards of acceptable behavior 
one of the thorniest problems addressed in the teachers guide is 
what to do when parents transmit racist or sexist messages to their 
children among the examples given a parent says she doesnt want 
her child sitting next to any mexican kids or a white parent says he 
doesnt want his daughter playing with a black doll because that 
will lead to interracial dating and marriage 
the easiest response says dermansparks is to simply say all 
children in the classroom sit with everyone and children can play 
with any doll they want but the easiest approach is ultimately 
the least effective because parents dont change and kids receive 
mixed messages she says 
the best but admittedly risky way to handle such a situation is 
to try to talk to the parents about their fears and prejudices 
according to the manual if no agreement is reached it recommends 
calling a parents meeting and airing all points of view before 
making a decision on which if any antibias activities to curtail 
a companion parents brochure available free from the 
association describes in detail how to respond to a young childs 
sometimes awkward questions when asked why is that girl in a 
wheelchair a parent should reply shes using a wheelchair 
because her legs are not strong enough to walk the wheelchair helps 
her move around 
inappropriate responses would be shh its not nice to ask or 
ill tell you another time the brochure says such responses do 
not satisfy a childs curiosity or teach him or her how to interact 
comfortably with a disabled person the brochure says 
a parent asked why is jamals skin so dark should not merely 
answer that his skin color doesnt matter we are all the same 
underneath rather toddlers should be told that jamals skin is 
dark brown because his mom and dad have dark brown skin and 
preschoolers given a simple explanation of melanin the substance 
that determines skin color in humans 
teachers are given similar guidance in one example a 
studentteacher tells a boy in a swing what wonderful big 
circles you are making to a girl in the next swing she says 
be careful you might hurt yourself the teacher then steps in 
saying i think pam is making wonderful big circles too

nearly all of sudans doctors stopped 
working sunday and said they will resign in a week unless the 
government improves conditions to end shortages of basic medical 
supplies 
many people have died due to the lack of soluble insulin in the 
hospitals blankets are torn up and used instead of medical cotton 
how can we work in such conditions said abdulrahman abulkul 
chief of the physicians association of sudan 
he led 1000 of the striking physicians on a march through 
khartoum the capital to present resignations of 2761 doctors at 
the ministry of health he said they represent 983 of the nations 
doctors 
the strike comes as prime minister sadek mahdis government tries 
to meet ultimatums of rebellious military officers and the capital 
is inundated with refugees from the southern civil war many 
refugees are starving and others need medical attention 
the physicians said they are protesting shortages of medical 
supplies such as disposable syringes antibiotics and lifesaving 
medication like the insulin needed to treat high blood sugar levels 
we will not withdraw the resignation until we make sure that 
the implementation of our demands has started abulkul told 
reporters 
he said limited voluntary work would continue and that private 
clinics would be open two hours a day 
abulkul said this east african country needs to spend at least 
24 million to upgrade health conditions this is only for the 
next six months not in the long run he added 
no one can deny the deterioration of the medical services 
said dr abdul hamid alsayed osman an undersecretary of health and 
a physician he said he too would resign if there were no 
improvements 
osman said the government has allocated 25 million for 
medication but he could not explain why there were terrible 
shortages 
refugees fleeing the civil war in the south to 
governmentcontrolled towns apparently have aggravated the need for 
medical supplies and hospital care though abulkul said his 
association has been demanding improvements in health care since 
august 1987 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army took up arms in 1983 
against the moslemdominated government to fight for economic and 
social reforms in the mainly christian and animist south 
on friday mahdi bowed to army demands and promised to seek peace 
with the rebels address domestic problems and change his cabinet 
and foreign policy 
about 150 army officers led by military commander gen fathi 
ahmed ali put the ultimatum to mahdi the officers insist there is 
no threat of a military takeover

it wasnt like the french connection heroin 
bust there was no careening car chase no colorful popeye doyle 
cracking the case 
but agents who smashed a hong kongtochinatown narcotics ring 
last week stumbled onto the largest heroin haul in us history when 
they seized 1 billion worth of the drug packed in hollowedout golf 
cart tires 
this seizure is much bigger than the french connection 
said us attorney andrew j maloney who prosecuted some of the 
cases stemming from the drug ring that inspired the oscarwinning 
1971 film 
the biggest seizure from the whole french connection was 
about 220 pounds but this everybody was amazed by the size of 
this seizure 
federal authorities on the night of feb 20 hit three locations 
in the borough of queens grabbing 828 pounds of 90 percent pure 
heroin from southeast asia enough to supply one out of every five 
us heroin addicts for a year 
the amount of heroin was so big that when assistant fbi director 
james m fox arrived at his office tuesday morning he cautiously 
asked if a radio report he had heard was correct had 300 pounds of 
heroin really been seized 
no replied a colleague with a straight face it was 828 
pounds we didnt know if we were going to get just a couple of 
pounds of heroin or what when we went in fox said three days 
later what a way to start the week 
eighteen suspects were arrested in new york city and 13 in 
detroit los angeles san francisco chicago singapore hong kong 
and canada seized along with the drugs was 3 million cash 
fox putting the seizure in perspective said the fbi had taken 
in just over 500 pounds of heroin in all of 1988 the celebrated 
pizza connection case in which heroin was distributed nationwide 
through pizzerias produced 18 convictions but no major drug seizure 
operation white mare named for the heroins color and its 
street name horse started with an informants tip that 
chinatown businessman peter woo one of the 31 people arrested was 
involved in drug trafficking court papers indicated 
when the probe ended 18 months later more than 100 law 
enforcement officials were involved and the fbi had taped more than 
100 conversations between new york and canada singapore and hong 
kong 
unlike the french connection this was a whole new culture we 
were dealing with said maloney we had hours and hours of 
conversations in part chinese part english different dialects 
as a result the fbi combed its offices across the country for 
chinesespeaking agents to translate the wiretaps complicating the 
language barrier was a code used by the alleged dealers heroin was 
called shrimp or vegetables for example 
they were very careful in their use of the telephone said 
fox the times they used the phone they were very conscious of 
what they said 
but there were tipoffs that the end was near for the suspects 
who are accused of shipping drugs from southeast asias golden 
triangle via hong kong to los angeles where the heroin was 
trucked across the country 
wiretaps indicated that woo 71 a prominent businessman in 
manhattans chinatown believed he was under surveillance two other 
busts of the operation turned up 183 pounds of heroin in boston and 
more than 100 pounds in los angeles 
this guy peter woo is hurting said fox his friends are 
out all the heroin plus the money i think his people are going to 
be kind of upset dont you 
while a bust of this size will hurt the heroin trade maloney 
acknowledged it was no death blow 
were making heavy dents but theres always somebody waiting 
to step in and take over said maloney they keep spitting it 
out as fast as we make seizures 
which means this recordsetting bust will someday be surpassed 
i hate to say no i guess you have to assume there always a 
bigger fish in the lake said fox but i think its going to be 
a long time before that happens

this bold new city of the south is 
raising a stink in an attempt to shed its reputation as one of the 
smelliest places in the nation 
paper mills produce odor and chemical companies use a smelly 
byproduct from the mills terpene to produce flavorings and 
perfumes 
the combination creates an odor which sometimes is totally 
unbearable said ann shorstein deputy chief administrative 
officer in mayor tommy hazouris office 
when hazouri took office in 1987 he pledged an odorfree city 
within two years although officials say he may have been overly 
optimistic they say conditions have improved particularly since 
the city council last march passed a toughened antiodor bill under 
it the city has negotiated with companies about reducing their 
emissions 
its even fined its own sewer plant 
not everyone in this north florida city of 600000 agrees about 
the extent of the problem 
george robbins president of scm glidco organics corp one of 
the companies that has run afoul of the antiodor campaign conceded 
that part of jacksonvilles reputation as a smelly city is earned 
but he said part of that is cities competing with 
jacksonville for growth couldnt find much else to be negative 
about frankly jacksonvilles got a lot going for it 
he called the odor issue a cosmetic personal preference 
problem saying the more important problem is health hazards in 
the air such as ozone 
countered ms shorstein we have people who have been driven 
inside by the odors to the point they are not even capable of 
opening their doors or going into their back yard 
homeowner jeanne oster put it more bluntly last year about the 
time the new antistink law was passed ill tell you exactly what 
the air smells like its like being locked in a portolet at the 
county fair theres no escape 
there were 4200 odor complaints last year up from 2165 in 
1987 before the new ordinance was passed 
i dont think that says that odors got worse robbins said 
theres a heightened public awareness contrary to what the number 
of complaint says i think things are getting better 
robbins also pointed out that more than half of last years 
complaints were not about the paper mills and chemical companies 
in fact robbins said the citys sewage plant got more 
complaints than his company the city recently fined the sewage 
plant 28357 
as for scm glidco robbins said the company has spent 15 
million to 2 million on odor reduction changing equipment and 
procedures at the plant scm glidco is one of several companies 
negotiating with the city over their efforts to come into compliance 
with the law 
under the civil section of the ordinance the city can impose 
fines of up to 10000 per day per violation and can order 
corrections of problems if negotiations fail the laws criminal 
sanctions were recently thrown out by a judge as unconstitutionally 
vague 
people can report objectionable odors by calling a 24hour 
hotline if a company receives five complaints within a 90day 
period it can be cited 
robbins said the city needs to establish objective standards to 
what is malodorous for now an odor is deemed objectionable if 
someone complains 
all we need is somebody tell us that these compounds and these 
concentrations are by legal definition malodorous and you emit them 
were going to get you he said weve had complaints about 
emitting sweetsmelling odor 
many view the odor as the price of having industries that provide 
jobs ms shorstein sees it from a different perspective 
its hard to attract the kind of businesses we are looking for 
when someone flies into this community and at 4000 feet they are 
smelling the odor she said

nearly 11000 afghan troops have joined the resistance and 
surrendered large quantities of weapons during recent fighting 
around afghanistan

guerrilla rocket attack on the eastern city of jalalabad and that 
another civilian died in a similar attack in northeastern laghman 
province 
the guerrillacontrolled afghan news agency said 68 afghan 
soldiers were killed and about 90 wounded in fighting around 
afghanistan since tuesday 
and the soviet news agency tass said afghan soldiers killed 97 
guerrillas and captured two major ammunition depots in fighting 
saturday

criticizing the moslem guerrillas for forming a governmentinexile 
in pakistan where they are based and for predicting they will soon 
take power in afghanistan 
the statement the first official afghan reaction to the interim 
government said it violated the unmediated accord that led the 
soviet union to withdraw its 115000 troops from afghanistan 
tass also quoted the soviet newspaper izvestia as saying the 
guerrillas plan to attack kabul in a bid to topple the moscowbacked 
regime of president najib it said they also plan to attack 
jalalabad and hope to install their government there 
none of the reports could be confirmed independently 
if the afghan military defections are confirmed they would be 
the largest reported in the war between the usbacked guerrillas 
and the communist regime in kabul the afghan army is estimated to 
have 50000 soldiers 
a spokesman for the jamiatiislami guerrilla group said sunday 
that three afghan regiments or more than 10000 men defected to 
the insurgents in northern takhar and badakhshan provinces on feb

said another 101 government soldiers surrendured during a guerrilla 
attack wednesday near mazarisharif the capital of northern balkh 
province 
earlier this month a council of afghan guerrilla leaders met in 
pakistan and formed a governmentinexile they called on foreign 
countries to recognize the proposed government which hopes to take 
over if kabul is overthrown 
tass quoted the afghan foreign ministry as saying the interim 
government was formed under the direct pressure of pakistani 
secret services and their imperialist patrons in violation of the 
un charter 
tass said the ministry described this move as an interference 
in domestic affairs of the sovereign and nonaligned state 
afghanistans major cities are under siege by the guerrillas who 
reportedly control 90 percent of the countryside 
guerrilla field commanders have said they oppose major offensives 
on urban areas that would result in high civilian casualties

tearful armenians laid flowers before pictures of 
their dead brethren sunday to mark the anniversary of three days of 
ethnic rioting that killed at least 32 people a year ago and 
galvanized a nationalist movement 
events have shown that we cant automatically trust the 
authorities the time for automatic trust has passed activist 
eduard gevandov told a crowd of several hundred gathered at the 
steps of moscows armenian church 
authorities sanctioned the gathering held to commemorate rioting 
in the azerbaijani city of sumgait on feb 2829 and march 1 last 
year 
speaker arkady semyonov called them three black and 
unforgettable days 
soviet officials say 26 armenians and six azerbaijanis died in 
the violence but armenians insist the toll was much higher 
photocopies of pictures of victims and their death certificates 
were displayed on a wall of the brick church armenians laid lilies 
red carnations and tulips before the pictures and raised candles as 
funeral music played 
banners raised at the gathering demanded that political leaders 
of azerbaijan a republic neighboring armenia in the soviet unions 
southern caucasus region be found responsible for the rioting and 
that soviet authorities denounce the violence 
speakers criticized the soviet press for what they said was an 
unfair characterization of armenians as extremists 
a resolution called for authorities to recognize the rioting as 
an act of genocide construct a monument to the victims in moscow 
and release members of the activist karabakh committee 
the sumgait riots broke out several weeks after thousands of 
armenians staged protests demanding annexation of the 
nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan 
nagornokarabakh is populated predominantly by ethnic armenians 
and they consider it to be historically a part of armenia even 
though soviet officials turned it over to azerbaijan in the 1920s 
kremlin authorities have rejected the annexation demands 
most azerbaijanis are moslem and most armenians are christian 
but father tiran gureghian of the armenian church in moscow told the 
crowd the problem is not religious not political but purely 
national and territorial 
almaz yestekov one of the founders of islam and democracy a new 
movement in the traditionally moslem republics of soviet central 
asia appealed for understanding between armenians and azerbaijanis 
he said he had appealed to azerbaijanis for calm in an interview 
with foreign radio stations 
we are children of the same tribe roots of the same tree 
yestekov said 
after the deadly riots in february ethnic unrest erupted into 
violence again in armenia and azerbaijan in june july and november 
more than 60 people were killed and in january the kremlin imposed 
direct rule over nagornokarabakh 
under the direct rule the regions local legislature was 
dissolved and a special commission was given the power to suspend 
all local governing councils and administrative bodies any informal 
organizations and oversee the media health and education 
the armenian protests began as an appeal to president mikhail s 
gorbachev for annexation and were fueled by his reform policies 
when moscow authorities rejected the appeals the movement grew 
to incorporate economic cultural and environmental grievances some 
activists called for outright independence for armenia 
when gorbachev visited armenia following the dec 7 earthquake 
there that killed 25000 people authorities began rounding up 
members of the karabakh committee who had been among the organizers 
of large demonstrations and general strikes 
gevandov said the events showed authorities were incapable of 
controlling crowds motivated by anything other than slogans they 
themselves place before the people 
it is impossible to build a national structure without the 
cement of truth and sincerity he said

the democratic chairman of the senate budget 
committee told the nations governors sunday that were fresh out 
of cash here in washington and warned them there is more fiscal 
pain ahead for the states 
sen james sasser of tennessee disclaimed any intention to 
launch an assault on president bush or his budget but added 
that the white house was following a most unorthodox approach to 
the deficit negotiations 
sasser was the principal speaker at the opening session of the 
midwinter meeting of the national governors association 
the administration was not represented at the session because 
richard darman white house budget director declined an invitation 
to appear 
all the governors understand we have to take our fair share of 
cuts to deal with deficit reduction and weve done that said 
democratic gov james blanchard of michigan 
but he went on to say that the states were hard pressed to deal 
with new obligations mandated by the federal government without 
funds to pay for them 
we cant take continued mandated automatic expenditures he 
said 
gov gerald baliles of virginia a democratic who is nga 
chairman opened the session by pointing out that the federal budget 
item for interest on the debt now exceeds spending on all domestic 
discretionary programs 
sasser disputed some of the economic assumptions made by the new 
administration particularly the forecast that interest rates will 
decline to 55 percent in 1990 
sasser said that while the administration predicts a balanced 
budget by 1993 the congressional budget office forecasts a 75 
billion deficit for the same year 
blanchard a former member of congress said he was confused by 
the process being used to reach a budget agreement 
were confused ourselves this year said sasser this is a 
most unorthodox approach 
the tennessee senator said the administration had simply left 
many budget areas blank and left it to congress to suggest where 
cuts ought to be made 
its a little like you going to your state legislatures with 
your budget and just taking about half of it and throwing it up in 
the air and saying ok fellow here it is you solve it 
he said that in his negotiations with darman we sort of shadow 
box around on this program and that program its a very unusual 
budget process 
sasser said that while bush is asking for a lineitem veto a 
budgetary tool that many governors have he refuses to offer the 
congress this year a lineitem budget 
the sad reality of our fiscal circumstances is that theres 
substantial pain to be portioned out to the american people and im 
sorry to say that the portion of that pain likely to fall to state 
and local government is once again very substantial said sasser

the opposition labor party is more popular than the 
governing conservative party for the first time since october 1986 
according to an opinion poll published in the observer newspaper 
sunday 
the harris poll suggests prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservatives have fallen six points in the last month to 41 
percent while labor has improved five points to 42 percent its 
highest level since before the 1983 general election 
a gallup poll published in the sunday telegraph has labor under 
leader neil kinnock even with the conservatives each with 35 
percent 
both the independent observer and the conservative sunday 
telegraph suggested labors gains were at the conservatives expense 
both polls indicated support for the centrist social and liberal 
democratic party was holding steady at 10 percent 
harris said support for the splinter social democratic party was 
little changed at 3 percent and gallup said it was 4 percent 
the newspapers said dissatisfaction with the government has 
probably resulted from its proposed radical overhaul of the mostly 
free national health service high inflation interest rates and 
mortgage rates and plans to privatize the countrys water industry 
on saturday thousands of young people rallied in london in a 
generally peaceful protest of government plans to freeze financial 
aid for university students and institute a system of loans 
the marchers estimated by police at 8000 grouped on the 
victoria embankment beside the thames in central london then made 
their way past whitehalls government office buildings and across 
lambeth bridge to the south bank of the thames and a rally in 
kensington park 
the route was heavily policed because a similar demonstration in 
november ended in battles between officers and students 
beginning in 1990 the government plans to freeze the existing 
student grants and introduce student loans to make up the growing 
gap between the grants and actual costs details of the plans have 
not been announced 
the harris research center poll of 1027 britons was conducted 
wednesday and thursday before the results were known of two special 
elections for vacant parliamentary seats no margin of error was 
given 
the conservative party narrowly retained one of its safest 
parliamentary seats the wealthy richmond district in northern 
england although its majority tumbled thursday from nearly 20000 
votes to 2600 
labor kept its seat at pontypridd in south wales 
the sunday telegraph did not provide gallups sample size or 
margin of error and did not say when the survey was conducted

haitis latest government headed by lt gen 
prosper avril has continued the human rights abuses of its 
predecessors three human rights organizations charged sunday 
the persistence of serious human rights violations suggests an 
ongoing refusal by the military to relinquish power to an elected 
civilian government the groups report said 
the 159page report issued by americas watch the national 
coalition for haitian refugees and caribbean rights noted that 
avrils 5monthold government has vowed to hold elections and 
promote human rights 
but it said peasant organizations trade unions and church 
activists are still subject to military and paramilitary violence 
and that demonstrations and outspoken critics are also regularly 
targeted the avril government has never prosecuted those involved 
in political violence it added 
it also said that the government rather than establishing an 
independent electoral council has proposed a procedure for 
selecting a new electoral commission that would be highly 
susceptible to military control 
since the report was compiled avril has agreed to set up an 
independent electoral council as recommended by a forum of 
political and civic leaders in a decree thursday the government 
said the council would organize and set a date for elections and 
supervise the vote 
avril assumed the presidency sept 17 in a coup led by 
rankandfile soldiers demanding democratic reforms the coup ousted 
lt gen henri namphy whose rule saw widespread repression 
including mass killings 
the three human rights groups said their report was based on 
seven missions to haiti since november 1987 
haiti has been racked by political strife for decades 
particularly during the reign of presidentforlife francois papa

while czechoslovak playwright vaclav havel 
is confined to a prague jail authorities in poland are not only 
allowing performances of his plays but the prime minister showed up 
for the opening 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowskis appearance at the theater 
saturday illustrates the different paths the east bloc countries are 
taking in confronting their critics 
while czechoslovakias communist party leader milos jakes has 
chosen to crack down on dissent rakowskis government has started 
negotiations on political and economic reforms with the opposition 
it once tried to crush 
many western countries have criticized the feb 21 decision of a 
prague court to sentence havel to nine months in jail on charges of 
inciting citizens to take part in a banned demonstration last month 
and obstructing police officers 
but nowhere in the east bloc has havels jailing aroused such 
interest among officials and anger among independent intellectuals 
as in poland 
even the decision to allow the performance of the highly 
political and critical works is a reversal of the authorities 
attitude toward havel whose works have been published here only in 
the underground press 
havels plays first were staged in poland in late 1981 but 
production was suspended after only 12 performances when authorities 
imposed martial law that december to suppress the independent 
solidarity trade union movement 
filmmaker feliks falk who directed the current production of two 
oneact havel plays the audience the the protest said he 
has tried for a long time to get permission to stage the plays 
the cast began rehearsing in january and havel originally was 
invited to the premiere he said 
its just a coincidence that havel is in prison falk said in 
an interview for us and for the actors of course the 
performance is very important because of havel and because the 
plays are very good 
rakowskis appearance added a dramatic twist to the performance 
of the two oneact plays 
assistant theater director krzysztof rudzinski blanched and tried 
to stop a young activist from selling underground copies of 
thriller a collection of havels political essays in the 
theater lobby 
rakowski witnessed the scene as he arrived 
but the prime minister ignored the fuss and calmly took a regular 
seat in the theater five rows away from adam michnik a leading 
polish opposition theorist who like havel has spent years in jail 
for his writings and political activities 
for two hours the audience was spellbound first by the 
audience the tale of a simple brewery worker being pressured by 
police to inform on a writer whom authorities have forced to work in 
the brewery as punishment for his political activities 
it shows the drama of the average man historian bronislaw 
geremek said during intermission 
but it was the protest that particularly touched the audience 
of officials and intellectuals 
the story concerns the behavior of an official writer who appeals 
to an opposition writer to arrange a petition against the detention 
of a musician involved with his daughter but the writer balks when 
asked to sign the protest the opposition already had formulated 
as the crowd applauded at the end of the play michnik jumped on 
stage to read a personal handwritten appeal to czech authorities to 
release havel but his protest was drowned by music blaring through 
loudspeakers 
michnik has met havel several times at clandestine meetings of 
polish and czechoslovak political activists in the mountains along 
the border that separates the two countries 
he called havel a friend and symbol like nobel peace prize 
winners andrei sakharov from the soviet union and polands 
solidarity leader lech walesa 
he urged competent authorities to stop repression and urged 
the czechoslovak leadership to take the same road as other east 
european countries are taking reconciliation with the nation 
havel was arrested jan 16 during an attempt with other 
opposition activists to lay flowers in memory of jan palach a 
student who burned himself to death 20 years ago to protest the 1968 
sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia 
polish opposition groups quickly rose to his defense 
the national leadership of solidarity the independent 
polishczech solidarity group and the polish chapter of the 
international writers pen club all have appealed to authorities 
to release havel 
the polish government declined to comment on his jailing saying 
it was an internal affair of czechoslovakia

vip and gigi the couple everyones talking about 
at the metropolitan district commissions zoos are getting along 
famously and the gorillas handlers are upbeat about the prospects 
of a fruitful relationship 
a computerarranged tryst brought vip from a texas zoo last month 
to replace gigis old flame sam after the spark went out of their 
lives and three years passed without any offspring 
zoo officials hope vip 9 and gigi 16 will produce a family of 
lowland gorillas to inhabit a new 26 million facility at a 
revitalized franklin park zoo which once ranked among the 10 worst 
zoos in the nation 
vip and gigi are due to make their first public appearance as a 
couple in their temporary digs at the stone zoo in stoneham on 
monday but the two have been warming up to each other during about 
a halfdozen introductory meetings over the last week 
both gorillas have spent their entire lives in captivity they 
were matched by the species survival program of the american 
association of zoological parks and aquariums which traced their 
family trees to make sure they were not closely related 
after an initial getacquainted period of slamming walls with 
their fists the two 250pound gorillas began chasing each other in 
circles and each chase ended with the two resting closer and closer 
together 
behaviorist deborah shildkraudt said the reaction was natural 
the gorillas were just learning to relinquish the personal space 
many wild beasts demand

two years ago maria andy lived in a remote 
ecuadoran orphanage where she owned two dresses ate soup every 
night and crawled around dragging her two crippled legs behind her 
these days maria is an active secondgrader at an elementary 
school just outside boston she celebrated her ninth birthday last 
week in the home she shares with james and joyce kidd who have 
cared for her since september 1987 and plan to adopt her 
it is a far cry from how she began life shortly after birth 
maria was rescued by nuns who spotted her just as her parents were 
about to throw her in a bonfire because of her deformities 
she was brought to boston in may 1987 for leg surgery under the 
sponsorship of por cristo a brocktonbased charity organization 
the kidds took her in after reading about her in a boston newspaper 
her legs were amputated and she was fitted with prostheses she 
defied doctors who doubted she would ever walk by taking her first 
steps shortly after getting her artificial legs 
maria said she was scared when the director of the orphanage 
told her she was going to the united states i cried she said 
i didnt want to go 
now maria said she has nightmares about returning to the 
orphanage high in the andes where she slept in a room filled with 
other children and never celebrated a birthday 
she is fluent in english and has a roomful of toys and stuffed 
animals many of them elephants because the kidds are active in the 
republican party she has a best friend rebecca at school and her 
favorite class is spelling she watches the the brady bunch on 
tv every afternoon 
she walks easily on two prosthetic legs with the aid of a single 
crutch and is beginning to take steps without it in fact the only 
clue to marias past is her diet 
chicken 
she eats it for almost every single meal said mrs kidd 33 
a kindergarten teacher i feel like asking frank perdue if he 
wants to use her as a poster child its all she wants to eat 
mrs kidd said she discovered that children in the orphanage were 
allowed chicken only on special holidays once or twice a year 
when she was first brought to childrens hospital in boston 
doctors were unsure if they could do anything except strengthen her 
legs she was born with severe scoliosis or curvature of the spine 
but maria proved strong enough for doctors to decide to amputate her 
legs and fit her with new ones 
maria is still learning to walk without crutches she was up to 
25 steps without crutches when she returned to the hospital last 
summer for spinal fusion surgery she spent five months in a body 
cast and wheelchair 
her new goals she said are to learn to ice skate and ski but 
she said she is still enjoying life with the kidds 
i always wanted a family maria said at the orphanage 
there was one girl who had relatives visit her and i was jealous 
but when asked to describe the very best thing about her new 
life maria was succinct 
chicken she said

arkansas three democrats in the us 
house are divided two against one in a feud about party loyalty 
political philosophy and personalities rep tommy robinsons 
bashing of his national party raises republican hopes that the 
toughtalking former sheriff might change party affiliations 
their words have been so heated that the states democratic party 
leader called saturday for robinson and fellow reps beryl anthony 
and bill alexander to sit down and work out their differences 
but there are apparently no prospects for peace between the 
conservative outspoken robinson and his two colleagues whom he 
labels as too liberal to represent arkansas 
robinson is scheduled to get a personal pitch to switch to the 
gop this week when he meets tuesday afternoon with sen phil gramm 
of texas who defected from the democrats six years ago 
as of last week robinson said that he was still a democrat but 
i can foresee the day when people will be jumping ship right and 
left 
he had strong criticism for his colleagues 
i dont care what those liberals do in washington dc i vote 
the convictions of my constituents here robinson told a chamber 
of commerce banquet friday night in bald knob about 50 miles 
northeast of here 
anthony and alexander are two pigs squealing because they have 
been stuck and dont like it robinson said 
state democratic party chairman james skip rutherford said 
the congressmen have some personal differences that need to be 
resolved 
robinson a thrirdterm congressman fell out with anthony when 
the democratic steering and policy committee denied him a seat last 
month on the education and labor committee of the house 
robinson said the vote was his punishment for appearing last 
november on radio ads supporting fellow armed services committee 
member jack davis rill who was defeated by democrat george 
sangmeister 
anthony an ex officio member of the steering committee chairs 
the democratic congressional campaign committee which raises money 
for house democrats while acknowledging that he told the steering 
committee about robinsons efforts on behalf of a republican 
anthony said robinson is responsible for his own problems 
he is the one who campaigned for a republican he was the one 
who was unloyal said anthony a house member since 1979 
robinson has never been a buddy of alexander whos been in 
congress since 1969 among other issues they have clashed about 
cuba alexander wants to sell arkansas rice to fidel castro while 
robinson distrusts the cuban leader 
alexander said last week that robinson has ruined himself in 
washington because of party disloyalty i dont know what he 
does just mostly run his mouth 
robinson responded the problem with alexander and anthony is 
that they do not understand the arkansas meaning of loyalty to an 
arkansan loyalty is representing the wishes of your constituency i 
consider it disloyal to go to cuba as alexander did 
such exchanges trouble rutherford who said he would be willing 
to mediate the flap 
during a meeting friday rutherford urged robinson not to switch 
parties 
i wanted him to know that as chairman i very much wanted him 
to remain in the party and that we knew he was being heavily 
recruited by the republicans and that there is room here for his 
views rutherford said 
in his own way he is trying to bring the party back to the 
center rutherford said i think theres room to raise 
legitimate questions i think youre seeing a lot of political 
posturing right now which is very much a part of the process

sen phil gramm rtex seeking to ease what 
he called the human tragedy of central americans denied 
political asylum in the united states says he will introduce 
legislation requiring wouldbe refugees to apply before they enter 
this country 
as of last thursday about 625 central americans who had been 
denied asylum were under detention in the 315acre port isabel 
service processing center run by the immigration and naturalization 
service just north of brownsville texas they were awaiting 
deportation 
they have the very real human tragedy of having to walk home 
after spending their worldly goods to get here gramm said its 
not humane i want to let them know if theyre accepted as 
political refugees before they come 
the central americans were detained under a policy that took 
effect last dec 16 denying those who seek polical asylum the right 
to travel within the country while their applications or appeals are 
processed 
gramm in an interview friday said 98 percent of the central 
american refugees who arrive in brownsville are being denied 
political asylum 
having thousands a month come into brownsville creates a huge 
overload many bring communicable diseases that we long ago stopped 
worrying about they have no housing and have been a tremendous 
burden on the local economy gramm said 
under his proposal refugees from el salvador or nicaragua could 
apply for asylum in honduras or mexico 
gramm said he discussed the bill last week with attorney general 
richard thornburgh and is confident of gaining administration 
support gramm said he would introduce the bill tuesday 
under the new policy ins officials are speeding up the review of 
applications while detaining the applicants previously 
applications could take weeks to process and aliens were released on 
their own recognizance while awaited appeals or deportation 
as many as 2000 refugees a week had been crossing the rio grande 
into texas but the number has slowed to a trickle under the new 
policy 
only immigrants who can prove they have suffered political 
persecution are entitled to asylum those who come for economic 
reasons are subject to deportation ins officials say most central 
americans arriving in south texas do not qualify for refugee status

the record weekend freeze caused some of 
the worst crop damage in a decade for central florida vegetable 
growers who supply produce sold across the country growers and 
industry officials said 
but fields farther south and along the coast fared better in the 
cold wave that hit thursday friday and saturday growers and 
industry officials said temperatures moderated sunday 
with a value to florida farmers of more than 11 billion 
annually produce ranks near the states agricultural leader the 
13 billionayear citrus industry which appeared to have suffered 
only minimal damage 
from talking with several growers yesterday we did experience 
quite a bit of damage on the real coldsensitive crops cucumbers 
watermelons and squash and some damage on peppers and tomato 
crops reggie brown spokesman for orlandobased florida fruit and 
vegetable association said sunday 
that damage varies quite a bit with the locality he said 
adding that the tampa bay area the northernmost area where crops 
are in the ground this time of year was hit the worst 
overall this particular cold for the most part has not been 
one that has wiped out a crop with the exception of ruskinpalmetto 
near tampa but appears to be one that has pushed crops back with 
a 25 to 30 percent loss of potential yield brown said in a 
telephone interview from his naplesarea home 
what i see is a disaster roger harloff a palmetto tomato 
grower and packer told the st petersburg times in a story 
published sunday 
tomatoes are the states largest produce crop valued at almost 
490 million in 1987 the latest figures available from the us 
department of agriculture 
elsewhere saturday tampa hit a record low of 31 degrees daytona 
beach had a record low of 29 orlando hit a record 30 and pensacola 
had a record 27 tallahassee in the northern part of the state had 
a record low of 18 
every cucumber in the state of florida is gone from what i 
understand tom burgin a produce broker in plant city told the 
times there wont be any cucumbers for about 60 days 
i had a fellow with 500 acres of cucumbers and peppers in south 
hillsborough county call me this morning to tell me that theyre 
completely gone burgin said and the ruskin tomato people lost 
everything theyre completely wiped out 
the ruskin vegetable corp in hillsborough ships fresh produce to 
some of the largest grocery store chains and terminal markets in 
north america including those in atlanta new york toronto 
boston baltimore pittsburgh los angeles new orleans and st 
louis 
our main suit is tomatoes said bill butler ruskin 
vegetables general manager the damage to the tomato crop was 
considerable ive seen a lot of kill today ive seen total loss in 
some fields and just a little bit in a few fields because they were 
close to the warming water but ive seen at least some damage in 
every field up to total destruction 
butler said the damage was the worst in the 10 years that hes 
worked at ruskin vegetable 
readytopick tomato crops in the vast fields of collier county 
around naples and southern dade county which includes miami fared 
much better said brown 
ironically unseasonably warm weather this winter before the cold 
snap contributed to the losses warm sunny days induced farmers to 
plant early and rapid growth then made plants especially tender and 
more vulnerable to the cold

feeding hay to elk and 
bison starving in this firescarred preserve could do more harm than 
good and even if many animals die the herds are in no danger of 
extinction says the head of the national park service 
the reduction in natural grazing by last summers drought and 
huge fires combined with a severe winter have driven elk and bison 
out of the park into southern montana where the state is allowing 
hunters to kill hundreds of the animals the state claims they carry 
disease that could infect livestock 
in the small town of gardiner mont just north of the park 
starving elk are eating hay donated by sympathetic people along 
with hedges and trees small herds of elk and buffalo have 
congregated in parking lots 
they are skinny and eak said trudi taylor who joined with 
others in town to raise money to feed the animals after one elk died 
in her yard she admits the winter will probably claim older 
animals but hopes to save younger cows that will soon calve 
in this town most of the people make their money off these 
animals at least they could give a little back she said 
referring to the areas popularity with hunters and tourists 
but feeding hay to elk allows diseases to spread among the 
animals when they gather in tight groups at feeding stations park 
service director william penn mott said at a news conference 
saturday at yellowstones headquarters 
and if park rangers started feeding hay to elk in yellowstone 
the expensive practice could go on forever as the animals become 
dependent on it as they have at the national elk refuge at jackson 
wyo south of yellowstone mott said 
mott was sent on a factfinding trip to yellowstone by new 
interior secretary manuel lujan following national publicity about 
the hunting in montana and high mortality in the parks northern elk 
herd the largest migratory elk herd in the world 
mott said one option he thought he could support was to have the 
federal government acquire more winter game range north of the park 
in montana the rocky mountain elk foundation of missoula mont 
announced friday that it will start a special fund toward expanding 
winter range for yellowstones elk herd 
mott also said he will ask the park service and other state and 
federal agencies and conservation groups to help draft a report on 
yellowstones total wildlife management program which he called 
fragmented 
we will look at the total ecosystem and how to best manage 
wildlife he said if land is being overgrazed we should look 
at this 
both elk and bison populations in yellowstone are near alltime 
highs because several mild winters before this year allowed more 
animals to survive than in normal years 
almost 500 of yellowstones 2700 bison have been shot in montana 
and 250 additional permits have been issued and more than 2350 elk 
from yellowstones northern herd of 19000 were shot by montana 
hunters this winter last year only 39 bison were shot in montanas 
hunt 
inside yellowstone rangers have counted more than 300 elk 
carcasses 
this years hunting has been denounced as a slaughter by such 
animalwelfare activists as cleveland amory of new york president 
of the fund for animals 
mott repeated his support for reintroduction of wolves into 
yellowstone not only because wolves could help keep biggame 
populations in balance but because wolves represent the west and 
part of biological diversity 
that proposal is strongly opposed by ranchers outside the park 
mott said yellowstones herds are in no danger of extinction but 
in some areas visitors may see fewer animals this year 
even if winter kill of elk is 50 percent there would still 
be a core that would rapidly reproduce he said 
bison have the biological capacity of recovering from low 
numbers said mary meagher a yellowstone research biologist 
noting that the parks bison started from a remnant population of 22 
animals 
montana officials said they authorized the bison hunt because 
about half of yellowstones bison carry the disease brucellosis 
which causes domestic cows to abort their calves 
but meagher said her best information from montanas state 
veterinarian was that no cases of brucellosis in montana had ever 
been traced to yellowstone animals she also pointed out that 
ranchers vaccinate their calves against the disease

the program is the brainchild of sister nancy bramlage 
coordinator of the university of daytons office of justice peace 
and community outreach 
what we want to do is first of all raise the awareness of 
students that there is the growing problem in the united states with 
the homeless and also give them a little bit of an experience of 
what it must be like even to a tiny extent to be homelesss 
said sister bramlage 
she said the program which is scheduled to begin thursday is 
also designed to encourage students to lobby for more affordable 
housing 
students in the program will be encouraged not to return to their 
houses or residence halls for 24 hours and to sleep on the campus 
plaza next day they will be expected to take their belongings with 
them to classes 
breakfast will consist of coffee and stale bread the lunch soup 
line will offer bread vegetable soup and water 
the alternative to sleeping on the plaza will be attendance at 
hourly prayer vigils in the chapel all night long she said 
sister bramlage said she came up with the idea after students 
showed a strong interest in the hunger issue enrollment at the 
catholic university is 6500 
i think the fact that families are homeless is just a real 
serious problem for society she said if were going to allow 
that whats that going to do to the fabric of society 
william faith director of the ohio coalition for the homeless 
said he thinks the cause is noble but the students need to 
understand that they are sleeping outside out of choice 
its not terribly different than winter camping faith said 
people that are out there on the streets are out there because 
they have no other options and they have no other choice and 
theyre doing it night after night after night 
about 140000 ohioans took part in homelessassistance programs 
last year and in columbus requests for emergency shelters for 
families have quadrupled since 1987 faith said

searching for their national identity in a 
posthirohito era the japanese are embracing values suited to a 
modern economic powerhouse while sometimes mourning the parting with 
the old ways 
in the early years of emperor hirohitos reign which began in 
1926 japan embarked on a militaristic course that led to national 
humiliation and defeat in world war ii 
today japan is rich exerting international influence through 
financial power while its military is limited by a constitution 
that explicitly rejects using international force 
the nations rebirth was the work of wartime survivors who turned 
their energies to building a rich peaceful japan the reign of the 
new emperor akihito is the era of their childrens generation 
hirohito the worlds longest reigning monarch was entombed 
friday 
when older japanese speak of him they think of the shared 
experiences of the war and the long hard climb out of the ruins of 
defeat 
many say they thought of hirohito as a father figure and that he 
embodied the traditional japanese virtues of modesty loyalty to 
family and hard work he attended diligently to his official 
functions and to his avocation as a respected marine biologist 
judging by what the new emperor has so far said in public 
there are strong indications that he has no intention to inherit 
from his father the role as patriarch of the nation wrote kyoto 
university professor takamitsu sawa in saturdays japan times 
as national symbols akihito and empress michiko are seen as 
representative of a more modern international japan the new 
monarch is said to regard the british type of royalty as an ideal 
for his reign sawa said 
hirohitos death gives japan an opportunity to break away from a 
familypatterned society headed by the emperor and embrace values of 
individualism liberalism and democracy he added 
even some older japanese have already broken sharply with the old 
values 
many do feel admiration and sympathy for the imperial family but 
others object to the expense of hirohitos 74 million state funeral 
i think its outrageous the state went to so much trouble for 
one individual said kiyoshi yokoyama 70 
based on their memories of militarism before and during world war 
ii japanese cherish their modern freedoms says takashi inoguchi 
professor of political science at tokyo university 
but some social critics express concern about what they see as a 
lack of oldfashioned virtues of loyalty and diligence among japans 
youth who have known only peace and affluence 
the success of the showa era was not without cost says kyoto 
university professor masataka kosaka using the official name of 
hirohitos reign today ethics have diversified and the people 
have become open to different views but they have lost simple 
and solid faith 
todays japanese often show little caring for traditional values 
during fridays funeral when the government urged the public to 
reflect quietly on hirohitos passing tens of thousands took 
advantage of the national holiday to flee tokyo for the ski slopes 
im sure he was an impressive person but for us it doesnt 
really matter said tomomi tominaga 24 who spent most of friday 
in the mountains skiing 
for young japanese the beginning of the new era prompts other 
reflection 
older people probably feel differently but for us its really 
the beginning of a new era our era said naomi kishi 30 
while the debate continues over hirohitos historical role 
japans new emperor has directed his nations attention to japans 
future pledging to promote peace in his limited role as a national 
symbol 
your image will live in peoples memory for a long time 
said akihito addressing his fathers spirit at the funeral 
but we are now separated in two different worlds you are now 
in the world of our ancestors and i remain in the world of the 
living

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said sunday he 
wants strong ties with moscow to help fight the devilish west 
and iranian legislators reportedly agreed to consider breaking ties 
with britain 
khomeinis overtures to the soviet union which he previously 
condemned for its atheist ideology came during a 1hour meeting 
with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
sheverdnadze later met prime minister hussein musavi and 
delivered an invitation for him to visit moscow according to irans 
official islamic republic news agency 
irna said shevardnadze did not ask khomeini to withdraw his order 
for moslem zealots to assassinate british author salman rushdie 
because of his book the satanic verses britain reportedly asked 
shevardnadze to press khomeini to give a reprieve to rushdie whose 
book has been denounced as insulting to islam 
there was no mention of the affair in shevardnadzes speech 
said irna monitored in nicosia 
the meeting with shevardnadze came two days after khomeini 
declared iran does not need relations with the west this issue has 
divided the tehran hierarchy between socalled pragmatists who 
favor more relations with the rest of the world and hardliners who 
favor continued isolation 
however irans cabinet declared sunday it is united behind 
khomeini reported tehran television which also was monitored in 
nicosia 
your children are united as a single hand against the enemies 
of islam it quoted a cabinet statement as saying of the 
international furor over rushdie 
the awardwinning author born into a moslem family in india has 
been in hiding since khomeinis feb 14 execution order and iranian 
religious leaders put a 52 million bounty on his head 
in protest britain withdrew all its diplomats from its embassy 
in tehran which had been reopened in december after an earlier rift 
of more than a year it also asked iranian diplomats to leave london 
the 11 other european community countries as well as norway 
sweden and canada recalled their top diplomats from iran and 
tehran brought its ambassadors home 
no diplomatic ties have been formally broken but religious 
leaders in tehran last week called for a break with britain 
irna said more than 100 of the 270 deputies in irans parliament 
sponsored a bill sunday to put relations with britain to the vote 
the bill was passed overwhelmingly making it a priority at the 
next parliamentary session tuesday irna said 
rushdie has apologized for the distress the satanic verses 
has caused saying his work was intended to study good and evil from 
a secular viewpoint and not intended to insult anyone 
many moslems contend the novel insults islam by portraying the 
prophet mohammeds wives as prostitutes and suggesting mohammed 
wrote the koran islams holy book rather than receiving it 
directly from god 
the englishlanguage tehran times said sunday that hostile 
relations with the west stemming from the rushdie novel opened all 
doors to improving ties with moscow 
it said the two main irritants to better relations with moscow 
the soviet supply of arms to irans enemy in the 8year iraniaq 
war and the soviet military presence in afghanistan were removed 
at a time when the west has pushed its relations with iran to an 
all time low 
khomeini stressed to shevardnadze the importance of the 
expansion of strong ties in various dimensions in confronting the 
devilish acts of the west tehran radio reported it broadcast 
extensive excerpts from the meeting at khomeinis home which irna 
said was believed to be the first private meeting between irans 
88yearold revolutionary patriarch and a foreign minister 
tehran television showed khomeini wearing a skullcap and robes 
with a blanket over his knees talking to shevardnadze 
the soviet leader later met musavi and the two agreed to set up 
mechanisms for regulating political contacts between moscow and 
tehran tehran radio said 
shervardnadze said nikolai konarev chairman of the iransoviet 
joint economic commission will visit iran shortly with 
significant proposals irna reported 
we hope significant chances will take place in bilateral 
cooperation in the political and economic fields as a result of the 
current atmosphere he told musavi 
shevardnadze was scheduled to return to moscow on monday his 
middle east trip was 10 days

here is a transcript of former sen john 
towers appearance sunday on the abctv show this week with david 
brinkley he was questioned by sam donaldson george will and 
cokie roberts 
donaldson senator tower welcome to our program this morning 
tower thank you sam im delighted to be back its sort of 
refreshing to be able to break my silence after three months 
donaldson we appreciate your coming in here to do it you heard 
senator nunn this morning suggest that if the white house continues 
to leak as he sees it 
tower mmmhmm 
donaldson portions of that fbi report the committee ought 
to resume its hearings and call people put them under subpoena and 
oath and take their testimony would you agree to that 
tower im not going to try to advise the committee on what to 
do and the committee will arrive at its own decision on that i am 
no longer a member of the committee and i have found that im not 
dont have a great deal of influence over what the committee 
does but i am hopeful that we can reduce the level of the rhetoric 
somewhat 
donaldson yes but would that be a fair 
tower deescalate it 
donaldson would that be a fair thing to do 
tower well i think that in fairness to the white house they 
are reacting to about three months of solid allegations being poured 
into the public media and therefore the white house i think felt 
it necessary to refer to the more favorable aspects of the report in 
an effort to shoot down these allegations as you know in this 
business the answer rarely catches up with the charge you can be 
charged with something on a threecolumn headline above the fold in 
the paper and the next day the rebuttal for it or the disproof of 
it is back on the 23rd page somewhere and i think that thats what 
the white house was responding to the white house was put on the 
defensive by all of the allegations that came through across the 
media and i think that should be understood 
donaldson well senator 
tower i know one thing and that is that the committee didnt 
tell me nor did the white house tell me theyre very meticulous 
about this what the allegations were and i learned about them 
by seeing them on television and reading them in the newspaper and 
that was my first hint 
donaldson well senator 
tower that these allegations were out there 
donaldson as you know many of the allegations have to do 
with to put it rather inelegantly the charge that youre a common 
or uncommon drunk that 
tower mmmhmm 
donaldson you admitted that in the 70s you had a drinking 
problem but the allegations are that it has persisted now what 
can you tell us to reassure on that point 
tower i would deny that allegation and what i would like to do 
in response to that is to read a portion of letter that was issued 
by a doctor who took care of me after i was operated on for a colon 
polyp in which a very thorough examination was made and i will not 
read the entire letter although the entire letter i think is very 
revealing 
donaldson it will be made part of the record

milton wright entered a living 
nightmare when the american steel foundries plant where he worked 
for 19 years closed in 1982 
but wright 51 learned last week that asf plans to resume 
production at its foundry once the nations largest producer of 
railroad undercarriages and hes eligible for recall 
i cant think of anything else that would make me happier than 
to see this plant open up wright said i have tears in my eyes 
right now 
the foundrys revival is a godsend for the more than 200 workers 
who will be rehired an estimated 650 employees were laid off when 
the plant closed 
though he eventually managed to find another job wright 
remembers the closure all too well bills mounted while he struggled 
to find work and unemployment put a strain on his marriage which 
ended in divorce about three years ago he also sought professional 
help to calm his nerves 
when we shut down most of us said were going to get two 
three months rest wright recalled six months later when your 
unemployment runs out you say hey whats going to happen to me 
then a year later its a nightmare 
at its peak in 1979 when us manufacturers produced about 
94000 railroad cars the foundry employed about 1700 people 
according to asf president norman a berg 
several factors led to the railroad parts industrys collapse 
just three years later including deregulation of the railroads 
they could operate more efficiently and really they didnt 
need many cars berg said 
also companies that invested heavily in railroad cars during the 
late 1970s in order to lease them to the railroads pulled out when 
the economy soured 
as a result the industry in the early 1980s faced a surplus of 
almost 300000 railroad cars said elwyn ahnquist president of the 
chicagobased american railway car institute in 1982 fewer than 
19000 railroad cars were produced nationwide 
but now ahnquist and berg say the railroad parts industry is 
gaining steam because of a decline in the surplus of railroad cars 
to about 40000 and many of the 12 million cars in use are 
obsolete or nearly so 
and in may berg said the foundry here will resume producing 
cast steel side frames and bolsters which form the undercarriages 
or trucks of railroad cars 
thirtyfive employees are getting the plant ready for reopening 
and in the next couple of weeks 30 more will be added plant manager 
william donovan said by early summer the company expects to recall 
200 more workers at roughly 10 an hour he said 
wright says hes happier for his former coworkers who never 
landed a job after the plant closed it took him two years but he 
finally found work as a supervisor at another steelrelated plant in 
granite city 
and if the money is right he makes between 30000 and 40000 
annually now he said hed love to go back to american steel 
calling it the best company to work for 
whether i go back or not i am concerned about my coworkers 
wright said hopefully theyll be able to go to work at american 
steel and say hey once again im a working man i have my pride 
back

independent nation 
indias lt gen dewan premchand arrived in windheok the 
namibian capital a week ahead of the first troops he will command 
as head of the military component of the united nations transition 
assistance group untag 
the only exception to the warm welcome were complaints by some 
supporters of the guerrilla southwest african peoples organization 
that the united nations decided to send only 4650 troops to 
namibia rather than the 7500 sought by the guerrilla organization 
and other african countries 
they are to keep peace when the independence process begins april

win independence elections planned in early november is the 
southwest african peoples organization the guerrilla movement 
that has waged a 22year bush war against pretorias troops 
pretoria agreed to implement the un independence plan in 
december 
the plan originally called for 4650 peacekeeping troops in 
namibia but the un security council decided on the smaller number 
in a bid to keep down costs estimated at more than 400 million 
at a brief news conference premchand said he thinks he has 
sufficient troops to perform his mission in the territory which is 
about twice the size of california but is one of the worlds most 
sparsely populated lands with only 13 million people 
gen willie meyer head of the south africanled military in 
namibia met premchand and his 12 senior assistants at windhoek 
airport 
premchand said he plans to travel extensively and meet other key 
figures in the territory in coming days 
twentythree countries have agreed to provide troops military 
observers and civilians for the namibia operation 
the election campaign is to begin in july 
swapos chief rival is expected to be the democratic turnhalle 
alliance a multiracial coalition backed by the south african 
government that favors free enterprise and a multiparty democracy 
four other political parties announced saturday they have merged 
to become the united democratic front of namibia their decision not 
to join swapo which has a similar poltical platform was seen as a 
setback for the guerrilla movement 
swapo has yet to detail its plans however the organization says 
it favors a socialist economy and has not stated whether it would 
allow the existence of other political parties

world leaders wrapped up their visits on sunday and 
asked japan to take a bigger role in middle east peace efforts and 
spread more of its great wealth to developing nations 
the funeral of emperor hirohito which drew representatives of 
163 nations provided an unusual chance for leaders to meet in tokyo 
without some of the constraints of diplomatic protocol 
president bush met with 20 world leaders before leaving saturday 
for china and then south korea japanese prime minister noboru 
takeshita met with nearly 40 and foreign minister sousuke uno held

on sunday un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar asked 
for japan to play a larger role in unsponsored peace talks 
between iran and iraq news reports said

iran over the controversial book the satanic verses kyodo news

in a meeting sunday with iranian vice president mostafa mir 
salim japanese foreign minister sousuke uno said he hoped iran 
would rescind its intolerable death threat against author salman 
rushdie a ministry official said 
but uno said japan had no plan to follow european nations lead 
and withdraw its ambassador from iran in protest over the death 
threat 
we have chosen the course of expressing our opinions to iran 
and maintaining relations the official said

muhi dim maruf to help iraq rebuild after a peace settlement is 
achieved with iran kyodo reported 
in talks with israeli president chaim herzog takeshita said

ties with cambodia vietnam laos and burma kyodo said 
although many japanese expressed pride over the record number of 
countries attending hirohitos funeral some said part of the reason

conductor herbert von karajan and the vienna 
philharmonic took a familiar piece of music schuberts unfinished 
symphony and not only made it fresh but made it sound like a 
miracle of composition 
most of the audience at carnegie hall for the first of two 
concerts by the vienna conducted by karajan had heard the 
unfinished numerous times saturday nights audience heard it as 
though experiencing it for the first time 
the vienna can playas softly as a murmur but there are aspects 
to this magnificent orchestras playing that one forgets sound can 
swell in certain groups of instruments without getting generally 
loud lowtoned instruments can convey depths of feeling the 
playing and not only the famous silken violins is so smooth that 
a listeners breathing is calmed 
karajan brought up sections of instruments whose sound wasnt 
emotionally whipped up but seemed to be filled with emotion 
but the most aweinspiring aspect was the playing of schuberts 
melodic themes each began like a tiny shoot through the surrounding 
ground of the orchestral playing and grew straight getting bigger 
to bud then bloom the themes werent overblown or overpowering but 
we never heard them so majestic 
karajan who is 80 has been music director of the berlin 
philharmonic since 1955 he has long conducted the vienna 
philharmonic both at the salzburg festival and in vienna this is 
the first time he has conducted it here in 30 years the orchestra 
currently has no resident conductor 
some expected karajan to enter the stage in a wheelchair but he 
walked holding the arm of a musician the back of the podium was 
made with a kind of bench against which karajan leaned while he 
conducted he walked off the stage and then walked back to the 
podium to take bows he received standing ovations at every entrance 
and exit 
the second half of the program was short pieces by johann and 
josef strauss which the vienna philharmonic annually plays on a 
televised new years concert these can be breezy confections but 
the vienna philharmonic and karajan gave them more substance than 
that 
the overture to the gypsy baron was trippingly joyful and one 
could see the spirit of a young man in the maestros gestures 
music of the spheres had majestic yearning an uplighting 
section and flowing sweetness annenpolka floated delicately 
its second time through 
the less familiar hilarion waltz began with a storm brewing 
became expansive with pretty melodies and continued through several 
elaborate sections perpetuum mobile which is dizzyingly fast 
ended by fading away and karajan giving a theatrical what could i 
do shrug 
the emperor waltz evokes the ringing sound of success and an 
opulent way of life

communist party leader karoly grosz said 
sunday the introduction of a multiparty system will leave less 
room for bad decisions but wont solve all of hungarys problems 
the introduction of a multiparty system in hungary is a 
novelty but not a historic event grosz was quoted as saying by 
the state news agency tanjug monitored in vienna even a 
multiparty system is not a guarantee that grave social mistakes 
will not be repeated 
pluralism grosz said is likely to bring about less room for 
bad decisions because the parties will be publicly controlling one 
another 
grosz was interviewed in budapest by tanjugs director general 
mihailo saranovic prior to a brief visit to yugoslavia monday for 
talks with his yugoslav counterpart stipe suvar on reform in the 
east bloc and bilateral relations 
hungarys ruling communist party endorsed a multiparty system for 
the first time earlier this month but stressed the transition to 
more pluralism should be gradual and orderly 
in a separate development the state news agency mti reported 
that hungary will drop the traditional may day parade this year 
after 44 years of observation 
in a report late saturday the agency did not spell out the 
reasons for which the workers demonstration an annual fixture in 
the soviet bloc was abolished 
participants at a weekend meeting laying the groundwork for an 
independent trade union of young workers said they believed among 
the reasons the may 1 parade was dropped was that authorities were 
fearful of posters calling for better living conditions for 
hungarian workers or voicing other complaints 
even if they say no we shall sponsor our own parade said a 
participant 
in place of the parade authorities plan to stage a rally at 
which grosz will make a speech mti said 
the announcement appeared to indicate that may day would still 
remain a holiday in hungary 
the communist partys policysetting central committee in a 
statement released after a highly secretive twoday meeting feb 
1011 said it had decided a multiparty system would provide a 
better safeguard against abuse of power than the singleparty 
rule initiatied with the communist takeover in 1948 
if hungary implements genuine powersharing it would be the 
first east bloc country to have a bona fide multiparty system 
the hungarian parliament which is increasingly outspoken is to 
pass a bill legalizing alternative political parties by aug 1 1989 
grosz however told tanjug that the communist party does not 
plan to relinquish its leading role in hungary 
dozens of independent groups have formed in hungary over the past 
year several of which are likely to become political parties the 
smallholders and the social democratic parties have announced their 
return after 40 years both were essentially dissolved when the 
communists came to power in 1948

a community effort to raise 90000 to pay 
police officers a raise fell short of its goal and nearly half the 
citys force was laid off sunday 
mayor louis washowich said donations may allow officials to call 
back a few of the 21 idled officers as early as friday but only for 
a limited time 
washowich said the layoffs were necessary because state 
arbitrators recently awarded the police department wage increases of 
4 percent to 4 percent which the allegheny county city could not 
afford 
city officials have said officers made an average of about 
28000 a year before the raise while the police bargaining unit 
has said the average was closer to 25000 
the mayor said fundraising is not a longterm solution 
i dont want to create false hopes for people he said 
washowich has said laying off 21 officers from the force of about 
50 for three months would save the city 90000 but wage increases 
and benefits for the police will cost between 110000 and 120000 
this year and an additional 225000 next year he said 
mckeesports volunteer ambulance company began the fundraising 
effort thursday with a 15000 donation a restaurant planned to 
contribute proceeds from sundays sales which could raise 5000 to 
7000 according to manager fred balistreri 
equibank officials said saturday that the company would match 
money raised during the coming week up to 50000 equibank 
employees plan to canvass mckeesport for donations wednesday 
officer patrick carloss head of the police departments wage and 
policy committee said the ambulance companys 15000 alone would 
be enough to keep officers working for another two weeks 
carloss said he was surprised and angered by the mayors decision 
to proceed with layoffs as planned carloss was among those affected 
its a total slap in the face of the citizens of mckeesport 
carloss said these people are going out of their way to save the 
police 
he said the mayor wanted to punish the police for going to 
arbitration washowich said he based his decision solely on the need 
to balance the citys budget

an opposition group called on workers to 
strike and said sunday that the talks between the solidarity labor 
movement and the government will prolong totalitarian rule 
solidarity leader lech walesa meanwhile told a rally in gdansk 
that workers must refrain from strikes while the talks on political 
and economic reforms continue 
but the meeting by renegade activists in the southern city of 
jastrzebie criticized walesas moderate stand up to 120 people were 
arrested and held briefly friday and saturday to prevent them from 
attending the weekend meeting said opposition figure jozef pinior 
pinior a leader of the banned polish socialist party said the 
meeting resulted in a resolution calling for free elections and the 
removal of the monopolistic authority of the communist party 
the resolution said workers should use strikes to achieve their 
political goals and criticized stands taken at the talks 
the roundtable talks will have our support only when they are 
not used to prevent workers protests said the resolution quoted 
by pinior 
the model of an antiworker economic reform accepted by the 
negotiators at the roundtable is unacceptable and only serves to 
make more credible and to prolong totalitarian rule it said 
pinior said the congress was attended by members of his group 
the banned peace group freedom and peace the militant splinter 
group fighting solidarity and the independent students association 
meanwhile in the baltic port city of gdansk walesa said the 
talks need at least three more weeks of labor calm 
he who wants to make trouble should go away from here 
immediately i am asking on my knees that you not destroy our 
country he said addressing about 2000 people after a mass at 
st brygidas church 
there are reasons for strikes everywhere he said but now 
we have to mobilize ourselves and refrain 
but walesa made clear that continued labor peace was contingent 
upon further government liberalizations 
if there are no reforms by april or may i lech walesa will 
call for struggle he said 
after walesa spoke about 200 young people staged a noisy march 
in gdansk chanting solidarity 
the government and a broad spectrum of opposition groups have 
been meeting since feb 6 to negotiate sweeping economic political 
and social change in poland the government says it will consider 
legalizing solidarity if it agrees to be a party to reforms 
solidarity was the first independent labor union in the soviet 
bloc when it was founded in 1980 it was outlawed after the 
imposition of martial law in 1981

sir roy denman european community representative in washington 
assured the governors they had nothing to fear from moves toward 
greater unity among the 12 common market nations 
he said one american concern was that there will be a fortress 
europe and the answer is thats rubbish 
for european nations to impose trade barriers on the united 
states would be shooting ourslves in both feet and the rear 
us trade representative carla hills warned the governors 
against minimizing the importance of the dispute between the united 
states and the european community over us beef treated with 
hormones 
the europeans banned imports of us beef the united states 
argued that the europeans acted without examining scientific 
evidence that the beef was safe for human consumption 
she said the amount of trade was only 100 million and as a 
result some commentators considered the dispute of little importance 
trust me its not she said warning that if beef is the 
target on this occasion what happens next month when a trading 
partner does not want to buy our corn because it has been sprayed 
with a certain pesticide 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis told mrs hills that many 
companies in his state complain to him about the difficulty getting 
export licenses from the federal government particularly high tech 
companies 
it is frustrating for those who apply she said yet the 
national interest is such that they must apply we cannot give away 
our technology

military ruler augusto pinochet 
repudiated by voters in a referendum last year is being wooed by 
the right to run for president again officials said 
many think the diversity of candidates is making it quite 
difficult to reach a candidate of consensus and the one who may be 
closest is president pinochet defense minister patricio carvajal 
said in a recent interview 
when the military government offered pinochet as the only 
candidate in a referendum in october chileans rejected the bid of 
the 73yearold army commander to extend his authoritarian rule 
until 1997 
the terms of the constitution drafted under the military 
government now call for an open presidential election on dec 14 
the constitution holds that the president cannot seek reelection 
to a consecutive term reform of the constitution is seen as the 
only means of allowing pinochet to be nominated as the official 
candidate 
pinochet backers however say the constitutional restriction 
does not apply to the general since he was not elected in the first 
place 
pinochet seized power in a 1973 military coup that toppled the 
elected government of marxist president salvador allende who died 
in the overthrow 
patricio aylwin 70 president of the centrist christian 
demoratic party and the man who led the opposition coalition 
campaign against pinochet in october is considered the frontrunner 
in a field of at least four contenders for the opposition 
presidential nomination 
the opposition said it will support a single candidate in the 
december election and the nomination is expected to be made next 
month 
pinochet announced only recently he would not be a candidate he 
made clear he intends to direct the progovernment campaign and even 
pick the candidate to succeed him 
soon i will tell you whom we shall support lets not rush 
things the general told supporters in a recent trip thorugh the 
country 
yet many supporters are still urging him to run 
the two largest parties on the right national renovation and the 
independent democratic union joined in backing pinochet in the 
october referendum but disputes have since distanced the two 
divisions also have surfaced among smaller progovernment parties 
over centenders for the official candidacy including two who have 
already launched their bids extremeright lawyer pablo rodriguez 
and sergio diez former ambassador to the united nations in the 
pinochet government 
others on the right are looking to pinochets 39yearold finance 
minister hernan buchi 
alejandro navarrete mayor of chiles secondlargest city the 
neighboring port city of valparaiso said the number of potential 
candidates is causing pinochets political figure to loom large 
observers say the disunity on the right is also being fueled by 
disagreements over calls for political and constitutional reform 
for instance some in the opposition are demanding that the next 
presidential term to begin in march 1990 run four years and not 
the eight dictated by the constitution 
while some forces on the right support a shortened term others 
call it an opposition attempt to ruin the presidency 
the opposition also is seeking changes to the constitution which 
now guarantees pinochet extraordinary powers even after leaving 
office 
under the existing constitution an expresident pinochet would 
be made a senator for life he and the other armed forces chiefs as 
well as the national police director would continue to lead their 
respective institutions for eight years

united airlines has begun a series of special 
maintenance checks on its aircraft following the accident near 
hawaii in which nine people died the airline said sunday 
the maintenance checks are over and above uniteds existing 
procedures and those required by the federal aviation 
administration said united chairman stephen m wolf 
by announcing these steps we want to make clear that we are 
not speculating and will not speculate on the cause of fridays 
incident wolf said in a company statement by the same token 
we have an absolute commitment to safety and we intend to go well 
beyond our alreadystrict standards and faa requirements 
a cargo door may have popped open on united flight 811 ripping a 
hole in the side of the 18yearold boeing 747 which was flying at 
22000 feet about 100 miles south of honolulu federal investigators 
have said nine of the 354 people on board were blown out and are 
presumed dead the plane returned safely to honolulu 
wolf also said the 747 involved in fridays accident on flight 
811 was in compliance with all faa airworthiness directives and 
maintenance requirements 
however the jets cargo door locks had not yet been modified 
under a july order by the federal aviation adminstration that 
airlines improve cargo door lock systems on older boeing 747s after 
a door in one plane partly opened in flight the deadline for that 
work is the end of this year 
united had inspected all 25 of its jets covered by the order but 
had completed the required modifications on just six by last week 
spokesman russell mack said in chicago the plane in fridays 
accident was not one of the six he said 
because the right forward cargo door was suspected in the 
incident wolf said united checked all cargo doors on its fleet of 
31 747s and all were found to be in proper working order 
in addition a detailed technical inspection emcompassing all 
latches seals fittings and other parts of the door mechanisms 
was expected to be completed sunday similar inspections were to be 
done on all aircraft in uniteds fleet the statement said 
it also said an faalicensed mechanic will inspect each 747 cargo 
door upon arrival at a destination in addition to regular 
predeparture inspections and such mechanics will oversee the 
closing of each 747 cargo door before departures the closings have 
been handled by trained ramp service personnel the statement

taba israeliheld sinai ap israel and egypt signed a 
historic agreement sunday that will turn this desert beach strip 
over to egypt and end a sevenyear border dispute that has marred 
relations 
the agreement calling for israelis to withdraw from the 250acre 
resort by march 15 was signed at the sonesta hotel in taba northern 
sinai 
both sides joined us mediators in expressing hope that future 
disputes between israel and its arab neighbors can be solved through 
negotiations 
a new chapter is starting and we sincerely hope it will lead to 
the road of a comprehensive peace said egypts chief negotiator 
nabil elaraby 
his israeli counterpart foreign ministry directorgeneral reuven 
merhav added it is a splended example and a shining beacon of 
hope we in israel believe negotiations are the only possible path 
to peace 
a key point of the accord will allow israelis to visit the resort 
for up to 14 days without visas or special entry fees israel also 
will continue supplying water and electricity to the area 
the agreement was approved sunday by israels 10member inner 
cabinet by a 81 vote with one abstention 
prime minister yitzhak shamir who voted for the agreement said 
he nevertheless regretted the results 
to my great sorrow the drama has ended as it has ended 
shamir said at a sunday night rally of his rightwing likud bloc in 
northern israel 
my stand was well known i opposed the turn to arbitration and 
instead wanted to turn to compromise he said if we had agreed 
to compromise we would not have had to leave taba he said 
shamir and the likud opposed the agreement in 1986 to enter 
binding arbitration they preferred nonbinding negotiations 
international arbitrators on sept 29 delineated the border in 
such a way as to put the beach in egypt israel delayed 
implementation of the ruling pending negotiations over obtaining 
easy access for tourists and receiving compensation for the hotel 
and a neighboring holiday village 
under the agreement egypt will purchase the sonesta for 37 
million and the holiday village for 15 million 
egypts tourism minister fuad sultan said israeli tourists will 
be extremely welcome 
the dispute over taba which borders on the southern israeli port 
of eilat began in april 1982 when israel refused to withdraw from 
the strip as it ended a 15year occupation of the bulk of the sinai 
desert

jesse jackson mayor eugene sawyers most vocal 
supporter urges voters to maintain the gains that blacks have 
brought to city hall but others are predicting that chicago could 
become the first major city to have a black mayor defeated by a 
white 
several variables could alter the result but the most likely 
scenario according to pundits and polls has richard m daley 
who is white and the son of late mayor richard j daley winning 
tuesdays democratic primary and the april 4 election 
blacks fear that losing power in city hall would erase gains 
achieved by harold washington the citys first black mayor who 
died a few months into his second term in 1987 
of course that fear helps motivate people to get out the 
vote said robert starks professor of political science at 
chicagos northeastern illinois university starks is chairman of a 
task force on black political power which he said helped elect 
washington in 1983 
not only would it be the first loss of a black mayor it would 
also be a loss of the completion of harold washingtons last two 
years in office starks said it would be a tragic loss 
even if sawyer managed to win tuesday and a newspaper poll a 
week ago had him gaining on daley but still 8 percentage points 
behind it would not guarantee that a black would stay in city hall 
the gop candidate in april will be white and could be former 
washington nemesis edward vrdolyak who is running a writein 
campaign for the republican nomination that candidate would face 
sawyer and thirdparty candidate timothy evans a black alderman a 
split in the black vote could put a white in office 
after washington died sawyer was elected his successor in a 
raucous city council meeting by a coalition made up mostly of white 
aldermen who opposed washington 
but jackson told an operation push meeting saturday that sawyer 
has maintained the gains brought by washington and he has urged 
the divided black electorate to unite behind sawyer in the primary 
but he also stressed that race is not the only factor in the 
election saying the issue fundamentally is about forwards and 
backwards its about being progressive or regressive so i think 
that to center the analysis on race misses much of the point 
the era of bigcity black mayors in the united states began in 
1967 when carl stokes was elected in cleveland and richard hatcher 
in gary ind said thomas e cavanagh director of johns hopkins 
universitys center for the study of american government in 
washington 
los angeles atlanta detroit and philadelphia have followed 
suit he said and a black incumbent in a big city has yet to lose 
to a white cleveland now has a white mayor but that happened after 
stokes decided not to seek reelection cavanagh said in a telephone 
interview sunday 
in chicago political turmoil sparked by washingtons death will 
be to blame if a black cant hold city hall cavanagh said 
exploiting divisions within the minority community is one way 
that the traditional white leadership can regain power he said 
cities such as chicago where fewer than 50 percent of voters are 
black are especially vulnerable he said 
cavanagh said its only to be expected that youre going to 
have reversals from time to time 
but to starks such a loss in chicago would create a call to go 
back to work 
there will be a doubling of organizing efforts to come back 
stronger than ever in 1991 he said

venezuela this week will suspend 
capital and interest payments on its privatesector debt a banking 
official was quoted as saying sunday 
venezuelan central bank president pedro tinoco was quoted by the 
newspaper el nacional as saying it will stop making the payments on 
wednesday 
afterwards he said the south american nations privatesector 
debt will be renegotiated as a block together with venezuelas 
public sectors refinanced debt of 203 billion 
in january pressed by declining oil export revenue and shrinking 
international monetary reserves venezuela suspended principal 
payments over its public sectors debt 
officials of the new social democratic government that took power 
in early february have held preliminary contacts with creditor banks 
to reschedule the countrys refinanced debt over a period of 2025 
years up from current 14 years fixed interest rates and a grace 
period of six to eight years 
venezuela owes a total of 33 billion abroad and ranks fourth 
among latin american debtors after brazil mexico and argentina 
the private sectors debt had been regularly served so far and 
the decision afects 472 million in principal due this year 
under current agreements venezuela was to pay private sector 
obligations over the next three years tinoco said it is not 
convenient to the nation to repay it in three years we will place 
it as part of the ongoing renegotiation process with foreign 
creditors he said 
in total venezuela paid last year more than 5 billion to its 
creditors 
there were no immediate comments on the decision from the private 
sector or from banks but when it was unofficially disclosed on 
thursday some said such a move was expected given the new 
governments hardening stand on foreign debt problems 
tinoco said part of the venezuelan strategy with its creditors 
points at reducing the nations total debt by buying part of it at 
the secondary markets there it is rated at less than a half its 
face value 
we are studying a series of concrete and realistic 
possibilities he said without elaborating 
the official announcement over the private sector debt came as 
the nation is negotiating an agreement with the international 
monetary fund that will allow venezuela financial support from the 
multilateral institution and fresh loans from creditor banks

a roman catholic archbishop has been given a 
helicopter but his plan to use it to travel in the 
8300squaremile archdiocese of los angeles has brought out safety 
concerns and criticism of the expense 
archbishop roger m mahony who earned a helicopter pilots 
license last summer wants to use the 395000 hughes 389d for 
visits in his archdiocese which sprawls over los angeles ventura 
and santa barbara counties 
the 7yearold helicopter was donated by a group organized by los 
angeles lawyer richard j riordan a close friend of the archbishop 
the gift includes maintenance operating costs and insurance 
several catholic high schools and two seminaries have been 
directed to prepare landing pads and landing rights are being 
sought downtown mahony whose 53rd birthday is monday lives 
downtown at st vibianas cathedral 
the gift has been criticized by advocates for the poor 
the problems and needs of the homeless and the refugee and 
immigrant populations far exceed what is being done by the 
diocese said catherine morris a spokeswoman for the catholic 
worker organization if he is going to set a good example hed 
say thank you very much and give it back 
the gift also has generated concern among some aviation experts 
because of the skill needed to fly a helicopter and the complexity 
of southern california airspace 
insurance restrictions prevent mahony from flying alone so an 
instructor will fly with him but some pilots said a novice at the 
controls of a helicopter might not be a good idea in los angeles 
crowded skies 
he could be asking for a lot of trouble said capt james 
kelly a navy chaplain who is licensed to fly a helicopter and also 
holds a commercial pilots license and instructor certificate 
flying a helicopter is no easy task he has a lot to offer the 
church and it might be better for him to just get a driver and sit 
and do his work in the back of the car 
mahony would not comment a news conference about the helicopter 
was scheduled for tuesday said david moore executive director of 
communications for the archdiocese 
elsewhere in the united states the dioceses of anchorage and 
fairbanks alaska and gallup nm own airplanes used by bishops 
and priests to cover expansive rugged terrain

a sovietborn israeli who allegedly gave 
military secrets to the palestine liberation organization and asked 
for 15 million in return was indicted sunday before a tel aviv 
court israel radio reported 
the indictment accused binyamin shenkman 35 of giving plo 
officials in athens secret information on the israeli army during 
three trips to greece in 1988 the radio said 
he also offered to fly to plo headquarters in tunis and hold a 
press conference where he would answer questions on israels 
military capabilities and publically tear up his israeli passport 
it said 
shenkman demanded 15 million from the plo in return for his 
actions the radio said but he was never paid and police arrested 
him at the airport when he returned from athens 
the radio said shenkman moved to israel from the soviet union in 
1978 and served in the army for four months in 1985 
details of the information disclosed by shenkman and his role in 
the military have been banned from publication 
it is unusual however for a new immigrant who has served only a 
short time in the military to be given a position in which he works 
with sensitive information 
the radio had previously quoted shenkman whose name was first 
released sunday as saying his actions were motivated in part by his 
disillusionment with israel after immigrating 
i ask that you take into consideration that all my life i only 
wanted to come to israel and here i suffered the radio quoted 
shenkman as telling the court after he his arrest 
there were people who embittered my life every day and each 
hour he said the radio did not elaborate 
the court has not yet set a date for shenkmans trial 
a 1986 law bans unauthorized meetings with members of a terrorist 
group israel views the plo as a such a group 
charges of espionage carry a maximun 30year prison sentence 
shenkmans is the second case of alleged espionage involving a 
soviet emigre on dec 15 shabtai kalmanovich 45 was sentenced to 
nine years in prison on charges of spying for the soviet union and 
having contacts with a foreign agent

it was an extraordinary live tv exchange a 
prominent former senator taking on direct allegations that he was a 
common drunk and womanizer 
especially so for a sunday morning talk show 
by the time it was over john tower had acknowledged a fondness 
for scotch whisky 12 years ago but said he was never an alcoholic 
has imbibed only modestly in recent years and promised not to take a 
single drink if he wins confirmation as secretary of defense 
he challenged his interrogators to define womanizer 
one of them a woman countered only that women know one when 
they see one 
at any rate tower declined to extend his teetotal pledge to 
women 
i am a single man he protested when asked to say whether he 
would do so 
all this from one of the presidents closest advisers a man 
formerly referred to in us senate jargon as my distinguished 
colleague a former armscontrol negotiator and appointee to 
presidential commissions 
the exchange sunday on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
marked towers debut in his uphill fight to win full senate 
confirmation as president bushs defense secretary 
he later made the same presentation on cable news network 
tower said at the start of the abc program that he was happy to 
be able to break my silence on the character allegations that 
have swirled around him since his nomination the senate armed 
services committee which he once chaired as a senator from texas 
recommended against his confirmation on thursday 
sundays television interview by abcs sam donaldson george will 
and cokie roberts quickly bore into the nittygritty details of his 
personal life 
tower did not shrink from it 
donaldson asked him about to put it rather inelegantly the 
charge that youre a common or uncommon drunk 
in response tower read a doctors letter testifying that his 
liver shows no evidence at all of alcoholic impairment or 
alcoholism and that there appeared no alcoholrelated impairment 
to his being defense secretary 
he went on to make a formal pledge he said he hopes will remove 
the main obstacle to his confirmation 
let me state that i have never been an alcoholic nor dependent 
on alcohol however to allay any fears or doubts on this matter i 
hereby swear and undertake that if confirmed during the course of 
my tenure as secretary of defense i will not consume beverage 
alcohol of any type or form including wine beer or spirits of any 
kind 
will told him it is fairly well on the record that at one 
point in the 70s you drank more than even you think you should 
have 
tower oh yes i did 
will was there a point prior to this pledge at which you 
could point to and say there i changed 
tower yes twelve years i gave up spirits i used to be a 
pretty good scotch drinker and i gave up i havent tasted scotch 
in 12 years 
after that i had only wine had perhaps an occasional martini 
occasionally a little vodka with smoked salmon or caviar or 
something like that but that was just occasionally i really 
essentially have been a wine drinker and now my only consumption 
is wine at meals i dont drink wine even unless im eating 
talk later returned to the pledge when donaldson said by 
making that pledge today it seems to me youre admitting you have a 
drinking problem 
tower i anticipated that question sam because in vetting 
this with some of my friends they said thats the spin that would 
be put on it i said in the statement that i am not an alcoholic 
nor have i ever been dependent on alcohol 
donaldson then why would you make a pledge when you say 
theres no reason to 
tower well why not make it its a small thing to do to allay 
doubts and fears 
donaldson if you say theres no reason to do it now when 
allegations are raised that youre a womanizer should you take a 
pledge not to go out with women 
tower im a single man i do date women ive been a 
single man for 3 years 
donaldson persisted 
what is your definition of womanizing sam tower asked at 
one point womanize is a broad term what is your definition of 
the term 
donaldson i dont know 
tower well all right cokie do you have a definition of 
the term 
roberts well i think most women have a know it when they 
see it senator 
tower but you still cant define it 
subsequently encountering a group of reporters off camera tower 
said he could live with the scrutiny that ultimately forced former 
sen gary hart of colorado out of last years presidential race 
asked in light of his alcohol pledge if he would invite reporters 
to follow him as did hart amid rumors he was unfaithful to his wife 
tower replied look a secretary of defense lives in a goldfish 
bowl if anybody wants to put a tail on me they can

the last three british minehunters in the 
persian gulf leave for home monday closing another chapter in the 
western naval commitment to protect shipping lanes during the 
iraniraq war 
britains defense ministry said sunday in london that the hms 
berkeley hms chiddingfold and hms cottesmore would take about three 
weeks to reach their home port of rosyth near edinburgh scotland 
hms herald an ocean survey ship serving as support vessel for 
the mineclearing trio left earlier this month and another 
auxiliary ship hms diligence will depart with the minehunters the 
ministry said 
the withdrawal first announced more than a month ago was 
unrelated to a renewed call by the soviet union during the weekend 
for all foreign warships to leave the persian gulf now that a 
ceasefire between iraq and iran has remained in effect for six 
months 
the minehunters departure leaves the royal navys armilla 
patrol consisting of three frigates and a support ship to 
represent british seapower in the gulf officials say there are no 
plans to withdraw the patrol 
it also leaves the united states virtually alone with the task of 
further mineclearing in the strategic waterway us officers 
estimate there may still be as many as 150 to 200 mines laid by both 
sides in the gulf 
six woodenhulled us minesweepers dispatched to the gulf in 
late 1987 and still on duty are the last foreign ships based in the 
waterway equipped to deal with mines 
the iranian navy claims it has cleared irans coastal waters but 
these do not include the gulfs main shipping lanes where the mine 
threat was greatest 
the mines occasionally break loose from their underwater moorings 
and drift into shipping lanes 
us and british naval officers put little stock in the iranian 
claims because they do not believe the iranian navy is equipped to 
clear mines 
neither iran nor iraq is known to have offered to provide charts 
of its minefields particularly in the northern gulf 
the united states and britain were among seven western countries 
that sent warships to the gulf or reinforced units already there 
in 1987 to protect shipping caught in the escalating tanker war 
a spinoff of the iraniraq conflict the conflict included a spate 
of incidents involving iranianlaid mines 
while foreign navies have been scaling back since iran and iraq 
agreed to a truce aug 20 there were indications that the 
withdrawal of british minehunters amounted to a policy reversal 
william waldegrave britains minister of state for foreign and 
commonwealth affairs told a news conference in saudi arabia oct 23 
that the antimine force was likely to have a continuing role for 
a good many years 
during a visit to iraq saturday soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said moscow was prepared to remove its forces 
his remarks were seen as aimed chiefly at the united states 
which has reduced its force by four warships since the ceasefire 
but still has 23 in the region including 14 in the gulf 
us officials say that while force size is tailored to the 
threat at any given time the united states intends to continue its 
40year naval presence in the persian gulf

mr donaldson were back with former senator john tower 
senator lets go back to your relationship with the defense 
industry now you were a consultant for them for about two years 
weve discussed that a lot of people wonder whether coming back to 
the pentagon and trying to cut the budget and take a hard look at 
overruns and other abuses of defense contracting whether youre the 
right man to do it they say youre in the defense industrys 
pocket 
sen tower well thats an allegation that is untrue i am not 
in the defense industrys pocket let me point out one thing any 
suggestion that i would be inordinately influenced by the industry 
falls on the basis of my past record and performance 
when i was chairman of the presidents special review board the 
socalled tower commission at the time i was asked to be 
chairman of that i was no more loyal to anybody than ronald reagan 
i was enormously loyal to him and yet i did my work objectively 
and thoroughly along with my two colleagues on that commission and 
i think i received universal approval from the mass media on my 
objectivity and the critical nature of that report 
now to suggest that im going to be inordinately loyal to people 
that i have no connection with had no particular loyalty to in the 
first place except to the extent that i was bound to give them my 
best judgment on issues 
mr donaldson do you think 
sen tower i think my past performance and my proven record of 
integrity in public office speaks for itself and i dont think i 
have to apologize for it 
mr donaldson do you think you need to recuse yourself 
sen tower no no well ive already said i would recuse 
myself on issues of suspension or disbarment and thats enormously 
important the law doesnt even require me to do that now if you 
follow the nunnwarner criteria for what you want in a defense 
department official not just the secretary of defense but 
subordinate officials in the department of defense the deputy the 
undersecretary for acquisition it says they should be people 
experienced in defense 
and they anticipate and i think senator nunn has said that we 
expect to get people out of industry now my deputy whos coming 
on don atwood from general motors presided over hughes aviation 
which is a part of the general motors complex now is he to be 
considered inordinately influenced by the defense industry now 
youre going to have to go back and rewrite the nunnwarner criteria 
you have to bring people out of industry people whove been in 
industry as long as theyre people of honesty and integrity who 
know the process are the ones best qualified to save you money to 
make sure that your acquisition procedures are efficient and 
economical and honest 
mr will senator i have two questions one political and one 
personal on the political question youve counted a lot of votes 
in the senate and you must be looking at the senate now are you 
going to win and do you assume in doing so that youre going to 
get 45 republican votes 
sen tower i think i have to follow senator doles assessment of 
that and that is that the republicans will stick by me i have many 
friends among the democrats and i think that i have removed the 
principal cause for concern here today that most of them have 
expressed i think as you note a lot of the members of the 
committee itself said that they were inclined to support me 
senator glenn said so earlier on this show until this concern was 
raised 
so removing this concern i think gives me an opportunity not 
only to pick up democrats off the committee but to pick up 
democrats on the committee i hope that it will be accepted by 
senator nunn that he would change his mind senator nunn and i 
agree for the most part on most policy issues and i think well have 
a very good working relationship 
mr will this cant have been any fun for you the last three 
months have you ever just as a human interest side of this story 
have you ever decided that this is too much cost to you or your 
family and youd like to get out 
sen tower its already been costly to my family every time a 
new allegation appeared on television that i was keeping a soviet 
ballerina in an apartment in river oaks in houston and off the wall 
stuff like this i would get calls from my daughters in virtual 
tears i have three daughters and theyd call me on a daily basis 
this has been enormously difficult for them 
its also been difficult for people that ive been associated 
with who have been trampled in the rush to get at me i think some 
innocent people have suffered some women on my staff have suffered 
and unjustly so so thats also been a difficult thing for me to 
bear because when people go after you very often they dont care 
if they trample a few innocent people in the process and thats been 
done in this case 
ms roberts but senator its your own former committee why do 
you think its happening to you 
sen tower well i think its because of the honest concerns 
raised by senator nunn i really think i answered that question 
earlier most of the democrats said they were inclined to vote for 
me earlier but because of the concerns raised by the chairman they 
changed their minds and there is that loyalty to the chairman 
so i think that as we progress with this i would like to see the 
level of the rhetoric lowered id like to see it cooled off ive 
always had a good relationship with sam nunn and i think we can 
restore confidence in the pentagon with solid pentagon cooperation 
not only with senator nunn but with other appropriate leaders and 
committees of the congress and i think having been through this 
that it will go a long way toward restoring public confidence if i 
have proven my ability to cooperate 
mr will senator you were warmly recommended to the committee 
by senator bentsen do you think that an inference from that is that 
he may be one of your supporters 
sen tower im not going to try to predict how any individual 
senator can will vote senator bentsen and i worked together for 
14 years in the senate and although we are of differing different 
parties we never had a cross word with each other and always in 
the interests of our state and the nation we cooperated 
mr donaldson senator 
sen tower so i dont know how hell vote but he obviously 
from his presentation felt at the time he made that presentation 
that i was highly qualified 
mr donaldson senator going back to your no drinking pledge if 
youre confirmed whats the penalty if you should take a drink as 
secretary of defense would you think that you should then resign 
sen tower i think id be obliged to resign if i broke a pledge 
ive never broken a pledge in my life 
mr donaldson all right thank you very much senator tower we 
do appreciate your coming in here today

the report also expresses concern about the treatment including 
long prison sentences in recent years for 20 people who sought 
support for better working and living conditions in romania

a ruckus over the governments 
decision to let actor chuck norris build a beachfront mansion here 
is one of the campaign issues in mondays parliamentary elections 
parliament consists of only nine seats in this tiny british 
caribbean colony 
opposition parties accuse the governing anguilla national 
alliance of breaking its own policy of prohibiting foreigners from 
owning more than half an acre of residential property on this 
35square mile island inhabited by 7000 people 
norris a frequent visitor bought three quarters of an acre on 
the islands west side in 1985 and built a holiday mansion there 
chief minister emile gumbs whose party has a sixseat majority 
argues that the martial arts movie stars real estate on the island 
is a tourist attraction tourism is anguillas main industry 
meanwhile all politicians agree not to make an issue of 
anguillans resentment of their londonappointed governors 
excessive powers fearing it would fan the flames of something they 
all oppose independence 
though in practice the islands daily affairs are handled mostly 
by parliament gov geoffrey whitaker has veto power over the 
decisions of anguillas elected leaders 
british authorities in the past have said islanders must either 
accept the status quo or opt for independence which most of them 
oppose 
opposition groups running in mondays vote are the united party 
which controls two seats the democratic party with one seat and the 
tiny party for anguillas culturation and economy

miners in kosovo province decided 
sunday to continue their strike until they receive written 
assurances that three regional communist party officials will 
resign the state news agency said 
more than 1000 miners most of them albanians at the trepca 
lead and zinc mine have been striking since monday to press for 
changes in the regional leadership and to protest the serbian 
republics plans for greater control of kosovo one of its two 
autonomous provinces 
after intensive bargaining saturday night and sunday the miners 
decided to continue their strike until they receive written 
assurances that kosovo communist party leader rahman morina and two 
other local officials husamedin azemi and ali sukrija will step 
down the tanjug news agency said 
the three leaders ethnic albanians are considered by the miners 
to be proserbian politicians 
earlier in the day bashkim hisari a kosovo party presidium 
member told reporters that the miners requests would be discussed 
in a tolerant dialogue if they leave their mine at titova 
mitrovica 125 miles south of belgrade 
tanjug said at least 550 exhausted miners have requested medical 
assistance and one was reported in critical condition 
ilijaz nimani 42 one of the hospitalized miners told tanjug 
that when i recover i will join my comrades in the pits we plan 
to stay there until we die because the albanians are losing their 
rights 
he said serbian authorities want to close albanianlanguage 
schools and the university in the province where ethnic albanians 
are a majority 
a striking miner was quoted by radio belgrade sunday as saying 
i prefer to die in the pit than at home 
if nothing is resolved we have our plans the miner added 
he refused to elaborate 
riza muslimi a spokesman for the striking miners said saturday 
they had stashed two tons of explosives underground but he would 
not say whether they intended to use them to demolish the shaft if 
their demands were not met 
the protesters have condemned serbias drive to gain greater 
control over kosovo by changing the constitution fearing they would 
lose the wide autonomy granted to them in 1974 
the constitutional change would give serbia greater control over 
kosovo and its other province vojvodina and increase its powers 
over defense and state security the proposed change was approved by 
serbia on thursday but the amendments must also be approved by the 
provincial assemblies 
serbian leaders say they must have more control in kosovo to 
protect the mainly christian slav minority from alleged persecution 
by predominantly moslem ethnic albanians who make up 85 percent of 
the provinces population 
in november up to 100000 ethnic albanians demonstrated in 
pristina for five days to protest the dismissal of senior provincial 
officials as demanded by serbias leaders 
tanjug said yugoslav leaders have told the protesters the 
proposed constitutional changes do not mean a reduction of kosovos 
autonomy

the publisher of the satanic verses is willing 
to talk with moslems and would consider canceling the paperback 
edition to defuse the controversy over the novel a newspaper said 
sunday 
thousands of shiite moslems demonstrated in lebanon and iran in 
support of ayathollah ruhollah khomeinis demand that the books 
british author salman rushdie be killed 
a man claiming to represent an arab group said the furor over the 
novel could delay the release of foreign hostages in lebanon 
rushdie has been in hiding reportedly under police guard in 
britain since khomeini issued his death sentence feb 14 
viking penguin published the hardcover edition of the satanic 
verses in britain in september and the paperback edition is due 
out in fall some say the book insults islam 
the sunday times of london said viking penguin might rule out a 
paperback version if british moslems call off their protest and try 
to persuade islamic nations to do the same 
penguin also is willing to consider labeling the remaining unsold 
hardcover copies with a warning that says the book is a work of 
fiction the newspaper reported without citing sources 
efforts to reach the publishers failed sunday as offices were 
closed and no one answered the telephone 
british writers at a writers guild seminar in london unanimously 
supported rushdie on sunday we call upon world opinion to support 
the right of all people to express their ideas and beliefs the 
group said in a statement 
we request all world leaders to continue to repudiate the 
threats made against salman rushdie and his publishers and to take 
firm action to ensure that these threats are withdrawn it said 
the council for mosques in bradford home of britains largest 
moslem population called for a boycott of all viking penguin 
publications at a meeting sunday 
more than 60000 moslems live in the northern england community 
where demonstrators have burned copies of rushdies book 
the 41yearold rushdie born into a moslem family in india 
apologized for any distress his novel caused but khomeini rejected 
the apology 
about 5000 proiranian shiite moslems burned effigies of rushdie 
during a march in beirut lebanon on sunday 
leading the march were 20 members of hezbollah or party of god 
who wore white death shrouds inscribed in english and arabic we 
are ready to kill rushdie 
shiite suicide squads usually don death robes before going out on 
missions 
the iranianbacked hezbollah is believed to be the parent 
organization of shiite factions that hold most of the 15 foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
in the ancient eastern lebanon city of baalbek protesters 
carried banners signed islamic jihad or islamic holy war in 
support of the death threat 
islamic jihad is a shiite group holding two american hostages 
including terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press the longestheld hostage he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
a man claiming to speak for a previously unknown group the 
islamic revolutionary force in the world said the furor over 
the satanic verses and the wests angry reaction to khomeinis 
death threat will delay the release of the hostages 
there was no way to authenticate the claim made by an anonymous 
caller who telephoned a western news agency in beirut 
the man who spoke arabic said the group had ordered its members 
to assassinate rushdie between feb 27 and march 15 
tehran television reported thousands of moslems also demonstrated

the allegation saturday and said the training was under way at 
islamic cultural centers in bradford leicester manchester and 
london 
the chief imam at the manchester central mosque ahmad nasar beg 
said im sorry i dont know anything about that 
many moslems say the book insults islam by portraying the wives 
of the prophet mohammed as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the 
koran the moslem holy book rather than receiving it from god

president bush calling the united 
states a faithful friend and a dependable ally of south korea 
said monday he has no plans to reduce us troops stationed in this 
strifetorn nation the last stop on a whirlwind fiveday asian tour 
they will remain in the republic of korea as long as they are 
needed and as long as we believe it is in the interest of peace 
bush said in remarks prepared for a speech to the national assembly 
bush arrived at a private military airfield amid unusually 
stringent security because of a rash of recent antiamerican 
demonstrations the president made no mention of the oftenviolent 
protests in his prepared remarks but focused on the history of the 
us military presence that korean radicals want removed 
bush headed here after a twoday visit to china whose troops 
fought on the side of north korea in that 1950s conflict 
in 1950 when north korean forces invaded the south without 
hesitation or delay american and un forces rushed to your aid 
together americans and koreans fought sidebyside for your right 
to determine your own future bush said 
i remember the devastation of your country your cities lay in 
rubble your factories were in shambles millions of your people 
wandered the streets homeless and hungry 
while in beijing the president stressed new muchimproved us 
relations with china but his upbeat visit was marred by harassment 
of a leading dissident 
the dissident astrophysicist fang lizhi said his efforts to 
attend a farewell banquet hosted by bush were repeatedly frustrated 
by police even though he and his wife had been invited by the 
president 
white house officials said monday that bush voiced regret over 
the incident just before leaving china 
talking to reporters aboard air force one as bush headed to 
seoul white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush 
expressed regret over the incident in a brief chat with the 
chinese vice premier wu xueqian at the beijing airport just before 
boarding his plane 
fitzwater said bush did not learn of the incident until monday 
morning he said that bush also asked winston lord the us 
ambassador to china to get full details of the incident 
fitzwater also said bush felt that quiet diplomacy was the 
best way to pursue the human rights issue with chinese leaders 
the president feels that the visit was successful fitzwater 
said but he added that there are problems on both sides of 
course 
south koreas capital has been buffeted in recent weeks by 
violent antiamerican demonstrations as radical students demanded 
that the us bases be moved 
a security force 120000strong was mobilized to guard bush 
during his fivehour visit against threats both from student 
radicals and from north korean commandos 
in his speech bush likened the korean national assembly to the 
us congress full of noise contention and emotion 
but that is the sound of democracy at work he said 
throughout let our close economic and strategic relationship 
remain as it is a pillar of peace in east asia 
but while calling korea a world class economic power bush 
cited recent trade frictions between the two nations 
he called on south korea to do more to lower its barriers to us 
products citing the large us trade deficit with the nation and 
declaring protectionism is fools gold 
however the main thrust of the presidents remarks dealt with 
us troops 
our most important mission together is to maintain the freedom 
and democracy you fought so hard to win he said 
i have come here today as the leader of a faithful friend and a 
dependable allythere are no plans to reduce us forces in 
korea 
our soldiers and airmen are there at the request of the 
republic of korea and their presence contributes to the peace and 
stability of northeast asia 
at the same time bush voiced support for south korean president 
roh taewoos peaceful initiativesto build bridges to the 
north 
earlier brent scowcroft bushs national security adviser said 
theres been a lot of unrest theres been an antiamerican tone 
to some of it 
one of the reasons the president is going there is to reassure 
the south koreans of our support for their moves toward democracy 
and of the firmness of our strategic relationships scowcroft said 
of the incident involving the chinese dissident scowcroft said 
the president of course would hope that all of his guests would 
be allowed to attend the ushosted banquet 
fang holding a news conference in the hotel filing center used 
by reporters covering bushs visit said the car he was riding in 
was stopped by police several blocks from the banquet site 
then he said another officer prevented him from walking to the 
site and when he attempted to get to the us embassy to complain 
his taxi was stopped and buses were prevented from picking him up 
holding his invitations aloft he declined to directly criticize 
bush for not raising human rights issues in his talks with chinese 
leaders but he said the united states shouldnt hold china to a 
lesser standard than it holds the soviet union 
ive thought many times that democracy is a common concept all 
over the world he said 
the event at issue was a banquet at which bush served his guests 
texas barbecue 
presidential spokesman roman popadiuk said the issue of human 
rights was not raised per se in bushs talks 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the matter was 
discussed on lower levels including his own talks with chinas 
foreign minister 
it hasnt been done with big public fanfare and a lot of noise 
frankly we think that sometimes you make better progress with human 
rights when its done quietly and lowkey baker said on cbs 
face the nation 
i think the message got through loud and clear he said 
although the president alluded to the subject in a speech at a 
banquet saturday night most of his words in this capital have been 
filled with praise for chinese leaders

attending a banquet held by president bush on sunday white house 
officials said that bush voiced regret over the incident just before 
leaving the country 
after preventing fang lizhi from attending a dinner that bush 
hosted at the sheraton great wall hotel police tailed the dissident 
for an hour and a half after ordering a taxi and a bus not to pick 
him up 
bush had invited fang an internationally respected 
astrophysicist as a gesture of support for chinese intellectuals 
who have called for greater political freedom white house officials 
said 
talking to reporters aboard air force one as bush headed to 
seoul south korea white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said that bush expressed regret over the incident in a brief 
chat at the beijing airport just before the president boarded his 
executive jet 
bush raised the issue with chinese vice premier wu xueqian the 
highestranking chinese official to see the president off after 
bushs twoday visit 
fang was one of five human rights activists invited to the bush 
texasstyle barbecue dinner the other four were allowed to attend 
fitzwater said that bush did not learn of the incident until 
monday morning just before he was to depart he said that bush also 
asked winston lord the us ambassador to china to get full 
details of the incident 
fitzwater also said that bush felt that quiet diplomacy was 
the best way to pursue the human rights issue with chinese leaders 
the president feels that the visit was successful fitzwater 
said but he added that there are problems on both sides of 
course 
fang said in a telephone interview this really shows chinas 
attitude toward human rights 
he described the police action as weak and scared and added 
all i wanted to do was shake the hands of the president and mrs 
bush 
as the banquet ended a reporter yelled mr president what 
about human rights bush smiled but did not answer 
white house national security adviser brent scowcroft said later 
well the president of course would hope that all of his guests 
would be allowed to attend the dinner of course 
the police action came about an hour after communist party leader 
zhao ziyang said us support of chinese activism could harm 
relations between the countries 
perry link director of the us academy of sciences office in 
beijing said he and his wife were driving fang and his wife li 
shuxian to the banquet when police stopped them several blocks away 
for an alleged traffic violation 
they walked to the hotel but outside the entrance suddenly a 
swarm of plainclothes policemen surrounded us pulling fang lizhi 
and his wife and me and my wife apart link said 
he said the officers told fang he was not on the guest list the 
official guest list distributed at the banquet included fangs name 
the couples then walked to a nearby hotel to get a taxi but 
police stopped the taxi from picking up the group and then flagged 
down a bus and ordered it to drive by the four link said 
the four walked an hour and a half to lords residence and were 
followed all the way by police some plainclothes officers and 
others in marked cars link said 
a canadian diplomat saw them outside the locked residence and 
drove them to his home link said i was astounded by the scope of 
the net that had been put out for us link said 
he said he discussed the problem with the us embassy but 
embassy officials denied link spoke to them 
several hours later fang held an impromptu news conference at a 
beijing hotel he refused to criticize bush for not pressing chinese 
authorities to correct human rights abuses saying i have no 
comment because he is just beginning however he said the united 
states should not hold the soviet union to one human rights standard 
and other countries to another 
with his wife li shuxian by his side fang said he had no plans 
to halt his calls for democracy its a normal thing to attend a 
banquet but the authorities here are afraid of even that fang 
said holding aloft his banquet tickets 
western diplomats said chinese authorities had put heavy 
pressure on fang not to accept the banquet invitation 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said earlier that fang was 
invited as an astrophysicist an outstanding person in his field 
and also because of his human rights stand 
he said it was unlikely bush would have talked with fang 
fang gained international prominence when he was blamed for 
inciting prodemocracy student demonstrations that spread throughout 
china in early 1986 and 1987 
he was expelled from the communist party and fired from his job 
as professor at an anhui province university he has since been 
transferred to a job at the beijing university observatory 
in recent months fang has led a renewed movement among chinese 
intellectuals who want more democracy greater artistic freedoms and 
amnesty for political prisoners 
earlier zhao told bush that chinese advocates of westernstyle 
democracy could cause the nations economic reforms to fail and he 
issued a warning about support in the united states for those 
seeking political reforms in china 
some personages in american society who support those people 
who are dissatisfied with the chinese government will not contribute 
to the stability of chinas political situation and the undergoing 
of chinas reform nor will it be conducive to the friendship 
between china and the united states zhao was quoted as saying by 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing 
playwright wu zuguang a government critic who attended the 
banquet without interference said we all think this whole 
situation is very strange 
its strange and its stupid muttered su shaozhi a leading 
marxist theorist who has called for greater democracy and who also 
attended the banquet

president bush tried to tiptoe around human rights 
problems in china deciding not even to mention them but they came 
looking for him 
on the final night of bushs visit chinas leading dissident 
fang lizhi and his wife were prevented by police from attending a 
banquet hosted by the president they tried to get there by car 
taxi and bus but were stopped at each point police cited minor 
traffic violations and ultimately incorrectly informed the pair they 
were not on the guest list 
they had been invited as a gesture by bush toward chinese 
intellectuals who are calling for greater political freedom 
how did the white house react initially 
offering a mild mannered response white house national security 
adviser brent scowcroft said well the president of course would 
hope that all of his guests would be allowed to attend the dinner 
of course 
but the white house reacted more strongly in private according 
to press secretary marlin fitzwater 
talking to reporters as bush headed to seoul fitzwater said that 
bush expressed regret over the incident privately during a brief 
chat at the beijing airport with chinese vice premier wu xueqian 
fitzwater said that bush did not learn of the incident until 
monday morning just before he was to depart he said that bush also 
asked winston lord the us ambassador to china to get full 
details of the incident 
fitzwater also said that bush felt that quiet diplomacy was 
the best way to pursue the human rights issue with chinese leaders 
the president feels that the visit was successful fitzwater 
said but he added that there are problems on both sides of 
course 
but it was clear from the beginning that bush was not going to 
make human rights a burning issue 
on the day he flew to beijing bush said he was not aware of 
whether he was supposed to be carrying a list of human rights 
concerns he said hed be briefed on the flight 
human rights was not discussed white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater reported later as bush completed two days of talks 
with senior chinese leaders 
before he left washington bush had received a letter from more 
than 40 members of congress asking him to raise several human rights 
cases in beijing 
moreoever the state department long criticized as having its 
eyes closed to chinese repression in tibet recently joined in 
worldwide protest over treatment of ethnic tibetans 
bush told reporters friday that both the soviet union and china 
know of our commitment to human rights and it is beholden on any 
american president to reiterate our commitment to human rights 
despite fitzwaters statement about human rights not being 
discussed american and chinese officials said the subject was 
raised not by bush but by zhao ziyang general secretary of the 
communist party 
furthermore secretary of state james a baker iii said sunday 
that he discussed the topic in a meeting he had with the chinese 
foreign minister during the beijing trip he said on the cbstv 
program face the nation that they had a good discussion 
as to why soviet human rights especially under president reagan 
had received such pointed attention and official denouncements in 
contrast to the comparatively muted approach to china baker denied 
any double standard 
he china had begun opening up its political system and with 
respect to human rights a lot earlier than the soviet union did 
zhao gave bush what amounted to a lecture on the subject his 
message was to butt out 
according to chinas ministry of foreign affairs zhao updated 
bush about the countrys high inflation official corruption and 
other problems zhao said that critics of the governments economic 
policies were really trying to undo its political policies 
by complaining about government reforms the critics want to 
walk backwards zhao said 
we dont export our system to other countries nor do we copy 
the system of other countries the chinese leader said probably 
there are a number of people in the american press and the field of 
public opinion who support those people in china who are calling for 
the introduction of a multiparty political system 
zhao told bush that the realistic forces that promote chinese 
reform are the chinese government and the chinese people the fact 
that some personages in american society who support those people 
who are dissastified with the chinese government will not contribute 
to the stability of chinas political situation and chinas reform 
nor will it be conducive to the friendship betwen china and the 
united states zhao said 
throughout his stay bush seemed determined to stay away from 
controversy and to underscore his friendship with chinas leaders 
from his days as a us envoy in beijing in 197475

of chinese and americans look back upon this time theyll say that 
the winds of change blew favorably upon our lands 
fang the dissident who was barred from bushs party said he did 
not feel that the united states should hold beijing to a different 
standard than moscow on human rights 
ive thought many times that democracy is a common concept all 
over the world fang said sunday night freedom of speech

a former bank employee and postal worker 
who pinched pennies by living in ymcas and spending as little as 6 
a day on food died with 249746 in eight banks across the country 
and no apparent heirs 
howard thomas drummonds 49aweek room at the lansing ymca had 
no bathroom and he bought three 199 breakfasts each morning 
saving two of them in a knapsack for later meals those who knew him 
recalled 
while his raggedy clothes and miserly way of life kept his wealth 
secret drummond apparently attended to his fortune said paul 
rosenbaum the stateappointed lawyer handling drummonds estate 
rosenbaum said drummond who was 77 when he died jan 28 in 
sparrow hospital after suffering a stroke has no known family and 
unless relatives are found his money will go to michigans general 
fund 
to my knowledge he just wanted to live his life and be left 
alone darnelle jones room manager at the ymca told the lansing 
state journal in sundays editions i think there were people that 
looked at him and said thats too bad he said im fine 
it looked like he came right out of the 1930s said vern 
wright who works at the post office where drummond had a post box 
and that old hat he wore must have been 30 years old he was 
trying to wear it out 
wright said postal workers always suspected drummond had money 
somewhere because they noticed mail from banks and subscriptions to 
psychology today the saturday evening post and foreign affairs 
other lansing residents who knew of drummond said he bought two 
newspapers and always read the stock tables 
according to notes found by rosenbaum drummond held a job in a 
bank in pasadena calif until being drafted in 1942 he was 
honorably discharged from the army in 1946 and returned to the bank 
where he was fired in 1956 after being accused of stealing tape and 
other items according to the notes 
rosenbaum said drummond was hired by the us postal service and 
remained in pasadena until he retired in 1973 
he later moved to denver where he stayed until 1981 working in 
the ymca membership office then he began roaming the east coast 
from ymca to ymca opening up bank accounts along the way in denver 
he left 6707457 when he died and more than 23000 in boston 
rosenbaum said 
by the time he died he was earning more than 20000 a year in 
interest and government pensions

when political leaders arrived 
at the presidential palace to report on their meeting with rebel 
commanders they found chief executive jose napoleon duarte flanked 
by his military advisers 
the seating arrangement at fridays encounter was no coincidence 
the armed forces which never took the rebels ideas for this 
years presidential election at face value demonstrated their 
continued influence some would say domination in politics 
throughout recent weeks 
the proposal by leftist rebels to postpone the march 19 
presidential election to allow them time to participate appeared 
doomed by last weekend though all involved hesitated to say so 
publicly none relished the stigma of spoiler 
on sunday night duarte made a counter offer proposing to let 
the salvadoran people vote on whether to accept the rebels offer 
he offered a ceasefire this week and a meeting between rebels and 
the government 
speaking on nationwide radio and television duarte suggested 
opening peace talks with the rebels starting tuesday after immediate 
agreement by the government and insurgents to a ceasefire 
the guerrillas plan represented a dramatic turnabout for rebels 
waging a nineyear civil war against the usbacked government 
the guerrillas had boycotted condemned and done all they could 
to impede the five previous national elections this decade they 
contend elections have been part of a usimposed counterinsurgency 
project to provide a facade of democratic civilian rule over an 
edifice of military repression 
after the rebels made their proposal the countrys 13 political 
parties sent representatives to two days of talks to discuss it with 
four rebel leaders at a mexican resort 
the insurgents originally proposed putting off the election until 
september to give them time to marshal their political forces and 
take part in mexico they said they could go along with an election 
in july 
the rebels also called for security and antifraud guarantees 
in exchange they promised to recognize the legitimacy of the 
government that arose from the vote implicitly accepting that 
armed struggle would then be illegitimate 
soon after the mexico meeting the defense ministry declared its 
stand 
postponing the election until september is impossible 
defense minister gen carlos vides casanova told reporters invoking 
the constitution 
at first some parties also had constitutional qualms about 
putting off the vote but those were overcome in most cases when 
some jurists said it could be done legally 
postponement would have required consensus among the parties but 
that prospect was virtually nil before the politicians even went to 
mexico 
no one in mexico had the right or faculty to agree to 
postponement francisco merino vicepresidential candidate for 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena told the 
associated press on friday 
postponement he said could bring even bigger problems to the 
country because it could divide the armed forces 
mario aguinada leader of the leftist nationalist democratic 
union told the ap last week that rightist and centrist parties 
which may have been tempted to consider the guerrilla proposal were 
dissuaded by the militarys uncompromising stance 
they were scared he said 
arena soundly defeated the incumbent christian democrats in 
legislative and municipal elections last year and it is also 
favored to take the presidential palace from the christian democrats 
in the upcoming elections it never indicated a willingness to 
accept postponement 
however one party leader who had gone to mexico told journalists 
friday that even the christian democrats balked at anything more 
than a brief delay during the meetings there 
if the vote were postponed more than a couple of months the 
legislature would have to name an interim president arena controls 
the legislature and presumably would name one of its own members 
fear of losing the campaign advantage of incumbency motivated the 
christian democrats to block postponement according to several 
participants speaking on condition of anonymity 
this proposal though dead may have boosted longterm peace 
propects 
the guerrillas have been pursuing a twolane strategy of 
combat and negotiation guillermo ungo presidential candidate of 
leftist democratic convergence said in an interview friday he is 
formally allied with the rebel army 
the two aspects do not exclude each other they complement each 
other he said 
the guerrillas in response to rejection of their proposal say 
they intend to step up attacks sharply in coming months 
but ungo said the negotiating lane has not been definitively 
blocked 
this guerrilla offer does not remain valid it was tailored 
for this moment what remains valid is the idea of negotiation he 
said

a convicted murderer who was freed 
because of jail crowding remained at large sunday authorities said 
sheriffs spokesman sherry rainey would not comment on whether 
efforts were under way to locate felton singleton 
singleton 19 was convicted thursday night of firstdegree 
murder in the oct 7 shooting death of darreld jackson 24 at a 
convenience store parking lot 
singleton was sentenced to 25 years in prison but pulaski county 
sheriffs deputies refused to pick him up after his trial saying 
their jail had reached capacity as mandated by federal court orders 
circuit judge jack lessenberry ordered singleton freed no bond 
was posted although once singleton is in custody he will be 
expected to post 15000 bond to be freed pending appeal ms rainey 
said 
singletons attorney ralph cloar jr said he did not expect to 
hear from his client until monday 
he got an unexpected vacation or whatever cloar said 
saturday they just made a booboo 
ms rainey said a series of mistakes occurred a booking sergeant 
miscounted the number of prisoners thursday and concluded no jail 
space was available the sergeant then failed to alert a shift 
sergeant of singletons impending arrival so no alternative housing 
arrangements were made until after lessenberry freed singleton 
asked saturday whether his court should be responsible for 
rounding up singleton lessenberry said i dont have a gun he 
suggested the sheriffs office study applicable law 
cloar said singleton is the responsibility of the sheriffs 
office but ms rainey said she was not sure who should be 
responsible 
its a shame he should have been incarcerated ms rainey 
said 
however our consent decree doesnt say 200 persons capacity 
unless someone is convicted of murder the federal court orders 
limit the jail to 200 prisoners 
jail population had shifted by saturday so that space was 
available for singleton she said

riot police on sunday battled 
demonstrators protesting president bushs visit and dispersed 
students shouting antius slogans in two cities police and 
dissidents said 
on monday police arrested 15 dissidents who tried to march to 
the us embassy to protest the bush visit and present a letter 
condemning the united states 
bush arrived in seoul on monday for a fivehour visit to hold 
talks with president roh taewoo and to address the national 
assembly he later flies home to washington 
in the southern city of pusan sunday thousands of riot police 
sealed off a downtown temple blocking an antiamerican rally but 
triggering violent street protests the yonhap news agency reported 
it said bands of protesters hurling firebombs and rocks fought 
running street battles with police who fired tear gas at least 34 
protesters were arrested it said 
similar clashes erupted in the western port city of inchon when 
police dispersed protesters trying to attend an antibush rally 
dissident sources said 
bush yankee go home hundreds of youths shouted as they 
pelted police with firebombs 
four korean reporters were injured when police brandishing clubs 
charged about 100 demonstrators trying to march from an inchon 
church yonhap said 
in sunchon 168 miles south of seoul 20 youths firebombed an 
unoccupied prosecutors office smashing windows and burning some 
fixtures yonhap also reported 
dissidents and radical students have called for demonstrations 
against the roh government and bushs visit but their rallies have 
drawn only small numbers 
south koreas 120000 police have been placed on top alert 
on monday police maintained tight security around us 
facilities to guard against threatened radical attacks 
about 15 prominent dissidents shouting slogans and carrying 
pictures of bush with red crosses drawn through them were seized and 
hauled away after trying to assemble about a block from the us 
embassy in downtown seoul 
no bush visit the small band shouted before they were 
overwhelmed by charging police who kicked and punched some of the 
protesters 
minutes after the protest bushs helicopter passed overhead on 
its way to the nearby presidential mansion the blue house to be 
received by roh 
three dissident leaders attempted to walk peacefully to the 
embassy moments after the protest was broken up by riot police but 
the police blocked the sidewalk and eventually dragged the leaders 
away

people since the division of the korean peninsula the letter said 
the radicals claim rohs government is a military dictatorship 
controlled by the united states they want to oust roh and expell 
the 42000 us troops based in south korea under a mutual defense 
treaty 
the united states is scheming through bushs visit to 
perpetuate the division of the korean peninsula stabilize the 
military dictatorship and heighten tensions said the united 
national democratic movement of korea the main dissident alliance 
radical students have little public support because of their 
extreme views but they can assemble thousands of activists and 
often clash with riot police in seoul and other cities

a cargo door problem on a united airlines jet 
forced cancellation of a flight to hong kong sunday the day the 
airline said it ordered inspections of the doors because of fridays 
deadly inflight accident near hawaii 
a united spokesman said however that the incident at 
seattletacoma international airport was not related to the special 
inspections 
in the seattle case an electric motor that closes a latch on the 
cargohold door was found to be faulty united said 
the boeing 747 that was to have flown to hong kong had already 
been through the inspection when the motor problem was discovered 
said russell mack a united spokesman in chicago 
he said the motor was repaired in one to two hours but by then 
crew scheduling problems forced the flight to be delayed until 
monday morning 
because the right forward cargo door was part of the 747 that 
ripped away in flight last week killing nine people officials said 
they checked all cargo doors on uniteds fleet of 31 747s and all 
were found to be in proper working order 
in addition a detailed technical inspection of all latches 
seals fittings and other parts of the door mechanisms was to be 
completed sunday 
mack said the incident in seattle was entirely unrelated to the 
special inspections that we have been doing this weekend he said 
the motor turns a cam that closes a latch he added that the latch 
can also be closed manually 
it was simply a repair that needed to be done he said

the explosive ripping open of united air lines 
oldest boeing 747 over the pacific ocean came as an air safety task 
force was about to propose mandatory work on all aging boeing 
airliners 
investigators consider structural failure a likely cause 
although a mechanical problem human error or sabotage have not been 
ruled out for the incident friday in which nine passengers died 
no matter the cause the geriatric jumbo jet sitting on the 
tarmac at hickam air force base in honolulu with a 10by40foot 
hole in its side provided a graphic new illustration of continuing 
concern over the safety of commercial aviation 
two days before the harrowing sky drama the head of boeing f 
a shrontz had declared in a speech we believe fundamentally 
that with proper maintenance and proper inspection an airplane can 
in fact last forever 
shrontz added however that at some point economics catch up 
and the cost of inspection and the cost of updating just overwhelm 
the equation 
boeing and united officials stressed the heroic effort of the 
pilot in bringing flight 811 safely in with the remaining 345 people 
aboard and the stability of the aircraft in holding together as it 
returned to honolulu for an emergency landing 
but the incident raised questions about conditions that would 
allow such a gaping hole to open up in the side of an airliner and 
the integrity of all older airliners questions addressed by the 
aging aircraft task force set up by the air transport association 
even before the flight 811 tragedy the task force had scheduled 
a news conference here tuesday to make recommendations that are 
expected to include mandatory repairs modifications and 
replacements of parts on older boeing 747s 737s and 727s 
recommendations on airliners built by other manufacturers are to 
come later this year 
the federal aviation administration which is represented on the 
task force would have to take action before the proposals would 
become binding 
although the transport association represents airlines the 
150member task force includes us and european aviation experts 
and government regulatory officials as well as representatives of 
airliner manufacturers and professional mechanics organizations 
mandatory updating of airliners could be a costly departure from 
the regime of inspectionrelated work the faa now requires it also 
could increase the pressure on airlines to get rid of their 
mostused aircraft if the changes send the cost of maintaining an 
old aircraft beyond that of purchasing a new one 
aviation analyst paul turk of the appraisal firm of avmark says 
only about 15 old airliners have been voluntarily sent to the scrap 
heap by major us airlines in the last decade others have received 
complete overhauls often including new engines and been sold to 
charter outfits cargo haulers or for other uses 
in recent years with air travel increasing worldwide the value 
of even older airliners has increased like the value of real estate 
the airline industry is now a major attraction for investors with 
about 40 percent of us airliners leased by the carriers 
avmark puts the average age of airliners flown by major us 
carriers at nearly 13 years uniteds fleet among the older ones 
1487 years when the latest analysis was run eight months ago about 
half of uniteds 387 planes are more than 16 years old 
the oldest fleets belong to northwest 1547 years trans world 
airlines 1529 and eastern 1511 years the newest group of 
airliners is flown by delta 948 years 
but aviation experts say the raw age of an airliner has little to 
do with its economic value or its safety 
each aircraft has a different life situation said pat murphy 
of avitas another independent aviation appraisal firm the numbers 
of takeoffs and landings hours flown the flying environment and 
the quality of maintenance all have an impact on an airliners life 
expectancy murphy said 
uniteds plane was 18 years old but had relatively few 
takeofflanding cycles less than 15000 that is onesixth the 
number of the aloha 737 whose roof split open over hawaii last april 
the damaged united aircraft which rolled off the boeing assembly 
line in november 1970 would be subject to modifications under the 
task force proposals newer 747s 757s and 767s would not be 
affected 
details of the recommendations have not been disclosed but the 
group is not expected to propose that any class of airliners be 
retired or that any maximum age flying hours or number of takeoffs 
and landings be set for mandatory retirement 
its proposals will be based on examination of boeing service 
bulletins which document problems airlines have had with individual 
models and often lead to faa directives said transport association 
spokesman tim neale 
the group also has been examining airlines programs for 
corrosion prevention and control structural inspection and repair 
to see whether additional action is needed he said

with a 30day coolingoff period coming to an end a 
battle of propaganda and psychology is heating up between eastern 
airlines and its machinists union 
videos are being filmed and distributed letters massmailed 
brochures and booklets are rolling off presses postcard campaigns 
are under way news articles are being reprinted and news media 
offices are receiving neardaily fax and federal express deliveries 
from each side 
much of the action in these final days before a potentially 
devastating strike is taking place away from the bargaining table 
in a struggle for hearts and minds 
although federal mediation efforts continue both sides are ready 
for a strike at 1201 am saturday the end of the coolingoff 
period set by the national mediation board there havent been signs 
of progress toward a settlement in negotiations that began 17 months 
ago but president bush could at least put off a strike for 60 days 
by appointing an emergency board to investigate the eastern 
situation 
eastern losing 1 million a day says it cant afford more 
delaying actions by a union it says refuses to face the failing 
carriers economic realities by accepting 150 million in pay cuts 
the machinists favor the presidential board saying outside 
intervention is needed because they believe management wants a 
strike to try to bust the union 
theres more to the easternmachinists showdown than the looming 
walkout of the 8500 mechanics baggage handlers ramp workers and 
janitors represented by the machinists comprising about 30 percent 
of easterns work force 
for a successful strike machinists leaders say they probably 
will need help from the pilots and flight attendants and also hope 
for supportive actions from the national machinists union other 
airline industry workers and from the public 
eastern meanwhile has been negotiating with its pilots in hopes 
they will cross machinists picket lines reportedly has been hiring 
replacement workers and is expected to call on parent texas air 
corp and its other subsidiaries particularly continental airlines 
for help 
it is expected that management supervisors would return to the 
line to keep the airline flying should there be a strike eastern is 
counting on its strong frequenttraveler traffic to continue with 
many fliers willing to ignore the strike to keep building up their 
bonus miles eastern fliers the past two weeks have received coupons 
good for onethird discounts if they fly during the three weeks 
starting march 4 
eastern tells its other employees in its brochures and employee 
bulletins that the machinists refusal to make the wage sacrifices 
made by the other unions has crippled the carrier while the other 
unions made 20 percent wage concessions in 1986 eastern says the 
machinists refusal forced the sale of eastern to texas air 
it portrays machinists district 100 president charles e bryan as 
an egotistic nearmaniac who wants to run the airline himself 
if charlie isnt stopped he will destroy eastern said a 
redcolored booklet titled charlie says distributed last 
week among eastern managers 
since charlie took office in early 1980 eastern airlines and 
its employees have suffered to the point that easterns existence is 
in grave question the booklet says he has caused great harm to 
this company to achieve his personal goal of owning and running the 
company 
bryan says eastern employees have suffered for years of bad 
management and now have owners with no commitment to the future he 
says more employee influence on the carrier would spur productivity 
and improve service 
the machinists countered with mailings of a fortune magazine 
miniprofile of texas air chairman frank lorenzo that described him 
as one of americas toughest bosses but not a very effective one 
the machinists warn fellow employees that lorenzo doesnt care 
about easterns future but wants only to milk its cash assets 
although eastern reportedly has been talking to the pilots about 
a fence agreement aimed at strengthening job security and 
easterns viability machinists leaders hope the pilots will side 
with fellow employees over a management they say cant be trusted 
if we go down the pilots and flight attendants will follow 
said frank ortis machinists local 702 vice president lorenzo 
will dismantle the airline

the nations largest savings and loan home 
savings of america said it wants to convert into a savings bank so 
it can avoid the burden of the bush administrations savings and 
loan bailout proposal 
home savings said it has applied to regulatory agencies to merge 
into its bowery savings bank subsidiary in order to become a savings 
bank 
applications were made to the federal deposit insurance corp and 
the federal home loan bank board for home savings to become an 
fdicinsured federal savings bank said richard h deihl chairman 
and chief executive officer of home savings and bowery savings bank 
bowery savings banks deposits currently are insured by the fdic 
the bank was acquired by home savings of america in january 1988 
if we remain in the fslic federal savings amp loan insurance 
corp and the bush administrations proposal is adopted in its 
present draft form home savings of america by virtue of the fact 
that we have the largest deposit base of any us savings 
institution will be forced to bear the largest cost burden to 
resolve the problems of the fslic problems we did not create and 
which arose from policies we strongly oppose deihl said in a 
statement friday 
the bush administration wants to rescue the ailing sampl industry 
by selling 50 billion in bonds to raise money needed to close 
insolvent institutions 
the plan would strip the fslic from its parent agency the 
federal home loan bank board and merge it into the fdic which 
guarantees bank deposits 
it also includes raising sampl premiums from 208 per 1000 in 
deposits to 230 bank premiums would go from 83 cents to 150 
deihl said home savings of america earned an aftertax profit of 
1 billion over the past five years and last year was the largest 
home mortgage lender in the nation the sampl also has paid more than 
170 million in deposit insurance premiums to the fslic over the 
last four years 
home savings paid nearly 50 million in deposit insurance 
premiums in 1988 alone including 45 million to the fslic covering 
244 billion of fslicinsured deposits and 4 million to fdic for 
bowery savings banks 51 billion deposit base the company said 
deihl added under the current fdic insurance premium 
structure premium costs on the companys 295 billion deposit base 
would have been 25 million half the amount paid last year even 
if fdic premiums doubled from present levels homes deposit costs 
for fdic insurance would still be well below that paid in 1988 
allan bortel an analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc said 
the thrifts move is their way of saying were mad as hell and 
wont take it any more 
regulatory approval of the merger is necessary including 
approval of a nov 1 1988 application to convert the bowery 
savings bank to a federally chartered savings bank the bank is now 
a new york statechartered institution 
home savings of america with assets of 40 billion is the 
principal subsidiary of hf ahmanson amp co home savings of america 
including the bowery savings bank and savings of america divisions 
operates 352 branches in nine states and 104 mortgage lending 
offices in 18 states

a state agency is lobbying congress to consider a 
bank bailout program in which stockholders of failing banks would 
not lose all of their investment 
the texas banking department believes the idea would save the 
government money and prevent some banks from failing 
federal deposit insurance corp policy requires that stockholders 
lose all their equity whenever the agency advances money to prop up 
a troubled bank 
we think its important that public money not be provided for 
shareholders fdic spokesman alan whitney said 
the fdics policy applies both to routine bank failures and to 
openbank assistance transactions in which private capital combines 
with government money to save a bank the banking department 
proposal would apply only to openbank deals 
the banking department believes the proposal would give a failing 
banks owners incentive to raise private money thereby reducing the 
fdics costs 
if you can get ahead of some of these problems before the bank 
closes it cant help but be cheaper for the system said steve 
scurlock deputy banking commissioner 
scurlock presented the plan to us rep steve bartlett of dallas 
for consideration bartlett said he notified fdic chairman l 
william seidman about the plan and discussed stockholder bailouts 
with him 
the banking department hopes the proposal is considered as part 
of president bushs bill to rescue failing savings and loans 
under the proposal bank management also would receive additional 
incentive to save a failing bank the proposal would allow a banks 
top managers to keep their jobs instead of automatically losing them 
as dictated by current fdic policy 
the fdic had no comment on the plan whitney said 
he said the fdic occasionally has provided existing shareholders 
with a stake in a recapitalized bank in the case of last years 
rescue of first city bancorp of texas for instance shareholders 
kept a 2 percent stake in the new first city 
the banking department proposal specifies that existing 
stockholders suffer more dilution of their ownership than in cases 
in which private sources inject all the fresh capital but the plan 
does not specify how much dilution only that is it considerable 
bartlett believes the existing openbank assistance law gives the 
fdic a powerful vehicle to raise private capital for failing banks 
but the fdic inadequately uses the law
