lech walesa drew cheers in this cradle of 
american liberty on sunday when he held aloft the citys freedom 
award which martial law had prevented him from getting in 1981 
and declared we are free now 
in the morning the solidarity leader paused from his goodwill 
tour of the united states to pray at the national shrine of our 
lady of czestochowa in suburban doylestown where he was joined by 
an estimated crowd of 10000 who shouted welcome in polish 
during the mass said in polish by cardinal john krol retired 
archbishop of philadelphia walesa was hailed as a great son of 
poland a man of unshakable faith and enduring courage 
walesa spent the afternoon urging union members to support their 
counterparts throughout the world he also picked up the freedom 
award and another honor touched the liberty bell and ended his 
philadelphia visit with a private reception in independence hall 
walesas stop in philadelphia was the next to the last in this 
country he arrived in washington a week ago and after a stop in 
new jersey was headed for venezuela on monday 
walesa flew in from chicago on saturday night chicago said to 
have the largest number of people of polish descent of any city 
except warsaw gave walesa a rousing welcome including a rally that 
attracted 20000 people despite freezing temperatures 
during his us visit he has also met with the president 
addressed a joint session of congress and had numerous meetings 
with business and industry leaders in his quest to find more 
investors in the troubled polish economy 
the nobel peace prize laureate ended his whirlwind tour sunday 
night with a visit to st hedwigs roman catholic church in 
trenton nj where he laid a wreath at a shrine for father jerzy 
popieluszko the polish activist priest who was murdered five years 
ago 
as walesa entered the church he was greeted by loud applause 
and the singing of the polish national anthem by about 1500 
polishamericans many of those gathered stood on pews and had 
tears in their eyes 
i am an example of the small person who can do great things 
walesa told the assembly i am proof of the adage that faith can 
move mountains i believe in freedom and liberty and in democracy 
and i didnt have an army 
earlier sunday in philadelphia walesa said that he was putting 
business aside for the day and instead urged listeners to ponder 
the chain of events that brought a measure of democracy to his 
country over the past year 
let us remember the road behind us he said through an 
interpreter at a ceremony after a breakfast in suburban fort 
washington maybe we have to think over what we have done maybe 
we have to remember 
he then rang a lifesize replica of the liberty bell a symbol of 
american freedom three times to emphasize his words 
the breakfast was sponsored by the copernicus society a 
polishamerican philanthropic group one of the guests former us 
supreme court chief justice warren burger counseled walesa on how 
to build checks and balances into a new government 
burger told walesa that he hoped poles look to our experience 
that we divided the power among three equal branches of 
government judicial executive and legislative that has been 
what has preserved human liberty he said 
also attending the gathering was author james michener who 
lives in nearby new hope i cannot tell you how excited someone 
like me is to see the collapse of a false idea that could rule 
the people but not feed them michener said that is a 
revolution of a magnitude that staggers me 
a few miles away in doylestown the morning temperatures were in 
the 20s but thousands gathered on the sloping sunlit meadow in 
front of the shrine and cathedral hours before walesa showed up for 
the mass 
walesa spoke after the service starting from a prepared text 
and then dropping his notes to speak from the heart 
we are building a proud poland we are building a faithful 
poland we are building a poland for all poles he said as the 
crowd reacted with cheers to his unprepared remarks next to him 
was folk singer joan baez who sang a 1980 solidarity strike song 
after the mass walesa traveled downtown to meet with about 100 
area union leaders at the headquarters of the international ladies 
garment workers union in philadelphia walesa asked the audience to 
join with him to protect the rights of working people everywhere 
people in many regions of the world are in need of our common 
support some people are even now jumping over the fence as i did 
10 years ago said walesa who first came to prominence when he 
jumped over a fence to join striking lenin shipyard workers in 
gdansk poland 
from the union hall he walked to the home of american 
revolution hero thaddeus kosciuszko where he received the freedom 
award and then paraded with a string band to the polishamerican 
cultural center 
as he walked to the entry of the historic home walesa dove into 
the crowd shaking hands to cheering and whistling walesa held 
the medal aloft and spoke of his homeland in 1981 when he was 
awarded the honor but unable to collect it because of martial law 
its clear that eight years ago i couldnt have carried this 
medal of freedom to a country that isnt free he said we are 
free now 
at the liberty bell walesa received a copy of the citys 
liberty medal a 100000 award established this year to recognizes 
leadership in the pursuit of liberty the presentation was a 
formality because walesas wife danuta had accepted the medal 
during a ceremony july 4th 
as hobart cawood director of the independence national historic 
park explained how the bell rang to signal the declaration of 
independence more than 200 years ago walesa studied the bells 
crack 
perhaps modern technology could stop this crack he asked 
smiling the crowd of invited dignitaries laughed 
as hundreds of people outside chanted we want lech walesa 
turned and flashed two fingers in a v saying this should be 
the medal of freedom and liberty and victory as well 
in new jersey sunday night walesa was a dinner guest at the 
princeton estate of barbara piasecka johnson the 52yearold 
polishborn woman who inherited much of the johnson amp johnson 
pharmaceutical fortune 
mrs johnson in june announced that she would spend up to 100 
million for a 55 percent interest in the lenin shipyard in gdansk 
where the solidarity movement was first kindled by walesa in 1980 
the shipyard was scheduled to be shut down by polands communist 
government who said it was unprofitable

zoo veterinarians failed to remove a dead 
300pound fetus from an asian elephant saturday and plan to 
attempt a risky caesarean section monday to save the mother 
veterinarians fear jean the floppyeared 19year old mother 
could die a slow painful death if the decomposing fetus is not 
removed said san diego wild animal park spokesman tom hanscom 
but the caesarean poses a high risk of infection hanscom said 
we are extremely worried he said 
we wished to avoid a caesarean because it is such a major 
surgical operation the spokesman said 
even if the operation is successful the healing process could 
take months hanscom said 
four veterinary surgeons will perform the threehour procedure 
including joe forner a veterinary surgeon from the illinois equine 
clinic jim oosterhuis the parks director of veterinary services 
will supervise the operation 
veterinarians confirmed friday that jean was carrying a dead 
fetus hanscom said the baby died in september from fetal distress 
after its legs were thrown forward and became wedged in the birth 
canal during labor 
officials had believed the pachyderms pregnancy to be a record 
when it surpassed that of an asian elephant that went 720 days 
before giving birth at a german zoo the average term of pregnancy 
for such elephants is 618 to 668 days 
veterinarians attempted but failed saturday to reposition the 
fetus so they could pull and remove it hanscom said at 300 
pounds the fetus was too large and too far into the birth canal 
for veterinarians to move it successfully 
jean has responded to the procedures amazingly well hanscom 
said 
she has sat through four fairly stressful exams now he 
said she came through it with flying colors and is up on her 
feet but she is showing signs of stress and has visibly lost 
weight

defense secretary dick cheney now says there 
is evidence the soviet union has cut military spending during 1989 
in an assessment that comes after weeks of confusing and 
conflicting statements on the issue by administration officials 
its clear that there are now signs in 89 that defense 
spending may be turning down in connection with what was said 
previously cheney said saturday but again youre talking 
about intelligence reports and you ahve to put together bits and 
pieces of information before you draw final conclusions 
having emphasized the inexact nature of assessing the soviet 
military budget cheney added on cnns evans amp novak that 
its fair to say that in fact there is evidence that the soviets 
are scaling down their conventional activities and their overall 
level of defense spending 
on the same show cheney reiterated his longheld position that 
the odds are against soviet president mikhail s gorbachev being 
able to transform the soviet union into a modern society 
i remain of the opinion that the likelihood of that happening 
is still remote that the obstacles he has to deal with are in 
fact enormous said cheney i wish him the very best but i 
dont think we could base our policies on the assumption that he 
will be successful 
cheneys acknowledgement of soviet military spending cuts came 
through his spokesman late friday a day after house armed services 
committee chairman les aspin dwis accused the administration of 
deliberately witholding intelligence information in order to 
strengthen its case for pentagon spending 
were not hiding anything cheneys spokesman pete williams 
said when asked about aspins criticism 
the washington post reported saturday that cheney had said in an 
interview that the military threat from the warsaw pact has 
diminished enough to begin planning to make significant 
reductions in us military spending next year 
while you need to be concerned about possible reversal of 
trends in the soviet union theres a real sense that you want to 
take advantage of these developments cheney was quoted as saying 
a senior defense department official saturday night confirmed 
that the pentagon chief has ordered the armed services to draw up 
plans for cutting 180 billion in projected spending during fiscal 
years 199294 that would represent an average annual drop of about 
5 percent in spending over the threeyear period 
it appears that the reason for the earlier confusion over soviet 
military spending was due to something that happens once in a while 
in washington reporters got information before senior 
administration officials did 
the brouhaha was touched off after the new york times quoted 
us analysts as saying that they had indications the soviets have 
cut military spending this year in line with promises made by 
gorbachev 
up until that time administration officials including 
president bush vice president dan quayle secretary of state james 
a baker iii cheney and several of their aides pointed to 
increases in soviet spending of roughly 3 percent a year for the 
past several years 
the military spending contrary to all these statements that 
are going on in the soviet union over the last four years has 
increased the united states has decreased its military spending 
not the soviet union quayle said in a television appearance on 
nov 5 
bush asked several days later if he agreed with quayle said 
yes id like to see find a way to reverse that through 
negotiations with gorbachev 
the publication soviet military power prospects for change 
which was published by the administration in may noted that 
gorbachev has announced he intends to reduce his defense budget by 
142 percent over the next two years 
however it added that since 1985 soviet defense expenditures 
have increased by an average of 3 percent a year in real terms 
while us defense spending has declined in real terms by over 11 
percent during the same time period 
but after the times report appeared this past week confusion 
grew 
state department spokesman margaret tutweiler was queried about 
it and she replied it does appear that soviet defense spending 
this year is less than it was last year we have seen evidence of 
cuts in soviet defense efforts 
williams asked the same question declined on tuesday to offer 
an assessment saying i dont think we know precisely what 89 
spending is going to be until 1989 is over 
aspin in a speech on thursday then accused the administration 
of making statements that are outdated at best and absolutely 
false at worst and blocking the american people from getting 
information that would allow them to make decisions about us 
defense spending priorities 
president bush should uncork the intelligence bottleneck and 
trust the american people to make the correct decision when given 
correct information aspin said 
asked for cheneys response to aspins remarks williams said 
the secretary now says there is some evidence the soviets are 
scaling down their conventional spending and their overall level of 
defense spending 
williams said confusion arose after information about soviet 
spending was given to some reporters by intelligence officials 
before their organization relayed its updated information to senior 
administration officials 
the spokesman said that cheney could offer no details about his 
new assessment of soviet military spending 
it would be very useful if the soviets would tell us what 
their budget is so we dont have to go through this exercise of 
estimating it williams said its ironic that were getting 
beaten up about providing information that a closed society should 
be providing to us 
williams said he stands by his comments that a full picture of 
the soviet spending wont be available until us analysts have a 
chance to digest available information and the administration 
releases its traditional estimate in the spring 
this is still preliminary information its raw stuff it just 
popped out of the system before the system had a chance to analyze 
it the pentagon spokesman said

buck helm the burly longshoreman who 
survived 90 hours in the rubble of a freeway flattened in the oct 
17 bay area earthquake died saturday night hospital officials 
said 
perhaps the quakes most famous survivor helm who turned 58 on 
nov 10 died of respiratory failure at 730 pm pst at kaiser 
permanente medical center said hospital spokesman ronald treleven 
he said attempts to resuscitate helm were unsuccessful 
rescue workers were stunned to find helm alive in his squashed 
car in a 1mile collapsed section of interstate 880 the 
doubledecked nimitz freeway in oakland four days after the 
71magnitude quake struck northern california 
his condition recently had improved slightly treleven said 
helm had been taken off a kidney dialysis machine and doctors had 
hoped they might soon be able to take him off a respirator that 
enabled him to breathe 
we were very surprised we were very saddened treleven said 
helms death brought the quakes overall death toll to 67 and 
the nimitz freeway toll to 42 the quake injured more than 2800 
people left more than 14000 homeless and caused an estimated 7 
billion in damage 
the 5foot10 220pound helm whom local radio stations had 
affectionately dubbed lucky buck was pulled from the most 
heavily damaged section of the collapsed freeway 
rescuers had given up hope of finding more survivors when an 
engineer inspecting the structures stability saw helm wave from 
inside his small car a large beam that fell in front of helms 
small car saved it from being flattened 
helm suffered a fractured skull three broken ribs nerve damage 
to his leg and kidney problems due to dehydration 
helm was a longshoremans clerk who worked the docks in oakland 
and commuted 250 miles on weekends to visit his family in 
weaverville after his rescue getwell messages were posted in 
shop windows outside the courthouse and on the marquee of a 
theater in the tiny town 
helms former wife lorrie helm said he seemed to understand 
what had happened to him and was able to communicate with people 
around him she said he had acknowledged hearing the contents of 
cards and letters from around the world that his family read to him 
his love for us and our love for him is one of the major 
things that kept him going mrs helm said at a news conference 
three days after his rescue 
helm was unable to talk because of the respirator tube we 
talk with our eyes with our hands and the love we feel for each 
other mrs helm said 
helm was transferred from highland general hospital to kaiser 
permanente on nov 2 because he was a member of the kaiser health 
maintenance organization his wife said at the time kaiser 
initially said helm was in serious but stable condition but three 
weeks ago his family told the hospital not to comment publicly on 
his recovery 
telephone calls to mrs helms home and to the familys lawyer 
bill choulos went unanswered sunday morning 
helms family has received dozens of movie offers for the story 
of helms survival but choulos said none was being seriously 
considered choulos had hired a beverly hills public relations firm 
to handle media and other inquiries 
there was no immediate word of memorial services helm is 
survived by his wife and at least four children

boeing co and machinists union leaders reached 
tentative agreement early sunday on a contract to end a 47dayold 
strike affecting more than 57000 workers in nine states 
federal mediator doug hammond said he recommended terms that 
eventually were accepted by both sides in a 14hour bargaining 
session that ended about 330 am pst 
union leaders were divided on the offer but the majority said 
they would recommend approval 
a ratification vote by members of the international association 
of machinists and aerospace workers was set for monday night 
terms of the threeyear contract proposal were withheld pending 
the vote 
at hammonds request negotiators from the company and the union 
returned to the bargaining table saturday the third such attempt 
to find agreement since the strike began oct 4 
the walkout is the longest for seattlebased boeing since 1948 
chief boeing negotiator larry mckean said strikers could be back 
on the job as early as wednesday morning adding that he was 
certainly elated to have a tentative agreement here 
tom baker president of machinists district lodge 751 in 
seattle which represents nearly fourfifths of the workers covered 
by the union and justin ostro an international vice president who 
coordinates aerospace industry negotiations for the union took 
opposite positions on the contract 
ostro said it failed to increase wage rates beyond what boeing 
had proposed since oct 2 two days before the strike began 
although it did boost production bonuses but baker called the 
settlement a substantial improvement over previous boeing 
offers 
ostro said the recommendation to accept came on a 32 vote of 
the union bargaining team on which he does not vote both sides 
will argue their cases before members cast their ballots on 
ratification he added 
baker said ratification was favored by negotiating team members 
representing 55000 of those covered by the union 
hammond said his decision to submit his own recommendation to 
the two sides for settlement was an unusual and for me a rare 
step that he has used only once before in his 15 years with the 
federal mediation and conciliation service 
boeings previous offer included wage increases of 4 percent the 
first year then 3 percent each of the other two years annual 
bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay the first year then 4 percent 
the other two years a reduction in mandatory overtime and 
acrosstheboard increases in retirement benefits 
the strike caused airlines in the midst of industrywide and 
highly competitive expansion to have trouble getting planes they 
have ordered boeing has delivered 22 planes since the strike 
began though it had hoped to deliver 94 in the last three months 
of 1989 
at least six of boeings major customers last week reported 
delays in receiving new planes and some said they had to alter 
plans for expanding or inaugurating service 
boeing spokesman paul binder would not comment last week on the 
delays he said only that production work was being done by 
supervisors and any machinists who have crossed picket lines 
boeing estimated 55 percent of seattlearea machinists and 40 
percent of those at its wichita kan plant have gone back to 
work union estimates were much lower 
machinists represent more than 57000 boeing workers including 
about 43000 in the seattle area 12000 in wichita 1700 in 
portland ore and a few hundred at sites in a halfdozen other 
states 
boeings longest strike was 140 days in 1948 by machinists a 
1977 machinists strike lasted 45 days

one of the last ramparts of communist 
control fell over the weekend with the first broadcast of a 
primetime news program controlled by the solidarityled government 
the news will be good and bad lets hope the latter will be 
few but it will always be true news announcer wojciech 
reszczynski declared during the saturday broadcast of the evening 
news 
the lead story was a report on president wojciech jaruzelskis 
meeting with relatives of officers killed at katyn in the soviet 
union during world war ii 
two years ago any discussion of the deaths of the 4300 
officers was taboo polish and western historians blame the soviets 
for the killings while moscow says the nazis were responsible 
the evening news even visited the censor who is less active 
under the new government but the censorship officials were not in 
their office and the porter refused to let the news crew into the 
building 
the communist party had dominated the mass media ever since 
world war ii and the evening news had been one of its main 
instruments of propaganda the old news and its announcers were 
despised by many poles especially since all male announcers wore 
uniforms during martial law imposed in 1981 
solidarity was crushed at that time and not legalized again 
until this year 
poles had expected change in the evening news ever since the 
solidarityled government was elected two months ago but the new 
cabinet approached reform of television with great caution 
the first visible change saturday was in the graphics 
introducing the show they included the v for victory sign 
associated with the solidarity labor movement since it was founded 
nine years ago 
the news presented a report on the financial situation of the 
gdansk shipyard the birthplace of solidarity followed by a long 
piece on solidarity union leader lech walesas trip through the 
united states 
the revamped evening news is the work of a group of people fired 
during the martial law crackdown and reinstated by andrzej drawicz 
the new head of the powerful radio and television committee 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the only noncommunist leader 
in the east bloc who took office aug 24 appointed drawicz to head 
the committee in september 
the veteran solidarity activist immediately appealed to former 
radio and television employees who had lost their jobs for 
political reasons to resume work hundreds answered his call 
drawicz said employees of the old committee would not be 
dismissed but that they would no longer appear on the air 
some viewers were delighted to see the face of bohdan 
tomaszewski a favorite sports commentator who refused to appear on 
television after martial law he later worked for underground radio 
solidarity 
a hotline was set up for viewers to phone in their impressions 
the news later reported that the phones had been ringing 
constantly and generally people liked the changes it said there 
were only two calls demanding a return to the old news

five years after urging malaysians 
to have more babies prime minister mahathir mohamad says the 
countrys high birthrate now endangers its standard of living 
malaysia with a population of 17 million must reduce its 
birthrate or the government could be overwhelmed by economic 
demands from a burgeoning population mahathir said 
his remarks were made friday at the opening of a united malay 
national organization meeting the group is the dominant political 
party in the governing national front coalition 
based on 1985 statistics mahathir said the population was 
increasing by 340000 a year or more than a million every three 
years 
the current birthrate of 2 percent to 3 percent could require 
heavy government spending the creation of many more jobs and lead 
to a decline in living standards in the not too distant future 
mahathirs comments indicated the official policy of encouraging 
a baby boom would be reversed but official sources could not 
confirm this sunday 
he suggested in 1982 that malaysia create its own market for 
manufactured goods by increasing its population of 14 million at 
that time by 400 percent to 70 million people mahathir said he 
would like to see his country emulate japan a highdensity nation 
with a domestic market capable of sustaining its economy 
his advocacy of rapid population growth which became national 
policy in 1984 have stirred controversy 
the world bank and other international agencies said malaysia 
should limit population growth to spur economic expansion and 
improve living conditions 
the government deemphasized family planning programs and 
enacted laws encouraging larger families maternity leave and other 
benefits were extended for working mothers up to their fifth child 
mahathir himself the father of five said at the time im 
not saying well achieve the target overnight but this is the 
first step 
it proved to be a giant step the original population goal was 
70 million by the year 2100 mahathir said friday that with the 
present rate of growth there could be that many in 2030 or 70 
years earlier 
nevertheless malaysia is still one of the least densely

a third former policeman has 
confessed to involvement in a police death squad that assassinated 
government opponents a newspaper reported sunday 
the sunday times south africas largestcirculation newspaper 
identified the third man as david tshikalange and said he has fled 
the country after telling a journalist he was a member of a death 
squad reportedly headed by former police capt dirk coetzee 
coetzee who also has fled south africa said in a newspaper 
interview published friday that he commanded a death squad and 
arranged political assassinations with the approval of senior 
police commanders 
coetzee gave the interview after being implicated last month in 
an affidavit by a former policeman butana nofomela 
nofomela was spared from death row where he faced hanging for 
a nonpolitical murder after giving information about the 
unsolved killings of several activists he said he participated in 
a death squad that was commanded by coetzee who is white and 
which included tshikalange a black 
the allegations are under investigation but police officials 
have denied the existence of any death sqaud and described coetzee 
as an unstable embittered man who had faced disciplinary action 
this attempt to discredit coetzee even before his charges are 
investigated has been depicted by antiapartheid groups as part of 
a broader coverup effort 
lawyers for human rights the organization that obtained 
nofomelas affidavit is now seeking assurances from the justice 
ministry that the prisoner will not be executed until all the death 
squad allegations are resolved 
coetzee reportedly has fled to london but his wife karin 
coetzee said in interviews published sunday that he confided in 
her before he left 
every word is true she told the sunday star my husband 
told me he needed to clear his name and he wanted to tell the whole 
world he said he wanted to be able to live with himself and to 
have a good conscience 
she said he decided a week ago to flee south africa for fear he 
would be killed or made a scapegoat for killings authorized by his 
superiors 
one of the activists allegedly killed by the death squad was 
griffiths mxenge a black human rights lawyer 
bhgeke shezi who was mxenges law partner said the official 
investigation of the allegations appeared inadequate 
although coetzee was named by nofomela as head of the hit 
squad the investigators did not interview him before his sudden 
departure shezi said there are many other relevant people who 
have been ignored 
opposition leaders said coetzees allegations substantiated 
their longstanding suspicions that police were behind dozens of 
unsolved killings of activists 
coetzee said death squads were formed in 1980 and based at a 
farm near pretoria where former guerrillas were housed after their 
capture and placed in a counterterrorist unit he corroborated 
nofomelas story that a police unit killed mxenge mutilating his 
body and trying to make it look like a robbery

nigeria which has not conducted a 
nationwide census since 1960 will count its burgeoning population 
in 1991 a report said sunday 
the census will determine whether africas most populous nation 
has grown to 100 million people as estimates say and whether it 
is likely to become the worlds third most populous country by the 
middle of the next century as some predict 
the census will be politically sensitive because regional and 
ethnic groups reportedly inflate their numbers to gain power in the 
national government 
shehu musa the chairman of the national population commission 
said the census will be conducted in october 1991 the news agency 
of nigeria reported 
musa said a trial census will be conducted in november 1990 to 
assess the commissions ability to make a fair count the country 
will be divided into 10000 areas for the purposes of the counting

china on sunday expressed its utmost 
indignation over wideranging us sanctions against china for 
its crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators last spring 
vice foreign minister liu huaqiu lodged a strongly worded 
protest with us ambassador james lilley over the bill which 
congress has sent to president bush for signing a us diplomat 
said 
liu who is responsible for north american affairs told lilley 
that china regards the bill as interference in its internal affairs 
and hopes the us government will take action to stop it said 
the diplomat who declined to be further identified 
the bill was drafted to protest the chinese armys violent 
attack on the unarmed protesters june 34 it crushed a movement 
that had demanded democratic educational and other social reforms 
the chinese government called the demonstrations 
counterrevolutionary turmoil instigated with help from 
overseas it said they sought to overthrow chinas communist regime 
since the chinese government put down the counterrevolutionary 
rebellion in accordance with the chinese constitution and laws 
the us congress has meddled in chinas internal affairs and 
stirred up an antichina wave by adopting one resolution after 
another on this matter which is purely the internal affairs of 
china liu was quoted as saying by staterun television and the 
xinhua news agency 
the us congress still goes ahead with the adoption of a 
resolution against china basing itself on false reports and 
rumors and thus gravely damaging the sinous relations and 
hurting the national feelings of the chinese people liu was 
quoted as saying 
the bill which bush could veto imposes two years of trade 
sanctions including suspension of trade assistance halts risk 
insurance for american firms doing business in china and freezes 
exports of satellites controlled munitions such as helicopters and 
certain nuclear material and components 
the bill condemns what it calls the unprovoked brutal and 
indiscriminate assault on the protesters and unarmed civilians 
which it said left 700 dead 
china has said some 300 people died but western intelligence 
estimates put the number as high as 3000 
in dhaka bangladesh chinese premier li peng said sunday that 
western trade sanctions against china because of its crackdown on 
dissent would backfire and hurt the countries imposing the 
restrictions 
these sanctions are causing considerable strains on the 
development process li said western investment is not only 
beneficial to china but also to those who have invested

mathias rothe a teacher says he 
is among progressive communist academics who long called for the 
reform forced on his discredited party by a popular revolt 
but many noncommunists in this rundown southern industrial 
city the countrys secondlargest where some of the first massive 
protests began in october are skeptical the party is genuinely 
willing to revamp the political system 
rothe 42 a party member since 1965 who taught basic 
marxismleninism to music students at leipzig conservatory says 
that to him and his progressive colleagues its satisfying for 
us that what we indicated should happen for years is now taking 
place 
no musician however great a virtuoso could graduate without 
the course that has now disappeared as a requirement since the 
revolt prompted sweeping changes in every area of east german life 
rothe now teaches general political economy 
at the conservatory and in other leipzig institutes the 
students have voted to disband the communist youth movement free 
german youth in favor of genuinely democratic student councils 
new forum east germanys largest opposition group condemned by 
the communists just a month ago is making the kind of demands 
which should have come from us rothe said in an interview in his 
office 
and internally they did come but not from the party as a 
whole 
during an hourlong conversation a visibly nervous rothe cited 
several incidents when he spoke his mind only to find some comrades 
supported him and people at the top did not 
in other east european countries such divided opinions within 
the party became evident in the governmentrun media or in the 
public speeches of various communist leaders 
in east germany home of prussian order a stalinist 
interpretation of party discipline kept differences behind closed 
doors rothe said 
the governments refusal for years to institute sovietstyle 
reform was a disaster a catastrophe he said 
like many other communists he has no thought of quitting the 
party that has given him power and a creed but he is bitter about 
the past 
i dont know if one should put erich honecker a man who is 
nearly 80 on trial although his guilt is immeasurable rothe 
said of the former party leader who was ousted oct 18 
but guether mittag belongs in court without question he 
said referring to the former politburo member who was responsible 
for the economy 
in the eyes of nonparty members any of the approximately 2 
million communists can be held to account for the woeful state of 
the economy the bureaucratic meddling and regimentation of every 
aspect of daily life in the past 
the new leadership under egon krenz who replaced honecker as 
president and party chief has promised reform eased foreign 
travel restrictions and punched holes in the berlin wall 
but skeptical demonstrators chanting opportunist 
opportunist have prevented any communist officials however 
reformist from addressing the weekly prodemocracy demonstrations 
in leipzig a city of 550000 
i turn around to a man who was booing behind me and try to 
explain that there are also good people in the party rothe said 
but the mood of the masses is against the party at the moment 
which makes it inevitable that the first reaction is a chorus of 
whistles 
rothe and other communists see hope in the reforms and say they 
are genuinely prepared to stand in free elections 
much of the population and even some communists appear 
unconvinced 
according to politburo member guenther schabowski 66000 
comrades have handed in their party cards this year and 
resignations continue 
kai hannig 23 a new forum organizer at leipzig brewery says 
workers are also quitting the official trade unions as in the 
institutes factory branches of the free german youth are being 
dissolved while new forum has built up groups in at least 25 city 
factories in just four weeks 
the communist party remains of course an immensely powerful 
body with resources far beyond those of any group in east germany 
but as falk hocquel another new forum activist noted none 
of the minor party officials has a tape recorder or access to a 
computer to organize at the grassroots level as we are beginning to 
do 
hocquel recently attended a conservatory discussion sharing the 
platform with rothe and others 
the devil lies in the details he recalled of rothes 
contribution it all sounds fine in general but when you get 
down to precise questions like the communist partys claim to 
power theres no basic change

prosecutors regularly leave government service 
to defend the kind of people they once tried to put in jail but 
some say the case of michael abbell is special 
abbell left the justice department in 1984 after 17 years 
during which he rose to head the criminal division office that 
handled extraditions from foreign countries now he represents 
some of the very people the united states wants most to extradite 
alleged cocaine kingpins from colombia 
he also has urged congress to amend mutual legal assistance 
treaties with foreign nations to give defendants in international 
cases the same rights as prosecutors in obtaining evidence from 
overseas and he helped craft a policy resolution on that issue 
that was approved in august by the american bar association 
sen john kerry dmass chairman of the senate narcotics and 
terrorism subcommittee criticizes abbells switch to the other 
side 
i personally find quite troubling the decision of a former 
highlevel justice department official like mr abbell to provide 
expertise to major cocaine traffickers that he gained while he was 
working for the united states justice department and privy to the 
innermost workings of our criminal justice system kerry wrote 
recently to the national association of criminal defense lawyers 
but abbell contends and legal ethics experts agree that 
prosecutors switch sides all the time and there is nothing wrong 
with it 
i obtained written conflictofinterest clearance from the 
department of justice even though it was not necessary in an 
excess of caution he said he obtained that clearance prior to 
appearing in a spanish court in 1985 as an expert witness on us 
grand jury practices in a case involving alleged cali cocaine 
cartel kingpin gilberto rodriguez orejuela and alleged medellin 
cocaine cartel leader jorge ochoa 
department spokesman dan eramian confirmed that abbell received 
conflictofinterest clearance 
more recently abbell said he has traveled several times to 
cali to meet with rodriguez and his associates to advise them on 
how to avoid us extradition requests rodriguez and other alleged 
cali cartel leaders are on a justice department list of 12 most 
wanted drug fugitives 
abbell interviewed by telephone acknowledged that the 
extradition treaty with colombia was negotiated when i headed the 
justice department office but he stressed hes not scrounging 
for a loophole in his representation of colombian clients he said 
he is arguing that treaty was held to be not enforceable by the 
colombian supreme court because it was not properly ratified in 
colombia 
the treaty was reinstated under emergency measures aug 18 by 
president virgilio barco 
abbell said he left his law firm after a washington post story 
last month about his new clientele but added these people are 
by no means my only clients a good part of the work i do is in the 
white collar area 
abbell said he left the justice department because of the 
relatively low pay and because a political appointee was moved 
down on my shoulders 
very few prosecutors stay on for their whole lives and most of 
them get involved in defending cases he said you go to 
any district in which there are drug defendants and you will find 
former prosecutors defending them 
aba officials scrutinized abbells work on the aba resolution in 
the wake of the publicity about his clients said james r 
silkenat who chairs the associations international law section 
silkenat said he found abbell did not initiate the action 
the people involved knew of abbells clientele and his work was 
well apart from any private work he might have been doing 
there didnt seem to be any particularly pernicious acts by him 
that anybody could complain about 
stephen gillers new york university legal ethics professor 
said he found no legal or ethical problems with abbells 
sideswitching since abbell developed the extradition treaty with 
colombia he cannot argue the treaty is unconstitutional under us 
law but arguing that the colombian supreme courts action makes it 
inoperable is absolutely valid gillers said

samuel skinner transportation secretary by 
trade is getting a reputation as the bush administrations 
master of disaster the mr fixit for domestic crises 
when san francisco was jolted by a major earthquake oct 17 
president bush immediately assigned his transportation secretary to 
coordinate federal relief efforts 
it was not the first time bush turned to his transportation 
secretary in a time of crisis skinner is bushs point man for 
dealing with the environmental devastation from the exxon valdez 
oil spill off the coast of alaska and the continuing strike by 
eastern airlines pilots he was the first high federal official to 
survey the damage from hurricane hugo 
while there is a transportation thread in each of these issues 
bush has expanded skinners role to areas covered by other cabinet 
secretaries or agency heads 
skinner was in san francisco again last week walking the 
damaged bay bridge before that he surveyed charleston sc 
checking damage from hurricane hugo he also is planning another 
trip to the alaska oil spill site 
sam has more or less assumed the role of a domestic crisis 
management team without portfolio said gop consultant peter 
teeley equating skinners role with one he said bush played on 
foreign policy matters in the reagan administration 
hes the one person bush continues to look to when these 
things arise teeley said 
skinners staff has nicknamed him the master of disaster 
erecting a small mock shrine with plants candles and his 
photograph while he was on his first trip to california after the 
loma prieta quake 
the raspyvoiced former chicago prosecutor and mass transit 
administrator has a less lofty definition of his role in such 
crises as the earthquake 
im available to cut through any paperwork bureaucracy and 
red tape if necessary he said in an interview 
skinner a 51yearold certified pilot has not escaped 
criticism in his role as secretary of a department with 102000 
employees and a nearly 25 billion budget to oversee airways 
waterways highways railroads and pipelines 
he first stepped into controversy when he announced the 
administrations refusal to intervene in the strike against eastern 
airlines labor unions accused him and bush of playing into the 
hands of texas air corp owner frank lorenzo whom they accuse of 
trying to bust the union and sell off the airline 
skinner forced alterations in the stock buyout of northwest 
airlines a move that analysts say was partly to blame for the 
collapse of plans by united airlines employees and management to 
take over parent company ual inc 
the collapse of the ual deal in turn is widely blamed for 
triggering the oct 13 sharp drop in the stock market 
he probably has primary responsibility for failure of the ual 
deal said transportation expert james gattuso of the heritage 
foundation a conservative think tank 
skinner disclaimed any role in the stock market decline saying 
the united deal failed for one reason and one reason only it 
was not sound financially 
the march 24 exxon valdez spill of 10 million gallons of crude 
oil into alaskas prince william sound put skinner at odds with 
some environmentalists who claim the companys cleanup has been 
inadequate 
skinner said he is satisfied with exxons effort which has cost 
the company hundreds of millions of dollars 
his department also has been the focus of controversy and court 
tests over mandatory random drug testing of employees in 
safetyrelated jobs the new rules go into effect next month 
skinner also has announced he is considering expanding the rules 
to check for alcohol abuse in air sea and rail transportation 
industries 
i dont want to mislead that im some kind of prude skinner 
said i occasionally have a drink but alcoholism is a major 
problem in this country 
in dealing with air terrorism skinner has expanded his role to 
that of a diplomat traveling to canada and europe for meetings 
with other transport officials after the dec 21 bombing of pan am 
flight 103 over scotland that killed 270 people 
the air transport association representing airlines said 
skinner moved too quickly in ordering them to pay for and install 
antiterrorist devices that might not do the job 
but association president robert j aaronson praises skinner for 
his openness 
i dont think theres ever been a secretary who was more 
available for a meeting with a senior person from the industry 
he said 
with all the issues skinner has handled in 10 months he puts 
one as his highest priority plans to set a national transportation 
policy after a series of nationwide public meetings 
sen brock adams dwash who ran transportation in the carter 
administration said this is not a new approach 
every transportation secretary has tried it and it always 
ends with the staff writing up huge volumes of material and you 
always come out in the same place adams said 
skinner sees it differently 
i dont think anybody has looked as strategically as 
encompassing and as intermodal as we have he said i think it 
will make a difference

the king of south africas zulus 
complained to a crowd of 70000 sunday that he should have been 
invited to a welcoming rally for freed leaders of the outlawed 
african national congress 
king goodwill zwelithini spoke at a special convention of his 
people held at a durban sports stadium three weeks after a crowd 
of similar size welcomed the anc leaders at a mass rally outside 
johannesburg 
both king goodwill and mangosuthu buthelezi chief minister of 
the zulu homeland have been at odds with the anc over the years 
opposing the movements use of guerrilla violence against the 
whitecontrolled national government 
king goodwill suggested the anc might seek to exclude moderate 
zulu leaders from a role in negotiations to end whiteminority 
domination i make the great plea that we are allowed to play our 
zulu role in everything that is being done the king said let 
us now put black divisiveness aside 
seven senior anc leaders were freed from prison oct 15 and 
honored two weeks later at a mass rally 
king goodwill complained that the anc leaders expressed no 
appreciation for buthelezis past appeals for the release of 
political prisoners 
and i as king of the zulus received not one single message 
about the welcoming rally king goodwill said 
members of buthelezis inkatha movement have been engaged in a 
bloody power struggle over the three years in natal province with 
supporters of antiapartheid groups aligned with the anc more than 
2000 people have been killed 
an estimated 7 million of south africas 28 million blacks are 
zulus although many do not share the political views of king 
goodwill or buthelezi

even scrooge on his worst bahhumbug 
days might have shed a tear at the sight 
what appears at first glance to be a jolly santas workshop in 
this washington suburb is actually a torture chamber for christmas 
toys that is worthy of the spanish inquisition 
working behind closed doors in a small room stacked high with 
yuletide goodies bob hundemer the torquemada of the toy business 
is gleefully wrenching the nose off a cuddly teddy bear 
nearby a bespectacled helper is calmly dismembering a stack of 
dolls with blonde tresses yanking off their arms without a trace 
of emotion at his elbow are the shattered remains of dump trucks 
airplanes and baby rattles and bits of stuffing from disemboweled 
toy animals 
they are working in the toy testing laboratory of the us 
consumer product safety commission and their tables are crowded 
with diabolical devices specifically designed to fold spindle and 
mutilate or worse 
clamps and torque wrenches are applied to the eyes of lovable 
toy monkeys teething rings are dropped in pots of boiling water 
stuffed bears are battered with fingerlike probes 
is this guy the grinch who stole christmas or what 
no i feel more like the good witch of the north says 
hundemer chief of the twoman laboratory which is housed in the 
drab former barracks of an abandoned nike missile site about 15 
miles northwest of washington 
with extra help to cope with the christmas rush hundemer and 
his assistant garfield jenkins work full time testing about 900 
toys annually for potential safety hazards to children 
hundemer estimates that more than twothirds many of them 
massproduced imports from mexico or the far east flunk the 
commissions stringent standards they are either recalled for 
redesigning or banned from the market as unfit for putting under 
the christmas tree 
last year 245 toys were voluntarily recalled by manufacturers 
at the agencys urging some of the worst offenders will be 
displayed at a dec 1 news conference when the commission will 
give its annual christmas warning to toybuying parents 
by far the biggest threat posed by hazardous toys which 
accounted for 142000 injuries and a minimum of 22 deaths last 
year are small parts that children can easily detach with their 
teeth or fingers and put in their mouths causing choking or 
asphyxiation 
most choking deaths involve balloons marbles and other small 
balls says john e preston a mechanical engineer who designed 
many of the agencys toytesting procedures but balloons and 
marbles are exempt from government safety regulations because of 
their universal popularity as childrens playthings 
can we tolerate the 10 deaths of children every year from 
choking on balloons preston asked on the other hand we dont 
believe the world is ready to accept a ban on balloons and marbles 
were perplexed about what we can do 
hundemer says he has compelling reasons for his personal 
interest in toy safety as the parent of two small children 
the government cant begin to test all the 150000 different 
toys on the market he said so dont depend on the government to 
provide you with complete safety parents must play an active 
role in monitoring toy safety 
look for durability and quality of construction he says and 
select toys suitable for a childs age and skills avoid buying 
toys with small parts or long cords for infants or toddlers 
be particularly cautious about small balls and toys that shoot 
projectiles or contain electrical heating elements consult label 
precautions and follow instructions supervise children at play 
and repair or discard damaged toys immediately 
dont be fooled when a clerk says we couldnt sell it if it 
werent safe hundemer said thats not true and people who 
believe that are misguided

two former staff members say in a book that 
united press international has ceased to exist as a competitive 
news agency a victim of a succession of misguided managements and 
of changes in the industry 
there was no single reason for upis plunge from robust 
competitor to cowering dwarf say authors gregory gordon and 
ronald e cohen in their account of the difficulties of the 
82yearold agency once a feisty underdog competitor to the 
bigger older associated press 
but if the wire service indeed had any chances against these 
outside forces the authors write they were squandered 
repeatedly by owners and managers either inept illsuited or 
unwilling to rise to the challenge 
gordon a former investigative reporter for upi is now with the 
detroit news cohen former upi managing editor is now executive 
editor of the gannett news service 
upi currently owned by infotechnology inc parent firm to a 
number of hightech ventures continues to cover the news and sell 
its report to media subscribers 
but in down to the wire gordon and cohen portray the 
company as mortally wounded from internal battles and no longer a 
major player in the news industry 
they say upi is staggering under the burdens of decades of 
management stupidity and cupidity of neglect low pay miserable 
working conditions of astonishing lapses in leadership and 
foresight of a succession of owners who had exploited unipressers 
love of company and professional pride 
they estimate that the company lost 135 million in the last 25 
years in attempts under four ownerships to regain solvency 
upis current management disputes the authors depiction of upi 
as reduced to a gaunt shadow of its heyday 
upi is in the fullest sense a competitor in the industry 
said spokesman milt capps unfortunately the authors essentially 
stopped their learning and reporting when infotechnology took 
over he said 
they chose to mark their own departures from upi as the point 
at which upi ceased to exist as a news agency capps said 
nothing could be further from the truth 
he said upi has a staff of nearly 800 reporters and editors 
and more than 4000 other correspondents around the world has 
more than 3000 clients expects to make a modest profit in the 
fourth quarter of 1989 and in 1990 draws 4 percent of its revenues 
from government and corporate clients and projects that nonmedia 
clients will contribute 20 to 25 percent of its business base 
within five years the turnaround has been dramatic he said 
gordon and cohen say a blow to the companys chances of ever 
regaining its old stature as aps chief rival occurred when upis 
current top executives chairman earl brian and president paul 
steinle opted to unbundle to offer to sell the wire 
services news sports and photo reports separately instead of as a 
package 
that decision a gamble rejected by previous owners allowed the 
relatively few big city newspapers which still paid thousands of 
dollars a month to cut back in what they got from upi and what they 
paid to it 
as a result newspapers in places like boston and seattle so 
curtailed their service that upi stories became a rarity the 
book says 
but well before brian and steinle took over upi had become 
competitively weak the authors say 
in 1982 an e w scripps co family trust sold upi for 1 after 
absorbing losses that amounted to 80 million over 20 years at the 
time they say the company had more than 4000 broadcasting 
subscribers and 800 newspaper clients 
by last summer they say there were half as many broadcaster 
subscribers and fewer than 200 daily papers the great majority 
small singleservice clients paying low rates 
a worldwide staff that had numbered 1737 in 1982 was diminished 
to 650 they write and at times ap had as many people in topeka 
covering the kansas legislature as upi had covering congress 
the authors list five factors aside from internal struggles and 
shortages of capital which wrought immeasurable damage 
among them is the structural differences between upi a private 
concern that sold its news report to newspapers and broadcasters 
and ap a news cooperative owned by the newspapers and broadcasters 
which receive its report 
ap they write was part of the chummy establishment that kept 
its scruffy competitor rapping in vain on the country club 
window as a result from the start upi was an underdog and 
the game was unfair perhaps unwinnable 
another factor they say was the 1945 supreme court antitrust 
decision which required ap to provide its services broadly instead 
of to only one member per city the consequence was to make upi 
divert dwindling resources into expensive coverage of state and 
regional news a losing proposition 
other causes were the demise of most largecity afternoon 
papers eager to receive latebreaking news from whichever agency 
could deliver it first and the trend which saw national news media 
organizations taking over the ownership of many familyowned 
newspapers with the new owners less interested in supporting a 
second wire service than amassing enormous profits for 
stockholders 
finally the book says a number of newspapers and news 
organizations began to offer first rate supplemental news 
services at far cheaper rates than those charged by upi in 
truth the very clients upi needed to stay alive were competitors 
for shrinking industry dollars and stood to benefit from the wire 
services demise 
upi was organized as united press in 1907 by e w scripps 
founder of the countrys first big newspaper group scrippshoward 
newspapers 
the scripps empire was strong in the midwest and the pacific 
coast and consisted chiefly of papers published in the afternoon 
scripps felt the ap was easternoriented and dominated by morning 
newspapers 
in 1958 up merged with a weaker competitor the hearst corps 
international news service to form upi 
in 1981 tired of absorbing losses scripps looked for a buyer 
and finally arranged a sale in 1982 to two tennesseans donald ruhe 
and william e geissler 
they sold off some of its profitable operations including its 
overseas photo operation and couldnt make a go of it with what 
was left filing for chapter 11 protection under the bankruptcy 
laws the court approved the companys sale to mario vazquezrana 
a wealthy mexican newspaper publisher 
gordon and cohen estimate that vazquezrana lost 70 million 
before allowing the company to come under the control of 
infotechnology 
gordon an 18year upi veteran was fired by upi in may when he 
refused to submit his manuscript to his employer for review upi 
said at the time that writing a book derogatory of upi would 
violate the companys contract with the wire service guild cohen 
a 25year veteran was fired in 1986 during a reorganization under 
vazquezrana 
capps said of both the circumstances under which they left 
had to do with things quite apart from their intention to write 
this book although he said gordons refusal to submit the 
manuscript for review was a material factor

claimed responsibility sunday for bombs that killed three british 
soldiers on patrol in northern ireland and injured an army sergeant 
and his wife in england

planted the bomb defused nov 13 outside the london home of a 
senior army general

renewed his warning to members of the public to be extra vigilant 
and alert 
george churchillcoleman head of scotland yards antiterrorist 
squad urged public figures last week to take extra security 
measures 
in its statement to the news media the ira said 
clearly the ira cannot be beaten the british public instead 
of fruitlessly condemning the ira should be taking to the streets 
and demanding the end of martial rule in northern ireland 
the ira has targeted army installations in england and 
continental europe as well as northern ireland in its bloody 
campaign to drive the british out of the predominantly protestant 
province and unite it with the roman catholic republic of ireland 
the ministry of defense said staff sgt andrew mudd and his wife 
were driving out of the married quarters at the british army 
headquarters for eastern england in colchester 50 miles northeast 
of london when their car exploded saturday people reportedly 
heard the bomb one mile away

and bruises he said 
deputy chief constable peter simpson of essex police said his 
force was searching for men seen near the barracks shortly after 
the explosion 
the army identified the three paratroopers killed hours later in 
a roadside blast near the border town of newry county down as 
lance cpl stephen wilson 23 pvt donald macaulay 20 and pvt 
matthew marshall 21 
a fourth soldier who was in the armored landrover hurled off 
the road by the bomb was very seriously ill with multiple 
injuries an army spokesman said the soldiers name was not 
released 
the royal ulster constabulary said the bomb hidden in a 
roadside wall was probably detonated by remote control bomb and 
forensic experts using metal detectors and helicopters with 
infrared equipment searched the area make sure there were no other 
bombs 
men in a second landrover following a short distance behind 
escaped injury and were able to call for help 
scotland had said the bomb found last week outside the london 
home of lt gen david ramsbotham commander of the british field 
army and inspector general of the reserve army bore all the 
hallmarks of the ira 
commander churchillcoleman said the bomb was placed under a 
neighbors parked car and when it fell off was spotted by someone 
nearby police evacuated the area of fashionable kensington while 
the bomb was defused 
the soldiers deaths raised to 10 the number of regular army 
soldiers killed in northern ireland this year 
since the provinces sectarian fighting began in 1969 266 
police 601 army personnel and 1902 civilians have been killed

step by step senate banking committee 
chairman donald riegle is acknowledging more and more involvement 
in the controversy swirling around the nations costliest savings 
and loan failure 
riegle a thirdterm democrat from michigan refuses to answer 
reporters questions about his meeting with federal regulators who 
were examining lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif 
but he is among five senators who received large contributions 
from charles h keating jr chairman of lincolns holding company 
at a time keating was pushing for more lenient regulation 
the five senators met with regulators who were examining the 
sampls shaky investments in april 1987 but all deny any attempt to 
sway the results of the investigation 
keating who is scheduled to testify before a house panel 
tuesday has said he certainly meant to be buying influence when he 
made campaign contributions to the five senators 
lincolns collapse is expected to cost taxpayers between 15 
billion and 2 billion 
riegles most complete public disclosure was an oct 18 written 
response to a senate ethics committee query in which he wrote 
at no time did i ever initiate any contact with the regulators 
concerning lincoln he said it is my belief that my actions 
with respect to this matter were entirely proper at all times 
riegle asserted his only involvement was attending an april 9 
1987 meeting with the four other senators and the regulators 
but in response to testimony before the house banking committee 
riegle and his staff have added several details 
although riegle says he doesnt remember it aide david krawitz 
says office records show the senator met feb 26 1987 with jack 
d atchison lincolns outside auditor 
riegle acknowledges discussing the lincoln situation march 6 
1987 with edwin gray then chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board in congressional testimony gray said those talks led to the 
two meetings in april 1987 between senators and federal regulators 
that are a focal point of the controversy 
and last week riegles staff confirmed a report first published 
in the trade publication american banker that in march 1987 he took 
a helicopter tour of the arizona real estate holdings of lincolns 
parent company american continental corp including a lavish 
resort 
gray met april 2 1987 with sens dennis deconcini dariz 
john mccain rariz alan cranston dcalif and john glenn 
dohio riegle didnt attend but he joined the other senators at 
an april 9 meeting with bank board examiners to discuss lincoln 
some witnesses at house banking committee hearings have partly 
blamed riegle and the other four senators for delaying the federal 
takeover of lincoln until this past april and thus making it more 
costly 
riegle decided to expend his political capital and time on 
behalf of the savings and loan perpetrators instead of encouraging 
the formation of victims groups to get their money back and 
helping to reform the system consumer advocate ralph nader said 
riegle last was reelected in 1988 he received 76100 in 
campaign contributions from keating and his associates 
most of the donations were given at a march 23 1987 
fundraiser at the pontchartrain hotel in downtown detroit which 
keating had purchased and renovated riegle returned the money a 
year later 
whatever the outcome of probes by the ethics panel and the house 
banking committee the political jeopardy for riegle is obvious 
former rep jim dunn defeated by riegle in a 1988 landslide 
raised the issue of the lincoln sampl during the campaign although 
it did him little apparent good 
riegles term doesnt expire until 1994 and republicans have 
said little about the controversy this year but michigan gop 
chairman spencer abraham said friday that riegle should step aside 
as banking committee chairman until the probe is finished 
if he does not make a full disclosure to the people of this 
state i think i would want to reexamine whether he is fit to 
serve as our senator abraham said

israeli soldiers in the gaza strip arrested a 
palestinian informer sunday and accused him of being the tel aviv 
strangler who killed four jews and three israeli arabs in one 
the countrys worst murder cases 
its certain i killed them mohammed halabi shouted at 
reporters as police led him in handcuffs into tel avivs police 
station why i am now religious there were some among them 
who were collaborators and others among them who were prostitutes 
more than 147 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs for 
allegedly collaborating with israel or engaging in prostitution 
during the 23monthold palestinian uprising against israeli rule 
of the west bank and gaza strip but israel radio said police 
believe halabi killed the five women and two men as the result of a 
dispute 
newspapers have reported that the 32yearold suspect began 
informing for the shin bet secret service in 1985 after he was 
released six years early from an 11year jail sentence for drug 
trafficking and prostitution 
the independent yediot ahronot daily has said underground 
palestinian popular committees sentenced him to death for 
collaboration after reports were published of his cooperation with 
the shin bet the agency responsible for internal security in 
israel 
tel aviv police chief avi dotan said on israel radio there was 
an unambiguous link between halabi and the seven victims who 
were strangled with nylon rope their bodies were found oct 20 in 
two apartments in tel aviv and neighboring jaffa 
halabi surrendered without a struggle after troops and security 
agents kicked in the door of a shack where he was sleeping in the 
gaza strip town of khan yunis police officials said 
i thank hamas for making me a good and religious man who 
believes in god halabi said at the police station his remarks 
were carried on israel radio 
hamas arabic for zeal is a moslem fundamentalist group 
that has been at the forefront of the palestinian uprising 
tel aviv police spokeswoman dalia gilad reached by telephone 
said police were checking whether halabi was linked to hamas or 
used the name for convenience 
she also confirmed that halabi of the jebaliya refugee camp in 
gaza worked in the past for shin bet 
it was unclear from newspaper reports what information halebi 
provided shin bet and whether he had informed on gaza strip 
uprising activists 
there have been repeated allegations shin bet uses petty 
criminals as informers in the occupied territories the stranglings 
sparked outrage in israel and led several rightwing politicians to 
demand tighter restrictions on the entry of palestinians into 
israel 
gaza arabs are banned from staying overnight in israel and must 
have a magnetic card issued by the military administration to pass 
through army checkpoints and enter israel those cards are only 
granted to arabs who pass security checks and have paid taxes

leaders of the 12 european community nations have 
begun to lay the basis for a new relationship with east european 
nations in the midst of political and economic reforms 
but in doing so they have made clear this is no time for 
western europe to forsake either the nato military alliance or the 
further integration of the ec economies 
at a summit dinner saturday given by president francois 
mitterrand the 12 western leaders agreed to consider forming a 
development bank for eastern europe and to help train managers in 
the newly emerging democracies 
the ec wants to increase its encouragement to the reform 
movements everywhere in europe which will accelerate the decline 
of totalitarianism mitterrand said 
he called the summit so europeans could assess the rapid events 
in eastern europe before the dec 23 meeting off malta between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
both british prime minister margaret thatcher and west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher are to meet separately with 
bush this week mitterrand is expected to see bush sometime next 
month 
we declare ourselves ready to cooperate in anything that will 
help the reform of the eastern countries which are going through a 
sometimes dramatic economic crisis the french leader said 
saturday night 
we are ready to contribute with all our means to this 
restoration to this installation of a healthy economy at the 
price of course of a verified return to democracy 
the ec leaders pledged more aid to poland and hungary until the 
two countries work out financial packages with the international 
monetary fund 
we feel we must give more aid said mrs thatcher they 
have to get through the winter 
since september the soviet blocs first noncommunist 
government has come to power in poland hungary has begun moves 
toward a democracy and east germanys hardline leader erich 
honecker has been replaced by reformminded egon krenz 
the krenz government opened the countrys borders nov 9 and 
began knocking holes in the berlin wall the following day leading 
to speculation of reunification of the two german republics 
that has sparked fears that west germany the most powerful 
economy in the ec might lessen its commitment to the community in 
favor of closer ties with east germany 
at the summit west german chancellor helmut kohl went out of 
his way to allay those fears 
i clearly told my colleagues that there is no alternative 
to ec membership kohl told reporters he who says anything 
different of german policy does not tell the truth 
mrs thatcher without referring directly to germany said 
the question of borders is not on the agenda they should stay as 
they are 
she added it was imperative not to weaken the security role of 
the north atlantic treaty organization 
at a time of great change its necessary to keep the 
background of stability and security she told a postsummit news 
conference we are all aware that the unification of the ec 
now has priority more than ever 
tying the economies of the 12 ec nations closer together centers 
on a plan to forge a monetary union by the mid1990s including the 
creation of a central banking system and eventually a single ec 
currency mrs thatcher opposes the plan fearing it would put too 
much power in the hands of a central european bank 
mitterrand is keen on settling the issue at a dec 89 ec summit 
meeting in strasbourg france 
the ec includes the european economic community also known as 
the common market the european atomic energy commission and the 
european coal and steel community its members are belgium 
britain denmark france germany greece ireland italy 
luxembourg the netherlands portugal and spain

congress is likely to impose conditions on 
further us aid to el salvador if the embattled central american 
countrys president alfredo cristiani fails to demonstrate by 
january that he is firmly in control sen christopher j dodd said 
sunday 
the connecticut democrat who is chairman of the senate foreign 
relations subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs said on nbcs 
meet the press that he doesnt favor any immediate move to cut 
back aid in the wake of last weeks slayings of six jesuit priests 
in el salvador 
i see no action being taken over the next several days prior 
to adjournment he said so this period between the end of 
november and january when congress reconvenes will be a critical 
period 
dodd said that if president cristiani demonstrates that he can 
regain control that hes not going to allow the death squads to 
operate then i think you minimize the possibility of reducing 
aid 
however he said if cristiani is not in political control 
by january there will certainly be some conditionality placed on 
that aid when congress comes back 
sen connie mack rfla interviewed on the same program said 
about the killing of the priests that president cristiani has 
already come forward and said he thought that this was a barbaric 
act that there should be investigations he asked for assistance 
the slayings came during the biggest offensive mounted by 
leftist guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
during the 10yearold war fighting has raged in the capital of 
san salvador and throughout the country since it was launched a 
week ago 
mack said that i think we ought to be concentrating on what in 
fact the guerrillas have been up to their intentions i think 
were clear to try to decapitate the cristiani government this is 
an act of desperation i believe

defense ministry said sunday 
no agenda items have been disclosed for cheneys twoday trip 
which begins sunday and it is not related to the dec 23 
superpower summit off the malta coast according to a ministry 
spokesman 
cheney was invited earlier this year by frits bolkesteijn 
defense minister in premier ruud lubbers centerright government 
said the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity in line 
with ministry policy 
bolkesteijn is a member of the rightwing liberal party a 
staunchly pronato group that is now in the opposition 
cheney will now meet bolkesteijns successor relus ter beek a 
labor party member known for his prodisarmament views and 
commitment to slashing defense spending 
the new dutch government the third headed by lubbers has 
announced it will cut the growth in defense spending to about 6 
percent of the netherlands net national income and aim for zero 
growth after two years 
the new government took office last week following a national 
election sept 6 
in the early 1980s the labor party was strongly opposed to 
plans to put 48 nucleartipped us cruise missiles on dutch soil 
that stance effectively banished ter beeks group to the opposition 
benches for the better part of the decade 
lubbers decided to accept the missiles in 1985 but they were 
never brought in because of the superpower pact on

us ambassador john mccarthy presented 
his credentials and pledged the united states support for new 
president rene mouawad amid joyous parades sunday in syrianpoliced 
northern lebanon 
the latest us pledge was contained in a message from president 
bush which mccarthy handed to mouawad along with his letter of 
credence 
the message also stressed support for an arab leaguebrokered 
peace pact approved by parliament at a special session held last 
month in taif saudi arabia over the objections of christian 
leader gen michel aoun 
mccarthy who withdrew in september after reported threats from 
aoun became the first foreign diplomat to present his credentials 
to mouawad since parliament elected the catholic lawmaker as 
president nov 5 
it also was the first time in lebanons modern history that a 
foreign ambassador presented his credentials outside the 
traditional seat of the head of state in baabda east of beirut 
aoun occupies the presidential palace 
about 5000 aoun loyalists staged what they called a freedom 
rally in christian east beirut they brandished lebanese flags 
and aouns pictures chanting with blood with souls we support 
the general during the hourlong display televised on aouns 
television station 
bush in the letter assured mouawad of the steadfast support 
of the united states for your presidency and for lebanon 
we intend to work hard in the days and weeks ahead to manifest 
our support bush said the text of the letter was made available 
to reporters by the mouawads press office 
i hope your election as president will finally bring an end to 
the senseless violence that lebanon has had to endure for far too 
long 
we believe that the implemenation of the taif agreement will 
be the first step toward the restoration of the unity independence 
and sovereignty of lebanon over all its territory free from all 
foreign occupation bush added 
some 50000 drumbeating supporters of mouawad a maronite 
catholic marched through the streets of ehden in the foothills of 
the cedar mountains as mccarthy presented his credentials at 
mouawads ancestral palace 
dozens of ululating women tossed red and yellow roses at 
mccarthys bulletproof white cadillac when it pulled to a stop at 
the palace at 11 am 
as the ambassador and his first secretary david sutterfield 
climbed out of the limousine the women sprayed them with rose 
water and rice in the traditional expression of welcome 
mouawad 64 was flanked by senior christian and moslem 
politicians during the ceremony a band of honor played the 
national anthems of the two countries in the courtyard 
mccarthy said mouawads election is the end of the storm from 
our point of view the ship is nearly back in port 
mccarthy left for damascus syria after the ceremony and a 
lunch with mouawad to catch a flight back to the united states 
the us embassy is in the east beirut suburb of aukar which is 
controlled by aouns troops mccarthy and other us diplomats 
evacuated the embassy on sept 6 after aoun loyalists besieged it 
and left lebanon 
aoun who heads an interim cabinet that he considers the sole 
legitimate authorities in lebanon rejected as unconstitutional 
mouawads election he called the president a syrian lackey 
elected under the bayonets of syrian occupation he rejected the

georgias legislature declared sunday that the 
republics incorporation into the soviet union nearly 70 years ago 
resulted from a military intervention and said it retains the right 
to secede 
the lawmakers also said they reserve the right to cancel soviet 
laws that are not in the best interest of their southern republic 
the strong statements by the supreme soviet of georgia further 
complicate the kremlins attempts to rein in the 15 soviet 
republics at a time when ethnic tensions and drives for 
independence are mounting 
georgian nationalist activists at the price of imprisonment 
have maintained for decades that the republic was taken by force 
when the soviet red army invaded in 1921 ending three years of 
independence 
the official soviet view shared by georgian leaders was that 
the operation was necessary to rid georgia of forces opposing the 
bolshevik revolution of 1917 on sunday georgian leaders made an 
aboutface 
from a legal viewpoint the entry of troops into georgia and 
the seizing of the entire territory was military interference or 
intervention and occupation with the goal of changing the existing 
political structure tass quoted a declaration as saying from the 
legislative session in georgias capital tbilisi 
the report said the georgian legislature approved a commissions 
report containing that declaration and also branding the 
incorporation of the republic for all intents and purposes an 
annexation 
an informal georgian political group the national independence 
party of georgia has been calling on georgias 54 million people 
to boycott forthcoming elections to the supreme soviet to press for 
independence 
in april 19 people were killed during a proindependence 
demonstration in tbilisi when troops charged a crowd a 20th was 
shot and killed by police later for violating a curfew 
the lawmakers voted to ask the national parliament the congress 
of peoples deputies to review the report at its next session dec 
12 
in another challenge to the kremlin the georgian supreme soviet 
said the republic reserves for itself the right of freely leaving 
the ussr and reserves the right to cancel soviet laws if they 
are not in georgias interest 
president mikhail s gorbachev has repeatedly ruled out 
redrawing the countrys borders and on nov 10 the presidium or 
executive council of the nations legislature criticized four 
other republics for similar declarations 
the presidium said laws in azerbaijan and the three baltic 
republics of latvia lithuania and estonia have no force because 
they contradict the soviet constitution the officials did not 
specify which laws they meant but the four republics parliaments 
have passed measures declaring their sovereignty and reserving 
the right to veto laws passed in moscow

the death of a black burglary suspect who 
was chased by residents and suffocated when he was pinned down in a 
field has this small town dodging charges of racism 
it has trapped some of its residents between a lost innocence 
and what they fear is the hopeless task of convincing outsiders 
they are not racists who chased james oliver king jr merely 
because he was black 
this is never going to go away said james lucko one of 
kings pursuers and mayor of the town 60 miles south of dallas 
a few have promised as much including one former mayor who 
plans to organize a protest march against the racism he contends 
struck down king about 70 of the towns 300 residents are black 
but others say those charges are fueled by the former mayors 
grudge against the city and the loss of business at his store and 
they grieve at the suggestion of racism 
it aint right said martin degner please let us get 
back to our little old country life 
meanwhile pearlie mae king of waco is crying over the monthold 
grave of her son thursday would have been his 25th birthday and 
he had promised her he was changing his life 
but like other things in kings young life plans went awry 
he quit school in 1982 to become a construction worker he also 
became an inept criminal four times he was jailed for theft and 
burglary charges and in 1983 he was sentenced to serve three years 
for burglary 
i wanted to get some money to get him out of jail but he told 
me to let him stay mrs king recalled he said i did wrong 
and im going to pay for it and he went and served his time 
he had been living with his mother and outwardly appeared to be 
trying to make good on his life 
but oct 9 he allegedly broke into a home in malone 25 miles 
to the north emma piel said she came home that afternoon and found 
king standing in her bedroom 
he ran from the home she hurried to luckos grocery store 
soon several men were chasing king the chase wound around town 
as the suspect jumped over gates ran down alleyways and slid 
through fences somewhere along the way he picked up a brick the 
men said later 
when we had him trapped for a time inside a goatpen i told 
him to put the brick down lucko recalled i said just talk 
to me 
but he said no touch me and youre going to get hurt 
at one point ray watson said he aimed a 22caliber pistol as 
king was being chased toward him down an alley but he said he 
couldnt bring himselt to fire because i could no more have shot 
that man than i could fly 
trying to flee across a freshly plowed field king was quickly 
surrounded and overcome by three men lucko sat across kings legs 
while two others held his arms trying to get him to let go of the 
brick and hold him until officers arrived 
after five or seven minutes he let go of the brick and we 
quit restraining him as hard said lucko 
lucko said they were stunned when a hill county deputy told them 
the man was dead attempts to revive him failed 
all we wanted to do is retain him nobody wanted to kill 
him said watson who followed the chase in his truck 
john parker a medical examiner in dallas ruled kings death a 
homicide saying it was caused by sustained pressure on his chest 
and abdomen and strangulation tests for drugs and alcohol were 
negative 
it was not a classic accident thats why we called it a 
homicide it was very unusual parker said 
but a grand jury tuesday declined to issue any indictments in 
the case 
i think all of these men were doing what they thought was 
right and what they thought was their civic duty and i dont think 
that can be said of everybody these days said hill county 
district attorney dan dent 
mrs king planted a small cedar tree on her sons grave thursday 
although i know they killed my baby i dont have hatred in my 
heart for those peoples she said im going to pray for them 
i want justice but its not going to bring him back i just 
want someone to talk to me and tell me what happened 
watson the towns mayor pro tem says he plans to invite mrs 
king to town to discuss her sons death 
these bigcity reporters came out here and tried to glorify 
this but it was not racial it was not vigilante he said 
tommy westmoreland is among those complaining most vigorously 
saying king would still be alive if he were white westmoreland 
who is white ia trying to organize a protest march next weekend 
and hopes to invite kings parents 
the owner of a grocery store he acknowledges some have asked if 
he has an ax to grind against lucko who owns the towns only other 
grocery store he is embroiled in a zoning dispute with the city 
because officials contend he illegally built a store addition 
i dont have to bring lucko down this way westmoreland 
said but theres racism in this town they see me as a 
hellraiser 
if there is racism some of the towns blacks dont see if that 
way 
they treat me right said walter thompson as he entered 
westmorelands store thats all i can say they treat me all 
right

the united states should cut its forces in 
europe and the western military alliance must adapt to reforms in 
the soviet bloc two former white house national security advisers 
said sunday 
the pattern of postwar politics as it has developed for the 
last 40 years is now at an end henry kissinger the former 
national security adviser and secretary of state from the nixon and 
ford administrations said in a televised interview 
defense secretary dick cheney also said that up to 40000 us 
troops could be withdrawn from europe through ongoing eastwest 
negotiations and that the pentagon budget could be cut because of 
the declining soviet threat 
and zbigniew brzezinski president carters security adviser 
urged that billions of dollars be shifted from defense to help the 
nations of eastern europe move from communism to democracy and a 
market economy 
the ideas and proposals came as east europeans inspired by the 
policies of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev instituted their 
own reforms that have kept the west scrambling to keep pace 
kissinger cheney and brzezinski in separate television 
interviews agreed the soviet military threat was subsiding 
kissinger predicted that east and west germany would be reunited 
within five years and said a unified germany should be integrated 
into existing western security and economic arrangements 
in the immediate future i think that the use of military 
force in soviet foreign policy is sharply reduced although i think 
it is much too early to draw a final balance sheet since the 
process hasnt worked itself out yet in the soviet union and not 
even in eastern europe said kissinger 
i agree that nato has to be recast the present american 
military establishment in europe cannot be and should not be 
maintained but one has to make that part of a general european 
security system said kissinger appearing on the abctv program 
this week with david brinkley 
cheney appearing later on the same program said its clear 
that the likelihood of allout conflict between the us and the 
soviet union between nato and the warsaw pact is probably lower 
now than its been at just about any time since the end of world 
war ii 
while administration officials have said they see no need to 
change the north atlantic treaty organization cheney said he hoped 
that nato and warsaw pact negotiations would finish work within a 
year on president bushs proposal to cut us forces in europe by 
40000 
the conventional force negotiations would require both 
superpowers to reduce their military presence in central europe 
with much sharper cuts in troops and tanks by the soviet union 
brzezinski who recently returned from moscow proposed a 
central european recovery fund along the lines of the marshall plan 
that promoted west european economic recovery after world war ii 
we spend about 150 billion on the defense of europe about 
half of our defense budget brzezinski said on the nbctv 
program meet the press 
if we can reduce the level of the confrontation in central 
europe we will gain flexibility in dealing with central europe 
economically financially that we havent had until now he said 
congress has authorized 938 million to bolster reform 
governments in poland and hungary over the next three years about 
twice the level proposed by the bush administration however 
legislation to actually appropriate that and other foreign aid 
money is bogged down over other matters including whether to 
withhold money from united nations family planning programs that 
might encourage abortion 
brzezinski said money saved on defense and used for the 
creation of a central european recovery fund would give the 
united states the point of departure for restructuring existing 
arrangements in central europe together with the west europeans 
and the japanese 
on germany unification said kissinger i do not believe that 
it is desirable for the west to let itself be maneuvered into the 
position where we collude with the soviet union in keeping germany 
divided it would be highly dangerous if we got in the way of what 
the people of germany want 
the security of europe has been shattered repeatedly over the 
past century because of expanding german economic and military 
might he noted 
faced with rapid change he said the west must negotiate the 
pace negotiate security arrangements in central europe and 
hopefully see that germany remains part of the european community 
and the western security system and that is a tall order 
one of the tasks of american diplomacy and western diplomacy 
is to convince the soviets that a germany integrated into the west 
in some manner together with a security system in europe is safer 
for the soviet union and i would argue especially for the soviet 
union than a germany of 80 million especially as a loose cannon in 
the center of europe trying to play both sides against the 
middle he said

the government will not yield to leftist 
rebel demands for a freeze in gasoline prices the state petroleum 
chief said in a report sunday after guerrilla threats of attacks on 
petroleum facilities 
the national liberation army known as eln said saturday in a 
message to a national petroleum forum that it will renew its 
attacks on the industry if the government carries out a planned 
gasoline price rise at the end of this month 
andres restrepo londono president of the government petroleum 
company ecopetrol indicated at the forum in bogota that the 
unspecified price rise would go through as planned 
my answer to the eln is based on principles for the 
government any type of extortion is unacceptable restrepo 
londono was quoted as saying in the sunday edition of el tiempo 
the countrys leading newspaper 
the elns threat to renew its attacks came days after the 
government announced record oil production of 440000 barrels for 
the month of october 
industry experts predict petroleum will become colombias 
principal foreign exchange earner next year surpassing coffee 
which has fallen dramatically in price since the august breakup of 
an international coffee agreement 
last year petroleum exports earned colombia 937 million in 
foreign exchange according to ecopetrol colombia earned 16 
billion in foreign exchange from coffee sales the same year 
ecopetrol estimates petroleum earnings will drop to 900 million 
this year because of eln attacks which have cost the industry 485 
million since they began in 1986 
the guerrilla group inspired by the teachings of fidel castro 
and led by a defrocked priest has perpetrated 112 firebomb and 
dynamite attacks on the countrys main oil pipeline and other 
ecopetrol facilities the pipeline runs between the eastern cano 
limon oil field and the atlantic coast 
 
the leftist guerrilla group is using the attacks to try to 
pressure the government into nationalizing the countrys petroleum 
industry

a british warship commander said sunday 
that foreign navies will remain in the persian gulf to protect 
merchant ships as long as iran and iraq technically remain at war 
15 months after a unbrokered ceasefire 
its not as tense as last year and its all very routine 
said cmdr paul d stone but the situation is still unstable as 
theres no lasting peace 
stone commander of the guided missile destroyer hms manchester 
warned it doesnt take much to start an incident 
he spoke to a group of reporters who visited the manchester 
while on a port call to bahrain the vessel is part of fourunit 
armilla patrol three warships and a navy tanker that britain 
maintains in the gulf 
britain and other western powers that beefed up their military 
presence in the waterway at the height of the iraniraq war reduced 
the number of their vessels in the region after the ceasefire took 
hold aug 20 1988 
but peace negotiations launched after the truce have made no 
progress toward a permanent settlement of the conflict which began 
in 1980 
the soviet union had seven to nine units in the waterway before 
the ceasefire and stone said they were now down to about three 
or four warships and a couple of support ships at any time 
the united states maintains some 10 units in the region 
including three minesweepers inside the persian gulf and a 
battleship group of seven to eight units in the arabian sea navy

flags at the peak of the iraniraq hostilities to protect them from 
fallout of the war on the waterway they now just a watch from a 
distance 
we keep tabs and we chat them up occasionally and they are 
very happy to have us here as an insurance policy stone said 
occasionally we see an iranian warship we talk to them they 
speak jolly good english and they are friendly he said

buck helm the longshoreman rescued from a 
flattened freeway 3 days after the oct 17 earthquake was mourned 
sunday as a gutsy symbol of endurance his death raised the toll 
from the quake to 67 
helm 58 died of respiratory failure saturday night at 
kaiserpermanente medical center in oakland said hospital 
spokesman ron treleven no other details on his death were 
available 
bucks passing pretty much took everyone by surprise because 
he was improving gary frischer a spokesman for helms family 
said in a statement 
helm had been taken off a kidney dialysis machine and doctors 
had hoped to wean him from the respirator that had enabled him to 
breathe 
his death raised the toll from the collapse of the doubledeck 
nimitz freeway in oakland to 42 overall the 71magnitude quake 
killed 67 people injured more than 2800 left more than 14000 
homeless and caused an estimated 7 billion in damage 
to many buck had become a symbol of survival and hope 
frischer said for the helmses the thousands of cards and 
letters from all corners of the world gave buck and the family 
strength and encouragement and for that they are forever 
grateful 
others were rescued from the 1mile collapsed section of 
interstate 880 shortly after the quake hit but helm was the only 
person to be pulled alive from the rubble after rescue crews began 
searching the wrecked road 
rescuers had given up hope of finding more survivors when an 
engineer testing the structures stability saw helm wave from 
inside his small car oct 21 a large beam that fell in front of 
helms chevrolet sprint saved it from being flattened 
the 220pound 5foot10 helm suffered a fractured skull 
fractured neck three broken ribs nerve damage to his leg and 
kidney problems caused by dehydration he already had diabetes and 
high blood pressure 
helm a longshoremans clerk who worked the docks in oakland 
commuted 250 miles each weekend to visit his family in the small 
town of weaverville 
his former wife lorrie helm and the couples children were 
frequently at his side during his hospitalization she said he 
acknowledged hearing his family read the cards and letters sent to 
him by well wishers but couldnt speak because of the respirator 
helms rescue had buoyed frustrated rescue workers who had been 
finding only corpses in the rubble of i880 
im sure this will hit a lot of people hard steve whipple 
the state department of transportation worker who found helm said 
after learning of his death 
i was under the impression that he was going to make it 
whipple said by telephone from his home in pittsburg it was just 
going to take a long while 
im still glad we found him and gave him a better fighting 
chance than he would have had otherwise whipple said it 
picked our spirits up and made all our work worth it 
the news also stunned residents of weaverville where signs 
saying good luck buck were with you remained in merchants 
windows 
its really depressing said trinity county supervisor dee 
potter an awful lot of people have been praying for him 
we were talking about what to do when he comes home potter 
said 
funeral arrangements were not immediately released 
helms death came amid other signs of hope in the san francisco 
bay area traffic flowed across the oaklandsan francisco bay 
bridge on saturday the first time motorists were able to cross the 
span since the quake knocked out a 50foot section 
in the santa cruz area near the quake epicenter a highway

residents watching the cutting of a 90foot 
spruce selected as the us capitols christmas tree went scurrying 
for cover when the falling tree twisted out of control and crashed 
across a road 
the giant spruce toppled onto a crane mounted on a logging truck 
waiting to haul it away ten feet broke off the top when volunteers 
tried to move it at the kootenai national forest in northwestern 
montana 
a crowd of about 300 was on hand for the treecutting saturday 
afterward the woodcutters felled another tree down the road 
deemed acceptable by the capitols landscape architect when he 
visited the forest in june 
wed like to say it went perfect the first time but it 
didnt said bill crismore of libby who had been given the honor 
of cutting the tree 
only about 61 feet of the tree can be shipped to washington 
because that is the length of the enclosed rail car that will carry 
it he said the 41yearold englelmann spruce will be erected on 
the west front lawn of the capitol 
us forest service spokeswoman jeannie spooner said guy wires 
were attached to the first tree to lower it but the tension on the 
wires apparently wasnt even 
spooner said the montana tree is not the the nations 
christmas tree that distinction goes to a tree planted near the 
white house in 1972 that the president lights each year 
montana is providing the capitol tree because the state is 
celebrating its centennial this year

abortion foes expect to chalk up another 
victory with a restrictive law in michigan but abortion rights 
forces are banking on the legislatures inability to override a 
promised veto from gov james blanchard 
both sides say theres no doubt a bill restricting abortions 
will pass in the house next month as it did in the senate in 
october by a 298 vote 
with such wide public support for a parental rights measure 
we fully expect our representatives to reflect the will of the 
citizens of michigan said barbara listing president of the 
antiabortion group michigan right to life after the senate 
approval 
but both sides also acknowledge that the democratcontrolled 
house cant muster enough votes to override a veto by the 
democratic governor who has pledged to strike down any bill 
restricting access to abortion 
the bill pending in a house committee would require unmarried 
girls under the age of 18 to get one parents consent before 
getting an abortion as an alternative they could also seek 
permission from a probate judge who would have to determine if she 
was mature enough to make the choice and if it was in her best 
interests 
a similar bill already has cleared the republicancontrolled 
senate which has enough votes to override a veto but a twothirds 
majority of the houses 109 members is also needed to override a 
veto 
the action in michigan comes on the heels of the pennsylvania 
legislatures decision to place tough restrictions on abortion 
pennsylvanias bill signed into law friday is the first since the 
us supreme courts ruling in july upholding certain abortion 
restrictions in missouri 
the pennsylvania bill requires married women to notify husbands 
about abortion plans abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy 
would be banned and women would have to wait 24 hours after 
learning of their pregnancy before getting an abortion 
the antichoice people are going to run around looking for as 
many victories as they can without people realizing they are not 
victories at all said rep maxine berman one of the prochoice 
leaders in the michigan house 
in michigan a vote in the house committee is scheduled for dec 
4 and speaker lewis dodak plans to hold a full house vote and send 
the bill to the senate before legislators go home for the holidays 
since the governor has two weeks to veto the measure that 
probably will push the veto override vote into early next year 
the legislature has overridden only one veto in the past 38 
years that coming in 1977 on an obscure administrative rules bill 
berman said the antiabortion victory in pennsylvania actually 
might have helped the prochoice side 
pennsylvania is known as one of the most neanderthal states on 
this issue berman said this might hurt antichoice forces 
because it was so out of line so reactionary and so punishing that 
it opened up a lot of eyes on what these people are really up to 
margy long a spokeswoman for planned parenthood affiliates of 
michigan said victories by prochoice candidates in virginia and 
new jersey gubernatorial elections this month have sent a warning 
signal to politicians elsewhere 
its going to be part of the election you can just bet on 
it agreed rep michael griffin a sponsor of the bill its 
possible this may end up as a ballot issue 
a year ago michigan voters decided to ban statefunded 
abortions for poor women taking action via a referendum after two 
decades of failures in the legislature lawmakers tried 17 times to 
end the funding but blanchard vetoed seven and his republican 
predecessor gov william milliken struck down 10

a government committee suggested renaming 
lulings old spanish trail catfish street but the new name 
didnt smell quite right to folks around here 
you should have seen the faces drop when i announced it would 
be catfish street said pastor robert zehr of the mennonite 
church established 53 years ago in this town nearly 15 miles west 
of new orleans 
zehr said his congregation was appalled at the prospect even if 
their street would be named for one of louisianas most famous 
exports old spanish trail has a solid dignified ring to it and 
the church is proud to have that address the minister said 
the committee has been working to eliminate a multitude of st 
charles parish streets with identical or similar names 
there are seven first streets around the parish and luling 
alone has oak lane oak place and oak avenue old spanish trail 
one of many roads around the state recalling the days of spanish 
rule runs about eight miles from boutte to des allemands 
the committee has had other problems doing its job 
in luling a street named for conquistador hernando cortez in 
the coronado park subdivision had to be renamed because des 
allemands has a cortez lane the committee suggested magellan to go 
along with balboa coronado and desoto 
no good 
we wanted to stay with the spanish names said ken riggin of 
the coronado civic association magellan was not actually 
spanish he was contracted by the spanish but he was portuguese 
the committee settled on pizarro

the name leinenkugel might cause some beer 
drinkers to raise their eyebrows sooner than their mugs but miller 
brewing co hopes the brand with a cult following in the upper 
midwest can do the same elsewhere 
miller last year bought the jacob leinenkugel brewing co a 
small familyrun brewery for more than a century in chippewa 
falls wis 
the nations no 2 brewer behind anheuserbusch cos inc is 
using its muscle to test the brand in seattle and western 
massachusetts 
the test started earlier this year comes at a flat time in the 
domestic beer market with companies trying more experiments to 
gain a bigger share 
miller really knows how to introduce new products said 
robert weinberg a beer analyst and a professor of marketing 
management at washington university in st louis 
according to industry estimates leinenkugel sold nearly 100000 
barrels last year compared with national brands that sell in the 
millions 
if the leinenkugel brand tickles people either because of the 
name or the taste miller could take it national overnight 
weinberg said 
jake leinenkugel who remained an executive at the brewery after 
the buyout said miller is trying to take a lowkey approach in 
promoting the beer 
we want to go in a little mysterious a little quiet

the archbishop of san salvador 
speaking at the funeral mass for six slain jesuit priests said 
these brutal murders place our country in the first place of 
barbarity in the world 
roman catholic monsignor arturo rivera damas said of the 
massacre there exists the vehement presumption that the murders 
were committed by members of the armed forces or people in intimate 
connivance with them 
about 800 mourners many of them weeping crowded the chapel at 
simeon canas central american university or stood outside listening 
to the service broadcast over loudspeakers 
the bodies of the priests were placed in a crypt in the chapel 
at the university where they worked and where they were killed 
early thursday also slain were their cook elba ramos and her 
15yearold daughter celina they were buried in a family tomb 
president alfredo cristiani who attended the funeral service at 
the university auditorium has promised that those responsible for 
the massacre will be punished 
rivera damas told reporters we hold him cristiani to his 
word 
others attending the funeral included foreign minister jose 
manuel pacas us ambassador william walker and the ambassadors of 
mexico spain and costa rica 
the rev jose maria tojeira head of the jesuit order in central 
america said in a homily at the service love is stronger than 
death the colleagues and disciples of our deceased brothers will 
always be at the side of the poor 
with this murder they have not killed the society of jesus 
they have not killed the central american university said 
tojeira tears streaming down his face 
in a message read at the mass pope john paul ii expressed his 
hope that the sacrifice of these priests becomes the seed of 
fraternal love and an inspiration that we become each day more 
complete artisans of peace 
other priests reported two witnesses who they declined to 
identify said they saw about 30 men in military uniforms enter the 
house where the victims were sleeping before dawn thursday 
shortly before the shooting began 
the eight were roused from bed shot and their brains removed as 
a macabre message to intellectuals who advocate changes in 
salvadoran society to aid the poor 
the six priests had been accused by the governmentcontrolled 
news media of sympathizing with the rebels 
militant members of cristianis republican nationalist alliance 
or arena have frequently said liberal catholic priests and 
protestant missionary workers are supporting the rebels who have 
been waging war against usbacked governments for more than 10 
years 
attorney general mauricio colorado said sunday that rivera damas 
and a roman catholic auxiliary bishop should leave el salvador for 
their own safety in a letter to the pope released saturday 
colorado accused certain bishops of fomenting violence and 
asked they be withdrawn 
the six priests were slain as guerrillas and troops battled 
through the outskirts of san salvador in an offensive the rebels 
launched nov 11 
two of the victims were the university rector ignacio 
ellacuria and ignacio martinbaro one of the regions polling 
specialists 
rivera damas has been an oustpoken advocate of a ceasefire and 
truce in the war that has claimed more than 70000 lives the pope 
also has appealed for a resumption of peace talks broken off 
earlier this month

at least eight cities braved icy winds sunday to keep the heat on 
the communist leadership despite open borders and the election of 
a reformminded cabinet one day earlier 
nearly 3 million east germans crossed into west berlin and west 
germany between friday and sunday the second weekend since the 
government opened borders to the west border police said most 
were just visiting for the day

border resumed sunday at hitzacker about 80 miles southeast of 
hamburg for the first time since april 23 1945 
in other changes the official adn news agency reported that the 
roles of the party and the government in east germanys armed 
forces will be separated 
also sunday an opposition leader said his prodemocracy group 
would hold a convention next month to establish itself as a formal 
political party 
wolfgang schnur in an interview with west germanys ard 
television network said his democratic awakening opposition group 
will meet dec 1617 the same time the communist party will be 
holding a special session in east berlin to look at further 
leadership changes 
communist chief egon krenz assured east germans in a televised 
interview late sunday that he will fight for political reform if 
the party is of another opinion then they should find another 
general secretary he said at his east berlin home 
adn said 50000 people participated in dresdens first 
officially authorized protest rally other estimates of the crowd 
size ranged up to 100000 
lord dont forgive them because they knew what they did 
said one banner in the southern city making a biting play on words 
from jesus christs agony on the cross 
in east berlin thousands participated in an unauthorized march 
from the alexanderplatz square to parliament calling for sweeping 
reforms and abolition of the communist partys guaranteed monopoly 
on power 
parliament on saturday confirmed a reformminded cabinet of 
communist premier hans modrow and created a committee to study 
possible constitutional changes including dropping a law 
guaranteeing communist rule 
we wont let ourselves be blinded by the open borders said 
one protest banner swap ddr east germany for mickey mouse 
said another 
one sign suggested honecker to court and speakers called 
for prosecution of the countrys former leaders including ousted 
president and party chief erich honecker who was replaced by krenz 
oct 18 
krenz was quoted by a west german newspaper as saying honecker 
is one of those under investigation by a parliamentary commission 
just outside the capital about 30000 communist party backers 
demonstrated in potsdam to show their support for the governments 
announced reform program adn said 
adn reported other prodemocracy rallies sunday in a halfdozen 
cities and towns 20000 people in erfurt 10000 in meiningen 
also 10000 in frankfurt an der oder 3000 in schwedt and 2000 in 
neustrelitz the official agency said thousands protested in 
karl marx stadt but did not give a more precise crowd estimate for 
the march there or in east berlin 
at least some demonstrators were cool to the idea of unifying 
the two germanys a subject of much debate since east german 
borders opened nov 9 
reunification now no thanks read one of the banners at 
the dresden march we are not on the reeperbahn where you can buy 
a union for money it added referring to the famous redlight 
district in hamburg west germany 
the demonstrators marched a twomile route to a rally at 
dresdens theater square 
joining the marchers on the sidewalk was andreas leber a 
40yearold lutheran pastor at the cathedral in nearby meissen 
with one hand he held a pram carrying his baby son and with the 
other a cardboard sign saying our people need the communist party 
like a fish needs a bicycle he drew much laughter 
meissen was left intact in world war ii he told a reporter 
but 40 years of socialism has left one third of the city 
derelict 
in another reform measure adn said sunday that the roles of the 
communist party and the government in running the army will be 
clearly separated from now on 
the political directorate of the 173000strong national 
peoples army proposed that guidelines setting out the partys grip 
on the army be suspended and that secretariats of the political 
organs in the army command be dissolved adn said 
the dispatch gave no further details but it appeared clear east 
germany is following a soviet lead in moves toward a 
lesspoliticized army

in decembers presidential election runoff 
the superior electoral court said with 97 percent of the ballots 
counted da silva of the socialist workers party was in second 
place with 113 million votes for 161 percent while leftwing 
populist leonel brizola had 111 million votes for 157 percent 
the two candidates had been very close in slow vote counting 
from wednesdays election it was evident several days ago that 
rightist fernando collor de mello had finished first among the 21 
candidates

of the ballots cast in the election the countrys first direct 
presidential vote since 1960 
as no candidate received a majority da silva and collor de 
mello will face each other in a runoff scheduled for dec 17 
the electoral court president jose francisco rezek said final 
ballots wold be counted monday and an official announcement would 
only be made nov 27 he said however it was mathmatically 
impossible for brizola to overtake da silva 
brizola of the democratic labor party refused to concede 
supporters of da silva popularly known as lula staged victory 
rallies in several cities sunday 
da silva had no comment late sunday but his partys president 
luis gushiken promised to unmask collor de mello in the second 
round and show the people what he is a member of the elite that 
opposes needed social change 
collor de mello said the workers party ideological rigidity 
will give us a huge victory in december 
brizola said he would ask for votes in some regions to be 
rechecked 
da silva was in third throughout counting saturday but surged 
sunday afternoon when votes from minas gerais and the impoverished 
northeast rolled in 
in sao paulo 1000 da silva supporters jammed avenida paulista 
one of the citys major thoroughfares and danced embraced and 
sang the workers party anthem 
in rio da silvas backers paraded through the wealthy south 
zone honked horns waved huge red party flags and piled into bars 
to make victory toasts 
brizola has almost fanatical support in rio where he received 
over 50 percent of the vote and globo brazils largest television 
network showed film footage of the candidates backers weeping at 
party headquarters as election returns confirmed da silvas victory

gasoline may have been poured inadvertently 
into a kerosene heater just before it exploded inside a mobile 
home killing a woman her five children and their three young 
cousins a rescue official said sunday 
theyre really not sure yet said randy mcarthur commander 
of the maxton rescue squad he said investigators were currently 
focusing on that as a possible cause 
killed in the 330 am blaze saturday were lois ann hunt 32 
and her five children alisha 12 melissa 11 larry 5 bobby 
ray 3 and nikki 2 three other children staying in mrs hunts

and daniel locklear 2 
their mother joann locklear 25 of maxton is mrs hunts 
niece she and her companion richard eugene tyndall 22 of 
laurinburg escaped the fire with minor injuries 
the 11 people were sleeping in the 60footlong threebedroom 
mobile home when neighbors reported being awakened by an explosion 
and saw the trailer engulfed in intense flames within three minutes 
it sounded like a shotgun going off said anthony locklear 
38 who lives across the street and is not related to joann 
locklear by the time i got out of the house it was just 
blazing 
mrs locklear and tyndall broke a bedroom window and climbed 
out a frantic locklear tried to reenter the mobile home screaming

make sure the kerosene heater doesnt go out tyndall told 
anthony locklear the child apparently got out of bed to refill the 
heater with kerosene 
investigators said alisha mistakenly might have put gasoline in

touched off a propane tank hunt used for cooking officials said 
hunt supported her five children by working as a cook at a 
nearby hardees she had been estranged from her husband robert 
for more than a year evelyn porter a neighbor and friend told

romanian leaders turned back 
reporters planning to cover the communist party congress and 
restricted tourist travel to and from the country news reports and 
journalists said sunday 
the political platform adopted ahead of the 14th congress of the 
romanian communist party calls for an intensified ideological 
struggle and the encouragement of all antiimperialist and 
revolutionary forces in the world according to yugoslavias 
official tanjug news agency 
however hungarys ruling socialist party on sunday urged 
romania to join other east bloc countries and make democratic 
reforms the hungarian party which changed its name from the 
communist party in one of a series of reforms earlier this year 
said it would not send a representative to the congress the 
official hungarian news agency mti said 
the french news agency afps vienna chief of bureau jean 
burner was declared unwelcome by romanian authorities and barred 
from the country afp said 
for burner who has headed afps vienna bureau since august it 
would have been his first official trip to romania another french

east bloc country most opposed to any significant political reform 
ceausescu even urged his warsaw pact allies to intervene to block 
solidaritys takeover in poland

the elderly owner of a 17thcentury 
plantation said to be the site of the first thanksgiving is trying 
to save it from being sold off in parts because of onerous 
inheritance taxes 
i feel like were caretakers of the place for the public 
said malcolm jamieson who has spent much of his life restoring 
berkeley plantations bare grounds and its manor to their original 
splendor 
the plantation which sits along the james river between 
richmond and williamsburg has a rich history 
the first thanksgiving in the colonies was celebrated at 
berkeley on dec 4 1619 more than a year before the pilgrims had 
their betterknown thanksgiving dinner in what is now plymouth 
mass according to the great plantation by virginia historian 
clifford dowdey 
the mansion was built in 1726 william henry harrison the ninth 
president of the united states was born there george washington 
and the nine presidents who followed him dined at berkeley 
the first bourbon was distilled at the plantation taps was 
composed there and president lincoln reviewed troops there during 
the civil war according to the great plantation 
the tourists are saving it jamieson said if it werent 
for the tourists we couldnt keep these places on our outside 
income 
jamieson estimated that 50000 people visit berkeley annually 
adults pay a 7 admission fee and children pay 350 
jamieson said the money from tourists may not be enough when he 
dies he estimated inheritance taxes on the house and a little more 
than 1000 acres at nearly 1 million 
jamieson who gives his age as over 80 said that after years of 
research he has not found a way around the tax problem 
he already has prepared building sites in the woods should his 
son need to sell part of the land he said he has been offered 
100000 for four acres along the james river 
theres too much american history here to cut it up said 
jamieson who feels that inheritance taxes should be deferred for 
properties like berkeley that are open to the public and are on the 
national register of historic landmarks 
the idea is an old one but a good one said carl nelson 
spokesman for the national trust for historic preservation in 
washington 
its an idea that really needs to be looked at closely he 
said 
the sixmonth property tax bill about 600 in 1926 when 
jamieson inherited part of the plantation and bought the rest from 
his relatives has grown to about 16000 jamieson said 
jamiesons father john bought the house and surrounding acres 
in 1905 the jamiesons opened the house to the public in 1938 
admissions money is used to maintain the house and grounds the 
jamiesons live from revenue from the farm and nursery on the 
property jamieson his son jamie and six others run the farm and 
act as guides 
jamieson has planted trees and shrubbery and restored the 
original five terraces leading down to the river he and his son 
grow boxwoods which they sell busch gardens amusement park pricey 
developments on the james river near williamsburg and others 
the hard work has pushed up the value of his property which 
today has an estimated worth of 2 million to 3 million according 
to jamieson 
jamieson said he has asked us rep herbert bateman rva for 
help with his proposal for deferred estate taxes 
bateman said he is drafting legislation to address jamiesons 
concerns 
i think he has a very legitimate concern bateman said i 
am sympathetic the tradeoff is better assurance that historic 
properties at the death of the owner remain open and available to 
the public as historic properties they can see and touch and 
experience

leftist guerrillas withdrew 
from most areas they had seized around san salvador sunday winding 
down their biggest offensive of the civil war and pulling back to 
their mountain strongholds 
archbishop arturo rivera damas warned that a dreadful wave of 
revenge repression and witch hunting may follow may follow the 
guerrilla withdrawal the attorney general said rivera damas and a 
roman catholic auxiliary bishop should leave el salvador for their 
own safety 
about 800 mourners attended the burial of six jesuit priests and 
two others who were slain and mutilated early thursday at their 
residence at jose simeon canas central american university 
the united states has pressed rightist president alfredo 
cristiani for a full investigation of the killings in washington 
sen christopher dodd dconn warned sunday that us aid to el 
salvador could be curtailed if cristiani cannot control rightwing 
death squads from operating in the country 
there was virtually no gunfire in the capital as troops regained 
control of the workingclass districts of zacamil and metropolis on 
the north side and mejicanos in the northeast 
the guerrillas however retained their grip on parts of 
soyapango a working class suburb to the east of the capital and 
soldiers said there had been fighting throughout the day four 
helicopter gunships were rocketing the area at dusk 
around the capital army patrols moved through the shattered 
streets strewn with the rubble of fighting on some streets 
several burned bodies could be seen 
later sunday security troops raided a small church in the 
capital haboring refugees from the fighting 
a military news release gave a tentative count of nearly 1000 
soldiers and guerrillas killed since the rebels launched their 
nationwide offensive nov 11 
the military said 784 guerrillas were killed 527 wounded and 
129 captured and government forces lost 208 killed and 627 wounded 
radio venceremos the farabundo marti national liberation 
fronts clandestine radio station claimed 827 soldiers were killed 
or wounded but gave no breakdown 
neither side gave an estimate of casualties among civilians who 
suffered heavily in the blockbyblock fighting the red cross said 
an estimate was difficult because many bodies are still in the 
streets 
about 800 mourners gathered for the burial of six jesuit 
priests their cook and her teenage daughter who were slain 
thursday and their bodies mutilated cristiani and us ambassador 
william walker was among those who attended the funeral mass 
rivera damas said before the service that there exists the 
vehement presumption that the murders were committed by members of 
the armed forces or people in intimate connivance with them 
later in his regular sunday homily rivera damas called the 
rebel offensive useless and unjustifiable and said the military 
response was excessive 
he said with the guerrilla withdrawal a dreadful wave of 
revenge repression and witch hunting may follow 
rivera damas was asked about a letter sent by attorney general 
mauricio colorado to pope john paul ii asking that some bishops be 
removed from el salvador for their own safety colorado claimed the 
bishops were fomenting violence 
the archbishop said he did not have the text of the letter 
which was published by sunday newspapers but added certainly i 
have received some terse threats 
colorado said he sent the letter as a private citizen he 
mentioned no names in the letter but told reporters sunday that he 
was referring to rivera damas and auxiliary bishop gregorio rosa 
chavez colorado claimed he had information confirming there is a 
plan to attempt against the lives of these church dignataries 
they could be assassinated by any resentful person colorado 
said 
monsignor rosa chavez has participated even his brothers are 
part of the guerrillas which is known by everyone and monsignor 
rivera damas have expressed some controversial and very

rebels trying to topple afghanistans sovietbacked regime the los 
angeles times reported sunday

the bush administration has already received congressional 
approval for 280 million in us aid to the rebels through 
february and the sources said the rest of the funds will come from 
saudi arabia

afghanistan the soviets and the cubans have provided new aid to 
nicaraguas sandinista government both directly and indirectly 
the sandinistas in turn have aided leftist rebels in el salvador 
where civil war erupted again this month 
whatever is happening inside the soviet union or eastern 
europe they the soviets are not lowering their profile in 
regional conflicts said a source described as close to the 
issue the administration feels it has to be in a position to 
keep up the pressure

east german communist party chief egon krenz 
opened his new home to state television sunday giving an interview 
after his familys breakfast 
it was an unprecedented action by an east german leader to 
improve his and the partys image 
in the interview broadcast sunday night krenz said it was 
possible he would be removed as party leader at the special party 
congress next month 
it is a decision of my party and ive always respected the 
decisions of my party krenz said naturally i want to fight 
for the changes weve managed so far but if the party is of 
another opinion then they should find another general secretary 
the congress is to be held dec 1517 
krenz said the partys main problem was that for 40 years it 
had not been able to pull itself away from stalinism 
there will be no going back to the old conditions he added 
krenz 52 said the communist party is moving away from an 
exclusive housing complex that had been reserved for top 
functionaries 
the television showed krenzs groundfloor brown concrete home

after assuming the party leadership from hardliner erich honecker 
on oct 18 
he said other members of the partys ruling politburo were 
moving out of the exclusive wandlitz complex 
abolition of privileges for party officials has been a frequent 
demand of east german demonstrators 
krenzs wife was visible in one scene but her name was not given 
during the halfhour interview krenz said east germanys border 
would remain open this is the best proof of our sincerity about 
reforms 
krenz repeated his willingness to expand relations with west 
germany but said east germany will not become a colony of the west

shipyard workers have removed 1600 tons of 
steel from the ruptured exxon valdez and plan to install new plates 
to the hull of the tanker responsible for the nations worst oil 
spill officials said 
i dont think anybody has ever seen any damage like this 
before said mike blouin a worker at the national steel and 
shipbuilding co where the exxon valdez has been undergoing 
repairs for the past three months 
the ship spewed more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into 
alaskas prince william sound when it ran aground march 24 
in the past seven weeks nassco workers stripped huge steel 
plates from the bottom center section of the hull creating a 
650foot tunnel in the 987foot ship 
each of the 34inch thick steel sheets are about 44 feet wide 
and 16 feet long and weigh about 100 tons many were twisted and 
contorted in the collision and workers found at least three big 
rocks embedded into ripped sections of the hull 
workers removed the damaged plates by cutting the steel sections 
free allowing them to drop onto flatbed transport trucks parked 
under the ship 
the repairs are being done as the tanker rests on blocks about 
three feet above the dry dock floor 
workers will begin the tedious task of replacing the steel 
plates on tuesday nassco officials said 
after the center section has been repaired workers will begin 
removing and replacing another 900 tons of steel on the right side 
of the ships hull said dennis krumweide manager of nasscos 
structural engineering department 
another 800 tons of steel from other parts of the ship also will 
have to be removed and replaced krumweide added 
about 300 nassco employees will be working on the 30 million 
repair project and krumweide said it would be a piece of cake 
rebuilding the valdez by the beginning of july 
nassco workers built the valdez between 1985 and 1986 it weighs 
30000 tons and can hold 16 million gallons of oil 
critics of the crippled tanker have said that the oil spill 
could have been prevented if it had a double hull but nassco 
officials said exxon did not request a double hull in the original 
design or repair orders 
the valdez was towed 2500 miles from alaska to san diego for 
repairs arriving off the san diego coast on july 10

boeing co and machinists union negotiators 
spurred by an unusual move by a federal mediator agreed to a 
tentative contract sunday that could end the 47dayold strike by 
thousands of workers in nine states 
after 14 hours of talks that ended about 330 am chief boeing 
negotiator larry mckean said the production workers could be back 
on the job as early as wednesday at the worlds no 1 maker of 
passenger jets 
at this point were looking forward to a favorable vote on 
this contract and a return to normal operations he said 
this proposal is a substantial improvement over previous 
offers said tom baker president of seattlearea district lodge 
751 which represents nearly fourfifths of the boeing workers 
covered by the machinists contract 
i feel it will be ratified overwhelmingly he said despite 
repeated assertions by boeing officials that there would be no 
increase in the companys prestrike financial offer baker said 
there is more money on the table 
he would give few specifics of the new offer but said it 
improved pay medical coverage overtime requirements and the 
promotional system 
negotiators for the union were divided saying arguments for and 
against ratification would be presented when members meet to vote 
on the threeyear pact monday but most negotiators are 
recommending acceptance baker said 
im pretty sure everybody will go for it were tired of 
standing around in the rain elaine campbell one of those 
picketing in a steady rain outside a boeing jet plant in the 
seattle suburb of renton wash 
theres a lot of people out there hurting said another 
picket steve bogdun said i dont think any of us are looking to 
get rich were just looking for the old fair share of the pie 
the strike which began oct 4 brought production at boeing to 
a virtual halt delaying deliveries to airlines worldwide amid 
rising concern over aging passenger jets 
mediator doug hammond said he proposed the deal a few hours 
after talks resumed saturday for the first time in two weeks he 
said submitting his own recommendation rather than helping the two 
sides toward a settlement was an unusual and for me a rare 
step 
he said he had used that tactic only once before in his 15 years 
with the federal mediation and conciliation service 
baker and mckean praised hammonds action 
the parties were far apart on the issues and i guess what it 
took was some bold steps on the part of the mediator to bring the 
parties together baker said 
i believe that because of the meetings that weve had we 
were kind of at loggerheads i would say it was good and 
professional for him to step in and give both parties a hand 
mckean said 
justin ostro an international union vice president who is in 
charge of aerospace industry negotiations for the machinists 
attacked both the agreement and the mediators role 
this was a 3to2 vote by the union negotiating team on the 
proposal tonight and i would have to share since i am not a 
voting member the opinion of the two ostro said 
the mediator i think breached his responsibility for 
neutrality he added he proposed an offer at 4 pm today 
saturday without the opportunity of negotiating or changing or 
amending that offer and it failed to address the workers major 
issues which were general wage increases 
in contracts in 1983 and 1986 the machinists accepted annual 
productivity bonuses instead of wage increases this year with 
boeing riding years of record profits and orders for jets 
stretching into the late 1990s wage gains were a top union 
priority 
the machinists represent 43300 workers in the seattle area 
12000 in wichita kan 1700 in portland ore and a few hundred 
others at scattered sites in california hawaii utah wyoming 
montana north dakota and other states kansas however is a 
righttowork state and 3500 to 4000 of the boeing workers there 
do not belong to the union 
probably more than 50000 workers were on strike but the 
precise number was not known because some union members crossed 
picket lines and some nonmembers stayed out 
paul nisbet an analyst with prudentialbache securities in new 
york said earlier that he thought both sides probably felt 
increasing pressure to settle 
the pressure could have come from government agencies worried 
about the inflationary effects of high wage demands the fallout 
from the strike on military contractors around the country and the 
effects on the nations trade balance from a halt in production at 
such a major exporter nisbet said

east germanys foreign minister was quoted as 
saying in an interview published sunday that his country wants to 
improve ties with israel and may discuss reparations to nazi 
victims 
it is obvious that we want an improvement the daily haaretz 
quoted the official oskar fischer as saying he added that east 
germany intended to deal with the subject and advance it he 
did not elaborate 
israel has never had formal contacts with east germany because 
of its denial of responsibility for the nazi germanys crimes six 
million jews were murdered in the nazi holocaust during in world 
war ii 
israel signed a reparations accord with west germany in 1956 and 
established diplomatic relations with that country in 1965 
referring to the reparations issue fischer said this is of 
course one of the subjects that we would have to discuss but this 
is not an issue for newspaper statements 
fischers statements to haaretz were also carried by the 
official east german news agency adn 
on the prospect of german reunification which has raised fears 
and bitter memories in israel fischer was quoted as saying 
the israelis should not be worried reunification of germany 
will never happen 
the two german countries may come closer to each other and we 
are interested in that of course fischer was quoted as saying 
but relations between them will develop as between two sovereign 
states the german democratic republic remains a sovereign country 
and there can be no argument about it

congress made little headway in whittling down 
a pile of troublesome budget health and other bills in a rare 
sunday session as members aimed their sights at adjourning for the 
year before thanksgiving 
like school children with bad work habits lawmakers saved some 
of their most intractable problems for the end of this years 
session predictably they ran into difficulties 
housesenate negotiators who on saturday announced an agreement 
repealing medicare benefits for elderly people with lengthy 
illnesses met again sunday to consider retaining parts of the 
program 
the house voted 34957 sunday evening to completely eliminate 
the socalled catastrophic care benefits including the unpopular 
tax on the elderly that finances the program but the senate 
rejected a total repeal on a voice vote 
a separate deficitreduction bill also agreed to saturday by 
bargainers from the two chambers ran into problems as well some 
legislators complained it failed to achieve the 14 billion in 
savings president bush has demanded 
its not good enough to reach the 14 billion that everybody 
says we ought to reach complained sen pete domenici rnm 
ranking republican on the budget committee emerging from a meeting 
of gop senate leaders and white house officials 
all of us recognize we have some concerns said house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif after a session attended 
by top congressional democrats 
confusion reigned about the effect the measure would have on 
this years federal shortfall which congressional budget experts 
think will reach about 141 billion 
what appeared certain was that the measure would raise 53 
billion in new tax revenues and include billions of dollars in 
savings gimmicks such as not counting the moneylosing postal 
services budget 
all parties seemed to agree extra savings would be earned by 
keeping the grammrudman deficitreduction laws cuts in federal 
programs which started oct 1 in effect until january or later 
yet another hot issue was dumped into congress lap sunday when 
bush vetoed the 146 billion foreign aid bill citing funds for a 
united nations agency that conservatives say supports forced 
abortions in china 
the house planned to consider a new version of the bill on 
monday efforts were expected to add language dealing with aid to 
el salvador which is reeling from renewed fighting in its ongoing 
civil war 
according to congressional records the session was only the 
13th time the senate has met on a sunday the first occurred march 
3 1861 when 20 votes were taken on the issue of slavery 
incomplete records showed the house had met on four other sundays 
since 1978 
there appeared to be few lawmakers in the capitol as the house 
and senate were gaveled to business at 1 pm some of those who 
appeared in either chamber appeared frustrated that there was 
little floor work to do 
wheres the senate sen trent lott rmiss asked a nearly 
empty chamber wheres the action 
in the first burst of substantive business the house by voice 
vote sent the 286 billion defense bill for the new fiscal year to 
bush for his signature the measure cuts 11 billion from bushs 
49 billion fiscal 1990 proposal for the star wars antimissile 
program the first reduction in the programs funds in six years 
but closeddoor strategy sessions and bargaining among 
congressional leaders dominated the days beginning 
some of those talks involved legislation enacted last year with 
bipartisan support extending medicare coverage to victims of 
longterm illnesses to cover their doctor and hospital bills the 
measure provided coverage to 33 million americans 
many senior citizens have complained about the way the program 
was paid for annual surtaxes reaching 800 this year for the 40 
percent of the elderly who are the most welloff 
the house voted earlier this year to repeal the entire program 
the senate chose to leave reimbursement of hospital costs and other 
minor provisions in place after weeks of bargaining senate 
negotiators accepted the house position early saturday 
the chief sponsor of the senate version sen john mccain 
rariz threatened procedural delays to try to block enactment of 
the repeal legislation

genetic tests on a 10yearold girl who 
has been at the center of a babyswap controversy prove she is the 
child of the couple who claim her and not the man who raised her 
attorneys for both sides said sunday 
john blakely attorney for ernest and regina twigg said the 
tests give a 999 percent certainty that kimberly michelle mays is 
the daughter of the twiggs and not of robert mays and his late wife 
todays the day that ends the guessing blakely said at a 
meeting in his clearwater office attended by the twiggs and their 
seven other children age 6 to 21 
the couple say kimberly was switched with another child at a 
florida maternity hospital shortly after birth the girl the twiggs 
named arlena and raised as their own died last year 
after learning the test results mays sat quietly for a few 
moments then asked for the location of arlenas grave in 
pennsylvania his attorney arthur ginsburg said at a news 
conference in sarasota 
certainly he was prepared for this ginsburg said it was 
pretty clear there was a heavy probability this was true i think 
he was hoping against hope that wasnt the case 
ginsburg said he had doublechecked the test results 
theres no question that this child is the child of ernest and 
regina twigg and there is no question that the child that died was 
bob mays child the attorney said 
mays who was in seclusion sunday plans to spend some days 
alone with kimberly ginsburg said 
i think the tack he will take is dont worry im still 
going to be your daddy ginsburg said 
mays agreed to genetic testing only after the twiggs promised 
not to seek custody of the hazeleyed fifthgrader if she turned 
out to be their biological daughter under the agreement the 
twiggs retain the option to seek visitation rights 
but ginsburg said sunday that mays may seek to block the twiggs 
visitation rights if psychologists determine it would be too 
traumatic for the girl mrs twigg said she and her husband may 
exchange letters and scrapbooks with kimberly before meeting in 
person 
the twiggs began their fight last year after learning through 
genetic tests that the girl they raised as their own arlena twigg 
was not their biological daughter she died of a heart defect in 
1988 never knowing about the questions raised the twiggs said a 
blood test before her death revealed arlena was not related to 
either of them 
a lab report from johns hopkins university in baltimore said 
eight different genetic tests concur that kimberly is not related 
to robert mays or the parents of his deceased wife 
blakely said it is not known when the couple will have their 
first meeting with the girl also visitation schedules have not 
been finalized and the pact must still be approved by a sarasota 
circuit court judge 
were very anxious to see her said mrs twigg on sunday 
blakley said he learned the test results friday but did not go 
public immediately to give mays a chance to talk with kimberly in 
private 
ernest and regina twigg moved from langhorne pa to sebring 
this fall to be closer to the girl they had moved from florida to 
pennsylvania two years ago in part to seek medical treatment for 
arlena 
mays a sarasota roofing contractor agreed for himself and 
kimberly to give blood samples after the twiggs pledged not to seek 
custody 
mays first wife barbara died in 1981 
the twiggs have sued hardee memorial hospital in us district 
court in tampa claiming employees at the wauchula hospital 
switched their baby shortly after birth for arlena who was sickly 
even as a newborn the only other white girl born at hardee about 
the same time in late 1978 was kimberly 
in the federal suit filed by blakely the twiggs claimed the 
switch occurred through negligence medical malpractice or 
deliberate acts blakely said it would be up to a jury to decide 
how the mistake was made

new england telephone co workers voted late 
sunday to accept a new contract and end a 15weekold strike 
officials for the international brotherhood of electrical 
workers said the unions members will return to their jobs monday 
at new england telephone co 
we are very pleased that our employees have ratified the 
contract company spkesman peter cronin said late sunday the 
contract vote was held at union locals in new hampshire vermont 
rhode island massachusetts and maine with the results being 
tallied in maine 
about 18000 ibew workers have been on strike since aug 6 
against new england telephone a subsidiary of nynex corp 
about 40000 nynex workers in new york also have been on strike 
but talks broke off this weekend between the phone company and the 
communications workers of america which represents the new york 
employees 
nynex had resolved the larger regional issues with the unions 
last week covering wages and benefits but the unions then had to 
negotiate local contract issues 
at first official count striking ibew members voted 71 in 
favor of both regional and local packages said george nadeau 
chairman of the t6 council in maine the administrative branch of 
the ten regional locals 
both have been accepted on a comfortable margin said nadeau 
following the final tally sunday night 
on saturday negotiators for new england telephone and the ibew 
announced they would send out for ratification a proposed contract 
covering both the regional nynex and local agreements 
but union officials in boston opposed the move saying they were 
unhappy with the proposed settlement of local issues 
dennis banks a business agent for the ibew in boston said he 
had hoped the union membership would reject the plan 
a key dispute with new england telephone was the companys use 
of outside contractors to perform certain jobs as part of the 
local negotiations union officials wanted the company to end this 
practice or at least put a cap on it banks said 
but he said the union could not get new england telephone to 
change its position

most voters in 13 southern 
provinces and nine cities rejected the governments plan for a 
regional autonomous administration officials reported monday 
they said the proposal was winning approval in only three 
provinces 
sundays election was to determine what areas wanted to join an 
autonomous government proposed by president corazon aquinos 
administration to satisfy moslem demands for selfrule and end 
their rebellion 
some politicians said the overwhelming rejection by a majority 
of the voters would strengthen the position of moslem rebel moro 
national liberation front which opposed the plan southern 
christian leaders also had rejected the proposal 
critics said the outcome was a severe blow to mrs aquino who 
promoted the autonomy plan but then declined to say if she was for 
or against it 
radio and television stations reported that up to 90 percent of 
the electorate in some districts voted against the plan 
they said the election generally was peaceful 
ballot counting was delayed by a power failure in zamboanga the 
election commissions regional center for compiling results final 
tallies were not expected for several days 
a commission official said the proposal was ahead in the 
predominantly moslem provinces of tawitawi sulu and lanao del sur 
political observers have said if autonomy us accepted only in 
scattered moslem areas the new administration would not be 
economically viable 
the regions 4 million moslems form a majority in only five 
provinces which are geographically separated and are among the 
nations poorest christians form the majority in the provinces of 
mindanao and other southern islands 
the supreme court ruled any province or city where a majority of 
the voters approve the plan will join the autonomous government 
even if only one jusidiction approves the court said the issue was 
not whether to approve the concept of an autonomous govermnent but 
only to decide whether to join one 
the congress approved the autonomy act in july 
the moslem rebel leader vowed to keep fighting regardless of the 
outcome 
moslem insurgents raided 10 villages in maguindanao province and 
scattered violence was reported elsewhere sunday but military 
authorities declared the balloting more peaceful than most 
observers had predicted 
the voting has gone through and there was no major disturbance 
that we experienced said maj hermogenes esperon spokesman of 
the southern command 
he reported clashes with communist guerrillas in three different 
places on mindanao island but said that is normal here and 
unrelated to balloting 
in zamboanga a largely christian city 560 miles south of 
manila troops guarded polling stations and armed foot patrols were 
seen throughout the city 
mrs aquino forged a ceasefire with the moslem rebels in 1986 
peace talks collapsed in may 1987 but the ceasefire generally has 
held before the moslem rebellion peaked in the mid1970s about 
50000 people were killed and thousands more fled to the nearby 
malaysian state of sabah

the name leinenkugel might cause some beer 
drinkers to raise their eyebrows more than their mugs but miller 
brewing co hopes the brand that has a loyal following in the 
midwest can do the same elsewhere 
the jacob leinenkugel brewing co a small familyrun brewery 
for more than a century in chippewa falls wis was bought in 1988 
by miller leinenkugel had developed a cult of customers in the 
upper midwest but now miller is using its muscle to test the brand 
on both coasts 
the strategy by miller the nations no 2 brewer behind 
anheuserbusch cos inc comes amid a flat period in the overall 
domestic beer market as companies have grown more experimental in 
trying to gain a bigger share 
miller really knows how to introduce new products said 
robert weinberg a beer analyst and a professor of marketing 
management at washington university in st louis if it works 
they jump on the bandwagon 
if the leinenkugel brand tickles people either because of the 
name or the taste miller could take it national overnight he 
said 
according to industry estimates leinenkugel sold nearly 100000 
barrels last year compared with national brands that sell in the 
millions 
miller a division of philip morris cos inc started testing 
the market for leinenkugel earlier this year in seattle and western 
massachusetts 
jake leinenkugel who remained an executive at the brewery after 
the buyout said miller is trying to take a lowkey approach in 
promoting the beer 
we want to go in a little mysterious a little quiet 
leinenkugel said we dont want to go in with a heavy media 
campaign we want it to be discovered 
the company is using this approach so the beer retains its 
mystique he said and part of the promotion includes a description 
of the beers heritage in western wisconsin 
it does have that local regional mystique to it said jeff 
mendel assistant director of the institute for brewing studies in 
boulder colo i dont think theyre trying to lift and 
transplant it i think theyre trying to spread it 
miller deliberately kept its name off the leinenkugel label 
i think theres a perception that a large mass producer 
cheapens the product somewhat mendel said its possible 
millers thinking they dont want that perception 
said leinenkugel there was concern at the outset about the 
company losing some of its identity after being bought by miller 
we dont want to lose that and neither do they 
jerry steinman publisher of the industry newsletter beer 
marketers insights said beer companies including miller more 
commonly have spent a lot of time and money starting a brand from 
scratch but in this case miller is taking a different approach 
they have a base of something to work on steinman said 
they know they have a brand with a reputation miller knows it 
has the marketing power to take it to a new level 
massachusetts in particular has been fertile ground for 
regional brands such as samuel adams and harpoon both based in 
boston 
theres more and more local brands mendel said its 
going to be a tough nut for leinenkugel they will have to rely on 
their upper midwest roots because in massachusetts theres 
already a number of local brands

the depressed local economy to some extent aggravated the 
banks existing weaknesses said herrmann senior deputy

westinghouse electric corp is proposing big 
increases in the fees it receives from the us department of 
energy for managing nuclear weapons plants 
westinghouse officials said they want two to three times more 
for managing three nuclear weapons facilities and three other doe 
nuclear units the weapons facilities are savannah river in south 
carolina fernald near cincinnati and the hanford nuclear 
reservation near richland wash 
the pittsburghbased company earned about 39 million in award 
fees this year which are based on the companys performance in 
operating the plants it estimates it will earn up to 50 million 
in fiscal 1990 under existing contracts 
william m jacobi vice president in charge of westinghouses 
governmental business operations said the company seeks the higher 
fees because of risks were seeing now that we didnt see 
before 
operating the plants he said is more of a highprofile 
activity than it was when westinghouse took over its first doe 
facility in 1982 since then the plants have become the target of 
citizen and environmental groups which have questioned the plants 
safety and disposal of nuclear waste 
there is a much higher potential for some event happening that 
could damage the corporate reputation jacboi said we worry 
about it quite a bit 
westinghouse expects some members of congress to oppose fee 
hikes but energy secretary james d watkins said last month that 
contractors should receive greater incentives because of increasing 
accountability and risk

promises 
iacocca told the union in a letter friday that he wouldnt 
attend this years meeting of 200 company managers and local uaw 
leaders in louisville chrysler sources told the detroit news on

plant in detroit a move expected to force the layoff of 1700 
workers 
chrysler has blamed poor sales of the aging models for the 
plants scheduled feb 2 closing uaw leaders said the move means 
the automaker is reneging on national and local contract guarantees 
to operate the plant until construction is completed on nearby 
replacement facility sometime in 1991 
iacocca said he has to miss the nov 29 meeting because of 
previous commitments not because of the jefferson assembly

we thought hed wiggle out of it said bob pearson a uaw 
committeeman at jefferson assembly he doesnt want to face us 
chrysler vice chairman gerald greenwald and chrysler motors

to pressure chrysler to keep the jefferson plant open possible 
actions include a demonstration at company headquarters and local 
strikes 
chrysler said it will begin recalling workers in the fall of 
1991 for training at the new plant

china has moved to bail out foreign auto ventures 
suffering from low production and large stockpiles resulting from a 
government austerity program the official china daily said sunday 
the report said the peoples bank of china and the industrial 
and commercial bank have provided large loans to enable the 
government to buy stockpiled volkswagens chrysler corp jeeps and 
peugeots produced in china 
the loans to rescue the highprofile joint ventures are the 
latest crack in the governments yearold austerity program which 
was designed to cool off the overheated economy by sharply reducing 
credit and slashing public spending 
with industrial output value falling in october in the first 
decline in a decade and fears of a recession growing the 
government has begun to pour huge amounts of money into failing 
state enterprises it also has had to provide large loans to local 
banks lacking funds to pay for this years grain harvest 
the daily quoting xu bingjin an official in charge of auto 
ventures in the state planning commission said so far the 
government had bought 1500 santanas produced in volkswagens 
shanghai plant 500 jeep cherokees from the beijing jeep corp and 
800 peugeots from the french companys joint venture in canton 
the government said it will later sell the cars to domestic 
buyers mainly public offices deemed to be in urgent need of 
vehicles 
the santana jeep and peugeot models together with volkswagen 
audis produced in the northeastern city of changchun are the only 
passenger vehicles made in china 
all have been hit by the austerity program that has imposed 
stiff luxury taxes on vehicles banned most public institutes from 
buying new cars and made it more difficult to import parts needed 
for assembly plants 
volkswagen which will produce about 15000 santanas this year 
almost all for the domestic chinese market reportedly has a 
stockpile of 3000 vehicles and is operating at only 50 percent 
capacity 
the government apparently is helping the automakers out of 
concern that their troubles would add to the negative image of 
chinas investment climate which has suffered since the bloody 
military suppression of prodemocracy dissent in june 
xu said the government loosened controls on car consumption last 
month to ease the burden on the joint ventures 
chinas tight budget and control of luxury consumption does 
not mean china will close its door to the outside world he 
said adding that china wants to create a better environment for 
foreign investors 
the government in 1986 came to the rescue of beijing jeep then 
a partnership that included the former american motors corp after 
the celebrated sinous joint venture was forced to shut down 
because it lacked the foreign currency to import needed parts 
xu also criticized the french government for withholding loans 
for a new joint venture agreed upon in august between the no 2 
automobile factory in hubei province and frances citroen 
frances failure to provide the loan has brought heavy losses to 
china xu said 
if the french government continues to delay the loan we would 
not rule out the possibility of looking for new foreign partners 
for the joint venture he said 
the project which calls for initial production of 150000 cars 
and 200000 engines annually when the plant opens in 1993 was to 
be financed with 11 billion and would be chinas biggest project 
ever in its mechanical industry

the air force had hoped to present president 
reagan with a new air force one in time to take him on his 
thanksgiving vacation last year but the hightech jet probably 
wont be ready before mid1990 various sources say 
we had hoped it would be done by the end of president reagans 
term but of course its not even close air force spokesman lt 
col darrell hayes said in an interview last week 
design problems and cost overruns are delaying the new 747 and a 
backup twin being constructed by boeing military airplanes co in 
wichita kan congress approved funds to replace the two vintage 
boeing 707s that now ferry the president his staff and media 
the oldest of the two 707s entered the presidential fleet oct 
12 1962 the second plane was delivered to the air force aug 4 
1972 
problems with wiring forced the initial delay in the 
replacements hayes said 
besides being crammed with antennas televisions computers 
cryptography equipment and an antimissile system the plane is 
designed to serve the presidents communications needs at any point 
around the globe with hardened gear which would not be 
affected by the electronic waves generated by a nuclear blast 
the increased requirements for the plane means it needs twice as 
much wiring as a normal 747 hayes said 
the design for the wiring didnt work they had to rip it out 
and start all over again said a congressional source familiar 
with the planes progress but who spoke on condition of anonymity 
additional delays came from a new federal aviation 
administration directive for a fire suppression system in 
certain areas of the plane said boeing spokesman pete dakan 
the work had to be done at some time so we decided to make 
the adjustment now rather than bringing it back later to adjust 
the system dakan said 
settling on a new delivery date also has been complicated by the 
machinists strike that has plagued boeing hayes said 
but dakan said work is still going on and that the plane is 
undergoing the first of its ground tests such as turning on its 
lights 
it looks fine he said 
although neither the air force spokesman nor dakan said they 
could predict a new delivery date a white house official speaking 
privately said the first plane is not expected before mid1990 
the second is supposed to be delivered sixtoeight months after 
the first said hayes 
as the delays have grown so have the costs 
boeing was awarded a fixedprice contract of 2498 million for 
the twin 747s in the summer of 1986 
asked about a report that the costs have skyrocketed to 650 
million from the original price dakan derided the figure as an 
air force estimate 
at any rate he said boeing must bear the brunt of cost 
overruns and pay for anything outside the contract 
the air force has said the new plane will have a 
stateoftheart emergency medical facility special work and rest 
areas for the president and his staff the secret service and the 
media 
the new planes which have 4000 squarefoot interiors will be 
able to fly more than 7000 miles nonstop and thus avoid refueling 
stops that now force the president to land in spots like guam or 
anchorage on longdistance trips 
instead of the 400 passengers that usually are carried aboard a 
747 the new planes will be outfitted to carry about 70 passengers 
and a crew of 23 the present planes carry 59 passengers and a crew 
of 10 
the term air force one is actually a radio call signal applied 
to any airplane that is carrying a president but the term has 
become synonymous with the two boeing 707s that are maintained at 
andrews air force base md by the 89th military airlift wing

former ohio financier marvin warner 
agreed sunday to drop a bid to modify a 16 million settlement of 
his personal bankruptcy case after his proposed change was 
immediately rejected by a creditors committee 
warner had offered sunday to increase the settlement to 175 
million on the condition he be allowed to pursue lawsuits against 
the accounting firms grant thornton and arthur anderson amp co which 
had audited warners failed home state savings bank in cincinnati 
under the original plan all litigation would be settled 
warners attorneys agreed to drop the modifications after 
creditors refused to allow the case to be tied up in further 
lawsuits 
james post an attorney for the committee said warners 
proposed change amounted to him reneging on the settlement 
by the end of the hearing warner agreed to deposit 10 million 
with creditors before dec 4 and have the case be converted from 
its current chapter 11 status to a chapter 7 liquidation if he 
doesnt come up with the money post said 
us bankruptcy judge george proctor said it would be impossible 
sunday to formally approve the plan and scheduled further hearings 
for dec 3 in jacksonville and dec 4 in orlando 
earlier sunday warner said he was justified in suing the 
accounting firms that monitored home state which warner owned 
before it collapsed in 1985 
another kink in the settlement developed wednesday when a 
threejudge panel of the 1st ohio district court of appeals tossed 
out warners criminal convictions stemming from the home state 
collapse 
warner filed for protection from creditors in october 1987 under 
federal bankruptcy law to halt 4 billion worth of claims against 
him 
in september warner and his attorneys announced they had 
reached a settlement of the claims under which warner would pay 16 
million 
warner 70 who lives in ocala was supposed to sign and deliver 
documents before wednesday stating his agreement to put a total of 
16 million into his estate to pay off creditors under the 
agreement the state of ohio would receive about 8 million 
but warner never delivered the documents and failed to deposit 
the funds required in the agreement according to a motion filed 
thursday in bankruptcy court 
meanwhile in ohio prosecutors said they will ask the state 
supreme court to reinstate warners conviction 
a hamilton county common pleas court jury convicted warner in 
march 1987 on charges resulting from home states collapse warner 
was sentenced to 3 years in prison 
ohio has spent 56 million prosecuting the case against warner 
and has made provisions to recover about 135 million as 
reimbursement for protecting home states depositors according to 
ohio attorney general anthony celebrezze jr 
home state had about 14 billion in assets and served about 
92000 depositors it was sold and reopened in june 1985 
home states collapse caused a crisis for 69 other ohio savings 
and loans whose deposits were insured by the ohio deposit guarantee 
fund
