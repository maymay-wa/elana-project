officials of island park home village of us 
sen alfonse m damato rigged the distribution of federally 
subsidized homes in the early 1980s to keep out blacks according to 
a published report 
the new york times in its thursday editions reported that an 
audit by the department of housing and urban development indicates 
that one person who received preferential treatment was damatos 
cousin anthony ciccimarro 
at the time damato was supervisor of the town of hempstead of 
which island park is an incorporated subdivision he was elected to 
the us senate shortly after that the newspaper said 
ciccimarro was selected to buy a 40000 hud house the times 
said 
also receiving preferential treatment was geraldine mcgann a 
village board member and a highranking hud administrator whose son 
received a 44500 house it said 
in the 1980s nassau county got enough money to build 285 houses 
for lowerincome families island park which is 97 percent white 
got enough money to build 44 homes ranging from 40000 to 64000 
the audit does not say if the people selected for the hud houses 
actually were eligible to buy them buyers included the niece of the 
village clerk the niece of a village trustee two village 
supervisors a lawyer who soon will become a village justice and the 
daughter of a village employee the newspaper said none of them are 
black 
the hud houses were supposed to be advertised in local newspapers 
so lowerincome residents especially minorities would have a 
chance to buy a home 
instead some selected residents were told in advance when the 
ads would appear and they slipped their applications under the 
village hall door before dawn the times reported 
the 1984 audit recommended disciplinary action against mrs 
mcgann and the village but no penalties 
mrs mcgann last year was promoted to regional hud administrator 
after her friend damato lobbied congress and the white house on 
her behalf the newspaper said 
when the times requested a copy of the audit mrs mcgann deleted 
the names of eight villagers including her son 
this program was a mockery said jeff pless who did the 
audit it took everyones tax money and gave it to the people who 
didnt need it

a federal appeals court wednesday restored 
the injunction prohibiting the us bureau of land management from 
selling oldgrowth timber around northern spotted owl nests in 
western oregon 
acting on an appeal brought by the portland audubon society and 
other environmental groups the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
without comment restored the yearold injunction lifted last month 
by a federal judge 
the action was praised by environmentalists who contend the 
spotted owl will become extinct unless the ancient forests where it 
lives and hunts are preserved 
the timber industry contends that thousands of jobs will be lost 
unless logging of old growth timber on federal lands is allowed to 
continue 
the action means as much as 400 million board feet of timber a 
third of the agencys annual harvest in oregon wont be offered for 
sale said blm spokesman don smurthwaite 
five timber sales on the medford and coos bay blm districts which 
were sold during the course of the legal wrangling werent included 
in the injunction 
the action was separate from a lawsuit filed by environmentalists 
against the us forest service pending in us district court in 
seattle that stopped harvest of 1 billion board feet of timber on 
national forests in oregon and washington 
in lifting the injunction judge helen frye said the blm failed 
to consider new information in preparing its managment plans for 
spotted owls which the us fish amp wildlife service has proposed 
for listing as a threatened species

a brazilian film company beat out 
hollywood filmmakers and purchased the rights to film the life story 
of the assassinated brazilian ecologist francisco chico mendes 
jn filmes signed a 176 million contract with the chico mendes 
foundation to lease the exclusive rights to an englishportuguese 
film tv series autobiographical book and videocassette on mendes 
life producer jofre rodrigues told a news conference 
the announcement wednesday ended a twomonth contest among 
international movie companies including warner bros inc united 
artists and robert redford representing 20th century fox for the 
rights to shoot a movie about the life and death of mendes 
mendes 44 was the leader of a rubber tappers union who fought 
to save the amazon jungle from deforestation 
in december he became to many the worlds first ecological 
martyr when he was shot to death outside his modest wooden house in 
the acre state jungle town of xapuri 2700 miles northwest of rio 
authorities arrested the son of a cattle rancher in the shooting 
mendes had won a united nations award for his struggle against 
ranchers eager to clear the rain forest for grazing his death 
struck a chord worldwide 
hollywood producers rushed to the amazon with offers to buy film 
rights 
but a fourmember panel from the chico mendes foundation an 
organization made up of ecologists rubber tappers and family 
members chose brazils jn filmes on tuesday night 
we are not trying solely to make money on this project 
chicos widow ilzamar told the associated press we want to get 
news out throughout the world of who chico was what he stood for 
and the forces who tried to stop him 
panel member gilson pescador said jn was chosen because its offer 
included making a tv series a video and a book based on mendes 
life 
pescador called some of the hollywood proposals illusory but 
also noted we thought a brazilian film company would best show 
the destruction thats going on and the reality of the people of the 
region 
he declined to confirm a reported 12 million offer made this 
week by warner bros for rights to the movie alone 
the movie script to be written by brazilian author marcio de 
souza will be in english and portuguese and foreign distributors 
will be contacted to help sell the film abroad pescador said 
jose claudio padilha the designated director said filming for 
the estimated 10 million project would begin in may 1990 on 
location in xapuri plans also include filming in washington and 
miami 
pescador said nearly 400000 from the rights would go to family 
members with 400000 going to public education and health projects 
for indians and rubber tappers throughout the region 
he said ilzamar mendes would donate the remainder to the rubber 
tappers union and other such organizations in the state of acre he 
said

a teacher was illegally suspended by a 
school board for refusing to wear a tie in his classroom a circuit 
judge ruled wednesday 
the ruling doesnt ensure that bill webb 46 will return to his 
point pleasant high school classroom but it undermines the mason 
county board of educations main charges in the math teachers 
firing 
if they couldnt suspend him they sure as hell couldnt fire 
him the teachers wife julie said in a telephone from the 
couples gallipolis ohio home 
her husband was en route to chicago to appear on the oprah 
winfrey show which planned a program thursday on people fired 
because of the way they dress 
the mason county board suspended webb three times last fall 
accusing him of insubordination for violating a dress code requiring 
male teachers to wear dress pants and ties 
webb whose standard classroom wardrobe consisted of blue jeans 
and cotton shirts openly challenged superintendent charles 
chambers order drawing suspensions lasting 4 11 and 30 days 
before being fired dec 19 
kanawha circuit judge charlie kings ruling set aside the 11day 
suspension meaning webb will be paid for that time said the 
teachers attorney larry kopleman 
a hearing on the firing and the 30day suspension is pending 
kopleman said webb didnt challenge the fourday suspension because 
he was paid 
king said the dress code was improperly established and that webb 
had the right to disobey rules he believed were illegal 
if you challenge a rule that is in effect unlawful its not 
insubordination said kopleman the board claimed webb should have 
worn a tie while challenging chambers order 
the superintendent didnt have the authority to unilaterally 
issue a dress code said kopleman only the board has the 
authority that was one of our premier arguments 
board member harry siders who introduced a proposal to fine 
webb said wednesday night he wasnt aware of kings decision and 
that the board had not talked about what to do if webbs appeals 
were successful 
board president emma kearns could not be reached chambers and 
board attorney diane johnson have unlisted numbers 
the next board meeting is scheduled for june 19 
the controversy began in august 1988 when the board said male 
instructors would have to wear ties a change from contracts 
teachers signed last spring webb who has worked for the mason 
county school system for 19 years and is also a farmer has spent 
his spare time working around the house and at a body shop he runs 
mrs webb said her husband will be wearing denim from top to 
bottom on the oprah winfrey program thursday 
i pressed them before he left she said i seldom press 
them but this is big time

a national republican party official resigned 
wednesday in the uproar over a memo he wrote comparing house speaker 
thomas s foleys voting record with that of a homosexual 
congressman 
president bush as described as disgusted by this entire 
incident and as considering it closed 
however democratic party chief ronald brown said the resignation 
of one staffer wasnt good enough and suggested his republican 
counterpart bushs former campaign manager lee atwater should be 
fired by the president 
mark goodin a press assistant in bushs 1988 presidential 
campaign wrote the memo and had it distributed as communications 
director of the republican national committee 
the memo which goodin said was sent out without his boss 
atwaters knowledge compared foleys voting record to that of 
liberal rep barney frank dmass the memo was titled tom foley 
out of the liberal closet 
the president was very upset said white house chief of staff 
john sununu in an interview reported in thursday editions of the new 
york times i was upset it went too far it was wrong the 
innuendo was wrong its wrong not because it damages our 
relationship with the democrats its wrong because its wrong 
its a terrible thing to happen at this time it was not 
appropriate or fair said sununu who said both he and bush had 
rebuked atwater 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush called atwater 
his 1988 campaign manager wednesday morning shortly before the 
resignation was announced atwater had telephoned foley to apologize 
tuesday night 
bushs spokesman said he was disgusted by this entire 
incident 
we consider the matter closed he added 
foley likewise commenting after a previously scheduled meeting 
with bush at the white house said the issue is closed he said 
there was no mention of it during the meeting 
earlier at the capitol foley said that on the telephone atwater 
had been deeply apologetic for any inferences of personal 
character 
he repudiated the statement and apologized i accepted 
that said foley adding that atwater promised there would be no 
more such attacks 
foley in his first full day as house speaker said any 
suggestion that he is homosexual is entirely untrue of course 
brown the chairman of the democratic national commitee said of 
goodins resignation one staffer cant take the fall for an 
entire republican political operation thats up to its knees in 
sewerstyle politics i think its fair to ask president bush if 
hell also have his handpicked party chairman lee atwater to 
resign 
the president himself has to be accountable for the activities 
of his henchman brown said in a statement 
congressional republican leaders also decried the memo and the 
strategy it seemed to represent 
senate minority leader bob dole said on the senate floor i 
would guess this is a rather deliberate effort on the part of some 
to smear tom foley on his first day as speaker i would say 
this is not politics this is garbage were disgusted by it 
dole declared to those who have now departed the republican 
national committee i say good riddance 
house minority leader robert michel rill expressed dismay 
over the memo tuesday and called both bush and atwater aides said 
michel at the white house for the meeting with bush and foley 
told reporters it was a mistake obviously from the national 
committees point of view 
he said he did not know if goodin had been asked to resign but 
said he had told atwater theres got to be some remedy for what 
took place and lee its your shot do whatever you think is 
appropriate 
goodin said in his resignation letter to atwater at no time 
did i ever intend to damage anyones reputation nonetheless the 
purpose of the memorandum has been misconstrued and in that regard 
i have no one to blame but myself 
rep tony coelho of california the secondranking house 
democrat said bush needed to take more responsibility 
theyre playing good cop bad cop coelho said before the 
resignation was announced heres a guy sent in by bush to do the 
dirty deeds and he calls and apologizes after the fact if theyre 
really upset about these tactics all they have to do is fire 
somebody 
rep mickey edwards rokla chairman of the house republican 
policy committee said i think were going to be moving rather 
strongly to make sure it stops

a muslim couple has put a price on the head 
of man acquitted of raping their daughter in her university of 
colorado dormitory room the district attorney has told the fbi 
the womans parents are prominent islamics residing in 
indonesia who apparently believe it appropriate to pay someone to 
kill 18yearold jason martinez lawyer dan caplis said in a court 
document released wednesday 
caplis told district attorney alex hunter that he compared 
martinezs plight to that of author salman rushdie who was 
sentenced to death by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini for 
writing the satanic verses 
hunter has asked the fbi to complain through diplomatic channels 
theres very little that agencies in the united states can 
do said assistant boulder district attorney bill wise its 
very difficult for any law enforcement agency to do anything other 
than keep a closer eye on mr martinez 
martinez has gone into hiding moving three times in the past 
month caplis said hes terrified basically out of his mind he 
just firmly believes that they will try to kill him the lawyer 
said 
martinez was accused of raping the woman in her dormitory room 
last october he claimed she consented to have sex with him 
prosecutors dismissed the case without filing charges the woman 
returned to indonesia earlier this year 
when martinez said he would sue the woman unless she apologized 
publicly she beat him to the punch with a lawsuit of her own 
caplis first got wind of a possible threat against his clients 
life while taking a deposition for the civil case from one of the 
womans friends a second friend confirmed the story caplis said 
the alleged murder plot came to light after caplis petitioned a 
boulder district court judge to lift a gag order in the case he 
argued that the public spotlight might help protect martinez

convicted onion field killer jimmy 
lee smith was sentenced to a 90day jail term on a drug charge 
wednesday but prosecutors dropped assault and attempted rape 
charges for lack of evidence officials said 
smith 58 pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of being under 
the influence of a banned narcotic substance said donna stuedgen 
citris municipal court clerk police said the drug was heroin 
commissioner robert c lutz sentenced smith to a 90day term to 
be served concurrent with any other terms stemming from a possible 
parole violation ms stuedgen said 
prosecutors rejected police charges of suspicion of attempted 
rape false imprisonment and heroin possession for lack of evidence 
said kim stalvey a secretary at the west covina disrict attorneys 
office 
police arrested smith late monday after a 36yearold woman 
alleged that he held her captive over the weekend the woman escaped 
and called police monday officials said 
smith still could be sent back to state prison because his arrest 
on monday violated terms of his parole in the onion field police 
killing officials said 
smith could serve up to a year even without a new conviction 
said harold w white deputy regional administrator for the state 
department of parole and community services division 
the state board of prison terms can revoke parole upon a finding 
of just cause said randall mark stewart smiths parole agent 
smith and gregory powell abducted los angeles police department 
officers ian campbell and karl hettinger in march 1963 and drove 
them to an onion field south of bakersfield 
powell killed campbell and shot at hettinger who escaped on foot 
in the darkness powell and smith were twice sentenced to death for 
the killing the sentences were overturned 
the crime and ensuing trial were recounted in joseph wambaughs 
bestselling 1973 novel the onion field which was made into a 
movie 
powell is serving a life term smith was paroled in february 1982 
after serving 19 years at soledad correctional facility 
smith was ordered back to prison in 1982 for six months after 
failing a drug test and neglecting to tell his parole officer he was 
leaving the los angeles area 
in july 1984 he was convicted of selling heroin while on parole 
and sentenced to five years he was paroled in november 1986 his 
parole was revoked twice after that 
hettinger now a supervisor on the kern county board of 
supervisors said smiths death sentence should have stood 
both of them should have been executed he said this is 
typical of a continuing pattern of violence from smith i know what 
he did to me and my partner

scientists said today they have discovered two 
highly unusual substances in old soils supporting the idea that an 
ancient comet or asteroid struck the earth and maybe killed off the 
dinosaurs 
two amino acids that are very rare on earth but abundant in some 
meteorites appear in sediments that formed around 65 million years 
ago the time of a mass extinction involving organisms from 
dinosaurs to marine plankton 
the finding is a very compelling piece of evidence that an 
extraterrestrial object struck the earth around that time said 
study coauthor jeffrey bada 
but in a recent telephone interview he said he took no stand on 
whether the impact caused the extinction 
bada and meixun zhao of the scripps institution of oceanography 
at the university of california san diego present their work in 
todays issue of the british journal nature 
an editorial accompanying the report called the findings 
intriguing but cited troubling questions about the researchers 
interpretation 
the work follows on a hypothesis proposed in 1980 that mass 
extinction occurred some 65 million years ago because a 
mountainsized object struck the earth kicking up large quantities 
of dust and igniting huge fires the dust and smoke blocked the 
suns rays and many species froze or starved as their food supply 
disappeared the hypothesis suggests 
supporters of the idea note that sediments that formed at the 
time of the mass extinction contain unusually high concentrations of 
iridium a substance rare in the earths crust but found in 
meteorites 
skeptics counter that the iridium may have been produced by 
extensive volcanic activity 
the new study found amino acids called alphaaminoisobutyric acid 
and racemic isovaline in sediments that lie close to the main 
iridiumbearing layer in stevns klint denmark 
these amino acids are extremely rare on earth and not likely to 
come from volcanoes the reseachers said in addition the ratio of 
the amounts of the two substances was comparable to that previously 
measured in a meteorite 
surprisingly the substances were not found in the same layer as 
the bulk of the iridium but only in nearby strata the researchers 
said perhaps the amino acids leaked away from the iridiumbearing 
clay they said 
but that does not explain how the amino acids could vacate the 
clay completely john cronin of the chemistry department at arizona 
state university wrote in the editorial 
the researchers also said they found greater amounts of the amino 
acids than one would expect to survive from the impact of a 
meteoritelike body they suggested that the celestial body may have 
carried unusually high amounts of the substances at least in 
comparison to its iridium content a comet might have done that 
they said 
cronin in a telephone interview said no celestial object has 
been found to meet that requirement too little is known about 
comets to know whether they could be the explanation he said 
to follow up on the new findings scientists could study 
different locales and search 65millionyearold sediments for other 
amino acids that occur in meteorites but apparently not on earth he 
said more than 50 amino acids with no known terrestrial source have 
been found in meteorites he said

tom foley says he has no appetite for becoming 
an allpowerful czar speaker but wants to use his new power as 
leader of the house to bolster the nations education system and 
arrest the growth of an underclass in america 
at the same time he concedes that under predecessor jim wright 
the democrats sometimes used their majority status to muscle aside 
the republicans he vows that wont happen under a speaker foley 
and he says he has given no thought to his new situation as 
second in the line of succession to the presidency even though his 
mother is enjoying that fact 
but the speaker of the house has never succeeded to the 
presidency and we all pray that the president has a healthy and long 
and successful administration at least for the next 3 years he 
said adding that any american who does not wish president bush well 
is no friend of the republic 
relaxed sipping a diet cola and back from reminiscing during a 
90minute oval office lunch with onetime freshman congressman bush 
foley demonstrated in an interview wednesday the style that 
propelled him into the speakership with the good will of many 
republicans 
the days of the czar speakers have long been over foley 
said recalling the tale that 19th century speaker thomas reed when 
asked by a constituent for a copy of the rules that govern the 
house sent by return mail an autographed photograph of himself 
foley rejected the view that the house is a moral swamp but 
said some politicians come to washington out of a love for political 
warfare and their every act is aimed at the next election while 
others come to govern 
he put himself among the latter and ticking off the issues that 
are dear to his heart listed education high 
im worried about the growth of the socalled underclass he 
said millions of young adults and children who are not for one 
reason or another performing in school or looking forward to an 
ability to compete in the job market 
he noted that south korean children have pulled ahead of japanese 
children and far ahead of american kids in educational achievements 
he said korean youngsters go to school for 240 days a year and 
carry two lunches one for noon one for late in the day because 
their school day is so long by contrast american children 
typically attend school only 180 days 
i think the quality of elementary and secondary education is 
going to determine more our ability to successfully compete in an 
international economy than probably anything else he said 
he said he worries about the enormous strains imposed on 
middleclass families especially those with a few children in 
college at the same time 
he has no agenda of legislation to shove through congress but he 
cited civil rights and civil liberties as important to him along 
with education and the enactment this year of congressional ethics 
legislation 
there is no foley plan he said but one idea worth examining 
might be linking some extinguishment of honoraria with some staged 
increase in salary for congress 
house members are allowed to keep 30000 a year in fees for 
giving speeches or writing most of the money comes from 
specialinterest groups and some reform suggestions propose 
eliminating such honoraria and raising congressional salaries 
but foley suggested he will be in no rush to propose a pay 
increase in view of the uproar that cause the house to kill a 
bushbacked 50 percent raise in january 
foley conceded a point to republicans saying that under wright 
i think weve pushed it sometimes to the point where while we

rep mickey edwards of oklahoma chairman of the house republican

house opponents of the bush administrations 
planned 6 billion fsx fighter deal with japan are far short of the 
votes needed to override an expected presidential veto 
a measure to restrict the deal passed the house on wednesday but 
only on a 262155 vote far less than the twothirds margin of 290 
needed to override a veto in the 435member chamber 
the administration already has agreed to develop the fighter 
jointly with japan the measure passed wednesday seeks to stipulate 
the us negotiating position in future talks on how the fsx an 
advanced version of the f16 jet fighter actually will be produced 
an identical senate resolution passed 7227 on may 16 
opponents of the deal say it amounts to a giveaway of critical 
us defense technology but the bush administration says the 
restrictive legislation would tie its hands in the talks 
before the measure was approved rep jim leach riowa warned 
that in case theres any doubt the white house will veto this 
amendment if it is passed 
the legislation would prohibit transfer to japan of critical 
american jet engine technology and bar japan from selling to third 
countries the fsx or any of the planes major subcomponents 
it also states that any agreement on coproduction of the fsx 
should guarantee that at least 40 percent of the work including 
provision of spare parts will be handled by american companies 
opponents declared that the legislation sponsored by rep terry 
l bruce dill might require renegotiation of a memorandum of 
understanding already reached with japan 
rep stephen j solarz dny chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs said the 
legislation could arguably require a renegotiation of the fsx 
agreement 
but a leading fsx opponent rep mel levine dcalif said the 
restrictions embodied in the measure are needed to hold the 
administrations feet to the fire in negotiations 
rep richard a gephardt dmo said afterward that the margin 
by which both houses passed this legislation sends a message to the 
president that we are serious about safeguarding americas trading 
rights protecting american jobs and preserving americas clear 
advantage in aerospace technology and production 
sen robert c byrd dwva who sponsored the senate version of 
the fsx legislation said it increases the leverage of executive 
branch negotiators in dealing with future coproduction of the 
plane 
i sincerely hope the president will not veto improvements in 
this project or veto increased leverage for his negotiators byrd 
said following the house vote 
the measure was adopted after the house voted 32098 to pass a 
nonbinding senseofcongress resolution expressing disapproval of 
the fsx deal in general but that vote carries no legal weight 
under the fsx deal general dynamics is to join with japans 
mitsubishi heavy industries in jointly developing and producing the 
warplane for deployment by japan in the late 1990s most of the 
general dynamics fsx work would be done at its f16 plant in fort 
worth texas 
during more than five hours of house floor debate wednesday 
opponents contended that the deal amounts to a loss of advanced 
american technology that will be used by japan to help propel its 
own aircraft industry into headtohead competition with the united 
states in the world market 
the sale of this technology represents an enormous threat to 
the health of our domestic aircraft industry said rep dan 
glickman dkan 
fsx foes also said that japan instead should have purchased off 
the shelf americanmade f16s to help offset the us trade 
deficit with japan of more than 50 billion 
supporters of the fsx said implementing the deal was important to 
maintaining usjapan defense ties and would provide about 25 
billion worth of work for american companies 
solarz told the house that he believes the agreement is very 
much in the commercial political and strategic interests of the 
united states

a decision may be announced soon by the 
agriculture department on whether to sell the soviet union some 
vegetable oil and butter at cutrate prices 
the bush administration has been under pressure to add soybean 
oil to the list of commodities eligible for the export enhancement 
program or eep so that moscow can buy the oil at subsidized prices 
corn oil and butter are also being sought for the eep arrangement 
with the soviets agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has the 
proposal under advisement although there has been some resistance 
to expand the subsidy program 
a consumer advocate rodney e leonard executive director of the 
community nutrition institute told yeutter in a may 26 letter the 
soybean industrys proposal for subsidizing oil exports would be 
patently unfair for several reasons 
soybeans are in short supply in the united states and a bumper 
harvest this fall will not change the situation food price 
inflation will remain a constant threat to american consumers 
until more normal food reserves are in place he said 
the global supply of soybean oil also is reported to be tighter 
than normal leonard said 
soybean processors argue that domestic soybean oil supplies are 
slightly at a surplus a condition they say could be eliminated by 
the soviet sale he said however domestic market conditions 
appear to be tight enough so that the us would likely need to 
import 60000 to 70000 metric tons of food oil for every 100000 
tons of soybean oil sold to the soviet union 
leonard contended that export subsidy programs for farm products 
are of doubtful value even during periods when domestic supplies 
are large 
but sen tom harkin diowa and others in congress contend that 
soybean oil should be made available to the soviet union under eep 
a program set up in 1985 to counter foreign subsidies 
harkin said last month that the soviets want to buy 200000 to 
500000 tons of us soybean oil and urged president bush to 
approve the sale under the subsidy program he also asked that corn 
oil be included 
of immediate concern harkin said are argentinas tax laws that 
allow its processors to undercut us soybean oil prices on the 
world market by more than 160 per ton 
the soviet union is a potential market for the equivalent of 1 
billion bushels of soybeans a year harkin said we need to move 
vigorously to develop that market and secure a fair share of it for 
our soybean industry 
harkin noted that current us inventories of soybean oil are at 
record level of 176 million tons and that stocks of corn oil and 
other vegetable oils also are large

the agriculture department says there are more 
jobs waiting for the class of 1989 at major agricultural colleges 
than there are graduates to fill them 
j patrick jordan administrator of the departments cooperative 
states research service said wednesday a recent informal survey 
showed another decrease in the number of agricultural graduates at 
the same time more companies are recruiting on campuses 
the telephone survey was done by purdue university west 
lafayette ind although the number of graduates is down the survey 
found an increase in the number of freshmen enrolled in agricultural 
courses 
allan d goecker assistant dean of agriculture at purdue said 
the job market has been more competitive and that both employers and 
students are making earlier commitments 
half of the 1721 undergraduates in purdues school of 
agriculture are enrolled in three departments agricultural 
economics horticulture and forestry and natural resources the 
school expects to graduate 365 seniors this year up from 355 in 
1988 goecker said 
starting salaries for purdue graduates range from 18000 to 
30000 a year with the average just over 20000 he said 
goecker is a member of a usda committee that has forecast an 
annual shortage of 4000 food and agricultural science graduates in 
the 1990s 
other schools surveyed included texas tech colorado state 
university mississippi state university university of florida 
california state university and cornell

a senior agriculture department official says 
chinas food inflation may be contributing to much of the bloody 
turmoil that has centered on beijing 
leo v mayer acting assistant secretary for economics said the 
big purchase of us wheat announced on monday a total of 185 
million metric tons helped reflect a sensitivity within china to 
this issue of access to us wheat and the need for food 
mayer in an interview aired today by usda radio said the big 
wheat purchase at us market prices even when china still 
qualified for grain under the departments price subsidy program 
was some indication of their need for additional grain during 
the current turmoil 
internally theyve had substantial increases in food prices 
mayer said i have had one chinese specialist tell me that food 
prices have gone up 30 to 40 percent in the major cities over the 
last 18 months 
mayer speculated that this rise in food prices has helped fan 
popular support of the beijing protesters

young adults have been the victims of strokes in 
recent years after traumatizing one of four main arteries supplying 
blood to the brain while performing such simple tasks as brushing 
teeth or tossing back a drink 
a 32yearold woman recently suffered a stroke after playing a 
drinking game in which she tossed back several shots of whiskey 
according to a letter published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
it was not only the alcohol but the manner in which she 
consumed it said dr richard m trosch a neurology resident at 
the yale university school of medicine and a coauthor of the 
article 
knocking back a shot of whiskey should be included among a list 
of potential strokecausing trivial traumas including old 
whiplash injuries childbirth heavy lifting and diving into water 
trosch and his colleagues reported 
we believe that bottoms up drinking as a form of trivial 
trauma caused this young womans dissection and subsequent 
stroke wrote trosch and his yale coauthors drs lawrence m 
brass and moshe hasbani 
although alcoholic intoxication has been reported as a risk 
factor for stroke the manner in which one chooses to become 
intoxicated has not 
trosch said young adults were particularly prone to damaging the 
extracranial carotid artery a major vein through which blood is 
pumped from the heart to the brain 
the young are particularly predisposed not only because they 
more often play drinking games but also because their arteries are 
a little more taut than older peoples and do not stretch trosch 
said in an interview 
known risk factors for dissection of the extracranial carotid 
artery include fibromuscular dysplasia hypertension and erdheims 
cystic medical necrosis 
the yale stroke program researchers article suggests many 
strokes might also have been caused by trivial traumas that 
frequently go undetected 
patients may consider such movements insignificant and thus not 
recall them or be too embarrassed to recount them the authors

net withdrawals from the nations savings 
institutions should continue to ease from record high levels as 
interest rates decline economists say 
the federal home loan bank board said wednesday that sampl 
customers withdrew 54 billion more than they deposited in april 
down from the records set earlier this year but still high in 
historic terms 
net withdrawals totaled 83 billion in march 92 billion in 
february and a record 108 billion in january for a total of 337 
billion so far this year 
james barth the bank boards chief economist attributed much of 
the recent outflow to thrift institutions failure to keep pace with 
rising interest rates offered by competitors such as mutual funds 
sampl analyst bert ely of alexandria va said sampl reports will 
show slower withdrawals or perhaps even a modest gain in deposits in 
may and june interest rates offered by thrifts historically lag 
behind money market funds both on the way up and on the way down 
we have reached the most recent peak in interest rates and now 
of course they are trending down were seeing a lessening of the 
ratedriven shrinkage of deposits ely said 
barth also attributed the shrinkage in april to pressure from 
regulators on overextended thrift institutions to shrink about half 
of the decline can be traced to 10 institutions four of them 
insolvent he said 
other analysts however say a loss of public confidence in sampls 
has also played a role 
barth said the april figure is better than it at first appears 
because withdrawals normally increase in that month because people 
pay federal taxes 
he said outflow was 16 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis 
down sharply from 67 billion in march and the smallest outflow 
since last september 
economist paul getman of the wefa group a consulting firm in 
bala cynwyd pa said 54 billion is still not a great number 
he noted that americans are saving more this year 58 percent of 
their income compared with 42 percent last year 
so youve got people saving more but still taking money out of 
thrift institutions thats not a vote of confidence at all he 
said

if winter wheat farmers are to get any drought 
relief aid it may not be decided until the end of the fiscal year 
sept 30 
during an informal meeting wednesday with agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter senate agriculture committee chairman patrick 
leahy dvt said he didnt want to pass legislation that would 
have to be revised later 
it seems too early to cover spring planted crops said leahy 
during the meeting which attracted 20 other senators 
we dont known whether such crops are going to be weather 
damaged to act now on springplanted crops shifts the risk of 
production almost totally to the federal government i dont think 
that is a good idea 
yeutter was critical of a bill passed last month by the house 
agriculture committee calling it a christmas tree because it 
promises relief to many crops other than winter wheat just in case 
weather later in the year damages them 
if we do develop legislative response it ought to be very 
narrowly defined and circumscribed to the people who have been 
hurt yeutter said 
yeutter pointed out that rain has been falling steadily in the 
past few weeks even to the point of causing planting delays in some 
parts of the country 
leahys committee has not yet acted on any legislation though a 
bill authored by sen bob dole rkan and one sponsored by sens 
david boren dokla and robert kerrey dneb have been introduced 
those measures would extend assistance provided under the 1988 
drought relief act to crops planted in 1988 for harvest in 1989 
mostly winter wheat 
but leahy said if you have a winter wheat bill it becomes the 
vehicle for the year and he doesnt want a measure the country 
cant afford 
he said cost estimates for any bill are suspect at this early 
date though damage to winter wheat has been estimated to be about 
1 billion 
he said he didnt want to give farmers assistance in a bill that 
would have to be taken away because of budget restraints 
but dole said he didnt see any reason to wait 
i hope we dont have to hold the midwest hostage until we see 
if there are problems in other states he said he said his bill 
is budget neutral in that it would use deficiency payments being 
saved because of higher wheat prices to pay the farmers who are 
facing losses

environmentalists say they hope the selection 
of michael deland to the presidents council on environmental 
quality will signal a revival for the advisory panel which was 
largely ignored in the reagan administration 
president bush announced wednesday he plans to nominate deland 
regional administrator in new england for the environmental 
protection agency to the threemember council and then make him its 
chairman 
the selection of deland brought praise from several environmental 
groups he has gained a reputation as a strong enforcer of 
environmental laws as the epas chief in boston 
the council advises the president on environmental matters but 
the panel languished with little money staff or power during the 
eight years of the reagan administration president reagan largely 
ignored its members 
mike deland is a first rate environmentalist and i think hes 
an outstanding choice said jay hair head of the national 
wildlife federation the bigger question is whether or not the 
president will give him both the resources and the respect in order 
to revitalize rebuild and redirect the ceq 
david gardiner of the sierra club said deland was a very strong 
environmentalist and called his selection very much a positive 
step and that he assumed that deland would not have taken the 
job if he had not had some assurances of what the ceqs authority 
would be in the white house 
the councils influence largely will be a question of staffing 
and money said gardiner in the carter administration the ceq was 
provided with professional staff that could research issues and 
brief council members who in turn had strong influence on the 
president 
under the reagan administration they the staff vanished 
said gardiner president reagan had at one time sought to abolish 
the council 
deland who has been mentioned as a possible republican 
gubernatorial candidate in massachusetts has been director of the 
epas regional office in boston since 1983 where he gained a 
reputation for aggressively pursuing polluters he sometimes was at 
odds with the agencys washington headquarters 
earlier this year he was mentioned widely as a top prospect to 
become head of the epa in the bush administration william k reilly 
was selected instead 
during last years presidential race deland added fuel to the 
bush campaigns attack on democratic opponent michael dukakis for 
failing as massachusetts governor to clean up boston harbor but 
while deland criticized dukakis for delaying the cleanup he 
acknowleged that the federal epa under the republican administration 
also shared blame when bush took reporters on a boatride through 
the polluted harbor deland refused to go along 
deland 47 whose back problems force him usually to rely on a 
wheelchair had occasional clashes with his superiors in washington 
during the reagan years as well as with thennew hampshire gov john 
sununu now white house chief of staff 
he stood his ground against opposition from epa headquarters and 
blocked the development of a shopping mall in attleboro mass 
arguing the complex would destroy environmentally important 
wetlands he clashed with sununu over a proposed development in new 
hampshires loon mountain and endorsed a moratorium on development 
on cape cod 
deland is a graduate of harvard college and boston college law 
school he worked for the president of the university of 
massachusetts on the epas legal staff and as a private consultant 
before taking the epa job in boston

rep newt gingrich of georgia who rose to 
prominence in the house with his ethics crusades against democrats 
says he wont challenge a fellow republicans right to vote in the 
house while appealing his conviction for having sex with a teenage 
girl 
gingrich the house republican whip said in an interview 
wednesday that rep donald buz lukens rohio should not have 
to give up his right to vote because his conviction involved a 
misdemeanor not a felony 
he said the conviction for contributing to the delinquency and 
unruliness of a minor is a serious offense but its a serious 
misdemeanor which will not cause lukens to lose any citizenship 
rights 
lukens faces up to six months in prison and a 1000 fine for his 
conviction 
i think the lukens case will go to the ethics committee and i 
think the republican conference will insist on it gingrich said 
but i think it is inappropriate for us to impose our judgment on 
the courts of ohio and bar lukens from voting while his conviction 
is on appeal 
lukens chief of staff bill jarrell said the congressman would 
have no response to gingrichs comments 
congressman lukens is not going to take out time and react to 
every statement that comes down the pike he said hes taking 
care of business here on capitol hill 
gingrich has insisted since his freshman term in 1980 that any 
congressman convicted of a felony should not be permitted to vote in 
the house while appealing his conviction 
he moved to expel thenrep charles diggs dmich in 1980 after 
he continued to vote following his fraud conviction and he 
threatened similar action against thenrep mario biaggi dny 
after his 1987 conviction for accepting illegal gratituties biaggi 
stopped voting after the threat 
the principle in regard to the felony convictions of biaggi and 
diggs was that if youre convicted of a felony you lose certain of 
your political rights including the right to vote gingrich said 
gingrich said his decision not to challenge lukens right to vote 
was not influenced by his frienship with the ohio congressman who 
was one of the conservative republicans who joined with gingrich to 
form the conservative opportunity society in the early 1980s 
he compared lukens case to that of rep gerry studds dmass 
who along with thenrep daniel crane rill was censured by the 
house in 1983 for sexual misconduct with teenage pages studds has 
remained in congress and is now chairman of a house subcommittee 
gingrich predicted that lukens eventually will be punished by the 
house and he suggested that a resolution of censure such as that 
imposed on studds and crane might be appropriate 
during the 1983 house debate over punishment for studds and 
crane however gingrich argued that they should be expelled from 
congress 
there is no high school or college in america where exploiting 
seducing or sleeping with students boy or girl would be punished 
with a reprimand he said in the 1983 debate the teacher would 
be fired similarly the two congressmen like a teacher must be 
fired

the senate after narrowly rejecting an attempt 
to postpone major parts of the new catastrophic health provisions of 
medicare has ordered a committee review of the program 
the aim of the finance committee review is to consider reducing 
the income tax surcharge on the elderly that pays for the new 
benefits 
sen john mccain rariz fell two votes short wednesday evening 
of attaching an amendment to separate legislation that would have 
forced a delay of at least one year in the socalled supplemental 
premium imposed this year on medicareeligible individuals to pay 
for a package of benefits that start taking effect next january 
however mccain also would have pushed back those benefits yet 
another year and opponents argued that his proposal effectively 
would have killed major parts of the program approved overwhelming 
by congress last summer it is the first major expansion of medicare 
since its creation two decades ago 
senate majority leader george mitchell seeking to head off the 
mccain attempt introduced a substitute amendment that put the 
senate on record as instructing the finance committee to look into 
reducing the surtax if it is shown that more money is being 
collected than will be needed 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas first raised 
that possibility several weeks ago but the administration as well 
as influential house leaders are on record against any tax rollback 
in debate on mccains proposal bentsen also pledged to look 
closely at ways to exempt from the catastrophic surtax those retired 
americans who have equal coverage under medigap policies that 
are paid in full or part by their former employers 
and he said he would renew efforts to attach the catastrophic 
coverage to part b of medicare thus making it voluntary part b of 
medicare the section that pays doctor bills is voluntarily taken 
by more than 95 percent of those eligible in large part because 
the federal government foots the bill for 75 percent of the costs 
although members of congress have been hit by thousands of 
letters protesting the new catastrophic program opponents of the 
mccain proposal argued that opponents still represent a tiny 
minority of the 32 million people covered by medicare 
the idea behind the financing mechanism adopted last year was 
that with huge budget deficits making it impossible to provide new 
government benefits without additional revenue to pay for them it 
was reasonable to expect that those being offered additional 
benefits be required to pay for them 
moreover framers of the program maintained it was fair for 
middle and upperincome retired americans to pay a proportionately 
larger share of the cost just as the federal tax system in general 
is pegged to a percentage of income 
the catastrophic 15 percent tax surcharge follows that principle 
except the maximum imposed on any individual this year is 800 
regardless of income 
opponents of the mccain attempt argued that an estimated 59 
percent of the 32 million medicare beneficaries do not have enough 
income to qualify for income tax and would pay only 4 a month for 
the additional coverage 
they cited congressional budget office estimates that 70 percent 
of those eligible for medicare would pay 100 or less a year in 
additional surtaxes and that only 56 percent in upper income levels 
would pay the maximum 800 tax 
the catastrophic coverage started taking effect jan 1 with 
unlimited hospitalization coverage after a onceayear 560 
deductible however a 1370 cap on outofpocket doctor bills does 
not kick in until next year and a new prescription drug benefit 
begins a threeyear phasein period in 1991 
it was those benefits beginning next january that mccain wanted 
to delay along with the surtax imposed to finance them 
prior to jan 1 medicare provided full hospital coverage for 
only 59 days a year medicare pays 80 percent of physician bills 
after a 75 annual deductible but until the new catastrophic 
provisions on doctor fees take effect there is no cap on the 
patients share

the house and senate face pressure to resolve 
their differences speedily over a longdelayed spending bill but 
the widest gulf is over one of the hottest political issues illegal 
drugs 
a bipartisan senate voiced approval wednesday for legislation 
pouring an extra 33 billion this year into veterans student loan 
and other programs the vote capping lawmakers fourth day of debate 
came more than two months after president bush asked congress for a 
22 billion version of the bill 
the house passed its own 37 billion measure on may 24 on a 
contentious partyline vote as is usual with spending legislation 
each chamber sprinkled its own bill with provisions boosting 
individual lawmakers favorite projects 
the biggest difference between the two bills is 822 million the 
house included for a host of antidrug programs majority democrats 
there inserted the money into the bill over veto threats from bush 
administration officials arguing that the spending would further 
inflate the deficit 
the senate version contains no drug monies despite public 
opinion polls indicating that illegal drugs is the preeminent 
domestic problem senate democrats heeded bushs warnings and joined 
republicans in preventing some legislators from putting drug 
spending into the bill 
massachusetts rep silvio conte ranking republican on the 
appropriations committee said he did not believe it would be 
difficult for the two houses to work out their differences over 
financing new antidrug efforts 
i think i can get the white house to compromise on something 
he told a reporter 
but one administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity insisted wednesday there was still no way bush would 
sign the final bill if any drug spending was included that was also 
the conventional wisdom among lawmakers and congressional aides 
legislators will be pressed to bargain quickly by many groups 
hoping to garner money from the bill but foremost among them will 
be the nations veterans in each houses measure there is 12 
billion for health care compensation increases and other programs 
for the nations 27 million veterans 
there is no disagreement that the coffers of the department of 
veterans affairs are running low the agency has already begun 
curtailing medical services purchases of new equipment and other 
efforts 
the two bills also contain money for the guaranteed student loan 
program forest fire fighting foster care refugee assistance 
united nations peacekeeping and other initiatives 
before they can send a compromise bill to bush for his signature 
lawmakers will have to make tradeoffs over whose pet projects 
remain in the measure 
there are many 
the house bill has provisions directing the corps of engineers to 
build a road at saylorville lake iowa allowing extra money to be 
spent on an agriculture research center in lane okla and 
temporarily blocking development of a laser device in new mexico as 
an antisatellite weapon 
the senate measure provides 75 million to replace a broken 
300foot radio telescope in west virginia supplies 73 million for 
the cleanup of the alaska oil spill and urges the government to buy 
more apples for the school lunch program 
on wednesday the senate rejected 5149 an effort by sen john 
mccain rariz to amend the bill with a provision delaying much of 
medicares new catastrophic care program for a year 
instead senators agreed to nonbinding language promising a 
future look at altering the program which imposes a surtax on the 
elderly that some have complained costs them too much

a top us drugcontrol official says efforts 
to stem the cocaine trade by eradicating crops in south america will 
not produce substantial results for years 
david westrate the drug enforcement administrations assistant 
administrator for operations offered that assessment wednesday in 
testimony before the house narcotics committee 
escalating coca cultivation and cocaine production in the andes 
has at no time been more critical nor posed as profound a threat to 
the united states and its allies westrate said 
but while progress is being made in eradication we will not 
see substantial effects for years against coca he said 
michael m skol deputy assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs said the state department is considering 
new directions in the eradication effort 
he did not spell them out but suggested they will be expensive 
money is a crucial part of the narcotics trade and 
unfortunately in this time of tight budgets money may be one of the 
most effective weapons we can muster for our antinarcotics 
programming he said 
us policy he said must consider what happens if and when we 
are successful in eradicating cocaine production what will happen 
to the peasant farmers earning their livings growing coca to the 
economies of those countries and to the governments that by wiping 
out the cocaine business will be confronted by an angry populace 
he said increased economic and military aid will be required 
skol said the governments of peru and colombia need additional 
military assistance because antidrug officials there are battling 
both guerrilla groups and wellarmed drug traffickers who 
occasionally support each other for either economic or geographic 
reasons 
in peru skol said the sendero luminoso or shining path 
guerrillas have virtually taken control of the upper huallaga 
valley a primary source for the worlds supply of coca leaf when 
the peruvian government tries to eradicate the crops there it winds 
up fighting the guerrillas as well he said 
us military assistance this year to peru is 6 million and the 
department has requested 20 million for next year skol said

prepared to send military units to panama last month in support of 
gen manuel antonio noriega if the president bush had attempted to 
oust the panamanian leader by force of arms 
us officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity made the 
assertion wednesday as the organization of american states was 
meeting in washington to discuss the situation in panama 
a top nicaraguan official disputed the allegation saying the 
sandinista government provides political and moral support for 
panama but not military aid 
the us officials said nicaraguas sandinista government was 
ready to act in panamas defense as the bush administration was 
weighing options during the tumultuous postelection period in that 
country us spokesmen at the time were refusing publicly to rule 
out any option including the use of force 
in the end bush decided to send about 2000 combat troops to 
panama but said the purpose was not to force out noriega but to 
ensure the safety of americans residing in panama bush concluded 
that diplomatic pressure on noriega was the best course to encourage 
a democratic outcome in panama 
according to the us officials nicaragua also sent panama a 
shipment of sovietmade weapons as part of the sandinista commitment 
to help noriega defend his government against possible use of us 
military force 
the officials said the sandinistas have more than 70000 
personnel under arms giving them the ability to dispatch troops 
beyond their borders without sacrificing selfdefense 
the officials said there appeared to be little doubt that the 
sandinistas were prepared to introduce their own combat troops into 
panama if the need arose 
nicaragua has emerged as panamas strongest hemispheric ally in 
the wake of the failed election process in panama last month both 
countries see themselves as victims of american military and 
economic pressures 
asked about the us allegations nicaraguan vice foreign 
minister victor hugo tinoco said nicaragua was concerned about the 
potential for us intervention in panama and elsewhere in central 
america but denied that it sent a shipment of weapons 
we knew there was movement of troops by the us toward panama 
apart from what was announced tinoco said 
in the face of that situation nicaragua felt that there was 
the possibility of an intervention in panama he said 
this possibility in turn created the possibility of a 
regional conflict and for an intervention in other central american 
countries based on an emergency situation nicaragua declared a 
state of alert for its forces thats what happened 
he said that after a few days when the us military 
intervention did not materialize the state of alert was withdrawn 
tinoco specifically denied that nicaragua sent arms to panama and 
added that sandinista authorities have not promised to send troops 
to panama in the event of an american invasion 
nicaraguas relationship with panama is limited to moral and 
political support he said

the navy faced with a declining need for 
cruisemissile engines because of armsreduction treaties wants to 
torpedo a 1978 agreement that requires it to buy 240 of the 
components annually from a michigan company 
the navys determination to end williams internationals favored 
position in supplying the engines has prompted intervention by sen 
carl levin a michigan democrat who for years has criticized the 
pentagon for waste and noncompetitive procurement practices 
the pentagon asserts the agreement with williams is illegal under 
a 1984 law authored by levin chairman of the senate oversight of 
government management subcommittee 
levin on wednesday accused the pentagon of trying to break a 
promise out of convenience rather than a concern for the law 
i think it is pure expediency and it is full out unfair 
levin said 
the outlines of the agreement were contained in correspondence 
between levin and the navy made public both by the senator and a 
washingtonbased whistleblower group the project on military 
procurement 
the agreement negotiated because the navy wanted a second source 
of f107 engines for the tomahawk cruise missile required williams 
of walled lake mich to license its technology to a competitor 
teledyne industries inc 
in return the navy agreed to buy at least 240 engines a year 
from williams plus 25 percent of any additional purchases up to 
1200 engines annually 
the agreement has no expiration date and applies to all 
government contracts for f107 engines 
the navy must contract through williams in buying engines from 
teledyne williams has been paid about 36000 for each of the 708 
engines built by teledyne according to figures provided levin by 
the navy 
in a letter to levin dated april 11 thennavy undersecretary h 
lawrence garrett iii said the agreement violated levins amendments 
to the armed services procurement act because it required the 
government to buy the engines under contracts not yet negotiated 
no contracting officer has the authority to bind the government 
to award future contracts wrote garrett who is now secretary of 
the navy 
from 1990 the navy plans to award the contracts without the 
constraints of the agreement on the basis of the best value to 
the government and the taxpayer garrett wrote 
the contract was negotiated by william parkin a consultant and a 
former navy employee garrett wrote 
parkin and the former navy engineer he bribed were given 26month 
prison terms june 2 for illegally scheming to help two companies get 
pentagon contracts 
he and stuart berlin were each fined 25000 and ordered to serve 
two years of supervised probation after their release from prison 
parkin pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed berlin to provide 
secret navy bid information that would help teledyne and hazeltine 
corp of long island ny obtain lucrative contracts to sell 
electronic equipment to the pentagon 
the associated press sought comment from the navy on the 
agreement the navys press office said wednesday it was unable to 
provide information immediately both the navy and levins office 
confirmed the existence of the garrett letter 
williams vice president for public relations david jolivette 
declined to discuss the issue on the advice of counsel saying the 
matter had not yet been resolved

an apparent mixup caused a uschartered flight to 
evacuate foreigners from beijing to be denied permission thursday to 
fly over chinese airspace and turn back an official at the us 
embassy said 
the continental airlines dc10 which left and returned to naha 
airport on the southern japanese island of okinawa apparently 
approached chinese airspace earlier than agreed upon and was forced 
to turn back the official said 
at 120 pm 1220 am edt the jet was on the runway 
preparing to take off again the official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
haruki yasuda continental airlines general manager in tokyo 
said the reason for the refusal for clearance by shanghai air 
controllers was unclear the embassy spokesman said the jet had been 
granted permission to fly through but had arrived six hours too 
early 
yasuda said the jet with a capacity for 284 passengers was 
refueled and parked at naha until the confusion was cleared up 
the us embassy and continental planned to have passengers board 
the plane during a twohour scheduled stop in beijing and then 
proceed to narita international airport outside tokyo

plans to evacuate filipinos from 
beijing were thrown into confusion today and it took a private radio 
station to unravel the mess by forcing officials to talk by 
telephone with harried diplomats in china 
the sometimes testy conversations broadcast live by radio dzmm 
were between a foreign affairs undersecretary an assistant to 
president corazon aquino officials of the staterun philippine 
airlines and filipino diplomats in beijing 
for more than a week philippine charge daffaires ariel abadilla 
and his deputy in beijing corazon tatarata said there was no need 
to evacuate some 300 filipinos in the chinese capital but 
philippine airlines and air force planes were ready at a moments 
notice officials said 
when the decision to evacuate came arrangements were not in 
place officials blamed each other 
the situation is very alarming miss tatarata told the radio 
station and she appealed for pal to send a plane to beijing today 
instead of friday 
some embassy dependents had to beg for seats aboard a singapore 
airlines flight because pal failed to come and fetch them 
you should not blame the department snapped foreign affairs 
undersecretary jose ingles clearly angry over insinuations that his 
office was not acting urgently enough on messages from beijing 
we are doing our best ingles said he then refused to talk 
further with miss tatarata saying he would deal directly only with 
abadilla 
ingles then blamed philippine airlines which he said was 
imposing unreasonable conditions 
pal according to ingles had scheduled an airbus300 to fly to 
beijing friday on condition chinese authorities guarantee there 
would be enough fuel at the airport and that the aircraft crew and 
passengers would be safe 
pal is imposing conditions over and above the ordinary 
obligation of government ingles said in the first place he 
added he could not understand why pal had canceled its regular 
weekly flights to beijing and other chinese cities 
other national carriers which had even increased flights to 
evacuate their nationals were flying in and out of the chinese 
capital without any conditions he noted 
nevertheless ingles said he instructed abadilla to obtain those 
guarantees from the chinese foreign ministry but up to now he has 
not informed us if these guarantees are forthcoming 
in a few moments a panting abadilla was on the phone he said 
chinese authorities had provided the necessary guarantees and that 
he had so reported in a telex sent ingles department a half hour 
earlier 
dzmm then let adolfo azcuna president corazon aquinos legal 
adviser and spokesman speak privately to ingles and miss tatarata 
off the air 
in a few minutes pal president dante santos came on the line and 
said a plane would leave this afternoon for beijing 
problem solved not quite we will need 14 visas for our 
crew santos said

perhaps the playbills at victor borge concerts 
should include a prominent notice in heavy black type something 
like warning laughing may be hazardous to your health 
sometimes the danishborn musician and humorist becomes alarmed 
when he glances over the footlights and sees his audience doubled 
up grimmacing clenching fists and turning blue with mirth 
thatsng and starts playing a piano interlude to give everyone a 
breather 
he sa he fears inducing heart attacksr good reason 
once after an uproarious performance in england victor borge 
returned to the stage in the silence of the empty theater to savor 
his triumph peering out at the seats he noticed a woman sitting 
motionless in the 16th row her eyes closed 
she had literally died laughing he observed ruefully 
borge may be a dane but melancholy he is not 
a smile is the shortest distance between two people and there 
is always room for a smile the 80yearold entertainer said in a 
dressing room interview 
borge will be the star attraction at a blacktie gala in his 
honor tonight at the 6800seat filene center atrap farm park in the 
virginia countryside about 20 miles west of washington 
the benefit concert which will be taped for broadcast on public 
tv stations will celebrate both borges 80th birthday last jan 3 
and the 18th anniversary of wolf trap the only national park for 
the performing arts 
borge promised to repeat some of his most beloved comedy 
routines which have delighted millions of people around the world 
for the past 60 years the piano lid will slam shut the revolving 
stool will never quite reach its correct height sheet music will 
fly and soprano marilyn mulvey will wait patiently through the 
pandemonium for her cues 
im he says because i see humor in any situae funeral of 
his father a longtime viola player with the royal danish 
philharmonic orchestra when he coaxed a smile from his grieving 
mother 
the caskes borne by his fathers fellow musicians and it was 
young vict who noticed that a short rolypoly pallbearer wore a 
silk hatat was much too small while a tall skinny musicians hat 
was arge that it covered his ears 
i said that if my father could see this now he would have died 
laughing borge recalls my mother distraught as she was at 
that moment smiled it was the first time she had smiled since my 
father died 
his mother introduced borge to the piano when he was 3 and he 
quickly gained s a prodigy but while he was studying with piano 
masters in copenhagen vienna and berlin he also was clowning in 
private musical reviews 
by his early 20s he had become a popular film and stage 
entertainer denm hope but his satiric barbs at adolf hitler and 
the nazi moveent forced him to flee to the united states in 1940 he 
became a us citizen in 1948 
in america i was received with great jubilation by no one 
he said it was strange to go into a store or a restaurant and 
nobody looked at me 
weary of a grueling schedule of musical comedy acts in new york 
hotels and movie theaters he finally scored a breakthrough in 1953 
when he mounted a hit oneman show on broadway the critics called 
him one of the funniest people in the world 
he has entertained kings presidents and prime ministers the 
first president it was lincoln no it was a buick he says when 
he is not touring world stages he visits his homes in greenwich 
conn st croix in the virgin islands and on portugals atlantic 
coast 
at 80 he feels that luck good fortune and stamina keep him 
clowning 
i never have to get up for a performance he said the 
moment i walk on the stage no matter what my mood if i have any 
regrets or feel sick or in pain all that disappears that is when 
the climax of my day occurs

former philippine president ferdinand marcos 
remained in very critical condition but his pain and fever subsided 
after emergency surgery for an abdominal infection a hospital 
spokesman said 
the 71yearold exiled leader underwent three hours of 
exploratory surgery tuesday during which doctors discovered and 
drained an abscess on his pancreas 
the abscess was suspected as a major source of the infection that 
has plagued marcos for several weeks but doctors said they could 
not be certain it was the only source 
there was some response to the treatment and the pain and the 
fever appear to have decreased eugene tiwanak assistant 
administrator of st francis medical center said wednesday 
marcos has been hospitalized since january and has been listed in 
very critical condition since may 18 when he suffered heart kidney 
and lung failure he remains on a respirator to assist his breathing 
and undergoes blood dialysis four times a week tiwanak said 
despite his ailments marcos makes his own decisions about his 
treatment and approved tuesdays surgery said his aide arturo 
aruiza 
just because he cant talk he cant breathe doesnt mean he 
cant think said aruiza 
meanwhile marcos wife imelda planned to stick to her schedule 
and sing her husbands favorite love songs at a reception sunday a 
family spokesman said the gathering is to promote an album 
featuring the former first lady and philippine vocalist imelda papin 
shes still planning to be there and she is planning to sing 
after all theyre his favorite songs said spokesman gemmo 
trinidad 
marcos has lived in exile in hawaii since being ousted in a 
popular revolt that carried corazon aquino to the philippine 
presidency in february 1986 
he and his wife are under us indictment for allegedly stealing 
more than 100 million from the philippine treasury and using it to 
buy real estate and art works in the united states 
because of marcos illness a federal judge in new york city 
severed him from the case and he will not be prosecuted unless he 
recovers 
no trial date has been set for mrs marcos who pleaded innocent 
to the charges and is free on 5 million bail

tokyo thursday while stock prices gained moderately 
the dollar closed at 14305 yen up 025 yen from wednesdays 
close of 14280 yen after opening higher at 14298 yen the us

selected issues which rose 17488 points wednesday added another 
9140 points or 027 percent closing at 3371829 
traders said japanese investors incentive to buy dollars was 
weaker thursday because of reports that the us federal reserve 
board lowered its federal funds rate a shortterm interest rate 
but japans central bank reportedly said it should keep a close 
watch on the feds move to see if the decision really reflected a 
us policy toward easier money 
many investors still feel secure enough to invest in the dollar 
and bought the currency due to uncertainties over the chinese 
situation said one dealer with a commercial bank in tokyo speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
on the stock exchange dealers said the indexs rise followed 
gains in the dow jones industrial average in new york overnight 
although trading was still directionless due to remaining 
uncertainties over china 
nomura securities analyst masahiro umemori said however that 
news about the chinese turmoil has a less negative impact on tokyo 
trading than previously 
japanese investors have little feeling of insecurity about 
developments in china plus the foreign exchange rates have also 
become stabilized and made market players feel reassured he added

the first aids vaccine tested in the united 
states on humans triggered their immune systems into action raising 
hopes that one vaccine may protect against many forms of the aids 
virus researchers said 
one top us researcher said he is optimistic enough to recommend 
wide testing of the vaccine 
we are making progress and i think we will be able to make a 
vaccine eventually said dr clifford h lane head of aids 
vaccine testing at the national institute of allergy and infectious 
diseases 
despite the encouraging results reported wednesday many 
important questions remain about whether this or any vaccine can 
keep people from catching aids 
similar vaccines have failed to prevent aids virus infections in 
chimpanzees 
the vaccine is a synthetic copy of the outer coat of hiv the 
virus that causes aids in humans the goal of such vaccines is to 
warn the bodys immune defenses about what the aids virus looks 
like then if all goes well the bodys sentinel blood cells will 
quickly zero in on the virus and kill the invader if it somehow gets 
into the bloodstream 
the initial human testing of this approach carried out on 115 
homosexual men who were not infected with aids was intended 
primarily to see if the vaccine is safe 
however lane said he will recommend that the next stage of 
testing be started to see if the vaccine actually protects people 
from aids infection in the comparison study a large group of 
people at risk of aids but not infected would randomly be given 
either the vaccine or dummy injections 
in the study those who received the vaccine produced 
microbeattacking tcells that recognized different strains of the 
aids virus lane said since the virus has mutated into many related 
forms some doctors have worried that a vaccine that works against 
one variety of the virus might be useless against others 
lanes report was one of several on potential vaccine strategies 
presented at the weeklong fifth international conference on aids 
lane said he did not think the men in the initial study received 
large enough doses of the vaccine to produce neutralizing 
antibodies probes produced by another branch of the immune system 
the socalled bcells that target viruses for destruction 
many researchers believe that for a vaccine to work it will have 
to trigger the production of such neutralizing antibodies in 
another report dr scott d putney of repligen a biotechnology 
firm in cambridge mass said his group had identified the single 
tiny region of the virus outer coat that can prompt these killing 
antibodies 
he and some other scientists believe that small fragments rather 
than the whole coat have a better chance of serving as a vaccine 
and while not sure that it will work he said im certainly more 
optimistic than i was a year ago 
other researchers are exploring a variety of other vaccine 
strategies including using killed whole viruses harmless viruses 
that carry an extra gene or two from the aids virus or synthetic 
antibodies 
scientists are trying many different possibilities because they 
do not know which immune defense has the best chance of beating the 
virus 
there are no known cases of recovery from aids so we have no 
idea of the immune parameters that are important said dr marc 
girard of the pasteur institute in paris 
some researchers are trying to create a vaccine that will protect 
monkeys from a simian version of the aids virus they believe this 
will give them important clues that can easily be adapted to a human 
aids vaccine 
researchers from the university of california davis reported 
that while a vaccine made from inactivated virus failed to keep 
monkeys from getting infected it seemed to slow down their disease 
so they lived longer 
at the new england regional primate center researchers 
vaccinated monkeys with weakened virus with somewhat different 
results while four got infected two did not suggesting that the 
vaccine might have provided at least some protection 
a french doctor also is reported to have tested at least one 
vaccine on humans

state agriculture officials are hunting for 
four hissing mousesized cockroaches that were set free by their 
owner and could breed and spread 
chloe riley manager of the critter shop pet store said a 
customer said he dumped the madagascar hissing roaches in his 
backyard fearing the state would jail him and confiscate the 
insects 
he came in and said man i was scared i let them loose i 
was afraid theyd put me in jail she said wednesday he said 
he didnt want the florida department of agriculture to hurt 
them 
ms riley would not disclose the identity of the tampa resident 
not even to state agricultural agents 
the department of agriculture last week ordered the critter shop 
to stop selling the roaches fearing if they got free they might 
multiply across the south like the flying asian cockroach 
when the asian cockroach was first discovered in 1985 spreading 
through central and south florida scientists found 250000 asian 
cockroaches per acre said phil koelher an entomologist with the 
university of florida 
the madagascar roaches which can live up to five years compared 
to the german cockroaches sixmonth lifespan are bred by zoos and 
distributed by wholesalers as food for certain reptiles and monkeys 
the exotic pet store got a shipment of 12 in january sold six 
during the first four months and the rest in two days after word 
got out they were trendy cheap to feed and easy to maintain 
now that they say these are a bad thing everybody wants to buy 
them ms riley said 
but koelher said the hissing roaches are nice pets because they 
are nice to handle easy to care for and large enough so that you 
can see them

a math teacher fired for failing to wear 
a tie to class has been vindicated in court but could face the same 
problem next year if a school board decides to ban denim and require 
neckwear 
if theyre smart theyll quit while theyre behind otherwise 
theyll get farther behind said bill webb who was suspended for 
insubordination three times and finally fired last december 
judge charlie king said wednesday the mason county board of 
education erred when it suspended the 46yearold webb king said a 
dress policy drafted by the superintendent last year was improperly 
imposed and webb had every right to ignore it 
but under the judges order a similar dress code can be put into 
effect by the school board board member harry siders who 
introduced the motion to fire webb last dec 19 said the matter 
would come up at the boards meeting june 19 
if they go on and say theyll ban any fabric made of denim i 
wont go back said webb a gallipolis ohio farmer who had 
taught across the ohio river at point pleasant high school for 19 
years 
webb was hit with three suspensions of four 11 and 30 days the 
last two without pay for challenging superintendent charles 
chambers requirement that male teachers wear dress pants and 
neckties 
after he was fired he returned to ohio to run his farm full 
time while other teachers were preparing to give final exams he 
was planting corn webb said in a telephone interview on his way to 
a chicago appearance on todays oprah winfrey show 
king ordered the board to give webb back pay for his 11day 
suspension and up to 1000 in legal costs webb didnt challenge 
the fourday suspension because he was paid 
the 30day suspension and firing still are to be addressed but 
webbs wife and lawyer believe kings action undermines the boards 
argument 
if they couldnt suspend him they sure as hell couldnt fire 
him julie webb said 
mason county school board president emma kearns was in new york 
and couldnt be reached according to someone who answered the phone 
at her point pleasant home a reporter was unable to reach chambers 
and board attorney diane johnson whose phone numbers were unlisted 
webb said he wore suits and sportcoats early in his teaching 
career to distinguish himself from his students but later opted for 
the blue jeans and cotton shirts he wore around his farm 
chambers became superintendent last summer and enacted the dress 
code three other teachers who balked at the code followed normal 
grievance procedures and lost 
king said webb and the others had a right to disobey the order 
which was unlawful because it was unilaterally imposed by the 
superintendent

president bush and top republicans say a press 
aide was solely responsible for the gop memo comparing house speaker 
thomas s foleys voting record with that of a homosexual 
congressman but democrats arent buying it 
one staffer cant take the fall for an entire republican 
political operation thats up to its knees in sewerstyle 
politics said ron brown chairman of the democratic national 
committee 
mark goodin communications director of the republican national 
committee resigned wednesday and took full blame for a memo 
comparing foleys voting record to that of liberal rep barney 
frank dmass the memo was titled tom foley out of the liberal 
closet 
goodin who worked in the press operation of bushs 1988 
campaign said in resigning that he never intended to damage 
anyones reputaion he said rnc chairman lee atwater who was 
president bushs campaign manager never knew of the document 
the white house put out word that bush was disgusted by this 
entire incident and top republicans on capitol hill hurried to 
distance themselves from it 
the president was very upset white house chief of staff john 
sununu said in an interview reported today in the new york times 
i was upset it went too far it was wrong the innuendo was 
wrong its wrong not because it damages our relationship with the 
democrats its wrong because its wrong 
its a terrible thing to happen at this time it was not 
appropriate or fair said sununu who said he and bush had rebuked 
atwater 
foley who had lunch with bush said he accepted an apology from 
atwater and considered the matter closed and in an interview 
he spoke of working to give republicans fairer treatment in the 
house 
but other democrats said goodin alone could not be responsible 
for a pattern of republican smears which democrats contend began 
during the presidential campaign and have continued with misleading 
justice department leaks about democrats 
i think its fair to ask president bush if hell also have his 
handpicked party chairman lee atwater resign brown said the 
president himself has to be accountable for the activities of his 
henchman 
rep tony coelho of california the secondranking house 
democrat accused republicans of playing good cop bad cop 
allowing bush to appear clean at the same time they were trashing 
foley 
heres a guy sent in by bush to do the dirty deeds and he 
calls and apologizes after the fact if theyre really upset about 
these tactics all they have to do is fire somebody he said 
the democrats in the house are truly bitter about the way this 
thing happened on tom foleys first day as speaker said rep 
beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic congressional 
campaign committee 
the foley hit was part of a wellconcocted strategy and i think 
its one that has backfired because they overplayed their hand 
anthony said 
he said it is time for the republicans to clean house at their 
campaign organization 
tom foleys not been damaged if anything hes been 
strengthened anthony said 
republican leaders on capitol hill expressed dismay about the 
memo from their party organization 
i was very distressed and rankled said house minority leader 
bob michel rill 
i would guess this is a rather deliberate effort on the part of 
some to smear tom foley said senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan this is garbage were disgusted by it 
foley trying to end the political rancor in the house was 
intent on maintaining a conciliatory tone toward the republicans and 
declined to discuss the memo 
in an interview he promised to avoid the kind of strongarm 
parliamentary moves that angered republicans under his predecessor 
jim wright 
i think weve pushed it sometimes to the point where while we 
were still within the rules we were making maximum use of the power 
of the majority foley said i dont think we should do that

the dollar gained against the japanese yen in tokyo 
today while stock prices rose moderately despite continuing 
uncertainties in china 
the dollar ended trading at 14310 yen up 025 yen from 
wednesdays 14280yen finish after opening higher at 14298 yen 
the us currency ranged between 14273 and 14310 yen 
masafumi koyama with the bank of tokyo said dollarbuying 
incentives were stronger than selling incentives despite an 
expectation that the united states may ease its monetary policy 
recent developments in china have a stronger impact because 
speculation over a relaxation of us monetary policy has been an 
issue for quite a while and is no longer fresh news he said 
theoretically he said the market could shift to dollar selling 
because of the narrowing interestrate gap between japan and the 
united states 
but investors are still buying the dollar which shows how 
strong their demand for the us currency is koyama said 
on the tokyo stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average 
closed the day at 3371829 gaining 9140 points or 027 percent 
the index rose 17488 points the previous day 
stocks moved higher almost across the board 
dealers attributed the gains to an uptrend begun the previous 
day as well as to overnight rises on overseas markets 
kazuyuki suzuki a dealer with daiwa securities in tokyo said 
the nikkei gained despite turmoil in china mainly because japanese 
investors buying interest was strong 
trading was thin and directionless because of the uncertainties 
in china but many investors bought cheaper issues following the 
four consecutive days of losses which ended tuesday he said 
other dealers said the markets expectation that the united 
states would relax its monetary policy also prompted buying low 
interest rates are generally good news for stock investors 
the volume traded on the markets first section was estimated at 
650 million shares up from wednesdays 600 million among the 
winners were construction and automobile issues

a drug to help treat severe cases of 
parkinsons disease a degenerative disorder of the central nervous 
system has been approved for public use 
the drug selegiline will be part of the standard therapy for 
parkinsons which uses another drug levodopa to treat the 
symptoms that include slowness of movement muscular rigidity 
instability and tremors 
levodopa after several years of use often decreases in 
effectiveness even with increased doses said the food and drug 
administration 
the drug is aimed at the 20000 to 50000 people most of whom 
are over 40 with severe parkinsons the drug previously was 
available to the most severely ill while the company making the drug 
continued to gather data on its effectiveness 
scientists believe parkinsons results from reduced levels in the 
brain of dopamine a naturally produced substance that helps 
regulate movement

thailand is concerned that the turmoil 
in china may delay the settlement of the cambodian conflict a 
foreign ministry official said today 
china is a principal player in cambodia as the main backer of the 
khmer rouge the strongest of the threeparty guerrilla coalition 
opposing the provietnamese government in phnom penh 
foreign ministry spokesman jete sucharitkhul said the thai 
government was very concerned about developments in beijing 
where prodemocracy protests since midapril escalated until troops 
shot to death hundreds of people last weekend 
usually the chinese government follows the party line if 
there is a power struggle you can imagine that they will be very 
busy internally and not be able to pay as much attention to the 
cambodian issue as they have in the past he said 
but jete said he did not think that apparant divisions in the 
chinese leadership would change chinas policy on cambodia 
i dont think there will be a shift just that they will be 
able to pay less attention to the issue but nobody can tell at the 
moment as we dont know the extent of the infighting he said 
recent peace talks have brought the various cambodia factions 
closer to a solution to the 10year war vietnam which invaded 
cambodia in 1978 has pledged to withdraw all its troops stationed 
there by sept 30 
but the major stumbling block to a peace settlement has been the 
khmer rouge who were ousted from power by the vietnamese invasion 
the khmer rouge killed as many as 1 million cambodians from 1975 
to 1978 as it violently tried to turn the country into a radical 
agrarian commune 
recent peace talks have focused on whether the khmer rouge should 
be allowed to participate in a future coalition government 
the khmer rouge announced last week that pol pot the man who 
presided over their rule wished to resign his last official post in 
the organization 
diplomats dismissed the move as a ploy to present a more 
acceptable face in future negotiations the government in phnom penh 
has insisted that pol pot and other leaders be removed before the 
khmer rouge is allowed any share of power 
there are unconfirmed reports from western diplomats in bangkok 
that the shadowy leader believed to be in his early 60s is 
currently in beijing for medical treatment

a plant that makes triggers for nuclear bombs was 
slapped with 25 state health violations the day after federal agents 
launched an inquiry into illegal dumping and burning of hazardous 
wastes at the facility 
the states action wednesday against the rocky flats nuclear 
plant was independent of the federal investigation and the timing of 
the two announcements was coincidence said tom looby assistant 
director of the colorado department of health 
the state accused the department of energy and rockwell 
international corp which operates rocky flats for doe of 
improperly storing wastes failing to monitor groundwater adequately 
and storing hazardous wastes in leaking drums 
the violations involved raised some serious questions in our 
mind about the overall ability of the department of energy and 
rockwell to manage the plant said looby 
rockwell international spokesman ed heintz said he had not seen 
the health department allegations 
but i would be surprised if there are any new violations and it 
is just a matter of interpretation whether or not the deficiencies 
are cleared up or in the process of being cleared up heintz said 
the plant 16 miles northwest of denver makes plutonium triggers 
for nuclear bombs 
agents from the fbi the us environmental protection agency and 
doe carried out search warrants there wednesday for the second day 
in a row 
the justice department said plant employees allegedly concealed 
contamination and illegally treated stored and disposed of 
hazardous and radioactive waste 
looby said the states order included a total of 24 citations for 
violation of rules for monitoring hazardous waste in groundwater 
unapproved storage of hazardous and mixed wastes leaking hazardous 
waste drums inadequate recordkeeping and personnel training and 
failure to maintain proper aisle space in waste storage areas 
no individual instance is a terribly nasty violation said 
dave shelton director of the health departments hazardous 
materials and waste management division 
the concern is that in the aggregate it shows that the 
facility has a good deal of difficulty in managing its hazardous 
waste in order to stay in compliance with state standards 
shelton said 
the order gives doe and rockwell 10 days to request a meeting to 
discuss the order the state then has a month to finalize the order 
and to set a compliance deadline for each violation the maximum 
penalty for noncompliance is 25000 per violation per day 
officials said 
rocky flats has been dogged by safety and environmental problems 
since it began operations in 1953 but particularly in recent years 
last year the energy department identified it as the most 
environmentally hazardous site in the nuclear weapons industry 
because toxic chemicals contaminate an underground reservoir and 
threaten nearby city water supplies 
in october the agency closed rocky flats main plutonium 
reprocessing building for safety violations two months later the 
agency reported 32 new safety problems at the plant 
the energy department has announced plans to close rocky flats in 
the next 20 years in a consolidation of americas nuclear weapons 
plants 
in a previous federal probe of a nuclear weapons complex in 1986 
the epa examined energy department handling of hazardous waste at 
its hanford wash reservation no criminal prosecution resulted

larger than the average lobbyist two cows called 
on the statehouse with a group of concerned dairy farmers who 
demanded higher prices for milk in massachusetts 
dairy cows jersey and simon kat quietly chewed their cuds while 
two dozen farmers and their supporters rallied on the statehouse 
steps tuesday 
the farmers said high land prices were pushing them out of 
business and threatening the states dwindling dairy industry a 
proposal in the state legislature would increase milk prices 2 cents 
per quart and the money would be distributed back to state dairy 
farmers 
its either pay now or pay more later said dave patterson of 
the 2200member agrimark new englands largest dairy cooperative 
its not a tax its a rate hike 
the farmers argue that at 212 per gallon on average the price 
of milk in massachusetts is lower than the national average 
according to the state agriculture department there were 3000 
dairy farms in massachusetts in 1960 and only 460 active farms 
today production dropped from 800 million pounds of milk in 1985 to 
about 470 million pounds last year

the canadian government has blocked efforts by 
chicagos shedd aquarium to buy three beluga whales from eskimos 
near hudson bay officials say 
the aquarium had planned to buy the whales this summer for its 
43 million oceanarium a marine mammal pavilion due to be 
opened next year 
but under pressure from environmentalists the ottawa government 
blocked the deal canadian officials gave no reason but promised to 
explain their denial by next week said aquarium spokeswoman betsy 
raymond 
however an unidentified official of the canadian ministry of 
fisheries and oceans told the chicago tribune that his agency 
doesnt think the chicago aquarium has experts on its staff who know 
how to care for belugas 
he also expressed concern that the aquariums new addition 
wouldnt be ready by the time the belugas were to be captured 
but shedds assistant director david lonsdale said the aquarium 
does have qualified staff members to care for the whales who would 
have been housed outside chicago until the oceanarium is finished 
barry kent mackay wildlife coordinator for the toronto humane 
society hailed the ministrys decision 
its a tradition for the eskimos to kill belugas and eat 
them but its not a tradition for them to sell them to the shedd 
aquarium he said 
but shedd officials contend the best way to educate the public 
about the need to protect whales is to display them in aquariums 
beluga whales are not considered an endangered species and under 
canadian law mackay said eskimos near hudson bay are allowed to 
exercise their native hunting rights to capture a half dozen or so 
whales each summer 
beluga whales are 10 to 15 feet long and resemble dolphins 
ms raymond said the aquarium will acquire three much larger and 
more plentiful pacific black whales for the new pavilion

theres no reason to believe anything was inappropriate said 
a statement released by damatos office 
preferential treatment also was accorded to geraldine mcgann a 
village board member and highranking hud administrator whose son 
daniel received a 44500 house the times said citing the audit 
mrs mcgann a friend of damato also denied any favoritism took 
place 
under a federal program to build affordable housing for 
minorities nassau county in the early 1980s received money to build 
285 houses for lowerincome families 
island park population 4200 and 97 percent white received 
enough money to build 44 homes to be sold at 40000 to 64000 hud 
proposed that 17 of the 22 houses to be built during the projects 
second phase be sold to blacks from nearby areas but none were 
twelve of the 44 hud houses have since been resold at large 
profit one went for 270000 the times said 
the audit did not say whether those selected for the hud houses 
met the programs eligibility requirements the buyers included the 
niece of the village clerk the niece of a village trustee two 
village supervisors a lawyer who is soon to become a village 
justice and the daughter of a village employee the times said 
the hud houses were supposed to be advertised in local newspapers 
to reach lowerincome buyers especially minorities 
but some residents were tipped off and by the time the ads 
appeared 22 buyers had been selected the times said 
the 1984 audit recommended disciplinary action against mrs 
mcgann and the village but neither was penalized 
mrs mcgann last year was promoted to regional hud administrator 
after damato lobbied congress and the white house on her behalf 
the times said 
a copy of the audit was mailed anonymously to the times which 
said it then requested and received a copy from hud to verify its 
authenticity 
this program was a mockery said jeff pless who did the 
audit and later quit in disgust that no action was taken it took 
everyones tax money and gave it to the people who didnt need it

assailants shot a palestinian man to death on 
his hospital bed today in the occupied west bank and arab reports 
claimed he collaborated with israel 
another suspected collaborator was shot and seriously wounded in 
a separate incident the reports said 
in the occupied gaza strip soldiers sealed the homes of three 
palestinians accused of throwing firebombs at troops 
an 18yearold palestinian also was reported wounded in the leg 
in a clash with troops in jebaliya in gaza 
the fatal attack occurred in rafidiyeh hospital in the west bank 
town of nablus where taleb yamin 55 had been convalescing from 
injuries suffered 10 days earlier in a clubbing and stabbing attack 
in nablus old city two hospital doctors said 
a group of people entered the hospital at 5 am they forced a 
male nurse and a relative to leave the room then they opened fire 
killing him instantly rafidiyehs director abdel rahman shinar 
said in a telephone interview 
another doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity said yamin 
was shot once in the head 
the army confirmed the slaying and said police were investigating 
yamin was the 49th palestinian slain by other palestinians since 
the palestinian uprising began most have been accused of helping 
israeli authorities or dealing in drugs and prostitution 
a total of 510 palestinians have been killed in the 18month 
rebellion against israeli rule most in clashes with israeli 
soldiers twentytwo israelis also have died in the unrest 
the second shooting also occurred in nablus arab assailants shot 
fayel fawalha 48 seriously wounding him in the head arab reports 
said 
fawalha was reportedly evacuated by an israeli helicopter after 
being treated by soldiers at the scene 
the army confirmed the man was shot and said troops had closed 
off nablus 
the shootings came a day after a 30yearold man was hacked to 
death in nablus with a hatchet and his naked body chained to an 
electric pole 
arab reporters said he was a collaborator the army suggested the 
motive for wednesdays slaying was criminal 
vice president dan quayle was quoted by the daily jerusalem post 
today as urging that israel put a halt to announcing new settlement 
building in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the announcements of new settlements are politically 
problematic even if they israeli leaders dont go through with 
it quayle noted 
israel has built some 130 settlements as homes for 70000 jews 
who live among 17 million palestinians in the occupied lands 
the united states has frequently criticized the settlements as an 
obstacle to peace its something that i wish there was a 
sensitivity to this said quayle 
he said the settlement issue gave critics of israel fodder for 
the cannon fire and believe me they want to unload on israel 
it makes it more problematic for those of us who are strong 
defenders of israel quayle added 
a new public opinion survey meanwhile showed 53 percent of 
israelis would object to dismantling the settlements as part of a 
peace agreement 
fortytwo percent of 579 of the israelis interviewed this week by 
the dahaf institute said they favored removing the settlements the 
yediot ahronot daily reported no margin of error for the poll was 
given 
troops maintained a curfew for a fifth day on the gaza strip 
confining more than 700000 residents to their homes indefinitely 
the restrictions were lifted for two hours in the town of khan 
yunis so residents could purchase food 
the homes sealed shut were in gazas jabaliya refugee camp one 
belonged to ibrahim arrar 24 and housed his wife and one child 
arab reports said the other suspects were not immediately 
identified 
the army said the three palestinians were suspected firebomb 
assailants and also accused them of belonging to the outlawed fatah 
guerrilla faction of the palestine liberation organization 
in a communique the army said the palestinians were accused of 
throwing several firebombs at israeli troops during april 
they are also suspected of additional activity including 
threats on those who work in israel placing roadblocks and tire 
burnings it said 
on wednesday soldiers demolished the homes of two palestinians in 
gaza who were convicted of firebomb attacks on israeli soldiers 
israel claims that house wreckings and sealings are an effective 
deterrent against attacks

more than 25 years after their game was 
canceled because of president kennedys assassination alumni from 
two rival high schools took to the gridiron to complete their last 
football season 
bowie and jefferson high schools have long had the hottest 
scholastic rivalry in el paso on the morning of nov 22 1963 the 
schools were holding pep rallies and preparing to cap their seasons 
with the annual double homecoming but an assassins bullet in 
dallas prompted officials to cancel the game 
if you beat jefferson that was it that was your season 
nothing else mattered said felipe peralta who played wide 
receiver as a bowie senior in 1963 and coached wednesday nights 
game 
i think at the time most of us thought it was important to play 
the game you dont actually complete your highschool season when 
you cant play your main rival 
alumni from the schools settled the score wednesday night with a 
spirited game of sevenman touch football before 400 spectators at 
bowie stadium the home team won 208 
the contest wasnt pretty the bowie bears threw bombs on almost 
every play and the jefferson silver foxes threw so many laterals 
that it resembled a volleyball game but that didnt bother the 
players 
it was a lot of fun said bowies rudy molinar it was just 
friends against friends 
the contest brought back memories of that fateful day 
i was excited jefferson alumnus oscar gomez recalled about 
the week leading to the canceled 1963 game then our dear 
president passed away which was terrible it was nice to get to 
play again 
the whole country was down because of the shooting but we were 
down because of the game said gomez teammate manny florez 
its a game you look forward to all year 
or look forward to for a quarter century alumni from both 
schools had talked for years about playing the canceled game last 
week bowies class of 64 which is celebrating its 25th reunion 
this week decided to stage the game those who took part were glad 
they did 
there was a piece missing from our lives when we didnt get to 
play that game peralta said

books that advocate nazism and question 
whether the holocaust occurred were on sale last week at state rep 
david dukes house says a researcher concerned that fellow 
legislators are not challenging duke 
no one is speaking out against the ideas of david duke he has 
not changed his views even though he says he has elizabeth 
rickey a tulane university graduate student and member of the 
republican state central committee said wednesday 
duke a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan was elected to 
the state legislature from a nearly allwhite district in february 
he still heads the national association for the advancement of white 
people which promotes the civil rights of whites his house serves 
as headquarters for the organization 
rickey said she was upset that some louisiana republicans had 
accepted duke 
they honestly dont know what to do with him she said 
they think if you ignore him hell go away 
rickey said she and other researchers purchased antijewish and 
extremist material from dukes house in metairie as recently as 
saturday 
among the materials rickey said she bought were 
the turner diaries described as the bible of the order a 
white supremacist organization founded by members of the national 
alliance and the aryan nations 
imperium which argues for the preservation of western 
culture through the practice of nazi racist policies 
did six million really die the truth at last which argues 
that the holocaust was grossly exaggerated to gain sympathy for a 
jewish homeland 
also available were books on breeding a master race rickey said 
duke denied that he was selling the books asked how rickey and 
her associates could buy them he said it might have been some 
old stock 
this is nothing new duke said ive sold a wide range of 
books i think people have a right to read all points of view

clergywoman from philadelphia to gain a national religious post 
recently earlier this year barbara harris became associate bishop 
of the episcopal church in massachusetts 
im proud of my sister and im proud to stand with her mrs

particularly at a time when our denominations are under such fire 
and criticism clergywomen bring a unique perspective to the 
church

clarity as to who we are as presbyterians we must neither be bland 
nor dull the church should speak out as to how christ would speak 
we must talk more about jesus she said

a landlord who agreed to rent a house to an 
unmarried couple and then reneged citing his christian values has 
been ordered to pay more than 1000 in damages and penalties 
a judge refused to treble the damages however as the law 
allows because he said the landlord acted out of sincerely held 
religious beliefs 
administrative law judge peter erickson ruled wednesday that 
layle french must pay 36850 in compensatory damages and 400 for 
mental anguish to susan parsons jenson as well as 300 in civil 
penalties to the state 
the judge ruled in march that french violated a state law 
prohibiting discrimination based on marital status by refusing to 
rent a house to jenson and her thenfiance 
french reflected upon his action prior to engaging in the 
discriminatory conduct and weighed his duties under the law against 
his religious beliefs erickson said 
frenchs argument that the discrimination statute should take a 
back seat to his christian values had attracted wide support in 
minnesota and elsewhere in the country french is a member of the 
marshall evangelical free church 
his attorney james anderson said wednesday he plans to take the 
case to the state court of appeals 
anderson said he is saddened about a man who is fighting a 
trend and that is a general moral decay of the country and the 
state has seen fit not to promote what hes doing but rather to 
promote the moral decay 
anderson said he was especially distressed at the civil penalty 
because he claimed french was upholding the state law banning 
fornication he said he had not been able to reach french to inform 
him of the ruling 
erickson noted in his decision that when french first agreed to 
rent to jenson and her thenfiance on feb 22 1988 he knew that 
the couple was not married two days later erickson noted french 
called jenson and informed her that he could not rent the property 
to her because cohabitation by two adults of the opposite sex was 
not in accord with his religious beliefs 
by that time jenson had given up her rental mobile home she 
later married her fiance

hopedale ohio ap come home clark gable all is forgiven 
twentynine years after his death the king of hollywood has 
finally won back the hearts of those who live in his hometown 
gable at least his legend will be the guest of honor this 
weekend as harrison county and some stars of gone with the wind 
commemorate the films 50th anniversary by reenacting the famous 
twelve oaks barbecue scene and attending a screening of a restored 
version of the movie 
the 850 residents of this eastern ohio village where gable was 
born feb 1 1901 havent always regarded him as a favorite son 
the gawky gaptoothed bigeared boy never returned to the county 
after he moved about 80 miles northwest to akron in 1917 
most folks around here were angry because he never came back 
said michael cope president of the clark gable foundation but 
recently were seeing a real turnaround there is no longer any of 
that resentment we felt even after we started honoring him on his 
birthday in 1984 
frances jackson an 86yearold hopedale native said she has 
forgiven gable for never returning she has become a local celebrity 
herself because she once rejected gables request for a birthday 
kiss 
he said this is my 16th birthday do you want to be the first 
one to kiss me i said no i did not mrs jackson said 
he had a real way with the girls oh he had lots and lots of 
girlfriends but not me she said smiling my father would have 
killed me 
harrison county has been celebrating gables birthday each year 
since 1984 hoping that fascination with the actor and his films 
will give a boost to an economy hurt by a decline in coal mining 
said cope who also is county treasurer the countys unemployment 
rate was 108 percent in april 
other famous native sons simply dont have the drawing power 
john bingham credited as the author of the 14th amendment to the 
constitution was born in cadiz 10 miles southwest of hopedale and 
gen george custer is better know for his last stand at little 
bighorn than his first breath in new rumley about 10 miles to the 
northwest 
a granite monument honoring gable was erected in 1986 at the site 
of his home in cadiz where his family moved when he was a child by 
coincidence the house was razed in 1960 the year gable died 
the gable foundation hopes to raise enough money through special 
events and corporate donations to build and operate a museumtheater 
to display gable memorabilia and show his films 
the threeday commemoration of the films golden anniversary 
begins friday with an auction of memorabilia at the alameda inn a 
roadhouseturnedrestaurant that gable was believed to have 
frequented in his younger days 
items to be sold include an original program from the movies 
1939 premiere a sepia movie still of gable and vivien leigh as 
rhett butler and scarlett ohara and a firstissue postage stamp 
honoring margaret mitchell author of gone with the wind signed 
by olivia de havilland who portrayed the longsuffering melanie 
wilkes 
on saturday residents and stars from the movie including fred 
crane who played one of the tarleton twins will don civil warera 
attire to reenact the barbecue scene at an american legion hall 
also during the weekend crane and other stars will be asked to 
leave hand imprints and signatures in cement they include butterfly 
mcqueen who played prissy the maid cammie king conlon who 
portrayed bonnie blue the illfated daughter of rhett and scarlett 
and patrick curtis who appeared in the film as an infant 
cope said danny selznick son of the films producer david o 
selznick plans an appearance 
the reunion of the stars ends sunday with a showing of a restored 
print of the film in wheeling wva 25 miles to the southeast

a planeload of americans arrived on a special 
evacuation flight today from chaotic beijing with stories of friends 
and children slain in the chinese capital and gunshots punctuating 
their escape to the airport 
some were greeted in japan by relieved and tearful relatives and 
staff member from the us embassy and united airlines helped some 
evacuees who had no money with loans or tickets on credit 
so many children were killed said terese james 24 of 
liberty city texas after arriving with 320 people on the united 
airlines jumbo jet that had been chartered by the us state 
department 
she said she had been teaching at the forestry university in 
northern beijing and saw many victims of the assault by chinese 
troops on prodemocracy demonstrators in tiananmen square 
one couple bicycled from tiananmen 10 kilometers back to the 
university with their 7yearold child who died they were running 
away and they mowed them down 
similar stories were being told around the world as thousands of 
foreigners left beijing on regular flights and special planes 
arranged by foreign governments 
ms james said she had to lie flat on the floor of the car taking 
her to the airport monday because there was shooting and then had 
to wait almost four days to get a flight 
the united charter flights load of 320 people included 30 
employees of occidental petroleum who escaped from a coal mine in 
central china some dependents of us diplomats and a few people of 
other nationalities 
most were to fly on to the united states immediately 
it was dreadful said the wife of a us diplomat who asked 
that her name not be used we had friends who died we used to go 
out every night to the square to talk to the people there and we 
even brought our kids nobody expected to be mowed down 
ms james said it was getting pretty dangerous for americans 
in beijing because authorities were blaming the turmoil on western 
influence 
at her university she said students piled up bodies of victims 
inside the gates to keep soldiers out of the campus and she had 
heard that soldiers stripped some bodies of identification and 
burned them 
in britain evacuee amanda ling 21 said she had been in 
tiananmen when the massacre began she said she saw a crowd drag 
away two policemen and people enraged by the shooting trying to 
destroy army vehicles 
i got really scared someone came rushing toward me and said 
go and look for yourself the chinese are shooting the chinese it 
was horrible i just didnt want to see people dying she said 
ms ling a leeds university student who had been at beijing 
foreign studies university said british embassy officials had given 
british students 10 minutes to pack 
her evacuation flight landed today at gatwick airport outside 
london

prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan ended 
talks with president bush and other us officials after winning a 
commitment for new f16 fighter sales and promising not to provoke a 
regional arms race by producing nuclear weapons 
she made the promise in an address wednesday to a joint meeting 
of congress in which she urged the united states to work 
aggressively for a broadbased political settlement in afghanistan 
and said that pakistans fledgling democracy deserves continued us 
military and economic assistance 
ms bhutto a 1974 graduate of harvard university was attending 
harvards commencement ceremonies today and addressing members of 
the harvard alumni association 
on friday she is scheduled to meet with officials of the united 
nations in new york before leaving the united states on saturday 
the f16 sale said to be worth 14 billion will give pakistan 
a total 100 of the sophisticated warplanes 
the new york times reported in todays editions that unidentified 
pakistani officials said ms bhutto had urged the united states to 
try to persuade the soviet union to accept the departure of afghan 
president najib from office with whom the guerrillas have refused 
to negotiate as a step that could lead to negotiations 
during her visit ms bhutto and secretary of state james a 
baker iii witnessed the signing of agreements providing for 465 
million to help pakistan finance housing narcotics and education 
programs 
the agreements are part of a 228 billion sixyear aid package 
designed to support pakistans economic development according to 
the agency for international development pakistan is the third 
largest recipient of us aid 
pakistanis are grateful for such assistance the prime minister 
told congress because your military assistance has helped 
maintain a relative balance in the region it has contributed to 
pakistans sense of security 
the prime ministers address was repeatedly interrupted by 
applause especially when she addressed longstanding us concerns 
that pakistan is on the verge of acquiring nuclear arms 
speaking for pakistan i can declare that we do not possess nor 
do we intend to make a nuclear device that is our policy she 
said 
we are committed to a regional approach to the nuclear problem 
and we remain ready to accept any safeguards inspection and 
verification that are applied on a nondiscriminatory regional 
basis she said 
ms bhutto said pakistan has long advocated creating a nuclear 
weaponsfree zone in south asia and added a first step in that 
direction could be a nuclear testban agreement between pakistan and 
its neighbors we are prepared for any negotiation to prevent 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons in our region 
we will not provoke a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent 
she said 
the prime minister mentioned no other country by name but 
pakistans regional rival india which detonated a nuclear device 
some 15 years ago has resisted agreeing to testban and nuclear 
weaponsfree zones unless such arrangements also include china a 
nuclearweapons state

an appeals court has upheld the firing of a radio 
station producer for airing an impersonation of thenmayor kevin 
white in 1982 
the state court said that the incident was not exactly the war 
of the worlds but that wrkoam had every right to fire paul 
yovino for inviting an impersonator on air to take calls from the 
audience as his honor 
he pretended to be the mayor although greatly exaggerating the 
mannerisms of the persona of the real mayor judge rudolph kass 
said wednesday broad as the caricature may have been the 
impersonator induced a flurry of phone calls to city hall in which 
the callers made unflattering observations about what the mayor 
was saying on the air 
upholding a lowercourt ruling the judge said yovinos failure 
to ensure that the audience knew the mayor was an impersonator 
amounted to a serious error

a blizzard of 20 bills on a highway 
stopped rushhour traffic cold and sorely tempted a man who returned 
440000 after staring for hours at a 45pound sack of cash on his 
kitchen table 
more than 500000 fell out the back of a loomis armored inc 
truck about 9 am wednesday on interstate 10 near downtown police 
said one sack broke and 20 bills littered the fourlane highway 
fbi spokesman terry kincaid said at least 100000 was still 
missing 
with the turbulence of the traffic the money was flying in the 
air like a toyota commercial said police shift supervisor hank 
dimatteo he said at least 20 motorists stopped to grab cash 
causing a halfmile traffic jam 
rudy vega grabbed a canvas sack of money threw it in his car and 
drove home where he stacked the cash on the table and counted it 
he turned in the money to the fbi five hours later 
it was 440000 and i said this was too much money vega 
said my conscience would have really bothered me 
others werent quite so honest police charged two men with theft 
for allegedly grabbing 3840 in addition police got license plate 
numbers of about 20 other suspected cashgrabbers and planned to 
pursue them 
this is an education in greed in people campos said 
police said the driver of the truck apparently didnt secure the 
back doors before setting out from the federal reserve bank in el 
paso to the one in dallas

the government reported today that american 
businesses plan to increase spending on plants and equipment by a 
solid 65 percent in 1989 despite growing evidence that economic 
growth is slowing 
businesses responding to the commerce department survey said they 
expected to spend 45143 billion for expansion and modernization 
this year that is up from a record 42369 billion spent on 
business investment in 1988 the department said all of the numbers 
are adjusted for inflation 
the survey completed in may indicated that businesses have 
stepped up slightly their capital spending plans since a similar 
survey completed in march found plans to increase spending by 63 
percent this year 
in an even earlier survey of 1989 business investment plans 
conducted last december companies had estimated their capital 
spending would increase 59 percent this year 
the economy grew at a 43 percent annual rate during the first 
quarter of 1989 but growth in the gross national product was a 
sluggish 18 percent discounting a statistical bounceback from last 
summers drought that compares with gnp growth of 39 percent for 
all of 1988 
the slower growth is attributed to the federal reserves upward 
pressure on interest rates for 15 months as it attempted to slow the 
economy to ease inflation 
the projected growth in business spending would spell good news 
for the economy providing part of the momentum needed to guide it 
to a slower growth path without sliding into a recession 
it also could help stem inflation by boosting production and 
thus avoiding shortages and increasing the amount of goods available 
to american consumers 
capital spending grew 101 percent in 1988 as companies rushed to 
expand production to meet rising export demand it was the sharpest 
increase since a 166 percent jump in 1984 when businesses were 
still recovering from the 198182 recession 
spending climbed just 23 percent in 1987 and dropped 39 percent 
in 1986 
in the latest survey manufacturing companies said they planned a 
36 percent increase in capital outlays to 17054 billion compared 
to 128 percent in 1988 this includes a 14 percent rise in plants 
that produce durable goods items expected to last three years or 
more and a 57 percent increase in companies producing nondurable 
goods 
companies engaged in mining transportation and other 
nonmanufacturing ventures are expected to increase spending by 84 
percent to 28089 billion 
before adjusting for inflation 1989 plant and equipment spending 
is expected to rise by 99 percent to 47208 billion down from 
103 percent in 1988

parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani said 
today that iran will help free american hostages in lebanon if the 
united states tries to win freedom for iranians held by christian 
forces in lebanon 
it was the first time a top iranian leader has commented on the 
foreign hostages since the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on 
saturday under khomeini iran supported proiranian groups in 
lebanan which are believed to be holding most of the 15 foreign 
hostages including nine americans 
responding to a recent appeal by president bush to help gain the 
release of us hostages rafsanjani said that if the americans 
who have more influence than us on the phalangists rightwing 
christians in lebanon take action in securing the release of our 
hostages then they can expect our help 
rafsanjani was referring to four iranians who have been missing 
in lebanon for nearly seven years although the four are widely 
believed to be dead iran has repeatedly tried to use them as a 
bargaining chip with the united states 
in his other remarks during an unusual news conference with 
foreign reporters rafsanjani said it could take a long time to 
formally end the iraniraq war and that khomeini told him to improve 
relations with the soviet union he also said britain must take the 
initiative to improve ties with iran according to british news 
reports today iran will not withdraw khomeinis february order that 
moslems seek out and kill the salman rushdie author of the 
satanic verses but is prepared to let the matter drop many 
moslems believe the book defames islam 
the four iranians rafsanjani referred to were seized by 
rightwing christians in beirut in 1982 during the israeli invasion 
they include ahmad motevaselian commander of the contingent of 
iranian revolutionary guards based in the bekaa valley in east 
lebanon embassy charge daffaires hussein musavi and kazem akhavan 
a correspondent for irans official islamic republic news agency 
the fourth was their lebanese shiite moslem driver rastegar 
moqadam who also held an iranian passport

including nine americans terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press is the longest held of the 
foreign hostages in lebanon he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
on the 8year iraniraq war rafsanjani who is acting military 
commander said iran was not willing to make any concessions to iraq 
in the peace talks the unsponsored talks stalled soon after they 
started aug 25 
the official islamic republic news agency quoted him as saying 
we are determined to put an end to the war he said the 
stalement in peace talks may last for some time 
at his news conference rafsanjani quoted khomeini as saying days 
before he died that iran should improve ties with the soviet union 
rafsanjani said he would visit the soviet union later this month but 
that a date had not been set 
rafsanjani said khomeini told him to try to promote your 
relations with your big northern neighbor and we will follow this 
policy drawn by the imam 
iranians refer to khomeini as their imam or spiritual leader he 
died of a heart attack saturday 11 days after undergoing surgery 
for internal bleeding in his intestines rafsanjani was addressing 
foreign correspondents who gathered in tehran for khomeinis funeral 
tuesday 
in his will read to parliament after his death khomeini singled 
out the united states for special criticism but it also warned iran 
against aligning itself with the communist bloc 
on irans relations with the neighboring arab states in the 
persian gulf rafsanjani said there is no problem on our side 
for improving ties 
we have received positive signals from the persian gulf states 
except saudi arabia the speaker said 
saudi arabia severed ties with iran in april 1988 complaining 
that it supports terrorism and attempts to destabilize governments 
in the region the arab states backed iraq against iran in the gulf 
war 
strains developed again with saudi arabia after the kingdom 
announced it was maintaining quotas introduced last year on the 
number of pilgrims allowed to attend the annual hajj the pilgrimage 
to the moslem holy cities of mecca and medina more than 400 people 
most of them iranians died in clashes between saudi police and 
demonstraters during the hajj in 1987

a top nato commander cast doubt today on 
whether the east and west can agree to cut conventional forces and 
weapons within a year as proposed by president bush 
its optimistic indeed unrealistic i dont know west 
german gen wolfgang altenburg told reporters outside a nato defense 
ministers meeting at nato headquarters in brussels he heads natos 
panel of allied commanders 
he spoke as us defense secretary dick cheney and his nato 
colleagues opened their annual twoday spring session on military 
strategy 
the meeting follows a session at nato headquarters wednesday of 
12 european defense ministers that ended with a statement welcoming 
economic and political reforms in eastern europe but the ministers 
also said the soviet bloc remains more powerful in some military 
areas and does not appear to have slowed modernization of its forces 
in their sessions the ministers are studying proposals to 
increase the share of nato funds paid by several nations other than 
the united states 
in his remarks altenburg said eastwest relations were such that 
there is a lot of pressure from both sides to come to an early 
agreement 
at a nato summit last week in brussels bush proposed us and 
soviet troops in europe be cut to 275000 on each side and the 
number of combat planes and helicopters in east and west europe be 
reduced to 15 percent below natos current forces 
the proposal would mean a european cut in manpower of 30000 for 
the united states according to western estimates the soviet union 
would have to slash its troops in europe by 325000 to reach the 
same level 
bushs proposals endorsed by all nato allies will be added to 
proposals at conventional arms talks in vienna austria 
those discussions also cover proposed deep cuts in other nato and 
warsaw pact armaments including tanks and artillery 
bush seeking to quicken the pace of the talks that opened early 
this year said he hoped an accord on conventional force cuts could 
be reached within six months to a year with the reductions completed 
by 1992 or 1993 at his press conference altenburg called that a 
very severe time factor

weapons in the uzbek republics fergana valley where ethnic 
violence has killed 71 people official media said today 
more than 600 people have been injured and more than 400 arrested 
since the unrest began about two weeks ago in the eastern part of 
the central asian republic official radio moscow said 
thousands of interior ministry soldiers have curbed but not 
stopped arson and murder in the area 1500 miles southeast of 
moscow 
the official tass news agency reported that in the regions city 
of kokand a crowd of thousands stimulated by alcohol and drugs 
stormed a police station wednesday and tried to take weapons while 
another crowd of 600 attacked the transportation department of the 
interior ministry 
the attempts to obtain weapons failed but so did appeals from 
kokand government and party leaders for calm tass said six people 
died and more than 90 were injured 65 houses and more than 20 cars 
were set ablaze it said 
more houses are burning tass reported today 
in the city of fergana which has a population of more than 
200000 shootings and arson attempts continued wednesday night 
radio moscow reported 
a dispute between uzbeks and an ethnic turk minority led to 
pogroms arson beatings and murder accompanied by harassment and 
rape in conjunction with insolent marauding resistance to police 
and internal security forces uzbekistans premier told the 
government newspaper izvestia 
the premier gayrat kadyrov said 141 police officers along with 
100 civilians were hospitalized he said he expected the death toll 
of 71 to rise as the wounded died and more corpses were found in the 
ashes of gutted houses 
passions are still boiling izvestia said 
about 9000 internal security troops have been brought in to 
quell the unrest but tass said the government refrained from 
bringing in the red army 
tass said law enforcement officers and soldiers in the area have 
been authorized to use weapons for selfdefense 
an uzbek grassroots movement berlik appealed today to the 
soviet parliament to remedy the miserable living conditions that it 
said helped give rise to the unrest 
people in the villages are living on the edge of poverty and 
subsisting on bread and water because of the monopoly on cotton 
said the appeal read over the telephone from tashkent by the 
movements secretary gavkhar normatova 
activists claim that cotton production quotas imposed on 
uzbekistan by moscow have resulted in neglect of food production and 
ensuing shortages and has poisoned the enviromment with intensive 
use of fertilizers and pesticides 
there are 15 million unemployed in uzbekistan normatova 
said the real reason for this unthinkable slaughter is the 
economic political and cultural frustration of the people

involved in the unrest have been evacuated to a military training 
camp i dont want to oversimplify the situation he said but

premier li peng reappeared in public today and 
praised the the soldiers who crushed the student protests for 
democracy in tiananmen square you have worked hard comrades 
he declared 
at the same time the government issued new martial law orders 
demanding that student leaders surrender 
li gave a rousing speech to hundreds of soldiers inside the great 
hall of the people on the square where thousands demonstrated and 
where the massacre of hundreds of students took place over the 
weekend it was his first appearance in public since may 25 
lis speech was shown on television after hundreds of military 
trucks roared into the city center with new supplies busloads of 
foreigners fearing new violence rushed to the airport to catch 
emergency flights out 
li accompanied by vice president wang zhen also regarded as a 
hardline conservative was dressed in a mao suit and looked fit 
the martial law orders appeared to suggest the government was 
planning largescale arrests of activists who led the movement for a 
freer and less corrupt china 
the capitals streets were relatively calm today 
li is believed to be among the leaders who pushed for the 
military crackdown that ended in the weekend massacre of hundreds of 
unarmed civilians as troops cleared tiananmen square of 
prodemocracy protesters 
he had not appeared in public since five days after his may 20 
declaration of martial law in the capital and his appearance 
indicated hardliners may have prevailed over leaders who opposed 
using troops to quell the protests 
the student protesters had demanded li resign for declaring 
martial law after weeks of prodemocracy protests primarily in 
beijing 
the martial law orders called the leaders of independent student 
and union groups important members of the counterrevolutionary 
turmoil it demanded that all members of the groups leaders of 
the prodemocracy movement smashed by the military turn themselves 
in to police 
radio and television gave telephone numbers for people to call to 
report those who stood up against the military takeover of the city 
in a continuing propaganda campaign supporting the harsh military 
actions national television repeatedly showed footage of crowds 
attacking soldiers and burning vehicles during the crackdown in 
beijing on saturday night and sunday 
it showed gruesome shots of three soldiers who were burned to 
death one was disembowelled 
in his speech to the soldiers li urged them to continue 
working hard to protect the capitals safety and order they 
cheered and applauded 
a hong kong newspaper had reported that he had been shot and 
wounded in the thigh by a police officer on sunday after the 
military took tiananmen square 
hundreds of troop trucks rumbled into the city of beijing early 
today but residents claimed the hated 27th army which carried out 
the weekend assault had left the city replaced by new troops 
citizens attempted to establish order in their shattered lives 
under the watchful eyes of martial law troops and the government 
issued a new decree making it illegal to put up barricades in the 
street and disrupt traffic 
last week the people had pushed buses trucks and other objects 
into the streets in futile efforts to stop troops from entering the 
city 
the main concern has been that military units opposing the 
violent suppression of the prodemocracy movement would launch an 
attack to drive the 27th army from beijing roughly 200000 troops 
from about 13 army groups are bunched in and around the city 
in buses and caravans many bearing their countrys flags 
foreigners left for the airport where chartered flights took them 
out of the country they included nonessential personnel at the 
us embassy and their families 
weve taken an awful lot of moves to improve our security and 
the biggest one was putting those people on that plane and pulling 
them out of town us ambassador james lilley told reporters at 
the airport 
one asian diplomat said chinese officials in the past few days 
had been privately urging foreigners to leave the city because of 
the impending danger 
however troops were seen with brooms today rather than automatic 
rifles sweeping the streets south of tiananmen 
elsewhere disturbances still wracked many provincial cities 
a chinese source in sichuans capital chengdu where 
antigovernment violence has been reported said troops had come 
into the city but left 
in shanghai much of the work force stayed away from jobs because 
of street barricades set up in anticipation of a military assault 
other cities where protesters had barricaded rail lines and roads 
and besieged government offices included nanjing harbin tianjin 
and lanzhou 
there was a semblance of normalcy in beijing for the first time 
since the weekend onslaught bicyclists were able to pass unimpeded 
on the south side of tiananmen and catch a glimpse of the huge 
military encampment there 
armed soldiers lined the streets but there were no confirmed 
reports of troops opening fire on crowds which was common until 
today 
in one incident soldiers smashed the camera equipment of a 
british broadcasting corp crew and held a gun to the head of one 
crewman the crew filming near a burned out vehicle near the 
troops was released after 30 minutes of questioning at gunpoint 
chinas hardline leaders who appeared to gain the upper hand in 
a behindthescenes power struggle last week issued two harsh 
edicts wednesday 
one said troops were authorized to forcefully dispose of on 
the spot anyone who resists arrest the other said any communist 
party members who plotted organized and led the rebellion

israels proposal for palestinian elections 
in the occupied lands topped the agenda when delegations from the 
united states and the palestine liberation organization met today 
the two sides in their third session since the us government 
lifted its ban on contacts with the plo met in a tunisian 
government guest house in suburban carthage it was not known how 
long the session would last 
robert pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia and the 
only american official authorized to deal with the plo intended to 
discuss the israeliproposed elections in the occupied territories 
a us official said 
the plo delegation was led by yasser abdrabbou a member of the 
groups executive committee plo officials say they would accept the 
elections only if they were under international control and after an 
israeli withdrawal 
the us official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
plo needed to define what it meant by an israeli withdrawal 
plo chairman yasser arafat issued a statement today that said 
palestinians would accept un supervision of an election i ask 
the united states of america why did you agree on an international 
status for namibia and you refused such status in our occupied 
territories he said 
un troops moved into namibia in april to help supervise the 
african territorys transition to independence from south africa 
israel which considers the plo a terrorist organization has 
denounced the talks with the united states as an obstacle to peace 
israeli foreign minister moshe arens in an interview with the 
associated press in jerusalem on wednesday called the usplo 
dialogue counterproductive and said it undercut attempts to win 
the support of palestinians for israels peace proposals 
nearly all palestinians living in the occupied territories obey 
plo instructions whether or not they are members of the guerrilla 
organization 
the united states began its dialogue with the plo in december 
after arafat recognized israels right to exist and renounced 
terrorism 
as they prepared for the talks pelletreau and abdrabbou and 
their advisers sat across from each other at a table and chatted 
amiably in arabic while photographers and reporters milled around 
outside 
after a few minutes the reporters and photographers were asked to 
leave and the talks began in closed session 
at an unofficial meeting on may 18 the plos representative in 
tunis hakim balaoui handed pelletreau a memorandum concerning the 
proposals put forward by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
the plan calls for the 17 million palestinians in the 
israelioccupied territories to elect representatives to negotiate 
with israel for autonomy 
later talks would determine the final status of the west bank and 
gaza strip but israel has said an independent palestinian state is 
out of the question 
sources say the plo memorandum did not reject the shamir plan 
outright but outlined its conditions for elections in the occupied 
lands 
the united states for its part has told the plo it wants the 
palestinian uprising in the occupied territories stopped it also 
wants the plo to allow palestinians living in the lands to negotiate 
with the israelis a source said 
the united states also reportedly told the plo that its continued 
attempts to send guerrilla groups on raids into israel from lebanese 
and jordanian territory violated its promise to refrain from 
guerrilla activity 
arafat said recently in kuwait that nothing and nobody can 
deter the plo from attacking its main enemy israel 
in his monthly statement to palestinians in the occupied 
territories he told them not to let the enemy master the 
uprising and to reject the elections intended to create a 
leadership in replacement of the plo

two mathematicians have calculated pi to 480 
million decimal places more than doubling the mark set last year 
according to columbia university 
pi is an infinite string of numbers that is the ratio of the 
circumference of a circle to its diameter it is roughly equal to 22 
divided by seven 
gregory and david chudnovsky brothers who are associate research 
scientists at columbia made their calculation using supercomputers 
the university said in a statement 
their approach will allow mathematicians to grow the number from 
its middle or end without having to start at the beginning the 
university said 
the number they produced if printed out would be 600 miles 
long the university said 
it surpasses a calculation of about 201 million decimal places

terms of up to 15 years today for their part in a 71 million wells 
fargo robbery after the judge rejected claims they were prosecuted 
for their political views 
antonio camacho negron 45 an auto mechanic was sentenced to 15 
years and fined 150000 norman ramirez talavera a 32yearold 
graphic artist was sentenced to five years and fined 50000 both 
were convicted of conspiracy and other charges in the 1983 robbery 
the secondlargest cash heist in us history 
prosecutors said members of a militant puerto rican separatist 
group los macheteros engineered the robbery of a halfton of money 
from a wells fargo depot in west hartford to finance their 
activities 
camacho denounced his trial and that of four other defendants as 
a web of lies speaking in spanish through an intepreter he 
claimed he was being punished because he refused to abandon the 
cause of puerto rican independence 
i struggled for the liberty of puerto rico he said 
there is no right to rob money said us district judge t 
emmet clarie it is a crime throughout the world no one has been 
charged because of his political views 
neither defendant was accused of actually taking part in the 
holdup camacho was convicted of transporting stolen money ramirez

a federal judge said today he has broad 
discretion to consolidate two separate indictments against 
irancontra figure richard secord 
at a hearing chief us district judge aubrey robinson said he 
will rule friday whether to combine criminal charges that accuse 
secord of lying to congress to cover up personal profits in the 
irancontra affair with 1988 allegations that secord slipped illegal 
gifts to oliver l north 
thomas green secords attorney argued against bringing the two 
sets of charges together he said one of nine counts brought in 
april obstruction of congress is incredibly broad and will 
result in a lengthy battle over the use of classified material 
prosecutors have said they plan to introduce no classified material 
if secord is tried on the consolidated charges 
green urged robinson to try secord separately on the gratuities 
charges relating to north a step green said would enable a trial in 
the next month or so 
you wouldnt want that the judge said 
i would love that green insisted 
green said charges involving secords alleged lies to congress 
dont relate to the gratuities counts 
the judge said however that broad discretion is given to 
trial courts under federal rules that allow consolidation of 
separate indictments and that there doesnt need to be mechanical 
linkage 
at a previous hearing nov 19 was mentioned by lawyers as a 
possible starting date for a trial on consolidated indictments 
the government is pressing to join the two sets of charges and 
plans to abandon wideranging conspiracy and theft counts accusing 
secord of being involved in the diversion of iran armssales profits 
to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
because of the limited scope of the remaining charges any 
effort by secord to present classified material in his defense 
will be a claim with very little likelihood of success the 
government said in court papers filed wednesday 
identical conspiracy and theft charges against north were dropped 
because of national security concerns the government refuses to 
declassify sensitive material that would have to be presented in 
court in a trial of those charges 
secord who became an arms dealer after retiring as an air force 
major general is charged in a march 16 1988 indictment with 
offering and paying illegal gratuities to north 
in a separate indictment handed up in april secord is accused of 
lying to congress about his alleged profits in the irancontra 
affair which the government says were in excess of 1 million 
north then a white house aide enlisted secord to run arms to 
the contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the 
rebels secord also was accused in the april indictment of lying 
when he denied that any money from a complex of overseas companies 
known as the enterprise benefited north 
with the requested consolidation the government will offer 
no classified documents as exhibits in the prosecutions case the 
government said in court papers 
it said willard zucker who moved money in the irancontra affair 
for secord and his business partner albert hakim will be the 
principal witness regarding the charges of lying to congress 
zucker a former internal revenue service lawyer now living in 
switzerland will be a key witness for the government on the 
gratuities charges the independent counsels office said 
the gratuities charges involve a 13800 home security system for 
north and a 200000 fund set aside for the education of his 
children 
north was convicted last month of accepting the security system 
from secord along with falsifying and destroying documents and 
aiding and abetting in the obstruction of congress he will be 
sentenced june 23

a gesture of good will to high school 
seniors backfired when charlottedouglas international airport 
officials tried to reroute planes so noise wouldnt interfere with 
outdoor graduation ceremonies 
wednesdays less than satisfactory results were felt all the way 
to atlanta 
we had absolutely the worst of all possible situations said 
airport director jerry orr 
it was a mess said phil loftin federal aviation 
administration tower chief 
the airport changed its takeoff and landing patterns to reduce 
noise during 930 am commencements at olympic west mecklenburg 
and harding high schools located near the ends of the airports 
three runways 
but flights already delayed by thunderstorms got even later when 
the charlotte airport started its rerouting and delays quickly 
spread to some connecting airports as planes were late leaving or 
had to await a chance to land 
i know some planes sat on the ground in atlanta for an 
excessive period loftin said 
that meant some passengers waiting in charlotte missed 
connections 
we heard a lot of complaints from a lot of people today orr 
said 
even the commencement ceremonies suffered because the 
thunderstorms worsened and controllers had to abandon the plan and 
send planes out as fast as they could 
with thick clouds reflecting the sound noise from the jets 
boomed down onto west mecklenburg high north of the airport and 
olympic to the south orr said one jet flew directly over olympic 
four over west mecklenburg 
not by the count of kay boone a secretary at west mecklenburg 
i sat out there and counted 13 planes in 45 minutes she said

about two dozen deputies from the baltics walked 
out of the soviet congress today to protest what they called 
infringement on their republics sovereignty 
comrades comrades i ask you to be calm because this is not 
all so simple president mikhail s gorbachev urged the deputies 
as they left the kremlins palace of congresses 
earlier a radical economist told the parliament the country 
should cut aid to the kremlins latin america allies and pay farmers 
in hard currency to help avert imminent economic collapse 
another deputy said the country was on the brink of ecological 
disaster 
the deputies walked out after they objected to formation of a 
committee by the 2250member congress of peoples deputies that 
will decide whether laws conform to the soviet constitution they 
said the committee could encroach on their republics the 
legislatures of estonia and lithuania have proclaimed the right to 
veto laws approved by the central government in moscow 
our electors ordered us to take care of the sovereignty of our 
republics said romas v gudaitis a writer from lithuania we 
consider the elections of the constitutional inspection committee to 
be without purpose and we will not take part in them 
lithuanian deputies among the most vocal at the session that 
began on may 25 led the walkout the tass news agency reported it 
was not immediately clear if other representatives joined them 
soviet tv cameras in a live broadcast of the sesssion showed 
about 25 deputies storming out 
baltic deputies complained that they had not had enough time to 
study the committees functions and said the matter should be 
postponed until the parliaments fall session 
the question is so serious lets not hurry said igor gryazin 
of tartu in estonia 
the congress voted overwhelmingly to form the committee but 433 
deputies opposed this 
gorbachev said he would consult with the deputies who objected 
and that the issue would be taken up again on friday 
the walkout was the first since the congress convened and was the 
most dramatic sign of opposition to the communist party 
establishment that runs the session and nominates committee members 
and other officials 
earlier today economist nikolai shmelev warned that if 
snowballing inflation worsening consumer shortages and the 
monstrous budget deficit are not halted in two or three years 
we could face an economic crash 
shmelev one of the soviet unions most prominent reformminded 
economists said premier nikolai i ryzhkovs economic program 
underestimates the gravity of the countrys crisis 
ryzhkov on wednesday announced plans for defense cuts and 
government relief for the nearly 40 million soviet citizens he said 
were living below the poverty line 
shmelev said the government must do away with gorbachevs 
antialcohol campaign and import more than 15 billion of goods to 
ease the countrys consumer crisis 
gorbachevs cutbacks on alcohol sales introduced two months 
after he came to power in march 1985 led to massive losses of 
government revenue and widespread homedistilling 
shmelev said the hard currency to pay for imports could come 
partly from motivating soviet farmers to work harder by offering 
rewards in foreign currency 
deputies applauded when he suggested the government tell 
collective farm chairmen if they sell grain and meat to the state 
above a certain level they will be paid in hard currency with the 
right of spending it wherever they want 
the extra crops they produce would be cheaper than the current 
soviet practice of buying grain abroad to make up for shortfalls in 
domestic harvests he said 
shmelev also called for a cut in aid to latin america 
quoting us estimates that the soviet union spends 6 billion to 
8 billion on activities there especially in aid to cuba he said 
no one understands what a significant portion of that money is 
spent on 
his speech was in line with the vocal combative role assumed by 
some members of the new congress in the past soviet lawmakers 
docilely adopted any measure submitted by kremlin leaders 
deputy alexi yablokov a moscow biologist said the government 
should stop issuing economic decrees 
our national economy reminds me of a frog he said every 
one of its jumps is a decree sometimes it jumps straight ahead 
sometimes to the right sometimes to the left depending on what 
scares it at the moment 
yakblovkov also said every third soviet man will suffer from 
cancer caused by pollution he blamed the countrys massive 
ecological problems on loss of local control 
ryzhkov in his economic program presented to congress on 
wednesday said the kremlin would continue trimming defense spending 
through 1995 and reduce the amount of national income spent on 
defense by up to 50 percent

president bush who is making his debut in 
primetime television tonight with an east room news conference 
talked with industry leaders today about the environment and 
promised new cleanair legislation to significantly improve the 
quality of life in america 
bush conferred with industry officials during the morning and 
arranged an afternoon session with environmentalists to talk about 
proposed changes in the 1970 clean air act 
at 8 pm edt he planned to meet with reporters to answer 
questions 
in a speech for ducks unlimited a conservation group bush said 
that on monday he will unveil the most sweeping changes to the 
clean air act since it was last amended 12 years ago 
it will allow us to recover and restore precious forests lakes 
and streams he said and whether americans live near factories 
in cities or in high woodland country it will significantly improve 
every north americans quality of life 
bush told the industry leaders he was still working on his 
proposal he promised in february to fix a date certain for reducing 
smokestack emissions that cause acid rain which is blamed for 
killing waterways and forests particularly in northeastern america 
and canada 
bushs news conference tonight coincides with the start of the 
evacuation from china of all dependents of us government employees 
and nonessential personnel 
we have urged all other americans in china to leave at once 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said wednesday he said 
us embassy personnel were trying to arrange safe transportation to 
the airport from beijing hotels and other locations 
tonights news conference marks bushs first questionandanswer 
session in the stately chandeliered east room of the white house 
he has met with reporters on numerous occasions in the first 4 
months of his presidency but always during the day and never in the 
formal setting of the east room 
by scheduling the session in televisions primetime hours bush 
assures himself of the largest possible audience 
fitzwater said bush has held 16 to 23 news conferences so far 
depending on how you define a news conference on monday for 
example bush fielded questions for 20 minutes in the white house 
briefing room 
bush also has held question and answer sessions in ottawa tokyo 
brussels bonn and london they have ranged in length from a few 
minutes to about a half hour 
fitzwater said the white house has been looking for an 
opportunity for the past two months to have a fullblown east room 
news conference he said bush decided to go ahead now given the 
developments in china and his success at the nato summit in 
brussels where he defused a crisis over shortrange nuclear 
missiles and proposed a cutback in soviet and american combat troops 
traditionally presidential news conferences run for a half hour 
but bush may ignore that fitzwater said he described his boss as 
a president who has trouble confining himself to 30 minutes 
fitzwater said bush would open with a prepared statement but 
likely would not make any announcements as he did monday in ending 
military sales to china 
fitzwater said bush was not making any special preparations for 
the news conference although his wednesday afternoon schedule was 
largely clear of appointments the spokesman said bush would meet 
sometime today with his staff to discuss areas of questions 
in another development fitzwater said bush will visit 
yellowstone national park and the grand tetons in wyoming on monday 
after proposing legislation to overhaul the clean air act 
the press spokesman said bush would stop in lincoln neb on the 
way home tuesday to deliver a speech on alternative fuels also part 
of the environmental package to be unveiled monday 
while at yellowstone the president will visit some of the areas 
charred from the fires last summer that are now undergoing 
revegetation fitzwater said 
he will spend the night in a lodge near jackson hole wyo and 
speak tuesday morning at the teton science school 
his clean air proposal still in the final stages of preparation 
is expected to call for tighter standards for emissions that cause 
acid rain and for more strictly controlling auto exhaust emissions

an international commission urged the united 
states and canada on thursday to bar new species of animals from the 
great lakes in an effort to prevent additional harm to the regions 
delicate ecology 
the integrity of the great lakes ecosystem requires the 
maintenance of a balanced yet dynamic natural system the 
international joint commission a uscanadian agency said in a 
report on the lakes environment 
introduced species can seriously affect the balance and 
distribution of native species by altering the structure and 
developmental patterns of their biological communities it added 
the report by the commission noted that there have been 
continuing concerns about outside species in the lakes the sea 
lamprey and smelt in particular 
however in recent years the number of alien species introduced 
into the lakes has shown a significant increase 
among the outside species that now threaten the lakes native 
life forms are the alewife the coho salmon the asiatic clam the 
zebra mussel and the river ruffe 
the commission encouraged involvement by the coast guards of the 
united states and canada in controlling the problem and recommended 
that the nations take steps to prevent the further introduction 
particularly the unplanned introduction of exotic life forms into 
the great lakes ecosystem 
it was the first time the commission had made such a 
recommendation said frank bevacqua of the commissions washington 
office 
some of the outside species were introduced for sport fishing 
others made their way into the lakes as hitchhikers on ships or 
through extending their range from bodies of water outside the lakes 
region 
although the new species are controlled by predators in their 
original homes many lack predators in the lakes and given an 
adequate food supply and appropriate lifesupport systems they 
can become a serious threat if they outcompete or destroy valuable 
native species the commission said 
the report also warned of increasing concentrations of toxic 
substances in great lakes animals a reversal of declines recorded 
in the 1970s 
waterbirds on the lakes however were producing more offspring 
the commission said 
populations that were once declining have increased 
substantially and reproductive problems in fisheating birds are 
generally confined to specific sites the report said 
similarly increasing bald eagle nesting sites are being reported 
in the basin 
the report gave no figures on increased toxicsubstance 
concentration or bird reproduction

the state supreme court ruled today that 
kentuckys school system is unconstitutional because of the spending 
gap between rich and poor districts and it ordered the legislature 
to develop a new setup 
the ruling has no immediate effect on the 600000 students the 
court ruling 51 with a seventh justice partly concurring and 
partly dissenting gave the legislature until the end of its 1990 
session to come up with a system to even out spending 
we do not direct the general assembly to raise taxes it is 
their decision how best to achieve efficiency the court said 
however the court said the legislature in what would be a 
major departure must make local tax rates uniform 
the ruling was prompted by a lawsuit filed in 1985 by 66 
propertypoor districts they charged that the schoolfinance 
system which depends on property taxes is not fair in a state 
where wealth varies widely from the appalachian coalfields in 
eastern kentucky to the affluent cincinnati suburbs 
most states have similar setups in which state spending on 
education is supplemented by revenue raised locally through property 
taxes 
in 1988 a judge agreed with the plaintiffs that the legislature 
had failed to meet its obligation under the kentucky constitution to 
establish an equitable system of public or common schools in 
either spending or quality 
the supreme court largely upheld the judges finding saying that 
kentucky children including those who by accident of birth and 
residence live in poor areas are entitled to the same educational 
opportunities 
this obligation cannot be shifted to local counties and local 
school districts the court said 
chief justice robert stephens writing for the court said 
lest there be any doubt the result of our decision is that 
kentuckys entire system of common schools is unconstitutional 
including its financing regulations 
the court said the legislature has a chance to launch an era of 
educational opportunity which will ensure a strong economic 
cultural and political future 
gov wallace wilkinson lauded the ruling we have the 
opportunity to rebuild to redefine education in kentucky and if we 
fail we will have failed ourselves our fellow kentuckians and 
particularly our children he said 
schools superintendent john brock said today was the happiest 
day of my professional life 
today the court has propelled us from the 19th century to the 
21st he said 
justice charles leibson in a dissent said the ruling was 
confusing overreaching and destined to spawn worrisome lawsuits

hammers pounded at building sites table tennis 
resumed on campuses and soldiers cleaned up the debris beijing was 
calm thursday almost normal but students in the prodemocracy 
movement say it wont last 
the calm is just superficial said a senior at beijing normal 
university whose students helped lead the seven weeks of 
demonstrations with so many people killed there cannot be real 
calm its just a matter of time before the movement peaks again 
the government said nearly 300 people were killed but chinese 
and foreign diplomats estimate as many as 3000 died when soldiers 
with tanks and automatic weapons rolled into the city on saturday 
and retook tiananmen square from the students occupying it 
soldiers still fired into the air and at some bystanders 
thursday but far less often than before 
dozens of small restaurants and shops reopened because of the 
relative quiet along with a few post offices banks remained closed 
the beijing daily and beijing evening news were on sale for the 
first time since saturday and people formed long lines to buy them 
both were filled with articles denying heavy casualties among 
civilians and reporting the reopening of businesses 
theres no news one reader said in disgust 
most residents still stayed away from their jobs thousands took 
bicycle tours of the city stopping to gape at bullet holes in 
buildings and bloodstains on walls 
curiosityseekers clambered over the hulks of tanks burned by 
citizens they crowded around hospital morgues watching families 
carry out bodies 
people walked boldly up to soldiers ringing tiananmen square 
which has been sealed since sunday the troopers politely but firmly 
refused to answer questions 
residents of the area insisted they were not the same soldiers 
who stormed the square saturday night 
the evening television news thursday showed soldiers crouching 
using pieces of metal and their hands to clear away ashes and debris 
others hauled the wrecks of buses and tanks off beijings main 
streets put twisted road dividers back in place and swept the 
curbs a dozen troopers walked west along changan avenue the main 
street trimming tree branches away from telephone lines 
whatever the soldiers did dozens of curious residents watched 
and commented 
if we sit around inside we get too nervous so we go out to 
have a look said a restaurant cook who spent the day cycling 
around the city exchanging stories with other residents 
minzu hotel employees said all their guests had left but several 
said they reported for work to protect the property there have 
been no reports of looting 
life is normal when we go home we cook eat said a woman 
clerk who sat on a pile of wool rugs in a souvenir shop reading a 
weekold newspaper 
i spend the day listening to the radio and worrying said a 
middleaged professor strolling near his home 
few students still live on beijing campuses and said they rarely 
venture out of their dormitories at beijing normal some played 
table tennis while others snacked read or napped 
the education commission ordered thursday that schools take steps 
to resume classes but the word at beijing normal was that too few 
students and teachers remained 
we dont know what to do one student said we are waiting 
for orders but our leaders are all gone 
rumors have circulated that some student leaders were killed but 
an activist in hiding told the associated press all were alive 
maybe new leaders will have to emerge another said the 
movement hasnt ended things may be calm for awhile but the army 
cant stay forever when it goes we students will protest again 
he and others said they still seek the resignations of senior 
leader deng xiaoping and other hard liners who ordered the crackdown 
i have no regrets one said no one thought things would 
come to this but it would not have if the local citizens hadnt 
supported us we students have great responsibility and maybe we 
should apologize to the citizens but they are responsible too

most of the americans who will greet the 21st 
century are already alive a group far different from their 
ancestors who welcomed the arrival of the 1900s population analysts 
said thursday 
during the 20th century the nations population has grown to 
unprecedented numbers people moved south and west and there have 
been major shifts in family life and in the status of women 
the 21st century is still about a dozen years away but from a 
population perspective the future is now 
over 80 percent of the people who will make up the population 
of the united states in the year 2000 are now alive said a new 
study by the private population reference bureau 
the elderly of the 21st century are already well into their 
lifespans and the first high school class of the next century is now 
in the elementary grades the independent bureau added in a study 
released thursday america in the 21st century a demographic 
overview 
at the same time the census bureau issued its population 
profile of the united states 1989 looking at the countrys 
current population status 
the aging of america is likely the most discussed and documented 
trend with 298 million elderly in the country as of 1987 122 
percent of the population and twothirds of the group being women 
the census bureau reported 
the agency said that this group will continue growing into the 
next century jumping to one american in five when the massive 
postworld war ii baby boom generation hits seniorcitizen status by 
about the year 2030 
that will critically impact health care and retirement income 
programs said the population reference bureau study 
there will be a relative scarcity of young people to take 
entrylevel jobs school enrollment could shrink and employers will 
face a different mix of potential workers 
retraining of older workers may become an economic necessity 
said the private group and there may become a need to ease 
immigration rules to recruit certain skilled people from other 
countries 
the traditional family of working husband while the wife 
stays home with the children has disappeared from the scene 
under half of all families have children and even in families 
that have offspring the majority of mothers held jobs outside the 
home as of 1987 the census bureau reported 
at the same time the population reference bureau said that the 
growing incidence of divorce and outofwedlock births has fueled an 
enormous increase in singleparent families 
currently nearly one in four children lives with only one parent 
compared with one in 10 in 1960 the private group said 
the growing concern over child care elder care and parental 
leave will continue well into next century the group added 
rapidly growing black and hispanic populations have also 
attracted attention in recent years with the census bureau 
reporting that blacks now constitute 122 percent of americans while 
hispanics make up 8 percent meaning that although there is some 
overlap these two groups now include nearly one in five americans 
by 2000 nearly onethird of all schoolage children will be 
from minority populations the population reference bureau 
reported 
the decline in birth rates in recent years means that the growth 
in the labor force will slacken but an anticipated shortage of 
workers in the next century will be one of the types of employees 
available not the total number the private group said 
jobs of the future will demand a moderate to high level of 
education and training compared with jobs of the past the group 
added and business concerns will center on the potential mismatch 
between worker skills and job requirements

a soviet mig29 fighter crashed today while doing a 
high performance aerobatic routine at the paris air show the 
pilot the lone occupant ejected from the jet before it exploded 
the crash occurred in the middle of the airfield up to 700 feet 
away from the nearest spectators witnesses said the pilot was 
taken to a military hospital where he was reported to be in 
satisfactory condition 
no other casualties were reported 
the fighter performed flips and turns before making its final 
pass over le bourget airfield in preparation for landing when 
witnesses saw two pieces fall from the aircraft the jet then 
plunged to the ground and burst into flames 
the air show which opens to the public on friday was attended 
today by the exhibitors reporters and invited guests 
fire engines and a water tanker doused the flaming wreckage of 
the plane 
air show spokesman patrick guerin said of the pilot it seems 
he had a mechanical problem with the left engine as the plane was 
turning at 1000 feet when he realized what was happening 
showing excellent reflexes he ejected but he was too low he 
didnt have time to open his chute 
soviet and air show officials said the pilot was taken to a 
nearby hospital then to the military hospital at st mande east of 
paris 
the pilots condition was more or less satisfactory and he is 
able to talk said alexander batkov of the ministry of aviation 
industry 
batkov identified the pilot as anatoly kvochur 37 and described 
him as one of our best 
batkov said this was only the second mig29 in history to crash 
the cause was not known he said 
the specialists must analyze the situation batkov said 
when we see the film well know what happened it is too early to 
ask questions yet 
air show officials said there were no plans to suspend further 
demonstrations 
the most serious crash in the recent history of the biennial air 
show was in 1973 when a soviet supersonic tupolev 144 exploded in 
flight killing the sixman crew and seven people in the nearby 
village of goussainville where it hit the ground 
on aug 28 1988 70 people died after three italian air force 
stunt jets collided at a ramstein air base air show in west germany 
one plane plowed into spectators at the event 
those who witnessed todays crash said the mig apparently lost a 
wing or an engine 
the two mig 29s at the air show arrived on monday as part of a 
large contingent of soviet aircraft on display 
john wood of woburn mass a pilot and president of thermetics 
an air show exhibitor said the twinengine plane was making a 
very highperformance routine which included vertical climbs on 
engine power alone 
the pilot was putting it through a very punishing routine he 
said adding that the jet might have suffered structural failure 
even before the show opened soviet jet fighters were performing 
aerobatics in the skies above the airport north of paris that 
appeared to astound industry professionals 
the mig29 was the hit of the farnsworth air show held earlier 
this year in england 
according to janes all the worlds aircraft 198889 the 
singleseat combat jet has been used since 1985 and replaced 
mig21s and mig23s 
about 450 mig29s are in service and 44 have been delievered to 
india according to janes 
the dogfighter is powered by two turbofan engines and can carry 
six medium or closerange airtoair missiles it can also carry 
bombs and rockets 
on may 20 soviet air force pilot alexander zuyev stole a mig29 
from an airfield north of the soviet black sea coastal city of 
batumi and flew to turkey turkish officials refused a request by 
us military experts to examine the plane before it was returned to 
the soviet union

rep dan rostenkowski who traditionally has 
viewed the capitalgains tax preference as the ultimate plaything of 
the rich is signaling a change of heart may be on the way if the 
price is right 
the price might require president bush to back away from his 
campaign pledge not to raise taxes even in that unlikely event 
some members of the house ways and means committee which 
rostenkowski chairs said thursday they would be reluctant to accept 
any such bargain even as part of a deficitreduction measure 
for the moment however rostenkowski dill is indicating a 
willingness to at least discuss the question with bush a former 
committee colleague 
he doesnt like a lower tax rate for capital gains an aide 
to rostenkowski insisted thursday but could it ever be 
acceptable the answer is yes if the president offered in return 
something so attractive to democrats that they couldnt turn it 
down added the aide who spoke only on condition he not be 
identified by name 
the aide elaborated on rostenkowskis position after the 
chairman in separate interviews wednesday with the new york times 
and the wall street journal suggested some kind of capitalgains 
cut could be acceptable as part of a deficitreduction plan 
the aide said he is not sure rostenkowskis position has been 
changed all that much despite a long record of criticizing the 
capitalgains benefit im not about to tell the wage earners in 
chicago that they should pay a higher tax than stockbrokers he 
said in february when bush called for the change rostenkowski 
never says never the staff member explained 
the staff of the joint committee on taxation estimates that 80 
percent of the tax cut under bushs capitalgains proposal would go 
to those with incomes over 100000 a year those under 50000 
would get 86 percent 
thats traditional republican economics said rep byron 
dorgan dnd a ways and means member who said he is not sure the 
committee is anywhere near a consensus for a capitalgains cut 
if the chairman has changed his stance it apparently is because 
of the budget deficit 
the ways and means committee has been directed by congress to 
raise 53 billion in extra revenues for the budget year that begins 
next oct 1 if several expiring tax benefits are to be renewed the 
figure will go higher 
bush has proposed his own package of relatively minor revenue 
raisers including higher social security taxes on some state and 
local government workers and renewal of the expiring tax on 
telephone service 
the president also has called for taxing capital gains profits 
from the sale of stock and certain property at a lower rate than 
applies to wages unlike most tax cuts he insists such a reduction 
would raise revenue by encouraging more economic activity 
a great number of economists dont buy that argument over the 
long run including some who advise congress however congress 
experts and bushs experts agree that such a rate cut would raise 
more money in the first year simply by encouraging people to unload 
some investments they had been holding for a while 
rostenkowski has discussed the possibility of cutting the 
capitalgains rate for one year perhaps two that would be followed 
by restoring a higher rate but indexing capital gains so that in 
the future an investor would not be taxed on profits that were 
caused solely by inflation 
congressional economists say such a plan would cost the 
government revenues after the first year bush presumably would be 
expected to go along with some kind of other tax increase to make up 
that loss 
i dont know if i am prepared to make a tradeoff on capital 
gains said rep robert matsui dcalif saying it could cause a 
return to the abusive tax shelters that were all but wiped out by 
the 1986 tax overhaul and a multiyear reduction would mean we 
would be sacrificing future years revenues for one year of deficit 
reduction 
dorgan also said good tax policy must not be sacrificed we 
just went through tax reform where the tax system was so riddled 
with loopholes for the rich and we spent a lot of time correcting 
that national disgrace he said 
wiping out the special capitalgains benefit and the tax shelters 
it fed is often cited as one of the major plusses of the 1986 
overhaul rostenkowski has said on several occasions that restoring 
the capitalgains break would open the door to junking the new law

two researchers say they have cut themselves a 
record slice of pi 480 million decimal places of one of the most 
famous numbers in mathematics 
that exceeds the mark of about 201 million decimal places 
produced last year in japan david chudnovsky of columbia university 
said thursday 
pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter 
the infinite string of digits begins with 314159 and contains no 
obvious pattern 
the newly calculated number would stretch for 600 miles if 
printed columbia university said 
chudnovsky and his brother gregory associate research scientists 
at columbia came up with the number after devising a new algorithm 
which is a series of mathematical steps 
the algorithm lets researchers calculate more and more decimal 
places for pi by simply adding to an existing string rather than 
having to start from scratch chudnovsky said 
it also has a selfcorrecting feature that can check whether the 
pi calculation is on the right track while the calculation is in 
progress he said 
the researchers checked their calculation by running the 
algorithm through two supercomputers with different hardware and 
software chudnovsky said when the results were compared 
everything perfectly fitted together 
so what good is knowing this number 
we can use it as a very stringent test for testing the 
performance of hardware and software said chudnovsky who called 
pi calculations the ultimate stress test 
and by calculating pi out to great lengths researchers can 
investigate whether the string of digits is random or contains some 
hidden pattern he said 
we sort of see more of the tail of the dragon he said 
the new work is to be presented next week at a conference on 
computers and mathematics at the massachusetts institute of 
technology 
peter borwein associate professor of mathematics at dalhousie 
university in halifax nova scotia canada said the new work 
appears to be a record 
tackling the digits of pi has become something of a benchmark 
in computational sophistication he said in a telephone interview 
it seems like since there have been computers people have been 
using them to compute the digits of pi

secretary of state james a baker iii saying 
the time is ripe called on soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
today to respond to president bushs proposals to slash conventional 
military forces in europe 
baker in remarks to the national press club said the united 
states is looking for such a response when the soviet leader visits 
west germany next week 
at last weeks nato summit bush put forward an elaborate 
fourpart plan for reducing eastwest troop strength and nonnuclear 
forces in europe 
we urged the soviets to reduce unilaterally their shortrange 
nuclear systems to our levels next week general secretary 
gorbachev can sustain this new spirit by answering our call by 
announcing a real cut in soviet snf shortrange nuclear forces 
baker said 
the time is ripe for mr gorbachev to respond positively to the 
opportunities presented by natos initiatives indeed we look for 
him to do so when he travels to the federal republic of germany next 
week baker added 
the summit meeting of the north atlantic treaty organization had 
provided a major lift for bush who had been criticized for failing 
to respond effectively to gorbachevs muchpublicized arms control 
initiatives 
the session also eased a major controversy between the united 
states and west germany bush was able to smooth over the rift 
between the allies by agreeing to negotiations on the shortrange 
nuclear weapons which are primarily based in germany and if used 
would probably explode on german soil 
under the compromise the united states agreed to enter into the 
negotiations to achieve a partial reduction of the weapons once 
the implementation of the conventional arms agreement was under 
way 
in the view of us and british officials that also meant that 
the shortrange weapons would not be eliminated and would remain in 
the nato arsenal 
under bushs proposal the western alliance would agree to a 
ceiling of 275000 on the number of soviet and american troops on 
foreign soil 
that would amount to a reduction of some 30000 us troops and 
325000 soviet troops 
besides his proposals on troop cuts the president proposed that 
the scope of the talks be broadened to include aircraft a 
longstanding soviet suggestion 
in speech to the united nations last dec 7 gorbachev said that 
by the end of 1990 the soviets would withdraw six tank divisions 
from the warsaw pact nations of east germany hungary and 
czechoslovakia and reduce soviet troops in eastern europe by 50000 
the united states and britain have insisted that nato retain 
shortrange nuclear missiles in order to offset the warsaw pacts 
far larger conventional forces 
nato has 88 shortrange lance launchers and their 700 
nucleartipped missiles in west germany while the warsaw pact has 
1600 shortrange launchers

he shows them movies he feeds them popcorn he 
takes them on tours of the first familys living quarters he knows 
their first names 
george bushs relationship with reporters isnt a honeymoon its 
a courtship or maybe a seduction 
so far in his presidency bush has given reporters what they most 
want access but he hasnt given them enough of what they want 
almost as much news 
before his first bigproduction primetime press conference on 
thursday night bush already was meeting often usually once a week 
with reporters in brief daytime sessions 
but because his administration hadnt framed its own policies on 
most issues and because bush was cautious in commenting on foreign 
affairs what the president had to say did not tend to generate big 
headlines 
for a while you had an awful lot of griping yes hes a nice 
guy hes given us access but where are the stories commented 
stephen hess on thursday a senior fellow at the brookings 
institution hess studies the relationship between press and 
government and is the author of the washington reporters 
there was almost a slight longing for the bad old days under 
ronald reagan where he didnt see them much or respect them but he 
gave them lots of stories hess said 
that changed with bushs trip to europe last month for a summit 
with allied leaders and his dramatic proposals for cuts in the 
standing armies of east and west 
as he had promised he eventually would bush started making 
presidentialsize news 
a washington hand for three decades bush is comfortable with the 
press and a master of detail he tends to give more complete 
answers than reagan offered 
bush calls reporters who cover the white house by their first 
names has some in for offtherecord sessions sometimes invites a 
few upstairs for a notyetreleased movie and popcorn and soft 
drinks 
hardly a week passes that he doesnt field their questions on 
monday when he called a news conference on 15 minutes notice to 
announce sanctions against china reporter david hoffman of the 
washington post arrived late and asked a question that ended 
could you explain what the point of doing that is 
chided bush i already did david you missed it then he 
went on to make his point again 
that kind of relaxed relationship is the mark of an expert hess 
said 
the really good washington politicians affect an easygoing 
banter a light humor and the one who personified it best was 
franklin roosevelt he said such politicians he said know 
that reporters are very easy to flatter 
roosevelt mesmerized the press he met with reporters in those 
pretelevision days nearly 1000 times in his 13 years in office 
hess noted that bush is following almost all the recommendations 
of a report last october by the harvard commission on presidential 
news conferences composed of journalists and professors who spent a 
year studying how to revive a 75yearold institution 
the commission said that under reagan the press conference had 
fallen into a serious state of disrepair reagan formally met 
reporters infrequently he let 5 months during the irancontra 
affair slide by without a news conference 
the commissions principal proposal frequent routine and 
undramatic news conferences 
the panel said presidents should meet with the media twice a 
month and do it during daylight hours to reduce the temperature 
and encourage more substantive and useful exchanges it called for 
limiting primetime news conferences to six a year 
hess said the massive news conference generally doesnt 
generate much news 
it isnt a very good way to get information out he said 
its a way for the people to see a president in action so it 
serves him and it serves the egos of the press corps but there are 
better ways to make news

the respected magazine sunday mainichi broke with 
japanese journalism tradition this week by reporting prime minister 
sousuke uno kept a highly paid geisha as his mistress three years 
ago 
uno who took office just a week ago denied the report but its 
publication broke a longheld code of silence in the japanese news 
media about publishing or broadcasting reports on such liasons by 
government officials 
it is not unusual for japanese men especially if they are 
wealthy to keep mistresses while their wives are expected to 
remain faithful 
shuntaro torigoe the magazines editor in chief said he 
published the article because he wanted to bring issues of social 
ethics into the public arena 
we also want americans who are critical of politicians to 
know that in japan we are changing he added 
the story generated about 100 telephone calls to the magazines 
office in four days some 80 percent of the callers supported the 
mainichis decision to publish the story while the rest objected to 
the story as a violation of unos privacy 
sunday mainichi quoted the woman as saying uno had paid her 
300000 yen 2100 a month over a fourmonth period in 1985 the 
magazine said it did not identify her by name at her request it 
said she was 40 years old uno is 66 
he is not a man of noble character the article quoted the 
woman as saying i dont want him to use politics the same way he 
treated me 
geishas are women highly trained in music dance and making 
conversation while they are not prostitutes some develop intimate 
relationships with customers who become their patrons 
while most major newspapers and television networks avoided the 
unogeisha story some of japans sensationalist tabloids compared 
it to the sex scandal involving democratic presidential aspirant 
gary hart in the united states 
if it happened in the united states he would have to go the 
daily gendai said of uno 
uno was named prime minister june 2 after a long search for a 
scandalfree politician to replace the tainted administration of 
noboru takeshita who resigned to take responsibility for a massive 
recruit bribery scandal 
the geisha story is the only blemish so far in unos case 
he denied the liason with the geisha 
its out of the question uno told the tokyo shimbun 
although the magazine is a sunday publication it has been on 
newsstands since monday 
uno has not been asked about the article during question periods 
in the diet japans parliament 
kuniko inoguchi a professor of political science at sophia 
university said that in the past 15 years keeping mistresses has 
come to be considered against the social ethic 
if you are in a prestigious position in politics or business 
you have to be clean both with money and with sex ms inoguchi 
said its now part of the general code of conduct 
but she added that the recruit scandal in which a conglomerate 
allegedly sought to buy favors from politicians and bureaucrats with 
cutrate stocks and political donations may have worn the japanese 
down 
now that the recruit scandal has come to an end people might 
be a little tired of picking on politicians right now she said 
takako doi the chairman of the opposition japan socialist party 
and the most powerful woman in politics refused to comment on the 
report

a republican senator lashed out thursday at the 
pentagon system of providing a housing allowance to military 
personnel living outside installations charging that the current 
policy is unfair to residents of economicallydepressed areas 
ive never seen worse stupidity in my life sen ted stevens 
ralaska said at a senate appropriations defense subcommittee 
hearing on military manpower 
the object of stevens ire was the variable housing allowance a 
stipend that military personnel forced to live off base during a 
threetofour year stint can use to help defray the cost of housing 
the allowance is based on 80 percent of local housing costs and 
changes annually depending on the housing market 
for military personnel with mortgages or extended leases and 
living in the southwest and alaska two areas hardest hit by 
problems in the oil industry the allowance has decreased as housing 
prices have dropped 
stevens was particularly angered by the pentagons recent 
decision to distribute 77 million in surplus allowances equally 
among all recipients rather than targeting those who have had their 
allowance cut 
this is the most unfair system ive ever seen stevens said 
dr david j berteau deputy assistant secretary of defense for 
resource management and support barely getting a word in said the 
effect of penalizing those in the southwest and alaska is the 
exception rather than the rule 
stevens also criticized the fiscal 1990 budgets proposed level 
of 3609 billion for stationing military personnel and their 
dependents overseas an increase of nearly 10 percent over the 
3289 billion earmarked for fiscal 1989 
he argued against upgrading housing facilities overseas at the 
same time the defense department will be closing bases and troops 
may be reduced if the nato alliance reaches an agreement with the 
warsaw pact to reduce manpower in europe 
whats more he said the number of military dependents is 
expected to remain constant at about 473000 
but berteau responding to stevens statement that many military 
personnel in japan and west germany employee servants said 
those increases are targeted very specifically at a hugh chunk 
of lower enlisted who dont have the kind of money that can support 
their dependents in any manner that you described with servants and 
maids 
stevens replied 
i think its unreal to put us in a position of closing down 
production lines for new systems and building new quarters 
overseas 
berteau then told the senator that many are in very sad shape 
and argued that better facilities are necessary to maintain high 
morale attract recruits and keep them in the services 
but stevens said theyve been living in these quarters for 10 
years and in this very tight budget year you decide to build new 
ones

remove crate and store the panels said ron mcqueen assistant 
director of the state department of general administration 
the state paid 100000 to have the murals created in 1981 but 
some lawmakers found them inappropriate for the building or were 
offended by the murals nudity the artwork represents the 12 tasks 
performed by the mythological figure hercules to obtain immortality

a group of lawmakers urged president bush on 
thursday to raise us concerns over alleged human rights abuses in 
east timor during his white house meeting friday with indonesian 
president suharto 
our concern is that failure to mention the situation in east 
timor would signal a lack of united states attention to the serious 
human rights and humanitarian issues in that troubled territory 
100 house democrats and 18 republicans told bush in a letter 
they said severe human rights abuses including executions rape 
and beatings are a recurring problem in the former portuguese 
colony east timor was invaded by indonesia in 1975 and annexed the 
following year

nugzar ruhadze has no inhibitions when it comes to 
questioning americans about their capitalist lifestyles 
take the time the soviet reporter on loan to an atlanta 
television station asked a construction worker if his family was 
proud of his job as a manual laborer or when he asked an uptown 
mansion owner if she was ashamed of being wealthy 
always i go back to the office and they tell me we cant 
believe you asked that ruhadze said but i am surprised that 
they are surprised i ask questions if i want to know but maybe you 
would rather not know than maybe embarrass somebody with a 
question 
embarrassed or not both interview subjects answered the 
questions about their social status the laborer said his family 
indeed was proud of him the wealthy woman confessed to sometimes 
feeling shame 
ruhadze the first soviet journalist to work for an american tv 
station airs such brash reports three times a week on wxia 
television 
the journalist from soviet georgia can find similarities between 
soviet and american culture everywhere even in memorial day which 
he compared to the day of victory celebrated in the soviet union 
yes we do it in very much the same way he whispered 
huskily these days remind you were not rid of wars they can 
still occur i saw this old veteran he was crying sobbing a hero 
of war but he showed the wounds had not healed 
ruhadze 47 said he hopes such reports during his visit to 
atlanta will help dispel distrust still inherent in many soviets and 
americans 
i have a boy 3 and i want him never to be afraid of anything 
called american he said i want him to take that as part of his 
own culture which is called human 
his reports often center on cultural differences 
there are so many he said things you take for granted 
like nursing homes i can never imagine my mother whos 71 living 
out of my home even if there was the most luxurious nursing home 
wxia operations manager billy otwell said ruhadzes reports are 
unusual because they do not have scripts although ruhadze speaks 
fluent english he had no experience in american news coverage 
so ruhadzes producers tape his conversations with americans and 
then interview him about what he thought was most interesting in the 
story those taped edited comments form his stories 
in one such story his conversation with local teenagers on the 
differences between soviet and american high schools touched on the 
problem of teen pregnancy 
i asked them why girls were always in a hurry to become women 
when as soon as they are women they want to be girls again he 
said they just laughed they couldnt answer that it shows a 
problem 
usually though ruhadze can find a good side to many of the 
problems he discovers in american society 
everybody here tries to live in separate houses he said 
but to do that they are in debt this is a credit society you 
are always in debt 
but maybe that is good he added you know you have to 
work and that is good 
ruhadze who is host of a talk show in tbilisi called 
roundtable will be in atlanta until june 23 as part of wxias 
exchange program with atlantas sister city tbilisi reporter 
simeon smith traveled to soviet georgia earlier this spring among 
other things he filmed a rash of antigovernment ethnic riots that 
broke out while he was there 
otwell said the station tries to air reports smith made during 
his trip in conjunction with ruhadzes look at the same topics 
like driving styles 
the soviet driving is bad simeon would close his eyes he 
was scared out of his guts ruhadze said but here the traffic 
is heavy of course but its not dangerous if you do defensive 
driving 
one topic ruhadze wants to take up before he leaves is american 
funerals and the modern cemetery with no tombstones above ground 
i saw what i call a new american cemetery he said it was 
a beautiful hillock with beautiful flowers when i stopped i saw a 
big plate in the ground 
i just stopped and sat there he added this showed the 
american way of life they save the land save money and make all 
people equal

polish voters have rejected prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski and 32 other top officials of the communist 
coalition who ran unopposed in elections according to official 
results released today 
the results by the national election commission indicated that 33 
of the 35 high officials of the communist party and its allies were 
rejected in the parliamentary election sunday the candidates failed 
to get the 50 percent of the vote required because many citizens 
crossed out their names on the ballot 
despite their losses rakowski and the others will retain their 
regular government posts but the victory by solidarity candidates 
gives the opposition power to veto legislation and even prevent that 
veto from being overridden 
only two coalition candidates were were elected peasant party 
member mikolaj kozakiewicz who is a communist ally but who has 
gained a reputation for independence and communist administrative 
law judge adam zielinski 
the results were released as solidarity leader lech walesa was in 
warsaw to meet with interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak and 
other officials to discuss how the rejected candidates might be 
seated in spite of their defeat 
solidaritys candidates won an overwhelming victory in eastern 
europes first democratic parliamentary elections in 40 years the 
union led the opposition after it was legalized under a pact with 
the government 
in all 165 deputies were elected to the 460member sejm or 
lower house in the first round 160 from solidarity and five from 
the communist or allied parties in the new freely elected 
100member senate 92 senators were picked in the first round all 
from solidarity 
besides kozakiewicz and zielinski from the communist party list 
just three party or allied candidates running for 264 contested 
seats reserved for the party coalition managed to get 50 percent in 
the first round the other 261 will be decided in runoffs june 18 
by comparison only one of the solidaritybacked candidates to 
the sejm running for 161 seats reserved for the opposition failed to 
get more than 50 percent in the first round 
solidarity hopes to win that seat and the eight remaining senate 
seats in the second round it also says it will back certain 
sympathetic communist or allied candidates in the runoff to build on 
its electoral success 
solidarity has indicated it would like to find a compromise to 
seat the rejected communist officials in keeping with its previous 
agreement to allow the communists and their allies 65 percent of the 
sejm the union is also worried the sejm might lose its importance 
if top party leaders were absent 
in addition to rakowski and kiszczak the seven other members of 
the 17member politburo who were on the communist coalition were 
also rejected 
polands leader gen wojciech jaruzelski was quoted today by a 
british newspaper the independent as conceding that election 
results were not favorable to the communist polish united 
workers party 
but he was quoted as saying the outcome would not hinder the 
bold historical experiment we have begun and calling for further 
dialogue and compromise it was jaruzelskis first public 
comments on the election 
he also said the next parliamentary election set for 1993 
should be totally free and that the communist party would have to 
consider relinquishing power in poland if its candidates again lose

three allegedly killed or robbed for radical causes one was 
accused of killing a police officer one was charged with poisoning 
his estranged wifes drink 
they are five fbi fugitives wanted longer than john emil list 
the churchgoing accountant authorities say was arrested in virginia 
last week for the 1971 fatal shootings of his wife mother and three 
children in westfield nj 
as in the list case investigators are hoping to pry these 
fugitives from their new lives 
they follow leads thicken files contact colleagues around the 
world and prepare their cases as proposals for the television show 
americas most wanted the fugitive showcase that prompted a tip 
leading to lists arrest 
list who claims he is robert p clark was turned over to the 
custody of virginia authorities today and ordered back in court july 
6 for a hearing on new jerseys request for extradition 
the fbi maintains a file of about 100 longterm fugitives 
including the 10 most wanted deemed worthy of special attention 
most of these cases have reached dead ends 
there becomes a time when youre literally down to publicity 
said thomas bush northeast supervisor for the fbis fugitive unit 
in washington dc youve done every kind of record check you can 
do 
if such longterm fugitives have anything in common its a 
different kind of personality that allows them to cut all ties 
with relatives and their past said bush who has been chasing 
fugitives for a decade 
the oldest case on the books is perhaps most tantalizing for law 
enforcement officials 
joseph michael maloney went to his estranged wifes house one day 
in 1967 in rochester ny for their sons fifth birthday party 
the next day june fisk maloney went to a hospital feeling ill and 
died a few days later 
police allege maloney served his wife an orange juice cocktail 
poisoned with wood alcohol 
it was an especially horrible death said monroe county 
district attorney howard relin 
maloney was arrested but escaped from a hospital while undergoing 
psychiatric tests and moved to ireland apparently in the early 
1970s he changed his name to michael oshea married and fathered 
two children authorities said 
he was under surveillance for 11 years in anticipation of an 
extradition treaty with the united states irish authorities said 
in 1985 he was arrested but irelands high court overturned the 
treaty and maloney was freed relin said recent reports have placed 
the 53yearold former handyman and builder in canada 
relin now is seeking help from americas most wanted 
another case being prepared for the program does not go back as 
far as the list case but it is strikingly similar 
william bradford bishop jr 52 a former foreign service 
officer is wanted for the 1976 bludgeoning deaths of his wife 
mother and three sons at their home in potomac md an affluent 
washington dc suburb 
bishop like list is well remembered in his old community 
you mention bradford bishop around here to anyone whos a 
longtime resident theyll know said montgomery county police 
officer george ludington 
the four other fugitives are 
george ernesto lopez 39 wanted for the 1969 fatal shooting of 
a san francisco police officer investigating a burglary ring 
leo frederick burt 41 wanted for the 1970 vietnam war protest 
bombing of a building housing the army mathematics research center 
at the university of wisconsin in madison a researcher inside was 
killed 
richard b thomas 43 wanted for the 1970 slaying of a 
philadelphia park police sergeant and the wounding of a patrolman 
he was a member of a group called the black unity movement 
katherine ann power 40 wanted for driving a getaway car in 
connection with the 1970 robbery of 26585 from a boston bank 
where a police officer was killed in a burst of gunfire the robbery

in response to the chinese crisis the us 
governments voice of america is beaming television signals to the 
peoples republic the first time it has ever taken such a step the 
director said thursday 
the signal is going directly to about 2000 satellite dishes 
operated largely by the peoples liberation army although there is 
no way to tell whether the transmission is being watched by the 
military or passed along other channels said voa director richard 
carlson 
the us embassy is receiving the signal loud and clear on a 
satellite dish in beijing he said the transmission began tuesday 
the broadcast of news to the military is significant because of 
reports that units backing the prodemocracy demonstrators may have 
exchanged fire with units supporting the crackdown 
we are sending a television signal that is available to every 
major military installation in china carlson told the associated 
press in a telephone interview the signal originates in the united 
states and bounces off satellites over the indian and pacific 
oceans covering all of china 
it makes available to the chinese military information about 
what is going on in china information that may not otherwise be 
available to the chinese military he said 
television and radio sets are not built to receive direct 
satellite signals the transmissions must be received by satellite 
dishes and rebroadcast in a signal accessible to individual 
receivers said carlson 
the voa which broadcasts radio programs in many languages around 
the world including transmissions targeted at communist nations 
has never used a television signal before said carlson 
it seemed like the right thing to do said carlson who made 
the decision and informed a special state department task force 
monitoring events in china the state deparment is aware of it no 
one has objected 
the voa normally beams eight hours of radio broadcasts daily in 
mandarin to china but increased that to 11 hours in response to the 
student demonstrations in beijing 
chinese authorities have said that we have a regular listening 
audience of 60 million we believe that we are over 100 million now 
we are clearly the most pervasive nonchinese source of news in the 
country said carlson 
voas television image shows a broadcaster reading the news as 
the chineselanguage script scrolls across the lower part of the 
screen voa has not attempted to broadcast television images of the 
demonstrations or the aftermath 
during the unrest said carlson chinese authorities have tried 
to jam voa chinese radio broadcasts they have not tried to jam 
voas english language broadcasts 
voa maintains a bureau with two correspondents in beijing and 
uses other western news services which have been reporting a 
different story than the official chinese media 
the chinese media have been very dishonest about the student 
demonstrations and the role of the military said carlson 
chinese media have said there were 300 dead and that they were 
mostly soldiers which is not true the red cross says 3000 people 
died he said some western sources in beijing have estimated the 
dead at 7000

a house panel chairman thursday distributed 
federal data identifying 205 industrial plants as increasing cancer 
risks through release of airborne toxic chemicals the environmental 
protection agency quickly disputed his interpretations 
an epa spokesman said the information was old and incomplete and 
complained it was highly irresponsible to use it as reflective 
of risks in the real world 
however rep henry a waxman chairman of the house energy and 
commerce environment subcommittee said that even potentially 
inaccurate figures should be released because they indicate the 
enormity of the problem and represent a stunning demonstration 
of the urgency of the public health threat 
waxman dcalif said at a news conference that toxic chemicals 
present a cancer risk near the plants at least a thousandfold 
greater than levels accepted by experts 
the plants on the list compiled by the epa pose at least a 
1in1000 cancer risk to people getting maximum exposure for a 
lifetime while the epa deems a risk of more than 1inamillion as 
unacceptable 
its public information rep guy v molinari rny told 
the news conference in defending release of the data the public 
has a right to know added rep mickey leland dtexas 
leland molinari waxman and rep jerry sikorski dminn 
combined release of the figures with an announcement that they have 
introduced legislation to control airborne toxic chemical releases 
the bill would limit emissions from industrial sources and motor 
vehicles attempt to prevent accidental releases protect the great 
lakes which have been seriously damaged by airborne toxic 
chemicals and control emissions from small businesses waxman plans 
to incorporate the legislation into a comprehensive clean air bill 
that also would address urban pollution and acid rain 
the bush administration is expected to introduce its own clean 
air proposals next week including what epa spokesman david cohen 
described as a strong air toxics component 
cohen said the data on the individual facilities were complied to 
develop computer models to compare health risks from one plant to 
another 
the figures were never used to reflect risks in the real 
world cohen said and any suggestion those data are reflective 
of risks in the real world is an entirely erroneous interpretation 
a highly irresponsible interpretation 
the chemical manufacturers association said to imply that 
these estimates depict the real risks of living near one of the 
plants is not just exaggeration but an outright misuse of data to 
deliberately alarm people 
the estimates assume a 70year lifetime exposure to a chemical at 
its maximum exposure level at a plant 
the figures indicated that 205 facilities posed cancer risks for 
the most exposed individuals that may exceed 1 in 1000 fortyfive 
of these facilities had maximum individual risks of greater than 1 
in 100 and one had at least a 1in10 risk 
the estimates represent evaluations of the maximum individual 
cancer risk that might arise from the inhalation of a single toxic 
air pollutant from an individual facility 
for example a risk estimate of 1 in 1000 means that one person 
out of 1000 could be expected to contract cancer from maximum 
exposure to a single pollutant 
waxman said that because of the potential inaccuracy of the data 
he didnt know whether the problems at individual plants should be 
considered worse than the figures showed or on the other hand 
not serious but he said there is a real possibility the problem 
is worse than indicated because the data were limited 
for instance the information only measures cancer risks but not 
other potential hazards such as birth defects nervous system damage 
or respiratory disease 
the figures also do not reflect the combined cancer risk of 
different air toxics that might be released by a single plant 
also only the cancer risk from direct inhalation of air toxics 
is evaluated although numerous studies indicate the potential 
contamination of crops in nearby areas or accumulation of toxics in 
the food chain can exceed the risk from breathing the chemicals 
in addition the epa did not evaluate some toxics including 
benzene and coke oven emissions 
the epa said the worst plant on the list was the texaco butadiene 
plant in port neches texas with at least a 1in10 risk of cancer 
texaco labeled the estimate totally unsupported by any 
technical and scientific facts or by employee health records

the united states opened a new round of 
talks with the plo thursday by urging it to support an israeli 
proposal for elections in the occupied lands but the two sides 
remained sharply at odds 
for its part israel said the usplo talks were hindering the 
peace process 
after 4 hours of private discussions in tunis negotiators for 
washington and the palestine liberation organization expressed 
satisfaction with progress the head of the plo delegation yasser 
abdrabbou said more talks will be held in the near future 
however a senior american official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it was more of the same from the plo 
both abdrabbou and the chief us delegate robert pelletreau 
jr read statements after their meeting thursday they contained no 
major shifts in position however 
the major focus of our dialogue today was the concept of 
elections in the occupied territories to launch a political 
negotiating process to deal with both transitional arrangements and 
final status said pelletreau who also serves as us ambassador 
to tunisia 
he stressed the us governments view that the israeli proposal 
for elections in the occupied territories were constructive and 
workable deserving of a positive palestinian response 
the plan calls for the 17 million palestinians in the 
israelioccupied territories to elect representatives to negotiate 
with israel for autonomy later talks would determine the final 
status of the west bank and gaza strip but israel has said an 
independent palestinian state is out of the question 
the plo which has declared a palestinian state has rejected the 
israeli plan for elections it says the israelis must first withdraw 
from the occupied territories and agree to an international observer 
force 
in his statement thursday abdrabbou said the plo delegation 
urged the bush administration to take clear and decisive measures 
to stop the terrorist measures taken by israel in the occupied 
territories 
these measures lead to more and more deaths destruction and 
deterioration of the condition in which the population has to 
live he said 
more than 500 palestinians have been killed in the 18monthold 
uprising against israeli rule most in clashes with israeli 
soldiers twentytwo israelis also have died 
abdrabbou also called for an international conference on 
bringing peace to the region 
in his reaction to the talks thursday israel foreign minister 
moshe arens said the plo is the obstacle to free elections 
so contacts with them make things more difficult they dont 
help he told israel radio 
talking with them which gives them a feeling of legitimacy and 
recognition only makes the peace process more difficult arens 
said 
israel views the plo as a terrorist group 
the united states agreed to talk directly to the plo last 
december after plo chief yasser arafat said his group was renouncing 
terrorism thursdays discussions were the third round

a lawyer for a teenager who had his 
drivers license revoked for dropping out of school says the states 
antitruancy law clashes with other state statutes making the new 
law unconstitutional 
he dropped out of high school legally because theres a statute 
that says when youre 16 you can drop out attorney chris butch 
said the new law is in direct conflict of that the one law 
doesnt jibe with the other 
under an education reform law passed by the west virginia 
legislature last summer students under age 18 who miss more than 10 
consecutive days of school or have 15 unexcused absences must give 
up their driving privileges 
proponents of the law which is aimed at curbing truancy in a 
state where the dropout rate hovers around 17 percent point to 
department of motor vehicle figures that show 100 of the 353 
students who lost their license through december returned to school 
michael means a 17yearold ninthgrade dropout took his case 
to kanawha county circuit court on wednesday marking the first time 
the statute has been challenged in court he filed a lawsuit against 
dmv commissioner george sidiropolis and the agency seeking to 
declare the law unconstitutional 
a trial was set for june 21 
means whose 16yearold wife tonya is pregnant says he cant 
get a job without driving and therefore cant provide for his 
family 
what im try to accomplish with the lawsuit is to get his 
license back so he can function as an adult butch said 
tom madden a department of motor vehicles attorney said the 
agency had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment 
means dropped out of roosevelt junior high school in charleston a 
year ago in october means misplaced his license and requested a 
new one the dmv wouldnt agree without the consent of the kanawha 
county board of education which refused on may 30 the license was 
revoked 
a hardship clause exists in the law that allows county board of 
educations to make some exceptions however school officials have 
said that means could have worked and still completed his education 
i think the law is ignorant said michaels father william 
it shouldnt have had to go this far hopefully it will get his 
license back and get the law declared unconstitutional 
butch added that under a 1973 state attorney generals opinion 
if a person is married and under the age of 18 the state considers 
that person to be freed from parental control 
that has been the law in this state for a long period of 
time he said it was for the kids who werent too good in 
school and who went to work on farms or in the mines 
however del pat murphy dberkeley who introduced the 
legislation in 1988 said his law is designed to keep kids in school 
and help those who have to work get their educations 
what i do not want to see is the bill turned into a law that 
encourages young people to go out and get married so they can quit 
school and fall into the category of an emancipated youth murphy

much more needs to be done to develop 
communitybased services for the growing number of children with 
mental health problems tipper gore said thursday 
mrs gore wife of sen albert gore jr dtenn said that at 
a time when we have a great deal of education talent skills 
research we have a service delivery system that emphasizes 
hospitalization in fact some kids are sent out of state to be 
hospitalized because theres a lack of communitybased mental 
health services 
the goal ought to be to keep the child in the family in the 
home in the community if possible she said so we need a 
commitment to funding for communitybased mental health services 
that are childcentered 
she was interviewed during a capitol hill conference by the 
national mental health association and the child mental health 
interest group an organization that involves the wives of several 
members of congress and is chaired by mrs gore 
an institute of medicine study reported wednesday that mental 
disorder among children is a problem costing society billions of 
dollars and depriving the nation of productive citizens 
the report gave a conservative estimate of 12 percent of 
americas children being mentally disturbed but it added that the 
true number could be as high as 22 percent or about 14 million 
at the conference dr joseph coyle director of child psychiatry 
at the johns hopkins school of medicine and a member of the 
committee that carried out the institute of medicine study said it 
was not presumptuous to recommend substantial increases for 
funding of research into mental disorders of children at a time of 
budget deficits and government programtightening 
sen gore called the situation with child mental health a 
problem that urgently needs attention he said that in coping with 
it inevitably theres this tremendous inertia that society has to 
get over with 
mrs gore said that state government agencies across the country 
need to take a more active role in coordinating the services and 
funds available for assisting mentally disturbed children

a soviet mig29 fighter crashed during an aerobatic 
performance thursday on the opening day of the paris air show and 
the pilot was injured after bailing out of the jet 
the aircraft was making its final pass over le bourget airfield 
north of paris after a dramatic demonstration flight when a part of 
the aircraft appeared to break away 
pieces of the needlenosed jet burst into flames while the 
fuselage in one piece dropped like a stone in the center of the 
airfield without injuring any of the thousands of exhibitors 
visitors and jouralists on hand for opening day 
a water tanker and fire engines rushed to the scene to douse the 
flames of the burning fuselage 
the pilot 37yearold anatoly kvochur was airlifted by 
helicopter to hospital near the airstrip then transferred to begin 
military hospital in a suburb east of the city the soviet embassy 
in paris said he was in fairly good health 
claude martin flight director of the show said kvochurs 
parachute barely opened but even so it broke the fall of the 
pilot 
air show spokesman patrick guerin said the pilot suffered serious 
injuries including injury to his stomach but was conscious and 
talked during the airlift to the military hospital 
the soviet news agency tass carried a report on the incident and 
videotape was shown on soviet tv thursday night 
alexander batkov soviet department chief for the ministry of 
aviation industry said in paris that kvochur is one of our best 
pilots 
no immediate cause was given for the crash batkov said it was 
only the second mig29 ever to crash 
specialists must analyze the situation batkov said when 
we see the film well know what happened it is too early to ask 
questions yet 
guerin said the plane seemed to have a mechanical problem with 
the left engine he said the afterburner of the left engine failed 
to fire during a lowspeed turn at about 1000 feet 
one industry official said the pilot appeared to be pushing the 
plane to its limits before the crash 
john w wood jr president of thermedics inc of woburn mass 
said the plane was making a very high performance routine 
including vertical climbs straight up solely on engine power 
without relying on wing lift 
john klinghut manager of operations for the usa national 
pavilion who witnessed the crash said the pilot apparently lost 
an engine 
he was about 500 feet in the air there was a big burst of 
flames and a lot of smoke klinghut said 
the accident occurred about two hours after president francois 
mitterrand inaugurated the worlds most prestigious aviation show 
which opens to the public on friday 
on display are a large number of soviet aircraft including the 
new space shuttle buran 
the mig29 a twinengine combat aircraft has been used since 
1985 and represents a clear effort by the soviet union to close the 
technology gap with the west batkov said it was first displayed 
last year at britains farnborough air show where it also was 
piloted by kvochur 
the worst recent accident at the paris air show was in 1973 when 
a soviet supersonic tupolev 144 exploded in flight killing the 
sixman crew and seven people in the nearby village of 
goussainville where it hit the ground 
the last previous accident at the show held every two years was 
in 1977 when an american singleseat twinengine a10 passed too low 
while making a loop and hit the ground 
on aug 28 1988 70 people died after three italian air force 
stunt jets collided at a ramstein air base air show in west germany 
one plane plowed into spectators at the event

pilot error appears the most likely 
cause of the crash of a surinamese jetliner that struck a tree and 
tore to pieces trying to land in thick fog a government spokesman 
said thursday 
he said three americans flying the plane who all died in 
wednesdays crash gave no radio warning of any problem before the 
surinam airways jet went down near this capitals international 
airport 
the governmentrun suriname news agency said the death toll was 
expected to reach 177 there were 11 known survivors who were 
initially taken to a city hospital but their condition was unclear 
the airline gave no figure thursday for the number of people 
already known to be dead saying families must first be notified 
rescue workers were searching thursday for six bodies still in 
the wreckage 
six investigators from the us national transportation safety 
board arrived in paramaribo at the request of the surinamese 
government to help investigate why the dc8 crashed it was leased 
from an unidentified us company to surinam airways 
the cause of the accident was uncertain however government 
spokesman kenneth schoon said we think it was pilot error but we 
wont know for sure until the flight recorder is examined 
commercial aircraft carry cockpit recorders that record inflight 
conversations and a flight data recorder that registers altitude 
wind speed and other data 
the crash was the worst air disaster in the history of the former 
dutch colony on the northern coast of south america the plane was 
flying from the netherlands 
schoon said the three americans in the cockpit did not report an 
emergency but circled the runway twice before asking the control 
tower for more light on the runway 
that was the last we heard of them schoon said 
the airline identified the americans as capt will rogers 
copilot glyn tobias and engineer warren rose their hometowns were 
unavailable 
motilal atta mungra the airlines director said the company had 
virtually ruled out technical problems because the 20yearold plane 
had a maintenance check just two weeks ago 
he said the plane caught fire after hitting a tree and breaking 
into pieces its midsection landed upsidedown and debris was 
strewn over 150 yards 
mungra said there were 188 people aboard 
about 60 bodies of identified victims were being flown thursday 
along with three badly burned survivors to amsterdam schoon said 
other bodies were stored for identification in a temporary morgue at 
the airport 
the dead included three highranking surinamese military officers 
and three dutch soccer players of surinamese origin 
most passengers were people from suriname living in the 
netherlands

arab gunmen forced their way into a hospital in 
the occupied west bank at dawn thursday and assassinated a 
palestinian suspected of collaborating with israel 
arab reports said the squad used a gun with a silencer to kill 
55yearold taleb yamin he was hospitalized after an attack last 
week in which he was beaten and stabbed 
in a second slaying a palestinian suspected of cooperating with 
israeli authorities was shot in the head by arab attackers 
arab reports said the victim 48yearold fayel fawalha was 
given first aid by israeli soldiers and evacuated by an army 
helicopter the army said fawalha died later at israels tel 
hashomer hospital 
also thursday a 13yearold palestinian boy was shot and killed 
by a military patrol arab hospital officials said arab reports 
said there were no clashes between troops and palestinian 
stonethrowers at the time and that it was not clear what provoked 
the shooting 
all three shootings occurred in the west bank town of nablus 
the army spokeswoman confirmed the slayings of the men and said 
police were investigating she said officials were checking reports 
of the boys death 
foreign minister moshe arens termed the attacks the latest 
examples of a plo reign of terror in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
he also said israel considers the us dialogue with the plo as 
encouragement to the plo and an impediment to peace the plous 
talks resumed thursday in tunis 
the plo is the obstacle to peace in the region arens said on 
israel radio talking with them gives them a feeling of legitimacy 
and recognition and makes the peace process more difficult 
in the fatal attack at rafidiyeh hospital a group of people 
entered the hospital at 5 am said dr abdel rahman shinar the 
hospitals director they forced a male nurse and a relative to 
leave the room then they opened fire killing him instantly 
another doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity said yamin 
was shot once in the head arab reports said the gang was armed with 
a gun with a silencer 
the slayings of the men brought to 50 the number of palestinians 
killed by other arabs since the uprising against israeli rule in the 
occupied territories began in december 1987 most have been accused 
of helping israeli authorities or of drug dealing or prostitution 
all three deaths brought to 512 the number of palestinians killed 
in the 18monthold rebellion most in clashes with israeli 
soldiers twentytwo israelis also have died 
in the gaza strip israeli soldiers on thursday sealed the homes 
of three palestinians accused of throwing firebombs at troops 
a day earlier the army blew up one house and sealed another 
belonging to palestinians suspected in firebomb attacks 
the united states and human rights groups have denounced the 
practice saying it violates the right to due process because those 
punished usually have not been charged or tried 
an 18yearold palestinian was reported wounded in the leg in a 
clash with troops in jebaliya in the gaza strip which remained 
under curfew for the fifth consecutive day 
the curfew was lifted for two hours thursday to allow the strips 
700000 residents to buy food 
meanwhile vice president dan quayle urged israel to halt all 
settlement activity in the occupied lands and suggested that even 
talking about such plans was harmful to peace 
these announcements of new settlements are politically 
problematic even if they dont go through with it quayle said in 
an interview with the englishlanguage jerusalem post newspaper 
its something i wish there was a sensitivity to he said 
in an unusually blunt speech last month secretary of state james 
a baker iii lashed out at the settlements saying they were a bar 
to peace 
more than 130 settlements housing about 70000 jews have been 
built in the territories home to 17 million palestinians 
a public opinion survey published thursday indicated 53 percent 
of israelis would object to dismantling the settlements as part of a 
peace agreement but 42 percent of the 579 respondents favored their 
removal 
the poll was conducted this week by the dahaf institute and 
carried in the yediot ahronot daily no margin of error for the poll 
was given

the senate foreign relations committee 
permitted to act by the settlement of a partisan dispute within its 
ranks sent a 25 billion state department authorization bill to 
the senate on thursday but left some arguments over spending 
priorities unresolved 
the panel also recommended the senate confirm four pending 
diplomatic nominations including that of former sen chic hecht 
rnev to become ambassador to the bahamas 
the committee had been hamstrung by a republican boycott of its 
business meetings reflecting gop anger over a democraticled probe 
into the past activities of donald gregg named by president bush to 
be ambassador to south korea 
the gregg controversy temporarily set aside the committee faced 
problems involving spending choices that must be made 
under a budget deal reached by the bush administration and 
congress combined foreign affairs spending for state department 
funding and foreign aid was set at 19 billion 
but the administration requested total spending of nearly 198 
billion 
the crunch came when sen jesse helms rnc sought to fund 
192 million for new and powerful voice of america transmitters in 
israel by stripping money from accounts set aside to pay past and 
present us dues to united nations organizations 
chairman claiborne pell dri contended it is important the 
united states meet its un obligations especially when funds are 
needed for vital international peacekeeping operations 
refusing to pay would brand the united states as an 
international deadbeat pell said 
but helms said it was vastly more important to build these 
transmitters than to ship a whole hat full of money up to that crowd 
at the united nations 
other panel members contended spending for the transmitter 
project could be slowed because the soviet union has stopped 
electronic jamming of voice of america broadcasts jamming that the 
new transmitters were designed to overcome 
in the end the panel decided not to decide at least for the 
moment 
by voice vote it approved full funding for the transmitters 
then it voted not to take the money out of us dues to the 
united nations 
it then sent the bill to the senate floor for further action at a 
funding level 792 million above the budget ceiling 
we will have to wrestle this to the ground further down the 
road said sen richard lugar rind 
he and other senators expressed hope the administration will set 
priorities and make choices needed to get foreign affairs spending 
into balance 
the panel also voted to recommend the senate approve bushs 
nominations of 
bernard aronson to be assistant secretary of state for latin 
american affairs 
john kelly to be assistant secretary for middle eastern and 
south asian affairs 
john negroponte to be ambassador to mexico 
hecht to be ambassador to the bahamas 
sen mitch mcconnell rky said he organized the gop boycott 
because he feared a campaign of delays and leaks was being 
mounted to prevent any action on the gregg nomination 
a committee investigation into greggs background was spurred by 
sen alan cranston dcalif cranston said that gregg while 
national security adviser to thenvice president bush may have 
helped in an illegal effort to resupply the nicaraguan contra rebels 
with weapons and ammunition 
mcconnell and cranston resolved the impasse on wednesday after 
administration officials promised to supply documents cranston had 
requested 
cranston will hold a second day of underoath testimony on june 
15 a guaranteed committee vote on gregg now is set for june 20 
cranston told reporters he is satisfied with the result and 
satisfied that the administration has made a goodfaith 
commitment to deliver the requested documents as promised 
were going to vote on the 20th he said if people arent 
satisfied with what we receive they can vote present or no 
cranston said he remains skeptical about greggs denials that he 
had no involvement in oliver l norths attempts to resupply the 
contras 
up to this point ive found mr greggs version hard to 
accept cranston said

syrian gunners shelled the christian 
enclave north of beirut on thursday as three arab foreign ministers 
opened talks in syria to try to end three months of fighting in 
lebanon 
police said two civilians were wounded during the sporadic 
daylong hostilities 
syrian gunners deployed in moslem west beirut fired more than 
100 howitzer shells in an apparent effort to prevent christian army 
commander gen michel aoun from receiving arms supplies by sea 
police said 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules 
said the shells exploded around the christian ports of jounieh and 
byblos 
aouns gunners entrenched in the 310squaremile enclave 
unleashed a howitzer barrage at sundown aimed at syrian gun 
positions in west beiruts seaside district police reported 
its a limited retaliation aimed at the sources of syrian 
fire said a communique from aouns headquarters 
the police spokesman said gun battles broke out at nightfall 
between syrian and christian units across beiruts dividing green 
line in the battlescarred old commercial district straddling the 
port 
the latest round of fighting in lebanons 14year civil war began 
on march 8 since then 363 people have been killed and 1432 
wounded 
in the syrian capital president hafez assad met with foreign 
ministers abdel latif alfilali of morocco bouallam bsayeh of 
algeria and prince saud alfaisal of saudi arabia who delivered a 
message from their leaders on lebanon syria has long considered 
lebanon within its sphere of influence 
alfilali said in a statementwe hope to find soon a final 
solution to the lebanese problem 
the three nations were chosen at an arab summit conference in 
casablanca morocco to come up with a peace plan within six months 
to end the civil war 
the foreign ministers are to travel later to baghdad for talks 
with iraqi officials on the confrontation between aouns 20000 
troops and syrias 40000 soldiers 
president saddam hussein of iraq syrias main arab foe had 
declared support for aouns war of liberation against the 
syrians 
the current round of fighting began after aoun ordered a blockade 
of illegal ports run by syrianbacked militias south of beirut 
because they deprive the state treasury of about 100 million in 
customs dues annually 
syrian troops and allied militiamen of druse warlord walid 
jumblatts progressive socialist party retaliated by blockading the 
christian enclave where about 1 million people live 
the arab league called a ceasefire on may 26 but it has not been 
honored 
aoun on wednesday called the confrontation a war for 
sovereignty nothing more nothing less 
his remarks at a military graduation ceremony were published by 
the independent daily newspaper annahar 
aoun also called for the withdrawal of israeli forces that 
control along with allied militias a six to 10mile buffer zone 
in southern lebanon to prevent guerrilla attacks on northern israeli 
settlements 
syria troops are stationed across 70 percent of lebanon under a 
1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
aoun and other christian leaders accuse the syrians of failing in 
their mandate by siding with moslems against christians in the civil 
war 
the leftist daily newspaper assafir said syrian vice president 
abdul halim khaddam wednesday dismissed aoun as not a man of 
dialogue he does not have a clearcut political horizon 
it said khaddam made the remarks in damascus to a delegation from 
lebanons syriancontrolled northern province of akkar 
khaddam said syrian troops were prepared to remain in lebanon 
for another 14 years if need be to achieve justice 
he was referring to political reforms demanded by syrianbacked 
moslem leaders who have been fighting fellow christians since 1975 
to achieve equality in running lebanons affairs

about two dozen baltic parliamentarians angry about 
central control of their republics stormed out of the congress 
thursday in a dramatic demonstration that lawmakers are no longer 
cogs in the kremlin machinery 
comrades comrades i ask you to be calm because this is not 
all so simple an exasperated president mikhail s gorbachev cried 
as the deputies left the kremlins palace of congresses 
it was the first walkout of the raucous congress of peoples 
deputies session that began may 25 and is scheduled to end friday 
and it underscored the increasingly unpredictable nature of kremlin 
politics 
it also reflected the heated opposition by some deputies to the 
communist party establishment that runs the session and nominates 
committee members and other officials 
in other tough talk thursday a radical economist said the 
country should cut aid to the kremlins latin american allies and 
pay farmers foreign currency to help avert economic collapse 
another deputy said the country was on the brink of ecological 
disaster 
soviet television which broadcast the session live to millions 
showed about 25 deputies storming out 
the baltic legislators made the dramatic move after objecting to 
formation of a committee by the 2250member congress that will 
decide whether laws conform to the soviet constitution they said 
the committee could encroach on their republics right to 
selfdetermination and ability to veto laws passed by the central 
government 
our electors ordered us to take care of the sovereignty of our 
republics said romas v gudaitis a writer and deputy from 
lithuania we consider the elections of the constitutional 
inspection committee to be without purpose and we will not take part 
in them 
gudaitis called the committee a remnant of the stalin empire 
and part of moscows attempts to control and oppress national 
problems by an iron glove 
lithuanian deputies among the most vocal at the parliamentary 
session led the walkout the tass news agency reported tass said 
representatives of the two other baltic republics estonia and 
latvia also objected to the committee but it was not immediately 
clear if they joined the lithuanian walkout 
the congress voted overwhelmingly to form the committee on 
thursday but 433 deputies were against and 61 abstained including 
lithuanias delegation gorbachev said he would consult with the 
deputies who objected and that the congress would vote on the 
committee membership friday morning 
the baltic representatives contend the soviet takeover of their 
nations in 1940 went against the peoples will and believe 
moscowbased ministries have ruined their environment and economy 
many baltic residents are demanding autonomy from moscow in all but 
defense and security 
in a direct clash with the kremlin the legislatures of estonia 
and lithuania have proclaimed the right to veto laws approved by the 
central government in moscow 
later thursday gorbachev told reporters to leave the hall and 
asked that tv cameras be turned off the congress then went into its 
first closed session its topic undisclosed 
alexei yastrebov a deputy from the ural mountains area of 
russia said in a telephone interview the closed session involved 
discussion of violence in uzbekistan 
at least 71 people have been killed in a fiveday rampage 
involving ethnic uzbeks and the meskhi turk minority in the southern 
soviet republic more than 9000 interior ministry troops have been 
sent in and a curfew was imposed 
yastrebov said the deputies were asked whether they believe 
more decisive measures are needed to end the unrest but that a 
decision was postponed until friday he said he could not spell out 
what other measures the deputies could approve 
in earlier debate economist nikolai shmelev said premier nikolai 
i ryzhkovs call on wednesday for extensive defense cuts and 
government relief for almost 40 million soviets living in poverty 
will fall far short of solving the countrys woes 
shmelev said soviet farmers should be motivated to work harder by 
offering them pay in foreign currency with which they could buy 
hardtoget goods 
shmelev also called for a cut in aid to latin america quoting 
us estimates that the soviet union spends between 6 and 8 
billion on activities there especially in aid to cuba he said no 
one understands what a significant portion of that money is spent

rich and poor alike must be given the same opportunity and 
access to an adequate education the court ruled in a case brought 
four years ago by a coalition of 66 property poor districts

expensive but they were willing 
rose and blandford also said the ruling was something of a 
relief although they technically were on the losing side as far 
as im concerned there are no more sacred cows in education 
blandford said 
the kentucky lawsuit was one of several pending in state courts 
around the country one such suit is pending in texas and another 
in new jersey is scheduled for arguments in that states supreme 
court in september 
the kentucky court agreed with plaintiff districts that despite 
existing programs to funnel state money to local districts there 
are wide variations in financial resources which result in 
unequal educational opportunities throughout kentucky stephens 
opinion said 
even a total elimination of all mismanagement and waste in 
local school districts would not correct the situation as it now 
exists the opinion said 
the constitution places an absolute duty on the general 
assembly to recreate reestablish a new system of common 
schools the opinion said likening the present system to a 
crumbling schoolhouse which must be redesigned and revitalized for 
efficient use 
the legislature must provide for adequate funding of schools and 
can choose its own method the court said but if lawmakers decide 
to continue basing the system on property taxes they must ensure 
full valuation of property and uniformity of tax rates the court 
said 
kentucky law has always required full valuation of property 
local school boards which now number 177 have been allowed to set 
their own tax rates however and they varied widely 
spending per pupil in 198788 ranged from a high of 4094 in 
anchorage an affluent suburb of louisville to a low of 1986 in 
williamsburg a small appalachian town in southeastern kentucky 
according to figures from the state department of education 
kentucky ranks 39th nationwide in per pupil spending with state 
and local funds averaging 2574 the department said 
the court ordered the effective date of its ruling delayed until 
the end of the next legislative session which is to begin in 
january 
justice charles leibson one of two dissenting justices said 
local school districts have no legal authority to sue the 
legislature leibson also predicted mass confusion over the courts 
apparent invalidation of decades of education law

the federal judge who presided over the 
breakup of atampt will handle the irancontra case of former national 
security adviser john poindexter 
us district court judge harold greene was given the poindexter 
case in a twoparagraph order signed by chief judge aubrey robinson 
who has been handling pretrial proceedings involving poindexter 
robinson said in the order that he was handing the matter over to 
greene because the case will be protracted and complex 
robinson also is handling pretrial hearings in the irancontra 
case of richard secord who asked robinson in a court session 
thursday not to consolidate a dozen criminal charges against him 
contained in two separate indictments 
assigning the poindexter case to another judge is aimed at 
expeditious and efficient dispostion of the courts business 
said robinson 
robinson has said it would be impossible for him to handle trials 
involving both poindexter and secord 
poindexter is charged in the irancontra scandal with conspiracy 
theft wire fraud two counts of obstruction of congress and making 
false statements to two congressional committees 
greene 66 has been handling the antitrust case involving the 
american telephone amp telegraph co and its subsequent breakup since 
1978 the year robert f kennedy on combating racial discrimination 
robinson signed the twoparagraph order last friday assigning the 
case to greene due to a clerical oversight copies of the order 
werent made available to the public 
meanwhile robinson said at a hearing that he will rule friday 
whether to combine criminal charges that accuse secord of lying to 
congress to cover up personal profits in the irancontra affair with 
1988 allegations that secord slipped illegal gifts to oliver l 
north 
thomas green secords attorney argued against bringing the two 
sets of charges together he said one of nine counts brought in 
april obstruction of congress is incredibly broad and will 
result in a lengthy battle over the use of classified material 
prosecutors have said they plan to introduce no classified material 
if secord is tried on the consolidated charges 
secords lawyer urged robinson to try secord separately on the 
gratuities charges relating to north a step the lawyer said would 
enable a trial in the next month or so 
at a previous hearing nov 19 was mentioned by lawyers as a 
possible starting date for a trial on consolidated indictments 
involving secord 
secords lawyer said charges involving the alleged lies to 
congress dont relate to the counts involving illegal gratuities to 
north 
the judge said however that broad discretion is given to 
trial courts under federal rules allowing consolidation of 
separate indictments and that there doesnt need to be mechanical 
linkage 
the gratuities charges involve a 13800 home security system for 
north and a 200000 fund set aside for the education of his 
children 
north was convicted last month of accepting the security system 
from secord along with falsifying and destroying documents and 
aiding and abetting in an obstruction of congress he will be 
sentenced june 23 
north then a white house aide enlisted secord to run arms to 
the contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the rebels 
the government is pressing to join the two sets of charges and 
plans to abandon wideranging conspiracy and theft counts accusing 
secord of being involved in the diversion of iran armssales profits 
to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
identical conspiracy and theft charges against north were dropped 
because of national security concerns the government refused to 
declassify sensitive material that would have had to be presented in 
court in a trial of those charges

us ambassador james lilley promised thursday his 
embassy will get all americans who want to leave out of the chinese 
capital 
starting from june 3 we were running very high risks staying 
here he told a news conference at the airport weve been 
planning since june 3 to move people out 
we will be able to handle the americans leaving lilly said 
one way or another we can do it i can assure you 
chinese soldiers were ordered into beijings central tiananmen 
square on saturday to crush a studentled movement for increased 
democracy and an end to corruption the government says nearly 300 
people were killed but chinese and foreign diplomats say up to 
3000 died soldiers roamed the streets for days shooting at random 
some americans have complained that the us mission was 
unresponsive to the need for evacuation 
they were not very helpful said stephanie tom of sausalito 
calif a student at beijing teachers college who called the 
embassy for a ride to the airport they were very disorganized 
those people are so exasperatingly noncommittal 
she eventually got a ride in a van sent by the west german 
embassy 
i asked the embassy to come and get me but they wouldnt 
said terese james of liberty city texas who was teaching at 
beijing forestry university 
they said id have to get to the airport myself miss james

them in lilley said 
they went through barricades we got machinegunned in our 
apartments yesterday its a very dicey situation he said 
he said there were contingency plans to evacuate people from 
china through shanghai or canton if escape via beijing proved 
impossible 
were not comfortable lilley said security is not a 
finite thing weve taken an awful lot of moves to improve our 
security and the biggest one was putting those people on that plane 
and pulling them out of town 
lilley said that with the troops in town with the shooting 
going on with your apartments being raked surrounded its just 
not a wise thing to keep people here at this point 
chinese soldiers sprayed a diplomatic residential compound with 
bullets wednesday 
lilley noted that thursday was relatively quiet compared to the 
previous four days but said we arent hearing shots but can you 
tell me we wont hear them tonight

members of a special senate investigating 
committee told interior secretary manuel lujan on thursday to take 
aggressive action at his department to improve what they said were 
deficient programs for indians 
lujan said he would 
sen thomas daschle dsd said he was worried that 
shortcomings discovered by the special unit of the senate select 
committee on indian affairs would go uncorrected 
daschle told lujan whose department oversees nearly all federal 
programs for indians someone has to do something shake them 
up someone has to say it is no longer going to be like it was 
the special committee chaired by sen dennis deconcini dariz 
has asked president bush to appoint a staff member at the white 
house whose only responsiblity would be to make sure federal 
responsibilities to american indians are met 
lujan objected to that saying the responsibility belonged to the 
interior department and he saw no need for an outside coordinator 
deconcini responded by saying it might be easier to get action if 
someone at the white house were helping 
during investigative work covering most of a year and weeks of 
hearings spanning six months the committee has uncovered what 
members consider gross mismanagement in numerous federal agencies 
dealing with indian interests 
as an example deconcini reminded lujan that in just a few 
months investigators working for the committee exposed millions of 
dollars in thefts of indian oil which the federal bureau of land 
management was supposed to be protecting 
he asked lujan what he would do about it 
well do what sen daschle suggested well do some kicking 
around lujan said 
the committee hearings which began in january also have 
revealed evidence of 
corruption in contracting for federal projects on indian 
reservations 
child abuse in bureau of indian affairs schools 
organized crime involvement in legal indian gambling operations 
poor management at the indian health service 
failure by the government to protect land granted indians by 
treaty from encroachment by nonindians 
federal projects for nonindians that have depleted resources 
such as water on reservations 
corruption among some tribal leaders 
deconcini said the committee will have a report on its findings 
by september or october 
i have concluded that the secretary of interior and the 
interior department are not meeting the trust responsibility he 
said he praised lujan for being sensitive to the problem 
but you need to translate it into action he said 
the report we are going to issue is not going to be extremely 
complimentary it is going to single out areas where the trust 
responsibility was not met 
lujan said the department was already starting to make changes 
based on findings of the committee

floridas supreme court reversed the 
conviction of a death row inmate thursday and ordered his fourth 
trial in the murders of three adults and two children 
in a 43 ruling the court said douglas jackson deserved another 
trial because the prosecutor in his third trial improperly 
questioned him about his conviction in the first trial 
the first verdict was overturned because his defense attorney was 
taking medication for a head injury during the trial jacksons 
second trial ended in mistrial 
jackson was convicted in his latest trial of killing walter 
washington 25 his wife edna 21 larry finney 26 and terrence 
and reginald manuel in march 1981 their bodies were found in the 
charred hulk of an car on a remote stretch of road 
the three adults died of shotgun wounds terrence 4 and 
reginald 14 months mrs washingtons sons died of smoke 
inhalation 
the killings occurred after jacksons estranged wife karen 
quarreled with him and left home to live with the victims 
the prejudicial effect upon a jury of testimony that a 
defendant has been previously convicted of the crimes for which he 
is now on trial is so damaging that it cannot be said beyond a 
reasonable doubt that a jury would return a verdict of guilty absent 
the testimony the courts majority opinion said 
but justice stephen h grimes argued that the crossexamination 
remark was harmless error 
moreover there is every reason to believe that the jury was 
already aware that this was not jacksons first trial grimes said 
in his dissenting opinion

parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani on 
thursday denied reports of a power struggle after the death of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
rafsanjani also said the postkhomeini regime in iran will not 
help free western hostages held in lebanon unless the united states 
releases frozen iranian assets and helps locate four missing 
iranians 
rafsanjani also signaled his intention of playing a bigger 
political role telling foreign reporters during a news conference 
that he wants more executive power for the presidency 
rafsanjani 55 is the only candidate running in the aug 18 
presidential election 
he is considered a moderate who seeks to end the countrys 
international isolation and boost private enterprise in opposition 
to radical hardliners who favor a selfreliant fundamentalist iran 
rafsanjani who is also acting commander in chief of the armed 
forces dismissed reports that iran was plunged into turmoil by 
khomeinis death as nothing but shooting in the dark by people who 
know nothing about the internal situation in our country 
rafsanjani stressed that president ali khameneis appointment to 
succeed khomeini as supreme leader was permanent 
khomeini 86 died saturday of a heart attack 11 days after 
undergoing surgery for internal bleeding 
khamenei 49 was named his successor on sunday amid speculation 
he would serve as a caretaker leader until constitutional reforms 
ordered by khomeini are approved in a referendum to be held 
simultaneously with the presidential election 
khamenei considered a moderate and a rafsanjani ally has served 
as irans head of state since 1981 he is barred by the constitution 
from running for a third fouryear term 
rafsanjani said the constitutional reforms will reinforce the new 
presidents executive power at the expense of the prime minister 
that will prevent rival power centers from stalling the 
decisionmaking process which has often happened in the past 
rafsanjani claimed that western countries and not iran were 
responsible for the countrys isolation saying the west should 
give up its former spirit that iran is a satellite belonging to 
them 
he said the country will remain faithful to khomeinis policy of 
neither east nor west but added that relations with the soviet 
union had improved and that he plans to visit moscow shortly 
the soviet union was iraqs main arms supplier during the 8year 
war with iran which ended with a unsponsored ceasefire in august 
if the westerners change their policy and treat us as the 
soviet union did they will see the same position on our part 
rafsanjani said speaking farsi through an interpreter 
but he charged that the united states and western europe follow 
hostile policies toward iran the united states practically 
entered the war against us 
asked about an appeal by president bush for help in freeing 
american hostages in lebanon he said the united states must use its 
influence on the rightwing christian lebanese forces militia 
believed to have kidnapped four iranian government employees 
then you can expect us to do what we can for the release of the 
other hostages although we have no responsibility in lebanon 
there are 15 western hostages in lebanon including nine 
americans who are believed held by proiranian shiite moslem 
extremists 
the four iranians last seen at a lebanese forces checkpoint 
north of beirut in 1982 are believed to be dead 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii said the 
united states provided iran with information on iranians held by 
christian forces in lebanon in 1982 he reiterated the us position 
that iran should help bring about the immediate and safe release of 
the american hostages in lebanon 
rafsanjani also said iran could not help on the hostage issue 
while iranian assets are frozen in the united states 
the united states has acted like a pirate if the iranian 
assets are released as a sign of goodwill we in return will do 
whatever we can he added 
the united states broke relations with iran froze billions of 
dollars in iranian assets in american banks and impounded military 
equipment ordered by deposed shah mohammad reza pahlavi after 
radicals seized the us embassy and held 52 americans hostage in 
1979 
commenting on the break in relations with britain over the novel 
the satanic verses by british novelist salman rushdie 
rafsanjani said the issue had been created by the west 
you allowed the book to be published despite warnings he 
said 
rafsanjani said khomeinis feb 14 religious ruling condemning 
rushdie to death for blaspheming islam in the book was decreed by 
islamic law and could not be evaded

the cable tv industry thursday issued a study 
showing that cable companies having a financial interest in program 
services dont try to keep their viewers from watching networks that 
the operators dont own a share of 
nor does the study by benjamin klein an economics professor at 
the university of california los angeles show that such cable 
companies refuse to license their program services to competing 
deliverers such as microwave operators and backyard satellite dish 
owners 
kleins study disputed assertions that giant cable operators such 
as telecommunications inc tci and american television and 
communications corp atc use their size to discriminate against 
program networks they do not own 
he said that although these companies are more inclined to carry 
the program services in which they have a stake they also are more 
likely than other cable operators to carry programming in which they 
have no investment 
more importantly to cable tv viewers klein said cable 
operators willingness to invest in programming networks a practice 
known as vertical integration has led to an increased variety 
of programming choices not previously available to television 
consumers 
as this landmark report illustrates cables investment in 
programming has enabled our industry to offer consumers a new and 
better type of television national cable television association 
president james mooney said 
ncta released the report less than a week before a senate 
subcommittee was scheduled to begin hearings on increased 
concentration of media ownership 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio has proposed that no single 
company may own cable systems that reach more than 25 percent of the 
nations cable households similar to federal regulations on 
overtheair broadcasters 
klein studied 400 us cable systems of varying sizes and markets 
and found that vertically integrated multiplesystem operators are 
somewhat more likely to carry networks in which they have an 
ownership interest 
however he said this effect is generally small because the 
vertically integrated companies have ownership interests in 
relatively few networks compared to the 40 50 or even 120 channels 
they may carry

a black palm cockatoo a bird on the 
endangered species list was killed by a wild mink at a zoo where it 
was taken after being seized in an illegal bird shipment from asia 
the bird worth 10000 was one of three sent to mesker park zoo 
before a transfer to other zoos in about three weeks 
the cockatoos which were not in good health were sent to mesker 
because zoo director ron young is regional coordinator of the palm 
cockatoo consortium a group that monitors and establishes breeding 
programs at zoos 
only 3000 pairs of the birds are left in the wild young said 
young said the bird was killed sunday by a mink that entered the 
birds cage through a narrow slit 
weve seen the minks and besides when youve been working 
around a zoo as long as us here you know by how somethings been 
killed what did it young said the mink they kill for the fun 
of killing they are devious creatures theyre a killing machine

a vaccine developed by polio pioneer jonas salk 
may help wipe out the aids virus in people already infected and stop 
them from getting the deadly disease according to preliminary 
research presented thursday 
it is becoming clear that a diagnosis of hiv positivity need 
not be regarded as a death sentence salk said 
salks approach is one of several newly reported developments 
that experts say raises hopes that an aids vaccine is possible if 
still far away 
if the vaccine works as salk hopes it will stimulate the body to 
hunt down its own blood cells that carry hiv the aids virus such 
cells are virusmaking factories inside the body and wiping them 
out could hold the virus in check preventing it from spreading and 
causing aids 
whether the vaccine will actually work this way is still unclear 
although it has been tested in people the best evidence of its 
potential power comes from experiments on chimpanzees the only 
animal besides people that can be infected with the aids virus 
experts caution that much more work will be necessary in both 
animals and people before anyone knows whether the vaccine will save 
lives 
however dr dani p bolognesi of duke university a top us 
aids vaccine researcher said the new work is promising in part 
because it suggests that an effective vaccine can be made for 
treatment after aids infection something many experts had doubted 
this suggests it is possible to deal with the virus in 
alreadyinfected individuals he said 
while cautioning that this and other animal studies need to be 
confirmed he added they are the beginnings i believe of 
piercing the armor that has existed that it would be impossible to 
protect against this class of virus 
the latest vaccine studies were described at the weeklong 5th 
international conference on aids 
salks animal studies conducted with dr clarence gibbs of the 
us national institutes of health were performed on three chimps 
two of them had already been infected with hiv when they received 
the vaccine after three injections all measurable signs of the 
virus disappeared and when scientists gave them more virus they 
did not become reinfected 
the other chimp was given virus for the first time after 
vaccination while this animal got infected the level of virus in 
its body has been steadily dropping instead of rising as usually 
happens 
gibbs described these results as very startling and said 
we dont want to raise false hopes but these studies are 
increasing our understanding about what is necessary for a vaccine 
for hivinfected human beings 
salk said that creating an aids vaccine is much more difficult 
than a polio vaccine which he developed in the 1950s and while he 
would not predict when an aids vaccine might be available he 
commented there is light at the other end of the tunnel we hope 
to move in that direction as quickly as possible 
in human studies conducted with dr alexandra levine of the 
university of southern california the vaccine was given in november 
1987 to 19 people with preaids disease 
she said they have not progressed to aids and skin tests suggest 
the vaccine has stimulated their bodies to produce microbefighting 
blood cells against the virus however there is no clear evidence 
that the level of virus in their bodies has fallen 
the aids virus kills by attacking the bodys immune defenses 
salk said he hopes the vaccine will produce more dramatic results 
when given to infected people whose immune systems are still healthy 
salks vaccine is made from aids viruses that have been killed 
and stripped of their outer coats 
if this holds up in man it could be of substantial 
importance said dr robert gallo of the national cancer 
institute but he cautioned against giving killed viruses to 
uninfected people because live viruses might slip through 
other researchers are testing similar vaccines against siv an 
aidslike virus that kills monkeys 
researchers at the new england regional primate center reported 
that a killed vaccine kept two of five monkeys from becoming 
infected with siv 
another team from the biotechnology firm repligen said they had 
found the precise spot on the outside of the virus that stimulates 
the body to produce killing antibodies this small fragment might 
serve as an aids vaccine

the senate committee reviewing the 
controversial nomination of william lucas to head the justice 
departments civil rights division has asked him to provide some 
200000 pages of documents a justice department spokesman said 
thursday 
a committee source denied that that many documents were requested 
the spokesman david runkel declined to criticize the senate 
judiciary committee for last weeks demand by its staff saying only 
that the amount of paperwork requested was unusual 
it seems to me it would take years for the senate staff to 
review all this material he said 
however a committee source said we have not asked for 
something broad but for something pretty narrow but apparently 
the way the records are kept theyre in a much broader category 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said some 
documents may involve privacy matters and we dont even want to 
look at the stuff much less sort through it 
attorney general dick thornburgh questioned judiciary committee 
chairman joseph r biden jr ddel about the request wednesday 
night when thornburgh spoke to the delaware state bar association 
he said something like theyre asking for a lot of stuff 
runkel said 
thornburgh urged biden to schedule lucas confirmation hearings 
as soon as possible and the senator said he hoped they could be 
held before the july 4 holiday 
the committee source declined to reveal what kinds of documents 
the committee is seeking because we dont to be unfair to the 
nominee by raising unfair implications about what were looking at 
but runkel said the committee wanted such things as employment 
records and court documents on cases that may have been filed in 
which he as a public official may have been a defendant 
lucas who is working for the justice department as a 284aday 
consultant while awaiting senate confirmation seems somewhat 
amazed by the request for the documents runkel said 
the nominee did not respond to phone calls seeking comment 
lucas who had been in private legal practice in detroit for two 
years before being nominated for the assistant attorney generals 
post by president bush in april had served as sheriff and chief 
executive of wayne county mich which includes detroit 
a black republican who ran unsuccessfully for michigan governor 
in 1986 lucas had been a lifelong democrat before joining the gop 
in 1985 
lucas nomination is opposed by some civil rights groups on the 
grounds he lacks legal experience particularly in civil rights on 
his senate questionnaire lucas said he has never tried a case in 
court since he entered private legal practice in detroit two years 
ago 
in one notable case lucas was found legally responsible for 
injuries suffered by a prisoner who was beaten while in the custody 
of wayne county sheriffs deputies 
the 1976 beating of salvatore marchese by an unidentified person 
who was admitted to his locked holding cell was the subject of a 
strongly worded 1985 ruling by the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
the court cited lucas failure to provide a trained and 
disciplined county law enforcement agency or to investigate the 
beating incident 
lucas had testified that he did not know about the incident and 
therefore would not have been able to investigate it 
but the appellate court said he remained legally liable and that 
his failure to order and direct an investigation and to punish those 
responsible served to confirm the existence of an unstated 
policy of toleration of illegal brutality toward any county

interest rates on fixedrate mortgages dropped 
in early may after two straight monthly hikes but those on 
adjustablerate mortgages continued climbing for the seventh 
consecutive month the government reported thursday 
the federal home loan bank board said fixed rates fell 009 
percentage point to 1150 percent the april fixed rate of 1159 had 
been the highest since december 1985 when rates averaged 1201 
percent 
rates on adjustablerate mortgages rose 014 percentage point to 
1029 percent in early may the highest since december 1985 when 
rates averaged 1039 percent the bank board said 
the drop in the fixed rate reflected an easing of other longterm 
interest rates the bank board said interest rates overall began 
falling recently after being propped up by the federal reserve for 
15 months to stem inflation 
the increase in the arm rate was caused primarily by a decrease 
in the number of institutions offering firstyear belowmarket 
teaser rates on these types of loans according to james barth 
the bank boards chief economist 
barth said because of the higher rates for adjustablerate 
mortgages the arms portion of all loans closed declined to 53 
percent in early may down from 55 percent in the previous month and 
the smallest in a year 
last friday the federal home loan mortgage corp known as 
freddie mac reported fixedrate mortgages averaged 1048 percent 
last week down from 1050 percent a week earlier on oneyear 
adjustablerate mortgages lenders were asking an average initial 
rate of 921 percent up from 918 percent the week before 
the freddie mac figures are lower than those reported by the bank 
board because they do not include addon fees known as points 
often paid by borrowers

us trade representative carla hills 
responding to complaints about highhanded american negotiating 
tactics said thursday that the administrations decision to target 
trade barriers in japan brazil and india was not meant to be an 
exercise in mindless namecalling 
hills said she was optimistic that the administrations decision 
would result in successful negotiations despite howls of protest 
from the targeted countries 
the administration implementing the most controversial section 
of the 1988 trade law cited the three nations last month for 
serious fairtrade violations with the threat that they could face 
100 percent retaliatory tariffs if the countries do not agree to 
remove the offending barriers to us products 
the united states action was criticized at an international 
meeting last week in paris with the 24nation organization for 
economic cooperation and development attacking such unilateral trade 
actions 
hills who attended the paris meeting defended the 
administration against complaints from other countries that the 
united states was threatening to set off a global trade war of 
retaliation and counterretaliation 
in testimony thursday before the house ways and means 
subcommittee on trade hills said we do not seek mindless 
namecalling in implementing the trade law 
rather she said the administation hoped that it had laid out 
the priorities it would be working to achieve in opening markets 
over the next year 
hills received general praise from members of the trade 
subcommittee for her decision 
subcommittee chairman sam gibbons dfla said that the 
administration had managed to walk a fine line between sounding 
tough enough to say we mean business but also saying we are here 
to negotiate 
some congressmen questioned why the administration had chosen 
such a limited target list for japan the products covered by the 
negotiations will be supercomputers satellites and us lumber 
hills said the countries and items named represented a judgment 
call on the part of the administration of the areas which offered 
the best possibility of expanding markets for american products 
within the tight negotiating deadlines set by the trade provision 
called super 301 
countries not named to the priority list this year could still be 
named when the administration is required to present a new list next 
year hills said 
shortly after hills appearance a us shipbuilding industry 
group announced that it had filed a complaint challenging shipyard 
subsidies provided by the governments of west germany norway japan 
and south korea 
the petition filed by the shipbuilders council of america an 
industry trade group requested that hills begin negotiations to end 
the subsidies being provided by the four countries 
the shipbuilding group unveiled its demands during a capitol hill 
news conference attended by several senators and house members who 
represent cities with shipyards with many of them complaining about 
the closing of 55 shipyards since 1978 with a loss of 60000 jobs 
hills has 45 days to decide whether to accept the petition and 
begin negotiations with the countries to end the subsidies 
during her testimony hills announced that the united states and 
japan would begin talks next week on a broad range of japanese 
structural impediments to trade she said she hoped these 
initial discussions would lay the groundwork for talks aimed at 
removing various broadbased impediments to trade such as the 
japanese distribution system

a house subcommittee heard opposing views 
thursday on a bill to reduce regulation in the shipment of goods by 
sea between us ports one of the last heavily regulated forms of 
transportation 
the measure would primarily affect the shipment of goods to and 
from hawaii alaska puerto rico the virgin islands and other 
island territories 
it would put all such traffic under the federal maritime 
commission currently the interstate commerce commission regulates 
some shipments that start out on rail or truck 
in some cases shippers can choose which federal agency they want 
to have oversee their rates 
some island communities feel they are captive to those few 
carriers that serve their island while other domestic trade areas 
have vigorous competition that help restrain rates said rep 
walter b jones dnc chairman of the merchant marine 
subcommittee of the house committee on merchant marine and fisheries 
this bill deregulates a great deal said jones but 
frankly it retains the concept of economic regulations where the 
public interest demands a degree of oversight 
in the first of two scheduled hearings on the measure domestic 
ocean carriers varied in their reactions to the bill a hearing next 
week is to include federal regulators state representatives and 
shippers 
richard j knapp of alaska railroad corp opposed the bill 
saying regulation by the maritime commission would prohibit 
shipments by contracts which are allowed under icc regulations 
this bill would severely compromise competition in the 
interstate transportation marketplace and it would unduly restrict a 
carriers ability to tailor services to shipper requirements in a 
timely manner knapp said 
walter j anderson president of gulf puerto rican transport 
supported a provision in the bill that would prohibit the government 
of puerto rico from requiring its agencies to use vessels operated 
by the stateowned carrier even though its prices may be higher that 
other carriers 
hudson r warren of tropical shipping and construction co which 
operates 12 vessels serving the virgin islands and several caribbean 
countries said having two agencies regulate shipping has resulted 
in confusing and conflicting regulations 
he said some shippers have tried to avoid paying for services by 
filing complaints that their shipments should have been covered by a 
different federal agency

an aide to us defense secretary dick 
cheney said thursday the oneyear timeframe president bush set for 
an eastwest accord on cutting conventional forces and arms in 
europe was more a goal than a deadline 
west german gen wolfgang altenburg head of natos panel of 
allied commanders had questioned the timetable as cheney and his 
colleagues held their spring meeting at nato headquarters 
its a real challenge altenburg told reporters its 
optimistic indeed unrealistic i dont know if we make it in 
12 months i do not know 
at a nato summit in brussels last week the allies agreed to a 
proposal advanced by bush on specific cuts in troops and combat 
aircraft his new plan came in response to a flurry of recent arms 
control initiatives by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
bush wants accord reached within six to 12 months at eastwest 
talks in vienna to cut us and soviet troops in europe to 275000 
each and cut about 750 combat planes from nato forces and 3000 from 
the sevennation warsaw pact 
the president said that if washington withdraws 30000 troops 
from europe and moscow withdraws 325000 each side then would have 
275000 troops remaining 
cheney discussed the timetable with the defense ministers a 
cheney aide briefing reporters agreed it was ambitious to 
expect a conventional arms accord within a year 
but said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the united states put it up as a goal not a deadline 
he said success at the vienna talks hinged on soviet willingness 
to reach an accord its up to the soviets now 
the aide pointed to an improved eastwest disarmament climate and 
said we are moving already much faster than before 
the ministers will end their twoday meeting friday by 
reaffirming the goal for all north atlantic treaty organization 
nations to increase annual defense budgets by 3 percent after 
inflation 
the cheney aide said that although most members including the 
united states will not achieve that goal this year the defense 
chiefs agreed it would be unwise to drop 3 percent as an objective 
this week nato officials held their first talks on how to 
implement bushs aircraft proposal how and where to cut 750 combat 
aircraft from nato air forces and which aircraft should be scrapped 
east and west are already negotiating cuts in such armaments as 
tanks and artillery throughout europe at the vienna talks that began 
this year 
bush added troops and combat aircraft in response to a flurry of 
recent arms control initiatives by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
officials said the nato panel considering aircraft cuts will meet 
weekly until september to beat what altenburg termed the very 
severe time factor bush put on his proposals 
for instance how is this to be broken down among the different 
nations we have to consider the role each nation has 
us officials said there was general agreement among the 
ministers not to reduce british and french planes that can carry 
conventional or nuclear bombs 
also excluded they said must be the 72 us air force f16 jets 
nato will be moving from torrejon air base near madrid to a base in 
southern italy 
the move follows spains decision to end a basing accord with the 
united states 
the ministers reviewed on thursday their efforts to maintain an 
equitable sharing of natos defense costs an issue that has 
generated criticism in the us congress that many nato allies do 
not pull their weight in nato

president bush indicated thursday he plans a 
hardline approach on new cleanair standards that will 
significantly improve the quality of life of all north americans 
bush who will unveil his cleanair package monday met with 
industry leaders who said they pleaded against coming up with 
standards too tough to be affordable 
we urged him to make certain that when the dust settles on 
clean air that we have a healthy economy left said william d 
fay administrator of the clean air working group a business 
coalition 
well have to wait until monday to see whether or not the point 
got through fay said after he and other industry officials met 
with bush at the white house 
later at a session with environmental leaders bush indicated he 
was ready to move ahead with strong measures participants said 
he said that he agreed this is a freight train coming down the 
track said george frampton president of the wilderness society 
he felt that he strongly personally wanted to be out front on 
this 
ruth caplan executive director of environmental action said 
we are calling on him to again do a nato it is time for him to 
exercise leadership and call for strong measures to protect the 
health of the american people she was referring to bushs 
dramatic call last month for unilateral troop cuts in europe 
she said bush was given information on air quality in 
kennebunkport maine where he has a vacation home he was shocked 
to know that last summer there were many days in which there were 
serious health problems from ozone smog she said 
white house aides as well as participants at both the industry 
and environmental meetings insisted bush has not made up his mind 
on many aspects of the package the first major overhaul of the 1970 
clean air act in 12 years 
administration aides speaking on the condition of anonymity 
said however that bush had already decided on many key parts of 
the legislation including tough new standards for cleaning up 
smokestack emissions that cause acid rain changes that would prove 
costly to industry 
the president has also decided on rigid new standards to prevent 
chemical contamination of the air 
these standards will be farreaching extending to hundreds of 
categories of businesses ranging from paint factories to bakeries 
the sources said 
such suggestions prompted praise from congressional democrats 
even before bush submitted his proposal he has wholly reversed 
the position of the reagan administration on this subject said 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine 
speaking to a hunters conservation group bush reinforced the 
contention that his proposals would prove costly to industry and be 
wideranging 
for too long weve focused on cleanup and penalties after the 
damage is already done its time to reorient ourselves using 
technologies and processes that reduce or prevent pollution to 
stop it before it starts in the 1990s pollution prevention will go 
right to the sources bush said 
power plants and other industries that burn coal in the midwest 
many of which disperse their pollutants through tall smokestacks 
without technological controls will be a key target of bushs 
cleanair attack the sources said 
these emissions have been cited as a major cause in the acidrain 
pollution that afflicts lakes and wildlife in canada and the 
northeastern united states 
in his remarks to ducks unlimited a conservation group of 
waterfowl hunters that seeks to protect and preserve wetlands bush 
declared i will unveil the most sweeping changes to the clean air 
act since it was last amended 12 years ago 
it will allow us to recover and restore precious forests lakes 
and streams and whether americans live near factories in cities 
or in high woodland country it will significantly improve every 
north americans quality of life 
roger b smith chairman of general motors said the industry 
leaders who met with bush asked the president for a flexible 
solution that would be cost effective and he said he hadnt made up 
his mind on a lot of factors yet 
he didnt make any commitments on anything we need to have a 
bill thats on an economically sound basis he said 
smith voiced some skepticism toward one feature that bush has 
said will be in the legislation a program to encourage alternate 
motor fuels such as alcohol blends 
we need more studies on alternate fuels smith said he said 
that car engines that can accept alcohol blends use greater volumes 
of fuel than gasolineonly engines suggesting either larger fuel 
tanks in vehicles or the building of more service stations 
richard lesher president of the us chamber of commerce said 
bush left little doubt that he will submit a tough bill 
we hope this bill will reflect flexibility he said it 
will be a strong bill but this is a starting point rather than an 
ending point 
lesher said that much would happen to the bill when it gets to 
congress where rival cleanair measures are already advancing 
through both chambers

the armed forces can save money if they rely on 
advertising to obtain recruits instead of more recruiters or cash 
bonuses according to studies released thursday 
and at least in the case of the army they said the advertising 
should be placed in national magazines and local newspapers first 
with television the next priority and local radio last 
the report on military advertising was issued by the rand corp 
a pentagonsupported think tank based in santa monica calif it was 
asked to study the issue by the defense departments manpower office 
rand issued two studies one focusing on army advertising efforts 
and the other assessing whether the services should do their own ads 
or whether joint ads with the other armed forces work as well 
the studies focusing on military advertising campaigns from 1981 
to 1984 were done by researchers james n dertouzos and j michael 
polich 
the research dealing with the army found advertising does make a 
difference in an era of the allvolunteer military and cuts in the 
ad budget will hurt 
the empirical results show that in general advertising 
expenditures in a given month have a significant and immediate 
effect on the number of highquality enlistments in the army the 
study said 
we estimated the marginal cost of recruiting a highquality 
person through increased advertising to be between 5000 and 
6000 the marginal cost of achieving the same goal by increasing 
the recruiting staff was about 5700 and the cost of using cash 
bonuses was much higher about 16000 per recruit 
there also appear to be significant differences among the media 
in their cost effectiveness at least for the army the study 
continued 
national magazine and local newspaper advertising are the most 
cost effective in promoting shortrun enlistment responses costing 
2000 and 3400 per additional recruit national broadcasting 
purchases also have strong effects but appear to cost somewhat 
more than the print media 7000 to 10000 per marginal recruit 
at the other extreme local radio has no detectable effect on 
shortrun enlistments 
in 1984 the study said the army spent 45 million on recruiting 
ads and used twothirds of that money for tv spots 
as for the issue of individual service advertisements as 
opposed to joint ads the second study concluded both types 
appear to be very powerful tools and in general can produce a 
new recruit for roughly the same outlay of cash 
the army and navy however do appear to benefit the most from 
joint ads while the air force and marine corps seem to do the best 
with individual ads 
but in general the gains of any one branch do not seem to 
come at the expense in terms of lost recruits of any othr the 
study said 
each branch gained recruits from the civilian population rather 
than at the others expense

thousands of ethnic rioters attacked government 
offices and a police station in uzbekistan in a bloody bid to seize 
firearms raising the death toll in a fiveday rampage to at least 
71 official media said thursday 
corpses are being found in gutted houses and the wounded are 
dying in hospitals uzbek premier gairat kadyrov told the 
government newspaper izvestia 
at least 71 people were killed and the figure was likely to 
continue climbing he said 
the violence began june 3 with fighting between ethnic uzbeks and 
the meskhi turk minority forcibly resettled in the fergana valley 
of uzbekistan by stalin in 1944 
officials have not been able to contain it despite evacuating 
more than 10000 of the meskhi minority and sending in 9000 
interior ministry soldiers 
communist party officials asked the congress of peoples deputies 
parliament thursday to approve more decisive measures to stabilize 
the situation in uzbekistan deputy alexei yastrebov said in a 
telephone interview he represents the ural mountains region of 
russia 
yastrebov said he could not specify measures under consideration 
he said a group of deputies including some from uzbekistan were 
told to investigate the latest developments and report back to the 
congress on friday before a decision is taken 
west german sources said in bonn on thursday that soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev has cut the agenda for his fourday 
west german visit next week to stay in touch with the kremlin over 
events in his troubled nation 
they cited the unrest in uzbekistan as one factor 
the bloodshed in eastern uzbekistan was the latest in a series of 
violent clashes that have embroiled the southern rim of the soviet 
union for more than a year 
scores of people have been killed in the caucasus republics of 
georgia armenia and azerbaijan but the violence has spread 
recently to turkmenia and uzbekistan in central asia 
the tass news agency said the latest spark was wednesday in 
kokand when thousands of people excited by alcohol drugs and 
calls for violence stormed the city police department to seize 
firearms 
at the same time a crowd of 500 to 600 attacked a local interior 
ministry transportation office it said 
the attacks failed but a preliminary count indicated six people 
were killed more than 90 including soldiers were injured 
sixtyfive houses and six offices were burned down it said 
more houses are burning tass added 
tass said the soldiers were given orders to shoot to protect 
themselves but so far had avoided opening fire 
the crowds of attackers have been dispersed and most active 
rioters have been detained it said 
official radio moscow said more than 600 people have been hurt 
and more than 400 suspects in the ethnic violence have been arrested 
the official radio said that shooting and arson attempts 
continued wednesday night in the regional center of fergana with a 
population of more than 200000 more than 400 houses most of them 
belonging to meskhi turks had been burned down 
the official reports did not specify which ethnic group was 
responsible for the attacks in kokand but it was likely uzbeks 
because the meskhis have been the victims of most of the violence 
and many of them already have been evacuated 
uzbek sources said the violence which started with a dispute 
over the price of strawberries in a bazaar erupted because of 
smoldering resentment among uzbeks over what they see as 
preferential treatment of the minority 
the dispute led to a wave of pogroms arson beatings and 
murder accompanied by harassment and rape in conjunction with 
insolent marauding resistance to police and internal security 
forces kadyrov said 
passions are still boiling izvestia added 
the uzbek grassroots movement berlik called on the congress to 
remedy living conditions which it said was an underlying cause of 
the bloodshed 
the activists claim cotton production quotas imposed by moscow 
has forced uzbekistan to neglect food crops meanwhile the campaign 
to boost cotton production has forced farms to poison the 
enviromment with vast quantities of chemical fertilizers and 
pesticides they say

pakistan prime minister benazir bhutto on 
thursday urged nations with strong democratic traditions to help 
reinforce fledging democracies like her own by forming an 
association of democratic nations 
democracy needs support and the best support for democracy 
comes from other democracies democratic nations should come 
together in an association designed to help each other and promote 
what is a universal value democracy ms bhutto said in her 
keynote address at 338th commencement exercises at harvard 
university her alma mater 
ms bhutto said the association could help bolster freedom by 
sending observers to monitor elections in countries struggling to 
maintain democracy 
it is much harder to steal an election if the whole world is 
watching ms bhutto told an estimated crowd of 25000 
an association of democracies could also mobilize world opinion 
against leaders of any coup and take such steps as economic 
sanctions while using foreign aid as a reward for democracy she 
said 
there is nothing wrong with rewarding an idea in which the 
donors believe the prospects for democracy may depend upon it 
she said 
ms bhutto added a plea for understanding muslim countries 
saying many outsiders mistakenly believe democracy cant survive in 
a country like pakistan 
but i stand before you a muslim woman the elected prime 
minister of one hundred million muslims a living refutation of such 
arguments she said 
the 35yearold prime minister the first woman in modern times 
to lead a moslem country is a 1973 graduate of radcliffe 
when asked at a brief news conference later to comment on recent 
events in china ms bhutto said pakistan and china have a very 
old association and friendship and it was through pakistan that the 
united states restored its links with china 
we regret the loss of human lives and would like to see a 
return to the restraint that was initially taken she continued 
many who have friendships with china have been very disturbed with 
what has been going on there 
ms bhutto who also holds a degree from oxford university 
picked up the populist political mantle of her father deposed and 
executed prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto 
the elder bhutto was overthrown in 1977 by gen mohammed zia 
ulhaq and executed by hanging two years later in the ensuing 
years benazir oldest of bhuttos four children and the one he 
tapped as his political successor spent seven years in arrest and 
detention she went into selfimposed exile in 1984 and from england 
she became leaderinexile of the pakistan peoples party 
in 1986 she returned home three months after zia was killed in a 
plane crash ms bhutto claimed victory in the first democratic 
election in her country in 11 years 
since her arrival in the united states on monday ms bhutto has 
met privately with president bush and other government officials and 
addressed congress she planned to visit the united nations on 
friday before departing the next day for pakistan

prime minister margaret thatcher on thursday 
rejected a request by hong kongs governor to grant 325 million 
chinese residents in the territory the right to emigrate to britain 
hong kong is due to be handed over to china in 1997 and fears 
that china will not honor an agreement to preserve the colonys 
capitalist system for 50 years increased after the violent crackdown 
on prodemocracy demonstrations in beijing 
in a 90minute emergency meeting governor sir david wilson said 
he told mrs thatcher that granting the right of entry to chinese 
carrying british passports would do an immense amount of good in 
hong kong 
wilson speaking to reporters outside mrs thatchers 10 downing 
street residence said mrs thatcher replied that would be a 
matter of grave political difficulty while reiterating promises 
to be more flexible 
thousands of hong kong chinese usually the better off and best 
educated have already emigrated mainly to canada australia and 
the united states

senators advocating disability benefits for 
vietnam veterans suffering from cancer they believe caused by agent 
orange said thursday they were confident of finally winning 
congressional passage after repeated setbacks 
sen john f kerry dmass said the compromise bill would 
provide interim disability benefits to veterans who were exposed to 
the chemical defoliant during the vietnam war and now suffer from 
either nonhodgkins lymphoma or softtissue sarcoma 
under the bill disability benefits would extend only through 
1993 survivors benefits for spouses would go through midapril 
1992 congress which by then would have received a new study by the 
centers for disease control would have to vote to continue the 
benefits 
the measure is needed not only to help veterans with their 
medical difficulties but it is also important as a statement that 
we intend to make good on our promises to help those who fought in 
the war said kerry a former navy lieutenant who piloted a patrol 
boat in the mekong delta 
too many veterans remember what it was like to fight the vc 
viet cong they didnt have to come back here to fight the va 
veterans administration the name still used for the veterans 
department the senator said 
separate agent orange bills sponsored by kerry and sen thomas 
daschle dsd failed in 1987 and again last year the reagan 
administration steadfastly opposed the proposals saying more 
scientific evidence was needed to link the chemical defoliant used 
by us forces in southeast asia to the cancers in the light of 
several studies that failed to find such a link 
but kerry and daschle at a news conference introducing the 
legislation said positive signs from both the new administration 
and capitol hill account for their optimism 
the senators said they were encouraged by veterans affairs 
secretary ed derwinski and his decision last month not to appeal a 
federal appeals courts decision striking down regulations to 
restrict compensation for agent orange victims 
derwinski also ordered reviews of the cases of all vietnam 
veterans whose agent orange claims were denied daschle praised 
derwinski as the most sympathetic head of the veterans 
administration since the vietnam war 
the bills prospects improved when sen alan cranston dcalif 
chairman of the senate veterans affairs backed it late last year 
after various changes to narrow its scope 
the measure would cost an estimated 19 million annually in 
benefits senate aides said

el salvadors air force improperly sold 
100000 worth of fuel provided by the united states to air crews 
resupplying the nicaraguan contras in an effort set up by oliver 
north the general accounting office told congress thursday 
assistant comptroller general frank c conahan testified that the 
transfer of the fuel violated agreements between the united states 
and el salvador stipulating that title or possession of 
ussupplied defense items or services cannot be transferred 
without prior us government consent 
conahan said pilots under contract to the contra resupply 
operation run by former air force maj gen richard v secord bought 
fuel on at least 63 occasions in 1986 from tanks on the military 
side of ilopango air base he said ussupplied fuel was provided 
on 32 of those occasions 
conahan testified on behalf of the gao an investigatory arm of 
congress before the senate appropriations foreign operations 
subcommittee 
felix rodriquez a private individual supporting the contra 
effort had at the request of national security council official 
oliver north set up an operations center at the ilopango base to 
use air drops inside nicaragua to resuply the contras 
conahan said that from april to september 1986 the salvadoran air 
force old 61107 gallons of the usprovided fuel to the contra 
resupply enterprise 
we found no evidence that the salvadoran government requested 
or obtained us consent for the salvadoran air force to transfer 
military aid program funded fuel to the contra supply operation 
conahan said 
nor he said was evidence found that any us personnel knew of 
the sales 
but he said a substantial violation of the 1986 sales 
agreement with el salvador may have occurred because the transfers 
took place at a time when the united states was barred by law from 
using aid funds to support military or paramilitary operations of 
the contras 
conahan said it was also learned that the salvadoran air force 
sold nearly a million gallons of aviation fuel worth some 580000 
to us military and contract aircraft delivering nonlethal aid to 
the contras 
he said the gao accepted as reasonable the explanation that 
those transfers were not improper because the us government 
provided the fuel in the first place and because it was transferred 
to us entities 
but sen patrick j leahy dvt chairman of the foreign 
operations subcommittee said it would seem unique that the 
united states put itself in the position of first giving away the 
fuel then paying for it 
you could well say we were paying for it twice he said 
sen tom harkin diowa who initiated the investigation said 
the gao had uncovered the first documented case of a transfer of 
us foreign aid dollars to the contra resupply network 
additionally he said when sales to other thirdparty 
aircraft are taken into account the salvadoran air force received 
800000 in cash for fuel it received free under the us foreign 
aid program 
michael kozak acting assistant secretary for state for 
interamerican affairs acknowleged that the sales and transfers did 
take place 
but he said the department does not believe the violation to be 
substantial given the fact that the united states gave el 
salvador 230 million worth of aviation fuel in 1986 and 1987 
furthermore it does not appear that the transferred fuel 
sustained the nicaraguan resistance resupply operations over an 
extended period of time nor does it appear that this was support 
that the resistance could not have purchased from any commercial 
facility he said 
kozak said a lack of understanding on the part of ground 
personnel at ilopango as to which fuel required us permission 
before it could be transferred seems to have been the main if not 
the most important factor in this unauthorized diversion 
h diehl mckalip operations director of the defense security 
assistance agency said that because of a concern that assistance 
funds might have been or might be converted into unrestricted 
cash regulations have been issued to assure that any future funds 
generated from fuel transfers be deposited in a special holding 
account 
prior to the change he said 801519 was paid directly to the 
salvadoran air force since the change 973543 has been credited 
to the holding account mckalip said

pope john paul ii on thursday met the 
widow of slain prime minister olof palme who established relations 
with the vatican seven years ago 
lisbet palme met for 15 minutes with the pope who spoke with 
warmth about olof palmes visits to the vatican before he was 
gunned down in stockholm in 1986 said prime minister ingvar 
carlsson who was at the meeting 
carlsson said the pontiff had asked to see mrs palme who is due 
to testify next week against in the murder trial of christer 
pettersson which began on monday pettersson was arrested last 
december 
sweden an overwhelmingly lutheran country established 
diplomatic relations with the holy see in 1982 largely because of 
palmes admiration for john pauls concern for social issues palme 
visited the vatican twice 
mrs palme spoke with the pope about her work as head of the 
swedish chapter of unicef the un organization for children 
carlsson said 
carlsson met separately with john paul on political issues 
focusing on eastern europe and the elections in the pontiffs native 
poland 
sweden was the final leg on a fivenation tour of scandinavia 
where the john paul has been extolling the virtues of traditional 
religious teachings in an area with liberal views on sex marriage 
and birth control 
in one of his strongest homilies on the subject during his 10day 
pilgrimage the pope told a mass of 16000 people that the future 
of humanity comes by way of the family 
it is not alway easy today for married couples to live in a 
lifelong covenant marked by mutual fidelity respect and love he 
said 
swedens liberal attitudes prompted reporters to ask a senior 
vatican official australian archbishop edward cassidy why the pope 
would come to a country that permits abortion and accepts 
homosexuality and where the divorce rate is high among the 50 
percent of couples who bother to marry 
its a conflict of what one considers the common good said 
the vaticans undersecretary of state the pope either preaches 
the gospel or he doesnt preach 
many of swedens 135000 catholics are immigrants from more than 
50 countries and the pope could see colorful costumes of a dozen 
nationalities as he gazed from the podium of the spherical globe 
sports stadium 
pray for chinese students read one banner waving from the 
crowd 
in a remark directed at the immigrants and at some swedes who are 
reluctant to accept them john paul urged them to practice full 
participation in the social political and cultural life of sweden 
not only nativeborn swedes but also immigrants need to take 
their proper place in society so that they too can make a positive 
contribution to the country to which they now belong he said

the department of housing and urban development 
will reopen a probe into an alleged scheme to rig the awarding of 
federally subsidized housing in island park ny hud secretary 
jack kemp announced thursday 
i have asked the inspector general to reopen his investigation 
into the situation surrounding geraldine mcgann and the allocation 
of federally subsidized housing in the village of island park 
ny kemp said in a news release 
mrs mcgann huds region ii adminstrator is at the center of 
the controversy her son daniel mcgann was among those chosen to 
purchase a 44500 house in the program mrs mcgann is a village 
board member and last year was appointed huds region ii 
administrator 
a cousin of republican sen alfonse damato a longtime resident 
of island park also benefitted from the program by buying a home 
for 40000 according to a hud audit 
mrs mcgann asked for and was granted an administrative leave 
kemp said thursday she will continue to collect her 68500 annual 
salary according to hud spokesman robert e nipp 
mrs mcgann could not be reached for comment thursday a woman 
answering the phone in her office said mrs mcgann would not be at 
work 
the new investigation was triggered by a report in the new york 
times that officials in island park a predominantly white long 
island village had distributed federally subsidized homes to 
politically connected people and excluded blacks between 1980 and 
1984 the times based its story on a 1984 hud audit of the program 
kemp also announced highlevel hud employees will no longer be 
allowed to serve on state or local government boards agencies or 
panels and no hud employee at any level may serve on any such body 
that does business with the department 
in addition kemp said in the statement that hud discretionary 
funds will be targeted at ending homelessness enforcing fair 
housing and creating enterprise zones for example 
the times report noted that damato had persuaded former housing 
secretary samuel piece to earmark 425000 from the fund for a 
swimming pool in the oceanfront community the pool has not been 
built because the project has been tied up in local politics 
damatos cousin anthony ciccimarro paid 40000 for one of the 
subsidized houses according to the 1984 audit 
on thursday damato denied any involvement and termed the 
program excellent 
i know of no abuse and i know of no preferential treatment 
damato told a news conference i wrote no applications nor made 
any applications on peoples behalf had they asked me i would 
have i thought the program was a good program 
under the hud program island park which has a population of 
4200 and is 97 percent white received enough money to build 44 
homes to be sold at 40000 to 64000 each hud proposed that 17 of 
the 22 houses to be built during the projects second phase be sold 
to blacks from nearby areas but none were 
the hud houses were supposed to be advertised in local newspapers 
to reach lowerincome buyers especially minorities but some 
residents were tipped off and by the time the ads appeared 22 
buyers had been selected the times said 
damato said he did not believe there were tips or that no houses 
were purchased by members of minority groups 
he blamed the times story on a disgruntled former employee 
harry scully who was island parks village clerk at the time 
its obvious that the former village clerk harry scully has 
changed his story in order to attack his former associates on the 
village board for whatever reasons and that saddens me damato 
said 
scully told the times that he misled hud officials probing the 
program in 1984 he said mrs mcgann had called him to inquire about 
a hud house for her son and also said he had covered up for her 
scully did not immediately return a message left on his answering 
machine 
damato said the story was based primarily on a 5yearold 
preliminary audit 
ive been given to believe that the inspector generals final 
report did not concur with that 5yearold preliminary audit and 
found no evidence of wrongdoing he said 
hud inspector general paul adams said he did not know what final 
report damato was referring to

taxi drivers in this atlanta suburb are 
more wary about who they pick up and some have stopped driving at 
night since the slayings of four cabbies have sparked fears of a 
serial killer 
three of the four drivers shot to death since april 1 worked for 
the day amp night cab co including 30yearold steve trammell who 
was buried wednesday some night shift drivers have stayed home this 
week because they are afraid said company manager willard r dunson 
theyll be back he said they just wanted to take a few 
days off to think about things 
one cabbie who is still driving donald simmons said he is more 
careful about who rides in his taxi but he added that the job has 
always had an element of danger 
it is a very dangerous profession said joseph hall director 
of the atlanta bureau of taxicabs and vehicles for hire youre 
picking up a complete stranger youre taking him wherever he wants 
to go and hes behind you youre at a disadvantage 
russell oneal a day amp night driver who said he was trammells 
best friend said he now refuses any customer who doesnt come out 
of the residence to which he has been summoned 
trammells body was found sunday in a creek about 250 yards from 
his cab which still had its lights on and engine running police 
said he was beaten and shot twice apparently after being forced out 
of his taxi 
the other three were slain in similar fashion their bodies found 
in the nearby suburb of east point college park and inside atlanta 
city limits near college park 
college park police detective robert jacks said authorities 
havent established for certain that one person is behind the 
crimes but he said they havent ruled out that possibility either 
contrary to what people think we dont really know if weve 
got a serial killer jacks said it could be a coincidence 
there are a whole lot of loose ends in this case 
atlanta police detective cr price agreed but added that the 
serial killer theory is viable 
we have reason to believe that because they the slayings all 
occurred among cabbies working the south side he said 
jacks said no physical evidence has been found so far to link the 
killings except that all the victims were cabbies all worked in 
the same area and robbery did not appear to be the sole motive 
some of the victims still had money on them but of course you 
dont know how much they had to begin with jacks said theres 
not enough evidence to say they were all robberies 
the georgia bureau of investigation was brought into the case 
this week to lend its expertise and crime laboratory to the three 
police departments working on the killings said spokesman john 
bankhead 
jacks said trammells taxi was being examined at the lab this 
week for possible clues such as hair and other fibers 
hall said 16 cab drivers in the city have died violently since 
1980 that includes one of the four recent victims the others were 
found just outside the city limits

appointment thursday with the editor of a dissident soviet journal 
into a onehour 10minute discussion of ethnic violence in the 
soviet union a spokesman said 
sergei grigoryants editor of the unofficial magazine 
glasnost later told a news conference that he had discussed with 
quayle the killing of 22 soviet georgians in the city of tbilisi on 
april 9 
grigoryants said he believed the killings had been orchestrated 
by the kremlin to provide a pretext for cracking down on democratic 
movements in the soviet union especially those in the nonrussian 
republics 
the killings however provoked an outcry in the soviet 
parliament and there has been no nationwide crackdown grigoryants 
version of events differed sharply from official accounts a 
commission of the soviet parliament is investigating the tbilisi 
incident 
grigoryants who has been in and out of jail since soviet 
communist party general secretary mikhail s gorbachev rose to power 
in march 1985 called the soviet leader a hell of a criminal 
a spokesman for quayle said the vice president really enjoyed 
taking to this guy 
he found him a fascinating and courageous man said david 
beckwith the spokesman declined to offer a judgment on grigoryants 
views but said that extending the meeting by 50 minutes was unusual 
and it disrupted the vice presidents afternoon schedule

protect beijing either was replacing the 27th or already had done 
so

archbishop desmond tutu won a seat 
thursday on a harvard university governing board striking a blow 
for forces opposed to the schools 1638 million investment in 
companies doing business in south africa 
i pray god i will do justice to the honor that has been 
given me tutu said speaking from south africa 
the 1984 nobel prizewinner who promised a year ago to return 
honorary degrees to any schools that had not divested such holdings 
by may 1989 said he would not return the diploma harvard conferred 
on him 10 years ago 
instead the south african anglican prelate will use his new spot 
on the board of overseers to lobby against apartheid and for 
divestment said tutu spokesman john allen 
this is really big news said robert wolff director of 
harvardradcliffe alumni against apartheid i feel very confident 
that once tutu arrives there will be enormous pressure on harvard 
to divest 
tutus victory was the only one claimed by the prodivestment 
coalition which ran four other candidates against an official slate 
of 10 people backed by the harvard alumni association 
actor john lithgow and us labor secretary elizabeth dole both 
endorsed by the alumni assocation were the top votegetters in the 
writein election open to all harvard degree holders 
tutu came in fourth with 14226 of the votes cast by 39897 
people who elected five officials to serve sixyear terms on the 
30member board the panel monitors the universitys academic 
policies and advises the harvard corporation which manages the 
schools business affairs 
since 1986 the harvardradcliffe antiapartheid group has 
nominated candidates to the 30member overseers panel by petition 
and has succeeded in placing three members on the board 
the campaign was more heated than any in recent years with the 
alumni association and university officials speaking out against 
electing single issue candidates 
but wolff a professor of philosophy at the university of 
massachusetts at amherst said he was optimistic tutus presence on 
the panel would encourage other progressive board members to 
join the push for divestment in south africa 
there are a large number of progressive board members who would 
feel comfortable rallying to tutus standard wolff said in his 
presence he will be the moral center of the board on this issue 
wolff said it was not immediately clear when tutu would come to 
cambridge to meet with the board but predicted that when he 
comes thousands of people will turn out support him

an aides suggestion to minnesota sen rudy 
boschwitz has prompted a proposal for a pilot program that could 
lead congress to recycle the 20000 tons of garbage and trash 
generated by capitol buildings every year 
boschwitz asked the senate rules committee to consider a 
recycling program for the entire capitol complex which includes the 
supreme court library of congress and six congressional office 
buildings 
as a result of the request from boschwitz and house members the 
office of the architect of the capitol recently proposed to begin 
recycling garbage from two congressional office buildings as a pilot 
project 
if we dont set the example certainly it wont be set 
elsewhere boschwitz said thursday during a news conference by the 
newly formed greenhouse crisis foundation 
the foundation is dedicated to halt a global warming trend known 
as the greenhouse effect one of the groups goals is to slow 
the cutting of forests 
the republican senator who made a fortune in the plywood 
business became interested in recycling congressional garbage at 
the suggestion of linda garczynski a temporary staff member on loan 
to his office from the environmental protection agency that it 
might save money said boschwitz press secretary tim droogsma 
the capitol architects office has suggested the government begin 
recycling garbage from the russell senate office building and the 
rayburn house office building which together house about 5000 
workers said raymond carroll director of engineering 
it will be interesting to see if people will cooperate he said 
recycling programs require people to segregate items that can be 
recycled such as aluminum cans and paper from items that cannot 
such as certain plastics or food waste 
the pilot project would cost about 50000 mostly to purchase 
extra containers 
the project will need the approval of the house and senate 
committees that requested the study

the advertisersupported channel one news service 
for teens will be offered to schools nationwide starting in march 
1990 packaged with two new educational networks the creator of the 
service said thursday 
christopher whittle chairman of whittle communications said his 
company expects to spend 200 million on startup costs involved in 
giving 8000 or more schools the video equipment needed to receive 
channel one programming 
he plans to pay for it with 85 million to 100 million each year 
from advertisers who pay to pitch products on channel ones daily 
news show 
critics ncluding national educational groups argue that 
advertisers should not be allowed to pitch their wares to youngsters 
in the classroom 
we have listened to our critics whittle told a news 
conference in announcing the national launch of channel one but he 
said their main complaint about advertising was unaddressable 
he said if schools are going to get both a daily news show and 
the equipment to show it you have to pay for it and that 
advertising is the most feasible way because the federal governmment 
and corporate philanthropy have not provided the money 
nonetheless whittle said he has modified the channel one 
service that was tested for five weeks this past spring at six 
schools across the country and featured ads for jeans shampoo 
chewing gum candy bars and acne medicine 
whittle said schools signing up for channel one can have some 
rather than all of their classrooms wired to receive the program and 
need not show it to the whole school 
however he said schools that participate still will be obliged 
to show the program every day in those classrooms that have the 
channel one equipment 
in addition to channel one whittle will donate five hours of 
satellite time every school day for a channel called the classroom 
channel that would carry noncommercial educational programming 
the classroom channel would be run by a board independent of 
whittle communcations 
whittle said it was likely the board would decide against 
allowing advertising on that service schools could pick and choose 
what they want to use from that channel he said 
he said whittle communications would donate 500000 a year for 
the board to acquire rights to programming for the classroom 
channel the programs would include public broadcasting 
documentaries and instructional shows such as an advanced algebra 
class or language lesson 
whittle said he also was developing a third network the 
educators channel to carry programming for educators such as 
briefings by national education groups 
schools participating in channel one would be given equipment to 
receive all three channels in exchange for running the channel one 
program every day 
peggy charren who heads a national childrens advocacy group 
said she was unswayed by whittles modifications 
its the same deal with better packaging she said 
gary marx of the american association of school administratrors 
said it still turns the classroom into a marketplace for products 
rather than a marketplace for ideas 
whittle hopes to make channel one available in 1000 middle and 
high schools in march 1990 and add schools at a rate of 500 or more 
a month giving each school video equipment worth 40000 to 50000 
competition has sprung up since whittle tested channel one 
turner broadcasting systems cable news network plans to begin a 
daily adfree news program for schools starting in august while the 
discovery channel cable network says it intends to make 
commercialfree documentary programming 
cspan the cablesatellite public affairs network that provides 
coverage of congressional proceedings has been providing 
programming for use in the classroom since 1986 and said 3400 
teachers already use it cspan is expanding that service starting 
in late august 
but no cable network is donating equipment to the schools on the 
scale whittle has envisioned 
whittle released survey results wednesday indicating students who 
watched channel one were better informed about daily events than 
their counterparts who did not watch it the surveys also claim a 
majority of teachers students and administrators find the 
commercials an acceptable price to pay for the program

an appeals court reserved its decision thursday 
on whether the san diego yacht club broke competition rules or 
simply oneupped a new zealand group when it successfully defended 
the americas cup with a catamaran 
san diegos lawyer harold tyler told a fivejudge panel of the 
state supreme courts appellate division that the us yacht club 
did nothing barred by the deed of gift the 1887 document governing 
the races and the silver cup 
he said state supreme court justice carmen ciparick was wrong 
when she ruled on march 28 that san diego had to forfeit the sailing 
trophy to the mercury bay boating club he said the cup should be 
returned to san diego 
attorney george thompkins argued for mercury bay that last 
septembers race was a mismatch between the conventional new zealand 
entry and the much faster doublehull catamaran and violated the 
spirit of friendly competition envisioned by the races founders 138 
years ago 
assistant attorney general david samuels speaking for the state 
as a trustee of the cup argued that the use of the catamaran is 
proper as the rules are written the rules need to be changed 
he said san diego had told ciparick before the race the type of 
boat it planned to use and she did not object samuels said san 
diego should be allowed to keep the cup and some less drastic remedy 
than forfeiture should be applied 
on july 15 1987 mercury bay challenged san diego holder of the 
cup at the time to race in a boat that was about 90 feet at the 
water line less than a year after the california clubs 1986 win 
over the royal perth yacht club of australia boats that big had not 
been raced in more than 50 years 
san diego rejected the challenge noting that foreign clubs were 
already preparing for a 1990 or 1991 race in socalled 12meter 
boats the number depends more on a complicated design formula than 
an actual dimension and would be unable to compete effectively on 
terms demanded by mercury bay 
the san diego club pointed out that every match since world war 
ii had been raced every three or four years in 12meter boats which 
actually are about 45 feet at the water line 
the san diego catamaran easily defeated mercury bays entry and 
the case has been in and out of court ever since 
the new york yacht club and the royal perth yacht club of 
australia asked the judges to affirm ciparicks ruling that san 
diego relinquish the cup to mercury bay

jack dash the cockney communist famous for his 
role in the strikes that plagued londons docks died thursday 
london hospital said he was 82 
it declined to give the cause of death 
dash prided himself on being involved in every london dock strike 
between 1945 and 1970 a colorful figure and gifted orator he was 
much in demand on the lecture circuit after his retirement 
born in south london dash was raised as an orphan and left 
school at 14 becoming a builder a firefighter and then a docker 
inspired by the novels of american author jack london he joined 
the british communist party in 1936 and devoted the rest of his 
working life to protecting the pay and jobs of the dockers 
the transport and general workers union to which he belonged 
barred communists from holding union office so dash operated 
strictly from the soapbox and became known as unofficial king of 
the docks 
although he unswervingly defended the soviet line he was a 
fervent british patriot always reminding listeners that this 
country invented the parliamentary and trade union tradition 
dash retired in 1969 and immediately organized a rent strike at 
his public housing project he also painted sculpted wrote an 
autobiography and became a tourist guide showing visitors around 
the city he loved im a bloody london chauvinist he would 
often say 
his wife ellen predeceased him 
in 1970 dash told an interviewer what he wanted inscribed on his 
tombstone 
here lies jack dash 
all he wanted was to separate them from their cash 
them he hastily added meant employers

senate majority leader george mitchell said 
thursday congress is caught in a vise of competing pressures on 
ethics reform but he promised action 
we do have a problem we have to act we will act mitchell 
said 
president bush at a news conference thursday night joined that 
call saying he hoped both republicans and democrats would avoid 
attacking each other 
id like to shift the gears and move into ethics legislation 
bush said when asked about a republican national committee memo 
attacking new house speaker thomas foley the latest salvo in a 
congress marked by charges of ethical violations 
weve got to do better bush said the ugliness of the 
climate is bad but he brushed aside demands from some democrats 
that republican national chairman lee atwater resign because of the 
memo 
earlier in the day mitchell said that skepticism about public 
officials is healthy but that a danger occurs when skepticism 
becomes cynicism and mistrust 
mitchell renewed his call for a ban on speaking fees coupled 
with a pay raise but he said members of congress are reluctant to 
risk the wrath of their constituents by voting themselves raises to 
make up for losing the fees 
one possibility he said would be to gradually lower limits on 
speech fees known as honoraria while gradually increasing 
congressional salaries 
mitchell dmaine spoke to a group of reporters in his capitol 
office at a time when congressional ethics issues have been brought 
to the fore by allegations that brought resignation announcements 
from house speaker jim wright and democratic whip tony coelho 
some of the allegations against wright concerned rules on 
honoraria while coelho has been criticized for a private investment 
deal 
mitchell said separate democratic and republican task forces in 
the senate are studying proposals for ethics reform but he said 
its difficult to act in a situation in which there is no clear 
consensus 
we hope in the near future to be able to go forward with some 
effort in the areas of banning speech fees known as honoraria 
and raising pay he said but he also said if prevailing public 
sentiment were the sole determining factor the pay of members of 
congress today would be exactly what it was 200 years ago 
one of the things we must do is find the proper balance 
between being responsive to the wishes of the electorate and 
applying ones best conscience and judgment as to what is best for 
the nation or the state as a whole 
we are caught in a vise between tremendous attention devoted to 
honoraria in the press and a public wholly disinterested in 
honoraria it puts members of congress squarely in a vise squarely 
in a difficult position we are caught in a vise 
mitchells comments amplified remarks made a day earlier by 
foley dwash who told reporters he hoped the house would act 
before years end on a new ethics package foley also said proposals 
would likely have to address the honoraria issue 
mitchell voiced interest in a bill introduced by sen 
christopher dodd dconn which would phase out speaking fees while 
gradually phasing in increases in lawmakers salaries 
several senators both democrat and republican have expressed 
to me that thats the only reasonable approach which some feel 
is the way out of a difficult situation he said 
members of the house and senate currently are paid 89500 a 
year although the top leaders make more than that both the house 
and senate by overwhelming margins defeated a proposed 50 percent 
pay raise early this year after a public outcry greeted the proposal 
mitchell said he would not set any arbitrary deadline for 
recommending ethics changes saying it was more important to find 
agreement on rules that provide more precise and definite 
standards for lawmakers he said a review also is needed of rules 
concerning acceptance of gifts 
he said he thought the increased press scrutiny of congressional 
ethics was legitimate but also said he doesnt think there has been 
a general deterioration in standards of behavior 
there has never been a time in history when there has been a 
total absence of public skepticism about public officials he 
said adding that that is a healthy thing in a democracy 
there is nothing new here there is a recurring theme in 
american history of course it is episodic mitchell said were 
in one of those periods when interest is high a danger occurs 
when the healthy skepticism becomes cynicism and mistrust 
mitchell said congress must address the questions of ethics 
reform and changes in campaign finance laws aimed at lessening the 
influence of special interests 
meanwhile rep david nagle diowa began circulating among 
house members a letter demanding that president bush ask for the 
resignation of republican national committee chairman lee atwater 
because of a party document which attacked speaker thomas s foley 
the rnc memo compared foleys record with that of rep barney 
frank dmass an acknowledged homosexual bush was said to be 
disgusted with the incident but he also expressed confidence in 
atwater who was his 1988 campaign chairman 
mark goodin a republican official who had been a press aide in 
the bush campaign claimed sole responsibility for the letter and 
resigned 
these things dont happen in a political party unless the chief 
signs off on it said nagle who was chairman of the iowa 
democratic party if bush fails to get rid of atwater it will hurt 
the presidents credibility when he asks for bipartisan cooperation 
he said 
but the president recalling a conversation with atwater about 
the memo said he looked me right in the eye and said he did not 
know about it and and i respect that 
bush said foley had been done a terrible ill service by this 
and likened the attack to those made against former sen john tower 
whose nomination by bush to be defense secretary was doomed by 
accusations about towers drinking and womanizing 
i have great respect for tom foley and hes the one who says 
the matter should be closed and hes right bush said in calling 
for an end to the partisan warfare let met just repeat it was 
disgusting its against everything that ive stood for in political 
life

some have suggested that to show our forcefulness that i bring 
the american ambassador james lilley back i disagree with that 
180 degrees bush said at his first primetime news conference of 
his presidency 
the president insisted that his decision to leave the lilley in 
beijing was more productive than recalling him to washington just to 
show us displeasure 
calling lilley our very able ambassador bush pointed out 
that he had played a key role in helping win the release of cbs 
reporter richard roth who had been caught up in the tiananmen 
square disturbances and held by chinese authorities overnight 
we have seen in the last few days a very good reason to have 
him there bush said 
bush defended as appropriate the sanctions he announced on 
monday suspension of military aid in response to the chinese 
militarys masscre of thousands of prodemocracy demonstrators in 
beijing 
but the president said the united states cannot return to 
totally normal relations with china unless that government 
recognizes the validity of the prodemocracy movement 
bush said economic sanctions would be counterproductive and 
would hurt the people 
the president added however that if the situation does not 
improve he would take further steps at an appropriate time 
earlier baker said the uschinese relationship has suffered 
a tragic step backward but stressed that economic ties should 
be maintained to foster democratic reforms in china 
baker speaking at the national press club reported that all 
americans who had gotten to beijings airport had been flown out of 
the country 
were keeping our fingers crossed baker said of the 
evacuation of us dependents of diplomatic personnel which he 
ordered a day earlier after diplomatic compounds in the capital were 
strafed by gunfire 
the secretary had also appealed to private us citizens to leave 
the country as soon as possible 
baker said that a power struggle appeared to be underway in the 
wake of the sunday massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators and that 
the situation was still too clouded to tell exactly who is in 
charge 
he called the bloody massacre of the chinese protesters tragic 
and deplorable 
baker also defended the decision to offer refuge to the chinese 
dissident fang lizhi who is in the us embassy in beijing with his 
wife and son 
china has accused the united states of interfering in its 
domestic affairs by harboring the astrophysicist who had been 
prevented from attending a dinner with president bush during the 
presidents visit to beijing in february 
the secretary said he would not discuss whether fang has sought 
asylum but noted that the dissident asked for refuge and we 
granted that refuge 
baker made a point of saying that the united states has worked 
hard to improve ties with china since relations were formalized in 
1979 
weve spent many years in improving relations between the us 
and china in encouraging the movement towards democracy baker 
said adding weve had a very tragic step backward 
it is vital he said that the united states recognize the 
importance of this relationship 
asked whether bush intended to take additional steps against the 
chinese beyond cutting military sales and freezing military 
exchanges baker said the president reserved the right to review 
all options 
baker noted that bush has determined that its important that 
we maintain the economic relationships that exist now adding that 
recent turmoil appeared to be due to the fact that economic reforms 
in china were more advanced than political changes 
those economic reforms are what led to the opening up that we 
saw before this recent tragic and unfortunate and deplorable 
crackdown baker said adding we think its important that we 
maintain depending upon the future course of events there 
these economic ties because those are the things that for the most 
part have led to a move toward openness 
baker defended us ambassador james lilley and the us embassy 
in beijing against criticism that not enough was being done to aid 
americans leaving the country 
lilley and his team have been extraordinarly responsive to 
the needs of americans in china baker said adding that not one 
us citizen had been killed in the violence and that only one had 
been injured 
baker pointed out that the us government has chartered 
commercial aircraft to fly to beijing and shanghai to supplement 
regular us airline departures also officials have organized 
convoys to help us citizens get to the airports 
he cited united continental and northwest airlines for being 
quick to respond to the state departments request for help 
on wednesday baker ordered the 258 dependents of us government 
personnel in china to leave and urged other americans throughout 
the country to leave as well 
that step came after troops sprayed beijing diplomatic compounds 
with gunfire also reports from china have indicated that 
disturbances had spread to more than a dozen provincial cities 
some 8800 americans had notified us officials in january that 
they were in china 
later thursday state department spokesman adam shub said the 
us embassy in beijing had reported it knew of 115 americans with 
official ties still in the city 
that includes 11 nondiplomats one of them the ambassadors 
wife plus other dependents people who work in the embassy and two 
children whose parents are both members of the diplomatic staff 
shub said 
the state department estimated that there are some 5000 private 
us citizens left in china and 400 to 500 in beijing including a 
number of american students who have refused to leave their 
univerity campuses in the capital city

a tugboat skipper convicted of trying to 
smuggle 56 tons of hashish and marijuana through the golden gate was 
sentenced thursday to life in prison without parole 
us district judge john vukasin said calvin robinson is a 
criminal profiteer without any redeeming qualities who deserved 
to be put behind bars for life in the toughest penitentiary the us 
bureau of prisons could find 
prior to the sentencing a belligerent robinson told the judge 
when you put that chain around my ankle youll be putting it 
around your own neck 
robinson 47 who acted as his own lawyer during the trial 
received the maximum sentence including a 4 million fine 
in february a jury found robinson guilty of six charges 
connected to his 1988 attempt to float hashish and marijuana valued 
at 175 million into san francisco bay behind the welded panels of a 
barge 
assistant us attorney laurie gray described the drug haul as 
the largest of its kind in us history enough dosage units for 
a drug hit for every man woman and child in the united states 
the prosecutor said robinson deserved the maximum because of the 
enormity of the drug haul that he had brought eight members of his 
family into his criminal enterprise that he has a criminal record 
going back to his teens and that he tried twice to escape custody 
there are no drugs shouted robinson in reply thats a 
bunch of malarkey i havent been engaged in any criminal conduct 
i didnt drag my family into this im being persecuted 
robinson told the judge he meant his earlier chain remark 
figuratively in that he regarded the sentence as a miscarriage of 
justice and both he and the judge were therefore victims the judge 
said he regarded it as a threat

a university of chicago study released thursday 
suggests that federal officials may be significantly underestimating 
the number of americans with aids and that there are more whites and 
fewer blacks with the disease than previously believed 
edward o laumann of the national opinion research center at the 
university of chicago said that estimates by the federal centers for 
disease control of the numbers of aids case are distorted because 
affluent whites can afford to be treated discreetly by physicians 
who do not report the disease 
he said in a telephone interview that there also are cases that 
are not reported due to bureaucratic problems that slow the count or 
misfile cases 
the cdc makes its estimate based on cases reported to official 
agencies an undercount or a failure to report cases could seriously 
affect the cdc estimate said laumann 
we are contending that there is an undercount but we dont 
know the scale of it said laumann who coauthored a report 
appearing friday in the journal science we can estimate the 
demographic composition but not the gross numbers themselves the 
reason were being cautious is that this is too small a sample 
president bush questioned about the need for mandatory reporting 
of new aids cases said he would not favor any type of reporting 
that would jeopardize the patients right to privacy 
theres a lot of suffering a lot of human tragedy out there 
bush said adding that anything less than absolutely discreet 
handling would not be helpful in fighting the aids epidemic 
bush answering questions at a televised news conference thursday 
night said that people should be encouraged to talk to their 
doctors frankly about aids 
to gather data for the aids study laumann and his associates 
conducted interviews of 1481 households around the country the 
households were selected to reflect a cross section of the 
population 
each respondent was asked if he knew an acquaintance who had 
aids to validate the accuracy of the answers the respondents also 
were asked if they had an acquaintance who had been murdered 
earlier studies had proven that response to the homicide survey 
accurately reflected the actual number of murders this suggested 
that answers to the aids question would be equally accurate 
the results said the study suggest that the white proportion 
of aids cases is substantially higher than cdc reports and that a 
substantially greater share of the cases is in the midwestern 
region 
according to cdc figures from march 7 whites compose about 60 
percent of the nations aids cases the university of chicago study 
said the correct number is 72 percent 
the cdc said that 26 percent of all cases are black and 14 
percent are hispanic the chicago results estimate these totals as 
18 percent for blacks and 6 percent for hispanics 
cases in the midwest according to the cdc make up only 8 
percent of the national total the chicago study said that midwest 
cases actually compose 20 percent of the national total 
the comparative figures for other regions 
east cdc 39 percent of the national total chicago 19 percent 
south cdc 26 percent chicago 25 percent 
west cdc 27 percent chicago 36 percent 
laumann said that logic alone suggested something wrong with 
the cdc figures for the midwest chicago he said has all of the 
aids risk factors such as a population of injection drug users 
and yet the city was said to have only 31 cases of aids per 10000 
residents compared to a national total of 37 cases per 10000 
also he said according to the cdc figures colorado at the 
time of the 1988 survey had an absolute number of aids cases that 
was equal to or even exceeded that of michigan and colorado has 38 
percent of the population of michigan laumann said that michigan 
also has big cities where the aids risk factors are common 
that just doesnt make sense he said 
laumann submitted the chicago study to officials at the cdc for 
comment and he said these results dont surprise them 
they know that sexually transmitted diseases are generally 
undercounted for the white population because people go to personal 
physicians and one of their things they are doing is buying some 
discretion about it he said 
he said cases were undercounted in the midwest because of a 
flawed system of data collection by official agencies noting 
theres been a scandal for sometime about the aids office in 
chicago and how inadequate it was 
gayle lloyd a spokesperson for the centers for disease control 
in atlanta said there were no officials available to comment on the 
new study 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is fatal disease 
caused by a virus that is spread most frequently by sexual 
intercourse or by the sharing of needles among intravenous drug 
users 
through the month of april the cdc reports that aids had been 
diagnosed in 94280 americans of whom more than half or 53544 
have died since june 1 1981 no one is known to have recovered from 
aids 
science which reported the chicago study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

president bush on thursday urged soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev demonstrate his desire for change 
by responding positively and quickly to us proposals to cut 
conventional forces in europe 
i think he has already demonstrated his commitment to change 
and to reform bush told an evening news conference declaring 
i want to see perestroika succeed not fail 
earlier in the day secretary of state james a baker iii said 
the administration hope gorbachev will respond to the us proposal 
when he visits west germany next week 
bush also extended a hand of friendship and congratulations to 
the people poland who in the first democratic elections there since 
world war ii gave a resounding vote of no confidence in the 
communist government 
the president said that when he travels to poland next month he 
will tell its leaders that we want to work with you 
the quest for democracy in poland if it goes forward will 
mean a much better relationship for poland with the united states 
he said 
bush said the soviet leader has already demonstrated that he is 
interested in new thinking one of the elements of gorbachevs 
perestroika or restructuring 
but theres ways now to solidify these changes said the 
president urging gorbachev to accept the us offer to cut its 
305000 troops in central europe to 275000 if the soviets cut their 
600000 troops to that level as well 
what is wrong with being equal said bush so heres a test 
now 
the president acknowledged that some disagreements remained 
between the united states and west germany over whether to modernize 
lance shortrange nuclear missiles but said a conventional forces 
agreement could solve that problem 
it is in our interests to quickly move forward because if we 
can get implemented within our time frame the agreement on 
conventional forces that will take a tremendous amount of pressure 
off the germans on shortrange forces said the president 
baker said that soviet acceptance of the us proposal to reduce 
nato and warsaw pact forces to the same level would substantially 
reduce the threat of surprise military attack and the danger of 
largescale offensive operations against western europe 
the time is ripe for mr gorbachev to respond positively to the 
opportunities presented by natos initiatives said baker 
the secretary of state said the us proposals offer the soviets 
the opportunity both to channel resources from the military to the 
civilian sector and to accelerate the process of political reform in 
eastern europe 
our proposals point clearly to a longterm dramatic 
transformation in europes strategic and political landscape he 
said 
answering questions following his prepared remarks baker 
said officials from the united states and the palestine 
liberation organization meeting in tunis thursday considered 
practical ways to achieve a comprehensive middle east settlement 
based on united nations resolutions 
called for a bipartisan agreement with the congress on a new 
policy aimed at hastening an end to south africas apartheid system 
he said a recent statement by south african foreign minister pik 
botha that his partys platform for national elections will affirm 
the need to abolish apartheid is a significant step 
declared the administration isvery hopeful that organization 
of american states mediators will make progress towards bringing 
about a democratic transfer of power in panama 
indicated he was not impressed by an iranian proposal under 
which iran will help free american hostages in lebanon if the united 
states tries to win freedom for iranians held by christian forces in 
lebanon baker said the united states provided information on the 
iranian hostages to iran in 1982 he urged iran to help bring about 
the immediate release of the american hostages

but bush was firm in his support for the students who are 
agitating for democracy theyre not trying to flee china theyre 
trying to change china he said 
bush was asked whether chinese leader deng xiaoping was still in 
charge 
im trying to say that i dont know and you dont know and he 
doesnt know she doesnt know bush said pointing around the 
room of reporters nobody knows outside china thats the way 
the chinese system works 
i simply cannot tell you with authority who is calling the 
shots 
the president was reluctant to directly blame any chinese 
official for the military crackdown and massacre of students 
saying i dont want to pass judgement on individual leaders 
pressed on whether the united states could have normal relations 
with anyone responsible for the killings bush replied it would 
make it extraordinarily difficult however he said the question 
was so hypothetical that im going to avoid answering it 
directly 
bush said he was disappointed in the course of events since he 
visited china in february armed people dont shoot down unarmed 
students he said 
bush said he was satisfied with the military sanctions he 
announced on monday morning but suggested that if the situation 
does not improve he would take further steps at an appropriate 
time 
bush had a oneword description for the republican national 
committee circular comparing foleys voting record with that of rep 
barney frank a homosexual house member from massachusetts 
disgusting 
but he deflected a questioner who asked whether party chairman 
lee atwater should be called to account 
he looked me right in the eye bush said of his handpicked 
gop boss and said he did not know about it bush noted that 
atwater moved promptly to remove the person who said he did know 
about it and i respect that rnc communications director mark 
goodin announced his resignation on wednesday after saying he had 
written the material 
of foley the president said hes the one who says the matter 
should be closed and hes right 
bush seemed eager to drop the subject and said it was time for 
congress to adopt tough ethics legislation 
the white house said bush since taking office jan 20 has had 
from 16 to 23 news conferences depending on how you define a news 
conference the sessions have ranged in length from just a few 
minutes to more than 45 minutes 
all his previous news conferences were held during the day and 
none was conducted in the formal setting of the east room 
by holding a news conference in televisions primetime hours 
bush assured himself of a large viewing audience the major 
commercial television networks were broadcasting the session 
the president personally decided the arrangement of the east room 
for the news conference changing the setting that ronald reagan 
used 
reagan used to make a dramatic entrance striding down the 
redcarpeted marblecolumned cross hall to reach the east room 
where reporters sat facing him across the length of the room 
bush opted for a less regal entrance from an adjacent state 
room with reporters seated on his left as he came into the east 
room 
vice president dan quayle who had lunch with the president said 
bush was ready to knock it right out of the ballpark 
white house officials said bush unlike reagan did not make 
extensive preparations for the news conference actually his second 
one this week after mondays announcement of a freeze in 600 
million in military sales to china 
reagan used to study sample questions and hold dress rehearsals 
at which his staff asked him questions 
white house deputy press secretary b jay cooper said bush was 
doing nothing special other than talking with chief of staff 
john sununu press secretary marlin fitzwater and deputy national 
security adviser robert gates 
cooper said national security adviser brent scowcroft was in los 
angeles giving reagan a periodic briefing on national security 
matters 
quayle during a picturetaking session with visiting soviet 
editor sergey grigoryants said bushs actions against china 
including a suspension of all arms sales but not the imposition of 
broad commercial sanctions has good support in the congress 
and that the american people feel the president is acting in a 
prudent and a wise manner 
in another development a spokesman for former president nixon 
said bush called nixon on monday and talked with him about 10 
minutes before announcing the steps he was taking in retaliation for 
chinas crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
john taylor the spokesman said he had no information on the 
content of the call nixon renewed us ties with beijing in 1972 
after years of diplomatic isolation

the nuclear regulatory commission said thursday 
it now requires random drug and alcohol tests of workers at all us 
nuclear power plants 
the rule takes effect july 7 and applies to all plants whether 
operating or under construction 
many utilities already conduct random tests for drug and alcohol 
use by their plant workers but the commission said it wanted to 
assure that such testing is uniform 
the commission in recent months has expressed concern at 
increasing evidence that illegal drugs are used by some nuclear 
plant workers including reactor operators 
the new regulation prohibits the use of alcohol prior to and 
during work and also requires plant owners to find ways to contain 
the use of prescription and overthecounter drugs and to address 
other health problems such as fatigue 
the rule requires drug testing of all workers who have security 
clearances for unescorted access to nuclear plants as well as 
random followup testing of these workers 
tests for alcohol use are to be performed at the same time 
a concentration of alcohol in the blood of 004 percent would be 
considered a violation of the rule utilities may adopt even 
stricter limits if they choose 
some people might show show a concentration after one drink many 
states use 010 percent as evidence of drunken driving 
workers who test positive for either alcohol or illegal drugs are 
to be denied access to protected areas and removed from their work 
duties they may return later if they are deemed fit to do so 
a second confirmed positive test would mean a work suspension for 
at least three years 
involvement in the sale use or possession of illegal drugs by 
anyone within a secure area of a nuclear plant would mean suspension 
for at least five years any subsequent use of drugs or alcohol 
would mean permanent suspension 
for plant construction sites the rule requires that utilities 
seeking their operating licenses implement random drug and alcohol 
testing and impose sanctions on users

a special adviser to president bush said 
thursday the soviet union is still sending weapons to nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista regime despite assurances given the united 
states that such aid would stop 
soviet aid to the sandinistas continues at the same level as 
before edward l rowny special adviser to bush on arms control 
told a news conference in mexico city 
we have no evidence that the aid has slackened or lessened on 
the contrary we have incontrovertible evidence that it continues 
rowny said 
rowny confirmed news reports that a high soviet official had told 
secretary of state james baker in moscow last may that the soviet 
union was cutting off military aid to nicaragua 
he refused to name the soviet official other than calling him a 
high authoritative source who knew what he was talking about 
saying it would not be diplomatically proper for him to do so 
rowny was on a trip to mexico and brazil to brief leaders of the 
countries and seek their reactions to bushs latest proposals to the 
soviet union for reducing armaments he also was to brief them on 
bushs meeting with representatives of nato nations in brussels last

a man who searched in 11 states for his two 
sons was reunited with the boys wednesday 9 years after their 
mother took them to a christmas party and never returned 
gerald gromer said after meeting with his sons mark 14 and 
luke 12 for the first time since 1979 that the boys were upset and 
bewildered at being separated from the mother who police say 
abducted them 
the reunion was held wednesday morning behind closed doors in a 
state police barracks 
their father a 34yearold moose lodge manager from bourbonnais 
ill described the reunion as not the happiest we have lots of 
things to work out in the next couple of months but were going to 
make it 
after the boys were turned over to their father a superior court 
judge issued a temporary restraining order late wednesday afternoon 
saying the boys were to stay in vermont until a court hearing 
thursday 
but before the order could be served on gromer he and the boys 
had boarded a flight from burlington to chicago 
the boys mother loretta gromer frey allegedly took the two 
boys and fled illinois with a religious group in 1979 after their 
father had been awarded custody by a divorce court 
the group settled in vermont several years ago but moved around 
to several locations in the state said sgt jean lessard of the 
state police 
ms frey was arrested in woodbury on tuesday on a warrant 
charging her with child abduction state police said 
gromer was told tuesday that his children had been found ending 
a search in which he said he said he spent more than 20000 and 
traveled to 11 states 
gromer said his sons would not answer questions or comment 
publicly he said they cant understand why they have to go back 
to illinois and why i cant come to vermont to join their church 
gromer described the church which went by the name his community 
in illinois but uses the name christ covenant church in vermont as 
a cult he said his children had been somewhat brainwashed 
lessard in a separate interview said police did not consider 
the group a cult wed rather refer to it as a communal church 
he said 
gromers second wife sue said they learned that the boys had 
been found tuesday morning weve either been in police stations 
or on planes or at home packing since then 
ms frey 34 faced a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid 
prosecution as well as the state charge for which she was ordered 
held under 75000 bail pending extradition to illinois 
gromer said that when his estranged wife abducted the chilren 
the whole church group about 100 people up and left town on a 
single day 
lessard said the church group included some children but that 
gromers was the only case in which the children left against the 
will of the person who had custody 
his community was founded by roman catholics in the kankakee 
ill area as a bible study group in the 1970s said the rev james 
mcdermott who worked with the group at its early meetings 
protestants joined in and the group evolved into a cult with 
strong leadership said mcdermott 
they decided to leave they were going to be the new exodus 
from egypt mcdermott said

house opponents of the bush administrations 
planned 6 billion fsx fighter deal with japan are far short of the 
votes needed to override an expected presidential veto 
a measure to restrict the deal passed the house on wednesday but 
only on a 262155 vote far less than the twothirds margin of 290 
needed to override a veto in the 435member chamber 
the administration already has agreed to develop the fighter 
jointly with japan the measure passed wednesday seeks to stipulate 
the us negotiating position in future talks on how the fsx an 
advanced version of the f16 jet fighter actually will be produced 
an identical senate resolution passed 7227 on may 16 
opponents of the deal say it amounts to a giveaway of critical 
us defense technology but the bush administration says the 
restrictive legislation would tie its hands in the talks

senate majority leader george mitchell said 
thursday congress is caught in a vise of competing pressures on 
ethics reform but he promised action 
we do have a problem we have to act we will act mitchell 
said 
he said that skepticism about public officials is healthy but 
that a danger occurs when skepticism becomes cynicism and 
mistrust 
mitchell renewed his call for a ban on speaking fees coupled 
with a pay raise but he said members of congress are reluctant to 
risk the wrath of their constituents by voting themselves raises to 
make up for losing the fees 
one possibility he said would be to gradually lower limits on 
speech fees known as honoraria while gradually increasing 
congressional salaries

a house panel chairman thursday distributed 
federal data identifying 205 industrial plants as increasing cancer 
risks through release of airborne toxic chemicals the environmental 
protection agency quickly disputed his interpretations 
an epa spokesman said the information was old and incomplete and 
complained it was highly irresponsible to use it as reflective 
of risks in the real world 
however rep henry a waxman chairman of the house energy and 
commerce environment subcommittee said that even potentially 
inaccurate figures should be released because they indicate the 
enormity of the problem and represent a stunning demonstration 
of the urgency of the public health threat 
waxman dcalif said at a news conference that toxic chemicals 
present a cancer risk near the plants at least a thousandfold 
greater than levels accepted by experts 
the plants on the list compiled by the epa pose at least a 
1in1000 cancer risk to people getting maximum exposure for a 
lifetime while the epa deems a risk of more than 1inamillion as 
unacceptable

a university of chicago study released thursday 
suggests that federal officials may be significantly underestimating 
the number of americans with aids and that there are more whites and 
fewer blacks with the disease than previously believed 
edward o laumann of the national opinion research center at the 
university of chicago said that estimates by the federal centers for 
disease control of the numbers of aids case are distorted because 
affluent whites can afford to be treated discreetly by physicans who 
do not report the disease 
he said in a telephone interview that there also are cases that 
are not reported due to bureacratic problems that slow the count or 
misfile cases 
the cdc makes its estimate based on cases reported to official 
agencies an undercount or a failure to report cases could seriously 
affect the cdc estimate said laumann

deep inside cheyenne mountain the 
militarys nuclear detection force uses outdated equipment to 
protect the nation from attack officials say a 13 billion 
upgrading now under way will not be completed for years 
green phosphor radar monitors surplus from the federal aviation 
administration were designed back in the 1950s to track airplanes 
not to monitor the globe for missiles according to those who use 
them they call the washingmachinesize monitors green monsters 
nearby is the phone they would use to contact the president in 
the event of a nuclear attack its wired downstairs through an 
oldfashioned plugin switchboard 
theres a lot of antiquated stuff at cheyenne mountain theres 
no doubt about it said lt col rick oborn a pentagon spokesman 
the facility was built in 1957 more than 693000 tons of granite 
were removed from cheyenne mountain outside colorado springs to make 
way for 15 buildings housing 700 people they work behind 30ton 
blast doors 1400 feet inside the mountain 
the cheyenne mountain complex built at a cost of 142 million 
was originally designed to track airplanes that could launch a 
nuclear attack against the united states when the soviet union 
entered the space age monitoring missile launches became an added 
duty 
the facility has been criticized by both congress and its 
watchdog agency the general accounting office for failure to keep 
pace with technology for project delays and for cost overruns 
although the centers airplane tracking computer has been 
improved the updating of three other computers used to track 
submarines missiles and some 7000 objects floating in space will 
not be finished until at least 1994 
methods used to gather the raw tracking data used at cheyenne 
mountain are classified but it is known that some information comes 
from satellites some from intelligence sources including spies 
wiretaps and monitored radio conversations and much from 
groundbased equipment 
work on updating cheyenne mountain is proceeding slowly because 
of mistakes made in the past said col glen p doss director of 
missile warning for the air force space command which oversees 
operations at norad the north american aerospace defense command 
the switchboard will eventually give way to a modern 
communications system the green monsters where missiles and subs 
show up as green dots on dinnerplatesize screens are to be 
replaced with multicolor displays 
the centers aircraft trackers are already using the new 
equipment to follow as many as 50 planes at a time on a screen 
where they were once represented by a jumble of green numbers the 
aircraft now are categorized by color 
you can look at the green friendlies and the red unknowns 
said a canadian officer in charge one recent day at the joint 
uscanadian tracking center 
i can look at a screen and get five times the amount of 
information as with the old 1950s technology he said 
replacing the communications system is estimated to cost 255 
million replacing the display system will cost 268 million and 
putting in a survivable communications integration system will cost 
135 million 
the project to replace the computer system to track satellites is 
already over budget behind schedule and cant perform many of the 
functions required according to a new gao report the system was 
originally expected to cost 290 million but will now cost 437 
million the system was supposed to be operating by june 1988 but 
wont be completed until 1994 the gao said 
the military is even planning a backup center in case cheyenne 
mountain were destroyed construction began in april on the 
underground facility at offutt air force base in nebraska 
on a recent day in cheyenne mountains air defense operations 
room a team of military officers monitored the flights of two 
soviet bear delta bombers off the coast of iceland the planes on a 
routine patrol were are not considered a threat 
these trackers have two minutes to identify an aircraft that 
enters us airspace if it is not identified they scramble jet 
fighters 
now by pointing a mouse or computer pointer at the dot 
representing a particular plane or submarine the trackers can see 
its latitude longitude designation and other details with the 
old system planes and subs could only be tracked with paper and 
pencil 
in a room deeper inside the mountain an officer using a green 
monster kept track of three soviet submarines in the norwegian sea 
they showed up as dots with their classification beside them 
indicating they were capable of carrying nuclear ballistic missiles 
another officer tracked the soviets unmanned mir space station 
over australia 
the sub and missile monitoring area using satellites with 
infrared cameras is at the heart of cheyenne mountains operation 
the command post the trackers work in a temporary facility 
slightly larger than the average living room while a new 178 
million command center is being built next door 
to their right are the battle stations each with red telephones 
for officers who would help direct americas nuclear war 
when the soviets launch a missile the front door of the command 
center is locked tight there are no klaxon horns just the 
beepbeepbeep of the command network telephone alerting all points 
that a missile is airborne 
the launch shows up as a triangle on a green monster with the 
fan of the triangle showing the missiles general direction 
the commander in chief of norad is notified and he stays on the 
phone until the missile is considered safe 
in these days of detente the soviets usually give us 
authorities advance notice of launches intelligence officials pass 
the word to cheyenne mountain but sometimes the officers keep it a 
secret to see how their trackers perform 
in 1979 a technician placed a training tape with missile warning 
events into a newly installed computer tracking system and the 
command center thought the united states was under attack and went 
on alert norad officials said later that year it happened again 
when a computer chip failed and began feeding erroneous information 
into the system officials reported 
as that system is replaced col louis a kouts director of 
space defense and surveillance said he hopes to avoid the mistakes 
that were made installing it all at once instead of in segments 
another problem then was that some of the computers could not 
exchange information as needed norad officials said 
despite gao criticism of the new system doss defended it and 
said he is trying to do something that has never been done with 
computers before save money by using equipment off the shelf rather 
than getting it specially designed 
unfortunately cost is a factor here i have to worry about it 
every day he said

with the vast indian ocean to its south 
and uneasy neighbors to its north india is building up its military 
might 
india is a mini superpower in the making a western military 
expert said 
its array of weapons includes a nuclearpowered submarine 
aircraft carriers mig29 fighter planes and recently acquired 
mediumrange ballistic missile capability indian and western 
military analysts say the country is developing a power projection 
well beyond the asian subcontinent 
the nation of 880 million people has 136 million men in uniform 
the worlds fourthlargest force in terms of manpower after the 
soviet union china and the united states 
the 115000man air force with 870 planes ranks behind only the 
united states and the soviet union in the crucial field of heavy 
combat airlift capability 
india also has been one of the worlds largest arms importers 
since 1986 
more than 25000 scientists and engineers are working in 15 
laboratories and 60 research centers on hundreds of major weapons 
electronics and other defenserelated developments the government 
is spending 1 billion a year on research and developments projects 
alone 
india is developing such a military might especially in the 
air force and navy that it is amounting to giving notices to 
superpowers that their roles in the region are subject to check 
said the western military expert who represents a nato and would 
speak only on conditiion of anonymity 
on may 22 india successfully testfired its firstmedium range 
ballistic missile becoming only the seventh nation in the world 
with the demonstrated ability to make its own ballistic missiles 
the 12 millionman army is adding four new divisions to the 
existing 34 an increase of 80000 combat soldiers 
indigenous weapons already tested or under development include 
light combat aircraft pilotless aircraft cluster bombs 
highaltitude parachutes light field guns main battle tanks 
armored personnel carriers advanced panoramic sonar to detect enemy 
submarines variable depth sonar homing torpedoes antisubmarine 
electric torpedoes mines and minebreaching equipment and a new 
range of small arms and wheeled vehicles 
india is also building a superport in the southern state of 
karnataka for developing submarines and ships including its own 
30000ton aircraft carrier 
a longrange reconnaissance aircraft capable of patrolling as 
far as australia and africa is in the planning stage 
india is the only country outside the soviet bloc to have 
acquired the soviet unions latest mig29 fighters negotiations are 
under way to build mig29s in india 
indias two aircraft carriers give the 53000man navy a 
constantly available fixedwing seaborne air power 
given the vast coastline 3525 miles the naval strength is 
not much but at least we have a bluewater navy now said a 
defense ministry official speaking on condition he not be 
identified 
our aim is to be selfsufficient we are not gearing our armed 
forces for battle it is just the opposite we believe all these 
will work as deterrents 
india has fought three wars with neighboring pakistan since 
independence from britain in 1947 but its biggest rival in the 
region is china with whom it fought a border war in 1962 and lost 
territory 
the indian navy has 14 submarines including a nuclearpowered 
sub leased from the soviet union and it is trying to lease three 
more nuclearpowered subs from the soviets 
indias most recent achievement was the test firing of the 
mediumrange agni missile named for the hindu fire god 
the missile has a range of 1550 miles capable of reaching china 
in the east and as far west as iran the twostage rocket can 
deliver a oneton payload enough to carry a nuclear warhead 
according to indian military experts 
india exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago but insists its 
nuclear program is for peaceful purposes western military experts 
say however indian scientists could assemble a nuclear warhead in 
a weeks time 
the agni test capped a missile development program that started 
in 1983 
however the western military expert said it would be years 
before india could put its capabilities to use 
it is one thing to develop something but another to use it

for more than a century the elks club has 
chosen the kind of members it believes stand for the american ideals 
of equality charity and brotherhood for all that time almost all 
of them have been white men 
even in cities as racially diverse as los angeles elks lodges 
remain the preserve of the white male with written rules that ban 
women and voting procedures that critics say stack the deck against 
blacks 
but that may be changing according to civil libertarians and 
legal experts because of recent challenges to the membership 
practices of the 121yearold benevolent and protective order of 
elks 
several california lodges have threatened to go to court if they 
are unsuccessful in persuading the national organization at its 
convention next month in atlanta to change voting rules to admit 
more black members 
the california attorney generals office is investigating 
possible civil rights violations by a lompoc lodge that rejected two 
black applicants 
and a utah woman rejected for membership in a st george lodge 
has filed a sex discrimination lawsuit against the elks club 
elks leaders have strongly defended the club against all 
challenges contending that members have a constitutional right to 
associate with whomever they choose but legal experts say that the 
elks will be held to the same civil rights laws the courts have 
applied to the rotary club and other organizations 
ultimately they say the elks will be forced to change their 
ways 
the supreme court has been very clear that it is not at all 
solicitous and protective of groups that want to discriminate 
said erwin chemerinsky law professor at the university of southern 
california and an expert on civil rights litigation im sure that 
would include the elks 
the accusations of racism and sexism and the prospect of change 
in membership have rattled elks leaders and tarnished the reputation 
of the 16 millionmember group whys everybody picking on the 
elks asks spokesman robert yothers i wish somebody would tell 
the true story the good side of the elks club 
the elks project an image as american as the flag its members 
donating their time and money to everything from rodeos to pancake 
breakfasts the club raised 53 million last year for charity 
nationally 
critics say the true story is actually an unusual mixture of 
charity and discrimination 
for most of its history the elks explicitly limited membership 
to white men in 1973 the bylaws were changed to include all men 
but women still were banned and voting rules that gave great power 
to a small group of members has effectively kept out blacks 
in the los angeles area for example the 13 elks lodges have 
more than 9000 members none of them women none of them black and 
only a smattering of them asian and hispanic according to lodge 
officials most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity one lodge 
exalted ruler said he was unaware of the change in rules to allow 
black members his lodge has never had one 
critics find it ironic that lodge members who are willing to 
raise money for charitable groups serving black children are 
unwilling to share a drink in the lodge with a black businessman 
collegebound girls are given elks scholarships but 
collegeeducated women cant join the lodge 
it just makes you feel a little disappointed that this sort of 
thing could be happening in this day and age said ernest 
hutchinson 57 a santa barbara county housing official who was one 
of the two blacks rejected this year by the lodge in lompoc 140 
miles northwest of los angeles 
the other was joe martin 56 a realtor the two have been told 
that fewer than a dozen lodge members cast no votes by placing 
black marbles into the voting box even though nearly 140 members 
supported them elks voting rules require only three black marbles 
to reject or blackball an applicant 
i truly felt deep down in my heart that they would accept me 
said martin but it is just a few bad apples i feel more pity for 
those people than anger at my situation 
the rejection of hutchinson and martin two longtime residents 
with many friends in the community and lodge outraged the city of 
31000 the newspaper printed angry editorials the school board 
refused to accept elks scholarships and a boycott of elks functions 
was in the works just last week the santa barbara city council 
voted to block donations from a local lodge part of lompocs 
region to citysponsored youth programs 
in late march deputy attorney general louis verdugo jr in los 
angeles confirmed that the state was investigating the lodge for 
possible violations of californias civil rights law the same law 
the us supreme court upheld in ordering the rotary club to admit 
women 
under community pressure the lompoc lodge and others in santa 
barbara county passed a resolution to urge the national grand lodge 
to change voting procedures to a twothirds majority if the 
national organization balks the california lodges plan to go to 
court with the naacp 
sure were concerned about opposing the grand lodge said 
butch simas elks western central coast district leader but we 
are willing to go against the national lodge 
while the california lodges prepare to challenge the voting 
rules sandra beynon of st george utah continues to battle her 
local lodge with a lot less fanfare for the right to become a 
member 
ms beynon a construction company manager denied membership in 
1987 contends the elks club is violating state liquor laws banning 
discrimination in most places that serve alcoholic beverages by the 
glass her suit is pending 
the local elks lodge in this state is one of few places where 
people can conduct business over a cocktail at lunch or a drink 
after work said her attorney brian barnard by excluding 
women the elks have denied a large segment of society of the right 
to develop business contacts 
the challenges to the elks membership practices in california and 
utah have rankled national elks leaders 
yothers denies that racism was at work in lompoc noting that no 
member of that lodge has admitted blackballing the two black 
applicants because of their race however he acknowledged that if 
they did make such an admission they would face expulsion from the 
lodge 
he also said it was illogical to admit women to the elks club 
which he calls a fraternal organization similar to a college 
fraternity you dont let women in fraternities and you dont let 
males in sororities this whole thing just doesnt make sense

for nearly 20 years alan heslop has 
been one of the republican partys top experts on redistricting 
drawing the maps and crunching the numbers to help the gop win us 
house seats 
but heslop has also used his skills to help hispanics in local 
reapportionment battles in los angeles phoenix and other states 
sometimes benefitting democratic politicians 
now the gop activist is reportedly at the top of president bushs 
list of nominees to head the us census bureau evoking strong 
reactions from some democrats worried he might tinker with the 1990 
census 
a political hit man is what california assembly speaker 
willie brown called heslop adding he has always been a very 
political operator 
brown told reporters the appointment of heslop to head the census 
bureau would guarantee an undercount of blacks and hispanics 
which brown said would be an absolute disaster for democrats 
heslop was chief reapportionment consultant to california 
republicans following the 1970 census he has maintained 
professional and social contact with gop leaders since he left 
sacramento in 1973 to establish the rose institute at claremont 
mckenna college near los angeles 
heslop a 51yearold oxfordeducated british immigrant is so 
publicityshy that a reader has to search the fine print to even 
find his name in the 34page annual report of the rose institute 
heslop refused all public comment since his name surfaced for the 
census post except for a response to brown 
no one is more concerned than i am with ensuring an accurate 
census count heslop said adding that to engage in some sort of 
rebuttal of statements made by willie brown about a position that 
has not yet been offered to me is nonsense 
browns judgment of heslop is not universal 
brown was intemperate unfair and just plain wrong instead 
of trying to undercount minorities heslop has sought ways of 
increasing their representation on lawmaking bodies said 
political editor martin smith of mcclatchy newspapers 
many california democrats have declined comment on browns 
charges with few willing to disagree with the powerful assembly 
speaker on the record 
heslops not attila the hun and hes certainly not a racist 
one california democrat said on the condition his name not be used 
tony quinn a former gop reapportionment consultant who is head 
of research for the california department of commerce said heslop 
is eminently qualified for the census post 
he has spent a lot of time on demographic issues heslop knows 
the west and southwest in particular and he has worked closely with 
minorities quinn said 
some democrats have read machiavellian motives into heslops 
assistance to minority political activists they contend that 
designing districts to put more minority politicians in office 
undercuts democratic attempts to spread the heavy democratic 
majorities of minority neighborhoods over more districts 
that view is disputed by richard santillan a hispanic activist 
who chairs the department of ethnic studies at california 
polytechnic university in pomona 
thats an invalid argument greater minority representation is 
going to help not hurt the democratic party what it may be 
undermining is the entrenched white leadership of the democratic 
party but its not undermining the party santillan said 
santillan added he always had suspicions that the rose 
institute was a republican front before he met heslop 
in 10 years working with him alan heslop has never overtly or 
subtly tried to slant our research or inhibit it santillan said 
there are people who produce statistics to help one party or the 
other but alan heslop has never done that 
politically im exactly opposite of alan heslopif he 
becomes the census director he will look to the latino community 
to the black community and to the asian community for input and it 
will be meaningful input santillan said 
the rose institute of state and local government is part of 
claremont mckenna college a private college with 840 students that 
is one of six related colleges sharing a single suburban campus 
about 30 miles east of downtown los angeles 
heslop serves as head of the political science department and 
director of the rose institute which is located in a former 
psychology lab on the campus it receives no subsidy from the 
college and operates as a nonprofit selfsupporting think tank 
the institute has spent more than 15 million over the past 
dozen years to build the california data base which has 
computerized 126 categories of political economic and other 
demographic data on californias 5000 census tracts and 26000 
voting precincts 
no one else at least this side of the mississippi has managed 
to combine political demographic data with advanced techniques of 
computer analysis to the extent that we have heslop said in a 
1984 interview 
the institute has received grants from businesses and foundations 
and has had contracts with political governmental and business 
groups to conduct studies use its database or host seminars 
the institutes 1988 annual report lists among its paying clients 
both the george bush and michael dukakis presidential campaigns the 
state of california the university of california los angeles 
county and businesses ranging from atampt to hughes aircraft 
the most controversial incident in the institutes history was a 
700000 project financed by a group of corporate executives known 
as the california roundtable to develop a model reapportionment 
plan for legislative and congressional districts following the 
1980 census 
heslop insisted that the plan was intended to be a nonpartisan 
yardstick for use in evaluating the plans produced by the 
legislature democrats denounced it as a sham to promote gop and 
conservative efforts

dame iris murdoch easily envisions the public for 
her novels its the chap sitting by the window reading or 
possibly rereading the book 
plays however are a different matter why do people go to the 
theater she asks why dont they stay home 
the comparisons spring readily to mind for dame iris whose new 
play the black prince is well into its london run 
the drama which opened april 25 at the aldwych theater marks 
the third west end play from the erstwhile philosophy professor and 
author of more than 20 novels beginning with under the net in 
1954 through to the awardwinning 1978 the sea the sea and 
the book and the brotherhood last year 
adapted from her 1973 novel of the same name the black 
prince casts ian mcdiarmid long a mainstay of the royal 
shakespeare company as a tax assessor named bradley pearson who 
nurses ambitions to be a great writer 
the black prince of the title refers to the greek muse 
apollo whom bradley invokes as the god of poetry and music but the 
play itself is specifically steeped in shakespeare particularly 
hamlet a play which bradley exalts as a monument of words 
a wild act of audacity 
the writing swings from black comedy to tragedy in a surreal 
finish that suggests her czech forbear franz kafka its among 
londons weightier more highbrow nights out and dame iris 
acknoweldged being uneasy about how long it will survive 
one does want a period of exposure she said in an interview 
she was encouraged to adapt the novel to the stage by her 
producer josephine hart wife of the advertising executive maurice 
saatchi 
i was interested naturally she said its jolly lonely 
being a novelist its occasionally a great pleasure to work in the 
theater 
she said a play is a totally different object from a novel 
its much more like a poem ones got to pack in a great deal 
of action and passion and explication she said every single 
line matters every word matters 
whereas theater profits from an economy of word and gesture 
novels can be more expansive and dame iris works have been likened 
to the rangy largescale fiction of such 19thcentury english and 
russian writers as george eliot and charles dickens lev tolstoy and 
fyodor dostoevsky 
such comparisons delight her 
in a humble way i feel very much i belong to that tradition of 
the novel said the author who was made a dame by queen elizabeth 
ii in 1987 
they are great sources of power so are men like henry james 
and im very attached to marcel proust 
her novels exert their own mysterious power with their 
alternately satiric and comic depictions of the witty and 
welleducated english tumbling into infidelities improprieties and 
violence murder in the book and the brotherhood suicide in 
the nice and the good and the good apprentice 
the black prince itself encompasses several deaths alongside 
lengthy ruminations about the function of art and the nature of 
illusion versus reality 
if you write a story dealing with conflicts of interest you 
encounter forms of violence of various sorts explained dame iris 
adding that she does not regard violence as any particular 
oddity 
her blueprint for novelwriting involves some quite complicated 
knot involving some character or a problem 
i think the imagination just works out of the darkness one has 
to sit and wait 
the irishborn daughter of a civil servant she moved to england 
with her parents as a baby oxfordeducated she lives in the 
university city today with her husband of 33 years english 
professor john bayley 
dame iris neither courts nor shuns publicity preferring to stick 
to a daily routine writing with a pen she loathes word processors 
in the morning followed by shopping and housework in the 
afternoon her husband cooks the evening meal 
her next novel the message to the planet will be published 
in britain on oct 2 and in the united states early next year while 
she claims to have forgotten what its about she feels her 
craft is improving 
my books have got longer but i also think theyve got better 
if one goes on practicing a craft up to a certain point one gets 
better she said 
art is very much a matter of courage and confidence too not 
just ability

in their search for a hip investment for the 
sophisticated 1990s some advisers are putting aside their computers 
and their calculators and recommending us savings bonds 
why such an old plainvanilla idea when so many newer and more 
exotic flavors are available 
well for one thing recent changes in the tax laws that 
drastically altered many money management strategies left savings 
bonds unscathed 
they are no way to get rich fast and they never will be but 
they are versatile practical and safe 
perhaps best of all they offer some measure of protection 
against just about any foreseeable financial misfortune whether the 
economy gets too hot or too cold 
whether saving for college or retirement us government 
series ee savings bonds offer an attractive taxsheltered 
investment for people at any income level says william brennan 
editor of the newsletter financial planning reporter published by 
the accounting firm of ernst amp whinney 
their variable interest rate with a 6 percent floor provides 
a doubleedged sword with which to fight either inflation or 
deflation 
furthermore say analysts at standard amp poors corp in the 
firms weekly publication the outlook just now with interest 
rates drifting lower series ee savings bonds have special appeal 
because they lock in yields for six months at a stretch 
the savings bond program revamped in 1982 has operated for 
decades on a system similar to the one adopted for modern vehicles 
known as zerocoupon bonds 
they are sold in denominations as small as 50 and as large as 
10000 for half their face value they provide no current cash 
distributions but instead appreciate gradually in value as interest 
on them accumulates and compounds 
provided that you hold them for at least five years the 
government guarantees an annual interest rate of 6 percent or 85 
percent of the yield available on fiveyear treasury securities 
whichever is higher 
the variable rate recalculated each may 1 and nov 1 currently 
stands at 781 percent through oct 31 brennan notes 
savings bonds tax shelter is twofold as the interest on 
them builds up you can choose not to pay any federal income tax on 
the interest until you cash in a bond 
in addition savings bond interest like that of other securities 
of the federal government is exempt from state and local income 
taxes 
with bonds bought any time starting jan 1 of next year there 
will be an extra kicker you can avoid any tax at all if you use the 
proceeds from them to pay for education expenses such as college 
tuition and your adjusted gross income on your tax return is 60000 
or less for a married couple 40000 or less for single filers 
savings bonds bought before next year dont qualify for this 
special treatment however suggests standard amp poors if you are 
holding older bonds in a college savings program you might consider 
cashing them in at some point and reinvesting the money in new ones 
that are eligible for the tuition tax break 
savings bonds can be bought without commissions or fees of any 
kind from banks savings institutions or through payroll savings 
plans offered by many employers 
a bank that does not carry an inventory of bonds in the larger 
denominations may provide you with the form necessary to order the 
bonds from your nearest federal reserve bank or branch 
the government promises to replace your bonds without a fuss if 
they are stolen lost or destroyed 
to be on the safe side advisers say make a list of the bonds 
you own their face amounts serial numbers and purchase dates and 
keep the list somewhere separate from where the bonds are stored 
that way youll be able to be very specific should you ever have 
to ask to have them replaced

steven banks is not easy to categorize hes a 
comedian actor rock musician and impressionist hes very funny 
and he has something to say 
his oneman tourdeforce steven banks home entertainment 
center has been packing them in on the west coast and viewers of 
the showtime cable network get a looksee beginning saturday 
the hourlong show was taped on stage at marines memorial theatre 
in san francisco this month banks begins an extended run at the 
canon theatre in beverly hills 
set in banks slovenly bachelor pad the show is a series of 
imaginative comic vignettes but in a larger sense its an inspiring 
story about being stuck in life at thirtysomething and taking a risk 
to get your dream 
it opens with banks coming home early from his deadend job in 
the corporate maze and donning his jammies so he can delve into his 
fantasy life as a rock star he cheers his own entrance with the 
chant banks banks banks banks 
his telephone messages include repeated and increasingly 
irritated calls from the office but also a surprise call from 
lance a highschool pal whos now a rock star 
the eccentric banks kitchen shelves are lined with boxes of 
duncan hines cookie mix the sink is full of dirty dishes and the 
walls plastered with posters of his musical heroes the slightest 
task be it talking on the phone or typing turns into a performance 
banks is being hounded by his boss mr buttle to finish writing 
a speech that was due that afternoon though his intentions are 
good banks constantly distracts himself by any means available to 
avoid the mundane and grownup job 
at one point he emerges from his closet in a tacky vegas 
jumpsuit stuffs it with a pillow and launches into a homage to 
elvis who killed the king of rock n roll banks childlike 
imaginings turn bitingly satiric it wasnt me says lisa marie 
goes one verse i loved my dad and he loved me when i get all 
of his money ill give it to scientology 
banks is also being pressured by his girlfriend phoebe who 
intends to move in with him not only that the landlord is 
complaining about the noise from his drums and promises to toss 
banks out if there is one more drumbeat from his apartment 
so banks grabs up a guitar and gets so involved in his 
impersonation of bob dylan he answers the phone in a nasal 
theres no one here by that name this is the dylan residence 
dylan bob bob yes it is why thank you 
very much 
when lance calls back banks thinks hes being offered the chance 
of a lifetime lances drummer has quit but banks drum audition 
over the phone only succeeds in costing him his apartment hes 
already lost his girlfriend and is on the verge of losing his job 
so he does the only reasonable thing explodes into a punkrock ode 
to his own life 
twentytwo degree twentythree mcdonalds twentyfour 
unemployment twentyfive buttle twentysix buttle twentyseven 
28 29 30 31 32 but now im 33 im tryin to be cool im 
jumping around in my living room 
the song fades as banks realizes thats exactly what hes doing 
and his life is a shambles 
but this is a show with a happy ending even in real life the 
theater audience gives banks a standing ovation and provides an 
authentic banks banks banks

as the capital gains tax law now reads you could 
pay taxes on no gains at all which is just one of the reasons why 
the capital gains issue could become a hot topic of discussion in 
washington this year 
the discussion wouldnt be a new one it has been around for two 
decades and if action isnt taken this year it will be around next 
year too in fact the debate is likely to continue as long as 
inflation exists 
the explanation for this oddity is that the capital gains tax law 
imposes a levy on inflation it causes people to pay taxes on 
imagined income on earnings that never were in some instances 
it might even tax losses 
tempers are flaring supporters of the existing capital gains law 
argue that to lower the rate would be a gift to the rich while 
advocates of change contend that the existing law is a legislated 
snow job 
for this and other reasons president bush seeks to fulfill a 
campaign promise to lower the maximum capital gains tax rate which 
is now at the same 28 percent to 33 percent that applies to ordinary 
income 
and it may be a factor also in causing rep dan rostenkowski 
chairman of the house ways and means committee to consider relaxing 
his strong opposition to a cut 
the existing law makes no provision whatever for inflation 
although inflation has long been a fact of modern life and most 
likely will continue to be in fact only rarely since world war ii 
has it been absent 
consider the predicament of an investor who bought 10000 of 
mutual funds in 1983 and who today still has only 10000 in 
purchasing power after selling his shares the fund did appear to 
grow by 21 percent but so did inflation 
for taxing purposes the taxpayer has earned 2100 to be 
assessed at whatever his or her tax rate might be but in reality 
in terms of dollars equal in purchasing power the investor has 
never made a nickel of profit because the gains did not outpace 
inflation during that period 
it could have been worse the value of the investors shares 
could have dropped to 9000 in real dollar terms but because of 
inflation have given the appearance of having risen to more than 
10000 
already a loser by 1000 in real dollars the investor becomes a 
double loser after paying taxes it is a situation that hardly 
encourages longterm or risky investments in the american economy by 
either rich or poor 
what might be a fair solution indexation has always been 
available to lawmakers but for mysterious reasons it never has been 
used lawmakers like most people may not like to concede that 
inflation is a longterm boarder 
indexation would automatically erase from tax computations any 
gains attributable solely to inflation leaving taxes to be 
assessed only on real earnings as measured by dollars of comparable 
purchasing power 
simply stated tax assessors would use the same measuring stick 
of value for the investment when made and for the investment when 
redeemed for dollars 
as matters stand critics say the calibrations on the measuring 
stick vary from year to year for example whereas a linear foot in 
1983 had 12 inches in 1989 it is declared in effect to have no 
more than 95 inches 
why they say you wouldnt even consider measuring snow that 
way

though churches have condemned homosexual 
activity for centuries gay men and women are beginning to find a 
home within a mainline christian denomination 
the spirit of the lakes ecumenical community church became the 
nations first openly homosexual congregation to join a mainline 
church when it was accepted into membership of the united church of 
christ in april according to its leader 
as far as we know were making history said the rev dan 
geslin pastor of spirit of the lakes we see ourselves as a 
prophetic voice 
we hope that were breaking ground and leading the way for 
other churches and other denominations to open up and recognize gay 
and lesbian peoples rightful place in the church 
spirit of the lakes has grown from 18 people meeting in a living 
room in may 1987 to 150 members it was voted into membership by 
more than 80 percent of the delegates attending the annual meeting 
of the eastern association the largest of the united church of 
christs three associations in minnesota with 71 churches and 24000 
members 
spirit of the lakes is considered a developing church while 
the association reviews the groups constitution and development 
plan those are likely to be approved at the associations 1990 
annual meeting formalizing the congregations admission 
association officials say 
samuel loliger cocoordinator of the united church coalition for 
lesbiangay concerns an athens ohiobased specialinterest group 
within the church said the acceptance of spirit of the lakes is a 
first for mainline denominations 
this one is certainly very different than anything we have 
encountered before he said it is an openly gay and lesbian 
congregation and they have sought to become a church with that 
right up front 
most christian churches accept homosexuals as members equally 
beloved by god as others but condemn the practice of homosexuality 
but the united church of christ a 18millionmember protestant 
church formed in 1957 when the evangelical and reformed church 
merged with the congregational christian churches often has been at 
the forefront of progressive social movements 
in 1969 the churchs general synod approved its first resolution 
supporting civil rights for homosexuals and three years later it 
became the first mainline denomination to ordain an openly gay 
minister 
in 1983 the general synod passed a resolution stating that a 
persons sexual orientation is not a moral issue and that sexual 
orientation should not be the basis for discrimination within the 
church the synod encouraged united church of christ churches to 
openly accept homosexuals as members 
that inclusiveness is what attracted spirit of the lakes to the 
denomination 
geslin 39 who grew up in anoka a minneapolis suburb received 
a master of divinity degree from the pacific school of religion a 
united church of christaffiliated school in berkeley calif he 
took over as pastor of spirit of the lakes in september and 
immediately began pursuing membership in the denomination 
the discussion was why bother to affiliate at all most 
homosexuals look at established churches as oppressive 
institutions geslin said 
but the membership was attracted by the united church of christs 
structure which allows autonomy for each congregation 
this is the best of both worlds for us he said we can 
remain an autonomous congregation and still associate with a 
larger christian body that allows us to be a community of 
gaylesbian christians and at the same time not be ghettoized 
he described the congregation as collegeeducated professionals 
who come from catholic lutheran and episcopal backgrounds and are 
interested in social justice peace liberation and feminist 
theology 
although spirit of the lakes has generally met with quiet 
acceptance some have voiced reservations 
i do not think that any congregation should come in with a 
sexual or a racial orientation said the rev james mccutcheon 
senior minister of the united church of christaffiliated wayzata 
community church i would be bothered if somebody proposed a 
church just for men or a church just for women or a church just 
for married couples and so on 
geslin says 10 percent of his churchs membership is heterosexual 
spirit of the lakes also is bucking christian tradition which 
holds that the practice of homosexuality is a sin 
people who interpret the bible literally point to several old and 
new testament passages that appear to condemn homosexuality one is 
leviticus 2013 which according to the revised standard version 
says if a man lies with a male as with a woman both of them have 
committed an abomination 
but geslin and mccutcheon contend that the bible must be 
interpreted in the context of the time in which it was written 
when leviticus was written geslin said the israelites were 
instinctively concerned with maximizing the probabilities of 
procreation religious laws governing sexual practices reinforced 
that basic tribal concern 
geslin criticizes people who use specific bible verses to condemn 
homosexuals today 
its not taking the bible as a whole he said its picking 
out little bits and pieces to justify cultural prejudices

the countdown has begun at the opera bastille 
some 1500 hard hats are working double shifts putting finishing 
touches on the gleaming glass and steel structure scheduled to open 
july 13 as the french mark the bicentennial of their revolution 
french opera buffs hope the hightech musical complex built on 
the square where revolutionaries stormed the bastille prison on july 
14 1789 will finally put paris on the international music map 
for the moment doubts remain 
the new opera had been leaderless since last january when israeli 
conductor daniel barenboim was fired because of what president 
francois mitterrands representative said were his high fees and 
elitist views on opera 
pierre berge the head of the yves saint laurent fashion empire 
and the man mitterrand appointed to manage the project in its final 
days said barenboims replacement would be someone who understood 
the presidents wish to create a modern and popular opera 
accessible to the masses 
five months of speculation and uncertainty ended last month when 
that someone turned out to be myungwhung chung a 36yearold 
korean conductor known for his skills as a pianist softspoken and 
unemotional the new music director said he would be a team player 
eager to work in harmony and unison with opera bastille 
administrators 
warning he would not get entangled in the political infighting 
that has beset the project from the start he said if there is a 
fight and ill say it publicly right now i wont fight ill just 
leave 
although berge declined to divulge chungs salary he said his 
fiveyear contract requires the maestro be in paris for 27 weeks a 
year for a minimum of 30 performances 
chung also let it be known he has his own ideas on popular 
opera 
popular means the house is full and people are dying to get 
in he said in an interview id like to broaden the operagoing 
public and see more young people and students in the audience 
meanwhile workers are busy getting ready for the inaugural 
concert billed originally as the centerpiece of official 
bicentennial celebrations to be performed before mitterrand 
president george bush and other luminaries 
french conductor georges pretre will conduct the paris opera 
ballet orchestra and chorus with a host of international 
celebrities performing selected arias from wellknown french operas 
the concert will be staged by american director bob wilson the 
longtime darling of the french avantgarde 
the operabastilles first bona fide operatic production is 
scheduled for next february although chung did not reveal the 
program the real star of the show is sure to be the building itself 
the new opera is a hulking mass of polished granite glass and 
stainless steel designed by canadian architect carlos ott critics 
compare it to an ocean liner in dry dock looming over the place de 
la bastille in eastern paris the prison was torn down during the 
revolution 
a technical wonder the opera bastille is everything the ornate 
centuryold paris opera is not the palais garnier may be a landmark 
known worldwide for its baroque design and chagalldecorated 
ceiling but it has been inadequate for decades 
the old opera has a scant 1600 seats with unobstructed views and 
virtually no backstage which meant that sets had to be built 
elsewhere dismantled brought in and reconstructed the cost was 
staggering and so were ticket prices 
tickets to the new opera bastille are expected to cost a maximun 
of 250 francs about 40 less than half their cost at the palais 
garnier which from now on will be devoted to ballet 
the opera bastille has 12 stages in all including a main stage 
flagged by five stages and an adjoining rehearsal stage identical to 
the main stage plus five identical stages one level below 
all are fitted with freight elevators electronically controlled 
and motorized wagons on conveyor tracks so that sets for an entire 
opera can be moved from rehearsal stages to the main stage within 10 
minutes 
michael dittmann the scenic director who drew up the technical 
specifications calls the opera bastille practical not 
sophisticated 
sophisticated means complicated and this building isnt 
complicated he said during a tour of the building its very 
simple its a place where you have a lot of space here we dont 
have the daily problem of where to put our decor in between 
performances 
the main stage offers 4300 square feet of space and is 66 feet 
high it is equipped with 9 elevators 72 traps and a movable 
orchestra pit that can be open or closed in two to three minutes 
a bridge over the main and backstages allows stage hands to load 
the ceiling with carpets curtains and other decor without 
monopolizing the stage the ceiling is also designed for storage 
thus economizing two hours a day when productions alternate 
there is ample space for costumes workshops and storage areas 
connected directly to the main stage the opera bastille is a 
musicians dream with rehearsal rooms galore three for the 
orchestra two for ballet two for the chorus 16 studios for 
singers and 12 for musicians 
while backstage areas are still dusty construction sites the 
main hall itself is nearly ready on a recent visit workmen were 
busy polishing granite pillars washing windows waxing hardwood 
floors and installing cushions 
despite a glass ceiling and a cold color scheme in white black 
and gray the atmosphere is pleasant and intimate aided in part 
to wooden walls and two tiers of graceful balconies reminiscent of 
japanese pagodas 
dittmann says the halls computeranalyzed acoustics are 
excellent even the halls chairs have been designed with acoustics 
in mind there are small holes which allow the sound to pass through 
when they are empty 
a polystyrene joint under the building absorbs vibrations from 
the three metro lines that intersect under the place de la bastille 
if that isnt enough the subway cars themselves will be fitted 
with special rubber tires he said

the huge purchases of us grain by the soviet 
union are welcomed by american farmers and are seen by some analysts 
as proof that the vast agricultural system dictated by kremlin 
policy is inefficient 
whether the soviet agricultural shortcomings are a result of poor 
technology planning climate or other factors are tantalizing 
subjects for debate but some of the facts notably moscows huge 
food imports are unmistakeable 
in the year that began last oct 1 the soviets have bought a 
record of more than 20 million metric tons of us wheat and corn 
mostly the latter not to mention soybeans soybean meal and sorghum 
grain 
in all says usda export analyst steve macdonald american 
farmers will ship a record 34 billion worth of commodities to the 
soviet union this year up from 193 billion in 198788 
soviet agriculture clearly has been unable to keep up with rising 
domestic demand 
some observers have cited the central planning of agricultural 
policy as a principal reason for soviet deficiencies others say 
farmers are not given enough incentives and still others say the 
soviets are technologically inferior in food production 
bob koopman of the departments economic research service notes 
that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in a speech early this 
year called for broad reforms of his nations agriculture 
gorbachev had said that agricultural investment in the ukraine the 
soviet unions bread basket increased by 320 percent over the past 
20 years while production rose by only 39 percent 
koopman writing in the june issue of farmline magazine examined 
the technical efficiency of soviet agriculture roughly a 
measure of output per amount of inputs or the resources used to 
produce crops and livestock 
many western researchers have assumed that soviet agriculture is 
not technically efficient koopman said he is not so certain 
the soviets combine resources differently than we do he 
said for instance they use relatively more labor and less 
machinery than we do but considering the way they use their 
resources they appear to be just as technically efficient as we 
are they seem able to use an older more laborintensive technology 
efficiently 
production costs are higher in the soviet union but given the 
available resources koopman said soviet farmers produce close to 
the maximum level possible 
using a computer model to compare agricultural production 
koopman found that given different combinations of the same 
resources fertilizer labor livestock machinery and land 
regions in the soviet union compared favorably with those in the 
united states canada and finland 
the results dont mean that agricultural production in the soviet 
union is as costeffective as in the other countries koopman said 
its not he said but soviet agriculture generally achieves as 
great an output as possible as great as the nonsoviet areas were 
able to achieve given the resources available to work with 
thus koopman said the ills of soviet agriculture including the 
heavy handedness by planners and the lack of incentives for farmers 
appear to have little impact on technical efficiency when 
compared with the regions studied 
why then is there such stagnation in soviet agriculture 
koopman said the soviet union lacks dynamic efficiency or 
the ability to expand or grow where it counts 
the soviet and nonsoviet systems in the study have nearly 
equal levels of technical efficiency but the nonsoviet areas are 
more effective at growth he said perhaps the reason lies in 
the inability of central planners to facilitate innovation and 
technological change 
koopman added 
soviet farmers are slow at introducing new technology because 
they are in a sense hamstrung by the government 
when farmers need new equipment they have to request it from 
central authorities who may or may not plan to produce such 
equipment in the next fiveyear plan 
if technology everywhere is static and no major improvemnts are 
made soviet farming can be considered technologically efficient 
but as technical changes take place in the west for example soviet 
farmers lag behind 
theyre already using more and more resources and not achieving 
any greater output koopman said they need to encourage more 
flexibility more autonomy more incentives to innovate rather 
than just trying to improve their allocation and use of resources 
just giving incentives to farm workers isnt enough by itself he 
said they must have more freedom to select what they need to 
produce

editors note with the kremlin relaxing stalinera bans on the 
practice of religion dozens of new islamic mosques are opening 
across soviet central asia a land awakening from decades of 
complacent cronyism but no one is sure where more religious freedom 
and other reforms will lead in this volatile region separating the 
heartland of the ussr from iran and afghanistan

soviet central asia an arid land 
historically at the crossroads of caravans and conquerors is being 
buffeted by resurgent islam from the middle east and political 
reforms from moscow 
with new freedoms under president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
residents of the broad band separating the soviet unions slavic 
heartland from iran and afghanistan are expressing their religious 
ethnic and political concerns 
that represents further progress for gorbachev whose program 
already has stirred other areas of the soviet union but it also 
sets the stage for a possible race between secular communist reform 
and revitalized islam for the future of a land awakening from 
decades of complacent cronyism 
much depends on the abilities of new civil and religious leaders 
to persuade people that more freedom can help solve their problems 
and not just offer a vent for their frustration 
such frustration has sparked bloodshed in other southern soviet 
republics armenia azerbaijan and georgia and appears to be 
spreading to central asia severe economic problems led to rioting 
in two cities of the turkmen republic bordering iran in may a 
rampage of arson and murder between ethnic groups in eastern 
uzbekistan in the past week killed scores of people 
but ultimate success in the region is vital to the kremlin faced 
across its southern frontier with irans islamic fundamentalism and 
afghan rebels who fought the soviet army to a standstill both 
inspire some radicals 
in an interview after being chosen the new spiritual leader of 
central asias moslems recently 36yearold mohammadsadyk 
mamayusupov indicated he would follow previous religious leaders in 
cooperating with the government but use the reforms broadly to 
improve religious life 
we intend to use this moment very judiciously for the 
development of our religion and the renewal of its spiritual life 
he says 
mamayusupov has moved quickly where he can between feb 6 and 
midmarch authorities gave permission for the opening of about 35 
new mosques and he pledged that we will continue to open mosques 
until all the requests of our moslems are satisfied 
only about 200 mosques are sprinkled across the five central 
asian republics kazakhstan uzbekistan kirghizia turkmenia and 
tadzhikistan which occupy an area half the size of the continental 
united states 
the number of students in islamic academies is being doubled and 
the number of korans and other religious books being published will 
be greatly increased the kremlin is removing a stalinera ban on 
group religious education and plans to allow believers to organize 
charities 
but radicals predict the increased attention to religious needs 
will lead more people to embrace islamic fundamentalism 
we need to raise the people up said one moslem radical who 
favors establishment of an iranianstyle islamic republic it 
wont be in two three or four years it has to be done very 
quietly he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the stakes are considerable the population of the five central 
asian republics is booming from 1970 to 1987 it increased 26 
percent to 475 million and now makes up about 18 percent of the 
soviet population 
at the center of much of the regions activity is uzbekistan and 
its capital tashkent the historic cities of bukhara and samarkand 
along the silk route are centers of religious culture 
what is now soviet central asia accepted islam in the first 
century after mohammed and was a crossroads for mongols turks 
persians and slavs until it was absorbed in czarist russias drive 
south in the 19th century 
although officially atheist the soviet union nevertheless has 
maintained relations with iran and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze held a rare meeting with ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
last winter 
the soviet union has supported arab causes in the middle east 
diplomatically and militarily for more than two decades but now is 
trying to improve relations with israel in order to play a bigger 
role in any middle east peace settlement 
mamayusupov rector of the higher islamic institute in tashkent 
owes his selection in part to the resurgence of religious feelings 
in early february mufti shamsuddinkhan babakhan was ousted by a 
series of protests in which radicals accused him of corruption and 
lacking sufficient religious knowledge a council of religious 
leaders elected mamayusupov to replace him

six weeks after ousting babakhan believers were demonstrating 
again but this time they were praising god for the return of a 
7thcentury koran a gift from the uzbekistan government 
there also have been protests that have taken on a more political 
or ethnic character reflecting other influences 
ethnic resentment between uzbekis and meskhi turks who were 
forcibly resettled to eastern uzbekistans fergana valley by stalin 
in 1944 exploded in early june scores of people died and hundreds 
of houses were torched thousands of meskhis were evacuated to 
protect them but even then the 9000 interior ministry soldiers 
sent in had difficulty keeping order 
bands of young people frustrated with high prices and consumer 
shortages rioted in two cities of the turkmen republic bordering 
iran at the beginning of may 
on april 9 tashkent sources said several thousand people 
rallied to support belik an informal political group seeking to 
establish uzbek as the republics official language and calling for 
drastic measures to improve the environment belik means unity 
in the uzbek language 
in central asia as in the baltic republics and armenia the 
deteriorating environment has become a rallying point that has 
opened up broader issues such as economic reform and demands for 
more local control 
gafkha namatova a belik spokeswoman said the group claims 
100000 members it supports gorbachevs reforms she said but we 
see a lot that we like in the programs of the peoples front 
grassroots organizations that have sprung up in the baltics and 
elsewhere 
national policies demanding cotton production in central asia 
have led to food shortages she said abuse of farm chemicals on 
those same cotton fields has increased infant mortality she charged 
in an interview with the soviet government newspaper izvestia in 
march the republics new president mirzaolim izragimov said 
cottongrowing must be deemphasized 
the policy of pushing marginal land into production ruined 173 
million acres of pasture he said 
drainage of rivers that flow into the aral sea on the border of 
uzbekistan and kazakhstan has lowered the level of the sea and made 
it one of the soviet unions top environmental concerns 
many of the policies and practices now being repudiated in 
central asia are associated with former president leonid i brezhnev 
and his supporters 
but experience has shown the danger of replacing local officials 
ignoring ethnic feelings 
in 1986 riots broke out in alma ata the capital of kazakhstan 
following the replacement of the republics party leader dinmukhamed 
kunaev by gennady kolbin kunaev an ethnic kazakh was a politburo 
member and a close associate of brezhnev kolbin is a russian 
brezhnevs soninlaw yuri churbanov was sentenced to 12 years 
in a labor camp last december after being convicted of accepting 
more than 145000 from uzbekistan officials 
mamayusupov pledged religious leaders would become more socially 
active fighting bribery alcoholism and prostitution 
attacks on those social ills are not likely to bring him into 
conflict with the kremlin but moslem leaders could run into 
difficulty with local authorities if they launch a serious 
anticorruption campaign 
moslems intend to struggle very actively in the social 
sphere he said adding that ecology is the first target 
while some civil discontent is organized openly through belik and 
similar organizations the religious discontent remains largely 
hidden 
an underground group calling itself islam and democracy claimed 
credit for the protests that ousted babakhan but it since has 
splintered 
almaz estekov the 33yearold chairman preaches the need for a 
strengthening of islam as well as establishment of westernstyle 
civil liberties 
but he said islam and democracy ultimately cannot cooperate with 
belik because of the latters secular views 
the influence of khomeinis iran may be limited the vast 
majority of soviet moslems are sunnis while shiites are dominant in 
iran the two sects have deep historic differences 
mamayusupov said the traditions of soviet moslems are strong 
enough that they will not be carried away by attempts to export a 
radical islamic movement from iran or afghanistan 
we have our own view and our own foundation he says we 
can influence others but others cannot influence us

on the stage of the eighth van cliburn 
international piano competition 12 pianists try to survive the last 
performances of the semifinals 
they sweat and smile nervously between pieces as tension fills 
the auditorium at texas christian university where a winner will be 
announced on sunday june 11 but the question whispered 
seattoseat is where is van cliburn 
the 54yearold pianist and namesake of the quadrennial piano 
competition has taken on the aura of mystery man in the world of 
classical music since at the age of 23 he stunned the world by 
winning the prestigious international tchaikovsky competition in the 
soviet union 
his retirement from public performances in 1977 and his plans to 
return to the concert stage later this month have only increased 
curiosity about the pianist who says he doesnt want the world of 
music to take him too far from the other things he holds dear 
i want to have a balance so that i can see my friends the 
public and also be able to have home life he said in an 
interview i must say im such a texan being able to have 
blackeyed peas and corn bread and turnip greens is just terribly 
wonderful 
it was 1958 the height of the cold war when his tchaikovsky 
victory in moscow catapulted cliburn to international celebrity 
status he was the first american ever to win the coveted prize and 
he won by playing the explosive and romantic piano concerto no 1 
his reception back home in the states was akin that to that 
granted olympians new york city gave him a ticker tape parade the 
citys first for a musician and his concert schedule ballooned to 
100 dates a season 
today cliburn is incredulous when he looks back on that time 
somebody would say how many did you play and id say oh 
sometimes i dont want to count 
in 1977 cliburn said enough and stopped accepting concert 
dates while many thought his rest would be short his hiatus 
stretched to 10 years when he performed at the white house for 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and his wife he plans to return to 
the concert stage june 19 in a benefit performance of the liszt 
piano concerto no 1 and the tchaikovsky piano concerto no 1 with 
the philadelphia orchestra 
some of his recordings have been rereleased on compact disc and 
new recordings are planned cliburn however doesnt plan to allow 
the second stage of his career grow as hectic as the first 
i love people and i love to meet them and all that but i love 
home life and being able to be at home that has been such a joy 
for me he said 
home since 1987 has been a house overlooking fort worth where 
he lives with his mother and first piano teacher 92yearold rildia 
bee cliburn cliburn was born in shreveport la but spent his 
boyhood in the east texas town of kilgore 
he began playing piano when he was 3 years old and made his 
orchestral debut with the houston symphony when he was 12 the 
following year he performed at carnegie hall made his new york 
philharmonic debut at 19 and went to moscow at 23 
but cliburn never retired from the social scene frequenting 
favorite operas restaurants and new york social events even while 
his career was on hold and the social whirl is never more frenzied 
than during the competition founded in 1962 to bring an 
international piano contest to texas and honor cliburn this year it 
began may 27 with 38 competitors 
the event has a budget of more than 25 million and draws 
competitors from around the world cliburn sees its jury process 
which winnows a field of 38 competitors down to six finalists then 
a winner as a way of divining an opportunity cycle for young 
artists 
the competitors careers he believes will hinge on their 
ability to communicate music what he calls great pages of 
literature to the audience and during the competition to the 
jurors 
this is a performers competition and a performer is a 
servant he serves the composer and he serves the audience 
cliburn said in my own case im a very good audience i always 
say that i am because i go to hear someone because i enjoy being a 
member of an audience and i get very excited if someone speaks to 
me 
cliburn makes no choices in his own mind as he listens to the 
performers instead envisioning each in his or her career 
a crowd favorite entering the final round is 19yearold aleksei 
sultanov of the soviet union the youngest competitor this year 
whose appeal appears to rest in his individualistic style and boyish 
charm during the semifinals sultanov brought more than half the 
audience to its feet with a rousing finale of chopins sonata no 3 
in b minor 
audience members were again standing after the final recital of 
the semifinals by benedetto lupo of italy who concluded with 
rachmaninoffs sonata no 2 in bflat minor lupo 25 also reached 
the finals 
other finalists are elisso bolkvadze 22 and alexander 
shtarkman 22 both of the soviet union jose carlos cocarelli 30 
of brazil and ying tian 20 of china shtarkmans father naum 
took third place to cliburns first in the 1958 tchaikovsky 
cliburn said that while he doesnt plan to repeat the whirlwind 
of performances that followed that tchaikovsky some aspects of a 
concert career never change one case in point music critics 
ive lived through all of that before so i mean that will be 
not new he said 
nevertheless he is fearful as he plans his return to a concert 
schedule its the same emotion he recalls experiencing every time 
he went on stage 
one of the things that you always feel as a performer at 
least i always felt i always wanted so to do my best if i didnt 
do my best i would be the person that would be hurt the most and 
disappointed the most he said 
so every time i go on stage you just remember ill be 
certainly wanting to do my best

tom jackson owner of a small electronics 
business in texas always dreamed of a vacation hideaway where he 
and his family could play tennis or stroll on the beach any time 
they wanted 
but the 45yearold corpus christi man couldnt afford to do more 
than look until the developers of a nearby padre island condominum 
slashed the price of their units by at least 40 percent 
he and wife kay recently snapped up a buy of a lifetime 
twobedroom oceanfront condo for 113000 and received easy 
financing 
the only thing i regret is that i didnt buy a threebedroom 
condo instead jackson said 
a number of equally anxious vacationers wont just be sunbathing 
at the beach fishing the lakes and hiking the woods this summer 
theyre also likely to do some serious sightseeing in the local 
housing market 
despite an overall slump in the property business nationwide 
real estate experts say this season is turning out to be a hot one 
for many buyers 
many parts of the country offer bargain prices due to the fallout 
from recent taxreform changes overbuilding regional economic 
downturns and declining interest rates experts say 
if i was in the market for a second home i would consider 
now a good time to buy said tom franks a senior vice president 
for the american resort amp residential development association a 
washingtonbased trade group there are a lot of good values out 
there 
although bargains can be had in just about any state if you look 
hard enough the market for the nations 55 million vacation homes 
varies by region just as with vacation spots 
some of the standouts this year franks and other experts say 
include properties located in parts of florida the rockies the 
texas gulf coast hilton head island sc palm springs calif 
and parts of new england 
condominiums in particular carry big price cuts experts say 
units in the low to mediumprice range which were eagerly snapped 
up by investors during the inflationary 1970s and early 1980s are 
being unloaded because the tax reform act of 1986 eliminated most of 
the tax incentives on second homes particularly for those who rent 
out their properties 
theres more demand this year for detached homes little less 
demand in condos thats where i think one can do quite well said 
gary dionne an agent with era byse realtors a laconia nh 
broker that sells vacation homes in resort areas like lake 
winnipesaukee 
he said vacation homes prices in general have flattened out in 
new hampshire this year after skyrocketing two years ago prices 
range from around 75000 to 500000 
condo prices on hilton head island sc have declined by about 
40 percent overall from the mid1980s although oceanfront property 
hasnt been hurt as much according to local broker juliana toon 
pawley of coldwell banker amp co 
for as little as 25000 bargain hunters can pick up a modest 
twobedroom modular unit on the atlantic about a quarter of what 
they sold for five years ago mrs pawley said more upscale 
oceanfront condos usually start at around 120000 she said 
further south in the northern portion of padre island texas 
where jackson the corpus christi electrician bought his vacation 
home waterfront units that sold for 200000 three years ago now go 
for around 120000 said one developer jack ponton of nisbet 
ponton corp 
its probably below cost ponton said but added that prices 
are starting to rebound a bit from last year as the oildriven texas 
economy improves 
out west older homes and condos in the rockies also have been 
especially hit hard experts say 
los angeles accountant stan ross said the threebedroom house he 
bought in the popular ski resort area of park city utah would 
probably fetch the same price he bought it at seven years ago 
around 120000 
but ross is taking the market downturn in stride he said he 
bought his vacation home as an easy getaway to enjoy and relax 
rather than as an alternative to the financial markets 
experts agree that prospective buyers should consider more than 
just price when looking for a second home 
what good is owning an inexpensive cabin across the country for 
instance if it costs a fortune to get there 
most middleincome buyers should look at some place that can be 
reached within a days drive said franks you shouldnt buy 
something that doesnt have demand 
its kind of like anything in life a bargain is not a bargain 
unless its something you want said franks 
john diamond senior vice president for real estate research 
corp in chicago said buyers should do some careful research before 
reaching any decision like tracking local economic trends or making 
sure the area in which they plan to buy isnt being overbuilt 
its also important to get a handle on local property taxes 
you want to make sure it is a vacation home said diamond 
some people are shocked when they thought they bought a vacation 
home and found themselves faced with the high cost of providing 
schools and infrastructure in the far out suburbs

saudi aramco saudi arabias 
oilproducing firm says it struck a large well that could yield 
8000 barrels a day of crude oil 
the company which operates the worlds largest oil field in a 
country with the worlds largest reserves said wednesday the find 
was made in the hawtah region in central saudi arabia about 120 
miles south of the capital riyadh 
saudi aramco said preliminary tests indicated the well could 
yield 8000 barrels a day of light crude containing only 006 
percent sulphur 
sadad i husseini saudi aramcos vice president for exploration 
and production said the find confirms the potential for 
substantial discoveries in rock formations recently studied by 
saudi aramco and assessed to be highly prospective 
oil industry executives and company sources reported the strike 
tuesday but they said it was made in the nearby khurais region and 
gave no details 
the find was made as part of a major exploration program launched 
by saudi aramco in 1986 after the saudi government expanded the 
companys exploration concession 
it was the first strike since aramco was restructured in late 
1988 and the first in a promising area only recently identifed most 
of the companys oil field is located in the east part of the 
country 
saudi aramco announced earlier this year that its proven reserves 
have gone up from 169 billion to 252 billion barrels and could 
reach 315 billion barrels 
the company has discovered 52 oil fields and one commercial gas 
field since it started exploration 55 years ago 
under its current organization of petroleum exporting countries 
quota saudi arabia exports 4524 million barrels a day but in the 
oil boom years output peaked at more than 11 million barrels a day

than forecast with early signs of an 114 percent increase on the 
current seasons droughthit yield according to the international

the council one of the foremost grain forecasting bodies now 
puts world wheat output between july 1989 to june 1990 at 533

production of coarse grains principally maize rye oats 
barley and sorghum is now forecast at 840 million tons against 830 
million previously and 728 million this season the council said 
wednesday 
the rise is attributed to improved prospects for the soviet union 
and the united states with forecasts of 112 million tons for the 
soviets up from with 976 million in 198889 and 240 million for 
the us compared with 1496 million

million against 936 million this season and the european community 
at 90 million compared with 893 million 
the indian harvest however is expected to fall 26 million tons

brackets include 
soviet union 900 million 845 million china 89 million 87 
million the eec 867 million 853 million the united states 
565 million 493 million and india 50 million 451 million 
the councils first forecast of 198990 world coarse grain trade 
is down eight million tons at 93 million reflecting the prospect of 
lower soviet imports which could drop by 9 million to 16 million

time inc shareholders are faced with two deals 
involving their publishing and cable company a merger with warner 
communications inc and a tender offer from paramount communications

here is a capsule description on what is being proposed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
time and warner have agreed on a merger that involves an exchange 
of stock to create a company that would be the worlds largest media 
and entertainment concern 
under that plan time shareholders would get one share in the new 
company for each share of time stock they own warner shareholders 
would get 0465 shares of stock in the new company for each warner 
share they hold 
the arrangement would leave time shareholders with roughly 40 
percent of the new company and warner shareholders with the rest

media and entertainment companies were in the 
spotlight on wall street as news of paramount communications incs 
107 billion bid for time inc revived speculation about possible 
bids for other communications concerns 
the stocks of several big media firms rose sharply wednesday on 
the new york stock exchange mca inc rose 187 to close at 
5662 cbs inc surged 475 to 20562 capital citiesabc 
picked up 750 to 468 and warner communications inc whose 
planned merger with time was cast into doubt by the paramount bid 
rose 175 to 5350 
wednesdays advances were similar to gains chalked up earlier 
this year when time and warner announced plans to merge and form the 
worlds largest media concern 
news of a big takeover bid for a company often sparks interest in 
other firms in that industry but the activity in media and 
entertainment stocks has had an added twist recently 
the media information and entertainment industries have 
undergone a wave of consolidations in recent years with large 
companies snapping up other firms to create media giants 
the buyers mainly have been foreign publishing and broadcasting 
giants such as rupert murdochs news corp and maxwell communication 
corp and electronics behemoth sony corp these companies have 
scooped up us media concerns in a torrent of deals made possible 
in recent years by their own wealth and the weak us dollar 
the growth of media conglomerates was uppermost in the minds of 
time executives as they negotiated their agreement with warner 
martin s davis paramounts chairman apparently wants to be 
part of the trend if he succeeds in acquiring time his own 
entertainment and publishing conglomerate would have a projected 7 
billion in sales 
a timewarner combination would have projected revenue of more 
than 10 billion 
paramount which changed its name from gulf amp western inc on 
monday owns paramount pictures and television simon amp schuster and 
prentice hall publishers and a number of other broadcasting 
entertainment and publishing businesses

a spokesman for the air lines pilots association 
says a federal appeals court ruling means eastern airlines attempt 
to expand its limited service may be stalled 
but eastern spokesman jim ashlock declined to comment on how the 
ruling wednesday by the 11th us circuit court of appeals would 
affect plans for easterns reorganization 
a threejudge panel of the appeals court upheld a lower court 
ruling denying easterns request for an injunction against the 
pilots union to stop the strike 
ashlock said the miamibased airline has no plans to appeal the 
case further 
in another setback for eastern the justice department said 
wednesday it plans to file an antitrust suit blocking easterns 
proposed sale to usair group inc of its airport gates in 
philadelphia and its philadelphiatoronto route 
the justice department said the 85 million proposal threatens 
to lessen competition in airline service between philadelphia and 
other cities said michael boudin acting antitrust chief for the 
department 
the appeals court ruling was prompted by a lawsuit eastern filed 
in us district court after most of the airlines 3600 pilots 
honored picket lines set up by members of the machinists union when 
it went on strike march 4 
the walkout also supported by eastern flight attendants 
virtually grounded the carrier and compelled it to seek bankruptcy 
protection from creditors march 9 
kenny thomas a communications specialist with the air lines 
pilots association said the ruling reaffirms the pilots 
solidarity in dealing with texas air corp chairman frank 
lorenzo 
he also said the ruling strengthens the unions backing of 
chicago commodities trader joseph ritchie who is trying to buy the 
carrier from texas air easterns parent company 
thomas said that in light of the ruling officials for ritchie 
will meet with us bankruptcy court officials in washington to 
discuss the proposed buyout again 
easterns creditors have rejected ritchies proposal 
chuck kilian a striking eastern pilot in atlanta said the 
ruling was not a surprise but was a morale booster 
as time moves along we get more and more little victories 
he said this is a good victory at a good time it gives us that 
much more resolve and enthusiasm 
thomas said the ruling means lorenzo will not have enough pilots 
to carry through lorenzos plan to rebuild the airline as a smaller 
carrier and sell about 18 billion of its assets 
eastern said wednesday it is negotiating to sell its south 
american routes possibly to rival american airlines 
we have talked to american ashlock said from miami 
he said eastern also has held talks on the routes with other 
airlines 
ashlock declined to identify the other carriers interested in the 
south american network which served 10 cities before eastern was 
struck or to disclose easterns asking price 
wall street analysts have estimated the value of the network at 
about 150 million 
any sale of eastern assets must be approved by a federal 
bankruptcy court judge in new york the judge recently approved the 
sale of easterns northeast shuttle to developer donald trump for 
365 million 
american spokesman ed stewart acknowledged americans general 
interest in eastern assets but would not confirm that talks had been 
held on the south american routes 
were looking at things that might be for sale stewart said 
from americans fort worth texas headquarters 
for american the nations largest airline the south american 
routes would bolster its strategy to expand overseas american 
recently added new flights to western europe and has expressed 
interest in easterns caribbean routes 
before the walkout eastern served caracas venezuela asuncion 
paraguay barranquilla and cali colombia buenos aires argentina 
guayaquil and quito ecuador lima peru la paz bolivia and

shortages of staff and spare parts could be 
hampering strikebound eastern airlines ability to properly maintain 
its fleet the head of a congressional panel has told the federal 
aviation administration 
rep cardiss collins dill chairwoman of the government 
activities and transportation subcommittee of the house committee on 
government operations expressed the concern in a letter to acting 
faa administrator robert e whittington 
while it is clear eastern has suffered staffing problems because 
of the 3monthold walkout by machinists union members pilots and 
flight attendants collins letter raised the question of whether 
the few planes still flying are receiving proper care 
the faa recently concluded a special investigation of maintenance 
at easterns facilities at its miami base and at atlanta but has 
not disclosed its findings 
the transportation subcommittees staff has reviewed internal 
company documents indicating that manpower and parts shortages 
continue to plague the maintenance function of eastern collins 
wrote the faa chief last thursday a copy of the letter was obtained 
by the associated press 
the impact of maintenance on airline safety has been highlighted 
by several accidents in one case the national transportation 
safety board largely blamed aloha airlines maintenance program for 
failing to detect fatigue damage to the fuselage of a 19yearold 
boeing 737 that split open over hawaii killing a flight attendant 
collins said easterns maintenance shortcomings appear to persist 
despite several faa investigations of the carrier and 
substantial fines against the airline as well as commitments by 
management to correct the problems 
whittington hasnt yet responded to collins letter faa 
spokesman fred farrar said wednesday he said the special 
investigation was completed on may 12 but the report on it hasnt 
yet been submitted to the faa chief 
everything they eastern do is being watched farrar said 
were going to keep a very close eye on eastern until the strike 
is over 
eastern spokesman jim ashlock said he couldnt comment on 
collins letter because he wasnt familiar with the documents to 
which she referred 
eastern is under the most intensive scrutiny that any airlines 
ever been subjected to he said adding that the adequacy of its 
manpower and parts could easily be checked 
early last month eastern temporarily surrendered its repair 
station certificate at new yorks john f kennedy international 
airport after the faa determined the carrier had failed to follow 
its system for recording and inspecting maintenance work 
the suspension was for actions that predated the march 4 start of 
the strike which pushed eastern into bankruptcy court five days 
later 
soon after the jfk certificate was pulled the faa sent nine 
inspectors to easterns main base in miami to determine if 
violations of maintenance recordkeeping rules such as those found 
in new york existed in miami and atlanta 
jfk miami international and atlantas hartsfield international 
are the sites of easterns three principal maintenance facilities 
if the faa ordered eastern to temporarily relinquish its 
certificates for the miami and atlanta facilities that could 
severely hamper the airlines ability to operate 
when a maintenance certificate is suspended the airline is 
prohibited from doing work at the facility until deficiencies are 
corrected the work must be contracted out or planes needing 
repairs must be ferried elsewhere 
in her letter collins called easterns surrendering of its jfk 
certificate unprecedented 
i am concerned that this may not be an isolated case and may 
be in fact an indication of systemic problems throughout easterns 
maintenance department the lawmaker told whittington she asked 
him to advise her of the results of the latest investigation as soon 
as possible 
collins subcommittee previously held hearings on maintenance 
practices at eastern and their potential impact on passenger safety 
she has expressed concern about easterns decision to continue some 
operations during the strike 
the airline has faced a number of faa investigations in recent 
years including one in 1986 that resulted in a 95 million fine 
for safety infractions and a threatened suspension of easterns 
overall operating license 
easterns unions contend the maintenance problems are systemwide 
and endanger safety they accuse supervisors of pencilwhipping 
or signing their names to documents on aircraft repairs that werent 
made 
the unions also charge that management in an effort to cut costs 
and maintain flying schedules has bullied mechanics and pilots who 
complain about serious maintenance violations 
eastern countercharges that some machinists hid or destroyed 
maintenance records at jfk and then told the faa that company 
supervisors neglected to have necessary work performed company 
representatives discovered records hidden in file cabinets and 
stuffed under sofa cushions in union areas at the airport said 
eastern spokesman robin matell 
weve never dispatched an unsafe plane we have one of the best 
safety records in the industry matell said he called union 
complaints a deliberate attempt to drive away our passengers and 
weaken the company

the united states spent more than 2 billion to 
temper the dollars rise in foreign exchange last winter as higher 
interest rates and political uncertainty abroad bolstered the value 
of the currency a federal reserve report shows 
the latest quarterly foreignexchange report issued wednesday by 
the federal reserve bank of new york showed the fed and the treasury 
sold 214 billion for the equivalent west german marks and japanese 
yen during the three months ended april 30 
the dollar sales which were mostly for marks were the largest 
since the 293 billion sold during the mayjuly 1988 period the 
fed said 
in the previous novemberjanuary quarter the united states 
bought 24 billion against the mark and yen then sold 188 
billion against marks as market sentiment turned more bullish for 
the dollar 
sam y cross an executive vice president of the new york fed 
said the latest operations were designed to maintain market 
stability and generally were coordinated with the central banks of 
the group of seven industrial nations besides the united 
states the g7 includes japan britain west germany france italy 
and canada 
cross said that some of the governments intervention operations 
were done jointly with other central banks but at other times the 
united states acted alone after notifying its trading partners 
currency traders are often keenly aware of the activities of 
central banks in the open markets but the feds policy is to 
comment only well after the fact the fed also does not provide any 
data on intervention by foreign central banks 
the governments dollarselling operations during the 
februaryapril period came amid strong foreign demand for the us 
currency 
us shortterm interest rates were comparatively higher than 
those abroad as a result of inflationfighting efforts by the fed 
that made dollardenominated assets more attractive to foreigners 
thereby increasing the need to convert to dollars 
political developments abroad also weighed against several major 
foreign currencies 
in japan an insidertrading scandal brought the government of 
prime minister takeshita under increasing pressure while in west 
germany the imposition and subsequent removal of a controversial 
withholding tax on interest income brought considerable confusion to 
the market 
intervention involving marks took place from feb 2 to feb 6 
when the government sold 350 million according to the fed report 
the government also entered the market between march 8 and march 30 
when it sold 1419 billion on april 10 and april 11 when it sold 
170 million and on april 30 when it sold 50 million the report 
said 
sales of dollars for yen were made during the march 830 period 
amounting to 100 million and on april 30 amounting to 50 
million it said 
during the februaryapril period the dollar reached a high of 
19025 marks and 13350 yen the dollar has risen even further 
lately trading around 198 marks and 142 yen 
the dollar reached its highest point of the decade in february 
1985 it declined slightly until september 1985 when g7 leaders 
agreed to lower its value to help narrow the us trade gap and 
stave off protectionist sentiment in congress 
the dollar touched bottom in the final days of 1987 before 
rebounding sharply at the beginning of 1988

americans took out 273 billion more in 
consumer debt than they retired in april a sharp slowing of the 
borrowing pace of earlier months the government reported 
the federal reserve board said wednesday that consumer credit in 
april rose 47 percent on a seasonally adjusted annual rate down 
from 64 percent in march and 95 percent in february 
aprils increase was the slowest advance since a 35 percent gain 
last september and was a sharp retreat from the 85 percent rise in 
consumer debt during all of 1988 
the report also reflected a sharp downward revision in the level 
of consumer borrowing in march which originally was estimated to 
have grown at a 94 percent annual rate 
economist sandra shaber of the futures group in washington said 
the report was consistent with a host of other signs that economic 
growth is slowing as the record peacetime expansion extends into its 
seventh year 
weve been seeing for a very long time a great deal of caution 
in consumer borrowing to the point that debt outstanding is 
begininng to fall behind the growth in personal income ms shaber 
said 
that americans have kept their borrowing under control so far 
this year could bode well for healthy consumer spending as the year 
progresses she said 
consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of the 
economys health because it represents twothirds of overall 
economic activity 
aprils slowdown in borrowing occurred even though automobile 
loans increased at a 31 percent annual rate rising by 752 
million after declining by 01 percent in march 
auto sales which have been weak so far this year picked up 
somewhat in april as carmakers launched a new round of incentives to 
lure shoppers back into showrooms 
the economy has been slowing in recent months in response to a 
15month campaign by the federal reserve to fight inflation by 
pushing up interest rates and restraining economic growth signs 
emerged this week that the fed has begun to ease its grip on the 
money supply 
aprils consumer credit report revealed a sharp falloff in 
borrowing in the category of debt that includes credit cards 
revolving credit increased by 177 billion in april an 116 
percent annual rate of growth compared with a 272 percent spurt in 
march 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate increased 
by 392 million in april a 24 percent annual rate of advance down 
from a 93 percent rate of growth in march 
the various changes left total consumer debt in april at a 
seasonally adjusted 69382 billion

tw which had repeatedly rejected conistons advances and tried 
to thwart the investor group with a variety of defenses said 
wednesday it had accepted the partnerships sweetened 165 billion 
offer 
i think that in the end they realized we were determined to buy 
the company or at least determined to see it the takeover battle 
to the end said augustus oliver a coniston principal 
the 34pershare agreement marks the latest victory for 
coniston which has reaped big profits by acquiring stakes in 
companies mounting or threatening to mount a takeover bid and later 
selling its shares back to the company or a rival bidder 
tw stock rose 25 cents a share to 33 in new york stock exchange 
composite trading wednesday 
management of tw services whose holdings include thousands of 
dennys and hardees restaurants was reticent about the deal 
which suggested their decision to accept conistons latest offer was 
a reluctant one 
the only comment is that management and their directors have 
worked hard to bring shareholders value and feel that shareholders 
are getting a fair price for our stock said james ryan a tw 
spokesman 
coniston also said it planned to replace tw chairman and chief 
executive officer frank salizzoni oliver said jerome richardson 
now tws president was expected to become the new chief executive 
salizzoni was not in his office wednesday when a reporter called 
for comment 
oliver said coniston would retain the 1220restaurant dennys 
chain spartan food systems inc the largest franchisee of hardees 
fastfood restaurants and canteen which provides food services to 
such corporations and clients as the national park service and 
yankee stadium 
however oliver said in a telephone interview american medical 
services tws nursing home business and other minor divisions 
would be sold 
under the sweetened offer scheduled to expire july 5 coniston 
affiliate swt associates lp will pay 34 in cash for 61 percent of 
tws 485 million outstanding shares 
that would give coniston which owns 19 percent of tws stock 80 
percent of the companys shares after the offer expires holders of 
the remaining 20 percent of tw stock would be given the choice of 
receiving 34 in cash or 30 and one share of stock in the 
surviving company 
coniston had offered 29 a share or about 14 billion for tw 
oliver said coniston had financing commitments from citibank and 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp to complete the tender 
offer 
coniston first approached tw last september tw consistently 
rejected the bid as inadequate and said it would deploy its poison 
pill takeover defense against coniston 
poison pills drive up the cost of hostile takeovers by allowing 
target companies to issue additional stock 
coniston sought unsuccessfully to have the pill invalidated by 
state courts in delaware where tw is incorporated 
coniston also planned to wage a proxy fight to elect three 
candidates to tws 11member board a move the company attempted to 
thwart by postponing its annual meeting 
despite the obstacles thrown up by tw coniston refused to back 
down 
on tuesday tw said its board was reviewing proposals to buy the 
company or its units ryan the tw spokesman said the board would 
not reveal who the other bidders may have been or the amount of 
their offers 
tw had earnings of 669 million in 1988 on revenue of 36 
billion 
coniston failed to win a proxy fight to force a sale of gillette 
co last year although the company later agreed to a stock buyback 
in 1987 the firm helped force the restructuring of allegis corp 
which was renamed ual inc by acquiring a large stake and 
threatening to mount a takeover

the chairman of the house ways and means 
committee said he would consider accepting lower capital gains tax 
rates as a revenueraising measure 
i havent seen a way to raise revenue in the next fiscal year 
without a capital gains rate cut rep dan rostenkowski dill 
told the new york times in an interview published today 
he said that with president bushs opposition to new taxes the 
only thing that seems negotiable is capital gains 
rostenkowski has long opposed bushs proposal to reduce the 
capital gains rate currently the same as the income tax rate on 
ordinary income to 15 percent 
in washington a committee aide who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said wednesday night that rostenkowski had not changed his 
opposition to a reduction 
but in an interview published today in the wall street journal 
rostenkowski said let the process begin everything is on the 
table 
rostenskowski recognizes that bush who campaigned on a slogan of 
read my lips no new taxes and a majority of committee 
republicans are going to have to accept any revenue compromise the 
aide said 
proponents of capital gains reduction have a real leg up in 
such a situation the aide said because of the recognition on all 
sides that any change up or down in capital gains rates yields a 
revenue increase in the first year 
capital gains are the increases in value of any assets such as 
stocks a tax rate increase captures a bigger slice of the proceeds 
of asset sales that would be made in any case a rate decrease 
stimulates more sales and brings in more government revenue that way 
economists disagree over what happens after the first year bush 
argues that there are permanently more transactions with lower rates 
than they would otherwise be rostenkowski and others argue that 
this is not so and people selling stock would get an unjustified tax 
break 
additionally opponents of lower rates say that stock trading is 
done by people of high incomes and benefits of those rates are not 
available to those living on modest salaries 
the ways and means committee is under instructions from the 
budget committee to come up with an additional 53 billion in 
revenue for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 the joint taxation 
committee estimated that a cut in rates to 15 percent as proposed by 
bush would yield 35 billion in the first year though it would 
reduce revenue after that the office of management and budget 
estimated the firstyear gain at 42 billion 
though often in recent years capital gains have been taxed a 
separately stated rates currently gains are treated like all other 
income the top current federal income tax rate is 33 percent

the rancho seco nuclear power plant has 
ceased producing electricity amid predictions from public interest 
groups that the shutdown called for by voters would inspire similar 
actions across the nation 
operators began shutting down the plant wednesday after voters 
became the first in the nation to say that a working reactor should 
be closed 
the vote was not binding on the sacramento municipal utility 
district which owns the problemplagued 15yearold plant but a 
majority of its five elected board members had promised to abide by 
the will of the people 
the plant stopped producing electricity wednesday morning but 
the process of shutting down the reactor in the 913megawatt plant 
was expected to be take up to 72 hours said rancho seco spokeswoman 
karen wilson 
the utility district said mothballing or dismantling the plant 
will take several years and could cost more than 300 million 
basically we will be plowing new ground said jim shetler 
rancho seco assistant manager total decommissioning has not been 
done on this level before and we wont have a lot to draw on 
critics claimed the plant 25 miles southeast of sacramento was 
unsafe and had a poor operating record tuesdays vote was 111867 
or 534 percent against continued operation and 97460 or 466 
percent for continued operation 
it will be essentially a shot heard around the world citizens 
are going to know they can take on city hall and win said scott 
denman director of the safe energy communication council a 
washingtonbased coalition of environmental and public interest 
organizations against nuclear power 
public citizen a group formed in 1971 by ralph nader said in a 
statement that the vote marks the beginning of the end for nuclear 
power in the united states americas love affair with the atom 
is over

potential brake or rear suspension problems 
prompted ford motor co to recall about 119000 of its mercury 
cougar and ford thunderbird cars including the winner of a 
magazines prestigious car of the year award 
in announcing the recall wednesday ford said it knew of no 
accidents or injuries because of the problems 
spokesman mike parris said all of the cars were assembled at 
fords plant in lorain ohio between october 1988 and march 1989 
between 5 percent and 10 percent of them were thunderbird super 
coupes 
of all those recalled about 11250 thunderbirds and cougars also 
will be checked for a part which if left in place for a number of 
miles could cause the rear suspension to fall apart 
motor trend magazine gave its car of the year award to the 
thunderbird sc in january the car has had other problems since its 
formal introduction in december 1988 but wednesdays action was the 
first recall involving the super coupe 
ford said that during a full turn at less than 5 mph part of the 
front suspension of all the cougars and thunderbirds made during the 
fivemonth period could hit part of the brake mechanism 
that would cause an increase in pedal travel the next time the 
brakes were applied decreasing effectiveness ford said the problem 
could be repeated during the next lowspeed fullturn brake 
application 
also involved in recall were about 11250 thunderbirds and 
cougars made in midjanuary the company said 133 rearsuspension 
knuckles were heated improperly by a supplier which could result in 
cracks and failure of the suspension 
it wasnt clear how many cars received knuckles from the bad 
batch parris said a suspension knuckle is an arm that attaches the 
wheel assembly to the frame 
the company said it was unaware of any injuries or accidents 
because of either problem inspections and repairs will be performed 
free the company said 
the thunderbird sc which stands for super coupe has had other 
problems since production began last year 
ford withheld dealer deliveries of many of the cars late last 
year and early this year so it could replace a castiron crankshaft 
with a forged one crankshafts change the upanddown motion of the 
pistons to rotary motion that goes to wheels 
the crankshafts were replaced in the super coupe and the cougar 
xr7 
in february the company said it had completed replacing an 
engine mounting bolt in about 10600 of all versions of the 
thunderbird and cougar which never got to dealers

goodyear tire amp rubber co is withdrawing from 
south africa with the sale of a tire and general products 
subsidiary citing us sanctions and a devalued south african 
currency 
the sale of goodyears uitenhage south africa operations to 
consol ltd an industrial subsidiary of the south african financial 
industrial and mining group anglovall ltd was announced wednesday 
and is subject to government approvals 
consol said the purchase price was about 65 million 
goodyear said the sale would result in a onetime charge of about 
44 million after taxes or 77 cents per share to be recorded in 
the second quarter results and aftertax proceeds from the sale are 
expected to total about 45 million 
goodyear said most of the charge would result from the 
recognition of a decreased value of its assets in south africa 
related to the devaluation of the south african currency in recent 
years amid racial turmoil 
while we will regret leaving south africa after providing jobs 
and livelihood there for 42 years it is becoming increasingly 
difficult for american companies to obtain adequate returns on 
investments there said goodyear chairman tom h barrett 
he added that the withdrawal also was prompted by us sanctions 
including a double us tax on south african earnings 
goodyear has described anglovall as a responsible group that 
has demonstrated concern for human rights in the work place and has 
expressed intent to retain the current work force of 2400 people 
most of whom are nonwhite 
basil hersov chairman of anglovall has been on the 
goodyearsouth africa board for 23 years

bowing to complaints from viewers black flag 
will no longer play taps for ants and roaches in one of its 
insectspray commercials 
carol emerling a spokeswoman for american home products corp of 
new york makers of black flag insecticides said wednesday the few 
notes of the military bugle call at the end of the ad will be 
deleted within about two weeks 
we had some people call it to our attention and when that 
happens we look at it again she said 
among those who complained was korean war veteran bill temple of 
bryn mawr 
taps is a symbol he said it represents the finality of 
someones incredible sacrifice to trivialize it by playing it after 
blasting a bunch of ants and roaches away is terrible 
ms emerling wouldnt say who had prepared the commercial or how 
many complaints it drew 
temple was behind a drive to build a national korean war memorial 
and another to change a 1986 clint eastwood film to reflect that the 
army not the marines fought at heartbreak ridge one of the 
bloodiest battles in the korean war 
i lost an awful lot of buddies during that time i was in 
combat he said i know what taps means to the people who lost 
friends and relatives

rep dan rostenkowski chairman of the house 
ways and means committee is asking congress to kill a tax break for 
employee stock ownership plans on grounds it has been abused by 
lenders 
rostenkowski dill introduced a bill wednesday to repeal a 
1984 provision that allows banks and other lenders to escape taxes 
on half the income from loans made to such plans known as esops 
once again we have witnessed a special tax benefit provision 
become an abusive loophole through the ingenuity of wall street 
investment bankers rostenkowski said wednesday congress did 
not intend for this special tax provision to be used in such an 
excessive manner 
esops were given preferential treatment under federal tax law to 
make it easier for employees to buy stock in the companies for which 
they work in many cases esops have been used to keep alive 
employers threatened by bankruptcy 
the government estimates that 10 million workers are covered by 
about 10000 esops 
rostenkowski said there is evidence that many companies are 
borrowing to set up esops only to obtain a tax benefit while 
providing nothing new for employees 
he noted a weekold internal revenue service ruling that 
authorized public sale of bonds issued by esops that ruling 
rostenkowski said will produce even more esop borrowing 
he estimated the tax preference for esops will cost the treasury 
8 billion in lost revenues over five years

mccaw cellular communications inc today 
began its 585 billion tender offer for the shares of lin 
broadcasting corp it does not already own 
the 120 a share offer which will expire on july 6 unless 
extended requires among other conditions approval from the federal 
communications commission in a news release mccaw stated such 
approval could take six months 
shares of both companies edged lower in early trading today lin 
was down 175 to 12775 a share and mccaw dipped 75 cents to 
4625 in national overthecounter trading 
on wednesday a day after mccaw announced its bid for the new 
yorkbased cellular phone television and publishing company lin 
stock soared 26 a share to 12950 in overthecounter trading and 
mccaw stock rose 375 to 47 a share 
but the bid had a broad spinoff effect on the stock prices of 
other companies involved in the cellular telephone business 
officials at rival companies said the bid created a new benchmark 
for the value of their cellular properties 
we certainly see this as an important announcement said 
diane olberg of pacific telesis group in san francisco 
on the new york stock exchange pacific telesis rose 112 to 
42 and southwestern bell corp of st louis rose 1 to 5387 
cellular operations are a small part of those companies revenue 
by acquiring lin mccaw would have twice the potential cellular 
market of pacific telesis and southwestern bell its closest 
competitors 
combining both sets of franchises would form the regional 
supersystem of cellular holdings that mccaw has been seeking said 
analyst geoffrey johnson of argus research corp in new york 
cellular franchises have grown in popularity with improvements in 
technology and customer demand for mobile phones 
johnson said a battle for lins stock was likely 
the market is obviously anticipating a bidding war erupting 
he said 
spokespersons for pacific telesis and southwestern bell refused 
to comment on whether their companies are interested in lin 
although analysts have cited both as possible suitors 
mccaw spokesman steven bruce declined to say whether the company 
might raise its offer he would only say that the offer is on the 
table 
lin which said it was studying the offer has interests in 
cellular systems serving new york los angeles philadelphia dallas 
and houston in addition to owning seven networkaffiliated 
television stations and a specialty publishing house that produces 
hardcover tourist guides for hotel rooms 
mccaw lins largest shareholder has franchises serving 
customers in seattle san francisco miami denver minneapolis and 
portland ore 
lins rights in five of the nations top 10 markets would fit 
in very nicely with mccaws small to mediumsized properties 
johnson said 
details on how the deal would be structured will be announced 
before the end of the week bruce said 
analysts estimated mccaw has amassed close to 3 billion for the 
acquisition including 15 billion through the sale of a 22 percent 
interest to british telecommunications plc a 13 billion line of 
credit and 800 million in cash 
a source close to mccaw who asked not to be identified confirmed 
the company had put together around 3 billion 
mccaws offer values lin at about 65 billion but since mccaw 
already owns 98 percent of lin it would cost 585 billion to 
acquire the remaining shares 
two weeks ago lin announced its board had approved in principle 
spinning off a new subsidiary that would own its tv stations it 
said it would operate its cellular operations and publishing 
business as a separate company 
lin said the move was made for operating and strategic reasons 
and was not intended as a precursor to any other corporate 
transaction 
mccaws cellular telephone systems serve 50 million pops an 
industry measure that refers to marketarea population multiplied by 
percentage ownership in the cellular systems serving those areas 
lin has more than 18 million pops while pacific telesis and 
southwestern bell each have about 30 million 
at 65 billion mccaw would be paying about 360 per pop as 
recently as 1986 mccaw was buying franchises for 6 per pop

cooperation agreement with the soviet union 
in a speech to a conference in moscow external relations 
commissioner of the 12nation european economic community frans 
andriessen said formal negotiations on a pact could start before

for a mandate to start negotiations with the soviet union

soviet union saying that the accord would include most favored 
nation treatment under international trade rules established by 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the agreement also would offer management training joint 
ventures and other forms of business cooperation andriessen

used mainly by business travelers it was easterns only consistent 
profit maker before the march 4 strike miamibased eastern filed 
for bankruptcy protection from creditors on march 9

kuwait today confirmed it would refuse to 
obey the new production limits approved just a day earlier by the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
ali khalifa alsabah told reporters kuwait has temporarily pulled 
out of the opec quota system because the cartel failed to increase 
kuwaits share of total production in the last half of the year 
but he insisted we will use that freedom from the quota 
system very very responsibly 
the new agreement was designed to keep a firm grip on production 
in order to keep prices strong oil markets initially reacted with 
skepticsm to the cartels ability to restrain output but us crude 
prices appeared to stabilize somewhat today 
sabah said kuwait intended to produce 135 million barrels a day 
in the coming months compared to its quota of 109 million barrels 
its current production is estimated at 16 million barrels a day or 
more 
other ministers appeared to accept kuwaits position saudi 
arabias hisham nazer indicated that kuwaits extra sales would be 
tolerated as long as they did not exceed 135 million barrels a day 
after six days of bargaining the cartel agreed to boost its 
output ceiling to 195 million barrels a day in the julydecember 
period up a million barrels from the current level 
they agreed to divide up the extra sales proportionately among 
all members 
to meet the new ceiling some of the countries will have to cut 
their production analysts estimate output has picked up in recent 
weeks to 21 million barrels a day 
nazer said he would have liked the production cap set at 20 
million barrels a day in the second half of the year but he said 
several producers were worried a higher ceiling might have an impact 
on prices 
the ministers agreed to meet again in september and decide 
whether to boost their output to 20 million barrels a day beginning 
oct 1 
the cartel has been pumping an estimated 21 million barrels a day 
in recent weeks analysts say so the producing nations would have 
to turn down their taps to meet the new supply level 
everybody is supposed to rein in production levels to their 
assigned quota said opec president rilwanu lukman 
the members also decided to keep their benchmark price at 18 a 
barrel about the current price of a basket of crudes monitored by 
opec 
paul mlotok head of energy research at morgan stanley amp co in 
new york said the new arrangement should not have a signficant 
impact on gasoline prices at the pump 
production cutbacks made early in the year by the cartel have 
sent us gasoline prices soaring 
on the new york mercantile exchange futures prices for west 
texas intermediate the american benchmark crude closed down 79 
cents to 1967 a barrel on wednesday but the nearterm contract 
was up 5 cents at midday 
mlotok said prices fell because the markets figured the nations 
would continue producing at the present pace 
current output levels he said are a bit high to support 
a price over 20 so they took the price down about a dollar 
in reaching an agreement the organization rejected demands by 
kuwait the united arab emirates and others for a bigger share of 
the pie 
kuwaits insistence on a larger chunk caused talks to break down 
tuesday 
in pressing for a greater share of the increase kuwait was 
pitted against influential saudi arabia the worlds largest crude 
exporter 
saudi arabias nazer wanted the increase shared on a prorata 
basis among all members 
if it is found that the demand warrants an increase in the 
ceiling then this can be raised to 20 million barrels per day or 
any other level agreed upon said a statement released by the 
ministers any adjustments would be made oct 1 
prices have been much stronger than expected due to opec cutbacks 
earlier in the year and accidents in key oilproducing regions 
restricting supply 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by the 
cartel exceeded the 18 reference earlier in the year 
with the recent pickup in opec production prices have eased some 
but are still more than 40 percent higher than late last november 
the ministers statement said they intend to talk to independent 
producing nations with a view to soliciting their cooperation in 
support of market stability 
some of those countries agreed earlier in the year to curtail 
their output to help bolster prices 
opecs members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia uae and 
venezuela

grain and soybean futures opened mixed this 
morning on the chicago board of trade despite the continued concern 
over conditions in china 
early trading indicates wheat prices are firming although 
analysts say traders are worried about delays in the shipment of 
wheat on order by the chinese but the market is largely ignoring 
the turmoil still evident in that nation and the possible impact it 
could have on future grain sales 
favorable weather outlooks are expected to put pressure on corn 
and soybean prices 
however soybean futures could get a boost from a threatened 
sales boycott by brazilian farmers who say they are worried about 
their governments exchange rate policy in addition dockworkers in 
brazil are threatening another nationwide port strike which would 
hamper that soybean exports 
a strike by dockworkers last month shut down most brazilian ports 
in early trading wheat was a cent to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 384 a bushel corn was cent to 
1 cents lower with july at 255 a bushel oats were a cent to 1 
cent higher with july at 163 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent lower 
to 8 cents higher with july at 719 a bushel 
livestock prices were mostly lower and meat futures were mixed in 
early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 33 cent lower to 23 cent higher with june at 
6905 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 13 cent 
higher with august at 7887 cents a pound hogs were 05 cent to 18 
cent lower with june at 4845 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 23 cent to 30 cent higher with july at 32 cents a pound

time inc and warner communciations inc have an 
array of options to protect their planned merger deal despite 
paramount communications incs 107 billion buyout offer for time 
securities analysts expressed little doubt that time would resist 
the unsolicited tender offer that paramount launched only 2 weeks 
before shareholders are to vote on the timewarner merger that would 
create the worlds largest media and entertainment concern 
top executives of both time and warner were said to be 
unavailable wednesday for comment on what course they intend to take 
peter appert media analyst at cj lawrence morgan grenfell 
inc said he expects time officials will be pretty tough about 
trying to retain their independence 
paramount the entertainment and publishing concern formerly 
called gulf amp western inc said late tuesday it was launching a 
tender offer of 175 in cash for each of times shares 
that bid prompted heavy trading wednesday in the stock of all 
three companies time jumped 44 to close at 170 a share in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading while warner rose 
175 to 5350 a share and paramount rose 75 cents to 5475 a 
share 
at midday today time was down 275 to 16775 warner was up 
112 at 5462 and paramount ws up 212 at 5687 
among the options securities analysts said time was likely to be 
considering were making its own tender offer for warner or turning 
the tables on paramount by making a pacman takeover bid for the 
uninvited suitor 
analysts said time previously arranged a 5 billion line of 
credit that could be used if a competing bidder emerged the down 
side is that a buyout would dilute times earnings by saddling it 
with debt 
they said time could exercise of any of several takeover 
defenses including a poisonpill that would make stock 
available to its shareholders at a bargain rate making a hostile 
takeover more expensive 
time and warner also could buy stakes in each other under terms 
of their merger plan a move that would further dilute their stock 
and make a takeover of either of them more costly 
john reidy media analyst for drexel burnham lambert inc said 
he doesnt think the paramount offer necessarily dooms the 
timewarner merger plan but he said it is hard to envisage a 
shareholder vote taking place in two weeks while the paramount offer 
is outstanding 
warner and time shareholders are scheduled to vote june 23 on the 
merger 
paramount filed a lawsuit in delaware chancery court seeking to 
block time and warner from exercising contingency plans designed to 
deter uninvited biddders from interfering with their merger but a 
judge declined wednesday to immediately grant paramounts requests 
also wednesday warner said it had filed suit in new york state 
supreme court against citibank seeking an order that would prevent 
the bank from providing or arranging the 14 billion in financing 
that paramount said the bank plans to arrange for its bid the sum 
includes the cost of buying times shares refinancing debt and 
other costs 
warner said it had an agreement with citibank under which the 
bank had agreed not to help finance an unsolicted offer that would 
interfere with the merger between warner and time 
in a statement citibanks parent citicorp said it was not 
aware of any violation of any agreement with warner 
paramount chairman martin davis met privately with securities 
analysts wednesday saying that while the deal would result in 
significantly lower earnings in the near term the chance to buy 
time was a onceinalifetime opportunity to maximize paramount 
communications longterm potential 
he told the analysts he has no plans to sell any assets 
time a publishing and cable giant may have a tough job 
explaining to its shareholders how the proposed stock swap merger 
with warner would be a better deal than the 175 a share in cash 
that paramount is offering 
under the planned timewarner merger time shareholders would get 
a share in the new company for each share they currently own while 
warner shareholders would get 0465 share of the new company for 
each warner share 
j kendrick noble media analyst for painewebber inc said he 
estimated the combined companys stock would trade at about 110 a 
share 
but he said that figure is not strictly comparable with the 175 
a share price paramount is offering because anyone taking that 
offer would face a capital gains tax and would have to give up their 
stock to boot 
some credit has to be give to the idea of continuing to be an 
equity investor he said

american businesses plan a strong 65 percent 
increase in plant and equipment spending this year the government 
said thursday and economists said the investments would help 
economic expansion while tending to limit inflation 
analysts said much of the spending will involve equipment that 
would permit businesses to modernize their production capabilities 
thereby reducing both costs and prices 
according to the commerce department survey completed in may 
business investment is now estimated at 45143 billion for 1989 up 
from 42369 billion in 1988 the numbers are adjusted for inflation 
although the economy has been slowing this year business 
spending plans have been expanding 
in an initial survey completed last december businesses told the 
department they planned a 59 percent increase in expansion and 
modernization spending this year a survey completed in march showed 
the forecast rising to 63 percent 
just about all of the increase is projected in equipment rather 
than physical plants according to irwin kellner chief economist 
for manufacturers hanover in new york 
this is good in the sense that it shows that industry is aware 
that it has to improve product quality and reduce input costs he 
said to the extent that industry is more productive it will hold 
down inflation 
the federal reserve has been putting upward pressure on interest 
rates for 15 months as it attempted to slow the economy and ease 
inflation 
the spending forecast suggests the slowdown is not about to turn 
into recession 
basically this is a plus for the economy both in terms of 
continued expansion and over the longer time helping relieve 
pressure on capacity and therefore limit the extent that price 
pressures will accelerate said david m jones chief economist 
for aubrey g lanston amp co in new york 
both jones and kellner said one drawback to the increased 
spending is that much of the new equipment is expected to be 
imported 
so even as businesses become even more productive on the one 
side kellner said on the other theyre adding to the balance 
of trade deficit 
but at the same time jones said much of the spending to 
increase capacity is to meet expanding orders for us exports 
capital spending grew 101 percent in 1988 as companies rushed to 
expand production to meet rising export demand 
that was the sharpest increase since a 166 percent hike in 1984 
when businesses were still recovering from the 198182 recession 
since then spending fell 39 percent in 1986 but rose 23 percent 
in 1987 
business investment in the manufacturing sector was forecast to 
increase 36 percent to 17054 billion this year compared to a 
128 percent rise in 1988 that includes a 14 percent hike in 
industries producing durable goods those expected to last three 
years or more nondurable spending was expected to rise 57 percent 
nonmanufacturing spending in such industries as mining and 
transportation was seen rising 84 percent to 28089 billion 
compared with last years 84 percent increase 
before adjusting for inflation 1989 plant and equipment spending 
is expected to rise by 99 percent to 47208 billion down from 
103 percent in 1988

born in protest 54 years ago the united auto 
workers union today advocates constructive teamwork with company 
bosses and it bargains contracts for professionals who range from 
clerks to jai alai ballplayers 
the 1 million member union is discovering as have manufacturers 
and other labor organizations that peaceful coexistence and 
diversification can be keys to survival 
the transition has come at a price 
the uaw is taking an increasingly active role in running 
companies from the board room to the factory floor this has shaken 
the workings of a labor organization that up to now has largely 
avoided the factionalism plaguing some sister unions 
as uaw members prepare for a convention later this month their 
agenda will include how to address a growing dissident movement that 
claims the union has forgotten the lessons of history 
during the past three years the new directions movement has 
grown within the uaw urging the organizations leaders to honor the 
axiom managers manage and workers work 
new directions leader jerry tucker says the union is getting too 
chummy with management in developing team approaches to the job and 
assisting with problemsolving on the plant floor 
it goes deeper than that he says 
ive been trying to force a debate on fundamentals from the 
start of this thing about five years ago tucker says im 
relentless in my pursuit of answers to why certain hallowed 
principles have to be discarded and if they have to be discarded in 
favor of corporatist activity whats in it for us 
jobs says uaw president owen bieber as times change so must 
the union 
that doesnt mean the uaw isnt prepared to fight companies its 
been building up a strike fund which now totals 740 million and 
pays 100 a week and insurance coverage per worker during walkout 
they came up with the slogan of new directions he says i 
must say that i fail to see that i sort of equate them to george 
bush i dont know what that program is because nobodys explained 
that program 
the drive of new directions really isnt new at all says david 
cole director of the office for the study of automotive 
transportation at the university of michigan 
new directions despite their name is very much oriented to 
the old ways he says the loosely knit group claims widespread 
shoplevel support but declines to estimate it in numbers 
in one sense labor specialists agree the union will benefit 
from the debate new directions is forcing the movement is by far 
the most serious and most public challenge to the uaw leadership 
since the unions founding in flint mich on aug 26 1935 
its good for the union to have a debate says david bensman 
director of the graduate program in labor studies at rutgers 
university in new brunswick nj when you have people who are 
critical it forces or gives the leadership more incentive to 
explain its policies to the members 
that debate comes as the union looks outside the automobile 
industry for membership growth the uaw has organized some state 
workers in michigan university staff in new england and jai alai 
players in connecticut florida and rhode island 
for years it has represented aerospace agricultural equipment 
and clerical workers 
riki lasa a professional jai alai player and president of uaw 
local 8868 said his organization talked with other unions 
including the united food and commercial workers and the hotel and 
restaurant employees before deciding in june 1988 to affiliate with 
the uaw 
they spoke about the democracy within the union that we the 
players make our decisions lasa says the 500 players are 
continuing a strike that began april 14 1988 over claims that 
management violated federal labor laws 
the jai alai players are seeking their first contract with 
management 
the uaw also has been looking outside the auto industry in 
advertising campaigns that have cost the union 20 million during 
the 1980s 
the most recent campaign running in large media markets and 
costing the union about 4 million reminds americans of labors 
role in building the economy and criticizes financiers to make quick 
profits on takeovers 
some doubt the ads effectiveness 
they probably make the people who run them feel better says 
ad analyst james dougherty of county securities in new york 
the uaws outside recruiting success hasnt been matched in the 
newest segment of the auto industry transplants from abroad 
japanese companies and joint ventures between japanese and us 
automakers have been erecting carmaking plants in the united states 
since 1982 some now are expanding 
the uaw has organized workers at the mazda motor corp plant in 
flat rock mich and two joint ventures the new united motor 
manufacturing inc factory by general motors corp and toyota motor 
corp and the chryslermitsubishi motors corp diamondstar motors 
corp plant in bloomington ill 
but workers in toyotas georgetown ky honda motor corps 
marysville ohio and nissan motor corps smyrna tenn assembly 
plants arent unionized 
nobody will admit this bieber says but there cant be any 
secret as to why they located any of these plants out there in the 
hinterlands its also no accident that most of the people who got 
hired probably had their ancestry checked through at least three 
generations to find out whether anyone ever belonged to a union or 
not 
weve had an extremely tough time in organizing and honda was 
a good example he said in march 1986 in marysville on the eve 
of a representation election the uaw fearing defeat withdrew 
its bid to unionize the workers 
harley shaiken a labor professor at the university of california 
at san diego says worker boredom could help bring more transplants 
into the union fold 
i think they will be organized i think when they will be 
organized is hard to gauge he says 
in the late 1970s the uaw had more than 15 million members 
today it stands at 1 million a decline that is a trend in 
organized labor union workers also have become more conservative 
partly because of the popularity of former president reagan 
reagan had a tremendous hold on our membership said former 
uaw president douglas fraser now a professor at wayne state 
university in detroit 
he was kind of a macho man and the bluecollar worker is sort 
of a macho fellow and that had a great attraction for them 
also i think that some of our members thought that the union 
leadership and the liberals were too caught up in equal rights and 
the other factor is that i believe that as their income increases 
their values change 
the base hourly wage for an auto assembler is about 1450 an 
hour among the highest of any us factory worker today when 
health and other benefits are included annual compensation is about 
37000 more with overtime of that workers pay the equivalent of 
two hours pay per month in dues

kuwait said thursday it will pump extra 
crude in the coming months in defiance of the latest opec production 
accord and other cartel members could follow suit 
just a day after an agreement was reached kuwaiti oil minister 
ali khalifa alsabah said his country has temporarily withdrawn from 
opecs quota system because other ministers failed to increase its 
share of total production in the last half of the year 
other members of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries appeared to accept kuwaits decision to cheat on 
the new agreement 
in fact the united arab emirates and a few others were 
considered likely to ignore their output limits they too wanted a 
bigger share of the production pie 
but algerias sadek boussena said i think that all countries 
have committed themselves to something thats whats positive 
it was kuwaits insistence on a higher share of increased 
production that stalled negotiations for a new accord 
sabah said he wrote in the new agreement that he would not feel 
bound by his new quota but he also told reporters that kuwait 
will use that freedom from the quota system very very 
responsibly 
in restraining supply in the past he said kuwait has 
sacrificed more than the others for a very very long time 
but there is a limit to what we can do 
sabah said kuwait intended to produce 135 million barrels a day 
in the coming months noting that it is almost physically 
impossible to pump less than that in part because of commitments 
to longtime customers kuwaits new new quota is 109 million 
barrels and its current supply is estimated at nearly 2 million 
barrels 
saudi arabias hisham nazer indicated to a small group of 
reporters that kuwaits extra sales would be tolerated as long as 
they did not exceed 135 million barrels a day 
indonesias ginandjar kartasasmita noted kuwait would have to 
make cutbacks to come down to the promised level 
the accord is even better than what we could have dreamed of 
he said this is the maximum that we could have 
after six days of bargaining the cartel agreed to boost its 
supply ceiling to 195 million barrels a day in the julydecember 
period while that is up a million barrels from the current official 
level analysts estimated output in recent weeks has risen to 21 
million barrels a day 
the ministers agreed to divide the extra sales proportionately 
among all members to meet the new ceiling some countries will have 
to cut production 
nazer said he would have liked to see the ceiling upped to 20 
million barrels a day in the last half of the year but he noted 
that several of the opec members were just afraid it may have an 
impact on price 
the ministers said in a statement the ceiling could be raised to 
20 million barrels a day or more effective oct 1 if demand 
remained strong 
i honestly feel that demand in the market is much stronger 
nazer said 
boussena agreed saying that if prices hold steady there is no 
reason not to add another 500000 barrels a day to the cap 
opec retained in the new agreement its benchmark price of 18 a 
barrel the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by 
opec was nearly 1770 a barrel last week 
the new accord was designed to keep a firm grip on production so 
that prices would remain robust but oil markets reacted skeptically 
to the cartels ability to limit output us crude prices initially 
tumbled but recovered somewhat on thursday 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates 
and venezuella

foreign businesses confidence in china has been 
shattered by the eruption of violence 
it will take years to restore credibility jan vandenberg an 
economist at merrill lynch amp co said thursday in tokyo 
in washington the united stateschina business council said 
thursday that commercial and economic relations between the 
countries have been disrupted and could suffer longterm damage 
the business council said its members deplore the violent 
suppression and wanton killing of prodemocracy demonstrators in 
beijing and said the countries should preserve the links between 
us until they can again be expanded 
while some businesses away from beijing continue to do business 
as normal many report they have been crippled by workers staying 
home and expatriates leaving the country 
many companies that had been attracted by chinas cheap labor and 
huge potential market have been forced into a waitandsee attitude 
hoping their investments will survive 
kumigai gumi co a major japanese construction company has 
stopped work on a 51story skyscraper in beijing because of the 
danger we dont know when we can resume the project an 
official said it doesnt look like its going to be any time 
soon 
but mattel inc said it is continuing to operate two toy plants 
in guangdong province 1500 miles from beijing which make clothes 
for barbie dolls and some disneytheme preschool toys 
mcdonnell douglas corp ordered 51 employees and dependents at an 
airliner assembly plant outside shanghai to leave the country 
tuesday said garth chang douglas top asiabased executive in hong 
kong 
workers werent aware of the turmoil that had engulfed the 
country because of the governments news blackout chang said 
mac jeffery spokesman for international business machines corp 
in tokyo said the company has 120 employees in china supplying and 
maintaining computers half are foreigners he said and all but two 
of those had left china by thursday 
the office is technically open but if someone needs service 
it would depend on the situation whether we could help he said 
i wonder what business is to be had jeffery added 
about 30 american staffers of an occidental petroleum corp coal 
mine in northcentral china were on a us governmentchartered 
evacuation flight from beijing thursday they declined to give their 
names to a reporter at tokyos narita airport but said there had 
not been any trouble at the mine 
the danger of being on beijing streets caused sanyo electric co 
to tell some 100 workers to remain at home and not report to their 
jobs at a joint venture plant in the capital making electronic 
calculators sanyo said in tokyo 
nippon steel corp spokesman takeshi itagaki said the company had 
no problems at a project giving technical assistance to a steel 
plant near shanghai and its exports of steel products to 10 chinese 
cities were going ahead normally 
yokogawa electric corp a leading japanese manufacturer of 
industrial instruments shut a joint venture factory in xian shaaxi 
province early this week said spokesman takeshi mizuno 
the 260 workers are participating in rallies in protest against 
the military suppression in beijing mizuno said even students 
and workers from other factories are coming to call for a series of 
major protest rallies some circles in the city are calling for 
a general strike 
japanese foreign minister hiroshi mitsuzuka speaking in 
parliament thursday said it cannot be denied that the 
international image of china has been impaired a lot 
singapore where for five years the government has urged 
businessmen to boost trade ties with china also expressed worry 
that the violence could damage chinas open door economic policy 
of welcoming foreign investment 
after hearing of the violence early this week prime minister lee 
kwan yew said we hope wiser counsels will prevail to pursue 
conciliation so that the chinese people can resume the progress 
which the open door policies have brought them 
the turmoil has caused some price jumps for commodities exported 
by china such as peanuts soybeans and silk cocoons

they dont recognize each other diplomatically 
but the worlds largest developing country and one of the smallest 
and most prosperous had been seeking mutual benefits from investment 
and tourism 
now bankers and businessmen in singapore who followed official 
calls to try to exploit the vast market in china are bracing for 
serious disruption and possible losses 
over the last five years the government urged businessmen to 
bolster their established trade ties with china through direct 
investments in manufacturing and hotel concerns in addition 
singapore lifted travel restrictions on its citizens visiting china 
after a process of gradual easing that began in the early 1980s 
the drive to strengthen business ties coincided with chinas 
appointment in 1985 of goh keng swee as an adviser to help develop 
coastal economic zones goh is singapores former deputy prime 
minister and is widely credited with the countrys industrial 
transformation in the 1970s 
hopes of exploiting beijings opendoor economic policy are 
stalled and almost certainly will be reassessed after the turmoil in 
china 
a china with large sections of her people including her best 
educated at odds with the government means trouble with people 
resentful reforms stalled and economy stagnant prime minister 
lee kuan yew said after hearing of the initial violence 
because of her size such a china could create problems for 
herself and her neighbors in asia lee said singapore is a small 
island nation more than 1000 miles south of china 
we hope wiser counsels will prevail to pursue conciliation so 
that the chinese people can resume the progress which the open door 
policies have brought them the prime minister said 
lee hsien loong singapores trade and industry minister and the 
prime ministers eldest son offered his country two years ago as an 
efficient gobetween for international traders seeking contacts in 
china we can smooth the way for the international business 
community to do business with china and we can also help albeit in 
a small way to further modernize chinas economy 
lee hsien loong said this thriving country was a useful 
commercial gateway because of formal agreements already in place 
these promise to protect investments by the singaporebased 
subsidiaries of multinationals avoid double taxation and guarantee 
the entry of goods and services into the chinese market 
tourism officials in 1987 started promoting singapore in the 
united states as a complementary destination to china one objective 
was to persuade us travel agents to arrange package tours 
featuring singapore and china as joint destinations with common 
attractions 
the china connection goes back to singapores founding as as 
british colonial trading post in 1819 when it became a magnet for 
migrating chinese peasants the population is 26 million about 76 
percent of whom are ethnic chinese and mandarin is one of four 
official languages 
despite being only slightly larger than chicago singapore is 
chinas fifth largest export market after hong kong japan the 
european economic community and the united states much of it for 
reexport to the rest of southeast asia 
trade between china and singapore quardrupled in the past decade 
to 225 billion last year 
the foreign ministry has advised all singaporeans to leave 
beijing and the trade development board advised businessmen to 
postpone trips to china 
after the feb 23 announcement that indonesia and china would 
restore diplomatic ties within a year officials said singapore 
would follow suit within a few months officials declined to comment 
on whether the turmoil would delay that

first came levine then there was boesky then 
drexel burnham lambert 
the three blockbuster fraud cases epitomized the success of the 
securities and exchange commission in exposing financial skulduggery 
and toughening securities law enforcement standards in the 1980s 
now with the federal agencys enforcement chief chairman and 
several other top officials stepping down what can the sec do for 
an encore 
i think what we have seen is some very good cops and robbers 
work said sec commissioner joseph grundfest who has announced 
hes leaving in mid1990 to teach at stanford university the 
division has scored bulls eyes with big cases 
the direct hits constituted a domino effect that thrust the 
55yearold federal agency charged with policing the nations 
financial markets into the spotlight during a wildly prosperous 
decade whose handmaiden was scandal 
a tip about suspicious trading practices at a bahamian bank 
eventually led to drexel burnham lambert inc investment banker 
dennis levine who in 1986 agreed to relinquish 126 million in 
insider trading profits and penalties 
levine cooperated with the government and ratted on speculator 
ivan boesky who paid 100 million in forbidden profits and 
penalties for insider trading and named names including drexel and 
its junkbond impresario michael milken 
drexel is paying 650 million in fines and restitution milken 
has been indicted for fraud and racketeering and could face even 
bigger financial punishment 
those cases along with a calm response to the 1987 stock market 
crash raised the secs stature and stirred calls in congress to 
boost funding for an agency that raises for the treasury nearly 
three times its annual budget 
but with most of the drexel matter resolved sec enforcement 
director gary lynch said he is leaving in july after four years atop 
the agency police squad sec chairman david ruder a reagan 
administration appointee is stepping down to return to teaching 
which will allow president bush to shape the agency 
besides grundfest the other three commissioners are rumored on 
the way out two are serving without senate confirmation and one 
edward h fleischman is said to be considering resigning if he 
isnt named to succeed ruder 
all that should point to a period of transition and uncertainty 
at the washingtonbased agency founded during the depression in 
response to the crash of 1929 but staffers and outsiders said 
enforcement groundwork laid down by lynch should ensure a smooth 
continuation 
the sec really has a very strong sense of continuity said 
alan bromberg a securities law professor at southern methodist 
university its a lot like the british government the prime 
minister may change but the people in the bureaucracy tend to be the 
same over time 
theres no need to bring in anyone to clean things up or change 
direction radically he said 
things have continued to work pretty much as usual said 
william mclucas an associate enforcement director and a top 
candidate for lynchs job 
there is some level of anticipation about who the new chairman 
will be and who the director of the division will be he said 
its not a paralyzing kind of thing just the kind of thing youd 
normally expect to be on peoples minds 
aside from the new leadership two factors could dictate whether 
the sec remains in the spotlight one is the direction of the 
economy which historically influences the nature of financial 
crime the other is whether the domino effect continues and the 
drexel case produces another highprofile bust 
a legitimate question is whats going to be the next drexel or 
is there going to be a next drexel said barry goldsmith the 
secs deputy chief litigation counsel who helped handle the drexel 
case 
historically the pattern has been that each of these cases 
starting with levine has led to several others he said a 
question is is this going to end some time or is this going to keep 
continuing i dont know i really dont 
the bull market of the 1980s with large numbers of mergers and 
acquisitions led the commission to cases in which wall streeters 
used advance information of takeover activity to illegally trade in 
securities insider trading 
but if the economy slows as many experts predict merger 
activity already is showing a sharp decline the sec could uncover 
more financial disclosure improprieties as companies try to cut 
corners or tinker with statements 
its human nature not to want to disclose the bad news unless 
ones forced to said john sturc an associate enforcement 
director who also is in the running for the top job we had a lot 
of financial disclosure cases arising out of the 8182 recession 
the sec already is devoting more resources to fraud in cheap 
overthecounter securities known as penny stocks experts also 
predict more cases involving overseas transactions a reflection of 
the enforcement divisions liaisons with foreign government 
counterparts 
sec staffers said the agencys general enforcement philosophy 
changed in the early 1980s to concentrate more on the market process 
and financial reporting and less on tangential legal issues 
along with that came a more militant stance on sanctions 
including stiffer penalties in all cases and tough compliance 
provisions such as oversight powers against drexel 
there also has been more cooperation with the justice department 
in filing related criminal cases such as with milken and drexel 
my impression is that the commission in general felt a need for 
more significant sanctions against people who violate the law in the 
civil context said sturc 39 who has worked in the enforcement 
division seven years 
the sec isnt without problems staffing has increased by just 4 
percent in the 1980s to around 2130 while the commissions 
responsibilities workload and enforcement actions have soared 
sales on the nations securities exchanges have risen to 21 
trillion from about 540 billion in 1980 the number of brokerage 
firms jumped to 11900 from 6750 and of brokers and dealers to 
480000 from 196000 in the same period 
the sec collected 252 million in filing fees in fiscal 1988 up 
more than four times from 1980 but its budget at 143 million 
hasnt even doubled the sec is seeking 1687 million for fiscal 
1990 and has support from many congressmen who have sermonized 
about financial irregularity 
the commission also is seeking to boost salaries for its 800 
staff attorneys partly to halt a high turnover rate firstyear sec 
lawyers make 27172 a third or quarter of what top law firms offer 
its a chronic problem but its become dramatically acute 
said lawrence iason regional director of the secs new york office 
where staffing has been cut from from about 240 to 200 in recent 
years there are greater demands on our resources and we have 
fewer resources

when martin sorrell engineered an industry record 
566 million purchase of the parent of the j walter thompson 
advertising agency two summers ago he called it the opportunity 
of a lifetime 
but opportunity seems to have knocked more often than the 
bespectacled 44yearold financial maven foresaw his wpp group plc 
verges on a larger takeover the 864 million buyout of another 
madison avenue icon ogilvy group 
in his three years at wpp the cambridge and harvardeducated 
son of a british retailing executive has built a global 
communications empire 
hes done it by adding more than three dozen advertising public 
relations and marketing services firms to the framework of a company 
that still makes wire shopping baskets and plastic dish drainers 
the ogilvy deal expected to close within weeks will make wpp 
the worlds second biggest advertising and marketing company 
trailing only saatchi amp saatchi co plc where sorrell toiled nine 
years as the top financial officer 
sorrell has said the ogilvy purchase will make his company the 
worlds finest advertising and marketing services company but 
eschews any interest in surpassing saatchi as the largest 
his rapid rise to the top of the advertisingmarketing industry 
has left some people gushing at what they call his business genius 
and others describing him as arrogant and vindictive 
sorrell has been embroiled in a bitter legal battle for more than 
a year with a half dozen former executives of the ad agency lord 
geller federico einstein that wpp acquired as part of the j walter 
thompson deal 
the lord geller executives including agency founders richard 
lord and arthur einstein walked out in march 1988 to form their own 
agency after chafing under eight months of wpp ownership 
philip geier chairman of the advertising conglomerate 
interpublic group of cos has criticized sorrell for his 
unsolicited advances against both thompson and ogilvy 
he said wpps assault on ogilvy exposed sorrell as a financial 
gambler who has taken a major company that was doing fine and 
leveraged it to the hilt 
wpp is using a combination of stock and debt to finance the 
ogilvy takeover people close to sorrell say geier may be biased 
since interpublic failed in its eleventhhour bid to wrest ogilvy 
from wpps grasp by proposing a stock swap 
several top executives of the packaging design sales promotion 
and corporate identity firms that wpp has acquired say they are 
delighted with the deals they speak glowingly of the opportunities 
sorrell created for their businesses by associating them with a 
prestigious name like thompson and by imposing financial discipline 
they individually lacked 
wpps acquisition was the best thing that ever happened to 
reese said lynn pounian president of reese communications co 
inc a 20yearold marketing concern based in arlington va 
in a manner typical of sorrells approach in acquiring privately 
held companies wpp group bought reese in september 1987 for an 
initial payment of 14 million in cash and a promise to pay up to 
21 million more depending on earnings performance over the next 
several years 
the approach which sorrell honed during his days at saatchi 
enables wpp to hold onto the management of the companies it acquires 
by giving them a continuing stake in the success of the firm 
sorrell stays out of the daytoday operations of wpps 
companies but has them file daily financial reports and holds them 
accountable for meeting performance goals 
the critical thing is what questions you ask sorrell said in 
an interview following the thompson acquisition in 1987 if you 
ask certain things people in giving you the answers will ask 
themselves why did they ask me that question good things come 
out of that if you are asking the right questions 
reeses pounian said officials at her company rarely had time to 
ask themselves the financial questions sorrell asks and she 
welcomes the discipline 
is it a picnic in the park every day no but the benefits 
so outweigh the minor inconveniences that there is no question we 
are in a better position than we would have been she said 
sorrell who pronounces his name with the accent on the first 
syllable was born on valentines day in 1945 his father ran the 
retail division of a large british industrial concern and the 
youngster worked in its credit department when he was 16 he studied 
economics at cambridge university and earned an mba from harvard 
one harvard classmate alabama real estate developer still hunter 
jr remembers sorrell as very incisive very bright and a 
standout in finance if he believed in something he would 
persist hunter recalls 
after harvard sorrell worked for glendinning associates a 
marketing consulting firm in westport conn later bosses included 
sports promoter mark mccormack and food retailer and investor james 
gulliver both in london 
it was while working for gulliver that he met the saatchi 
brothers they hired sorrell as their top financial officer in 1977 
and the firm grew rapidly in the following nine years 
sorrell struck out on his own in 1986 as chief executive of wire 
amp plastic products precursor of wpp group 
he lives in hampstead near the north london neighborhood where 
he grew up he and his wife have three sons and sorrell spends his 
free time with them sometimes skiing or playing cricket

a federal bankruptcy judge thursday stripped 
allegheny international incs management of its exclusive right to 
file a plan to bring the company out of chapter 11 protection 
judge joseph l cosettis action means any creditor can file a 
plan to compete with one filed by the companys management 
reasons for the decision were not given but the move came after 
the about 10 days after allegheny international filed its fifth plan 
since entering chapter 11 in february 1988 its unsecured creditors 
are owed 220 million 
allegheny internationals lenders and unsecured creditors 
immediately said they would file reorganization plans of their own 
allegheny internationals most recent plan was to bring its 
sunbeam corp subsidiary the profitable small appliance maker that 
includes virtually all of alleghenys operating companies out of 
chapter 11 bankruptcy separately from the parent company 
gary blum an attorney representing company stockholders said 
cosettis action just made getting the financing impossible for 
the sunbeam plan 
the last reorganization plan for sunbeam would have paid cash to 
settle all of the approximately 240 million in claims pending 
against the subsidiary it would have left the pittsburghbased 
parent still in bankruptcy court to haggle with creditors 
after collapse of the fourth reorganization plan allegheny 
international said the judge was so aggravated that he suspended 
payment of most fees to attorneys and accountants involved in the 
case

wholesale gasoline and crude oil prices rose 
thursday rebounding from the previous sessions sharp selloff 
home heating oil futures finished lower depressed by sluggish 
demand typical for this time of year 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for july 
delivery of unleaded gasoline rose 066 cent to 64 cents a gallon 
after wednesdays loss of 160 cents 
the july contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil settled at 20 per 42gallon barrel a gain 
of 33 cents for the day the crude contract had dropped 79 cents 
wednesday 
but the selling continued in the heating oil pits although not 
as aggressively as on wednesday julydelivery no2 heating oil fell 
by 005 cent to 4866 a gallon adding a minor amount to wednesdays 
loss of 229 cents 
jerry samuels an energy broker at shearson lehman hutton inc 
attributed the buying of gasoline futures to renewed demand 
particularly for new york harbor delivery gasoline at the beginning 
of the peak summer driving season 
as the value of gas moves up so will crude said samuels 
heating oil got left in the dust which is understandable from a 
seasonal perspective 
crude also got a boost from buying in reaction to the tumble 
prices took wednesday when the outcome of the opec meeting 
disappointed the markets 
ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries ageed to boost the cartels production ceiling to 195 
million barrels a day in the julydecember period 
the new ceiling is 1 million barrels per day higher than the 
current level but below the estimated daily output in recent weeks 
of about 21 million barrels 
the opec ministers also decided during their vienna meeting to 
divide the extra production proportionately among all members 
analysts said this means that some countries will have to curtail 
some pumping to keep within their selfimposed quotas 
kuwait and several other opec members have indicated they intend 
to pump more crude than their quotas allow and energy brokers doubt 
opec will be able to control production enough to maintain strong 
prices

cable television operators are not stopping 
their viewers from seeing independent programming according to a 
study released thursday that was paid for by the operators 
when cable companies hold financial stakes in program services 
such as home box office showtime or mtv they dont try to keep 
their viewers from seeing nonaffiliated networks such as espn or 
usa the study said 
these large cable operators also dont refuse to license their 
program services to competing delivery systems such as microwave and 
backyard satellite dishes according to the study by benjamin klein 
an economics professor at the university of california at los 
angeles 
kleins study disputed assertions that giant cable operators such 
as telecommunications inc tci and american television and 
communications corp atc use their size to discriminate against 
program networks they do not own 
he said that although these companies are more inclined to carry 
the program services in which they have a stake they also are more 
likely than other cable operators to carry programming in which they 
have no investment 
but more importantly to cable tv viewers klein said cable 
operators willingness to invest in programming networks a practice 
known as vertical integration has led to an increased variety 
of programming choices not previously available to television 
consumers 
as this landmark report illustrates cables investment in 
programming has enabled our industry to offer consumers a new and 
better type of television national cable television association 
president james mooney said 
ncta released the report less than a week before a senate 
subcommittee was scheduled to begin hearings on increased 
concentration of media ownership it did not say how much klein was 
paid for it 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio has proposed that no single 
company may own cable systems that reach more than 25 percent of the 
nations cable households similar to federal regulations on 
overtheair broadcasters 
metzenbaum also has proposed a bill that would prevent cable 
operators who hold financial interests in program services from 
denying the services to competitors such as wireless cable 
microwave companies 
klein studied 400 us cable systems of varying sizes and markets 
and found that vertically integrated multiplesystem operators are 
somewhat more likely to carry networks in which they have an 
ownership interest 
however he said this effect is generally small because the 
vertically integrated companies have ownership interests in 
relatively few networks compared to the 40 50 or even 120 channels 
they may carry 
he said four large vertically integrated cable operators tci 
atc viacom and cablevision systems have ownership interests in an 
average 78 program networks among the top 28 networks whereas he 
said the average cable system has 43 channels 
tci has interests in cable news network the discovery channel 
headline news and superstation tbs atc owns hbo and has stakes in 
cnn cable value network movietime and tbs viacoms interests 
include showtime the movie channel mtv nickelodeon and vh1 
while cablevision has interests in american movie classics cnn and 
shop television network 
klein found that on average the most popular networks are carried 
by 51 percent more of the cable systems owned by the four 
vertically integrated companies than they are by 153 nonaffiliated 
cable systems in the study 
cable systems owned by the four large companies carried lifetime 
171 percent more than nonaffiliated cable systems they carried 
usa 24 percent more mtv 46 percent more and espn equally 100 
percent 
vh1 was carried 7 percent less by the four large companies and 
the movie channel was carried 62 percent less by the four companies 
the four companies provide service to 19 million or about 39 
percent of the nations 486 million cable subscribers which klein 
said was not a large enough slice of the cable audience to allow 
them to prevent entry of new programming networks

a hostile suitor for prime computer inc said 
thursday the computer maker showed no interest in a merger during a 
meeting but prime termed the charge a gross misrepresentation 
bennett s lebow chairman of mai basic four inc accused prime 
of refusing to provide confidential information it has given other 
prospective bidders during a meeting over their prolonged and 
contentious takeover battle 
he said in a statement that primes representatives evidenced 
no interest in negotiating a business combination of prime and mai 
at this time on the terms of mais current tender offer 
prime responded by saying it was shocked at the gross 
misrepresentation of the meeting by lebow 
tustin califbased mai last november launched a hostile 
takeover bid for the natickbased minicomputer maker its latest 
offer is worth about 105 billion 
prime confirmed that its chairman david dunn and two board 
members met with lebow and his partner william weksel on wednesday 
we went into the meeting in good faith without lawyers or 
other advisers attending totally willing to enter into meaningful 
discussions as we are with any qualified buyer said anthony l 
craig primes chief executive 
to have mai represent us as showing no interest in 
negotiating is simply a gross misstatement he said 
craig also said primes representatives gave lebow the same 
projections of earnings income and costs that have been supplied to 
other potential bidders 
last week mai cut its tender offer for primes stock from 20 
cash per share to a mixture of cash and securities valued by most 
wall street analysts at 17 to 19 a share said barry willman an 
analyst with the investment firm of sanford bernstein amp co in new 
york 
the original allcash offer amounted to about 970 million for 
primes outstanding shares or 125 billion for all of its stock 
including shares that can be converted from bonds 
the new offer is worth about 105 billion for all of the stock 
said jay stevens an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in new 
york 
prime has said that if it does not receive a better offer before 
its annual meeting it will enter into negotiations with lebow to 
explore a merger 
mai has filed a lawsuit in delaware chancery court to try to 
compel prime to hold the annual meeting june 14 as previously 
scheduled prime announced this week it was rescheduling the meeting 
to july 26 a hearing on the suit is set for next week 
wednesdays meeting took place at lebows request 
a prime spokeswoman said it was the first meeting between lebow 
and top prime executives since last fall when lebow met with former 
prime chief executive joe henson shortly before launching the 
hostile bid

burger king corp is reviewing its exclusive soft 
drink contract with pepsico inc and has asked cocacola co for a 
counter proposal a company spokeswoman said thursday 
its part of a normal vendor review said cori zywotow 
spokeswoman for miamibased burger king the worlds secondbiggest 
fast food chain after mcdonalds we asked both pepsi and 
cocacola to submit proposals 
pepsico has held the account since 1983 the year cocacola lost 
it and expressed confidence that it would continue providing the 
soft drinks on burger kings menu 
weve got a good record with miami and with the franchises 
said tod mackenzie a spokesman at pepsi cola co headquarters in 
somers ny

king sales accounted for 27 percent of pepsis total softdrink 
volume and 136 percent of its fountain volume last year 
in atlanta cocacola spokesman randy donaldson said his company 
had no comment on the proposal request 
pepsis mackenzie said the review was expected in light of the 
new corporate ownership of pillsbury co and the new management team 
at burger king 
pillsbury burger kings parent company was bought out by grand 
metropolitan plc last winter changes made since at burger king 
include the appointment of gary l langstaff a former top executive

us hightechnology manufacturers are facing 
unprecedented attacks from abroad rep mel levine said thursday in 
calling for businessgovernment consortia to reestablish american 
world competitiveness 
as a result of foreign strategies successfully targeting the 
key technologies and industries of the 1990s americas industrial 
lead is today threatened for the first time since henry ford 
invented the modern assembly line levine told a housesenate 
panel 
the committee is exploring governmentsupported research and 
manufacturing consortia that could help boost fledgling industries 
such as highdefinition television 
american companies cannot compete individually against this 
foreign targeting and will be increasingly forced to form consortia 
as well as other cooperative ventures in order to regain 
technological and industrial parity levine said 
once american companies have led in creating such consortia and 
pledged significant resources to these consortia various forms of 
government assistance will often be necessary in order for the 
consortia to succeed he added 
the us electronics industry which was severely buffeted by 
foreign competition in the 1960s and 1970s is seeking a 
billiondollar program to help launch highdefinition television 
which promises snapshotsharp images with a number of medical 
educational military and entertainment applications hdtv could 
revitalize the ailing us semiconductor industry as well 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher is expected to propose to 
president bush this summer a program of tax incentives and antitrust 
exemptions that would allow us companies to join in hdtv 
manufacturing consortia 
but mosbacher has said these companies should not expect handouts 
from uncle sugar 
levine who chairs the congressional hdtv caucus and house export 
task force took exception to the uncle sugar characterization 
he said hightech consortia are being proposed by the most 
successful of our companies and industries if the electronics 
and other high tech industries seek government support today it is 
not because they need a handout but because foreign targeting has 
left them with no choice 
lee hamilton dind chairman of the joint economic committee 
said the focus of the panel was to go beyond hdtv and semiconductors 
to broader longterm policy issues that would help foster a 
stronger economy and improved competitive position 
those concerns including whether foreign companies should be 
allowed into consortia receiving federal support and the proper role 
for the defense advanced research projects agency in promoting 
commercial revitalization 
darpa director craig fields told the panel that his agency 
already has a 30year track record of successful governmentindustry 
research and development programs and that darpa now was supporting 
300 companies 
he said rampd is getting so expensive that few companies have the 
resources to go it alone he said consortia can combine diverse 
skills and talents and save money by eliminating duplication of 
effort 
the question of how much foreign involvement should be allowed 
was a tough problem to solve fields said given the complex nature 
of todays multinational corporations 
he said the defense department does support foreign firms in 
programs with us allies but we have not as yet significantly 
supported foreign firms in the development of socalled dual use 
technology technology critical for defense and also central to the 
civilian industrial base because we did not see a net gain for the 
us 
ralph e gomory a former vice president at international 
business machines corp said the problem is not conducting 
effective research which he said is a us strong point but 
applying that research to production as the japanese have done so 
successfully

gtech corp a major supplier of lottery 
networks long rumored as a takeover target said thursday a special 
managment committee would evaluate merger and takeover offers 
gtech acknowledged that certain parties have expressed interest 
in possibly acquiring the company but said no offers had been 
received 
the company said its directors were working with financial 
advisers bear stearns amp co and alex brown amp sons inc 
companies apparently from time to time visit gtech and raise 
the issue of possible business combinations cato carpenter an 
analyst with alex brown said from his baltimore office 
carpenter added that the company was not currently in 
negotiations but that it wanted a committee to monitor these 
inquiries 
rumors of a possible takeover first surfaced last fall with 
bally manufaturing corp of chicago most often identified as a 
possible suitor 
guy b snowden gtechs president was not in the office 
thursday his secretary said and could not be reached for comment 
carpenter said gtech was capable of adequately financing its 
growth and it isnt outright apparent why they would need to be 
acquired 
lower earnings last fall forced gtech to lay off 10 percent of 
its 1300 workers 
gtechs stock traded nationally over the counter closed 
thursday at 14 a share up 125 there were 253000 shares traded 
three times the normal activity carpenter said 
the company designs produces and installs computerized lottery 
networks with 32 customers on five continents including many of 
this countrys state lotteries much of its income comes from 
maintaining and operating the systems

eastern airlines presented a contract proposal 
thursday to the striking pilots union that seeks temporary pay and 
vacation reductions similar to those implemented for nonunion 
workers last week 
the proposal was made at the second official negotiating session 
since eastern was hit by a crippling strike march 4 the concessions 
are necessary to help the airline emerge from bankruptcy the 
company said at a news conference 
the air line pilots association responded by describing the news 
conference as a public relations hoax and said the contract 
proposal does not address the primary issues that led to the 
strike 
eastern officials said part of the latest proposal is identical 
to an offer first made last july new elements include the companys 
request that pilots take a 10 percent pay cut for six months and a 5 
percent cut during the second six months after a year pay would be 
fully restored 
eastern also proposed suspending contributions to a pension fund 
through 1990 and canceling vacations for the rest of this year 
as part of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy eastern last week 
announced an austerity program that includes a 20 percent pay cut 
for senior management and increased work hours at the same pay for 
nonunion employees vacations for those workers have been canceled 
for the remainder of the year 
alpa spokesman ron cole said the union was angry that eastern 
announced the proposal at a news conference before it was presented 
to alpa negotiators 
obviously the cameras are more important than the contract 
cole said its nothing more than a public relations hoax 
presented to establish a paper trail to the doors of the bankruptcy 
court where we expect eastern will file for abrogation of our 
contract 
eastern spokesman robin matell said abrogation of the contract 
is simply an option one that we would not even address at this 
time our primary thrust is to successfully negotiate a pilots 
contract 
a federal appeals court on wednesday rejected easterns request 
to have the pilots ordered back to work the pilots union says it 
has been honoring the picket lines of the machinists union while 
the company argued the pilots were striking to advance their own 
contract negotiations without going through federal mediation 
procedures as the machinists did 
the pilots last contract expired in july 1988 negotiations on a 
new agreement have been held off and on since august 1987 
eastern filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 five days after it 
was crippled by the strike by machinists pilots and flight 
attendants

the boeing co on thursday introduced its 
new 737500 a hightechnology jet designed to serve airlines flying 
shorter routes within a hub system 
boeing said it passed up a chance to unveil the twinjet at the 
ongoing paris air show because the new model of the 737 series is 
basically a familiar design that makes use of advances already 
employed in other boeing jets 
the successor of the 737200 twinjet will carry 108 passengers 
be quieter and consume 20 percent less fuel said joe ozimek a 
marketing manager for boeings 737 and 757 models 
industry analysts said the 737500 helps round out the boeing 
family and gives it a model in the 100passenger range 
i think what boeing is really trying to do is have a product 
for all ends of the market said bill whitlow jr an aerospace 
analyst for dain bosworth in seattle 
last april american airlines placed a 31 billion order with 
fokker the dutch plane maker for 150 planes that carry about 100 
passengers each 
the 737500 will have the same advanced engines and avionics of 
the 737300 and will have a range of approximately 3450 statute 
miles 
the first 737500 will be delivered to southwest airlines in 
march 1990 after flight testing to begin late this month ozimek 
said 
sixteen customers have placed 138 orders for the model which 
costs 24 million to 28 million depending on its interior 
configuration and the date of delivery 
the planes will be equipped with cfm563 engines which allow air 
to pass through them at a low velocity reducing noise and allowing 
the plane to meet the limits for noise set by the us government 
ozimek said the engines are produced in the united states by a 
joint venture of general electric co and snecma of france 
production of the 737500 is running ahead of schedule despite a 
backlog of orders for other boeing models the company currently has 
a backlog of 1558 aircraft which has pushed delivery dates to 1996 
boeing recently expanded its plant in auburn where much of the 
737 model is manufactured and assembled a 300 million expansion 
has started at boeings renton plant

president bushs plans to reduce auto 
emissions are expected to increase demand for cornbased ethanol and 
expand markets for other corn products a congressman says 
us rep tom tauke riowa said thursday he expects bush will 
place greater emphasis on alternative motor fuels such as ethanol 
as part of a clean air program the president is scheduled to 
announce monday 
the iowa corn promotion board has estimated that with just normal 
growth in gasohol use the united states would need 390 million 
bushels of corn to meet ethanol demand in 1989 about threequarters 
of the nations ethanol is produced in iowa and illinois 
tauke said he expects the presidents proposal to increase the 
demand for gasohol a blend of 10 percent ethanol and gasoline 
and to encourage higher concentrations of ethanol up to the use of 
pure ethanol as a fuel for cars buses and trucks 
if there is a commitment at the national level to have a 
substantial portion of the automotive fleet in the country or buses 
or trucks being operated by alternative fuels then theres going 
to be a major expansion in the use of ethanol tauke said 
bush is a longtime proponent of increasing the use of ethanol to 
clean auto emissions and reduce carbon monoxide and other pollutants 
in the air he promised thursday that he will unveil the most 
sweeping changes to the clean air act since it was last amended 12 
years ago 
the clean air program also will focus on factory emissions and 
acid rain on tuesday bush is scheduled to deliver a speech on 
alternative fuels at lincoln neb 
tauke said he based his assessment on the programs content on 
discussions he had wednesday with bushs chief of staff john 
sununu and other white house officials 
our expectation is that the announcement will include 
substantial incentives for the use of alternative fuels in some 
case the requirement for the use of alternative fuels tauke said 
use of ethanol as a motor fuel is touted for reducing the release 
into the air of carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide and smog tauke said 
ethanol also is safer and easier to transport than another 
alternative fuel coalbased methanol because it is not toxic and 
burns with a visible flame
