some might think a television show about 
home renovation would be as exciting as watching paint dry but 
pbs this old house has long since proved that americans love 
to watch other people fix up fixeruppers 
now this old house has this new host steve thomas an 
eclectic blend of thor heyerdahl ralph waldo emerson and robert 
redford 
pbs officials hope that thomas 36 an expert sailor carpenter 
world traveler and writer will dispel the whiff of scandal that 
hovered over the show when its original host bob vila left over a 
conflict of interest 
the popular vila began as cohost of the show with master 
carpenter norm abram 11 years ago he left after last season when 
an underwriter withdrew funding in a dispute over vilas commercial 
endorsements 
the show is produced at wgbhtv in boston and is broadcast more 
than 500 times a week by 315 pbs stations across the country 
reaching 15 million viewers and standing as public televisions 
highestrated halfhour show 
the new season of this old house premiered in some parts of 
the country last weekend and will be seen in other places later 
this week 
vilas departure prompted a flurry of more than 400 videotapes 
and resumes from people vying for the job about half the 
applicants were television professionals others had little more 
than rudimentary carpentry credentials and a pickup truck a 
concert pianist and a brain surgeon were among those interested 
but the man who won the job never applied thomas who had 
almost no oncamera television experience was in northwest alaska 
researching his new book on the arctic during the search for vilas 
successor 
he had returned to the 1836 colonial revival house he shares 
with his wife and 3yearold son on bostons north shore and was in 
the middle of his own renovation project constructing skylights 
when he got a call from wgbh publicist daphne noyes 
noyes was calling about thomas film the last navigator 
which aired on pbs stations in july but during the phone call she 
mentioned that vilas job was open and suggested thomas apply for 
the job 
ten days and one screen test later thomas who combines 
heyerdahls sailing zeal with emersons philosophical selfreliance 
and redfords telegenic good looks had the job 
thomas the grandson of a missionary who worked with eskimos in 
isolated point hope alaska appears to have inherited the hardy 
stock of his forebears 
since graduating from evergreen state college in olympia wash 
thomas has built boats worked construction skippered ships across 
the atlantic and pacific studied ancient celestial navigation with 
a master navigator written a book and helped produce a pbs film 
his latest project is a book about the arctic region where his 
father was born called the wilderness of ice and mind 
but thomas is fairly modest about his accomplishments 
basically im a bum he said in a recent interview in 
concord where he and abram will be dismantling an 1835 barn for 
most of this years show turning it into a singlefamily home 
ive done a bunch of different stuff there are those who would 
say ive never had a regular job 
thomas has supported himself since college by avoiding the 
office and desk grind he grew up in southern california where he 
learned to sail and surf early he also learned home renovation 
firsthand from his father who fixed up houses and sold them 
after college he sailed and raced extensively around the world 
during a 1979 voyage between the galapagos and the marquesas 
islands in the remote pacific without electronic navigation 
instruments thomas lost the nautical equivalent of an odometer and 
had to rely on his eyes to measure the speed of the boat 
i found i could do it accurately he recalled i decided i 
wanted to become completely selfreliant 
his desire to learn ancient navigation led him to a master 
navigator in micronesia who spoke only satawalese thomas learned 
the language enough to understand the navigator during a yearlong 
apprenticeship 
he later wrote the last navigator about the experience it 
became a segment for pbs adventure series 
thomas said he spent a weekend considering the this old 
house job and whether or not theyd even want me for it 
once he was hired thomas said he stuck close to the shows 
creator and producer russell morash and operated on fear and 
adrenaline he has done eight shows so far and said he has grown 
more comfortable in front of the camera 
thomas said morash talked about a 10year commitment and that 
sounded fine to me he calls the job with its july to march 
shooting schedule ideal for a writer and craftsman 
i have a tremendous respect and admiration for true 
craftsmanship the way a person unites his craft with the rest of 
his life its pretty amazing you can communicate something you 
feel deeply about and thats part of this job

nancy fife never doubted her husband had 
been scarred in mind and body by his viet cong captors that he was 
a tarnished and troubled war hero 
the night nearly 20 years ago when her sneakers seemed to drive 
robert fife berserk was all the proof she needed fife told her 
later that his captors used to wear sneakers when they came to his 
bamboo cage to beat him and urinate on him and that the enemy 
soldier he strangled when he escaped also was wearing canvas shoes 
then there was the manuscript her husband left when he died this 
summer at the age of 46 of selfinflicted carbon monoxide poisoning 
449 pages of vivid vietnam experiences 
but fife had never been to vietnam let alone been a hero 
misled by fife his therapist dr corydon hammond had 
concluded that he suffered from posttraumatic stress syndrome and 
was very much a casualty of the vietnam war a letter hammond 
wrote after fifes death included a general account of what he 
believed was his patients navy war experience 15 days of torment 
as a prisoner of war after the uss rangerbased f4 fighter on 
which fife was navigator was shot down in early 1966 
he was clearly depressed guiltridden angry alienated from 
people and viewed the world in a very negative manner as a result 
of his military service experiences particularly as a prisoner of 
war hammond wrote 
but fifes heroic identity was adopted to cover a lifetime of 
failure 
his image maintained through 23 years of marriage was 
shattered only when his widow tried to have his name included on 
the states vietnam war memorial using the letter from hammond as 
part of her evidence 
the utah vietnam era veterans memorial committee decided last 
month after some debate to place fifes name on the granite and 
marble structure to be dedicated saturday 
fifes would have been the last of 390 names on the memorial 
but while an artisan was preparing to engrave fifes name an 
associated press reporter who had searched unsuccessfully for 
veterans who served with the dead hero told mrs fife that her 
husband had lied 
i feel like ive been raped mrs fife said after being told 
of the deception revealed by navy records after a great deal of 
anguish she decided to tell the truth to her 21yearold son and 
her 19yearold daughter 
intellectually i know i have the right to be angry she 
said but even with all of this i first need to understand it 
all 
fife didnt usually talk much about vietnam but his wife had 
accompanied him to his first session with hammond in 1986 when he 
used the old fiction to try to justify his life 
fife had acquired a certificate purportedly from the uss ranger 
committee listing the medals he said he had burned at the time to 
protest bad treatment of vietnam veterans they included the navy 
cross the services highest award for valor 
lt jg robert j fife after 130 missions over enemy 
territory was one of only four naval aviators to escape from 
enemy prison camps according to the certificate which appeared 
to be signed by admiral thomas h moorer retired chief of naval 
operations 
at the reporters request jeannie kirk head of the navys 
awards and special projects branch tracked down fifes real navy 
records 
they showed he enlisted in september 1965 and was discharged 
eight months later as medically unfit because of bones broken in 
his right foot during childhood that hadnt mended properly 
his only medal was the defense service award given to everyone 
fife wanted to be remembered as the hero in his manuscript not 
as a man obsessed by the circumstances of his birth fife never 
knew his father and blamed his mother for making him a bastard 
said a sister lynda turcsanski 
his wife who met him in the months following his brief naval 
service knew him as a pornography addict who spent hours alone 
with his erotic trove 
friends and relatives knew fife as unreliable angry a dreamer 
a failed businessman who gambled away 172000 of a partners 
money a sometime truck driver a wouldbe writer 
hammond codirector of the sex and marital therapy clinic at 
the university of utah said he was not entirely surprised to learn 
fife was no hero 
assuming the identity of a vietnam veteran was assuming a 
disability that would excuse his deficiencies and gain him sympathy 
and understanding hammond said 
he was what we call personality disorder meaning very 
nonconforming rebellious somewhat antisocial hammond said 
i suspect the manuscript may have been a sort of lastditch 
effort at salvaging a little bit of selfesteem

a firstterm state representative and 
physician is in the center of floridas abortion storm this week 
because hes the only legislator who performs abortions making him 
a lightning rod for protests 
ben graber even gets hate mail 
they need something to marshal their forces around he said 
of abortion opponents the obstetriciangynecologists pompano 
beach womens clinic drew a raucous demonstration saturday three 
days before the state legislature was to begin a special session on 
abortion called by gov bob martinez 
they were frustrated by the florida supreme court decision 
they decided to make me the target an ideal situation with the 
legislative session coming up graber said monday 
the state supreme court last week cited the state privacy law to 
strike down a 1988 statute requiring minors to get parental consent 
for abortion uphold a womans unrestricted right to abortion in 
the first trimester and emphasize individual privacy rights in 
abortion decisionmaking 
the governor acted within weeks of the us supreme courts july 
3 ruling upholding missouri state restrictions on abortions making 
florida the first state since then to call a session devoted to 
abortion 
at saturdays demonstration graber said several of his 
patients none there for abortions were jostled by a 200strong 
crowd and others were scared away graber says he performs two or 
three abortions a week and only as part of his practice 
the rev pat mahoney a south florida coordinator for operation 
rescue an antiabortion group that demonstrates at clinics was 
arrested and charged with assault on a police officer obstructing 
justice without violence and trepassing 
graber called operation rescue a terrorist organization and 
said he will seek a restraining order against the group and damages 
his office has been picketed before but the latest protest was 
perhaps the most strident he said 
graber among many legislators who opposes holding the special 
session said his mail has gone in recent weeks from evenly split 
to mostly antiabortion 
there have been more gory pictures of fetuses and more hate 
mail said graber a germanborn jew offended by packets with 
pictures of hitler and fetuses that contend aborting fetuses is 
comparable to the holocaust 
someone wrote its too bad hitler didnt finish off your 
family he said 
thousands of activists on both sides of the abortion issue are 
flocking here this week but graber is confident legislators will be 
protected by capitol and local police who have set up command 
posts and video monitors and trained a 40member riot squad 
being in the middle of demonstrations isnt the role graber 
wants to play 
id like to be there to cut through the propaganda be 
available to ask questions and answer questions and make sure the 
facts come out in an intelligent manner graber said 
last month he circulated a legislators guide to abortion 
issues graber said his 27page handbook has been positively 
received although antiabortion forces say he shouldnt 
necessarily be considered an expert 
said state rep tom banjanin i think every member of the 
legislature is very knowledgeable on this issue i think abortions 
are the murder of unborn children 
i question whether he can approach this issue objectively 
considering that he has a profit motive involved in what can come 
out of this session added jon johnson political director for 
florida right to life 
graber 41 in practice for 12 years said he initially opposed 
abortions which were illegal when he entered medical school at 
texas tech university 
he said abortions are only a small part of his practice and that 
many are performed on older women whose health could be jeopardized 
by pregnancy 
graber married father of daughters ages 18 17 and 12 years 
has proposed a statewide study panel 
everythings not blackandwhite on this issue he said 
now were talking about a threeday session where were going to 
solve all these complicated questions its unrealistic

the cleveland opera opens its season today not 
with the works of wagner or puccini but with a tale of the crusades 
written by stewart copeland former drummer for the rock group the 
police 
holy blood and crescent moon is bona fide opera a love 
story with arias choruses grandiose sets and sweeping gestures 
drawn from copelands research and observations on holy land 
history and current situation in the middle east 
copeland who spent six years with the police before going on to 
score movies and television shows said monday he doesnt put 
himself in the same league as the masters but did use the qualities 
found in traditional opera 
the music is definitely very brooding he said its very 
bombastic i use the orchestra to its fullest 
the opera which took four years to write is the result of 
copeland making good on a flip remark during a 1984 press 
conference after he had written music for a ballet to shakespeares 
king lear for the san francisco ballet 
when asked when he would write another ballet he said it would 
be after i finish my opera 
the son of cleveland opera general manager david bamberger heard 
that remark and urged his father to commission copeland who had 
ventured from rock music to write scores for the movie 
rumblefish and the tv series the equalizer 
copeland 37 said he knew little about opera when he agreed to 
write one and he had to learn to love the dissonant voices and 
grand drama 
copeland whose father headed the middle east office of the cia 
and who grew up in the region said elements of the same story are 
in the warwracked middle east of recent years 
it tells the tale of edmund prince of the franks and dahlia 
daughter of a palestinian ruler who help each other despite the 
wars their people wage in the name of the land

chinas communist government is holding a big 
bash this year for the 2540th birthday of confucius the 
philosopher once reviled for his reactionary ideas 
the old sage while still taken to task as a father of chinese 
feudalism has now entered the party pantheon as a thinker who 
embodied such socialist virtues as harmony stability and obedience 
new communist party general secretary jiang zemin in a meeting 
with confucian scholars sunday described confucius 551479 bc 
as a great ancient thinker of china 
the official xinhua news agency quoted jiang as adding it is 
necessary to select the essence while discarding the dross from his 
thought the good side of his thought in particular should be 
used to educate the younger generation in helping them inherit and 
carry forward fine national traditions 
some 300 scholars from 20 nations are holding a symposium on 
confucian thought in beijing and confucius birthplace of qufu 300 
miles to the south it is being cosponsored by the un education 
science and culture organization 
an exhibition on confucius life and work also opened at the 
capital museum a former confucian temple sacrificial rites were 
observed the first time beijing has staged a largescale ceremony 
in memory of confucius since the communist takeover in 1949 
qufu is also holding its first confucius cultural festival to 
mark the sept 28 birth of the sage whose ideas on filial piety and 
social order still wield considerable influence in such asian 
countries as south korea singapore and japan 
much of the hoopla has been part of chinas efforts to revive 
its flagging tourist industry and develop qufu as a tourist town 
but it also reflects the new appraisal of the old thinker 
the confucian tenets of loyalty stability sacrificing oneself 
for the social good and obedience to ones masters have won favor 
from the current communist government which is now seeking to 
reassert control after crushing the prodemocracy movement this 
spring 
confucianism which through chinese history gained religious 
status with its own temples was often been a target of chinese 
progressives 
leaders of the may 4th movement of 1919 chinas first 
studentled campaign for democratic reform said it represented 
agrarian feudal values denigrated women and showed excessive 
respect for precedence creating an obstacle to progress 
mao tsetungs revolutionaries with their determination to 
overturn traditional class order rejected confucius while seizing 
the same mandate of heaven the scholar once bestowed on the 
imperial family 
in 1973 the cultural revolution government launched a massive 
anticonfucius antilin biao campaign linking lin maos 
heirapparent who died in a plane crash after failing to 
assassinate mao in 1971 to confucius reactionary ideology 
the movement assailed those trying to restore feudalism 
capitalism and revisionism and accused confucius of advocating 
the establishment of a slave society 
after the 196676 cultural revolution ended confucius was 
rehabilitated 
for centuries people have either exalted and glorified him 
or disparaged and belittled him the official china daily said 
monday in an article on the profound influence of confucian 
ideas on contemporary china 
but none can add to or detract from his position in chinese 
history as an outstanding thinker statesman educator and 
classicist deserving to be called a cultural giant of the world

paul newman is still trim at 64 but 
fans may notice he looks a little thickset in his new movie fat 
man and little boy 
the blueeyed actor wore padding for the role of gen leslie r 
groves the man who brought together the scientists who developed 
the atomic bomb at first newman wore the padding just to appease 
director roland joffe 
but as the filming went on i realized it was working newman 
told reporters after a kansas city screening sunday they say the 
average powerhouse executive is over 6 feet tall and weighs about 
180 pounds i think size and heft contribute something to their 
ability to bulldoze things through and that certainly was a 
quality in groves 
newman said he was a gunner on a bomber off the coast of japan 
during world war ii when he learned about the bomb 
all i knew was that there had been a big explosion he said 
i was just a guy in a war and i didnt have any idea of what it

an unusual autumn rise in retail gasoline 
prices has slowed nearly to a halt because of abundant oil supplies 
and volume discounts to sellers an industry analyst said 
the biweekly lundberg survey of 12000 gasoline stations 
nationwide shows the average price including taxes for all grades 
of gasoline was 10956 a gallon up 013 cent a gallon from two 
weeks earlier 
the usual pattern of rising spring and summer prices with fall 
reductions based on slower consumption was turned on its head this 
year analyst trilby lundberg said sunday 
they rose in spring fell in summer and rose in the fall at 
any rate the situation seems to be returning to normal she said 
rising insurance and other costs to retailers have made it 
important for them to sell in high volume something oil companies 
are pushing by offering volume discounts ms lundberg said 
at selfservice stations the latest lundberg survey shows 
regular leaded at 9687 cents a gallon regular unleaded at 9849 
cents and premium unleaded at 116 
at fullservice pumps regular unleaded was 126 a gallon 
regular unleaded was 127 and premium unleaded was 140

greater gourds 
i spend so much time pampering one plant and it doesnt

pumpkins 
he had sheltered his favored seedling with a tent warmed it 
with a space heater encouraged it with a grow light dumped 1600 
gallons of water on it and monitored it with a thermostat 
the chosen seed turned into a 250pound pumpkin but others on 
davidsons eightacre farm grew larger 
davidson who claims to have the largest selection of giant 
pumpkins for sale in the midwest says its not the first time hes 
been thwarted in his efforts to nurture the biggest pumpkin in the 
world 
one year he paid 5 apiece for seeds from a whopper nova scotia 
parent weighing 644 pounds but the offspring turned out to be 
some sort of mutants and none of them was over 100 pounds 
davidsons biggest pumpkin ever which weighed 347 pounds grew 
on its own one year where a cow yard drains manure and water 
theyre never in any place youd expect them to grow he

nearly five centuries after christopher 
columbus set sail scientists still debate whether european 
explorers unleashed the scourge of syphilis on the americas a 
study says it might have been the other way around 
research by two university of massachusetts anthropologists 
cites studies of skeletal remains that they say show forms of 
syphilis existed in the new world before columbus and his crew 
landed 
in contrast the researchers said studies from the pre1492 old 
world show almost no evidence of syphilis 
doctoral candidate brenda j baker and professor george j 
armelagos base part of their conclusions on an apparent epidemic of 
syphilis in europe in the 1500s 
their research was presented in an article the origin and 
antiquity of syphilis which appeared in a recent issue of 
current anthropology 
an opposing theory holds that venereal syphilis was present in 
europe before it was transported by the explorers to america but 
at the time the disease was not distinguished from leprosy 
another theory suggests the disease has occurred independently 
in both continents 
the massachusetts researchers cite one case of a skull showing 
signs of syphilis from a london cemetery but they note the 
cemetery was used between 1197 and 1537 and it is impossible to 
date the bone exactly 
another case from norway could be precolumbian the researchers 
note raising the possibility that norse explorers brought the 
disease back to their country explorers led by leif ericson are 
acknowledged to have landed in greenland a little more than 500 
years before columbus crossed the atlantic 
syphilis is detected by such marks as lesions on bones and marks 
on skulls baker said it is usually transmitted sexually and if 
untreated it can lead to the degeneration of bones heart and 
nerve tissue 
several skeletons marked by syphilis have been excavated in 
australia but the dating is uncertain the study said a handful of 
possibly precolumbian syphilitic bones have been found in 
southeast asia but that is compared to hundreds of discoveries in 
the americas baker said 
whether a european epidemic of syphilis occurred after the 
sailors return isnt entirely clear baker and armelagos conclude 
it did after reviewing documents studies of bones and numerous 
ordinances passed throughout europe in the late 1490s concerning 
the disease opposing theorists say the outbreak merely reflected 
the recognition that syphilis was distinct from leprosy 
the various explanations of the origin of syphilis have 
fascinated scientists for two reasons sex and politics says al 
b wesolowsky managing editor of the journal of field archeology 
at boston university 
first syphilis is a venereal disease and so anything 
connected with sex often has an interest in and of its own he 
said the question also has political implications in light of a 
growing awareness that native americans see 1492 as an invasion 
that led to their exploitation and devastation by imported diseases 
such as smallpox and tuberculosis he said 
gary kimble executive director of the new yorkbased 
association on american indian affairs said the disease could have 
been circulated from the middle east to europe and from there to 
the americas 
but he professed little interest in the debate and said his 
agency is working on the more pressing issue of halting excavation 
and public display of native americans bones 
kimble said a bigger issue than the origin of syphilis is the 
way columbus travels have been characterized 
the conclusions of the incan and preincan civilizations 
their importance and their sophistication has really been 
minimized he said the incas dominated in peru until the spanish 
conquest 
kimble said there were an estimated 30 million indians in the 
northern hemisphere in 1492 and just 400000 in 1900 
thats the story of columbus he said

policies of the hardline communist government 
they jeer at weekend celebrations marking the states 40th 
anniversary 
in the most dramatic show of public dissatisfaction in more than 
three decades east germans have sent a clear message to the aging 
leadership they want reform and momentum for change is growing 
at least 50000 east germans gave up hope that the orthodox 
communist government was capable of change and have fled west since 
midseptember in the largest such exodus since the berlin wall was 
built in 1961 
for many left behind anger over the governments intolerance of 
change and dissent came into full force as authorities trumpeted 
four decades of achievements in elaborate ceremonies 
public discontent translated into massive street protests in 
east berlin and at least five provincial cities on a scale that 
hadnt been seen since a 1953 workers revolt was crushed by soviet 
tanks 
they east germanys leaders have ignored and underestimated 
just how many people are fed up with this lousy system said a 
30yearold east german woman who asked not to be identified 
because she feared reprisal 
hope for change has taken on new urgency as democratic reform 
sweeps the soviet union poland and hungary east germans hope 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev can help bring change to this 
country of 166 million 
but east german leaders have rejected the need for change and 
routinely suppress fledgling opposition groups prominent 
opposition activists are frequently expelled to west germany 
open dissent has traditionally been suppressed swiftly and 
brutally by security forces but the weekend crushing of street 
protests was the most violent in recent memory 
the only people who are satisfied here are people who reap 
party privileges one man said 
the communist party controls most aspects of everyday life and 
although east germans enjoy a higher standard of living than their 
east bloc neighbors the atmosphere is clouded by gloom and a sense 
of powerlessness 
many complain of the severe restrictions imposed on travel to 
the west even within the east bloc czechoslovakia was the only 
country east germans could travel to freely then last week that 
border was closed 
the mass emigration of east germans that helped stir the recent 
protests is a principal topic of conversation in east berlin 
its not easy to give up everything and leave friends and 
family behind said a 24yearold waitress 
others weigh the achievements in some spheres against life in a 
repressive state 
most east germans would say that they are proud of many of the 
social benefits socialism has brought to the people said a 
27yearold university student referring to free daycare and 
medical treatment 
but a joyless restricted life is the price were paying for 
it 
those who have decided to stay and work for change are buoyed by 
new opposition groups and the spontaneous support for the 
prodemocracy demonstrations 
i still have hope said a 35yearold east berlin man who 
said he was fired from an adminstrative job after openly defending 
a human rights group this is only the beginning

nasa prepared to start the countdown 
for the space shuttle atlantis today despite the promise of 
antinuclear activists to sit on the launch pad if necessary to 
block a payload that carries radioactive plutonium 
pending a federal judges approval atlantis is to lift off at 
129 pm thursday with five astronauts who are to dispatch the 
nuclearpowered galileo spacecraft to explore the planet jupiter 
the national aeronautics and space administration decided to 
begin the count on schedule this morning even though a decision is 
pending on a lawsuit by three citizens groups seeking a temporary 
restraining order to halt the launch the groups contend that an 
explosion on liftoff could spread cancercausing plutonium 
particles over a large area of eastcentral florida 
nasa officials say the two nuclearpowered generators aboard 
galileo have been thoroughly tested and that flying them poses 
minimal health and environmental risks 
us district judge oliver gasch scheduled oral arguments on the 
suit for tuesday in washington 
this is the first time anyone has gone to court to stop a space 
launch 
the space agency said it could stop the countdown at the 11hour 
mark for several days to await the judges decision if necessary 
the activists have said that if they lose in court they will 
attempt to block the flight by infiltrating the launch area 
thursday 
we are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on 
the launch pad said bruce gagnon coordinator for the florida 
coalition for peace and justice one of the groups that filed the 
suit 
more than 200 security guards armed with m16 assault rifles and 
semiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the kennedy space center to 
stop any infiltrators and the center also will be guarded by 
helicopters and boats 
they indicated to us and to the press an intent to do some 
backcountrytype activities to try to stop the launch said gary 
wistrand deputy director of the space centers security office 
we are postured to try to prevent that 
there is only a 10minute launch period available on thursday 
and nasa is concerned the time could be consumed if protesters 
penetrate the launch danger zone with a boat plane or on foot in 
the final minutes of the countdown 
the astronauts who will fly the mission were to arrive here this 
afternoon from their training base in houston all five said they 
are not concerned about flying with plutonium 
i have absolutely no qualms about the devices said 
commander donald williams 
the generators each containing 247 pounds of radioactive 
plutonium238 dioxide were installed sunday in the galileo probe 
stored in atlantis cargo bay 
officials said without nuclear power spacecraft could not 
function at distant planets like jupiter because they are too far 
away to draw energy from the sun 
in a brief filed last week the citizens groups said the 
government underestimated or covered up the danger of plutonium 
contamination from any shuttle explosion like the one that 
destroyed the shuttle challenger in 1986 
nasa responded that the organizations were spreading a tale of 
horrors and that tests show the generators would survive a 
challengerlike explosion 
the agency said similar generators have flown on 22 us space 
vehicles including five manned apollo moon missions and that in 
three instances the wellprotected devices survived severe 
accidents two rocket blowups and a fiery reentry through earths 
atmosphere 
the probability of a release of plutonium in a launching 
accident is less than 1 in 2500 nasa said the opponents put the 
odds at 1 in 430

a case involving an unwitting jailhouse 
confession by a murder suspect could change the scope of the us 
supreme courts miranda ruling on the rights of criminal suspects 
the high court last week agreed to review a ruling by an 
illinois appellate court the state court said the confession 
should be suppressed because it was made before the suspect was 
advised of his right to remain silent and have an attorney both 
guaranteed under the 1966 miranda ruling 
lloyd perkins 24 thought he was confiding in two inmates in a 
county jail in 1986 when he allegedly admitted to a drugrelated 
slaying but one of the inmates was an undercover police 
officer planted in jail to quiz perkins 
prosecutors say the confession is the cornerstone of their 
murder case against perkins who could face the death penalty if 
convicted 
we cant win without it said john baricevic states 
attorney in st clair county 
but the appellate court in a 1988 ruling declared that 
perkins statements were not given through a knowing and 
intelligent waiver of his rights but were in fact the questionable 
product of an intentional subversion of those rights 
the court rejected the prosecutors argument that miranda 
applies only in those situations where a figure of authority 
directly interrogates a suspect 
there is no authority in these circumstances for the police to 
do indirectly what they may not do directly the court said the 
illinois supreme court earlier this year refused to hear the case 
defense attorney dan evers said he doesnt think the us 
supreme courts ruling is likely to have a widespread impact 
nobody has ever tried to any great extent having undercover cops 
in jail he said 
but baricevic said that could change with a favorable supreme 
court ruling he said lawenforcement officials have tended to back 
away from such investigative techniques when they believe they 
already have a strong case against a defendant and dont want to 
jeopardize it 
st clair county authorities had no suspects in the november 
1984 killing of richard stephenson until early 1986 then donald 
charlton an inmate at the graham correctional facility told 
police that perkins had admitted to killing someone in the east st 
louis area two years earlier at the time perkins was the prison 
on a theft charge 
authorities obtained a court order for charltons release from 
prison to assist in their investigation 
in 1986 police planted undercover officer john parisi and 
charlton in the montgomery county jail as escaped convicts perkins 
was at that jail awaiting trial on an unrelated charge 
charlton renewed his acquaintance with perkins and introduced 
him to parisi and the three began plotting an escape according to 
prosecutors 
police said perkins told parisi that a man had paid him 5000 
to cripple stephenson because stephenson owed the man money for 
drugs and had been having an affair with the mans wife court 
documents didnt identify the man who allegedly hired perkins 
prosecutors say the confession should be allowed as evidence 
because perkins could not have thought he was undergoing coercive 
police questioning at the time 
perkins is currently serving a 30year sentence in the menard 
correctional center on an unrelated aggravated battery conviction 
the supreme court ruled in 1980 that law enforcement officials 
cannot hire jailhouse informants to induce criminal defendants in 
custody to make incriminating statements 
the justices in that ruling relied on their own 1964 decision 
handed down two years before miranda that barred government 
agents from eliciting incriminating information from defendants 
entitled to a lawyers help during interrogation

mayor joseph p riley jr was somber as 
the 135mph winds of hurricane hugo roared outside wrenching the 
tin roof off charlestons antebellum city hall 
all we can do now is pray he said quietly to a handful of 
staff and reporters gathered in his candlelit office to ride out 
the storm 
from that dark hour the 46yearold mayor emerged as a symbol 
of the determination with which residents are digging out from the 
sept 21 hurricane the worst storm to hit south carolina in a 
century 
he organized a relief effort which brought tons of supplies and 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to charleston much of which was 
sent to stormravaged areas miles from the city 
he also imposed a curfew to prevent looting and took quick steps 
to prevent price gouging 
he was there the entire time he was in the shelters and he 
was always there with the people said susie crosby a paralegal 
sara joyner an administrative secretary at a law firm agreed 
he was totally in charge she said 
riley worked 18hour days through the cleanup effort and 
fielded hundreds of questions daily from the media he was sharply 
critical of the federal response to the disaster blasting the 
federal emergency management agency for what he said was an 
inadequate response 
fema officials blasted riley back and mark chambers a 
spokesman for gov carroll campbell defended femas efforts 
fema is providing everything the state of south carolina needs 
were talking about one of the most devastating storms in recent 
history its being done he said 
that storm has mostly passed now the mayor is spending much of 
his time urging tourists to return to the 319yearold city he 
said the city has bounced back 
in an interview last week he wore a tshirt proclaiming 
charleston sc going strong scattered around room were 
cards and letters from people moved by charlestons plight 
riley who has served as mayor for more than a decade had urged 
residents a day before hugo struck to evacuate lowlying areas he 
directed his staff to contact mayors of cities hit by hurricanes in 
recent years to pick their minds about preparations 
hurricane hugo toppled dozens of buildings in the city and 
damaged about 80 percent of the roofs but riley said the miracle 
is that so few lives were lost only one in the charleston 
seventeen other deaths across the state were attributed to the 
storm 
this hurricane had blood on its mind riley said 
throughout the ordeal riley said his most enduring impression 
of the storm was the courage of his fellow charlestonians 
people who lost homes say theyre lucky to be alive people 
who lost a roof say theyre lucky to have a house the people are 
courageous and thankful and spirited the mayor said

police found the bulletriddled body of 
the medellin army commanders private secretary stashed in a car 
just hours after the president swore in a new justice minister and 
two other cabinet officers 
nury velasquez de vasquez was kidnapped friday in medellin 
colombias cocaine center and her body was found sunday 10 miles 
to the northwest in marinilla no group claimed responsibility for 
the slaying 
the medellin army brigade has been active in confiscating 
properties allegedly belonging to traffickers the confiscations 
are part of the governments 2monthold crackdown on the countrys 
cocaine barons 
colombias new justice minister roberto salazar manrique is 
the ninth to serve under president virgilio barco he was sworn in 
along with interior minister carlos lemos simmonds and 
communications minister enrique danies rincones 
salazar a graduate of notre dame university replaces monica de 
greiff 32 who resigned after death threats from drug traffickers 
during the 70 days she served in office 
shortly after taking office salazar told reporters he did not 
fear traffickers who are thought to have killed former justice 
minister rodrigo lara bonilla in 1984 
he reiterated his pledge to carry out firmly and fairly the 
extradition of colombian drug suspects to the united states where 
many face trafficking and moneylaundering charges 
in colombia drug barons have operated with relative impunity by 
paying off or intimidating judges 
the new justice minister faces the difficult task of pushing 
forward the unprecedented government crackdown which barco 
declared a day after traffickers assassinated the leading 
presidential contender 
in retaliation traffickers declared war on the government 
since midaugust 148 bombings and arson attacks have killed 10 
people and injured 164 in bogota the capital and medellin 
in commencing the crackdown barco issued emergency decrees 
allowing the extradition of cocaine barons and the seizure of their 
property 
he has said he will not negotiate with traffickers who want to 
hold talks with the government on its new extradition policy 
but in newspaper interviews published sunday a former interior 
minister said he carried messages from the medellin cartel the 
worlds largest drug trafficking organization to a top aide to 
barco 
the el tiempo newspaper quoted joaquin vallejo as saying that 
although there were no direct negotiations the presidents general 
secretary german montoya did not discourage indirect contacts 
with traffickers 
vallejo said montoya who apparently acted on orders from barco 
was willing to consider negotiations if the united states agreed to 
participate us government opposition made talks impossible 
vallejo said 
in a communique montoya said his decision to meet with vallejo 
was a personal one and that he told the former interior minister a 
dialogue between the government and the cartel was impossible 
also sunday an explosion and fire killed seven people and 
injured eight on a bogota bus police initially said they thought 
it was caused by an incendiary bomb but later said that theory was 
in question 
the radio network caracol quoted a policeman at the scene as 
saying the fire originated from a fivegallon plastic container 
filled with gasoline that had been carried by a passenger 
three children were among the victims who struggled in vain to 
climb out of the burning bus police said

wildlife specialists have squared 
off for a bitter fight over how to keep africas endangered 
elephant population from vanishing forever into ivory piano keys 
and chess pieces 
delegates from more than 100 countries will meet through oct 20 
at the biennial conference of the convention on international trade 
in endangered species of wild fauna and flora there were strategy 
sessions sunday but the conference formally opens today 
although they will also consider the smoothcoated otter the 
salmoncrested cockatoo and a noahs ark of other species 
attention is focused on pachyderms and their valuable ivory 
by some reckoning the great lumbering african elephant for 
many an unmatchable symbol of the wild will survive mainly in zoos 
by the turn of the century 
when we talk about halving the population in 10 years were 
talking about disaster iain douglashamilton a widely respected 
expert said in an interview from kenya 
david western of wildlife conservation international who 
commissioned the last census said numbers are dropping so fast 
elephants may be exterminated in most areas within 20 or 30 years 
overall he said just more than 600000 remain in africa 
compared to estimates ranging from 13 million to 4 million a 
decade ago each year poachers kill at least 70000 often 
spraying gunfire at females and calves along with the few old 
tuskers left 
in kenya alone fewer than 17000 are left of the 165000 
elephants counted in 1970 
the conventions rulings become nonlegally binding agreements 
that rely on international pressure for enforcement a convention 
member may abstain from a resolution but risks being branded an 
environmental bad guy 
delegates must find common ground between the east african 
demand for an ivory ban backed by the united states and western 
europe and southern africas push for trade in culled tusks 
zimbabwe south africa and botswana argue that careful 
management has increased their herds and that ivory finances 
antipoaching measures 
we have a very healthy elephant population that must be culled 
or it will simply destroy its own environment bosman olivier of 
south africas department for environmental affairs said in 
johannesburg 
zimbabwe earns 9 million a year by selling ivory from herds 
estimated at 52000 
you dont ban something valuable you protect it said 
ingrid schroeder of the save endangered african wildlife which 
works in zimbabwe 
william nduku zimbabwes director of parks and wildlife said 
its not fair to treat africa as if it was a small country 
but a broad coalition of experts and environmentalists 
including greenpeace and the humane society of the united states 
say that exceptions to a ban leave doors wide open to abuse 
these arguments are based on a pack of lies the numbers the 
level of poaching and the ability to control trade said craig 
van note of the washingtonbased monitor consortium 
elephants and poachers ignore orders experts say and trade in 
wildlife products is as hard to control as drug trafficking 
documents are easy to falsify 
for example burundi lost its last elephant an old bull years 
ago but officials there have managed to export up to 100 tons per 
year of ivory 
in 1986 the convention granted a blanket amnesty to 89 tons of 
ivory in burundi as the start of an african quota system since 
then convention officials admit another 87 tons of ivory the 
tusks of nearly 15000 elephants have appeared in the nation 
the ban lobby is countered by wellfunded traders mostly based 
in hong kong who fear an end to a billiondollar industry in 
carvings jewelry and personalized name stamps used widely in japan 
african elephants fall under the conventions appendix two for 
threatened species controlled trade is allowed in that category 
shifting them to appendix one endangered species would mean a ban 
eugene lapointe secretarygeneral of the convention has 
recommended a splitlisting placing elephants on appendix one but 
allowing those countries with controlled legal trade to continue 
he said a total ban might force some member countries to declare 
reservations allowing them to bypass convention guidelines 
western said he favors a ban but with accommodation for southern 
africa under strict control he is working on a method of tracing 
tusks based on genetic fingerprinting 
but many specialists express concern that complex exceptions 
could lead to the end of elephants in the wild 
experts note the southern africa group includes mozambique and 
angola where lingering civil wars have decimated wildlife 
mozambican rebels and zambian poachers frequently penetrate zambian 
reserves 
cynthia moss author of elephant memories said zambia is 
wearing blinders they cannot stop the poaching 
van note testified before the us congress last year that 
poaching is rampant in parts of southern africa a few recent 
incidents suggest serious problems 
last month south african newspapers reported a plane that 
crashed on takeoff from an angola rebel camp was overloaded with 
ivory the portuguese pilot joaquim augusto owned a truck found 
earlier in namibia with 7 tons of tusks 
the plane was carrying three portuguese legislators including 
joao soares son of president mario soares who had visited the 
headquarters of the national union for the total independence of 
angola or unita soares was badly injured 
last year after us groups accused pretoria of helping unita 
finance its rebellion by trafficking ivory a south african board 
of inquiry denied any largescale military involvement but the 
board said the army did help unita transport tusks from 1976 to 
1979 
two south african army officers were among six people indicted 
last year in connecticut on charges of smuggling rhino horn skins 
of endangered animals and assault rifles into the united states

a plan designed to elect more black judges 
has failed in part because of voter concern over a grandfather 
clause that would have protected the jobs of mostly white 
incumbents analysts said 
bill quigley an attorney for blacks who challenged the current 
election systems said sunday voters didnt support the proposals 
because there are people in the state not interested in 
providing equal opportunity to black candidates 
in addition he said those no votes were joined by 
people who are interested in giving opportunity to black 
candidates but are not interested in giving special opportunities 
to white male incumbents 
two proposed constitutional amendments one dealing with the 
louisiana supreme court and another covering district and appellate 
judges were turned down overwhelmingly in every parish 
the proposals received the most negative votes among 13 
constitutional amendments decided saturday the supreme court plan 
was rejected by 69 percent of the voters while 70 percent opposed 
the other plan in heavily black orleans parish the propositions 
failed by 31 margins the secretary of state said only 31 percent 
of the registered voters cast ballots 
there were no major campaigns either for or against the 
propositions 
a couple of other items on the ballot fared better 
voters overwhelmingly approved a 4cent boost in gasoline taxes 
to finance a 14 billion highway improvement program a special 
fund for coastal restoration projects and a tough property 
confiscation measure aimed at drug dealers 
the judicial propositions were drawn up by the legislature in 
response to two suits alleging that the current election system for 
judges illegally dilutes black voting strength 
voter rejection probably will result in federal courts carving 
out new plans quigley said 
gov buddy roemer said sunday he would meet with judges in hopes 
that the system can be revised without federal intervention 
currently there are no black supreme court justices there is 
one black among the states 52 appellate court judges and five 
black district judges out of 192 
us district judge john parker of baton rouge ordered a new 
system for district and appellate court judges although us 
district judge charles schwartz of new orleans upheld the current 
supreme court system the decision is being appealed 
under the legislatures plan additional district and appellate 
judgeships would have been carved from election districts although 
the judges would be elected on a subdistrict basis they would have 
served the entire district 
also 35 district and appellate judges who would be displaced by 
the new plans could opt for senior status under which they would 
keep their jobs at full pay for eight to 10 years 
i think the creation of senior judges was instrumental in 
the defeat said ed renwick a veteran louisiana political analyst 
the people arent going to fund that in an era where the funds 
arent available for the basics 
according to legislative estimates the plans would have cost an 
additional 55 million over the next two years

voter turnout isnt likely to be very good in 
riveredge township next month ballots will be printed and a 
polling place has been designated but no one lives there anymore 
unless we hear from the courts or some other governmental body 
that it no longer exists we still maintain it as a voting place 
said laura jones spokeswoman for the cuyahoga county board of 
elections 
the township is adjacent to cleveland hopkins international 
airport and once was the site of a 256home trailer park the last 
resident left in 1986 
i lived there my parents lived there and my grandparents 
lived there but there isnt any town there anymore said jack 
ullrich who now lives in cleveland 
the ballot will have four spots three for township trustees 
and one for township clerk where the words no candidate filed 
for this position will be printed 
ms jones said election records showed the township has seven 
registered voters all of whom either have died or moved away 
without notifying the board since 1985 the last time someone in 
riveredge actually voted 
it is bizzare but we have to go through the motions she 
told the cleveland plain dealer 
ms jones said the cost of holding the election will be minimal 
weve put the polling place in conjunction with a cleveland 
precinct so we dont have to hire separate booth officials for 
riveredge she said provided anybody shows up they will of 
course take care of the voters but we kind of figure that 
cleveland precinct can handle it 
although riveredge is empty its far from a dead issue 
cleveland and the suburb of fairview park are battling in the 
courts to get control of the ghost township 
fairview park would like to build a hightech office park there 
cleveland hopes to extend a runway at hopkins onto riveredges 
land both sides would like the approximately 270000 in income 
tax revenue generated at the nasa lewis research center which 
rests within riveredges boundaries 
last week the 8th ohio district court of appeals voided an 
annexation proceeding undertaken by fairview park last year 
throwing the 6yearold case back to cuyahoga county common pleas 
court 
riveredge was little more than several scattered homes a few 
small shops and the trailer park in 1983 when neighboring cleveland 
announced plans to expand a runway at hopkins 
fairview park opposed the plan which would bring more air 
traffic over the western suburbs and it offered annexation to 
riveredge but residents voted against that offer in 1984 
most residents began moving out after cleveland bought the 
privately owned trailer park in may 1984 and offered residents 
money to relocate

the dollar fell slightly against the japanese yen 
today contributing to a gain by the tokyo stock exchanges main 
index 
the dollar closed at 14223 yen down 022 yen from its close of 
14245 yen last friday when it rose 140 yen the dollar opened 
today at 14160 yen its low for the day and ranged as high as 
14228 yen 
currency dealers said the dollars decline followed a washington 
labor department report on friday that the us unemployment rate 
rose to 53 percent in september from 52 percent in july and 
august 
they said this might encourage the federal reserve board to 
lower interest rates which would tend to make the dollar less 
attractive to foreign investors 
but a dealer at daiichi kangyo bank said the dollar was expected 
to keep its strength in the long run 
now that the incentive to buy the dollar is calming down it 
is uncertain whether the bank of japan will continue to put upward 
pressure on japanese interest rates said the dealer on 
condition of anonymity 
he said the announcement of the latest us consumer price index 
later this week likely will give the market a direction 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues a 31364point loser on friday regained 16700 points or 
047 percent closing at 3537635 
securities dealers attributed the rebound to the dollar easing 
against the japanese yen 
investors were reacting favorably to the strengthening of the 
yen today said a dealer at nikko securities co on condition of 
anonymity 
another dealer said the environment is sound but with a 
national holiday the next day we cant really expect much market 
activity today 
volume traded on the first section of the exchange where major 
shares are listed was estimated at 700 million shares 
banks government offices foreign exchange and stock markets 
and many businesses will be closed tuesday for sports day a 
national holiday in japan

cappele new brunswick ap a logging truck crashed into a 
wagon that was taking relatives at a family reunion on a hayride 
killing 12 people and injuring 45 many of whom were pinned or 
crushed by logs witnesses said 
several of those injured in sundays crash were in critical 
condition and five of the dead were children according to a 
hospital spokesmen in moncton 25 miles west of cormier where the 
accident occurred 
about 50 people were involved in sundays outing part of a 
traditional family reunion in cormier each canadian thanksgiving 
weekend most were riding on the haycovered wagon which was being 
towed by a tractor when it was hit 
others were traveling behind in two pickup trucks both of which 
were also hit by the logging truck one tipped over and dumped its 
riders into a ditch 
the logs ended up on the people when the truck failed to 
negotiate the curve on a twolane highway said a local resident 
gerry leblanc 
edmond leger another local resident said the tractortrailor 
jackknifed and fell on the haycovered wagon he said one man lost 
three members of his immediate family 
the worst thing was that it happened only about 100 yards from 
the hall where the family reunion was being held said val gogen 
who works at a gas station in cormier 
stricken family members many in tears stumbled around the 
accident site desperately looking for relatives a police officer 
said

its a terrible thing because everybody knows everybody around 
here said cecile cormier an ambulance worker they celebrate

city and civil rights leaders lauded an 
antidiscrimination housing settlement but they disagreed on 
bostons progress in overcoming the racial strife that flared in 
the mid1970s with courtordered busing 
the settlement announced last week stemmed from a 1988 suit 
filed by the national association for the advancement of colored 
people it alleged that more than 2000 minority families were 
discouraged from applying for housing in predominantly white 
developments or were denied such housing 
the agreement provides up to 2500 for families who were passed 
over it also affirms a housing plan adopted last year to give 
priority to those who were discriminated against in tenant 
selection 
in addition a community benefit fund estimated at 
500000 will supply grants to encourage integration and 
multicultural activities in the citys public housing developments 
naacp officials said the settlement was a landmark agreement 
since those who suffered discrimination will receive financial 
compensation 
it was designed to show that if you do wrong youre going to 
pay for it said benjamin hooks the national executive director 
of the naacp 
mayor raymond flynn said the pact would end a painful era 
this is the last barrier that remains that goes back to the 
turbulent 1970s and 80s flynn said hopefully this will wipe 
the slate clean and everyone will be on a level playing field for 
housing 
but others said the legacy of bostons racially troubled past 
when the city erupted in violence over school desegregation was 
still alive just not as obvious 
what youre having is fewer rocks being thrown and there 
arent demonstrations and rhetoric but underneath it all there 
still is the cause said mel king a back leader and professor of 
community development at the massachusetts institute of technology 
hooks said the root cause for housing inequity is pure and 
simple racism 
he added id like to think there was a change of heart but 
that i dont know but at least in boston theyre willing to uphold 
the law 
flynn said much of the housing problems can be blamed on the 
failure to implement a policy adopted in 1978 that was intended to 
provide open housing for minorities 
officials did not follow through on the policy he said 
because they could not ensure the safety of minorities moving 
into neighborhoods 
just four years earlier the busing of black students into 
predominantly white south boston prompted protests rock throwing 
and the flight of white students to private schools 
dianne wilkerson head of the housing committee for the local 
naacp agreed with city officials who said peoples attitudes 
toward racial issues seemed to have changed 
she said under the remedial housing arrangement affirmed in the 
settlement blacks have been moving into predominantly white 
housing projects since last year and those people are living a 
peaceful existence

members of a latvian nationalist movement 
have voted nearly unanimously to work to achieve not just autonomy 
but outright independence from the soviet union 
delegates at the second annual congress of the peoples front of 
latvia voted late sunday to approve a program aimed at preparing 
for independence though without specifying just when that might 
come 
there was only one vote against the 126point program from the 
1074 delegates who carefully discussed the nuances of each clause 
in a debate that stretched into early today 
the vice chairman of the latvian state planning commission said 
the independence call could create problems in negotiating more 
economic freedom from the kremlin 
there is a direct link between the political situation and 
economic negotiations janis aboltins said the more radical 
the slogans the more difficult it is for us the day after in the 
corridors of power in moscow 
however sundays debate was fairly free of the fiery rhetoric 
that would upset moscow bureaucrats he said 
the program calls for human rights competing political parties 
and private business in a freemarket economy it is designed to 
build an independent economy and social structure before the 
republic secedes 
on the autonomy clause the delegates approved a declaration 
saying the fronts goal is to restore the independence of the 
latvian state by creating a democratic parliamentary republic 
latvias social and political life has changed radically 
the draft said the possibility actually exists that an 
independent latvia can be renewed through nonviolent means 
the soviet union annexed latvia and its baltic neighbors 
lithuania and estonia in 1940 in the past year movements for 
autonomy have gained strength in all three republics which have 
adopted measures calling for greater freedom from the kremlin 
latvias parliament has voted itself the right to veto soviet 
laws made latvian the official language and restored schools for 
ethnic minorities 
the peoples front has gained the support of a leading 
communist latvian premier vilnisedvins bresis 
he told the congress it should strive for real power for the 
people with the fate of our native latvia determined and governed 
by the latvian people 
bresis said he believed the republics most urgent task is 
wresting control of the latvian economy from moscow he did not 
explicitly back independence 
he also warned that latvias reforms must not move too far ahead 
of countrywide efforts to overhaul the economy and political 
system championed by president mikhail s gorbachev 
the peoples front claims 300000 members among the baltic 
republics 27 million people 
its program was carefully worded to ensure wide support 
the congress dropped a direct complaint about the communist 
party and wording that could have been interpreted as a threat to 
voting rights of russian and other nonlatvian immigrants who 
comprise half of the population

the attack prompted an immediate outcry from community leaders 
they came out of a fraternity party and were set upon by about 
15 white youths who called them names and then beat the daylights 
out of them said city councilman noach dear of brooklyn

new weapons and equipment have given the soviet 
union an edge in tank forces that has allowed it to withdraw 
thousands of older tanks from the front line facing nato a new 
study said today 
the soviets no longer need so many tanks because their latest 
models are superior in some cases to those of the west in armor 
mobility and firepower said christopher f foss editor of the 
19891990 edition of the respected janes armor and artillery 
foss wrote in his foreword to the volume describing the worlds 
armored vehicles and towed guns that the past year was dominated by 
the soviet decision to withdraw some of its conventional forces 
from eastern europe without waiting for similar concessions from 
nato 
he said that what many observers failed to realize was that the 
quality of soviet tanks had become superior 
the introduction of the t64 t72 and t80 main battle tanks 
gave the soviet union a quantum leap in that they introduced new 
tanks with significant improvements in armor mobility and 
firepower over their earlier t54 t55 and t62 tanks foss said 
no nato main battle tank has automatic gunloading which all 
three new soviet tanks have enabling them to carry as few as three 
crewmen the editor said 
fire control systems for armored fighting vehicles throughout 
the warsaw pact have also been improved with a laser rangefinder 
replacing optical systems to give gunners a greater chance of 
hitting a target on the first shot he said 
new armor on soviet tanks has made the vehicles virtually 
immune to penetration by shells from any nato tank foss said 
the soviet tank fleet consists of well over 50000 vehicles of 
some five basic types excluding heavy tanks and world war ii 
vehicles still held in reserve the editor said

most workers who take up an offer of early 
retirement from their bosses are happy with their decisions 
according to a new study 
the bottom line of early retirement is that if youre in good 
health and have enough financial resources to keep you going 
youre likely to be happy in retirement said thomas blank 
associate professor of human development and family relations at 
the university of connecticut 
blank and two researchers at lehigh university in pennsylvania 
robert williamson a professor of social relations and alice 
rinehart a professor of education surveyed 115 recent retirees 
they had planned to study the problems people had when they took 
early retirement like alcoholism depression and boredom but 
say they had trouble finding anybody who was miserable 
fifty percent of those surveyed were very satisfied in 
retirement while 15 percent were dissatisfied the rest were as 
happy as when they held their job 
the unhappy retirees tended to feel theyd been forced out by an 
employer who no longer wanted them blank said in a recent 
interview 
the researchers advertised in a bethlehem pa newspaper for 
recent retirees to participate in the survey and collected data 
for three years from 1986 to 1988 they are continuing to analyze 
data and looking for a publisher 
ironically williamson and rinehart have retired since the study 
began 
respondents said the thing they missed most about work was 
feeling useful and having a sense of responsibility 
but blank said most respondents found other channels for those 
needs about half do volunteer work and 40 percent work parttime 
many as consultants for their former employers 
the average age of those surveyed was 59 seventy percent had 
planned to retire between the ages of 60 and 65 most had worked 
for the same employer for the last 25 to 30 years in jobs ranging 
from highlevel managers to administrative assistants 
corporations started using early retirement as a way to save 
money in the late 1970s and early 1980s when they discovered they 
were topheavy with managers earning hefty salaries blank said 
since then a number of states have followed the private 
sectors lead 
walt mcgowan 62 spent more than two decades in the university 
of connecticuts public relations office he thought hed retire at 
age 65 
but the state struggling to help close an 800 million budget 
gap made mcgowan and other workers an offer if they opted for 
early retirement theyd receive a bonus and medical benefits 
i thought putting all these things together would probably be 
to my benefit and to my familys benefit said mcgowan who has 
made two picnic tables redone a bathroom refinished some 
furniture and written longoverdue thankyou notes in the month 
since he left work 
i did it i left sept 1 and i love it he said

police were searching for vandals who 
left behind a trail of antisemitic and racist graffiti through 
several miles of this suburban town

like to think everyone gets along said detective jim fitzgerald 
the vandalism occurred late saturday or early sunday the eve of 
yom kippur the jewish day of atonement 
officer joseph collari said vandals spraypainted swastikas and 
racial slurs on a downtown building mailboxes garages homes and 
cars across a twotothreemile stretch of this town west of boston 
weve had probably 40 to 50 separate complaints come in on 
this already collari said 
investigators photographed the graffiti and interviewed 
residents sunday but had no suspects

atop the agenda for officials from 39 countries 
gathered to map antarcticas future is the question of whether to 
leave the vast continent in pristine splendor or mine it for 
mineral wealth 
the biennial review of the 1959 antarctica treaty which opens 
today will also consider issues such as the disposal of hazardous 
wastes and controlling the wave of tourists visiting the continent 
but the question of whether to allow mining on the frozen 
continent is expected to be the most vigorously debated 
australia and france whose policies have changed to reflect 
growing public concern for the environment are pitted in the 
dispute against countries such as the united states and japan that 
generally favor regulated exploitation 
in the past 15 months australia and france have reversed their 
positions on an international convention reached in wellington new 
zealand that would open antarctica to carefully regulated mining 
thirtythree of the 39 nations adhering to the antarctica treaty 
initialed the accord in june 1988 
mining in antarctica is not compatible with protection of the 
fragile antarctic environment premier michel rocard of france 
and australian prime minister bob hawke said in a joint statement 
issued aug 18 
because the wellington convention required unanimous agreement 
their decision torpedoed the accord for the foreseeable future 
the decision by france a country not known for its 
environmental policies was a surprise to many diplomats but 
french officials said president francois mitterrand has realized 
that environmental problems such as global warming and the thinning 
of the earths ozone shield require a global response 
the mounting concern about the environment is indisputable 
one foreign ministry official said in a background briefing we 
feel it here in france and our partners undoubtedly feel it as 
well 
some countries such as the united states fear the collapse of 
the wellington convention will weaken the good will among nations 
that has kept the continent at the foot of the world a place of 
peace and scientific cooperation 
a voluntary moratorium on mineral exploitation remains in place 
and few diplomats said they were worried about a rush to dig and 
drill in the absence of the convention 
to fill the legal void australia and france have proposed that 
antarctica be declared a wilderness park where mining would be 
prohibited and other human activity carefully controlled 
this ambitious proposal which was to be debated in the 
corridors during the 10day paris meeting has the support of 
belgium and india australian diplomats said italy also has voted 
to not sign the minerals convention 
the us position is shared by new zealand chile and japan 
which is heavily dependent on foreign oil imports these countries 
say the stringent controls in the mining convention assure the 
protection of wildlife habitat and marine resources 
this agreement establishes environmental principles which are 
very important said the state departments tucker scully head 
of the us delegation 
besides he said the us is not a singleinterest 
constituency there are economic interests who say we are not 
interested in mining now but we cannot exclude the possibility 
these interests are politically significant 
scully said that deciding antarcticas future on the basis of 
emotions rather than facts is a bad precedent 
but environmentalists say the us position may be in flux 
they point to a resolution introduced last week by sen albert 
gore dtenn to prevent ratification of the minerals accord 
congress is responding to a shift in american attitudes on 
the environment said james barnes director of the antarctic and 
southern oceans coalition id say the administration is out of 
touch 
the us attitude toward development in the antarctic may be 
influenced by the recent oil spill in alaska that fouled the 
states pristine coastline nearly 11 million gallons of oil 
spilled from the exxon valdez after it ran aground on a reef march 
24 shortly after the tanker pulled out of the harbor at valdez 
alaska the southern terminal of the transalaska pipeline 
the united states hopes australia and france will change their 
position on mining in antarctica but the two countries have their 
own plans 
we will go slowly rocard told the french news magazine 
lexpress in august these ideas have to incubate a little while 
for there to be a meeting of the minds

two burmese students who hijacked an 
aircraft to demand democracy in their militaryruled country will 
be tried in thailand and not sent back to their homeland a senior 
thai official said today 
deputy prime minister tienchai sirisunpan told a news conference 
that while they faced a maximum penalty of death he expected the 
two students who hijacked a domestic burmese flight on friday 
would be dealt with leniently 
we will not send them back to burma said tienchai who 
persuaded the hijackers to give up peacefully after they diverted 
the plane to thailand where the 83 people they had held hostage 
were released unharmed after more than 10 hours of negotiations 
tienchai said the students identified as ye tin 21 and ye 
thi ha 25 could not request political asylum in thailand or any 
other country until after legal proceedings against them are 
completed 
the students who initially threatened to blow up the plane with 
a homemade explosive demanded a return of democracy to burma and 
the freeing of all political prisoners 
tienchai said the antiterrorist committee he heads was very 
sympathetic to the two students but added that we cant ignore 
what they have done 
he said the two have been charged with criminal acts related to 
hijacking under both thai law and three international conventions 
which thailand has signed the deputy prime minster said they would 
be handed over by the thai navy to police in sattahip on tuesday 
sattahip located southeast of bangkok is near a 
navycontrolled air base to which the hijacked plane was flown the 
plane has since returned to burma 
a burmese student rebel group said today that they had received 
a letter from the democratic fighting force of burma which claimed 
responsibility for the hijacking and asked the group to support the 
two student hijackers 
the all burma students democratic front said it received the 
letter on saturday the front said the democratic fighting force of 
burma was founded in rangoon in april but that but little else was 
known about it 
the front is the major representative of students who fled the 
burmese interior to fight for democracy from camps along the 
countrys borders 
it has denied involvement in the hijacking but expressed 
sympathy with the hijackers aims 
a massive prodemocracy uprising in burma was brutally crushed 
in september 1988 following months of demonstrations and violence 
a military junta wields martial law in the country today and has in 
recent months arrested several thousand dissidents according to 
western diplomats in rangoon

azerbaijani railroad crews stopped desperately needed supplies from 
reaching rival armenia in the latest episode of a dispute over 
territory both republics claim 
azerbaijani activist shahin gadzhiev saidour drivers are 
striking and demanding guarantees of their safety in response to 
gunfire and stoning attacks on trains late saturday in armenia 
about 400 trains with a total of 60000 cars have been reported 
idled on main lines in the southwestern region there were 
conflicting reports over how much food fuel and building supplies 
managed to reach the armenian republic 
the republics are feuding over nagornokarabakh a fertile 
predominantly armenian enclave that has been part of 
moslemdominated azerbaijan since 1923

between the feuding caucasus republics troops moved in to protect 
the trains and soviet media said friday that the twomonth 
blockade that crippled armenia was over members of the azerbaijani 
peoples front denied that train traffic was halted sunday 
the trains are running but the attacks on them are also 
continuing adel mamedov said in an interview from the 
azerbaijani capital of baku 
but tass reported late sunday that 37 trains were dispatched 
from azerbaijan to armenia over the past day and a half and 
extremist forces are still hindering the normal functioning of 
the route 
in the nagornokarabakh region five people were wounded in 
clashes tass reported sunday 
mutual hostility blinds the participants of the conflict with 
dark malice and suppresses their reason tass said

faced food and fuel shortages he said the few shipments making it 
through to armenia were sabotaged and contained either damaged 
materials or cisterns filled with water instead of fuel 
everything that arrived is no good he said in an interview 
from the armenian capital of yerevan that the blockade was 
stopped at all is a myth 
about 80 percent of armenian rail traffic runs through 
azerbaijan 
the azerbaijani blockade has virtually halted reconstruction

the fbi has begun running daily ads in novoye russkoye slovo or 
new russian word asking readers to tell the bureau what they know 
about soviet spies operating here and abroad the new york times 
reported today 
replies will be kept in the strictest confidence the ad 
states 
the fbi has received six calls since the first ad ran friday but 
would not disclose what the callers said the times said 
james fox director of the new york fbi office told the times 
the ad is designed to capitalize on the influx of about 150000 
soviet emigres since 1975 about 50000 emigres settled in the new 
york area 
the american intelligence community has always presumed that the 
soviet union smuggled in agents along with the emigres and the 
newspaper ads are aimed at catching those spies according to the 
times 
fbi officials also want to collect information about soviet 
criminal gangs that operate in the emigre community especially in 
the brighton beach section of brooklyn the times said 
the ads which are costing the fbi 300 a day are scheduled to 
run daily for two weeks and then appear intermittently the fbi

east german authorities tried and sentenced to 
jail many of the hundreds of protesters arrested during weekend 
antigovernment demonstrations in a halfdozen cities west german 
television said today 
meanwhile east germany began letting western tourists back into 
east berlin after keeping them out since thursday during ceremonies 
marking the states 40th anniversary west berlin officials said 
on sunday riot police used clubs and dogs to attack thousands 
of demonstrators rallying for democratic reform outside an east 
berlin church in a second day of protests against their communist 
governments intransigence 
the peaceful protesters shouted we want freedom and no 
violence as security forces broke up a sitin after a vigil at 
the protestant gethsemane church beating demonstrators and chasing 
them into side streets 
police seized between 30 and 100 people according to hessische 
rundfunk radio in frankfurt several people were injured 
the latest arrests came after hundreds were detained in protests 
saturday in east berlin leipzig dresden jena potsdam and 
plauen some estimates put the number arrested at more than 1000 
in east berlin alone 
many of those arrested have been given summary trials and 
sentenced to prison terms of up to six months west germanys ard 
television said today it did not give a more precise estimate 
ard said demonstrations had also occurred in karlmarx stadt 
east german officials gave no reports of arrests or injuries 
as it marks its 40th anniversary east germany is in the throes 
of the most serious street demonstrations since soviet tanks and 
troops put down a workers revolt in 1953 
this time however the demonstrators are looking to the soviet 
union as a model of liberal reform 
on sunday west german television showed soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev saying that many east germans have strong 
sympathy for his liberalizing of the soviet political system and 
economy 
he said democratic changes in the communist world were the main 
topic of his talks saturday with east germanys 77yearold 
hardline leader erich honecker gorbachev returned to moscow 
saturday after spending two days in east berling for anniversary 
celebrations 
sunday nights violence in east berlin began when riot police 
beat protesters as they left the church where about 5000 people 
had gathered for a vigil 
after negotiations between church officials and police most 
protesters left but some joined 2000 others who were staging a 
sitin nearby on schoenhauser allee street 
police used clubs and trucks with steelmesh barriers welded to 
the front to chase the protesters into side streets witnesses said 
one man who watched the violence from his apartment window said 
its getting worse and worse someday soon rocks and molotov 
cocktails are going to fly 
east germanys official adn news agency accused western news 
media of aiding the weekend protests calling the demonstrators 
troublemakers 
authorities refused to renew the visas of dozens of western 
journalists who were in east berlin for the anniversary 
festivities reporters were told to leave the city when their visas 
expired at midnight sunday 
west germanys zdf television network on sunday showed an 
interview that gorbachev apparently gave soviet television 
immediately after his meeting with honecker 
after many talks i have the impression that the german 
democratic republics citizens the veterans the middleaged and 
especially the young have strong sympathy for our perestroika 
policy he said referring to the soviet unions reform program 
these are fiery fans there is strong support 
east germans are considering what to change and improve not 
only in the economy and in social respects but also in the 
political and societal institutions gorbachev was quoted as 
saying 
gorbachevs reform policies have made him popular among many 
east germans protesters chanted his name and called for his 
support during his visit 
the anniversary celebrations were to illustrate the success of 
communism in east germany which despite being a tightly controlled 
society is in better economic shape than its east bloc partners 
instead world attention focused on the protests which were in 
part stirred by an exodus of about 50000 disgruntled east germans 
through czechoslovakia poland and hungary since sept 10 when 
budapest opened its border with austria 
despite the growing unrest and exodus to the west honecker 
reportedly told gorbachev he would stick to his conservative course 
hundreds of injuries were reported as police swinging truncheons 
repeatedly charged demonstrators in the capital saturday and early 
sunday 
police punched kicked beat and dragged away the protesters 
roughing up western journalists as well at least two western 
reporters were detained in separate incidents for six hours 
also sunday activists demanding reform said they had formed a 
social democratic party to promote a rigorous democratization of 
state and society the partys charter was signed by 43 people in 
schwante near berlin 
the communist government recently banned a prominent reform 
group new forum the group says its membership has grown from the 
original 30 members to more than 11000

it smells just like a babys dirty pants really said marie 
mcnairn a member of the friends of dorsch library i smelled it 
for years 
since 1865 a ginkgo has been standing in front of the dorsch 
library in this town 30 miles southwest of detroit 
the female tree which originates from eastern china bears an 
edible fruit whose hull emits a strong odor into the fall air 
monroes annual ginkgo mania festival which began last week 
includes a contest to determine what day the dorsch trees leaves 
will fall ginkgoes shed their leaves in a matter of hours 
robert peven a monroe county planning department employee by 
day but a ginkgo maniac by night tried to write a poem about the 
ginkgo but gave up after realizing the only rhyming word is stinko

the leaked lists was assassinated aug 25 and two members of the 
regiment have been charged in his slaying the killing was claimed 
by the ulster freedom fighters an outlawed protestant group which 
claimed maginn was in the ira 
sundays arrests came after an inquiry by john stevens a 
regional police chief brought in from england his probe was 
triggered by the ulster freedom fighters giving security details of 
maginn and other persons to the press 
a british soldier brought from his base in dortmund west 
germany has already been charged with leaking information 
early today a man was killed by a gunman who pulled up 
alongside him in a car and shot him at pointblank range police

an air force jet plunged to earth and 
exploded during an air show after the pilot apparently misjudged 
his altitude and tried an extra maneuver the flier was killed and 
dozens of spectators were injured fleeing the fiery wreckage 
the crash sunday was the 15th this year for the indian air 
force which has the worlds highest accident rate defense 
statistics show 
the mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed at indian air force day 
celebrations the pilot ramesh bakshi the 39yearold commander 
of the mirage squadron was killed instantly 
dozens of panicked spectators suffered sprained ankles bruises 
or broken bones while running toward or away from the giant 
fireball 
four people were hospitalized in serious condition with burns 
over 50 percent of their bodies military officials said 
the silver deltawinged aircraft was completing a stunt known as 
a vertical charlie the finale of a 20minute display of the 
air forces supersonic fighters transport and training aircraft 
air marshal nc suri vice chief of the air staff said bakshi 
was only scheduled to perform three rolls but instead attempted a 
fourth 
unable to complete the roll and pull out of its rapid descent 
the plane hurtled to the ground as 2000 military and civilian 
dignitaries and other guests attending the 57th anniversary watched 
in horror only 300 yards away 
the plane slammed into the ground and exploded igniting a huge 
fireball as the wreckage bounced through fuel tanks on the ground 
chunks of burning debris hit several vehicles in the parking lot of 
the military section of palam airport in western new delhi 
suri said the pilot may have miscalculated his height because 
the sky was hazy when bakshi started to pull up the plane was 
about 18 feet from the ground they said 
in 198788 alone officials reported 46 crashes of indian air 
force jets most involving the sovietmade mig21 or mig27 
defense officials said that averages 24 crashes per 10000 flying 
hours 
neighboring pakistan had a 12 average britain 08 and the 
united states 065 in the same period the statistics showed

americans j michael bishop and harold 
e varmus won the nobel prize in medicine today for their discovery 
of a family of genes that has helped scientists understand how 
cancer develops 
bishop 53 and varmus 49 work in the department of 
microbiology and immunology at the university of california school 
of medicine in san francisco 
i was stunned said bishop who lives in belvedere outside 
san francisco 
varmus said he was sleeping when he heard the news on the radio 
i didnt know if it was a false alarm or they got my name 
confused not having talked to anyone directly he said from his 
home in san francisco as we say in science i needed 
confirmation of the information 
the 50member nobel assembly of the karolinska institute 
swedens largest and oldest medical university cited the 
researchers for their discovery of the cellular origin of 
retroviral oncogenes 
their 1976 work on oncogenes which control the division and 
growth of cells helped understand how malignant tumors develop 
the citation said 
the discovery also widened our insight into the complicated 
signal systems which govern the normal growth of cells the 
assembly said 
oncogenic virus was discovered as early as 1916 although it was 
not known as such until nearly 50 years later 
bishop and varmus published the remarkable conclusion that the 
oncogene in the virus did not represent a true viral gene but 
instead was a normal cellular gene which the virus had acquired 
during replication in the host cell and thereafter carried along 
the citation said 
peter reichard chairman of the nobel assembly said they have 
clarified how cancer genes work 
the great importance of the discovery is that we have a 
completely different view on how cancer can originate and through 
that we hope to be able to use this practically later on he said 
varmus called the scientists work a cornerstone in 
understanding the genetic mosaic of cancer 
the basic idea that we helped establish is that cancer has its 
origins in genes that normally do us some good but after they 
become abnormal through mutation they cause a role in cancer 
he and bishop will share a 469000 cash prize 
it was the third time the nobel prize has been awarded for 
research in connection with this field of research peyton rous was 
first given the prize after his 1916 discovery of a tumorinducing 
virus which was then called the rous virus 
in 1975 david baltimore renato dulbecco and howard temin were 
awarded the prize for discovering the interaction between tumor 
viruses and the genetic material of the cells 
bishop and vermus were added to a long list of americans who 
have dominated the medicine prize over the last 20 years they were 
the 30th and 31st us winners since 1969 compared with 19 
laureates from all other countries combined 
bishop was born in york pa on feb 22 1936 studied at 
gettysburg college and harvard and worked in the national 
institutes of health outside washington he spent time in hamburg 
west germany before moving to the university of california in 1968 
varmus came from oceanside ny where he was born dec 18 
1939 he studied at amherst college in massachusetts and earned 
his masters degree at harvard in 1962 the same year bishop earned 
his medical degree at harvard varmus received a doctorate from 
columbia university in 1966 
varmus also worked at the national institutes of health as a 
clinical associate before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at the 
california school of medicine in 1970 
the assembly of the karolinska institute never announces a list 
of candidates for the prize but officials say about 250 scientists 
are considered each year many are nominated repeatedly 
the medicine prize was the first of four nobel awards being 
announced this week all are worth 3 million swedish kronor or 
about 469000 the royal swedish academy of sciences will disclose 
the economics prize winner wednesday and the laureates for 
chemistry and physics thursday 
the date for the literature prize has not been announced 
the nobel peace prize was given thursday to the dalai lama the 
exiled spiritual and political leader of tibet for his nonviolent 
struggle against chinas rule of his himalayan country 
last years medicine prize went to sir james w black of great 
britain and to americans gertrude b elion and george h hitchings 
they were cited for developing principles leading to new drugs 
that have been applied against leukemia aids heart disease and 
other lethal illnesses 
the prizes were first awarded in 1901 from the estate of alfred 
nobel the inventor of dynamite

the following is the text of the 
citation from the nobel assembly announcing the winners of the 1989 
nobel prize in medicine 
the nobel assembly at the karolinska institute has today decided 
to award the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for 1989 jointly 
to j michael bishop and harold e varmus for their discovery of 
the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes 
the discovery awarded with this years nobel prize in physiology 
or medicine concerns the normal growth and division of cells 
disturbances in one or some of these socalled oncogenes can lead 
to transformation of a normal cell into a tumor cell and result in 
cancer 
michael bishop and harold varmus used an oncogenic retrovirus to 
identify the growthcontrolling oncogenes in normal cells in 1976 
they published the remarkable conclusion that the oncogene in the 
virus did not represent a true viral gene but instead was a normal 
cellular gene which the virus had acquired during replication in 
the host cell and thereafter carried along 
bishops and varmus discovery of the cellular origin of 
retroviral oncogenes has had an extensive influence on the 
development of our knowledge about mechanisms for tumor 
developement until now more than 40 different oncogenes have been 
demonstrated the discovery has also widened our insight into the 
complicated signal systems which govern the normal growth of cells

pope john paul ii began a visit to the 
worlds largest moslem country today and said indonesias tiny 
roman catholic minority seeks unity with all indonesians 
the popes remarks came amid controversy over a scheduled stop 
in east timor a predominantly catholic portuguese territory 
annexed by indonesia in 1976 
the pope arrived after a weekend visit to seoul south korea 
the pontiff knelt and kissed the tarmac wet from a tropical 
rainstorm in the sticky 90 degree heat 
soldiers lined the 10mile motorcade route from the military 
airport to the palm treeringed presidential palace where 
indonesias prowestern president suharto greeted the pontiff 
there have been several reported threats on the life of the pope 
from moslem extremist groups 
in a country made up of 13766 islands and about 200 ethnic and 
religious groups indonesian governments have stressed the need to 
maintain unity 
john paul immediately sought to make clear that his visit posed 
no threat to unity in this nation of 5 million catholics and 157 
million moslems 
during a mass at a sports stadium the pope said he came as a 
friend of every indonesian in our common humanity and our common 
concern for the development and peace of the world in which we 
live 
he expressed his cordial esteem to our moslem brothers and 
sisters who are so numerous in this country 
i extend the hand of sincere and heartfelt friendship in our 
common belief in the one god our creator and merciful lord the 
pope said speaking in english 
john paul said catholic indonesians were deeply proud of their 
country 
we must be fully catholic and fully indonesian the pope 
said these words are deeply inscribed in the modern history of 
the nation 
the stop in east timor scheduled for thursday has drawn 
protests from portugal but john paul has said the visit does not 
imply vatican recognition of indonesias annexation of the 
territory 
he said last week that skipping the territory would be an 
offense to east timors catholics nearly 80 percent of the 
islands 690000 people 
the 69yearold pontiff is to spend five days in indonesia and 
visit four cities in addition to the capital 
during his twoday visit to south korea he encouraged people to 
work toward unifying the korean peninsula 
korea was the first stop on the popes 10day asian tour he 
also is to visit the indian ocean island nation of mauritius before 
returning to rome on oct 16

police said today that two red cross 
officials kidnapped last week are being held by radical palestinian 
guerrillas led by terrorist mastermind abu nidal 
nidals group has denied taking part in the kidnappings 
we have established that abu nidals men carried out the 
abduction we believe the hostages are held in a base east of 
sidon said a police spokesman who cannot be identified under 
standing regulations 
he said the base was between the villages of majdalyoun and 
bkosta three miles east of sidon the provincial capital of 
south lebanon 
the area is controlled exclusively by abu nidals group the 
spokesman said 
masked gunmen grabbed the two swiss men emmanuel christen 32 
and elio erriquez 23 in sidon on friday bundled them into the 
trunk of a car and drove off toward the ein elhilweh palestinian 
refugee camp on sidons southeastern outskirts 
the police spokesman said the kidnappers drove through ein 
elhilweh to their base east of sidon ein elhilweh is controlled 
by yasser arafats palestine liberation organization which is at 
odds with abu nidals breakaway faction 
asked whether police would attempt to rescue the hostages the 
spokesman said we dont have the necessary force to do that we 
have investigators but not a strike force 
government and police authority power been severely eroded by 14 
years of civil war between christians and moslems leaving power 
largely in the hands of militias 
asked about abu nidals reported involvement in the abductions 
roland sidler chief delegate of the international committee of the 
red cross in south lebanon said we have no new information 
about our missing colleagues 
abu nidals fatahrevolutionary council issued a statement in 
beirut saturday condemning the abductions and offering to help free 
the men but police and the plo have said they do not take the 
denial seriously 
abu nidal is the nom de guerre of sabri albanna who broke away 
from arafats mainstream fatah faction in 1973 his faction has 
been blamed for a score of terrorist attacks including the 
december 1985 attacks on the rome and vienna airports 
fridays kidnapping prompted the red cross to close its 
orthopedic center in sidon which provided artificial limbs for 
civil war and car bomb victims 
about 50 amputees in wheelchairs and on crutches all of them 
patients at the center demonstrated outside the building sunday 
condemning the abductions and demanding the release of christen and 
erriquez 
we had to close it because our two abducted comrades were the 
backbone of the clinics operations sidler said 
plo spokesmen last week accused abu nidals group of the 
kidnappings linking them to a shiite moslem militant mohammed 
hariri who is serving a life sentence in switzerland for hijacking 
an air afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a french passenger 
hariri 22 is reputed to be a member of the iranianbacked 
fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god which is believed to be 
the umbrella for factions holding most of the 18 hostages in 
lebanon 
eight of the hostages are americans the hostage held longest is 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press 
abu nidals group which is bankrolled by libya has a record of 
cooperation with hezbollah 
after us warplanes bombed libyas capital april 15 1986 the 
bodies of three western hostages were found two days later near a 
highway in the central lebanese mountains east of beirut 
beirut newspapers said at the time that the three victims who 
had been held by proiranian militants loyal to hezbollah were 
turned over to abu nidals group to mete out vengeance for the us 
raid

china for the first time has refused to accept 
70 chinese illegal immigrants being returned from hong kong a 
government spokesman said monday 
the immigrants were scheduled to be repatriated to the 
neighboring chinese province of guandong on sunday but chinese 
officials refused to accept them at the border checkpoint 
according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said hong kong has begun talks with chinese officials on the 
issue 
hong kong has been sending back all illegal immigrants from 
china since 1980 previously only those caught at the border were 
repatriated 
more than 12000 illegal immigrants were repatriated to china 
this year the spokesman said 
on wednesday beijing criticized hong kong for permitting 
chinese swimmer yang yang to leave for the united states after he 
was released from a detention center under a discretionary section 
of the immigration code he had been arrested sept 23 for having 
an expired visa 
the swimmer had unsuccessfully sought political asylum in hong 
kong saying he feared chinese authorities would jail him for 
joining in prodemocracy marches in the colony

police are playing down speculation that 
a serial killer is stalking oaklands prostitutes but the slayings 
of six women in a little more than two months have spread fear on 
the streets 
were all a little scared said renee jackson who said she 
had worked oaklands streets for 11 years but not scared enough 
cause were still out here 
police capt jim hahn said it was too early to talk about a 
serial killer pointing out that about 10 prostitutes are killed in 
oakland each year 
still he admits that six deaths in such a short time is 
unusual and the possibility of a single killer isnt being ruled 
out 
six young women with police records for prostitution and drugs 
have been killed although there has been no clear pattern to the 
deaths 
one victim was hanged two were beaten and three were shot 
three were black three white some of the bodies were naked some 
clothed 
the naked body of the latest victim 23yearold sharon f 
frazier was found hanging from a walnut tree in a neighborhood 
park thursday 
police are investigating the sept 20 death of a woman in 
brisbane near san franciscos candlestick park to determine if it 
is connected to the oakland slayings said berry lewis a brisbane 
homicide investigator the victim was a suspected prostitute he 
said 
one prostitute said she had warned two of the victims about a 
man who attacked her on aug 31 one of the women died sept 20 
and the other died five days later about two blocks apart 
the woman who would not give her name said she had been raped 
and robbed by a customer who claimed he hated whores and that all

romanian leader nicolae ceausescu has 
toured poorly stocked markets in bucharest and promised better food 
supplies a news agency reported monday 
agerpres said ceausescu whose unexpected visit of food outlets 
in romanias capital on sunday came just a day after returning from 
celebrations in east germany announced improvements in 
governmentsponsored food programs 
there has been growing criticism of food shortages in romania 
as well as recent unofficial calls for ceausescu to step down 
the programs of good supply to the population should be 
extended and developed the report said without elaborating 
under ceausescus centralized economy romania once the 
breadbasket of eastern europe has faced rationing of staples such 
as meat flour cooking oil and bread while fresh vegetables and 
fruit have been hard to find even in spring and summer 
sugar has been rationed to 22 pounds per person per month and 
cooking oil to one quart per person a month 
last month the government announced that starting oct 1 oil 
and sugar supplies would be augmented by 20 percent and 15 percent 
respectively 
most of romanias farmland is owned by state collective farms 
and only 10 percent is tilled privately in small plots or gardens 
around farmers houses 
the visit and the analysis that followed disclosed the 
steadfast preoccupation of the leadeship with the rhythmic 
supply of markets to the planned extent and at an 
appropriate level of quality agerpres said 
delegates to a romanian communist party congress scheduled for 
next month have been urged recently to denounce ceausescu for 
incompetence and oust him as party leader 
ceausescu 71 was unanimously proposed by the partys 
policysetting central committee in the summer to be reelected at 
the nov 2025 congress 
addressing a party meeting of economic experts last week he 
made clear that under his hardline rule romania would never adopt 
economic and political reforms under way in hungary poland and the 
soviet union 
in an unusually harsh criticism the government daily romania 
libera blamed transportation problems bad organization and 
careless administration for the food shortages 
a large crowd was waiting in line at the vegetables counter of 
titan market although nothing was on sale the newspaper said 
asked about the absence of fresh vegetables market officials 
said only 19 metric tons of potatoes were delivered out of the 
planned 25 tons while deliveries of carrots eggplants and greens 
remained only on paper 
only once we received pears from stateowned farms this 
summer the officials told romania libera 
after you tour 1015 markets you can conclude that 
distribution is wrongly done it said

the failed panamanian coup last week is 
forcing us policymakers to reexamine the restraint that has kept 
the united states from intervening more forcefully in smaller 
nations 
for 15 years concern about becoming bogged down in another 
vietnam has influenced us leaders decisions about intervention 
and president bushs decision not to openly assist the attempted 
coup against panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega showed he was 
not prepared to risk us lives and prestige in a military 
operation that had neither clear public support nor a clear chance 
of success 
still bushs predecessor president reagan armed 
anticommunist guerrillas in nicaragua and other nations where 
leftist governments had come to power following the us withdrawal 
from southeast asia 
while members of congress have welcomed diminished bush 
administration support for nicaraguan guerrillas the confused us 
response in panama brought calls from capitol hill from both 
democrats and republicans for bush to be bolder 
failure is the father of about 100 hawks on capitol hill now 
suddenly everyone is fluttering around the senate and the house 
saying lets use military force said sen william cohen 
rmaine a bush supporter 
i find it ironic that many of the same people who have imposed 
some restrictions on the administration by deed or word suddenly 
now want to use american force cohen said on the abctv program 
this week with david brinkley 
i think it is an opportunity for all of us to finally lay it 
out do the american people by virtue of the congress really 
support the use of force to take out noriega either overtly or 
covertly weve got to know that said cohen the vice chairman 
of the senate intelligence committee 
another republican sen alfonse damato rny however 
called the administrations handling of the coup an incredible 
stain on us and said white house statements were a weakkneed 
explanation for failure 
and democratic sen david boren of oklahoma chairman of the 
intelligence committee said i dont think its right for this 
country for a great country to go out and encourage people to 
take action put their lives on the line to imply by encouraging 
them to take that action that were going to help them and not be 
there 
a poll released by newsweek magazine over the weekend showed 
support for bushs approach while 60 percent of those polled 
thought it very important to the united states that general 
noriega give up power in panama 45 percent said us involvement 
was just about right thirty percent said america played not 
enough of a role in the coup attempt and 9 percent said too 
much 
the poll of 750 people conducted last thursday and friday had 
a 4 percent margin of error 
the issue is broader than whether the united states should use 
force against noriega say administration officials as well as 
lawmakers who criticized bush 
should the united states intervene militarily in other nations 
after the kremlin withdrew its army from afghanistan and signaled 
that it would not block democratic moves under way in such soviet 
bloc countries as poland or hungary 
or as formulated by one of bushs most outspoken critics sen 
sam nunn dga what would us allies think if the administration 
had used troops from american military bases in panama to topple 
noriega 
international considerations come into play here we cant 
have tunnel vision on panama said nunn the chairman of the 
senate armed services committee 
we cannot ignore the repercussions of using a us base for 
aiding or launching a coup said nunn referring to lease renewal 
negotiations for two key american military installations in the 
philippines 
what we do in countries where we have bases has a direct 
bearing on such negotiations nunn said last week 
the disclosure on sunday that bush aides had been laying plans 
for covert action to grab noriega during the coup clouded the us 
position 
the administration said defense secretary dick cheney has 
not ruled out the use of military force against noriega 
but us involvement in a coup against noriega would set off 
alarm bells all over latin america including among american allies 
in the war on drugs cheney said on the cbstv program face the 
nation 
if you are actively involved and using us military force to 
topple governments of latin america youre going to have a lot of 
trouble getting the colombians and peruvians and bolivians and 
others to agree to have military training teams for example 
said cheney 
the way that you use the military effectively in latin america 
is to help the latin americans help themselves not use us 
military forces to topple latin american governments

despite a string of record profits hundreds 
of commercial banks and the government insurance fund that 
guarantees their deposits are far less healthy than they seem 
analysts say 
the warnings are making members of congress nervous just two 
months after they enacted a 50 billion threeyear bailout of the 
savings and loan industry 
legislators remember all too well the reassurances they heard 
from regulators and industry executives while the sampl business was 
crumbling and how quickly hints of trouble mushroomed into the 
most dire financial crisis since the depression 
two wellknown banking economists robert e litan of the 
brookings institution a liberal think tank and r dan brumbaugh 
jr of stanford university report that commercial banks though 
better off as a whole than sampls may be heading for trouble 
themselves 
litan appearing before the senate banking committee last week 
warned that about twothirds of the reserves in the federal deposit 
insurance corps bank fund will be needed for banks that are weak 
or already insolvent 
at the end of june the fdics bank reserves totaled 145 
billion but litan and brumbaugh say their analysis of bank data 
through march shows that 95 billion of that is needed to cover 
losses at banks that are insolvent or close to it leaving only a 
thin 5 billion layer of protection before taxpayers would be 
called on to bail out the fund 
a postdepression record of 221 banks failed last year so far 
this year 167 have closed or required government assistance to 
stay open 116 in texas 
fdic chairman l william seidman says he expects failures for 
all of 1989 to be slightly below last year and to decline further 
in 1990 
however a study by analyst william c ferguson of irving 
texas casts doubt o that he said that 443 banks of 13000 
nationwide have been losing money consistently from 1987 through 
the first quarter of this year 
in spite of the high reported earnings of the banking industry 
overall the picture is not as rosy as it seems ferguson said 
if present earnings trends for these 443 banks continue this 
group will run out of capital by late 1990 or early 1991 
the banking industry disputes its critics 
skeptics make a living peddling a different tune nebraska 
banker cg holthus presidentelect of the american bankers 
association told a house subcommittee we think theyre 
exaggerating the problem 
by many measures commercial banks unlike savings and loans 
are flourishing 
banks earned a record sixmonth profit of 143 billion in the 
first half of 1989 on top of the record annual profit of 251 
billion last year and their three most pressing problems have all 
eased 
the nations largest banks have added to their loss reserves 
putting them in a better position to withstand a deterioration of 
shaky third world debtor nations to repay the banks loans 
the string of midwestern bank failures has subsided with the 
recovery of the farm economy 
the economies of texas and other oilproducing states where 
most of the failures are concentrated now appear to have bottomed 
out 
moreover the savings and loan bailout bill passed this summer 
nearly doubles the insurance premium paid by banks that will 
provide an added 15 billion a year to help the fund recover from 
its firstever loss in 1988 
simply put the condition of commercial banks is not a thrift 
crisis in sheeps clothing said james j mcdermott jr of keefe 
bruyette amp woods inc an analyst who expresses more optimism than 
some of his colleagues 
replied sen john heinz rpa im not sure im reassured 
its a little bit like saying the united states is better off 
than bangladesh 
on the house side rep frank annunzio dill has been voicing 
similar worries and last week asked congress auditing arm the 
general accounting office to conduct a comprehensive study of the 
deposit insurance fund and the condition of banking 
although federal regulators paint a rosy picture of the 
industry certain industry experts cast doubt on this assessment i 
am deeply troubled over the concerns raised by these experts he 
said in a letter requesting the study 
the analysts identify two areas as the likely causes of the next 
banking crisis large banks growing involvement in financing 
leveraged corporate buyouts and community banks decision to follow 
thrifts into real estate lending 
bank real estate loans have soared 75 percent from 364 billion 
in 1984 to 636 billion in 1988 according to consultant alex 
sheshunoff of austin texas softening property values in 
northeastern states are particularly ominous 
real estate lending has become the achilles heel of banking 
he said some of the growth unfortunately financed 
speculative excesses which will take time to absorb

president corazon aquino said monday 
she would not compromise her refusal to let ferdinand e marcos 
her exiled predecessor be buried in the philippines 
a manila newspaper quoted imelda marcos the former presidents 
widow as suggesting terms be negotiated for allowing marcos to be 
buried in ilocos norte his home province marcos died sept 28 in 
honolulu at age 72 
two senators urged defense secretary fidel ramos to reveal 
details of an alleged plot to kill mrs aquino in connection with a 
coup by marcos forces 
marcos had lived in exile in hawaii since a civilianmilitary 
uprising drove him from the country on feb 26 1986 after 20 
years in office mrs aquino cited fears of civil unrest in 
refusing to allow the return of the body or marcos relatives 
in a statement monday she said the position against the 
return of the remains of former president marcos is based on 
considerations of national interest and security so it cannot be 
the subject of compromise 
cabinet officials said last week the ban was based in part on 
intelligence reports of a plot to assassinate mrs aquino the 
government has not released details but congressmen briefed on the 
contents have warned of a serious threat to stability if marcos 
body is returned 
sen ernesto maceda chairman of the senate defense committee 
said ramos should reveal the reports public because of their 
seriousness 
sen juan ponce enrile the former defense minister and an 
opposition senator endorsed macedas request to which the 
government did not respond 
malaya a manila newspaper quoted mrs marcos as suggesting 
discussions about the burial could begin when mrs aquino visits 
the united states in november 
i have always been open to this she was quoted as saying 
we have initiated it and we will not tire to initiate such a move 
because of our obsession with what is right 
the supreme court has asked the government to respond by friday 
to a petition by marcos supporters asking that the ban on the 
bodys return be nullified 
an 87 court ruling last month found marcos to be a security 
threat but loyalists hope the justices will reconsider now that 
the former president is dead 
mrs aquino told a business group monday forgiving the marcoses 
would undermine public faith in morality 
the spirit of reconciliation has been extended to the blind 
forgiveness of those who fronted for the dicatorship and who have 
yet to make restitution to the nation she declared 
my critical attitude toward this development has been called 
vindictiveness what worries me about this is not so much that 
the guilty are escaping censure but that the millions of innocent 
filipinos will lose faith in the value of morals 
several manila newspapers reported from honolulu that sen 
joseph estrada was trying to mediate between the marcos family and 
the government 
estrada who left for hawaii on friday was elected to the 
senate in may 1987 as an opposition member but later joined the 
governing coalition he is a former actor and served as mayor of 
san juan a manila suburb during the marcos presidency

a white mans claim that a lack of black jurors 
denied him a fair trial on charges including rape is among the 
cases the us supreme court is to consider this week 
in arguments scheduled wednesday before the court daniel 
hollands lawyers plan to argue that white defendants should be 
accorded the same constitutional right granted to blacks to 
challenge racial bias during jury selection 
prosecutors say race was not an issue and contend that hollands 
case could lead to unworkable quotas for juries 
an allwhite jury in the suburban des plaines branch of cook 
county circuit court convicted holland in 1981 on charges of rape 
sexual assault kidnapping and armed robbery in the abduction of a 
17yearold girl and her boyfriend 
the victims were driving home from a party when their car had a 
flat tire holland offered them a ride then pulled a knife 
threatened the girl and ordered the boyfriend out of the car 
according to court documents 
holland then drove to a des plaines apartment complex raped the 
girl several times and took about 60 before fleeing the documents 
show 
he was arrested later that morning and tried by a jury selected 
from a pool of about 40 people two of whom were black 
hollands conviction was overturned on other grounds by the 
illinois appellate court but reinstated later by the state supreme 
court 
his appeal puts the spotlight on a legal tradition that allows 
lawyers to reject a certain number of potential jurors without 
giving a reason using what are called peremptory challenges 
in hollands case prosecutors dimissed the two blacks and eight 
other people without a reason but said race was not an issue 
prosecutors are barred from using peremptory challenges to 
exclude blacks from juries for racial reasons under a 1986 supreme 
court decision but the high court has held that only minorities 
have a right to challenge racial bias during jury selection 
white defendants have no comparable weapon to fight racial 
bigotry donald honchell an attorney for holland wrote in 
arguments filed with the us supreme court there can be no 
image of a fair jury in the eyes of the community if the process of 
selecting it sanctions discrimination 
inge fryklund supervisor of criminal appeals for the states 
attorneys office contends that hollands lawyers are trying to 
twist the constitutional right to an impartial jury into a mandate 
that all juries be representative of communities from which they 
are selected 
that would be unsound unworkable and unnecessary ms 
fryklund argues

the government is switching to a new 
longdistance telephone network designed to provide 13 million 
federal workers with stateoftheart voice data and video 
communications 
the move which officials say will save taxpayers hundreds of 
millions of dollars comes after five years of study wrangling and 
complaints by losing bidders 
the changeover began during the long columbus day weekend at 31 
government buildings nationwide ultimately more than 1300 
locations in 90 federal agencies will be tied to the network when 
it is fully installed in mid1990 
the general services administration is overseeing the mammoth 
switchover with the two prime contractors that won a fierce bidding 
war for the project american telephone amp telegraph co and us 
sprint communications co 
known as fts2000 for the federal telecommunications system 
2000 the contract may be worth as much as 25 billion over 10 
years to atampt and sprint 
gsa estimates fts2000 will save taxpayers between 15 million 
and 20 million a month for regular telephone service or as much 
as half of the governments 400 million annual phone bill 
the governments phone bill is going to be going down 
substantially beginning this weekend michael corrigan gsa 
deputy commissioner for telecommunications services said in a 
recent interview 
atampt says a fiveminute call between washington and san 
francisco will cost about 70 cents under fts2000 compared with 
140 on atampts regular longdistance service or 135 on the 
governments existing network 
fts2000 replaces a phone system that atampt installed in 1963 the 
old network provided only voice commmunications and lowspeed data 
transmission 
when fts2000 is fully in place federal employees will be able 
to communicate with new speed and efficiency over crystalclear 
digital fiberoptic phone lines that transmit information on beams 
of laser light 
atampt and sprint are banking on federal agencies buying 
additional services such as videoconferencing highspeed facsimile 
service or systems to link large numbers of computers 
fts2000 is a 10year fixedrate contract that gives the 
government special low rates to use sprints existing public 
network and new atampt lines essentially dedicated to fts2000 
corrigan said 
under the contract which congress began considering in 1984 and 
gsa awarded in december atampt will serve 60 percent of federal 
government and sprint 40 percent the two companies will rebid for 
40 percent of the others share of the contract during the fourth 
and seventh years of the agreement 
mci communications corp the nations no 2 longdistance 
company behind atampt lost the bidding and has battled in court and 
at the federal communications commission to overturn the contract 
mci claimed that atampts fts2000 prices discriminated against 
atampts regular customers and that the prices were below atampts 
costs 
the fcc rejected mcis claims 
the new system will make it easier for the government to protect 
secrets by using fiberoptic cable which are buried in the ground 
because they dont use electromagnetic signals they cant be 
tapped by normal means

the museum of modern art agreed to sell two 
picassos a monet a renoir and three other paintings from its 
permanent collection to get vincent van goghs portrait of the 
postman joseph roulin the new york times reported monday 
the portrait painted in 188889 arrived at the museum from a 
bank vault in zurich on july 31 now details of the deal that 
brought it here have been made public 
for much of this century the painting was in the b mayer 
collection in zurich it was bought in 1987 by the most recent 
owners and placed in the bank vault 
christopher burge president of christies in new york 
estimated recently that roulin would be worth roughly the same 
at auction as van goghs irises which brought 539 million in 
1987 
kirk varnedoe director of painting and sculpture at the modern 
told the times the museum got roulin for substantially less 
than that because the unidentified owners wanted it to hang in a 
museum still he said the price was not a raging firesale 
bargain 
at first varnedoe said museum officials didnt think they 
could afford the van gogh but because of changes in the art 
market pictures we had available were worth more than we had 
thought they were worth and so it now seemed possible 
in august the museum in exchange for roulin gave four 
paintings and an undisclosed amount of cash to swiss dealers thomas 
ammann and ernst beyeler who represented the owners 
the dealers received a monet titled corona water lilies 
from around 1920 renoirs reclining nude 1902 wassily 
kandinskys autumn landscape murnau 1908 and picassos 
striped bodice september 1943 
to reimburse the modern for the cash it paid and varnedoe 
hopes provide some extra profits as well three other paintings 
will be sold at auction on nov 15 at sothebys in new york 
they are giorgio de chiricos evangelical still life 1916 
which has a presale estimate of 2 million to 3 million piet 
mondrians blue facade composition 9 191314 estimated at 
3 million to 4 million and picassos studio in a painted 
frame april 1956 estimated at 2 million to 3 million 
the donors of the works granted permission to sell them 
varnedoe said the paintings that were relinquished had mostly 
languished in storage for years and were not considered crucial 
representations of the collection even so he said the van gogh 
merited a considerable sacrifice 
we feel van goghs portraits are the starting point for a 
whole vein of 20thcentury art said varnedoe they had 
influence on matisse and many others the whole concept of 
revealing a personality not by appearance but color had a profound 
influence and we were not telling this part of the story of modern 
art without the portrait it was a missing chapter

the nations top educator has announced 
the beginning of a nationwide study of american indian schooling 
that he hopes will help change decades of disappointing academic 
performance 
you may say weve been studying this problem for 200 years 
why another study secretary of education lauro cavazos said 
sunday but you have to start thinking about what we dont know 
just by calling attention to it hopefully we can bring america to 
focus on this problem 
with luck maybe by the turn of the century well start 
turning the corner 
cavazos spoke at the kickoff meeting of the national indian 
education associations 21st annual conference scheduled through 
thursday about 1400 american indian educators from across the 
nation are attending 
cavazos said the study is vital because the nation has no 
comprehensive statistics on american indian school achievement but 
what is known is enough to suggest that a need for extra attention 
he said 
he noted a 90 percent unemployment rate on some indian 
reservations and a school dropout rate double the national average 
of 25 percent he said 75 percent of the american indian students 
who make it to college fail to finish 
cavazos titled the study indian nations at risk borrowing 
from the 1983 a nation at risk report on the countrys ailing 
public education system

nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said monday 
the western allies must use aid to support political change in 
poland and hungary which he called test cases of the alliances 
strategy 
the windows have been opened in the closed societies of 
eastern europe the allies do not intend to let them slam shut 
again woerner said in a speech to the north atlantic assembly a 
consultative organization of legislators from nato countries 
he said the flight of 50000 east germans to the west the 
decision to give hungarys communist party a new name and platform 
strikes by soviet miners and the joy of the poles as they greet 
their first noncommunist prime minister in 40 years demonstrate 
that the peoples of the east have not become accustomed to their 
political leadership 
even if the alliance does not have responsibility for specific 
aid programs only nato can harmonize and coordinate the efforts of 
the member nations as a whole on these herculean tasks only nato 
brings the combined resources of north american and western europe 
to bear on them woerner said 
he said the aid efforts should concentrate on poland and hungary 
because they are taking steps to move closer to democracy and give 
reform a chance 
poland and hungary are the two test cases said woerner 
if reform fails the lessons will not be lost on the hardliners 
in czechoslovakia and east germany but if reform succeeds that 
success will generate irresistible presures for similar change 
throughout eastern europe 
he said nato should use its limited influence to support change 
by backing soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and others in 
their reforms promoting more openness pluralism human rights and 
human contact 
the postwar period has come to an end we are seeing the 
profound transformation of the european political and security 
structure this offers us opportunites which we should and will not 
miss said woerner 
but he cautioned the western allies against making unilateral 
moves that he said weaken the alliance 
i will not hide my concern at a tendency that i observe today 
in most of our member nations which are starting to unilaterally 
reduce their defense efforts said woerner it is wrong and 
its dangerous 
the soviet response to allied proposals at the conventional arms 
talks in vienna has been encouraging he said but the warsaw pact 
retains an overwhelming superiority in conventional arms 
nato must base its security on soviet and warsaw pact potential 
not on announced intentions said woerner

police acknowledged monday that farmers have been 
found growing opium poppies in the southwestern border areas and 
that drug addiction has become a problem in the region 
liu wen director of criminal investigation in the ministry of 
public security said he did not know the number of addicts and 
all poppy crops found have been eradicated 
both problems were byproducts of a growing transit trade in 
drugs from southeast asia through southern china to hong kong and 
macao he said 
liu spoke at a news conference at the end of a fiveday 
conference on drug law enforcement in asia organized by interpol 
the meeting closed to reporters was an important conference of 
practical significance liu said 
he said the 79 delegates from 32 countries and regions adopted a 
10point resolution calling on their governments to make antidrug 
efforts a top priority and strengthen international cooperation 
including financial assistance for underdeveloped countries 
fighting drug trafficking 
they also called on interpol to study the possiblity of setting 
up a drug law enforcement training center in asia 
interpol officials said chinas drug problem remains relatively 
small but yuan yongyuan deputy director of criminal 
investigation said the number of drug trafficking cases discovered 
in 1988 reached 268 up from just 56 the year before he said 
police seized 525 pounds of opium in 1988 nearly double the 1987 
amount and 365 pounds of heroin nearly four times the 1987 amount 
partial figures for 1989 showed continued increase he said 
after eliminating drugs for 30 years many people in china 
are not prepared and are not paying enough attention including 
police and customs officials he said they cannot recognize 
heroin and opium 
opium addiction was one of chinas most serious social problems 
in the early part of the century after taking power in 1949 the 
communists executed drug traffickers and reeducated users for 
decades the government said drug abuse had been wiped out 
yuan blamed its reemergence on chinas increased foreign 
contacts since 1978 and especially the relaxed policy on allowing 
hong kong residents to enter the mainland 
hong kong residents have been convicted in several drug 
smuggling cases in recent years one was executed in february after 
being convicted of recruiting three mainland chinese in a smuggling 
scheme opium and heroin are brought into southern chinas yunnan 
province from burma thailand and laos and on to canton and hong 
kong for sale to the west 
most of the conference participants were from asia and the 
middle east the only western countries to attend were colombia and

president roh taewoo who meets with 
president bush next week said monday he hopes for stronger ties 
with the united states and he scolded dissidents for their 
antiamerican attitude 
roh said antiamerican acts such as flagburnings and violent 
protests have contributed to antikorean sentiments in the united 
states and he urged the small number of extreme radicals to 
change their attitude 
i have reports that american feelings inside and outside the 
government towards our country are worsening as some south korean 
forces have shown fierce antiamerican sentiments and also 
committed violent acts he said in a weekly nationwide radio 
address 
radical students and dissidents a small but vocal minority 
have staged demonstrations demanding the withdrawal of 43000 us 
troops stationed in south korea radicals allege roh is a puppet of 
washington and have called for his ouster 
some us congressmen have proposed cutting us troops strength 
in south korea saying seoul can afford its own defense bush and 
roh have said the troops would remain as long as both sides feel 
they are needed 
roh is scheduled to visit washington oct 1618 to talk with 
bush and address a joint session of congress on topics ranging from 
bilaterial security issues to us demand for a larger access to 
the korean market 
roh said he planned to discuss the direction in which our 
country and the united states can advance as cooperative partners 
toward common ideals 
roh said trade frictions between the two countries and 
controversy over the us miltiary presence reflect south koreas 
growing economy and new sense of nationalism 
south koreas trade surplus with the united states which buys 
about 35 percent of koreas exports stood at 86 billion last 
year 
he said friction over us demands for korea to open its markets 
and to appreciate its won currency against the dollar have fueled 
the antiamerican sentiment 
roh said the united states like any other county is seeking 
its national interest he said huge us trade deficits are a 
factor threatening the stability of the world economy and south 
koreas economy heavily dependent on exports could suffer if the 
world economy falls into trouble 
he said however that this does not mean south korea should 
comply with all us requests in opening its markets washington 
has threatened to retaliate if seoul refuses to increase beef 
imports and complained that korea failed to protect american 
intellectual property rights 
he said the us military presence helps maintain peace and 
stability in east asia and deters an invasion from communist north 
korea

members of hungarys revamped ruling 
party today adopted a manifesto pledging to bring democracy to the 
nation and then chose the head of the defunct communist party as 
their leader 
delegates told reporters they chose rezsoe nyers as president of 
the hungarian socialist party after key reformists reluctantly 
shelved their reservations to avoid a possible split within the 
party 
nyers who is considered a moderate will lead the party during 
the campaign for the first free national elections in 41 years 
the selection was expected to exacerbate anxieties among some 
reformists who want a clean break from the past and who worry that 
the new party will not differ substantially from its predecessor 
tension was reported following a decision by delegates sunday to 
continue allowing party politics in the workplace it has been a 
common practice for communists to hold meetings and conduct 
political courses for employees in the workplace 
reformers associate it with the indoctrination practices of 
traditional marxistleninist communist parties 
along with nyers the top candidates to lead the new party were 
premier miklos nemeth and imre pozsgay both reformers unlike 
nyers they supported keeping politics separate from the workplace 
nyers was chairman of the hungarian socialist workers party or 
communist party which was disbanded saturday at the congress and 
replaced by the socialist party founding documents describe the 
new party as one with eurocommunist and socialist leanings 
committed to a free market economy and a parliamentary democracy 
in a vote today earlier taken by a show of hands delegates 
overwhelmingly approved a manifesto calling for a constitutional 
state based on a multiparty system where the source of power is 
the will of the people expressed in free elections 
the socialist party was described as an organization in the 
marxist spirit totally committed to democracy 
 
all members of the old party are automatically members of the 
new one and can continue to remain so by stating their agreement 
with its democratic principles 
the document creating the socialist party said it supports the 
concept of private and state property and the development of a 
multiparty parliamentary democracy 
the move was the latest of a number of bold reforms in hungary 
which with poland is in the forefront of democratic reform in the 
east bloc 
but the initial euphoria of reformers seeking to create a party 
with wide popular appeal was dampened when the congress endorsed 
keeping politics in the workplace 
of about 1200 delegates present for sundays balloting just 107 
including pozsgay nemeth and foreign minister gyula horn voted 
against the measure there were 34 abstentions 
free national elections are to be held by june and the 
socialist party will remain in power at least until then 
but the new tensions could create a conflict between the party 
and the government which nemeth leads 
a source speaking on condition of anonymity said nyers and 
nemeth arent talking to each other 
even before the workplace vote deputy premier peter medgyessy 
had urged the new party to stop interfering in government business 
pending the national elections 
in other developments sunday 
a ranking communist conservative former politburo member 
janos berecz defied saturdays decision by the congress to create 
a new party he said the old party should should continue to exist 
until the rank and file decides on its fate 
robert ribanszki another opponent of change said he planned to 
organize a plebiscite among the partys 720000 members 
officials at the congress said the hardline communist east 
berlin leadership embittered over hungarys decision to allow 
east germans free passage to the west had expressed its 
congratulations at the partys transformation 
spokesman emil kimmel refused to elaborate telling reporters 
the text of the east german message would be published today along 
with one from romania a soviet bloc country that has previously 
condemned hungarian reforms 
he also did not say whether the soviets had sent congratulations

harold e varmus says his first reaction 
was disbelief when he was awakened by a radio interviewer this 
morning and told he had shared the 1989 nobel prize in medicine 
i didnt know if it was a false alarm or they got my name 
confused not having talked to anyone directly said varmus 49 
as we say in science i needed confirmation of the information 
he and j michael bishop 53 a colleague at the university of 
california school of medicine in san francisco won the nobel for 
their discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes 
their 1976 work on oncogenes which control the growth of cells 
helped explain how malignant tumors develop the nobel citation 
said 
bishop said he was stunned by the news and called his 
situation this morning surreal 
later at a news conference at uc san francisco bishop declined 
to speculate about the proximity of a cancer cure 
thats an imponderable at the moment he said 
certainly we have a better image of whats wrong with the cancer 
cell at the moment 
varmus said he didnt think at the time that his work would lead 
to the prize 
i dont go to work thinking about the nobel prize varmus 
said i go to work thinking about the next experiment 
obviously in the last few years when you look back and see 
that it had an impact in the field then it becomes a 
possibility he said but its a possibility surrounded by the 
incredible work of others who would also be deserving of it 
there has been so much work in related fields in recent years 
that i was beginning to think we had gotten lost in the 
blizzard varmus said at the news conference 
he called the original work published in 1976 a cornerstone in 
understanding the genetic mosaic of cancer 
the basic idea that we helped establish is that cancer has its 
origins in genes that normally do us some good he said but 
after they become abnormal through mutation they cause a role in 
cancer 
we have the seeds of cancer in our own genetic dowry bishop 
said adding that even so it doesnt mean that cancer is always 
inherited 
the award includes a 469000 cash prize to be split by the two 
does varmus have any spending plans i need a new compact disc 
player he responded adding that his wife is lobbying for a 
builtin dishwasher 
both varmus who wore blue jeans to the news conference and 
bishop who was dressed in a suit and tie said immediate plans 
included attending the fifth game of the national league pennant 
race beween the san francisco giants and chicago cubs 
were off to the game just got tickets bishop said 
earlier varmus had showed how much he is a baseball fan by 
quizzing associated press photographer paul sakuma one of the 
journalists gathered at his doorstep when he leared sakuma had 
just come from photographing the oakland as return from toronto 
he interrupted his interviews and asked sakuma hey what do you 
think of jose canseco 
but he also showed his enthusiasm for his research saying he 
hoped the publicity would give the public some feeling for the 
excitement and the beauty of understanding how cells work and the 
hope that we think we hope we generate by beginning to 
understand in very specific terms what goes wrong when a cell 
becomes a cancer cell

the lines are being drawn in congress for 
coming battles over animalprotection bills 
on one side is rep vin weber rminn who says congress needs 
a commonsense voice to combat the efforts of animalrights 
activists 
weber recently started recruiting likeminded collegues to join 
a group he tentatively calls the animal welfare caucus 
i think we have a broad concern that the use of animals for 
legitimate purposes is being unfairly projected to the general 
public and vilified to the general public in a way that ulitimately 
could have an impact on the quality of life of a lot of people 
said weber 
on the other side is annette lantos wife of rep tom lantos 
dcalif she is helping him and rep robert smith rnh organize 
the congressional friends of animals which has already sponsored a 
tour of an army laboratory in san francisco 
weber has enlisted three other house members so far including 
rep charles stenholm dtexas chairman of the house agriculture 
livestock subcommittee 
webers opponents have received responses from 15 colleagues to 
a dear colleague letter announcing the new group and expect to 
sign up 30 to 40 mrs lantos said 
the caucuses plan to serve as forums for debate and 
clearinghousses of information on a mounting number of bills facing 
congress 
among the bills several that would make it illegal to break into 
laboratories and destroy documents 
other bills would set size requirements for vealcalf crates 
prohibit certain lethal testing of laboratory animals and require 
special labels on cans of tuna that were caught in nets that 
endanger dolphins 
still another bill would allow someone to sue the government on 
behalf of an animal to make the agriculture department enforce the 
animal welfare act 
but weber said that consumers and many members of congress dont 
realize the impact the animalrights movement could have on farming 
and medical research 
i dont think the average animal lover wants to stop research 
that may be vital to finding a cure for alzheimers disease he 
said 
weber says he is concerned that the animalrights movement will 
try to write livestock protections into the 1990 farm bill 
but the growing number of animalprotection bills reflects the 
rising public concern about animal rights said betsy dribben 
director of government relations for the humane society of the 
united states 
congressional offices routinely have a worker assigned to animal 
issues where a few years ago they had none she said 
theres a growing wealth of legislation addressing animal 
protection issues because the public is concerned she said 
members of congress are hearing from their constituents

needlessly of cervical cancer in a new tv movie says the role 
changed her attitude toward health care 
it made me more positive about participating in it she said 
in the november redbook no offense to doctors but ive never 
liked them they give bad news before i made this movie if i felt 
pain id just sit and suffer 
the la law star says she once ignored a tumor in her 
breast for a year until the pain got so bad that i couldnt lift 
my arm the problem turned out to be a benign cyst that was 
removed 
but she says she changed her mind after portraying the reallife 
story of a woman who didnt learn about her condition until it was 
too late although doctors had warning signs 
the movie i love you perfect should make an impact 
she said it will make women aware that there is a need for the 
medical profession in their lives but that they must participate 
in their own health care and not just allow other people to take 
over

sevenyearold jamie fiske who as an infant 
received a liver transplant after her fathers impassioned appeal 
for a donor underwent surgery today to remove her spleen 
shes in the recovery room now doing very well dr john 
najarian said after the threehour operation at university of 
minnesota hospital the girl was listed in critical but stable 
condition after the operation 
najarian said the spleen was seven or eight times normal size 
for a child jamies age he also said her liver is perfectly 
normal 
hopefully shell do well and be out of here in a weeks 
time he said its hard to predict 
it was the first surgery for jamie since her 1982 liver 
transplant which also took place at university of minnesota 
hospital said jamies father charles fiske of bridgewater mass 
at the time she was one of the youngest liver transplant 
recipients 
jamie was born nov 26 1981 with biliary atresia a condition 
in which the livers bile ducts are blocked months later the 
fiskes learned that only a liver transplant could save her life 
she underwent a liver transplant after her father then a 
hospital administrator made an emotional appeal for a donor during 
a convention at the american academy of pediatricians the 
nationally televised plea including fiske singing please dont 
take my sunshine away resulted in the offer a few days later 
from a family in utah whose 11monthold son was killed in an 
accident 
on saturday fiske said weve been in worse places and 
times 
still he said its major surgery for her given the fact she 
had a liver transplant whats giving us confidence is that were 
coming back to an institution that knows her the doctors have seen 
her grow up 
the minneapolis hospital sent an air ambulance thursday to 
massachusetts to pick up jamie and her father jamie who is listed 
in stable condition has suffered three bouts of internal bleeding 
this fall and her doctors think an enlarged spleen may be 
responsible fiske said 
but jamies mind isnt on her impending surgery fiske said 
shes worried about whether she will be able to dress up as the 
queen of hearts for halloween he said 
she said to me today what about halloween will i be back in 
boston for halloween 
he said doctors have estimated jamie will be in the hospital for 
about 10 days fiske said he hopes to have jamie home in 
bridgewater 35 miles south of boston by halloween 
doctors dont believe jamies current problem is related to the 
liver transplant fiske said in a news conference saturday 
her spleen began to enlarge one year after her transplant but 
doctors said there had been no complications with it until now 
fiske said her current problems began in her first week of second 
grade this fall when she suffered flulike symptoms she was 
hospitalized for tests and doctors found she lost a large amount of 
blood 
when a spleen enlarges blood vessels must find alternate routes 
around the organ bulge and are likely to tear thats what doctors 
believe has happened in this case fiske said

a french researcher who worked for the two 
americans honored monday with the nobel prize for medicine said he 
did the work on their project and should have at least shared the 
award 
i am very disappointed said dr dominique stehelin a 
director of research for the national center for scientific 
research at the pasteur institute in lille i find all that very 
unfair and rotten 
j michael bishop and harold e varmus won the nobel prize in 
medicine for their discovery of a family of genes that has helped 
scientists understand how cancer develops bishop and varmus work 
in the department of microbiology and immunology at the university 
of california school of medicine in san francisco 
the 50member nobel assembly of the karolinska institute in 
sweden cited the researchers for their discovery of the cellular 
origin of retroviral oncogenes 
in 1976 bishop and varmus published the remarkable conclusion 
that the oncogene in the virus did not represent a true viral gene 
but instead was a normal cellular gene the citation said 
cancer viruses cause cancer with the help of animal genes that 
have become incorporated into the viruses the animal genes 
normally help control the regular growth of cells but when the 
genes become part of viruses they can trigger the uncontrolled 
cell growth that typifies cancer tumors 
i did the work all by myself from a to z stehelin told the 
french news agency agence francepresse i spent three years in 
their san francisco lab from 1972 to 1975 at a time when nobody 
other than me was working on the subject and i am not even 
associated in this distinction the nobel 
stehelin said he was the first and principal signer of the first 
article in the scientific magazine nature in 1976 on the discovery 
of a cellular gene which is at the origin of the emergence of a 
cancer 
a year after my depart from san francisco where i was alone 
without even a technician twothirds of the people in the 
microbiology and immunology laboratory were working on oncogenes 
stehelin said 
this work belongs to me he said and i dont know why the 
scientific community refuses to attribute the discovery to me 
undoubtedly because working in lille is judged less prestigious 
than being a researcher in san francisco

the national endowment for the arts shaken by 
a conservative furor over subsidizing obscene art is getting a 
new chairman this week who promises to strike a balance between 
freewheeling artistic freedom and respect for the publics trust 
we are not the nations official pornographer and its 
important that the country know that said john e frohnmayer a 
47yearold lawyer from portland ore who takes command of the 
beleaguered arts endowment tuesday 
nonetheless some members of the cultural community are 
expressing fear that the bitter controversy over the endowments 
role in financing controversial art might undermine future support 
for bold innovative and unpopular artistic ventures 
the worst political crisis in the neas 24year history began 
earlier this year when conservative members of congress were 
outraged to discover that 45000 in endowment funds had been used 
to support two exhibitions they found offensive 
one featured works by the late photographer robert mapplethorpe 
that included homosexual and sadomasochistic themes and pictures of 
nude children the other show by artist andres serrano featured a 
photograph of a crucifix submerged in a container of urine 
in a surprise move jesse helms rnc won senate approval of 
his sweeping proposal to prohibit spending federal funds on 
obscene and indecent art or any work that denigrates debases 
or reviles anybody on the basis of race creed sex handicap 
age or national origin 
his amendment to the arts endowments 171 million 
appropriations bill caused a furor in the arts community and 
housesenate negotiators finally produced a compromise last week 
that contains a watereddown version of the helms proposal 
the legislation awaiting action by president bush would bar 
government financing of works that may be obscene and lack 
serious literary artistic political or scientific value the 
supreme courts 1973 guideline on obscenity 
the nea chairman however would retain authority to make final 
decisions on the artistic merit of grant applications 
also the bill earmarks 250000 for a 12member commission to 
study the neas grantmaking process to determine whether new 
standards should be adopted governing federal subsidies for 
controversial art 
its certainly going to put a chill in the air because the 
endowment is being asked not only to judge artistic quality but to 
act as a moral watchdog said martin friedman director of the 
walker art center in minneapolis 
hoping to avoid becoming embroiled in the controversy 
washingtons corcoran gallery of art canceled plans to display the 
traveling mapplethorpe exhibition last july but the move backfired 
disastrously 
the venerable museum suffered artist boycotts the resignation 
of the museums chief curator loss of a 15 million bequest from 
artist lowell nesbitt a plunge in staff morale and a tarnishing of 
the corcorans reputation as a showcase for contemporary american 
art the corcoran trustees are studying how to repair the damage 
including whether director christina orrcahall should be fired 
frohnmayer vacationing in oregon late last week said in a 
telephone interview that he intends to shift public attention from 
the mapplethorpeserrano controversy to the endowments largely 
overlooked good works in underwriting artistic excellence 
we have a very fine line to walk here between continuing 
artistic freedom and maintaining the public trust when youre 
using taxpayer dollars said frohnmayer a former chairman of the 
oregon state arts commission 
he rejects any notion that hell be coming to washington as a 
government censor but he intends to find out how we got into 
this controversy in the first place and to make sure we avoid a 
similar controversy in the future 
frohnmayer said he specifically will take steps to ensure 
greater nea control over grants to local arts institutions that 
currently dispense the money to artists at their discretion 
the mapplethorpe exhibition was organized by the university of 
pennsylvanias institute for contemporary art in philadelphia and 
partially financed by an nea grant serranos works were 
underwritten by endowment funds awarded to the southeastern center 
for contemporary art in winstonsalem nc 
frohnmayer will succeed frank hodsoll who departed in february 
as chairman of the independent federal agency which dispensed 156 
million last year to about 800 artists and 3800 arts institutions 
from major symphony orchestras and opera companies to poets folk 
artists and smalltown theater companies 
grants are awarded after an exhaustive selection process 
involving peer panel review of applicants by fellow artists 
these panels recommendations are subject to approval by the nea 
chairman and the national council on the arts the endowments 
independent presidentially appointed advisory body 
besides putting the governments imprimatur on cultural 
endeavors of the highest quality endowment officials say the 
matching grants serve as a catalyst for private financial support 
of the arts they estimate that every federal dollar spent in nea 
grants has yielded more than 5 in contributions from individuals 
corporations and foundations 
the endowment is no stranger to political controversy it has 
weathered recurring congressional hearings on its grantmaking 
process it rebuffed allegations by conservative lawmakers a few 
years ago that it was subsidizing pornographic poetry and 
wasting taxpayers money on projects to design a new bathtub and 
make clothing from sheet metal 
but livingston l biddle who drafted the legislation that 
created the arts endowment in 1965 and served as nea chairman under 
president carter said there has been nothing in my experience 
like the firestorm that erupted over mapplethorpe and serrano 
biddle is confident the helms controversy wont inhibit the 
endowments nurturing of artistic freedom but he sees an 
affirmation of john miltons warning that freedom involves 
responsibility 
what has emerged is a cautionary signal to the endowment that 
it must be alert to difficulties that could arise from the 
extremely controversial said biddle 
were all pretty worried about censorship said deborah 
butterfield a bozeman mont sculptor who serves on an endowment 
oversight panel on the visual arts 
i think its vital to preserve the voices that threaten people 
like mr helms she said the purpose of art is to make people 
look at things in a different way to solve problems in a creative 
way that is not necessarily comfortable for those in power 
richard andrews director of the university of washingtons 
henry art gallery in seattle said the really diabolical effect 
of the helms amendment will be its inhibiting influence on 
artists rather than endowment bureaucrats 
in closing house debate on the issue last week rep fred 
grandy riowa himself a former actor on televisions the love 
boat said he hoped his colleagues werent getting into the 
business of defining what is good taste and what is bad taste 
in the arts 
grandy noted mischievously that the current production of a 
local neasupported theater includes what he called transvestism 
and implied lesbian love 
the play he said is shakespeares twelfth night appearing 
at the folger shakespeare theater

solidaritys parliamentary leader monday 
urged faster changes in the mass media and depoliticizing the 
army and police 
the state which was monopolized by one party now is becoming 
the property of the nation said bronislaw geremek assessing the 
record of change 100 days after the seating of the first freely 
elected parliament in polands postwar history and the coming to 
power of a solidarityled government last month 
geremek chairman of the citizens parliamentary club that 
comprises 161 parliament deputies and 98 senators from solidarity 
said that although changes enacted so far are on a historic 
scale they still are too little compared to what society 
wants 
geremek and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the east blocs 
first noncommunist government leader are longtime coactivists 
in the solidarity movement but the parliamentary leader appeared 
willing to criticize mazowieckis government in some areas 
for instance he said not enough changes have been made in state 
television and radio mazowieckis appointee to head the state 
radiotelevision committee andrzej drawicz has been on the job 
for two weeks 
we have the right to expect acceleration of the process of 
making lies disappear from the radio and television screens 
geremek said apparently dissatisfied that only three newscasters 
prominently associated with communist party propaganda have been 
transferred to offscreen jobs 
mazowiecki and drawicz have stressed they want to avoid witch 
hunts and political purges demanding only that employees display 
competence and loyalty to the new government 
geremek said however that there still needs to be a 
psychological and political break in the personnel and style of 
news presentation 
he also blamed the government for insufficient information 
on its decisions and explaining its decisions to the public 
noting that mazowiecki had stressed the need for his government 
to be led by truth geremek said we think there is still a 
lot to be done in this field 
geremek said at a news conference that old habits persist within 
the government apparatus contrary to the governments 
intentions he cited a recent decision to exempt collective farms 
from an increase in diesel fuel prices following the communist 
tradition of giving them preferential treatment 
if we dont manage to overcome the routine of the system and 
those old constantly repeated ways of governing then even the 
best programs may turn out to be impossible he said 
the process of freeing the system from oneparty monopoly 
concerns also the army and police geremek said 
he noted that defense minister gen florian siwicki and interior 
minister gen czeslaw kiszczak both communists both agreed to 
the necessity of depoliticizing their departments 
those two great structures of the government should be freed 
from the monopoly on one party said geremek referring to the 
practice of communist party committees within the army and police 
influencing decisionmaking 
geremek also said a public debate would be launched into whether 
judges should remain members of political parties 
he also said consultations are taking place among parliamentary 
groups aimed at early passage of a constitutional amendment 
removing the clause that mandates that the communist party have the 
leading government role 
the proposed amendment which already is supported by communist 
party deputies could be taken up by the sejm the lower house of 
parliament geremek said

after many a drab season italian designers 
are bursting out in color again for the spring and summer of 1990 
for the new readytowear collections being shown this week 
milanese designers have looked beyond the city shades of gray 
black and brown to the bright colors of a mediterranean holiday 
sea blue pine green orange lemon coral and fuchsia 
no one is better at the color game than gianni versace who 
despite more than 10 years in staid milan has never lost the 
hotblooded flare of his native calabria in southern italy 
versace who presented his new collection sunday evening went 
all out with his palette for next years warmer weather combining 
a multitude of shades into beautiful silk prints for skirts pants 
jackets and dresses alike his gaily printed jump suits in posh 
silk fabric are sure to be a big hit this summer 
the daring shape of his clothes his skirts are known to be so 
short and tight they barely cover the hips and his penchant for 
theatrical styles has made him a favorite both in hollywood and 
among rock stars 
his new collection is not as sexy as past seasons but there is 
enough gold and glitz to satisfy even the most demanding 
entertainer 
not only are his styles vivid but they are adorned with 
hundreds of gold balls tassels and colorful crystals as if that 
werent enough he sticks on a fringe here and there and decorates 
his shoes with gold studs 
it is a strong statement but versaces exquisite tailoring and 
artisitic sense keep it on this side of a fashion circus 
among the new styles high waisted silk pants with one leg slit 
up to the hip mini lingerie dresses in bright shades of teffeta 
bra tops and bustiers encrusted in colorful crystals silk printed 
lapels on man tailored jackets fringed piano shawls to drape over 
the shoulders or tie around the hips

checks and polka dots in carefree silk sun dresses and pinafores to 
be worn over crisp white linen dresses

a meeting on wildlife trade opened 
monday with the admission that a plan to control ivory sales is not 
working and african elephant populations are suffering an alarming 
decline 
prince bernhard of the netherlands told 800 delegates and 
observers at a 10day session of the convention on international 
trade in endangered species that supporters of the ivory quota 
system must admit that it has failed to control the illegal ivory 
trade 
bernhard president of the world wide fund for nature warned 
delegates of alarming census reports you must give benefit of 
the doubt to the survival of the species he said 
the convention issued an infractions report detailing how 
african countries especially zaire and gabon had flouted 
nonivory wildlife trade restrictions 
the report also singled out argentina spain japan and 
thailand among others for failing to comply with convention 
regulations on other species it mentioned only the most flagrant 
abuses it said indicating widespread problems in policing 
international trade 
a separate report dealt with ivory the heart of the wildlife 
trade issue 
delegates from 103 convention nations must decide whether to 
leave elephants under their present designation as threatened 
species or list them as an endangered species which would force a 
ban on ivory trade 
ivory fetches more than 150 a pound on world markets 
the united states canada and the 12nation european economic 
community halted imports in june 
zimbabwe south africa and botswana argue that careful 
management has increased their elephant herds and entitles them to 
sell tusks to finance their game reserves zimbabwe says it earns 
9 million a year by selling ivory from herds estimated at 52000 
but east african states say herds have been reduced 
continentwide from 13 million in a decade to just more than 
600000 and can only be protected by a ban that applies to the 
entire continent 
in july kenya burned 2500 poached ivory tusks worth 3 million 
to draw attention to the slaughter of elephants across the 
continent kenyas population had declined from 65000 in the 1970s 
to about 17000 today 
environmentalists say poachers kill at least 70000 elephants a 
year and that poorer nations such as kenya and do not have the 
resources to stop wellarmed poachers many of whom come from 
neighboring countries 
connie harriman a us assistant secretary of the interior and 
head of the american delegation said a partial ban would create 
a loophole which would allow continued illegal trade we have no 
flexibility 
other delegates agreed suggesting that eastern africa might 
muster the required twothirds majority to change the elephants 
status to endangered 
but others rallied around southern africa we must respect the 
africans wishes said kiyohiko arafune of the japanese 
delegation which favors limited ivory trade 
convention secretarygeneral eugene lapointe suggested a split 
listing that would ban trade where elephant populations are at risk 
but allow quotas for south africa zimbabwe and botswana 
the world wide fund for nature and the international union for 
the conservation of nature backed a ban but left room for maneuver 
we would support a split listing with a moratorium to gain 
time said tom milliken of traffic an enforcement group 
associated with the conservation groups the alternative is to 
back southern africa to the wall so they file reservations and 
open the door to abuse 
the conventions rulings are nonlegally binding agreements that 
rely on international pressure for enforcement convention members 
are allowed to file a socalled reservation to bypass guidelines 
for an individual species 
the position of the conservation groups was met by anger from a 
range of other environmentalist groups mostly from the united 
states that have lobbied for an immediate ban 
we should stand together on what is necessary and let 
governments do the compromising said sue lieberman of the humane 
society of the united states its incredible when official us 
and british positions are stronger than some environmentalists 
greenpeace spokesman andrew davis said the compromise 
approach has meant the death of hundreds of thousands of african 
elephants only a total ban with a really concerted effort to 
shut down the markets can save the elephants 
simon lyster head of the world wide fund for natures 19person 
delegation said our objective is a total ban but we are not 
wedded to the mechanism 
he blamed individual nations for a gross failure to enforce 
regulation and said the convention lacked the resources to fulfill 
its mandate lyster also said that even a total ban would not be 
enough 
we must make the wearing of ivory using of ivory as socially 
unacceptable as wearing a cheetahskin coat he said

the countdown for this weeks 
planned launch of space shuttle atlantis began monday as nasa 
headed for a court showdown with antinuclear activists seeking to 
stop the flight because of its plutoniumpowered payload 
if a federal judge approves atlantis is to blast off at 129 
pm thursday with five astronauts who are to dispatch the galileo 
spacecraft with its nuclear generators on the start of a sixyear 
journey to jupiter 
a band of 25 protesters demonstrated monday at the kennedy space 
center played out a mock death scene and vowed that if they are 
turned down by the court they will sit on the launch pad if 
necessary to halt the launch 
attorneys for the space agency and three citizens groups are to 
present oral arguments tuesday before us district judge oliver 
gasch in washington 
the launch opponents contend that an explosion on liftoff could 
spread cancercausing plutonium over a large area of eastcentral 
florida 
nasa officials argue the two nuclear generators aboard the 
galileo spacecraft have been thoroughly tested and that flying them 
poses minimal health and environmental risks similar devices have 
flown on 22 other us spacecraft without a problem 
were going to count down to a launch on thursday unless we 
are told to stop nasa test director ron phelps said monday as 
the countdown got under way he described atlantis as in terrific 
shape 
the astronauts assigned to the mission flew here monday from 
their training base in houston for final flight preparations all 
five have said they are not worried about the plutonium in the 
cargo bay 
my family is going to be down there watching the launch as 
well as other people that i love and so im not concerned about 
it i feel its safe said ellen baker one of the crew members 
the others are commander donald williams pilot mike mcculley 
franklin changdiaz and shannon lucid 
the protesters began their demonstration monday with a mock 
countdown that ended with a woman spreading in the air dustlike 
particles representing plutonium the participants all fell to the 
ground in makebelieve death 
were going to attempt to put people of the launch pad if the 
court doesnt prevent the launch bruce gagnon one of the 
protest leaders told reporters 
gagnon would not disclose how the demonstraters would breach 
security to reach the pad but he said the effort to be made 
wednesday or thursday or both would be nonviolent he is 
coordinator for the florida coalition for peace and justice one of 
the three groups that sued 
more than 200 security guards armed with m16 assault rifles and 
semiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the 140000acre space center 
to stop infiltrators and the center also will be guarded by 
helicopters and boats 
but there is only a 10minute launch window available on 
thursday and nasa is concerned the time would be consumed if 
protesters penetrate the launch danger zone with a boat plane or 
on foot in the final minutes of the countdown

legislators on monday gave soviet workers the 
legal right to strike the first such measure in the nations 
history 
following a daylong debate the supreme soviet legislature 
passed the complex measure that bans strikes by workers in almost a 
dozen sectors but also provides other workers with a legal 
framework under which to strike 
the soviet unions need for a such a labor law became urgent 
this summer when hundreds of thousands of coal miners went on 
strike for better working conditions and political change 
stoppages based on ethnic conflicts also have become 
commonplace with thousands of russian workers in moldavia and 
estonia walking out recently to protest laws they viewed as 
disciminatory 
although they were not expressly forbidden by soviet law the 
few strikes that broke out in recent years were brutally 
suppressed president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms opened the 
door to louder labor demands and he backed the law that will 
provide labor conflicts a legal framework 
only 12 supreme soviet deputies of more than 400 voted against 
the strike bill with 10 members abstaining tass reported 
the news agency said the law prohibits strikes that create a 
threat to peoples lives and health as well as work stoppages by 
workers in railroads public transportation civil aviation 
communications energy defense government bodies law enforcement 
and roundtheclock production industries 
it also forbids strikes connected with the putting forth of 
demands for a violent overthrow or change of the government or 
social system and also demands involving the violation of ethnic 
or racial equality tass said 
in order to hold a legal strike a union must first give a 
conciliatory commission made up of representatives of both 
labor and management five days to attempt to resolve the dispute 
if that fails the sides must give arbitration seven days to work 
things out only then with all other options exhausted does it 
have the right to strike 
deputies to the supreme soviet the soviet legislature that was 
a mere rubber stamp until gorbachevs reforms gave it real power 
contested many of the laws provisions monday and voted on some 50 
proposed amendments 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov called for some type of 
acceptable political strike to be written into the law but his 
proposal was defeated on a procedural technicality tass reported 
several deputies complained that too many sectors were 
prohibited from striking under the new law those sectors can 
appeal to the supreme soviet with their complaints 
the law comes on the heels of an emergency measure passed by the 
supreme soviet on oct 3 banning strikes until the general law 
could be passed 
the coal strikes last summer which paralyzed much of the 
countrys crucial coal industry and were stemmed only after the 
government conceded on virtually all the miners demands appeared 
to be the greatest crisis gorbachev had faced in more than four 
years 
although he expressed sympathy for the miners he has said 
repeatedly such strikes could lead to anarchy and an economic crash 
for the soviet union

bahamanian prime minister lynden pindling at 
odds with nbc over allegations about drug smuggling has canceled a 
wednesday appearance on the networks today show to discuss the 
libel lawsuit he dropped 
pindling on friday accused the network of violating an agreement 
by announcing earlier in the day that he had dropped his lawsuit 
filed in toronto in 1984 against nbc and correspondent brian ross 
the 4 million lawsuit which also named as defendants 16 
canadian cable and communications companies stemmed from nbc 
nightly news broadcasts in 1983 and 1984 about a cocaine cartel 
nbc said was operating in the bahamas 
the broadcasts quoted us authorities as saying the cocaine 
operation was protected by payoffs to bahamanian officials 
pindling whom nbc said repeatedly declined requests for 
interviews before dropping his lawsuit has denied nbcs 
allegations that he was among those officials 
in a statement friday in which he said pindling received neither 
money nor an apology from nbc for the broadcasts nbc news 
president michael gartner said nbc was delighted that pindling 
dropped his lawsuit 
this is a complete vindication of our journalism he said 
pindling later charged that nbcs statements violated a 
confidentiality agreement on the lawsuit and distorted the terms 
under which it was dropped nbc denied both accusations friday and 
again monday 
pindling may reinstate the canadian court lawsuit and a lawsuit 
in us courts hasnt been ruled out his spokesman william 
kalis said monday 
pindling was to appear on today to discuss in general 
terms the friday settlement kalis said from nassau but he 
canceled when nbc abrogated the settlement he said 
in an interview made before fridays developments and broadcast 
sunday on cbs 60 minutes pindling said he first sued nbc in 
his own countrys courts and won the case by default because 
nbc didnt respond 
kalis said no money was awarded in that case 
after that pindling said in the cbs broadcast i decided to 
sue in a neutral jurisdiction referring to canada 
the matter of reinstating pindlings lawsuit is being discussed 
by his attorneys kalis said but because monday was a holiday 
thanksgiving in canada he said there probably wont be a 
decision until tomorrow

arab league mediators struggled monday 
to salvage a peace plan aimed at ending lebanons civil war and 
one of the lebanese lawmakers gathered for negotiations said they 
were making headway 
saeb salam a sunni moslem said the threeman arab league 
committee was trying to devise a mechanism that would guarantee 
implementation of the peace plan 
lebanons 33 christian and 30 moslem parliament members have 
been meeting in this saudi resort since sept 30 to try to end 
their nations 14yearold war 
hardline christian deputies who owe allegiance to maronite 
catholic leader gen michel aoun are demanding guarantees that 
syria pull out its 40000 troops from lebanon before they will 
cooperate 
the demand has blocked parliament sessions for four days and 
the arab league committee sought help from arab and other powers 
including the united states the soviet union and france 
the contacts of the tripartite committee are moving very 
well salam told reporters in taif 
the members of the committee are king fahd of saudi arabia king 
hassan ii of morocco and president chadli bendjedid of algeria 
salam did not elaborate but said the deputies and the mediators 
were doing everything to make the conference succeed 
the 87yearold deputy declared tearfully that i affirm to my 
brothers in lebanon that success is inevitable and failure is 
forbidden 
moslem legislators who support the syrians want more power in 
lebanons christiandominated government 
under the peace plan presented by the arab mediators 
sectarianism would be abolished gradually as law and order were 
restored 
syrian forces in beirut would be withdrawn over two years and 
relocated in the bekaa valley in eastern lebanon a full pullout 
would follow a security pact between beirut and damascus 
the christians want the syrians out within six months but many 
moslems insist there can be no withdrawal until the maronites agree 
to surrender some of the power they have held since lebanons 
independence from france in 1943 
under an unwritten covenant the president has always been a 
maronite catholic the prime minister a sunni moslem and the 
parliament speaker a shiite 
at independence the christians were considered the majority 
but moslems now make up an estimated 55 percent of the 4 million 
population 
in beirut the annahar newspaper reported that the arab league 
committee was pressing the lebanese legislators to meet deadlines 
it has set for elections 
the daily said the committee proposed oct 25 as the date for a 
parliament session in beirut to elect a speaker with another 
session soon afterward to endorse reforms agreed to in taif 
parliament would reconvene nov 5 to elect a new president the 
newspaper said 
the latest round of fighting in lebanon began in march when aoun 
launched a war of liberation against the syrians six months of 
fierce artillery battles killed more than 900 people before a 
ceasefire brokered by the arab league took hold sept 22 
the syrian troops moved into lebanon in 1976 the year after the 
civil war broke out under an arab league peacekeeping mandate 
aoun alleges the syrians lost their mandate by openly siding 
with the moslems

president ranasinghe premadasa has 
invited the red cross to send officials to sri lanka to help ease 
the conflict between sinhalese rebels and the government an 
official statement said monday 
a statement issued by the presidential secretariat said the red 
cross officials will help trace missing persons visit detention 
centers and provide relief to people affected by violence 
the invitation follows charges by human rights groups that 
progovernment vigilante organizations are responsible for a wave 
of killings mostly of young sinhalese men believed to be 
sympathizers of radicals 
the government has denied the charges and blames the radicals 
for most of the 5000 deaths reported since the sinhalese extremist 
movement began in july 1987 
in its latest violence report monday the government reported 43 
killings the victims included 16 young sinhalese men found dead in 
the spot where the peoples liberation front a sinhalese extremist 
group ambushed an army patrol last week 
the government blamed vigilantes who they said were 
outraged by attacks on government troops for the 16 killings 
officials also blamed vigilantes for killing three men whose 
bodies were found monday at moratuwa 11 miles south of colombo 
all 19 victims died of gunshot wounds military officials said 
they estimated the victims ages at between 18 and 30 
thirteen sinhalese extremists were shot and killed during a 
series of government operations in the past 24 hours against the 
peoples liberation front in central and southern sri lanka the 
government said 
the communique issued by the governments information 
department said large quantities or arms and ammunition were 
recovered in the operations 
members of the sinhalese front killed 11 civilians in the past 
24 hours the military officials said they said most of the 
victims were officials or supporters of the government 
the front has been attacking the sinhalesedominated government 
for two years since the government agreed to an accord designed to 
give greater autonomy to sri lankas tamil minority 
the peoples liberation front espouses marxism but increasingly 
has taken up a banner of ultranationalism for the sinhalese who 
are mostly buddhists and comprise 75 percent of the countrys 16 
million people 
tamils who account for 18 percent of the population are mainly 
hindus and began fighting six years ago for an independent 
homeland 
predominantly hindu india spurred by its own tamil minority 
tried to broker an agreement to end sinhalesetamil violence but 
instead got bogged down in its own war with tamil guerrillas when 
it tried to disarm them

the united states will continue producing new 
chemical weapons over a 10year period even if it signs an 
international treaty to abolish all poison gas stockpiles an 
administration official said monday 
the text of the treaty being negotiated by about 40 nations in 
geneva proposes that all production be stopped immediately and that 
the plants be rendered inoperable 
however the administration will seek modifications to ensure 
that it can keep its stockpiles up to date even as it scales them 
down said the official who declined to be identified 
president bush in a sept 25 speech to the united nations said 
that once a global treaty is signed the united states will destroy 
98 percent of its chemical weapons over an eightyear period if 
the soviet union takes idetical action 
bush said the remaining stockpiles would be destroyed over the 
next two years if all nations capable of building chemical 
weapons sign that total ban treaty 
the us stockpile consists of unitary weapons many of 
which are leaking and deemed unsafe and newer binary weapons 
that use two components to make them lethal 
congress has instructed the administration to destroy the 
unitary weapons as the newer binary weapons are produced 
you dont want to get eight years down the road and have only 
unitary leaking old weapons left the official said as long 
as youre going to have any you ought to try to make sure the ones 
you have are as safe as possible 
the official said the us intention of continuing to produce 
the weapons during the phaseout period was made known to soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze during talks last month in 
wyoming with secretary of state james a baker iii

a rundown lutheran church in a shabby section of 
east berlin has become the rallying point for oncedisparate 
opposition groups aiming for historic reforms in their communist 
homeland 
outside gethsemane church there were violent clashes in recent 
days as police moved in to crush peaceful protests for democratic 
reform public support for change has swelled in the city and other 
parts of east germany in recent weeks 
nationwide protests the past three days have been the largest 
since 1953 when soviet tanks helped put down a popular uprising 
the wave of unrest came as the communist government held 
elaborately choreographed state ceremonies marking the nations 
40th anniversary 
like st brygidas church in gdansk which became the focal 
point of solidarity activities in poland the weathered 19th 
century gethsemane church is a magnet for activists to discuss 
strategy and political platforms 
we come here because we want peaceful change and because there 
is nowhere else where we can find sanctuary said an east berlin 
human rights activist in her 20s 
the church became the center for dissidents after protesters 
began a vigil and fast last week for imprisoned activists 
when police charge protesters to disperse them hundreds flee to 
the legal sanctuary of the fencedin church grounds 
scores of others often spend the night inside fearing they will 
be arrested if they attempt to leave 
although the lutheran church in east germany has long pursued an 
uneasy policy of coexistence with the state it has also provided a 
haven for independent human rights and ecology groups 
its leadership has urged the government to enter into a dialogue 
with dissident groups and many pastors have become increasing 
vocal in their criticism of the hardline leaderships rejection of 
reforms 
thousands of supporters stream to the redbrick gethsemane 
church each day to hold rallies and to learn of the latest 
developments from the growing opposition network around the country 
hundreds of candles glitter at the entrance to show solidarity 
with those arrested and imprisoned in demonstrations across the 
country 
banners calling for peace and freedom flap from the churchs 
scaffolded steeple pastors scurry about helping with logistics 
and urging those assembled to avoid violence 
activists standing on the chipped concrete steps pass plastic 
buckets around to collect donations for opposition causes 
hardline communist authorities have deployed hundreds of 
security officials surrounding the church to prevent groups from 
heading to main thoroughfares they fear the daily rallies will 
snowball into mass demonstrations like those that erupted over last 
weekend 
uniformed police officers check the identity papers of those 
attempting to reach the church 
the area has been declared offlimits to western television 
crews and news photographers since sunday western reporters were 
refused access again monday 
east germanys opposition movement has long been plagued by 
intense government suppression security officials routinely 
harrass its members and emerging leaders have been frequently 
expelled to west germany 
the groups have been fractious and small and until recently 
were only able to achieve a loose countrywide network many began 
as ecological and peace discussion groups 
but the groups have become increasing bolder buoyed by reforms 
in the soviet union poland and hungary 
growing frustration over the governments intransigence to 
change and the recent exodus of tens of thousands of east germans 
to west germany has also spurred many prodemocracy supporters to 
broader public activism 
last week seven prodemocracy and rights groups signed a joint 
declaration saying they would work together so that all east 
germans have the right to exercise their political rights 
we have a duty to demand from the state and party leadership 
that they restore the peoples confidence in the government said 
werner fischer a founder of one of east germanys oldest human 
rights groups

two university of california cancer 
researchers won the nobel prize in medicine monday and immediately 
reaped the perquisites of success box seats at the national league 
baseball playoffs 
were off to the game just got tickets a jubilant j 
michael bishop said shortly after he and harold e varmus learned 
that they had won this years prize 
the 50member nobel assembly of the karolinska institute 
swedens largest and oldest medical university cited bishop and 
varmus for their discovery that cancer genes in certain viruses are 
altered forms of normal animal genes 
the research helped scientists understand how cancer begins and 
it widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which 
govern the normal growth of cells the assembly said 
varmus called the research a cornerstone in understanding the 
genetic mosaic of cancer 
the basic idea that we helped establish is that cancer has its 
origins in genes that normally do us some good but after they 
become abnormal through mutation they cause a role in cancer he 
said 
the two scienists are colleagues at the university of california 
school of medicine in san francisco they originally published 
their prizewinning findings in 1976 
bishop said winning the award was surreal while varmus it 
was startling when the telephone began ringing at 4 am 
we just assumed one of the grandparents had some trouble so 
we were frightened he said 
but his alarm quickly turned to exultation especially when the 
469000 award to be split between the two began paying off in 
unexpected ways 
when reporters swarmed to his home early in the morning varmus 
had said he only wished he could use the nobel money to buy tickets 
to the soldout championship game between the san francisco giants 
and the chicago cubs at candlestick park 
a short time later he received four free tickets compliments of 
the san francisco examiner uc spokesman robert sanders said 
bishop already had his own tickets 
at a news conference at the university of california medical 
center bishop and varmus were optimistic about the practical 
applications of their work how it helps understand the nature of 
cancer and possibly some aspects of the aids virus 
but they were cautious about forecasting a cancer cure in the 
foreseeable future 
this is just another step in whats a long journey bishop 
said its very difficult to predict when a full view of the 
cancer cell will be at hand 
although varmus stressed that he and bishop stand on the 
shoulders of those who came before us at least one scientist 
said he resented carrying their weight 
dr dominique stehelin a french researcher who carried out 
experiments overseen by bishop and varmus at san francisco in the 
1970s said it was very unfair and rotten that he wasnt 
included in the prize 
i did the work all by myself from a to z stehelin told the 
french news agency agence francepresse 
bishop and varmus called stehelins work crucial to their 
research but referred questions about the prize to the nobel 
committee 
we didnt nominate each other varmus said 
you may know youre in the running but nevertheless there 
are a lot of other good people in there too its a shock 
said varmus dressed casually in blue jeans and a red and white 
striped shirt and a light beard that was apparently the result of 
a hasty shaving job 
varmus 49 who once hoped to become an english professor said 
he abandoned his studies of 17th century literature to attend 
medical school he said he switched fields after learning that 
writer gertrude stein had enrolled at johns hopkins medical school 
after being told that medicine opens all doors 
gradually he discovered he enjoyed being in the laboratory more 
than the clinic and his research career began he said 
my mother died of breast cancer but i dont know if that in 
itself caused me to study the cause of cancer theres hardly 
anybody in this room who is not touched by cancer somehow varmus 
said 
bishop 53 said he was interested in science in high school 
and decided to become a doctor but he said that by the time i 
finished college i wasnt so sure i wanted to be a doctor 
it was a rural pennsylvania general practioner robert kough 
who became his mentor and convinced him that his calling was in 
medical research 
both bishop and varmus said they plan to return to the lab and 
they dont expect their lives to be dramatically altered by the 
nobel prize 
i like my life the way it is and i hope it stays that way 
varmus said the danger is youre supposed to be smarter today 
than you were yesterday and im not

pope john paul ii began a visit to the 
worlds most populous moslem nation monday with a message of 
friendship and assurances that his roman catholic flock was loyal 
to indonesia 
in an atmosphere of controversy over a scheduled stop in east 
timor a predominantly catholic former portuguese territory annexed 
by indonesia in 1976 john paul sought to make clear that catholics 
were no threat to the archipelagos unity 
i have come as a friend to all indonesians with a great 
respect for all the people of this dynamic nation he said 
a tropical rainstorm drenched the city of nearly 8 million as 
the pope arrived after a 7hour flight from seoul south korea 
john paul knelt and kissed the wet tarmac in sticky 90degree heat 
soldiers lined the 10mile motorcade route from the military 
airport to the presidential palace set in a ring of palm trees he 
was greeted by president suharto indonesias prowestern leader 
there have been reports of several threats to the pontiffs life 
by moslem extremists in this nation of 13766 islands and about 200 
ethnic and religious groups john paul sought to make clear that 
his visit and the 5 million catholics among indonesias 157 
million moslems pose no threat 
during a mass at a sports stadium built by the soviets under 
president sukarno who led indonesia to independence from the 
netherlands in 1949 john paul expressed cordial esteem to 
our moslem brothers and sisters who are so numerous in this 
country 
i extend the hand of sincere and heartfelt friendship in our 
common belief in the one god our creator and merciful lord he 
said speaking in english 
john paul said catholic indonesians were deeply proud of their 
country 
we must be fully catholic and fully indonesian he said 
these words are deeply inscribed in the modern history of the 
nation 
in an exchange of speeches with suharto at an evening reception 
the pope touched lightly on the issue of human rights stressing 
that respect for individual rights is essential for the unity of a 
nation 
suharto said men should seek to share identical things and 
not to aggravate differences among them 
portugal has criticized the stop in east timor scheduled for 
thursday but john paul says the visit does not imply vatican 
recognition of the indonesian takeover 
he told reporters on the trip from seoul that skipping the 
island would be an offense to east timors catholics who the 
vatican says number nearly 80 percent of the 690000 people 
the pope is scheduled to leave indonesia on saturday for the 
island nation of mauritius in the indian ocean and return to rome 
two days later

striking boeing machinists met with 25 other 
labor unions monday to ask for their support while their sixday 
walkout against the airplane manufacturer dragged on with no signs 
of new contract talks 
were here to brief the other unions to what our strike is all 
about so well be prepared for monetary support and those types 
of things if hardship needs arise said tom baker president of 
the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
local 751 
the strike is affecting boeing plants in the seattle area 
wichita kan portland ore and several other sites 
in wichita where boeing military airplanes has its 
headquarters hundreds of strikers rallied monday before joining 
pickets for a peaceful show of force at plant gates there was a 
similar rally in everett wash where the popular 747s and 767s 
are built 
one wichita hourly employee who has been crossing picket lines 
reported his car was vandalized during the weekend local strike 
coordinator ray briggs said the union doesnt sanction property 
damage or injury and that there is no proof the vandalism happened 
because of the strike 
baker dismissed the teamsters decision to cross picket lines 
saying that wouldnt affect the 57800 striking machinists ability 
to halt production at the worlds largest commercial jet builder 
boeing officials were in a meeting monday and did not 
immediately return telephone calls from the associated press 
federal mediator doug hammond left a recording on his answering 
machine saying no talks were scheduled 
boeing has delivered two planes since the strike began 
wednesday before the strike boeing was committed to delivering 57 
jets before the end of the year five consecutive years of record 
orders have given the company a backlog that stretches into the 
late 1990s 
that backlog and the steady stream of overtime which employees 
have been asked to work were behind machinists demand for better 
wages and less overtime 
boeing earned 356 million on sales of 907 billion for the 
first half of 1989 and had profits of 614 million on sales of 
1696 billion in 1988 
boeings offer featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with 
3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991 and annual bonuses of 8 
percent of a workers gross earnings this year and 3 percent in 
1990 mandatory overtime would be reduced from 200 hours per 
quarter to 160 hours and the costofliving formula would be 
improved to account for virtually all inflation 
boeing said a machinist in a middle skill grade such as an 
engine mechanic could see pay go from 34389 this year to 43138 
in 1992 counting seniority and costofliving increases but 
excluding 13000 in bonuses and any overtime 
the machinists who have seen bonuses but no increases in their 
base wage for six years said that was not enough 
they need airplanes delivered and we want to get back and 
deliver them but we want our fair share and thats what were 
atempting to get baker said 
it is the machinists first strike against boeing since a 45day 
walkout in 1977 
what happens at boeing could affect labor talks at other 
aerospace plants talks have been extended in a machinists contract 
that expired sunday with lockheed corp in marietta ga the 
unions contract with mcdonnell douglas expires oct 22

an unemployed drifter pleaded guilty 
monday to kidnapping an 11yearold girl and told authorities he 
accidentally killed her nearly 2 years ago and buried her in 
georgia 
the plea by charles blassingame 43 averted a trial scheduled 
to begin monday but a prosecutor said more charges are possible in 
the july 1987 disappearance of tammy lynn maciulis 
district attorney tim duket said he does not believe 
blassingames account of the childs death 
the prosecution reserves the right to charge him with 
firstdegree or seconddegree murder if in fact he takes us to 
the body and through scientific or forensic evidence it can be 
proven the death was not of an accidental nature duket said 
lawyers said the plea agreement calls for blassingame to serve 
25 years in prison on the kidnapping charge if the body is not 
located blassingame has agreed to plead guilty to an extortion 
charge involving an unrelated incident and will serve an additional 
six years in prison 
circuit judge john hoffmann accepted the agreement but delayed 
sentencing until authorities search for the body blassingame 
agreed to accompany officials to georgia for the search officials 
said 
blassingame told authorities he accidentally struck and killed 
tammy with his car then placed her body in a duffel bag drove to 
georgia and buried her in woods near dalton ga 
the agreement was reached during negotiations over the weekend 
between the defendant defense attorney royce finne duket and 
marinette police chief patrick ravet who said he lt jeff skorik 
blassingame and finne will fly to georgia on tuesday to search for 
tammys body 
authorities said they consulted with tammys mother phyllis 
nicklaus and she had no objections to the plea agreement 
tammy lynn disappeared from her mothers marinette apartment in 
july 1987 touching off a nationwide search 
blassingame was originally charged with kidnapping enticing a 
minor for immoral purposes and attempted seconddegree sexual 
assault but the latter two counts were dropped in the plea 
bargain the attempted sex assault charge was for an incident 
involving a teenage neighbor of the maciulis family authorities 
said 
according to authorities at the time of tammys disappearance 
she and her mother and sister were living at the same apartment 
complex where blassingame was living with a woman 
blassingame said he was driving out of town when he discovered 
tammy in the back seat of his car 
he said tammy asked him to drive her to her fathers home near 
chicago blassingame said that because he had a criminal record he 
became scared and told her to return home 
he said that when he turned his car around she was standing in 
the way and was struck and stopped breathing 
blassingame said he dumped clothing out of a duffel bag put her 
body in it and headed south 
finne the defense attorney said blassingames plea was 
appropriate 
the defendant faces strong evidence of conviction and he 
legally acknowledges the strength of the states case but not 
necessarily beyond a reasonable doubt he said 
duket said the agreement was also in the best interest of the 
state because the case was based mostly on circumstantial evidence 
i am happy with the agreement i am happy the defendant will 
do a significant amount of prison time but i am disappointed out 
case wasnt strong enough to proceed to trial without any 
reservations

reszoe nyers who was elected monday as 
president of the new hungarian socialist party was also chairman 
of the nowdissolved communist party and is one of the most 
experienced politicians and economists in hungary 
we are breaking with the exercise of power along the lines 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat nyers 66 told delegates 
to the congress on sunday a day after the new party was 
established 
a printer by trade nyers joined the hungarian social democratic 
party early on after the party merged with the communists in 1948 
he was a party secretary then studied economics 
a champion of political reform and an experienced economist who 
believes in a socialist market economy nyers was voted into 
the politburo in may 1988 
it was a stunning political comeback after many years in 
political limbo and came as the result of a major reshuffle that 
saw longtime party chief janos kadar ousted and replaced by karoly 
grosz 
whoever is a reform communist or a eurocommunist and accepts 
the fact that the party has to be of a socialist nature can 
be a member of a new kind of socialist party nyers was quoted as 
saying sunday making it clear most communists can join it 
nyers history of managing economic and financial affairs dates 
to 1960 when he became finance minister a job he held until 1962 
as a member of the partys ruling politburo nyers became known 
as the father of the pioneering economic reforms that gave 
hungarians the highest living standards in eastern europe in the 
late 1960s and early 1970s 
but in 1974 nyers was dropped from the politburo and stripped 
of his economics post as kadar put a brake on reforms that 
apparently alarmed leonid i brezhnev who then was in power in 
moscow 
nyers vast experience was the reason for his appointment last 
november as special economics minister to steer hungary through a 
period of austerity 
now he will have to steer the new party through a period of 
political transition and help it compete in the first multiparty 
elections next year

president carlos salinas de gortari 
said monday he will end a governmentcontrolled monopoly on the 
importation and sale of inexpensive newsprint in mexico 
the monopoly has been used in past years to retaliate against 
newspapers that failed to toe the government or ruling 
institutional revolutionary partys line by making it difficult or 
expensive for dissidents to buy newsprint elsewhere 
allow me to announce that once we sell pipsa we will allow 
free and total importation of newsprint and thus avoid a monopoly 
by certain groups that could affect freedom of press expression 
salinas told 450 members of the interamerican press association 
meeting in this northern mexico city 
salinas was greeted with a standing ovation and shouts of 
bravo bravo when he announced the sale of productora e 
importadora de papel sa de cv popularly known by its spanish 
initials of pipsa which is jointly owned by the government and 
longestablished newspapers 
salinas did not give any deadline for the sale in his speech at 
the opening session of iapas 45th annual general assembly in this 
nuevo leon state capital about 150 miles south of laredo texas 
iapa has about 1300 members in the united states canada latin 
america and the caribbean 
pipsa was founded by president lazaro cardenas in 1935 when 
world prices of newsprint skyrocketed and mexican publishers were 
hard pressed for money 
it imported newsprint dutyfree and distributed it among 
affiliated newspapers virtually all of which were sympathetic to 
the institutional revolutionary party 
when pipsas charter expired in 1965 the members voted to renew 
it for another 30 years 
but salinas has been pressing for the monopolys dissolution 
since he took office dec 1 as part of a campaign to cut 
government subsidies and encourage competition in the free market 
and greater press freedom in mexico 
many established publishers said they favored continuing pipsa 
when salinas first announced publicly that his administration was 
in favor of reopening the newsprint market 
but many more especially provincial newspapers said they 
were all for it 
its a magnificent measure jose healy executive editor of 
el imparcial of northwestern sonora state said in an interview he 
said pipsa has been a weapon that the government can use at any 
moment 
without subsidized newsprint some papers can find it difficult 
to survive especially in the saturated mexico city market 
in his speech salinas said his administration will follow a 
policy of strict respect for freedom of expression and 
provide maximum security for mexican journalists 
a modern government accepts criticism salinas said adding 
that such criticism spurs administrations to correct or improve 
their policies 
a total of 29 mexican journalists were slain during president 
miguel de la madrids sixyear administration that preceded salinas 
government spokesmen said most of the killings were common 
crimes involving disputes or holdups but journalists have 
insisted they had political motives 
the only case brought to trial so far is that of manuel buendia 
a frontpage columnist for the newspaper excelsior he was shot on 
a mexico city street in may 1984 and his assassination remained a 
mystery until a federal security chief and an agent were arrested 
last june 
prosecutors say buendia was shot because he had uncovered a 
federal security officials role in drug trafficking 
several others were also arrested and are on trial as 
conspirators in the case but there is continued speculation that a 
coverup has concealed the roles of highranking de la madrid 
administration officials 
advances and setbacks in press freedom in latin america were 
among the major topics for discussion by the association on monday 
eduardo ulibarri vice president of the associations press 
freedom and information committee singled out colombia and panama 
as the two most critical cases this year

authorities on monday quarantined 
three mixedbreed dogs that attacked and killed a 73yearold woman 
as she picked up a newspaper in her front yard 
a neighbor used a baseball bat to run off the dogs but frances 
fletcher died shortly after the attack sunday 
the state attorneys office monday was considering criminal 
charges against sidney bodie and scherrie laramore neighbors who 
owned the dogs jacksonville sheriffs spokesman asa higgs said 
the three dogs one of them pregnant were held in the county 
pound 
were holding them until we get word from the state said 
john hartley animal control supervisor under normal 
circumstances they would be held in quarantine for 10 days to 
determine if they had rabies then released to their owners 
the county would hold on to the dogs if charges were filed 
against their owners hartley said 
county officials initially identified the animals as english 
bulldogs a small pugnosed breed arousing the ire of owners 
and breeders of the dogs who contend they are not as aggressive as 
pit bulls 
hartley said monday that animal control officials were not sure 
of the breed 
were saying theyre mixed bulldogs hartley said it 
could be english and pit theyve got a little bit of everything 
other experts disputed the identification 
it was told to me that they were english bulldogs but they 
were definitely not said phil snyder executive director of the 
jacksonville humane society they look like pit bull terriers or 
mixedbreed pit bulls

at a time when the price of theater 
tickets is soaring beyond the reach of many trinity repertory 
theater will try a onenight experiment tuesday of letting patrons 
pay what they will 
the objective is is to give everyone an opportunity to come to 
the theater said e timothy langan managing director of the 
theater company 
the normal ticket price for the preview performance of maxim 
gorkys summerfolk a story langan described as one about the 
russian empires version of yuppies before the 1917 revolution is 
24 based on similar experiments in baltimore and san diego 
langan said he expected people would be willing to pay 3 to 4 
but thats ok he said the whole purpose of this is for 
someone to be comfortable in coming to the theater 
patrons can pay as little as they want the only rule is no 
freebies he said but langan wouldnt mind if someone decided the 
theater really was worth more than 24 a ticket 
awardwinning theaters like trinity which started in a church 
25 years ago face pressures to mount increasingly expensive 
productions 
i think that some people have perceived that weve become less 
affordable langan said but there is a great pressure to 
produce quality shows and then the discussion gets into money and 
then theres pressure on ticket prices 
with a large artistic community centered at the rhode island 
school of design and brown university langan said he expected many 
of those taking advantage of the nameyourownprice offer would be 
close to the starving artist stereotype 
trinity has set aside 5000 from a grant to cover projected 
losses the theater and its new artistic director anne bogart 
hope to find sponsors for similar nights but already it must seek 
outside helpto meet regular expenses because even the 24 regular 
price for weekday performances doesnt make ends meet langan said 
only weekend theatergoers who pay 30 actually cover the costs 
of the 550seat theater he said trinity with student and other 
discounts averages about 20 a ticket

the army arrived monday to help clear 
away mountains of tinderdry debris damaged furniture and 
destroyed appliances that litter lawns and homes devastated by 
hurricane hugo 
in central south carolina landfills are overflowing with trash 
from hurricane cleanup efforts and officials searched for 
temporary dumps 
charleston mayor joseph p riley jr said he hoped much of the 
debris in his city could be cleared in two weeks but army officers 
were not as optimistic 
we could have people cleaning up for the next six months 
said lt col jim scott district engineer for the army corps of 
engineers which is coordinating the effort 
no one knows how much debris may be strewn along streets and 
highways but riley said 1000 truck loads a day are moved out of 
charleston alone 
about 250 engineers and soldiers from fort stewart ga arrived 
monday equipped with 13 frontend loaders and 40 dump trucks for a 
weeklong assignment they were scheduled to hit the streets of 
charleston berkeley and dorchester counties tuesday to begin work 
the corps of engineers will arrange with private contractors to 
complete the cleanup 
last week the same troops cleared roads in rural areas and 
helped build sand dunes to protect erosionscarred beaches along a 
60mile stretch of the coast known as the grand strand 
these kids have been on a tour of the state nonstop said 
army spokesman capt mike wilbur 
across south carolina 24 counties and 18 million people were 
affected when hugo rolled through the state sept 21 killing 18 
and causing an estimated 4 billion to 5 billion in damage in 
north carolina hugo killed seven people and caused an estimated 
725 million in damage 
brown leaves broken limbs and logs from felled trees still line 
streets and boulevards throughout the region known as the 
lowcountry in places branches are piled so high they block the 
view of houses from the street 
in lowlying areas and on the coastal barrier islands flooded by 
the storm damaged refrigerators washing machines and clothes 
dryers litter the landscape in charleston lumber and sections of 
metal roofing clutter sidewalks 
the federal government agreed last week to pay for removing the 
debris saving state and local governments as much as 50 million 
our goal is that we would want to have and expect everything 
to be picked up within two weeks before cooler dry weather 
turns the debris into a fire hazard the mayor said 
in the inland counties of sumter lee and clarendon landfills 
near capacity before the storm are overflowing with garbage and 
debris fallen trees and food that spoiled during widespread power 
outages 
the county landfill had a thimbleful of space to begin 
with lee county administrator barry hickman said were in big 
trouble now 
tons of debris also caused problems in north carolina its 
just everywhere said al sharp county manager of lincoln county 
nc northwest of charlotte 
meanwhile 6048 federally supported storm cleanup jobs are 
still available said paul hall the disaster coordinating officer 
for the federal emergency management agency 
some 270000 people lost jobs because of the storm but very 
few people have shown an interest in accepting those jobs hall 
said he said the positions pay more than the minimum wage but he 
did not know how much 
sam pike director of the state employment and security 
commissions charleston office said he believed hurricane victims 
are still more concerned with securing electricity food and 
housing than with temporary jobs 
the american red cross announced that only two emergency 
shelters housing 199 people remained in operation in south 
carolina at one point 453 shelters housed 87230 people in north 
carolina south carolina georgia and tennessee

premier michel rocard opened an international 
conference about antarctica on monday by urging that the continent 
be preserved as a wilderness and site of scientific research 
the proposal joined france with many environmental groups 
opposed to the view of the united states which seeks controlled 
use of the remote continents vast mineral resources 
the antarctic is at the heart of the debate on the 
environment rocard told delegates from 39 nations which signed 
the 1959 antarctic treaty 
delegates to the 10day paris meeting will review the treaty 
which preserved the vast icy continent as a place for peaceful 
scientific cooperation 
representatives of the world wide fund for nature and the 
antarctic and southern oceans coalition an umbrella group of 200 
environmental groups said monday negotiations should be held on 
establishing the first world park or international wilderness 
reserve on the continents 55 million square miles 
rocard and bob hawke prime minister of australia announced in 
august they would sponsor a proposal to designate antarctica a 
protected international wilderness park such a reserve would 
permanently ban mineral exploitation and control all forms of human 
activity on the continent which is twice the size of australia and 
almost entirely encased in ice 
the french premier said the proposal is rooted in a fundamental 
belief in the right of future generations to inherit from us a 
planet that is still fit to live in it has gained support from 
belgium italy india and other countries 
leading the other side are the united states new zealand japan 
and chile which back the wellington convention a 1988 accord that 
is six nations short of the required unanimous approval of the 39 
antarctic treaty members it seeks to protect the environment by 
allowing mineral exploitation under strict controls 
its supporters argue that a legal framework regulating mining is 
better than the voluntary moratorium that has existed until now 
the minerals accord also establishes environmental principles 
which are very important said tucker scully head of the us 
delegation in an interview before the conference 
however rocard told delegates that antarcticas purity is 
such that it is an irreplaceable site for observing the ozone layer 
and the changes taking place in the atmosphere 
in august a new zealand team reported the ozone hole over 
antarctica was much larger than previously believed their work 
raised questions about whether the worlds protective ozone layer 
was disintegrating more rapidly than believed earlier exposing 
human beings to dangerous radiation 
rocard called on delegates to hold a special meeting next year 
to work on a comprehensive program for protecting antarctica 
which in my view should take the form of a nature reserve 
at a news conference after rocards speech jacques cousteau 
the french underwater explorer said president francois mitterrand 
had asked him to help develop the french position on antarctica 
cousteau who has collected more than 1 million signatures on a 
petition to declare antarctica a world park said the united states 
was wasting its time defending a lost cause in arguing for 
mineral exploitation 
earlier in the day at paris studios of the american network 
nbc cousteau refused to yield his seat to scully preventing the 
us delegate from presenting the american view on the today 
show 
during their meetings the delegates will discuss controlling 
hazardous waste extending areas designated for special protection 
and developing a plan for dealing with oil spills

following is the englishlanguage text of the account on monday 
by the official soviet news agency tass distributed in new york 
of what tass reported was an alien landing in the soviet union it 
bore the following headline 
confirmed ufo landing in voronezh witnesses frightened 
voronezh scientists have confirmed that an unidentified flying 
object recently landed in a park in the russian city of voronezh 
they have also identified the landing site and found traces of 
aliens who made a short promenade about the park 
aliens visited the place after dark at least three times 
locals report 
a large shining ball or disk was seen hovering above the park 
it then landed a hatch opened and one two or three creatures 
similar to humans and a small robot came out 
the aliens were three or even four meters tall just under 10 
feet to slightly more than 13 feet high but with very small 
heads witnesses say 
they walked near the ball or disc and then disappeared inside 
onlookers were overwhelmed with a fear which lasted for several 
days 
we identified the landing site by means of biolocation 
genrikh silanov head of the voronezh geophysical laboratory said 
in an interview 
we detected a circle 20 meters in diameter four 
4to5centimeter deep dents each with a diameter of 14 to 16 
centimeters were clearly visible they are situated in the four 
points of a rhomb we found two mysterious pieces of rock 
a centimeter is 04 inches and one meter equals 33 feet 
at first glance they looked like sandstone of a deepred 
color however mineralogical analysis has shown that the substance 
cannot be found on earth however additional tests are needed to 
reach a more definite conclusion 
silanov used biolocation to trace the earthly trails of the 
aliens 
witnesses were not informed about the experiment but the route 
along which the aliens walked as described by the onlookers and the 
one established scientifically coincided 
many also claim to have seen a bananashaped object in the sky 
and a characteristic illuminated sign as described in the us 
saga magazine 
it is unlikely that residents of voronezh could have read the 
magazine

namibian police withhold information and 
deny un officials the right to visit people in detention 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said monday in a report 
to the security council 
he also said the southwest african police force known as 
swapol was delaying investigations 
in many cases they have proceeded very slowly and there is a 
risk that some of them including some serious cases of homicide 
will not be completed within the transition period with the result 
that important and crucial evidence may thus be lost he said 
about 1000 un police monitors are in namibia and 500 more are 
being sent to supervise swapol trained by south africa during a 
oneyear period in which the territory is to gain independence 
the foreign ministers of burundi uganda and mali spoke out 
against south africa on monday the beginning of the third week of 
general assembly debate 
foreign minister cyprien mbonimpa of burundi said free elections 
scheduled for november in namibia give hope the general assembly 
can welcome it as an independent nation next year namibians are to 
choose an assembly to write a constitution and organize the first 
independent government in the territory of 13 million people 
paul kawanga ssemogerere of uganda said elements of the namibian 
police and other south african agents threaten the southwest 
africa peoples organization the namibian nationalist party known 
as swapo 
anton lubowski swapos legal advisor was assassinated outside 
his windhoek residence in september and an irishman who entered the 
territory from south africa has been detained 
ngolo traore foreign minister of mali said lubowskis death 
was the result of sordid plots by south african racists 
perez de cuellars report said there was no arrangement for un 
monitors to visit detainees at police stations and monitors were 
not allowed to attend interrogations of swapol members accused of 
offenses 
on occasion swapol has failed to inform un monitors of 
its schedule of patrols making it difficult for supervisors from 
the un transition assistance group untag to accompany them the 
report said 
the secretarygeneral added nor has swapol always shared with 
untag information relevant to the security situation in namibia 
though it has often made unsubstantiated allegations of imminent 
infiltration by swapo combatants from southern angola 
swapo a guerrilla group as well as a political party has 
fought south african occupation of namibia since 1966 
more than 1000 swapo fighters crossed into northern namibia 
from angola on april 1 prompting days of skirmishes with namibian 
police and south african troops hundreds of guerrillas and dozens 
of soldiers and police were reported killed 
on two occasions since south africa has raised false alarms of 
impending swapo invasions 
it is clearly important that security information should be 
shared with untag in order to prevent any recurrence of disturbing 
terrorist incidents which have taken place in recent weeks 
including a murderous attack on untag locations at outjo on aug 10 
and the assassination of a leading official of swapo in windhoek 
lubowski on sept 12 perez de cuellar reported 
he said he had increased the number of police monitors from 500 
to 1500 since april in order to deal with complaints received 
from namibians who do not wish to address themselves directly to 
the police

president augusto pinochet reduced the 
number of army generals by five monday two months before elections 
for a civilian government to replace his military regime 
he retired 12 generals including deputy army commander jorge 
zincke and promoted seven officers to general rank chosen to 
replace zincke was gen jorge lucar figueroa now barracks 
commander for santiago the capital 
gen pinochets changes were part of an annual restructuring of 
the army leadership 
since losing a referendum oct 5 1988 on extending his rule to 
1997 pinochet has reduced the number of generals from 56 to 43 
pinochet has been army commander since shortly before the uprising 
in september 1973 that ousted president salvador allende an avowed 
marxist who died in the coup 
the referendum defeat obliged pinochet to schedule the december 
elections for a civilian government to be inaugurated march 11 
reduction in the number of top officers appears designed to help 
ease the militarys departure from major government posts and its 
return to the barracks 
pinochet 73 has said he will remain as army commander under 
the new government the 1980 constitution written by his 
administration allows him and the navy air force and national 
police commanders to keep their jobs until 1998

a 9yearold accidentally shot and fatally 
wounded a playmate in what could be the first case involving a new 
law making adults responsible for letting loaded guns fall into the 
hands of children 
scott carlton 12 of nearby san mateo was shot in the abdomen 
sunday police said 
the boys had been playing in the 9yearolds bedroom when the 
younger boy took a 22caliber rifle down from a gun rack to show

the adult could be charged with a felony punishable by up to five 
years in prison and a 5000 fine a gun owner faces a misdemeanor 
and up to 60 days in jail and a 500 fine if a minor threatens 
someone with a gun or displays it in public

the flight engineer on delta flight 1141 which 
crashed on takeoff and killed 14 people in 1988 says he did his 
job right and the national transportation safety board agrees but 
he cant find work 
delta fired steven judd and the former navy pilot says he hasnt 
been able to get a job with another airline since the crash at 
dallasfort worth international airport 
i feel that i do need to say something that i did my job that 
day judd 32 said in interviews published monday 
judd was the only member of the planes threeman flight crew 
found blameless by the ntsb when it ruled on the accidents cause 
last month 
the board found that inadequate cockpit discipline by capt 
larry davis and first officer c wilson kirkland resulted in them 
failing to properly set the wing flaps before takeoff 
the board also blamed a faulty takeoffwarning system that would 
have alerted the crew to the misaligned flaps which produce added 
lift during takeoff and landing 
a cockpit recording showed the crew and a flight attendant had 
talked about nonbusiness matters during the 30 minutes before 
takeoff but judd played a small role in the chatter mainly 
sticking to his duties 
the way the media basically said the crew did this the crew 
said that the crew joked about this the crew forgot this it 
hurt judd said when i felt all along that i had done my job 
in july delta fired all three members of the flight crew and 
stands by the decision despite the ntsb finding the crew intends 
to appeal a process that could take several years 
judd has applied for jobs at other major airlines but none 
called him back he said 
im pretty confident that if im not reinstated by delta my 
airline career is ruined judd said 
shortly after the accident judds commander at the dallas naval 
air station in grand prairie said he could come back any time judd 
said three months later he accepted he flies on a reserve status 
about 40 hours per week shuttling cargo or passengers

four east german refugees were sent home 
after they entered poland a prosolidarity newspaper said monday 
an interior ministry spokesman said he could not confirm the report 
the number of refugees registered with the west german embassy 
in warsaw reached about 500 on monday the official news agency pap 
reported 
if the report on the deportations was true it would seem to 
violate assurances reportedly given west germany by the 
noncommunist foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski that no 
east german on polish territory would be sent home against his will 
henryk wozniakowski deputy government spokesman said it 
appeared such incidents had occurred he said the matter was being 
brought to the attention of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
wozniakowski said returning refugees to east germany could be 
justified on purely legal grounds but he expected mazowiecki would 
take a human rights approach 
gazeta wyborcza the prosolidarity paper said the four east 
germans were asked for their documents at szczecin in northwestern 
poland and were sent back when they could not produce the exit 
permits issued by east german authorities to legal travelers to 
poland 
interior ministry spokesman andrzej sadlinski said monday that 
as far as he knew border troops returned to east germany only 
those people apprehended in the border zone while still trying to 
enter poland 
asked about the gazeta wyborcza report he said i personally 
have not heard of such incidents 
solidarity parliamentary leader bronislaw geremek asked if 
poland should give a right of asylum to all east germans fleeing 
their country said the same values and freedoms we fight for 
should be present in polish foreign policy 
geremek said he supported the previously employed solution to 
the question of refugees in poland two east german trains carrying 
more than 1400 refugees were allowed to leave poland last week for 
west germany 
human rights and international conventions governing free 
movement of refugees should be the first consideration geremek 
said 
since the last train left thursday night up to 400 new refugees 
have reached the west german embassy in poland including about 40 
new arrivals monday 
roman catholic church groups charitable organizations and the 
polish red cross are helping care for the refugees pap reported 
by providing accomodation food and clothers if needed we 
are granting strictly humanitarian aid the red cross general 
secretary izabela gutfeter told the agency she said it was 
cooperating with the west german red cross 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said friday that 
407 east germans trying to enter poland illegally were turned back 
at the border by polish border guards 
unlike czechoslovakia poland has not demanded that the east 
germans in warsaw remain on west german embassy grounds it even 
has helped shelter them in vacation hotels on the outskirts of 
warsaw

departments bias incident investigating squad the people who 
could assist us are not available

and early 20s 
the attack in the heavily jewish midwood section was the most 
vicious of the 107 antisemitic incidents reported in the city so 
far this year said sanderson 
what youre talking about is two teenagers one of whom had 
his skull fractured the other of whom has a broken leg these are 
certainly serious injuries sanderson said the third student

israeli soldiers opened fire monday on masked 
arabs who were marching with outlawed palestinian flags in the west 
bank town of nablus killing one of them 
it was the second fatal shooting in as many days in nablus the 
west banks largest town and occurred during an army curfew 
imposed on the 120000 residents 
earlier monday three soldiers were injured when an assailant 
hurled a firebomb at their patrol in nablus the army said one 
soldier suffered moderate wounds and two sustained minor injuries 
the army said 
also monday a 5yearold palestinian girl ulfat nassar was 
shot in the head when israeli troops clashed with stonethrowing 
arab demonstrators in the tulkarem refugee camp northwest of nablus 
doctors at rafidya hospital in nablus said she was in 
extremely critical condition 
in an interview broadcast sunday by israel television lt gen 
dan shomron the army chief of staff said the army could not end 
the 22monthold palestinian uprising by itself 
no doubt that this type of popular uprising no matter where 
it occurs happens from motivation that is impossible to end in one 
action he said it is a long process there is no such thing 
as a military solution 
the violence came as jews marked yom kippur the day of 
atonement with fasting and prayers the holiday judaisms 
holiest ended at sundown 
shops and businesses were closed in arab east jerusalem and in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip to mark the start of the 23rd 
month of the palestinian uprising against israeli occupation 
the general strike was to continue tuesday the fourth and final 
day of a series of closures called by the underground leadership of 
the uprising in sympathy with residents of the town of beit sahour 
israeli soldiers and tax collectors have raided shops and homes 
in beit sahour near bethlehem for more than two weeks because of 
an arab boycott of taxes residents say more than 750000 worth of 
furniture and machinery has been confiscated 
in nablus about a dozen palestinian men were marching near the 
najar university campus when an army patrol spotted them and gave 
chase the army said 
witnesses said when the demonstrators failed to stop the 
soldiers opened fire killing one of the palestinians the army 
identified the victim as nidal elhabash 22 
earlier the army spokesmans office earlier confirmed soldiers 
shot and killed a masked palestinian on sunday who was among a 
group demonstrating in the nablus central market 
the spokesman who cannot be identified by name under military 
rules said some of the palestinians were armed with swords or 
knives he said troops opened fire when the palestinians failed to 
respond to shouts and warning shots 
arab reports identified man killed sunday as ghassan hudhud 32 
the latest deaths raised to 587 the number of palestinians 
killed since arabs launched their uprising in december 1987 against 
israeli rule in the territories another 127 palestinians have been 
killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with 
israel forty israelis have died 
nablus residents said that after the sunday shooting israeli 
troops fired teargas to quell disturbances 
there were reports that a 75yearold palestinian man ahmad 
serwan died after a tear gas shell landed outside his home 
dr asem abu shamma a volunteer with the red crescent in 
nablus said serwan suffered from asthma and that the death 
appeared to be the result of tear gas inhalation 
the army spokesmans office said it had no reports of tear gas 
being fired by the army but was checking 
in the gaza strip on monday six palestinian were shot and 
wounded by israeli troops in scattered stonethrowing clashes 
hospitals reported the army had no casualty reports from gaza 
because of the holiday

solidaritys shipyard workers have built

can call their own 
the state polish shipping co announced monday it plans to name 
a ship under construction solidarnosc in honor of the formerly 
banned trade union led by lech walesa that won legal status again 
this year the state pap news agency said 
the ship is scheduled to be completed by december 1991 said the 
shipping monopoly based in szczecin 
the proposal for the name came from solidarity members at the 
shipping company pap said 
union members first applied to name a ship solidarnosc in 
december 1980 but due to developments in december 1981 the idea 
did not come off said pap in reference to the imposition of 
martial law and subsequent ban on solidarity 
solidarity was legalized again in april and polands new prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki is a solidarity activist

gov bob martinez refused to concede 
defeat monday on the eve of the nations first legislative action 
on abortion since a us supreme court decision despite 
predictions that nothing will be done 
i do believe that the debate has already caused victory in my 
mind in the sense that were now looking at it the fetus as part 
of the human race martinez told reporters as a few antiabortion 
pickets walked outside the capitol 
the governor called a special session beginning tuesday to 
consider restrictions on abortions as a result of the us supreme 
courts july 3 ruling upholding missouri state restrictions on 
abortions 
thousands of activists on both sides of the issue flocked to the 
city for the session and security was tight monday 
martinezs proposals include requiring viability tests if women 
20 weeks pregnant seek abortions banning the use of public 
recources for abortions expanding the regulations abortion clinics 
must abide by and requiring physicians to tell women seeking 
abortions about the development of their fetuses 
legislative leaders have said all summer that theres little 
chance of any of the governors objectives making it through 
committees and the antiabortion movement suffered a defeat last 
week when the state supreme court struck down a 1988 parental 
consent law ruling it violated a privacy clause in the state 
constitution 
the heads of key committees have said new abortion regulations 
would not make it to the floor

a local charitable organization 
canceled plans monday to hold a medieval festival after 
fundamentalist christians protested the evil implications of 
the friday the 13th event 
for the greater good we thought we would just accommodate 
them said william doyle an organization volunteer for the 
saratoga springs chapter of the american cancer society 
the festival originally intended to feature tarot card and 
astrology readings was changed to a general costume ball 
its crazy said psychic ann fisher the fairs honorary 
chairwoman its a misinterpretation of the period of history 
were just trying to do something good its a fundraiser 
but protesters said they found more than the date and its 
featured events ominous claiming mystic references in fliers 
advertising the festival 
tarot card readings or fortunetelling or things like that 
would bring in spiritual forces that are very dangerous said 
rev eric walton pastor of the clifton park center baptist church 
about 20 miles north of albany 
members of the church also protested such things as life 
magazines cover featuring a woman wearing a bra 
doyle said some protesters also objected to the word medieval 
believing its ending sounded evil 
the idea of the fair was objectionable not just the scheduled 
events said paul lincoln chairman of the board of maranatha 
baptist church in nearby ballston spa 
it sure would because of the evil spirits youre getting 
into the spirit realm and the devil he said were certainly 
against it 
doyle said he was not sure why the protesters had singled out 
fridays function since similar events held in the area had not 
been targeted in the past 
pat brown organizer of the medieval faire at the cathedral of 
all saints in albany also set for friday said her organization 
had heard no protests

former premier andreas papandreou failed 
monday to persuade other leftist forces to join his socialist camp 
in a coalition government 
the collapse of that effort means greeks face new general 
elections in november only five months after the last voting 
papandreou told president christos sartzetakis on monday he had 
failed in his threeday presidential mandate for form a new 
government 
emerging from the presidential palace in athens the 70yearold 
papandreou told reporters he outlined proposals of his panhellenic 
socialist movement in a memorandum to the president however he 
did not elaborate 
later in the day communist party chief harilaos florakis was 
summoned to the presidential palace but he declined to try to put 
together a government 
the political crisis stems from the elections june 18 when no 
party won a majority in parliament conservatives and leftists 
banded together in an unusual alliance to press forward legal 
action against socialist officials accused of corruption including 
papandreou himself 
however the alliance said it would govern only temporarily and 
its government stepped down after three months conservative new 
democracy party leader constantine mitsotakis has agreed to remain 
caretaker until a new government is formed 
he too has rejected a presidential mandate to try to form a 
government saying he wanted to quickly clear any obstacles to 
elections on nov 5 
parliament has accused papandreou of corruption in connection 
with a 210 million embezzlement scandal at the bank of crete and 
with purported wiretapping of political friends and enemies 
lawmakers last month sent papandreous case to special courts 
they are scheduled to convene within 60 days to try him along with 
several exministers 
if found guilty papandreou could receive up to 20 years in 
prison

it was a close encounter of the communist kind 
towering tinyheaded humanoids from outer space landed their 
ufo in the russian city of voronezh and emerged for a promenade 
around the park spreading fear among residents 
at least thats what the official tass news agency said monday 
tass contributing to a string of weird tales that have crept 
into the formerly stuffy statecontrolled media in recent months 
said in a straightfaced report that soviet scientists vouched for 
the ufos landing 
scientists have confirmed that an unidentified flying object 
recently landed in a park in the russian city of voronezh tass 
said they have also identified the landing site and found traces 
of aliens who made a short promenade about the park 
a tass duty officer contacted monday evening by telephone 
refused to identify the reporter who sent the dispatch from 
voronezh but stood by the story it is not april fools today 
he said 
the soviet media unleashed by the kremlins policy of glasnost 
greater openness feel free now to hype incredible stories that 
seem more at home in the supermarket tabloids of the west recent 
examples include other accounts of ufos sightings of abominable 
snowmantype creatures and a tale about a young mystic who goes 
into a trance and flies about the cosmos a rash of mystics and 
espartists also have invaded state tv 
in buffalo ny paul kurtz chairman of the committee for the 
scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal commented 
were extremely skeptical of this claim its not the first one 
in the soviet media theres many there seems to be a rash of 
reports largely uncorroborated 
according to mondays tass report a large shining ball or disk 
was seen hovering over the park by voronezh residents they saw the 
ufo land and up to three creatures similar to humans emerge 
accompanied by a small robot tass said 
the aliens were three or even four meters tall almost 10 feet 
to 13 feet but with very small heads the news agency quoted 
witnesses as saying they walked near the ball or disc and then 
disappeared inside 
the report resembled a story last summer in the daily newspaper 
socialist industry which carried an alleged close encounter 
between a milkmaid and an alien in central russias perm region 
in that report milkmaid lyubov medvedev was quoted as saying 
she encountered an alien creature resembling a man but taller 
than average with short legs the creature she said had only 
a small knob instead of a head 
stanton friedman a consultant who lectures on the topic 
flying saucers are real and has examined soviet studies of 
ufos said in secaucus nj on monday that soviet scientists 
tended to treat the subject more seriously than american 
scientists last june the soviet publication soviet military 
review included an article on ufos and security 
the tass report which did not give the date of the purported 
landing in voronezh said onlookers were overwhelmed with a 
fear that lasted for several days 
genrikh silanov head of the voronezh geophysical laboratory 
told tass that scientists investigating the ufo report found a 
20yard depression with four deep dents as well as two pieces of 
unidentified rocks 
at first glance they looked like sandstone of a deepred 
color however mineralogical analysis has shown that the substance 
cannot be found on earth tass quoted silanov as saying 
however additional tests are needed to reach a more definite 
conclusion he said 
silanov said the landing site and path taken by the aliens was 
confirmed using the biolocation method of tracking the agency 
did not explain what that was 
further confirmation came from witnesses in voronezh 300 miles 
southeast of moscow who were not told of the experiments and whose 
accounts coincided precisely with the scientific findings tass 
said 
in july tass deflated a report in socialist industry quoting a 
ufo specialist a kuzovkin as saying a 26footwide patch of 
burned ground near southern moscow was probably caused by the 
landing of a ufo 
not so tass reported firefighters think a haystack simply 
caught fire and scorched the ground 
russians have long been fascinated by the weird and the occult 
but formerly they could glean their information only from rumors 
and underground copies of everything from palmistry guides to books 
on eastern mysticism 
the kremlins economic reforms with their emphasis on each 
enterprise paying its own way have also given the official press 
more incentive to cater to readers tastes in order to increase 
circulation 
kurtzs committee has a ufo subcommittee and has been 
investigating the claim made by tass 
kurtz a professor of philosophy at the state university of new 
york at buffalo said monday 
since the press freedoms in the last year increasingly it 
seems to be open season paranormal pandemonium has broken out in 
the soviet union not only with ufos but faith healers 
astrologers and so on in a closed society such as the soviet 
union you dont get the development of critical reason 
he said the account has all the characteristics of science 
fiction 
kurtz noted that scientist silanov says the landing was 
confirmed by biolocation as far as we can tell its a kind of 
dowsing were very questioning of that its hardly a scientific 
method of testing whether anythings landed or not 
if this were true kurtz remarked i think chairman 
mikhail gorbachev would call a press conference and proudly 
announce that with everybody attempting to get out of the soviet 
union at long last here are some extraterrestrials in that union

chants of we want the as rang out in 
pat osheas madhatter bar monday as elated patrons roared with 
their fists in the air and hugged strangers after the giants 
clinched a spot in the world series a bay bridge series 
excitement was equally intense among oakland as fans on the 
opposite side of the bay who are anxious for their favorite team to 
tackle the men in orange and black 
everyone was hollering bring em on were ready said 
jerry figone owner of the golden bear bar on oaklands lake 
merritt where athletics fans massed to watch the giants victory 
over the chicago cubs on bigscreen tvs a day after the as beat 
the toronto blue jays 
we really want to play em to decide once and for all whos 
best he said 
everybody took a fourhour lunch from 11 am on we were just 
packed said bobby ricardo whose family owns rickys a popular 
joint filled with giant screen tvs and dozens of smaller monitors 
everybody is just amazed that the dream came true that its 
the as and giants he said its a once in a lifetime thing 
were all as happy as we could be no ones going to lose weve 
already won with the bay bridge series 
he said as fans had been rooting for the giants and vice versa 
all weekend 
the last time a world series was played in one metropolitan area 
was 1956 when the new york yankees beat the brooklyn dodgers in 
seven games 
as soon as the game at candlestick ended san francisco police 
reported crowds pouring into north beach where columbus day 
celebrations were under way in the predominantly italian 
neighborhood nighttime revelry along north beachs broadway is 
traditional after a major victory for a san francisco sports team 
at osheas on geary street about 150 young people were 
ecstatic about the bay bridge series 
if you asked me in my wildest dreams if there would be a bay 
bridge world series id tell you youre nuts said dave stein 
of los gatos who said he has attended giants games for a decade 
at the ballpark fan gary stevenson shouted fantastic 
incredible 
despite the jubilation there was no concensus about the outcome 
hearts going to win the series and the giants have a lot of 
heart said john hayward of san francisco at pat osheas 
the as in five retorted another fan who added the as 
have the pitching the as have ricky henderson and the as have 
the power 
kelly pratt bartender at brew pub on the green in fremont said 
the rivalry between as and giants fans is going to be hard 
maybe impossible to contain maybe even a little dangerous 
everybodys getting pretty rowdy 
the bars patrons generally are evenly divided on the teams 
because of its location 20 miles to oakland and an equal distance 
to the south bay a tranditional stronghold of giants fans he 
expects the bar to cordon off areas for each team to keep the fans 
separate 
osheas patrons included at least one lonely cubs fan bill 
hurstik a former chicagoan now living in grand junction colo he 
stood by quietly as the giants partisans whooped it up 
theres always next year well get another pitcher from 
somewhere

the foreign office on monday rejected a chinese 
officials accusation that britain is conniving with activists in 
hong kong to overthrow chinas government 
the chinese armys attacks on prodemocracy students in june 
which left hundreds dead are the cause of the loss of confidence 
in hong kong said a foreign office spokesman 
the british colony is scheduled to revert to chinese rule in 
1997 
as for the view that we have connived at acts of sabotage in 
an attempt to overthrow the chinese government that is quite 
wrong said the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
the people of hong kong attach great importance to democratic 
freedoms under their own legal system he said equally it is 
important that such freedoms are used with a sense of 
responsibility 
there is no evidence that hong kong is used as a base for 
activities against the chinese government the democratic freedoms 
of hong kong must be preserved 
ke zaishuo who heads chinas delegation to a chinesebritish 
liaison committee on hong kong on sunday accused britain of 
adopting an attitude of connivance toward alleged efforts in 
hong kong to overthrow the communist government he did not 
elaborate on the charge

had unshirkable responsibility for widespread fears in hong 
kong about the chinese takeover that have triggered mass efforts to 
emigrate

army attack in beijing and several groups have been formed to work 
for democratic change in china china has called the groups

the stench of rotting rats drove a 
group of public defenders from their office trailer in february and 
theyre still homeless because no one will rent them space 
the attorneys say landlords near south orange county municipal 
court dont want them as tenants because they dont want a steady 
stream of criminal defendants in their buildings 
most of the people seem to have the idea that with us come the 
riffraff of orange county thats just not the case said bob 
goss the senior deputy public defender who shut down the old 
offices because of the stink 
the courts presiding judge pamela iles said the public 
defenders clientele is by and large not dangerous 
they are indigent and they deserve attorneys just like people 
with money she said 
the defenders represent 350 people a month they have long 
needed more space but the crunch became a crisis when a county 
pest extermination effort left the old trailers walls and floors 
filled with decaying rat remains 
for the time being the defenders work out of a tiny temporary 
trailer and a meeting room at a library down the hill from the 
court files and law books are stored at the courthouse 
at this point the rats are starting to look good said carl 
holmes the countys chief deputy public defender 
the solution appears to be a plan to add a twostory building at 
south court susan novak an analyst for the county administrative 
office will pitch the idea to the county board of supervisors in 
several weeks

colombia was in an uproar monday over 
whether president virgilio barco explored a possible truce with the 
cocaine cartels even as new raids were reported in barcos 
declared war on drug traffickers 
authorities raided five cocaine laboratories along the rosario 
river in southwestern narino state arrested eight people and 
destroyed a ton of coca leaves used to make the drug the national 
radio chain caracol reported citing the commander of the states 
antinarcotics police as its source 
police also reportedly seized weapons as well as coca seeds and 
chemicals used in processing cocaine 
with the presidents credibility at stake in his war on drugs 
former interior minister joaquin vallejo confirmed in published 
reports sunday that he acted as a gobetween in truce negotiations 
between the medellin cartel and barcos government 
the bogota daily la prensa on saturday revealed vallejos role 
in the alleged negotiations and the 76yearold vallejo confirmed 
that role in interviews published sunday by bogota newspapers el 
tiempo and el espectador 
vallejo reportedly said there were never any direct negotiations 
and the subject was approached only through intermediaries 
he was quoted as saying the government did not discourage the 
contacts that started in september 1988 and ended almost a year 
later 
the contact roles were played by a medellin lawyer representing 
the traffickers vallejo as the messenger and barcos general 
secretary german montoya who fielded the messages vallejo was 
quoted as saying 
montoya had said such negotiations would be possible only if the 
united states and other cocaineconsuming countries agreed to 
participate the papers quoted vallejo as saying 
they quoted vallejo as saying the us governments strong 
opposition to any dealings with the drug lords made direct 
negotiations impossible 
since the program of president bush has been to fight drugs 
militarily the colombian government had big problems convincing 
the administration to accept the arrangement vallejo said 
according to el tiempo 
this is going to generate a huge national debate el 
espectador quoted fabio valencia an opposition conservative party 
senator as saying it seems to me that the government continues 
to handle matters with a double morality 
montoya said in a communique saturday night that he had not 
negotiated with traffickers and vehemently denied the la prensa 
account he said his decision to meet with vallejo was a personal 
one and that he told vallejo negotiations with the drug traffickers 
was not possible 
memos and other documents about the purported contacts were 
delivered to la prensa by alvaro leyva a conservative party 
senator 
he was quoted as saying in an interview published sunday in el 
espectador that he wondered if the barco administration tricked 
everyone by negotiating with traffickers while maintaining a 
hardline public stance against them 
barco unleashed a campaign against traffickers aug 19 one day 
after sen luis carlos galan a leading presidential candidate was 
killed ostensibly by hitmen hired by drug traffickers 
barco has said repeatedly since the crackdown began that he will 
never negotiate with the drug lords 
traffickers reacted to the government declaration of war against 
them with a bombing campaign

the entry of a retired agriculture agent from canada gordon

quality seed a lot of luck and good holstein cow manure 
if youre used to agriculture and youre used to growing 
things you can see when youve got something different said 
thomson who retired four years ago from the canadian ministry of 
agriculture

the ruling hungarian communist party 
that earlier changed its name and embraced democratic aspirations 
elected the centrist leader of the old party on monday to head a 
slate of reformers in the new one 
rezsoe nyers president of the hungarian socialist party told 
reporters soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was the first to 
congratulate him 
gorbachev conducts very fast diplomacy a tired but elated 
nyers said they gave me his telegram within two hours of my 
election 
he was named president in closed session after key reformists 
reluctantly shelved some of their reservations about him to avoid a 
possible split 
spokesman emil kimmel told state tv the congress also elected a 
25member national steering committee the new partys executive 
leadership and successor of the communist party politburo 
delegates said reformists imre pozsgay and premier miklos 
nemeth members of the old partys collective leadership were 
among the 25 they were not picked as deputies to nyers however 
in a new indication of resistance to too much radical reformist 
influence 
the new partys statutes provide for two vice presidents but 
nyers told reporters the congress could not agree on choices for 
these positions 
a copy of the steering committee list given to the associated 
press contained names of reformers only including some former 
politburo members such as foreign minister gyula horn 
missing were politburo members considered less enthusiatic about 
reform including party spokesman janos barabas 
politburo member karoly grosz the most conservative of the old 
partys collective leadership also was not elected to the steering 
committee but said beforehand he would not seek a senior post 
the clearly reformist makeup of the executive body was expected 
to gratify some liberals unhappy with the choice of nyers former 
chairman of the communist party 
delegate gyoergy kerekes said nyers won the support of 86 
percent of those present and barabas said from 70 to 80 percent 
voted for the steering committee list 
the congress opened friday and ended early tuesday with the more 
than 1200 delegates approving the following resolutions all 
watereddown versions of what radical reformers wanted 
start of discussions in parliament about the fate of 
partycontrolled assets accrued illegally during its predecessors 
41 years in power 
informal support of the largely volunteer workers militia now 
facing dissolution if it decides to give up its paramilitary 
character and become an emergency aid organization during fires 
floods and other catastrophes 
declaration of oct 23 start of the 1956 antistalinist 
uprising as a day of national reconciliation 
on saturday the congress laid the socialist workers communist 
party to rest and founded the hungarian socialist party in a vote 
without parallel in the soviet bloc that opens the way for 
hungarys first free national elections in 41 years 
founding documents described the new party as having 
eurocommunist and democratic socialist leanings committed to a 
free market economy and a parliamentary democracy 
but in an attempt to compromise the congress rejected radical 
reformers demands that diehard marxists be expressly shut out it 
instead stipulated that all accepting the new partys orientation 
in writing could become members 
the new partys formation was the latest bold reform in hungary 
whose democratic strivings have placed it along with poland in 
the vanguard of change in the soviet bloc 
in the showofhands vote delegates overwhelmingly approved 
strivings for a constitutional state based on a multiparty 
system where the source of power is the will of the people 
expressed in free elections 
the party was described as an organization in the marxist 
spirit totally committed to democracy 
despite this reformist delegates have expressed worry that the 
new party did not differ enough from its predecessor and the 
choice of nyers was expected to heighten anxieties among some 
wanting a clean break with the past 
serious ideological rifts emerged among the three leading 
candidates in the collective leadership prior to the secret vote 
but nemeth said earlier to be siding with pozsgay against 
nyers told reporters as he went into the congress hall for the 
vote that the danger of a split has been averted 
pozsgay also emphasized the will to compromise in an interview 
after the vote for nyers everybody agrees on the basics and one 
thing i can tell you is that the reformers are in the majority 
he said 
nyers repeated after the election that there would be no purge 
the congress on sunday voted to continue party politics at 
factories and work shops 
the conservative marxist unity platform issued a statement 
monday saying the old party remained functional and urging true 
communists not to join the new one

a ruling this year that the shipments violated west german export 
laws 
stocker called the fine large but declined to give a figure

libya build a missile capable of carrying chemical warheads and 
with a range of 300 to 450 miles in a camp about 60 miles from the 
saharan oasis of sabha 
stocker told the associated press the possibility of illegal 
german involvement has been under investigation since last spring

range that would allow him to threaten israel

a federal jury monday convicted a man on 
19 counts for the planting of 13 bombs in nearby salem a plot 
prosecutors said was rooted in his lifelong rivalry with a state 
legislator 
the us district court jury deliberated just over three hours 
before returning the guilty verdicts against john m hubbard iii 
hubbards attorney paul j watts unexpectedly rested his case 
monday afternoon without calling witnesses 
hubbard 32 of salem was charged with 29 counts including 
conspiracy illegal possession of dynamite 14 counts of making 
bombs and 13 counts of attempting to destroy bridges and buildings 
used in interstate commerce no bombs actually exploded 
hubbard began to weep before the jury returned to the courtroom 
and his family members cried as the verdicts were announced 
we love you and still believe in you hubbards mother opal 
kramer told her son as he was led out of the courtroom 
hubbard turned to her and said let the world know 
on his way out of the courthouse hubbard told reporters i 
know im innocent god knows im innocent 
watts said he was not certain whether the case will be appealed 
no sentencing date was set hubbard has been in custody since his 
arrest in may 
jerry conrad 42 one of hubbards coworkers at a salem 
factory was convicted on all 29 counts following a trial last 
month salem in in southcentral indiana about 30 miles northwest 
of louisville 
in closing arguments monday assistant us attorney robert 
stanley powell described hubbard as a guerrilla fighter in his 
own mind 
he wanted the thrill of being able to see the fear and the 
panic on peoples faces about the bombs and the chaos he had 
created in salem said powell 
powell said hubbard was motivated by his lifelong rivalry and 
hatred for state rep frank newkirk jr a democrat from salem he 
resented him for a lifetime of accomplishments that he thought 
frank newkirk jr had that mr hubbard didnt powell said 
but watts contended it was absurd to suggest hubbard would plant 
a bomb within 150 feet of his own house and then return home to his 
wife and children to wait to be blown off the face of the earth 
because he didnt get a part in a school play in high school 
watts said the governments case was based entirely on 
circumstantial evidence much of it provided by purchased 
testimony 
government witnesses included a paid informant who was a 
convicted felon and an inmate who met hubbard when both were at 
the marion county jail 
watts told jurors hubbard had continued to deny involvement in 
the bomb case he characterized any boastful statements hubbard 
made as the meanderings of a drunk thats pretty clear 
the defense attorney described hubbard as a gun nut who loads 
his own ammunition who has weird politics we know he exaggerates 
we know that when hes drunk he lies watts said

the pentagon eventually will replace the 
military editors of the armed services newspaper stars and stripes 
with civilians a defense department spokesman said monday 
the development follows a recommendation made last year in a 
study by general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress that said it found evidence of censorship and improper 
management at the governmentrun daily 
when the current military editors retire it is our intention 
to put civilians in there defense department spokesman pete 
williams said in an interview 
williams who said he couldnt give a specific time for the 
change said the pentagon also was looking into the possible 
financial and editorial consolidation of the newspapers two 
editions 
a pentagon source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
switch was expected to occur within several years 
both the european and pacific editions of stars and stripes 
originally designed to serve as a hometown paper for us forces 
overseas have been plagued in recent years by allegations of 
censorship and employee harassment 
a pentagonappointed ombudsman has been in the pacific for two 
weeks looking into the allegations philip m foisie formerly of 
the washington post was named to the new ombudsman position last 
summer 
the gao assisted by the society of professional journalists 
reported last year that it found evidence of censorship and 
improper management the agency also said the editorinchief 
should be a civilian with solid journalism credentials 
the house armed services committee in the defense authorization 
bill report for fiscal 1990 agreed that the editor should have 
solid journalistic credentials but stopped short of calling for a 
civilian 
the gao investigation was launched last year at the request of 
thensen william proxmire dwis 
the good news is for the thousands of military personnel and 
their dependents overseas because the credibility of one of their 
primary sources of news will be greatly enhanced said paul 
mcmasters national freedom of information chairman for the society 
of professional journalists and deputy editorial director for usa 
today 
they were trying to serve two masters and it was an impossible 
duty mcmasters said about the military editors 
williams said a national accounting firm is at the request of 
the gao and congress studying whether the financial consolidation 
would be beneficial 
we want to do what is best for the paper we take any 
allegations of censorship very seriously said williams the 
assistant secretary of defense for public affairs 
defense department regulations prohibit censorship unless the 
military chain of command determines that the information would 
affect military security or the health and welfare of the troops 
williams said 
censorship is not allowed just because some news is 
embarrassing the rules are very clear 
the allegations of censorship and harassment of employees who 
complained to congress have caught the attention of several 
lawmakers including rep barbara boxer dcalif who last month 
called the problem an intolerable situation 
although frequently referred to as one newspaper the stars and 
stripes is published in separate editions by largely autonomous 
bureaus in west germany and japan 
the papers are staffed by military as well as civilian 
journalists but both papers are led by an officer who holds the 
title commander and editorinchief those officers report to the 
heads of the european and pacific commands

too many students are graduating from college without knowing 
basic landmarks of history and thought lynne v cheney 
chairwoman of the national endowment for the humanities said in 
releasing the poll sunday 
part of the problem is that upon entering college students 
often find few requirements in place and a plethora of

the operator of the rocky flats nuclear arms 
plant knew as early as 1984 that dangerous amounts of radioactive 
plutonium may have accumulated in building air ducts but failed to 
act on the information a former employee said monday 
james stone a utility design engineer at the site from 1980 to 
1986 said he raised the probability of such plutonium deposits 
and the safety hazard they would pose with rockwell international 
corp which operates the plant near denver under an energy 
department contract 
they said we cannot afford to clean it stone said in a 
telephone interview 
stones suspicion of a buildup of plutonium residue in the 
ventilation system at rocky flats was borne out by a team of 
independent investigators who disclosed in a report to the energy 
department last week that such plutonium deposits raised a real 
possibility of an accidental nuclear chain reaction at rocky 
flats

its been three years two no 1 hits and 3 
million albums since simply red entered the american pop music 
scene but lead singer mick red hucknall says the audience here 
still doesnt fully grasp the music of his group 
the band that fills sports arenas elsewhere in the world plays 
the smallish palladium in los angeles and the moderate warfield 
theater in san francisco hucknall blames narrowminded radio 
programming 
radio stations everywhere else in the world are very eclectic 
in their musical choice and taste said the 29yearold 
redhaired singer and songwriter they play a whole mash of 
different types of music in america our music doesnt suit their 
programming 
i stil maintain that the public doesnt get a hold on it 
were perceived as a slowballad band 
simply reds american hits if you dont know me by now and 
holding back the years are showcases for hucknalls stunning 
soulful vocals but they tell only half the story 
the music of the sixman ensemble bears little resemblance to 
most contemporary music simply red tackles everything from jazz to 
soul to pop to reggae and does it extremely well and hucknalls 
voice has been compared to everyone from phoebe snow to neil young 
to david ruffin the band a collection of musicians with 
backgrounds ranging from pub performer to church organist prides 
itself on working under its own set of rules far removed from the 
middle of the road 
its repertoire is filled with funkedup dance songs some with 
a leftwing political twist but hucknall who still lives in 
bluecollar manchester england where he grew up finds pop music 
and politics a natural combination 
im not stupid and the whole world is full of things that are 
important hucknall said in a telephone interview from los 
angeles a few weeks before the band was to play two soldout shows 
in san francisco im trying to reach out to people who dont 
believe everything they read the world doesnt revolve around the 
united states or britain 
if i do write about love i write the way i feel about it 
rather than how the rest of the world and public convention would 
have me feel 
but hucknall whose first gig was singing at a wedding when he 
was 6 is more famous for his vocal range than his political views 
critics have a field day speculating on his soul influences sam 
cooke and james brown are two of the favorite guesses but he 
traces his style to the band burning spear and singer lee parry 
the antithatcherism he said comes from four lean years in 
manchester spent scraping by as a deejay hucknall said he decided 
his poverty was due partly to his career choice and partly to 
government policies 
the road to success wasnt easy for hucknall who started 
assembling the band in 1984 hucknall who lent his wideranging 
vocal talents to a punk band called the frantic elevators for three 
years until 1981 was forced to fire some friends as he put 
together simply red 
simply red as hucknall points out is not simply red 
drummer chris joyce and bassist tony bowers joined on from the band 
durutti column guitarist sylvan richardson was a local jazz player 
from the manchester pubs keyboardist fritz mcintyre learned his 
trade in his fathers church and trumpeter tim kellett was 
clasically trained at a british music academy 
the band is currently in the midst of a world tour that has 
taken them to five continents over six months to promote the new 
album a new flame 
weary of life on the road hucknall plans to return to 
manchester soon and enjoy a home he bought last year 
im taking a year out to do nothing he said i enjoyed it 
for awhile but four years is beginning to be a bit of a drag

among the worlds languages japanese is one of the 
most eager borrowers of foreign words but one arm of the 
bureaucracy is putting on the brakes very gently 
please not konseputo how the japanese pronounce 
concept use kihonteki kangaekata basic idea instead 
and no more masuta puran master plan says the ministry of 
health and welfare lets say kihon keikaku basic plan and 
more japanese people will understand 
but the ministrys list of english words to be avoided in 
official documents is accompanied by a list of acceptable ones 
it wouldnt do in france where the commissariat general de la 
langue francaise battles against the franglais that results 
from unapproved cohabitation with english 
if the commissariat ordered un bulldozer to be pushed aside 
for bouteur the french certainly would never agree with the 
japanese ministrys acceptance of homu herupa for home 
helper people who help the elderly at home the japanese by 
the way would translate the french word bouteur as 
burudoza 
the ministry of health and welfare issued guidelines on foreign 
words this past summer because junichiro koizumi the minister at 
the time felt that many ordinary people would not understand some 
of the foreign words used in the ministrys jargon said masato 
shibata a senior planning officer 
the ministry wants to help people but if they dont 
understand what were saying then they dont get help shibata 
said 
borrowed words are written in the katakana script one of three 
scripts in the complex japanese writing system used like italics 
katakana is an angular script in which each symbol is a syllable a 
roundedlooking script called hiragana also uses a symbol for each 
syllable 
though every japanese word could be written in those two 
scripts there is also kanji or chinesestyle characters one must 
know 2000 or so kanji to be able to read a japanese newspaper 
while the katakana and hiragana scripts have about 50 symbols each 
in contrast to its wildly rich writing system spoken japanese 
has fewer sounds than english and european languages no l no th 
no v a weak f a low number of consonant combinations so foreign 
words often are barely recognizable when adopted into japanese 
needs for instance is one of the words rejected by the 
ministry of health it is written in katakana as either needo 
or neezu suggested alternatives are juyo demand and yobo 
request 
but japanese people have been borrowing foreign words for 
centuries and many are in common use 
shirt is waishatsu actually from white shirt and it 
will be found on the laundry list next to the terebi tv on 
the teiburu table at your hoteru hotel 
not all borrowed words retain their original shape or meaning 
handoru comes from handle but means steering wheel 
rihabiri is a shortened rehabilitation 
japanese people think of such imports as katakana words because 
that is the way theyre written said tatsuo miyajima a department 
head at the national language research institute in the ministry of 
education 
bureaucrats are fond of katakana words but not so much as 
people in advertising sports and hightechnology areas when they 
speak japanese they use english words they know the japanese 
words but its easier to use english words 
miyajima added that many people think foreign words are used too 
much but the proliferation continues especially from american 
english 
he said his institute refrains from taking a position for or 
against borrowed words 
english is another great borrower of foreign words he noted 
and that makes the language more powerful so why shouldnt we 
have foreign words

the bowler hat enduring symbol of the englishman 
is catching the fancy of americans 
although it has been disappearing from londons financial 
district where it once was common exports of bowlers are growing 
particularly to the united states experts say 
theres been a marked increase in the number being sold to 
americans said richard stephenson managing director of the 
picadilly hatters james lock and co 
there is also demand from france where gray bowlers are worn to 
the horse races and from australia and africa 
overall sales are 25 percent higher than in the mid1980s with 
most of the growth coming from foreign sales stephenson said 
we are selling more said derek bedford managing director 
of christy and co britains biggest hat maker 
in britain today however bowlerwearers are viewed by some as 
mildly eccentric 
david green an 89yearold insurance underwriter explained why 
he has worn one for 65 years 
they are smart it used to be when people dressed smartly the 
proper thing to wear was a bowler ive just kept on with it 
bowlers also are good to grow geraniums in he said 
bedford attributes the recent upturn to increased demand for 
bowlers as riding hats and as womens fashion head wear 
we have seen some sort of designer ranges in very strong 
colors with holes cut in them and bells sewed on them bedford 
said you do see some very odd derivatives 
bowlers cost 113 to 139 each and americans are not buying 
them as a gimmick or for souvenirs stephenson said 
the vast majority are buying this with every intention of 
wearing it but bedford said we are really finding in the home 
market things quieter than we would like 
made of rabbit fur hardened with shellac bowlers still are 
handcrafted through 47 steps over the course of eight weeks 
bedford said 
the hats date back to 1850 when william coke a norfolk farmer 
asked james lock to make a hard hat that would protect his 
gamekeepers from overhead branches while they rode their horses 
lock designed a closefitting domed hat and had it made by 
london hatters thomas and william bowler 
according to bowler lore coke tried out the hat by jumping on 
it 
james lock has sold the hard hats ever since calling them cokes 
after the first customer but the bowler brothers also branched out 
on their own and their name stuck 
in the united states the hat became known as a derby because it 
was worn to the kentucky derby horse race 
in 1880s britain it became fashionable to wear a bowler in 
town and it was popular among lawyers brokers and bankers 
its particularly associated with london the pinstriped suit 
the rolled umbrella and the bowler hat stephenson said 
but they also were worn by offduty army officers and by the 
foremen of shipyards and mills in northern england 
they still are part of the uniform worn on parade by the orange 
order of northern ireland protestants 
the duke of windsor sometimes wore a bowler as did charlie 
chaplin winston churchill wore a squarecrowned variation 
during the 1920s and 1930s up to a million bowlers were 
produced annually in factories around stockport and manchester in 
northwest england 
the bowler went into decline after world war ii the spread of 
cars meant people didnt need hats as much to keep warm and dress 
became less formal 
after the war christy bought the failing stockport factories 
which altogether employed 3500 people christy currently has 350 
employees making all kinds of hats including some 50000 bowlers a 
year

when alexander the great founded his capital 
on egypts mediterranean coast he intended it to dominate the 
world it did but not through military force as he imagined 
alexandria dominated through knowledge and culture and at the 
heart of its glory was the greatest library in the history of the 
world 
the library of alexandria lasted for hundreds of years after the 
conquerors death in babylon at age 33 but it disappeared with few 
traces early in the christian era 
now almost 2000 years later egypt is embarking on a project 
to restore alexandrias cultural prominence by creating a new 
library as a symbol of where egypts been and where its going 
we want others to see egypt from the right point of view as a 
country of civilization said ahmed fathy sorour egypts 
minister of education who is heading the project 
we are much more than keepers of the pyramids we are reviving 
the concept of the alexandria library in order to prove to the 
world that egypts civilization didnt go away but is a living 
tradition 
the site is ready and the design chosen for the projected 180 
millioncomplex that officials say will bring new life to an old 
but honored city 
the site is prime mediterranean seafront backed by the bustle 
of alexandrias 4 million people on the horizon is the 
10thcentury fortress of qait bey built where one of the seven 
wonders of the ancient world the pharos lighthouse purportedly 
stood 
the design by the norwegian architectural firm snoehetta is for 
the new alexandria library to be a sweeping circle of concrete 
steel glass and stone a symbol of the sun 
if an international fundraising drive now under way succeeds 
and the project meets its schedule the library complex will be 
completed by 1995 
recapturing ancient glory wont be easy for few cities have a 
more impressive early history than alexandrias 
founded in 331 bc it beckoned the greats of its time who in 
turn gave the world a harvest of their best thoughts and 
inventions the pipe organ the archimedes screw the atlas and 
12month 365day year grammar and geography geometry and 
trigonometry steam and fire engines coinoperated machines city 
planning and cataloging 
from alexandria came news that the earth revolved around the 
sun alexandrian scholars calculated the circumference of the earth 
to within 50 miles and the length of the solar year to within six 
minutes 
poetry and prose abounded they emptied from the 
athensalexandria axis into ports around the world greek becoming 
roman becoming western heritage 
alexandrian culture revolved around an academic complex called 
the moseion a think tank for mediterranean intellectuals with the 
freedom and the means to create at will at the heart of the 
moseion was the library 
both were thriving by 285 bc a halfcentury before 
establishment of a second even greater alexandria library known to 
scholars as the daughter library it eventually contained an 
estimated 500000 volumes a trove so vast 120 parchment scrolls 
were required to catalog it 
the collection included the 200000 volumes of the pergamum 
library carted away from what is now turkey by lovesmitten mark 
antony as a gift for cleopatra 
debate continues over the fate of the ancient alexandria 
libraries some historians contend they were destroyed during 
jewish revolts of ad 115117 others say christians who rioted 
against pagan ways in ad 391 destroyed them 
there appears little evidence the institutions survived long 
enough to be destroyed by arab invaders hundreds of years later as 
many early western scholars wrote 
whatever happened the libraries and records about them were so 
thoroughly demolished that nobody knows for certain what they 
looked like or even where they stood 
the idea to revive the alexandria library was born in 1974 
university of alexandria officials saw it as a way to perpetuate a 
literary and cultural heritage long associated with their city 
still an educational headquarters for more than 80000 students 
they decided the first step would be a new library but by the 
time hosni mubarak egypts president laid the cornerstone june 
26 1988 the library had become an academic and social center it 
was to include a conference center a planetarium a scientists 
hall of fame a calligraphy museum and other facilities 
its unfair for others to look on egypt only as a developing 
country struggling toward its economic development education 
minister sorour said the west owes much to other cultures 
including egypt and later the arabs

feminist groups in traditionally 
roman catholic brazil have launched the countrys first prochoice 
abortion campaign 
though abortion is illegal except when the mothers life is 
endangered due to preganancy or in cases of rape independent 
researchers say 3 million to 5 million clandestine abortions take 
place a year 
that would make brazil the worlds leader accounting for 4 
percent to 7 percent of the world health organizations estimate of 
roughly 65 million abortions that take place each year 
ivany buzzo director of the feminist health collective based 
in sao paulo said brazilian women have been discussing abortion 
for more than 10 years but never lobbied for legalization 
abortion is an extremely delicate issue in brazil 
particularly with the churchs influence said ms buzzo a 
leader of the prochoice drive 
about 85 percent of brazils 145 million people are listed as 
roman catholics 
the prochoice campaign was officially launched at the 10th 
national feminist meeting in midseptember 
the coalition is planning street rallies a media campaign and 
public debates and will lobby congress in support of a bill 
introduced in early september by rep jose genoino of the 
promarxist workers party calling for the legalization of abortion 
during the first three months of pregnancy 
abortion is a human rights and class question ms buzzo 
said everyone knows where the clandestine abortion clinics are 
including the government so for upper and middleclass women its 
essentially legal 
the average cost of an illegal abortion runs from 200 to 850 
but even 200 is far beyond the means of the majority of women 
its pure hypocrisy genoino said brazil is the world 
champion in abortions but the law forces poor women to risk their 
life if they want to terminate their pregnancies 
carmen barroso a sociologist with sao paulos carlos chagas 
research foundation estimated that about 10000 women die each 
year after using crude methods for selfinduced abortions such as 
knitting needles 
his research also indicates that about 200000 women a year are 
admitted to public hospitals due to medical problems stemming from 
selfinduced abortions 
feminist groups also complain that in the case of rape legal 
requirements are so stringent that few brazilian women are able to 
get abortions on those grounds 
rape victims need reports from the police and the governments 
legal medical institute confirming a rape occurred a judge then 
must authorize the abortion 
by the time all the requirements are met the child is already 
in school ms buzzo said 
in addition the legal medical institute wont classify an 
attack as rape unless the victim has physical injuries and if sperm 
is found in the vagina if a woman did not resist brazilian 
law does not consider rape to have taken place 
only 20 percent of the women who go to the institute claiming 
they were raped are able to have the crime classified as such ms 
buzzo claimed 
she said few judges will authorize an abortion even if all 
requirements are met because of personal opposition or fear of 
negative publicity 
in 1987 rio de janeiro became the first city to pass specific 
legislation implementing the legalabortion law and two public 
hospitals were designated to perform abortions on rape victims the 
need for a judges authorization was dropped 
but figures from the rio de janeiro state health department 
showed only two women had legal abortions nearly two years after 
the law went into effect 
few women have the courage to admit they were raped said 
dr sara sorreltino also a member of the feminist health 
collective they dont know about the law or they are unable to 
prove the attack took place 
prochoice supporters dont believe legalization of abortion 
will take place any time soon genoino estimated that only 50 of 
brazils 570 congressmen will support his bill 
but ms buzzo contended a democratic society must grant women 
the right to bear a child or not its going to be a struggle but 
ultimately well win

this is an off year for jesse jackson so his 
impact is limited hes an issue in one current and one coming 
campaign an indirect factor in a couple more and national 
democratic rulemakers have just dealt with a problem he left them 
now hes announced plans to become a television talk show host 
next fall just when a lot of people think he may be campaigning 
for mayor of the district of columbia 
jackson isnt saying yes or no i do not choose to pursue the 
hypothetical he said in announcing his television plans last 
week i am not running for any office and at this point have no 
plans to do so 
jackson said he wants to go on television with the weekly talk 
show to break a pattern in which fewer and fewer people talk 
about more and more and often know less and less 
then too the national forum of a syndicated television program 
would provide exposure and in effect an introduction to voters 
the twotime democratic presidential candidate wouldnt otherwise 
reach and that can only add to the jackson factor in democratic 
politics 
jackson transplanted his rainbow coalition political 
headquarters from chicago to washington this summer saying he 
wanted a base closer to congress and the rest of the federal 
government 
he registered to vote in the district of columbia on aug 3 
thus qualifying to run for mayor but he said he would not run 
against embattled mayor marion s barry jr his longtime ally in 
the civil rights movement barry has said he will seek a fourth 
term there will be at least three other democratic candidates 
that confronts the charismatic black leader with the kind of 
problem that doesnt apply at loftier political levels his 
statements and barrys put things on hold pending further 
maneuvering but there has been no hold in the speculation notably 
after democratic national chairman ronald h brown said he thinks 
jackson will run for mayor and will win brown convention manager 
for the jackson presidential campaign in 1988 said his forecast 
wasnt based on inside information or direct word from jackson 
brown also said he doubted anything short of legal proceedings 
would keep barry from running again barry has been involved in a 
federal investigation into alleged drug dealing by an associate and 
former city employee the mayor has denied any wrongdoing 
when that puzzle unravels it could have a national impact 
should jackson become mayor it could sideline him in what 
otherwise would be an almost certain third campaign for the 
democratic presidential nomination in 1992 
the jackson factor also figures in other more immediate 
political competition notably the contest for mayor of new york 
republicans have tried to make an issue of jacksons support for 
david n dinkins the black democrat who won nomination over mayor 
edward koch despite apologies and peace gestures jacksons 1984 
description of new york as hymietown still rankles among jewish 
voters a vital bloc in a mayoral election there 
jacksons headquarters said he has no firm schedule for campaign 
appearances in new york but he is expected to go there for efforts 
to register and turn out black voters in dinkins behalf 
in virginia where lt gov l douglas wilder seeks to become 
the first black elected governor of any state jackson has stayed 
out of the campaign wilder needs the support of moderate and 
conservative democrats to win with those vital blocs jacksons 
involvement would be counterproductive 
in cleveland voters will be choosing between two black 
candidates for mayor and while jacksons allies backed the man who 
led the primary the challenger is coming on strong after 
unexpectedly beating three white candidates to win a spot on the 
final ballot 
at the democratic national committees fall meeting one 
jacksonsponsored change in the rules on apportionment of 
presidential nominating was undone with another to follow later 
the committee restored the status of its 303 members as uncommitted 
delegates to future conventions later with browns support it 
plans to revive a requirement that candidates in the 1992 primaries 
and caucuses get at least 15 percent of the vote in order to win 
committed delegates jackson advocates straight proportional 
representation

the writer gathered material for this story in 
afghanistan and at an afghan refugee camp in pakistan 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sharifa fled afghanistan to a refugee 
camp here in search of a quiet place away from the rockets bombs 
and bullets she thought would shatter her comfortable life back 
home 
finding such peace has left the 33yearold woman without word 
of her husband in the afghan army and cost her a career and 
ultimately her identity 
now she is forced to hide her face behind a veil in public in 
accordance with the customs of the islamic fundamentalism that 
prevails at the refugee camp 
in kabul the shellshocked afghan capital 400 miles away 
another woman sadiqqa vows never to pay that price 
i would rather die the 19yearold science student at kabul 
university said putting on a veil amounts to being imprisoned or 
kept in a cage nothing could be worse 
president najib of afghanistan has been been playing on those 
fears frequently reminding afghan women of the fundamentalism of 
the moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow his government 
much has happened to change the lives of afghan women since 
civil war broke out 11 years ago said esmatee wardak chairman of 
the all womens council of afghanistan in kabul 
when the men went to war the women started working in 
factories and offices as painters and carpenters in short they 
got their first taste of freedom these are the women who would 
have a difficult time under the fundamentalists said mrs 
wardak one of two women with cabinetrank in najibs government 
the womens rights movement took root in afghanistan in 1919 
the year it declared its independence 
when sharifa was 3 years old in 1959 king zahir shah decreed 
that women no longer had to wear the chadri the tentlike pleated 
garment with a mesh opening over the eyes 
encouraged by her family and particularly her father sharifa 
said she wore western clothes graduated from kabul university and 
went to work as an accountant in a government office 
that changed with the war 
when her husband was drafted into the afghan army nearly four 
years ago sharifa took their small son and daughter across the 
mountains to western pakistan where they have lived in a tworoom 
mud hut furnished with ragged pillows on the floor and decorated 
with pictures from magazines pasted on the walls she said she 
doesnt know if her husband is dead or alive 
in pakistan she and a few others like her were suddenly 
surrounded and alienated by afghan women with traditional ideas 
women with whom they had little contact back home 
envied or ostracized by the others sharifa and those like her 
complain of the narrowness of their lives and of the hard times 
imposed by the mullahs the religious leaders who roam the camp 
searching for wrongdoing 
the slightest infringement is reported to the mullahs and since 
she is dependent on them for food and other necessities her 
children will suffer for her misdemeanors 
sharifa said she is obedient because of her 9yearold son and 
10yearold daughter soon the daughter will be forced to wear a 
veil in public 
right now shes as free as shell ever be in her life 
sharifa said soon she will lose that freedom and have to join 
the other women 
but there is no way out until the war ends 
sometimes i wonder if ill ever return home she said i 
wont go back if the fundamentalists come to power i will not stay 
under this veil and be hounded by the mullahs i want to be happy 
again 
on the kabul university campus with western rock music blaring 
from a portable stereo sadiqqa and her friends discuss the plight 
of women like sharifa who are forced to abandon their ambitions and 
modern lifestyles for what they call gulbuddins medieval 
fortress gulbuddin hekmatyar is a moslem guerrilla leader 
if youre married youre a wife otherwise you are just a 
woman said sadiqqa dressed in tight western blue jeans a blue 
tshirt with sequin appliques and her long black hair pulled back 
in a ponytail 
islam isnt against women working but islams interpretations 
are always done by men thats the problem 
those fears were heightened last year when the guerrilla leaders 
drafted a constitution stating women must be kept in purdah the 
practice of wearing the veiled costume 
although the constitution was later abandoned many leaders in 
the sevenparty guerrilla alliance still say they would not want 
women to vote in an election of a new afghan government 
but the war has made afghan women on both sides of the border 
more assertive and determined 
i am a moslem but i will never ever again wear a chadri 
said mrs wardak one of four women elected to the parliament in 
1964 when afghan women were given the right to vote 
islamic law does not require it and now there are many women 
like me who will fight anyone who tried to put us back under the 
veil we will defend our rights 
mrs wardak was wearing a white suit with pink scarf tied around 
her neck the day she was interviewed in her kabul office 
she said afghan society has become much more dependent on women 
during the decadelong struggle between the government and the 
mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors the war has left onethird of 
the countrys 15 million people dead living in exile or in refugee 
camps along the border 
moslem women in general have a long tradition of fighting for 
their beliefs and their countries dating back to the prophet 
mohammads wife aisha who went to battle beside her husband on a 
camel afghan women have a long history of being on the front 
lines including fighting the british during three wars in the 19th 
century 
today is no exception said mrs wardak who earned a masters 
degree in education at northwestern university in evanston ill 
more than 8000 women have enlisted in the armed forces training 
as pilots and paratroopers and fighting sidebyside with male 
soldiers she said 
men present themselves as intrepid and heroic telling how 
they have suffered by going to war she said women have 
suffered a lot since the revolution they have lost husbands and 
fathers sons and brothers 
women will be essential in rebuilding afghanistan once the 
conflict ends mrs wardak added 
we are a backward country how can a society improve without 
the participation of women especially at this stage of development 
in the world its impossible

at age 75 thor heyerdahl is digging in a 
remote area near the coast of peru for treasures left by a 
civilization be believes is older and more advanced than the 
celebrated incas of the andes 
more than 40 years earlier heyerdahl set sail from the same 
peruvian coast for polynesia on the kontiki the primitive wooden 
raft that first carried him to fame 
heyerdahl is exploring a sprawling complex called the tucume 
pyramids which he believes were built by ancient seafarers who 
reached the new world on fragile rafts like kontiki about the time 
of christ or before 
this is the greatest archeological find of the century 
its the most exciting project of my life a trim heyerdahl said 
in an interview while in norway recently to celebrate his birthday 
at his boyhood home in larvik a southern town of 38000 people 
heyerdahl said he was introduced to the tucume find by the 
peruvian archaeologist walter alva 
work on the 26pyramid complex began last year but an area of 
this size is not studied in one mans lifetime heyerdahl said 
it will take generations 
the find he said may cast doubt on current theories about the 
settlers of ancient america 
the pyramids were made of adobe a material most often used in 
those times in distant mesopotamia the region near what now is 
iraq he said 
he added that he is certain he will find a treasure of gold and 
artifacts when he opens the ancient tombs 
the complex in northwest peru is linked to the sea by a 12mile 
system of canals big enough for rafts like kontiki to sail 
through he said the canals once were filled in but later dredged 
out for irrigation channels 
one of the first utensils we found was a small steering oar 
from a small balsa raft heyerdahl said 
seashells and stones from distant parts of south america found 
there also indicate that the builders of tucume were an ancient 
race of sailors he said 
spanish explorers found the coastal complex in the 1500s but 
they continued into the andes in search of inca treasure and 
tucome was forgotten by the world heyerdahl said 
oral histories of coastal dwellers recorded by the spaniards 
told of fleets of rafts that brought king nymlap at least 2000 
years ago legend has it that his grandson kala started work on 
the pyramids heyerdahl said 
i could only prove that balsa rafts were seaworthy and could 
sail he said of his 101day 4300mile voyage on the kontiki 
in 1947 here we have the final proof that they did sail and they 
did navigate in the open ocean 
heyerdahl set out on kontiki in an attempt to prove his theory 
that prehistoric civilizations reached the americas from across the 
pacific on rafts carried by ocean currents 
he said he and his researchers had not yet determined when the 
people who built tucume arrived in peru but he added that the find 
predates the incas and even the chimo a tribe vanquished by the 
incas about 1100 ad 
by the time we finish excavation we will be able to say when 
it all started he said 
the incas were to south america what the romans were in 
europe they were not the founders of culture they were the 
military power that took over what others had created 
though the origins are obscure heyerdahl said it is clear the 
tucume civilization was wiped out 
there are many lessons in the past and one lesson is that not 
one civilization has been eternal he said

consider the advantages of pedal power 
inexpensive and pollutionfree there are twice as many bicycles as 
there are automobiles yet much of the world is curiously 
ambivalent toward them are they relics of another century or are 
they the wave of the future 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
here they come thousands at a time steering quietly down the 
streets of amsterdam and beijing or a file of humped silhouettes 
etched against the mountainocean sunset of california 
here they come bicycles and their riders caught by the dawns 
early light or the headlights glare pumping legs determined 
faces wheeling to work wheeling home or just determined to stay 
fit 
bicycles there are 800 million in all 88 million in the united 
states 300 million in china a very personal pollutionfree mode 
of transportation 
the question is are they relics of another century or are they 
the wave of the future 
the competition is the automobile 400 million in the world no 
one in his right mind would say its an even fight 
but the worldwatch institute in washington a think tank 
recently published worldwatch paper 90 by marcia d lowe with the 
title the bicycle vehicle for a small planet 
the message is that bicycles consume less energy per passenger 
mile than any other form of transportation including walking a 
cyclist can cover 3 miles on the calories in an ear of corn 10 
miles on the 350 calories in a bowl of rice the average american 
car covers 10 miles on about half a gallon of gasoline or 18600 
calories 
bicyclists do not produce smog or acid rain they do not 
endanger the ozone layer and few cyclists are pulled over for dwi 
they do produce sweat however 
marcia lowe writes that 33 states included bicycle promotion 
measures in their plans to comply with the clean air act of 1970 
los angeles would make major employers reduce the ratio of 
commuting cars to employees other western cities would make 
employers provide bicycle parking and shower facilities 
all of this comes 90 years after the bicycle craze crested in 
america in 1899 with automobiles not yet on the road and public 
transportation in the form of trolleys and electric trains just an 
infant enterprise the united states was selling more than a 
million bicycles a year in a nation of barely 76 million those 
were impressive figures 
so ubiquitous were those safety bikes that they altered 
american fashions knickers kept pants legs out of the way of chain 
drives long norfolk jackets caught the mud and women began to 
wear shorter skirts and heaven forfend bloomers so they could 
ride their bikes whole families would go out for weekend bicycle 
outings 
fred zahradnik of bicycling magazine points out that the bicycle 
was a vehicle for technology as well as people the wright brothers 
were bicycle makers as were hundreds of other tinkerers of the 
late 1800s orville and wilbur experimented with lightweight tubing 
that eventually made their airplane design possible glen curtis 
worked on bicycles and applied motors to them before he 
concentrated on aircraft engine design 
if one looks into the past he may find some hints to the 
bicycles future 
in its heyday the bike was personalized individual 
transportation it didnt have the upkeep of a horse or the 
expense of a carriage zahradnik says if the roads got bad 
you could pick it up and carry it it was one of the fastest 
easiest simplest forms of transportation 
and it built roads it was the complaints of bicyclists in 
washington and state capitals that led to the first modern surge of 
roadbuilding it paved the way for the automobile 
but oddly it wasnt the car that led to the fall of the 
bicycle it was public transportation steampowered locomotives 
and the electric trolley which were felled in turn by the car 
in the late 1800s a good bike cost about 100 which was 
expensive in days when the average income was 8 a week today some 
are as cheap as 100 or as expensive as 3000 the united states 
makes about 5 million bikes a year and imports another 5 million 
americans however remain in love with their cars 
in china where one person in every 74000 owns an automobile 
one in four owns a bike in one study in the northern industrial 
city of tianjin monitors counted 50000 bicycles passing one 
intersection in an hour 
bicycle ownership does not mean bicycle use fortyone million 
american bikes are owned by children 
in britain one out of every four people owns a bike yet only 
one out of every 33 transport trips are made by bike 
writes worldwatch institutes lowe 
the united states has seven times as many bicycles per person 
as india but because one out of every two americans owns an 
automobile compared with one out of 500 indians bicycles play a 
much more modest role in the us transportation system 
the chinese phenomenon began when the last emperor pu yi began 
pedaling around the forbidden city in the early 1900s today 
chinas annual bike sales exceed 40 million 
the rest of the developing world lags far behind in bicycle 
transportation says the worldwatch report in much of africa 
and even more widely in latin america the prestige and power of 
auto ownership has made governments ignore pedal power and led 
citizens to scorn the bicycle as a vehicle for the poor 
oddly the cost of fuel for latin american and african cars 
contributes to their national debt and their trade deficits there 
are exceptions in bogota the capital of colombia the citys 
largest bakery replaced most of its trucks with 900 delivery trikes 
to supply 60000 neighborhood shops

in europe the netherlands and denmark have taken steps to make 
their roads more friendly for cyclists with the result that 
bicycles are used for 20 percent to 30 percent of all urban trips 
and up to half in some towns 
in the netherlands a recent system of taxes increased the cost 
of buying and driving a car by half an electronic system will 
monitor speedometers and excessive drivers will be taxed 
accordingly at the same time public transit is being given an 
extra 57 billion a year 
in denmark officials claim that gasoline prices are the highest 
in europe thanks to aggressive taxing and says the worldwatch 
report the danish ministry of transport describes the 186 
percent sales tax on new cars compared with 47 percent in the 
netherlands and 5 percent in the united states as paying for three 
cars and getting only one 
a british study said that if only 10 percent of car trips of 
less than 10 miles were made by bicycle it would cut the countrys 
fuel consumption by 14 million barrels of oil a year 2 percent of 
annual consumption 
the ironies abound third world governments concentrate on 
building roads for cars in their rural areas despite the fact that 
their rural citizens do not have cars or trucks worldwatch quotes 
transportation expert wilfred owen as saying many miles of roads 
in poor countries prove more useful for drying beans and peppers 
than for moving traffic 
and even though bicycle rickshaws are a transportation mainstay 
in many asian countries and a means of raising the income and 
status of poor people some local governments say they are unsafe 
or inhumane a more likely motive says worldwatch is that the 
quaint rickshaws make cities look poor or backward 
so it comes to pass that in dhaka in bangladesh the government 
threatened to phase out rickshaws even though they employ 140000 
people and account for more than half of the citys passenger miles 
and in jakarta the capital of indonesia some 100000 rickshaws 
have been confiscated in the last five years and dumped into the 
sea 
japan which makes cars for most of the world leans heavily on 
bicycles and commuter railroads when railway terminals began to 
suffer from bicycle pollution the government set aside bike 
parking lots of which there are now 8600 with a capacity of 24 
million bikes in urban downtowns where land prices are over 7000 
a square foot they have built bike parking towers 
in california the university towns of davis and palo alto vie 
for cycling honors davis boasts that a quarter of all trips made 
by its 44000 citizens are made by bike bike trailers are a common 
sight for lugging groceries or children 
palo alto pays its employees 7 cents a mile for all business 
travel by bike it sponsors a city wide leave your car at home 
day has a bicycle squad in its police force and holds a traffic 
school for children who break bicycle laws 
some employers in the city of 56000 have joined the movement 
one offers bike commuters 1 a day for every day they ride to work 
xerox provides free towel service in the shower room 
its been 173 years since the first bike appeared in 1816 a lot 
has changed bikes have evolved from a crude contraption called the 
hobbyhorse which was propelled by the riders feet on the ground 
to the enlarged front wheel that covered more ground for each 
revolution of the riders pedals to chain drives and the safety 
bicycle to todays onepiece lightweight frames 
bicycles gave the world ball bearings and pneumatic tires 
in the late 1800s bicycle racers were some of the highest paid 
athletes in the country garnering winnings of between 20000 to 
40000 a year 
they were like todays superstars says bicyclings fred 
zahradnik they traveled the world to race 
thousands flocked to see the sixday bike races on wooden or 
concrete tracks at the turn of the century there were some 200 
race tracks in the united states alone 
one racer was charles mileaminute murphy on june 30 1899 
he pumped up to 60 mph on a board track making use of the suction 
behind a fast locomotive 
another zahradnik says was major taylor one of the first 
great black athletes to emerge in the united states in the late 
1800s he was often turned down by hotels on his world racing 
circuit 
bike makers have constantly changed designs to appeal to young 
riders with the balloon tire came schwinns streamliner there was 
the donald duck bike by shelby sporting a donald duck hood 
ornament and a quackquack horn there was the huffy radiobike 
which had a radio in the tank on the crossbars in the late 1950s 
there was bowden spacelander and a drag racer called the schwinn 
orangecrate 
but now engineers are setting out to improve designs for 
practical reasons bicycle trailers and three and fourwheel 
designs are increasing the loadcarrying capacity 
the oxtrike designed at oxford university has a platform and 
gears capable of moving heavy cargo in india designers are 
working on a multipurpose bike that can double as a 
nontransportation motor for threshing rice paddies shelling 
peanuts or pumping water 
it may indeed be that the wheels of the past will power the 
future

imagine days of gliding through scenes 
from roman antiquity on a bicycle with midmorning stops for 
cappuccino streamside lunches of freshbaked bread cheese 
prosciutto and wine and evenings in luxurious villas 
thousands of people young and old athlete and couch potato 
are finding travel by bicycle an exhilarating way of really seeing 
the countryside talking to people and finding historic or cultural 
locales rarely available to those speeding through on 
airconditioned tour buses 
many adventurous souls are setting off on bicycle trips on their 
own loading their twowheelers with clothing bedrolls and 
necessities others are letting a tour company make lodging 
arrangements plan an itinerary schedule meals and provide a van 
to haul luggage 
bicycle tours are available through most european countries 
most areas of the united states central and south america and even 
the soviet union and china 
i and my wife chose one of the most experienced biking and 
walking tour operators butterfield and robinson of toronto and 
rode from near milan italy to venice on a bicycle built for two 
a frenchmade 10speed tandem you can ship your own bike or the 
tour operator will provide custommade bicycles 
the american bicycle federation says the number of bicyclers in 
this country increased from 78 million to 88 million since 1985 
it is expected the bicycle craze will spurt again now that 
american greg lemond has won the prestigious tour de france 
several states hold popular crossstate bicycle tours one of 
the most grueling is the ride the rockies tour that this year 
covered 361 miles and went over 11990foot loveland pass tour 
director paul balaguer said 3500 people applied for the tour 
which is limited to 2000 
our northern italy group included 23 americans people from all 
walks of life from all parts of the united states ages ranged from 
about 30 to the 60s tour operators said the eldest to date had 
been a 78yearold man 
some had done nothing more to train for the trip than their 
usual tennis or golf game they also were a little stiff and sore 
the first day or two but that quickly went away my wife and i had 
bicycled about 30 miles on saturdays and sundays for two months 
before the tour and found the tour a breeze 
bicycle helmets and biking gloves are strongly recommended and 
an athletic shoe with a firm sole is a good idea otherwise 
clothing is left up to the individual on the tour attire ranged 
from skintight bicycling outfits to shorts tshirts and slacks a 
lightweight rain jacket is recommended for chilly mornings and 
afternoon showers 
our group gathered in the lobby of a milan hotel and then it was 
off by bus to sirmione on a peninsula on the southern shore of 
lake garda italys largest at the tip a modern hydrofoil 
passenger boat cruised past the ruins of a roman spa 
idling past sidewalk cafes coffee shops and tourists the bus 
squeezed through a narrow passageway at a historic castle then 
deposited our group at the steps of villa cortine the first of 
several luxurious villas where our palates would be pampered at 
multicourse meals and our bodies rested in regal suites 
our two guides jennifer a toronto lawyer and nick whose 
future plans include screenwriting in new york showed us our 
bicycles and gave us an orientation on safety including the 
required wearing of helmets and a caution against braking hard with 
only the front brake it can throw you over the handlebars 
they discussed the daily routine breakfast together and then to 
the bicycles which would be checked and ready the cyclists were 
encouraged to set their own pace and see the sights some raced off 
each morning on optional side trips that saw them travel up to 50 
miles in a day others stopped to take photographs visit with the 
natives enjoy a cappuccino or espresso and purchase postcards 
still completing the average 30 miles a day in time for a swim at 
the villa

detailed instructions for each days route were handed out at 
breakfast with a caveat that directions are subject to personal 
interpretation and one persons bear right at the cross could 
be anothers hard right at the tintersection and said the 
guides remember getting lost is part of the adventure 
a sample instruction read 2 km kilometers from the tower 
turn right at intersection following signs for vaccarolo and san 
pietro not solferino at this intersection the abandoned abbey of 
san firgillo can be seen directly in front of you 
tours are graded by level of difficulty from the northern italy 
level one rolling hills and generally level but with one hill 
where we pushed the tandem to the top to the level four giro 
ditalia described as a challenging route through the hills of 
tuscany and umbria designed for the enthusiastic and 
experienced cyclist 
an example of the magnificent villas chosen for touring 
bicyclers was the villa corner in cavasagra built in 1500 and 
named for a queen caterina cornaro the villa was extensively 
rebuilt in 1700 by a palladian architect 
today it has manicured grounds a vineyard huge pool spa 
tennis courts and suites the size of some american town houses 
after we finished the tour and went sightseeing in venice the room 
at our pensione was the size of the walkin closet in our villa 
corner suite 
the tour stayed on side roads with light traffic even when the 
cyclists pedaled into larger cities such as verona they found 
italian motorists to be considerate thousands of italians pedal to 
school to work or to the market but safety helmets are unknown 
and ours brought many curious glances 
sights along the way included ancient and modern churches 
centuriesold family estates more castles than could be counted 
familyoperated wineries and a wedding celebration 
in verona there was a wine lecture and tasting at the instituto 
enologico italiano a tour of the ancient roman arena and the opera 
house a visit to the balcony of romeo and juliet fame and a walk 
through the crowded stalls in the marketplace where we ate 
bambolino calorieladen fried dough sprinkled with sugar 
one days highlights included a tour of lugano one of the 
countless small wineries this one operated by luigi fraccaroli 
produced a delicate white wine samples of which were offered to 
the american cyclists a tractor arrived pulling a trailer with 
the first days pickings of the new grape harvest the tourists 
watched as the grapes were crushed 
on day five jennifer and nick surprised the group with a picnic 
feast in the courtyard of an ancient castle on a hilltop outside 
the walled city of soave they loaded a table with fruits cheeses 
meats breads and wines highlighted by bunches of freshpicked 
wildflowers a group photograph was taken for posterity 
after a days ride there was a cocktail party where the days 
events were discussed then a sumptuous dinner 
one evening menu read crepes pasta and smoked ham pasta e 
fagioli alla veneta traditional pasta and beans in a cream soup 
roast beef al pepe or sole a la venetian then choices from a 
breathtaking dessert tray followed by hearty italian coffee all 
accompanied by fine italian wines 
since it was harvest time bowls of incredibly sweet grapes were 
placed in reception areas and guest rooms 
all too soon the bicyclists reached villa corner at cavasagra 
outside venice the final destination 
this was my first tour but i expect well do it again said 
jack blakemore of greenbrae calif 
kathy hillis of nevada city calif said i loved talking to 
all the people it was really neat to ride down the road and say 
buon giorno to the villagers 
it was one unforgettable incident after another said angelo

when shes not at work ann marie wells likes 
wearing bikinis offtheshoulder dresses and slinky long gowns 
she likes men who pick up the check and open doors for her does 
that sound like a marine drill instructor a lady leatherneck 
training recruits at a boot camp rocked a year ago by the lesbian 
mafia scandals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
charging through the boondocks with a 
50pound pack on her back rappelling from a 45foot tower or 
crawling under barbed wire to the chatter of machine guns may seem 
a long way from bergdorfs but marine drill instructor ann marie 
wells doesnt think her chosen career is bizarre 
shoot when women first voted that was considered bizarre 
she says in a demure philadelphia accent reminiscent like her 
upswept strawberry blond hairdo of a young katharine hepburn 
mine just happens to be a career a lot of women dont pick or 
males either for that matter 
staff sgt wells turned up her voice level and barked an order 
at a recruit daydreaming in the shade of a scrawny tree to the 
blamblam lullaby of the adjacent hand grenade course grab your 
war bonnet pyle and doubletime back to your squad 
aye aye maam cried the boot gathering up her m16 rifle 
and disappearing into the woods while trying to jam the new kevlar 
helmet onto a matted mop of pinnedup curls 
platoon 4028 was in its ninth week of boot camp at parris 
island three weeks shy of graduation they were found bivouacked 
in pup tents at the edge of an abandoned airstrip fighting a 
guerrilla war against mosquitoes sand fleas an occasional rattle 
snake and raccoons as big as dogs 
those raccoons thrive on our mres meals ready to eat the 
di explains 
reveille had sounded at 445 am a murky blob of a sun 
promising another blistering humid day barely pinked the 
surrounding marshes when wells doubletimed her 47 charges out to 
the infiltration course 
two dead rats floating in the ditch before a wall that had to be 
scaled added an unscheduled horror to the grueling exercise 
crawl use both legs keep your heels and head down low 
silhouette on that wall wells told her recruits between tnt 
blasts anointing them with mud 
in the control tower synchronizing the detonations so a charge 
went off whenever a recruit crept near a sandbag bunker gunnery 
sgt harvey sanders spotted one boot more terrified of the dead 
rodents than the live explosives she bounded out of the ditch and 
over the wall like an olympic hurdler 
youre dead he rasped over the loudspeaker in a deep 
kentucky drawl you didnt check for booby traps now somebodys 
got to go to your mommy and daddys home and tell them youre dead 
because you didnt listen 
since the marine corps a decade ago mustered out demeaning 
obscenities and an occasional busted lip as too negative an 
approach to molding character drill instructors have resorted to a 
lingua franca rich in morbid humor and inelegant variations just a 
tad shy of the scatological 
camouflaged cussing as one of them called it has made 
trash an allpurpose word as when a di bellows dont give me 
any of that trash or pick up your trash and move out or 
plunge those gun barrels 15 times get all that trash out of 
there 
all prospective women marines go through boot camp at the parris 
island recruit depot under female instructors who work sidebyside 
with male instructors their training is as rugged as males 
undergo except that women spend an extra week honing combat skills 
because they will not be going on to advanced infantry training 
they claim we women will not be going to war and will only be 
used in support but i dont know anyone who believes that wells 
said as her sweatsoaked mudcaked recruits hurried off to the 
last of the three hot showers allotted during their 10 days in the 
field we teach em to be aggressive and to know how to defend 
themselves if it ever comes down to it theyre going to fight 
recruits rarely wear makeup in the field except facial paint 
for combat maneuvers but marines of both sexes slosh on a 
particular brand of bath oil in the belief that it fends off the 
low countrys voracious insects 
they dont completely surrender their femininity observed 
wells looking feminine in her utility field cap polished combat 
boots and a wide shiny black belt the sign of a senior di 
hugging a meryl streep figure in crisply starched cammies 
camouflaged fatigues 
female boots can make appointments at the beauty parlor while 
men get those flattops on a barbershop assembly line they can 
wear their hair any way they want as long as it doesnt fall below 
the shoulder wells says 
female instructors never fancied the smokey the 
broadbrimmed felt hat that their male counterparts tilt over their 
eyes 
instead the distinguishing mark of their profession is a 
braided scarlet cord or pogey rope draped over the left 
shoulder on parade both sexes expertly brandish a ceremonial 
sword 
how did an admittedly shy quiet kind of kid from a roman 
catholic high school in northeast philadelphia wind up swinging on 
a rope like tarzans jane across a murky pond and bellowing roll 
over like a dead roach with your feet in the air at recruits who 
fail to don a gas mask in nine seconds 
the nuns back at st huberts would never believe it says 
wells who turns 24 this month i didnt feel like going on to 
college but i didnt want to do anything ordinary so i joined 
up good at sports she breezed through boot camp became a coach 
on the rifle range went to radio school then spent 9 weeks at 
parris islands coed drill instructors school 
the most strenuous course in the corps proclaims 1st sgt 
larry carson of new orleans the top nco at the di school but 
lady leathernecks dont get any breaks around here when i look 
down that line i dont see males or females i just see marines

in the courtyard beyond his window staff sgt marie price of 
chicago the first female instructor at the di school was 
drilling men and women di candidates in the bombastic basics of 
issuing commands 
their voices may sound different but they got to be loud 
mused the first sergeant these women come to hate me as much as 
the men but after they leave here they have a change of heart 
some even invite me to their weddings 
recruits may doubt it but a drill instructors heart is capable 
of a meltdown leading to matrimony sometimes they marry other 
drill instructors 
and thats total war laughs di sandra love of charlotte 
nc one of wellss cohorts who has undergone an interesting 
change in nomenclature 
before her divorce she was sgt nails and gloried in the mock 
initials ha for hard as nails her modest boast is never 
having met a recruit i couldnt handle but i know my day is 
coming 
in her knife defense class sgt love sent a recruit sprawling 
and nimbly missed staightening her orphan annie curls with a combat 
boot to the cadence cry of grab smash hook twist and stomp 
nothing i like better than seeing marines slamming hard on the 
deck says the close combat instructor identified by the skull 
and crossed bayonets on his tshirt the female of the marine 
species is way deadlier than the male 
the scene was a far cry from a decade ago when women recruits 
were taught how to pour tea and were required to wear girdles 
as di wells receives a 260 increment to her staff sergeants 
basic pay of 1325 a month her working hours from reveille at 
445 am to taps at 845 pm leave little time for romance 
she says while donning a mopp mission orientation protective 
posture suit to lead her platoon into the house of pain the 
gas chamber when were not working were sleeping 
ashore as marines call being away from the depot in navy lingo 
the di enjoys being a young woman i still wear my hair long 
people dont even know im a marine i love wearing bikinis 
offtheshoulder dresses and slinky long gowns 
i like men picking up the dinner check thats survival and 
opening the door for you hey im no brute 
di wells has never been in a situation where she had to employ 
her martial arts skill but stuff has sure happened to a lot of 
my recruits theyve been raped or mugged or something and they 
wish theyd known then how to defend themselves 
almost every new batch of recruits arriving at fourth battalion 
the womens recruit unit includes at least one undetected 
pregnancy several college graduates a number of kids fleeing 
innercity violence or smalltown boredom a couple of jane 
wayne overachievers and always the platoon comic 
comedians help relieve tension as long as their jokes arent 
aimed at us wells says we tell recruits when to laugh and 
when not to 
all recruits have to test drugfree and 99 percent are high 
school graduates although boottype shock incarceration 
programs are being tested at prisons in a dozen states few come to 
parris island straight from the criminal court docket the old 
days of four in the corps or 10 in the pen are gone says gunnery 
sgt sanders hey were choosy now 
drill instructors off duty swap stories about the yoyos who 
march to a different cadence count under the platoon guideon we 
get the female gomer pyles and the pvt benjamins wells says 
they do some funny things 
the pvt benjamins are the best the pretty ones with the 
long fingernails we call them powderpuffs theyve been babied all 
their lives we make them earn their keep 
parris island graduates 19000 new marines a year 1800 of them 
women both sexes have the same dropout rate about 15 percent 
mental stress washes out more of them than the physical 
demands wells says you can always build someone up but some 
cant cope with having to do a couple of things at the same time in 
a hurry 
her outstanding recruit this time around is pvt ramona racquet 
from blossvale ny who stands 4foot9 wears a size 2 shoe 
totes a pack half her weight and outscored all the males on the 
rifle range i call her my minirecruit wells says her feet 
always hurt they cant find boots to fit her but shes proof that 
women can do it all 
parris island is just beginning to rebound from its lesbian 
mafia headlines of a year ago when three women marines were 
jailed and 14 others were administratively discharged for 
homosexual liaisons that included drill instructors and recruits 
now it is facing another social problem of our times single 
parents we get single parents both men and women signing up 
for di school carson says i got a gut feeling theres just 
no way a di can make a good single parent 
down the road a decade or so from now wells sees herself in a 
more sedate career id like to be a housewife with a couple of 
kids but id have to do something else im not much at sitting 
around the back yard 
does she worry that her di past might make her more of 
martinet than a mother bullying even brutalizing her kids like 
the marine parent in the movie the great santini 
who me she asks those big gray eyes widening in shock 
no way shoot the way i treat my recruits why im so nice to 
them they abuse me more than i abuse them

three toxic waste sites in a town of 30000 may 
not be a record but it certainly has got the attention of the 
townspeople of jacksonville ark regardless of which side they 
are on one side is screaming about the stink and the sickness the 
other wants to paint a cheerier picture 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
don bailey remembers hunting swamp 
rabbits as a boy down by the town dump how the frisky rabbits 
would jump when you sneaked up and run for half a mile they made 
good eating 
he also remembers swimming in nearby lake dupree always curious 
about the windwhipped orange foam that lathered its banks 
bailey is now 39 he is so ill he cant work has lost all 
feeling in one arm and his brother and sister also have strange 
allergies and ailments the doctors cant seem to correct 
today the dump has a chainlink fence around it with a red sign 
that says keep out hazardous waste area as for the rabbits 
bailey remembers when their always reliable numbers began to 
dwindle and you had to walk up and kick one to get it to move 
i killed one took it home cut it open and it was yellow as a 
lemon inside he recalls it stank 
jacksonville a town of 30000 just north of little rock is the 
location of three toxic waste sites on the environmental protection 
agencys priority list super fund sites 
thousands of drums containing waste byproducts of nowbanned 
herbicides sit on a covered concrete slab where four chemical 
companies operated for 40 years 
for more than 10 years since the epa first started 
investigating some of the towns citizens have been raising a stink 
of their own they fear they are being poisoned by dioxin 
among 1194 priority cleanup sites across america out of more 
than 30000 nonpriority sites three may not seem like many but 
these citizens feel that in a town this size it is quite a 
distinction though dubious and 10 years is a long time to wait to 
get it cleaned up 
this town is a chemical soup says claudett hazlett and 
im angry about it 
ms hazlett is don baileys sister which would explain her 
anger not to mention her own constant headaches and back problems 
she is also vice president of a group called people against a 
chemically contaminated environment 
on the other hand jacksonville boosters say that the town has 
confronted its problem and is supporting a cleanup and that 
notoriety hurts the towns image 
we are left with a legacy that requires remediation says 
state rep mike wilson fortunately that contamination is 
confined to a very small area that affects no one that we can see 
theres a lot of sex appeal for the media in deadbaby stories 
wilson is spokesman for a group called jacksonville people with 
pride 
a third group jacksonville people with pride cleanup coalition 
was awarded three epa grants of 50000 to hire technical advisers 
to monitor cleanup at all three sites reasorhill chemical corp 
and successors hercules powder co transvaal inc and vertac 
chemical corp 
thats when the dispute boiled over ms hazletts group 
furious told the epa that hercules was a member of the opposition 
group people with pride the government she maintained would be 
paying a transgressor to monitor the cleanup 
epa withdrew the grants 
wilson acknowledges hercules was a member of people with pride 
and people with pride cleanup coalition has many of the same 
members but he says hercules was not one of them 
since we had told epa from the very beginning that hercules 
was a contributor to jacksonville people with pride and they knew 
it i cant understand why they changed their mind says wilson 
now that they have changed their mind we are going to find out 
why

with the grants up for grabs enter a fourth group the 
jacksonville environmental network which encompasses ms hazletts 
group and others who are angry that group has applied for the 
grants and has vowed to oppose any attempt by the coalition group 
to try again for the money by sanitizing its membership 
at least says ms hazlett the epas withdrawal of the grants 
should inspire people nationwide to fight regulatory decisions 
the president of the coalition ruby brown says the group did 
indeed intend to use the technical advisers to play down publicity 
about the contamination but wilson says that is not so 
we have got a proven record wilson says the big picture 
in all this is not whether we or someone else receives a grant the 
purpose of the grant is to educate and inform and we are doing 
that anyway the big picture is solving the problem and that is 
cleaning up this chemical contamination 
meanwhile those barrels of toxic waste remain 
mrk an incineration frim in zachary la received a contract 
in july to do a trial burn next march at the 93acre vertac site 
if tests go well it could start incinerating 25 million tons an 
hour a month later says richard merritt of the arkansas department 
of pollution control and ecology 
vertac which began as a world war ii ordnance plant produced 
the herbicide known as agent orange to incinerate about 28000 
barrels of the ingredients of that herbicide would take about six 
months merrill estimates if the epa judges the ash to be 
nonhazardous it will be put in drums and buried in a landfill 
wilson says there is no medical evidence to link the chemicals 
and the illnesses which ms hazlett concedes for now 
even if the chemicals are burned and buried she says it wont 
slow her crusade she says her group plans to make a doortodoor 
health survey to document community illnesses 
she has her own and her brother don bailey has his and 
bailey says he had a friend who worked at vertac and died of 
cancer bailey says his friend told him the company sent home a 
letter telling his family to wash his clothes separately 
but bailey a slight bearded man with a useless arm hands that 
tremble asthma allergies and chronic headaches says no one ever 
warned him about swimming in the lake with the orange foam or of 
eating the rabbits and the fish he brought home for the family 
table 
they were doing this to people and they knew about it and they 
didnt tell the people about it he says 
but when he opened up a rabbit and it stank didnt he suspect 
it didnt dawn on people what was what he says after all 
those companies provided good jobs for good pay 
the only other big employer in jacksonville is an air force base 
only retribution against the polluters it seems will satisfy 
ms hazlett 
dons life is ruined she says his future is gone and a 
multibilliondollar industry is reaping the profits at the expense 
of somebody like this 
i think its time our government officials stood up and took a 
stand and said thats enough

to satisfy the growing demand for lumber at the 
end of world war ii loggers began cutting down all the trees in 
large sections of forest and replanting the area with trees of a 
commercially desirable species that practice called 
clearcutting has persisted to this day even in publicly owned 
national forests there is one notable exception the shawnee 
national forest in illinois 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
new restrictions on the way loggers 
harvest timber in the vast shawnee national forest in southern 
illinois has given environmentalists hope that others will follow 
suit 
a shawnee management plan that went into effect last year bans 
almost all clearcutting the chopping down of all trees regardless 
of their age in tracts of 20 to 40 acres instead of selective 
cutting of individual trees 
what happened in the shawnee is nationally significant because 
its never happened before says jim bensman of the sierra club 
now you can say look at the shawnee if they can do it why 
cant we 
but the us forest service which manages 156 national forests 
is not rushing into a nationwide ban on clearcutting 
our management philosophy explains f dale robertson 
forest service chief is to let these things be worked out 
locally as it has been done in the shawnee we want to be at peace 
with the local people 
some heated words were exchanged in the battle of the shawnee a 
262000acre forest of oak and hickory bounded on the east by the 
ohio river and on the west by the mississippi river 
joe glisson of the grassroots organization regional association 
of concerned environmentalists called his opposition bumbling 
idiots charles daugherty president of the illinois wood 
products association called glissons group meddlesome folks 
and troublemakers 
somewhere in the middle was the us forest service 
environmentalists say clearcutting causes erosion degrades 
water quality reduces the wildlife habitat and leaves an ugly 
landscape of stumps and ruffled underbrush 
but the forest service while conceding clearcutting adversely 
affects some wildlife maintains its the best method of caring for 
and cultivating forests 
clearcuts the agency argues emulate natural disasters such as 
fires which rejuvenate timber stands the large cuts allow 
sunshine to saturate the forest enhancing growth 
the practice also benefits some game animals such as deer and 
wild turkey the forest service says 
the agency reminds critics that federal law requires it to 
maintain timber for americas use and that without logging roads 
the public would have no access to the forest 
len carey an agency spokesman in washington likens 
clearcutting to harvesting corn 
what about clearcutting in the cornfields isnt that what we 
do grow the corn and cut it down 
the national forest products association points out that the 
timber industry nationally employs 13 million people with an 
annual payroll of 296 billion 
were not the bad guys daugherty says were who make the 
jobs 
chopping individual trees was the predominant method of logging 
before world war ii after the war the forest service approved 
steppedup clearcutting to satisfy the growing demand for lumber 
the goal of clearcutting is twofold the immediate sale of a 
large quantity of timber and the replacement of the natural forest 
with evenaged stands of trees of the commercially preferred 
species 
of the 11 billion to 12 billion board feet cut annually from the 
191 million acres of federal forest land about half is harvested 
by clearcutting says the forest services dick fitzgerald in 
washington 
but the wilderness society puts the figure closer to 75 percent 
the shawnee dispute is rooted in the national forest management 
act of 1976 which required national forests to devise 50year 
management plans 
the act also required that clearcutting only be used when found 
to be the optimum method of tree harvesting 
in november 1986 the shawnee approved its forest plan 
four appeals were filed by environmental groups 
the original draft of the plan emphasized clearcutting as the 
preferred method of harvest and placed annual hardwood harvest 
levels at 126 million board feet a typical 30foot tree yields 
about 1000 board feet 
on aug 15 1988 after mediated talks the agency agreed to 
alter its forest plan eliminating clearcutting almost entirely 
all but one appellant the association of concerned 
environmentalists agreed to drop their appeals 
forest service officials and environmentalists say that while 
management plans in other national forests limit clearcutting 
none comes close to the shawnee 
according to environmentalists many of the ecological problems 
linked to clearcutting are reduced by using individual tree 
selection or group selection smaller cuts in the forest 
leon minckler a consultant on environmental forestry in 
virginia and a 33year veteran of the forest service conducted a 
20year experiment in group selection on the kaskaskia experimental 
forest in southern illinois 
he believes it works 
the forest service has in almost no cases shown that 
clearcutting is the optimum method minckler says it might be 
the optimum method for the logger its not optimum for the 
forest 
minckler says the forest service balks at group selection 
because its timeconsuming and costs more money foresters must 
examine each tree to determine if its ready for the mill 
the agency contends alternatives are unproven albeit mincklers 
research found that under group selection the forest remains highly 
diversified providing a wide range of habitat for wildlife 
but the forest service said more acreage is affected by group 
selection and its smaller cuts in order to get the same harvest 
volume as clearcutting 
the regional association of concerned environmentalists unlike 
the sierra club opposes all clearcutting except for the 
elimination of diseased timber stands a position that riles the 
timber industry 
rich hoppie of the wilderness society called the shawnee 
clearcutting ban a small step 
we want to see it done more he said but we have no 
expectations that the forest service will do so willingly

photogenic trouble is hes not all that fond of picturetaking 
sessions and hes trying to get used to offstage celebrity 
being on stage is the coolest thing he says thats when

kevin paige is climbing billboards bestselling chart

something in music and nobody is going to tell me what approach im 
going to take 
his first show after the album came out was an outdoor date in 
cape cod where dont shut me out was being played on the local 
radio station 
when he came offstage he says all these teenagers started 
trying to get autographs that was the first experience of that 
sort id ever had they were mobbing around me pushing things in 
my face saying sign this it was funny i was laughing the 
whole time they probably wonder what i was laughing about 
they were 8 to 17 or 18 and some ladies actually 
i dont date much paige says i did in high school but i 
was always practicing i was definitely committed to trying to be a 
musician not a husband now im not home to date which is kind of 
bad 
paige who neither smokes nor drinks has lived his music 
he grew up in memphis tenn listening to rhythm n blues on 
the radio 
i guess i was about 10 when i started beating on a snare 
drum he says thats when i knew i was going to be a 
musician he didnt think then about being a singer 
when he was 13 his mother would drive the youngest of her nine 
children to clubs in a black area of memphis where hed play drums 
in a black band shed wait for him and drive him home 
i was trying the other day to analyze what i really like about 
rhythm n blues paige says its the soul and emotion thats 
put into it but thats what any kind of music is when you think 
about it 
paiges father who has a doctorate and taught voice at a 
memphis college would have liked him to go to college if only to 
have something solid to fall back on 
but paige says my idea was how could i make it good if i 
wasnt really committed to doing it the day after i graduated from 
high school i immediately hit the road thats how i made my money 
touring the college fraternity circuit all around the south in a 
band nonstop for a couple of years 
after he quit the band paige made a tape of songs hed written 
and performed and sent it to record companies nobody got back to 
me i thought thats not going to work id better go up there 
myself ive got friends in memphis who are recording people they 
said it was pretty hopeless to do that 
but he wrote some better songs performed them better and in 
1987 arrived in new york with two sisters who came on vacation 
he brought a new tape that he took to 20 record companies i came 
knowing nobody i knew it was going to be pretty scary i knew they 
probably werent going to listen to it 
most didnt but two did and one had a good reaction chrysalis 
phoned him a month later they obviously saw something some 
talent they could develop 
paige wrote nine of his albums 10 songs all but one after 
chrysalis signed him making the record he played almost all the 
instruments on it overdubbing i played all the synthesizers and 
piano bass guitar rhythm guitar all the drums that are on there 
most of the drums are machines i programmed them i like doing 
that 
making the record was a blast trying to promote your record 
is hard once the record is out its like school is back in 
session the record company has got you going somewhere different 
every day 
asked what he thinks is his strongest quality he says being 
nice 
people like working with you when youre not an arrogant rock 
n roller he says the guy who signed me was patient with me 
when i was developing songs if i had had an attitude problem or an 
ego who has time for that 
paige and his band will tour i didnt just hire people he 
says the band is all my friends and theyre really great 
musicians too its a cool situation to be in 
if the single gets enough success well pick up somebodys 
tour and open for them if we dont pick up one well go out on 
our own in small clubs

for more than 60 years show boat has been a 
part of william hammersteins life 
he remembers being taken by his father to the old ziegfeld 
theater where he would stand in the wings beside the stage 
managers desk to watch the musical about capn andy hawks his 
daughter magnolia gambler gaylord ravenal joe the black 
stevedore and all the others aboard a mississippi river showboat 
called the cotton blossom 
he also recalls sitting in helen morgans dressing room and 
gazing at the stars pet goldfish 
she was very nice to me and i was only 9 or 10 years old at 
the time says hammerstein of the woman who became a broadway 
legend after she sang cant help lovin dat man and bill in 
the musical 
but what impressed me the most about the show was capn andys 
play within the play it was a little vaudeville piece and a lot of 
fun and of course i remember ol man river in those days they 
had 16 male singers that was a lot of sound 
nearly 20 years after the musicals premiere hammerstein stood 
in the same place backstage at the ziegfeld and watched the show 
again this time as stage manager of the 1946 revival 
today hes still watching over the show having directed it in 
various revivals all over the country since then most recently he 
served as production consultant for an opulent threehour revival 
of the musical taped last summer at the paper mill playhouse in new 
jersey for public televisions great performances and scheduled for 
viewing friday in most cities 
hammerstein is the oldest son of oscar hammerstein ii the man 
who wrote the book and lyrics jerome kern did the music for 
what many people consider the greatest american musical 
i think im the only living person who remembers most of the 
productions of show boat and was closely connected with them 
says the 70yearold hammerstein during his career he has 
produced television specials worked for various broadway producers 
such as leland hayward and directors such as joshua logan and 
garson kanin and supervised many other hammerstein properties 
the new television production of show boat stars eddie 
bracken as capn andy rebecca baxter as magnolia richard white as 
ravenal and shelly burch as the doomed julie laverne the role 
originated by miss morgan its a cast drawn from a wide range of 
backgrounds including opera broadway and television 
theyre all wonderful hammerstein says richard white is 
the best ravenal ive ever seen what he has that none of the 
others did is a kind of humorous approach to the character he 
takes the role seriously hes amused with magnolia when he first 
meets her and then that amusement becomes affection 
i also love rebecca baxter he adds shes young fresh 
and innocent and then in the second act she takes command like 
she should as a mature woman 
but the role of capn andy is the spoke of the wheel hes the 
dynamo the propeller of the showboat he holds it together hes 
the most important element in the musical and eddie understood 
that completely 
show boat has had several major revivals in new york over 
the years the last being a version done by the houston grand opera 
at the gershwin theater in 1983 
and last year there was renewed interest in the musical with the 
release of a complete recording of the show by musical theater 
historian and conductor john mcglinn the recording of more than 
three hours of material contains nearly every song written for 
show boat both stage and movie versions 
hammerstein applauds mcglinns effort but says a stage version 
of show boat with all the cut material reinstated is unwise and 
unnecessary 
john has done a great service by doing that record for 
students of the theater hammerstein says but when people of 
talent and experience write songs for musical shows and then go on 
the road the idea is to make the show better and better in the 
course of doing that they will frequently remove some material and 
add others 
to suddenly say here are all the songs that were cut from 
the show arent they wonderful well some of them are wonderful 
but they dont belong in the show 
the new television version virtually follows the original 
staging says hammerstein except for the addition of ah still 
suits me a comic duet for joe and his wife queenie the song 
was added to the 1936 movie version for paul robeson who played 
joe 
hammerstein is a passionate champion of show boat it began 
he says the great age of american musicals an era that later saw 
oklahoma and carousel written by his father and richard 
rodgers that era continued with lerner and loews my fair lady 
and may have ended with fiddler on the roof by jerry bock and 
sheldon harnick 
i think show boat has qualities about it that are lasting 
like some of the great operas he says there was a period when 
the french wrote great operas there was a period when the italians 
wrote great operas and i think the same thing happened with the 
american musical it came into its own in the 1930s and developed 
during the 1940s and 1950s and in the 60s the musical sort of 
faded out

esther smith the girl who sings about the boy 
next door in meet me in st louis was one of the most 
soughtafter roles of the new broadway season and one of the most 
difficult to cast 
impossible to cast insists jay binder a top broadway 
casting agent and the man who helped put the performers on stage in 
rumors and jerome robbins broadway two of last seasons 
biggest hits 
you have to find someone to play a role that was created 
expressly for judy garland says binder referring to the 
legendary singer who was esther in the memorable 1945 film version 
what you have to do is not even try he says you have to 
find someone who can play esther and not judy garland 
louis burke producer and director of the lavish musical goes a 
step further 
i was looking for somebody who had her own personality that 
would make us forget garland he says 
during a 15month crosscountry expedition burke and binder 
saw some 2500 actresses they had to listen to what seemed like 
neverending renditions of the boy next door have yourself a 
merry little christmas and the trolley song the shows 
bestknown numbers 
today if i hear the trolley song i recoil in horror 
binder sighs 
among the first performers to audition back in june 1988 was a 
former junior miss runnerup named donna kane best known to new 
york audiences as pert tapdancing little ruby in the 1985 revival 
of dames at sea she didnt know it then but she was burkes 
first choice for the role 
the very first day i saw her i knew there was a magic there 
that was pretty extraordinary burke says now that was my gut 
reaction 
and donna actually was quite clever she wore a very lovely 
white lace dress with a blue sash around her waist that seemed to 
fit the character it impresses me when people prepare themselves 
for auditions 
but burke and binder felt they had to continue the search 
looking at everyone who wanted to audition so kane didnt meet 
again with burke until february when she auditioned twice more 
with a series of different actors being considered for other roles 
in the musical 
you do everything over again kane says now i sang the 
same songs i worked on a few more scenes i was matched up with 
different boys next door sisters mothers and fathers 
when it finally looked as if the show would arrive late last 
season financial problems forced its postponement until this fall 
kane went off to do show boat with the minnesota opera and a 
successful concert of rodgers and harts babes in arms at 
lincoln center when she returned to meet me in st louis 
there was a fourth audition at the neil simon theater and then a 
final audition with jason workman the actor chosen to play john 
truitt the boy next door 
sometimes i thought it was really going to happen she 
recalls and other times i would say no you cant count on 
things until it is definite 
it became definite only in late summer burke picked her to 
appear in the musical with george hearn and charlotte moore who 
play her parents milo oshea who is her grandfather and betty 
garrett who plays the irish cook katie 
the stage version of meet me in st louis on view at 
broadways gershwin theater has been trumpeted as a family show 
an oldfashioned american musical something broadway hasnt had 
for a while its songwriters hugh martin and ralph blane have 
expanded on their original movie score adding 10 new songs 
they definitely dont write music like this any more kane 
says the songs have melodies that are not only catchy and 
memorable but emotional too 
theres a whole new bridge section to the boy next door 
which will be a surprise to people she says and theres a new 
duet that esther and the boy next door sing called you are for 
loving its a beautiful melody with a wonderful counterpoint 
meet me in st louis is kanes first chance to originate a 
role on broadway she had come to new york in 1984 after graduating 
from mount holyoke as a political science major but she had two 
summers of stock in vermont while in college 
its helped me in the theater to have a liberal arts 
education she says as an actor you have to analyze the text 
critically besides you cant just focus on the performing arts 
her first job in new york was in a small musical called 
madison avenue for which she answered an ad in the trade 
papers the job called for a seven sisters graduate and she fit the 
bill 
next came dames at sea which kept her occupied for nearly a 
year after that there were productions of shows like my one and 
only in suburban new york and new jersey 
kane wasnt idle while she waited for word from burke and 
binder she performed in a show in boston went on tour with 
grease and moved to england for four months with her husband 
mark staples an oil trader 
born in beacon ny she was raised on long island and new 
jersey her parents were in education not show business 
my grandfather was a singer on the radio in the 1930s and 
40s she says i have his legacy a piano which is one of my 
most cherished possessions 
the best advice kane ever got from a voice teacher was when she 
was 8 years old the teacher told her mother shes not doing 
anything wrong leave her alone 
i was fortunate that i never had a style or technique imposed 
on me she says now 
she doesnt worry about the comparisons to judy garland 
i have not watched the movie on purpose during the rehearsal 
process she says growing up id seen it many times of 
course some people in the cast have watched the film others 
havent but were not trying to compare ourselves to it 
im just trying to concentrate on the character of esther not 
who played it shes a very honest and very sincere person and to 
be able to produce that vocally as well as act it out is just 
great

campaigning is under way for 
brazils first presidential election by popular vote in 29 years 
but candidates are concentrating more on clean government than the 
countrys perilous economic problems 
on nov 15 about 82 million voters will be eligible to pick a 
successor to jose sarney the first civilian president since a 
military coup in 1964 routed the leftleaning populist joao 
goulart sarney took office as a result of a vote by an electoral 
college 
about 73 percent of the electorate brazilians under the age of 
47 will be voting directly for a president for the first time in 
their lives also for the first time brazilians as young as 16 
will be allowed to vote about 33 million 16 and 17yearolds 
have registered but they are not required by law to vote as are 
those 18 and over 
brazil is seen by many here and abroad as a nation teetering on 
the edge of economic financial and social chaos and which way it 
goes depends heavily on the outcome of the election 
there is a profound revolt against the political economic and 
social system that hasnt been able to meet the peoples 
expectations said helio jaguaribe director of the institute of 
political and social studies in rio de janeiro 
this is the last chance for finding a rational solution if 
the next government cannot deal adequately with this builtup 
crisis the tendency is for the country to degenerate into chaos 
and hyperinflation and to become ungovernable 
the last presidential election in 1960 saw the election of janio 
quadros who served just eight months before resigning in august 
1961 and setting off a chain of events that led to the 1964 
military takeover 
since that time brazil has become the western worlds 
eighthlargest economy but its foreign debt has soared from 2 
billion to 110 billion the largest in the third world its 
annual inflation rate has soared to 1200 percent and the minimum 
wage has eroded to the equivalent of 1750 a week 
many brazilians are dissatisfied with sarney a 59yearold 
rancher and poet who has headed the civilian government since a 
military regime stepped aside in 1985 
his leadership is blamed for the soaring inflation and 
corruption which indisputably in brazilian minds has hit almost 
every level of his administration 
but popular resentment runs deeper 
the powerful sense of opposition in this election is not so 
much against sarney himself as against parties politicians and the 
whole political establishment jaguaribe said 
as a result the candidates focus on change and clean 
government issues such as how to repay the foreign debt have 
become secondary 
i want to rebuild this country stone by stone brick by 
brick frontrunner fernando collor de mello said in a recent 
campaign speech other candidates have made similar promises in 
generalized terms 
twentytwo candidates are on the ballot 
collor de mello former governor of the poor northeastern state 
of alagoas and one of sarneys harshest critics gained national 
attention by firing state employees with exorbitant salaries 
popularly known as maharajas riding a new wave of popularity 
he formed the centerright national reconstruction party in 1988 
and entered the presidential race 
i will get rid of the maharajas of the financial system and 
build a new brazil without inflation without maharajas and without 
corruption he told a recent rally 
however collor de mellos standing in the polls skidded from 44 
percent in august to 34 percent in early october after the press 
published charges of shady financial dealings and political 
cronyism in his own administration in alagoas 
his closest challenger is leonel brizola of the centerleft 
democratic labor party a former governor of rio de janeiro state 
and a backer in the 1960s of joao goulart because of his 
associatons with goulart who is now dead brizola fled into exile 
after the military coup but returned under a 1979 amnesty he still 
faces opposition within the armed forces 
brizola as president means change he said in a campaign 
speech it will be the beginning of the end for the present 
economic model of colonial capitalism which was imposed by the 
right and recently shoved down our throats by the dictatorship 
he scored 14 percent in octobers polls 
other major candidates 
luis inacio lula da silva of the marxistoriented workers 
party a congressman and former metalworkers union leader he says 
he would redistribute land and wealth proposes a suspension of 
payments on the foreign debt and calls for an audit of how the 
borrowed money was spent a frontrunner early on the october 
polls gave him 9 percent of the vote 
paulo maluf of the rightist social democratic party a 
millionaire businessman and former governor of sao paulo maluf 
promises lawandorder and public works he had the backing of the 
military in his unsuccessful contest in the electoral college vote 
for president in 1985 polls gave him 8 percent of the vote 
guilherme afif domingos of the rightofcenter liberal party a 
wealthy businessman banker and congressman from sao paulo afif 
promotes an image as the enlightened probusiness candidate he 
rose sharply in the october polls to 7 percent and gained 
nationwide media attention 
ulysses guimaraes of the brazilian democratic labor party the 
speaker of brazils house of representatives under sarney 
guimaraes for years led the opposition to the military regime but 
his close association with sarney has hurt his popularity the 
polls gave him 4 percent 
roberto freire of the brazilian communist party a congressman 
from the northeastern sugargrowing state of pernambuco freire is 
an admirer of the policies of italys communist party the largest 
in the west but his nowlegal party still frightens large numbers 
of brazilians polls in october gave him just 1 percent 
because brazil is so large with population centers widely 
scattered television and radio are playing vital roles in the 
campaign the government has ordered all tv and radio stations to 
carry twiceaday 70minute shows devoted to the candidates and 
their campaigns 
about 100 million of brazils 145 million people have access to 
television and the candidates are concentrating heavily on that 
audience 
the result so far has been mostly vague campaign promises more 
and better housing schools transportation and food production 
with few candidates saying specifically how they would bring about 
such improvements 
few candidates explain in any detail how they would deal with 
the economy 
collor de mello says he would cut inflation by ending waste and 
by privatizing government property but the only government 
property he has proposed selling are government mansions in 
brasilia the capital now used rentfree by cabinet ministers 
the new president is due to take office march 15 for a fiveyear 
term 
however sarney is under pressure to step down soon after the 
election following the example of neighboring argentina there 
the outgoing president raul alfonsin scheduled to leave office in 
december handed the presidency to the peronist carlos menem in 
july

zaw ye says he fled to the jungle after 
being beaten by soldiers with truncheons in rangoon and seeing a 
young woman who tried to help him pinned to the ground and killed 
by a bayonet thrust through her temple 
also at the demonstration in the burmese capital he said 
another woman student near him was struck in the head and as she 
reeled a second blow popped one of her eyes out 
zaw ye and other students then came to a conclusion we 
realized that no peaceful protests debates or strikes would work 
the only course is to resort to arms 
he and his companions slipped from rangoon after that 
demonstration in july and joined nearly 5000 others who had 
escaped earlier 
they are pledged to fight burmas military government until 
democracy is won 
but democracy appears to have become a distant glimmer for the 
millions of burmese who marched in the streets last year and faced 
the blazing guns of soldiers who finally put down the uprising in 
september 1988 
since then a 17member junta the state law and order 
restoration council has wielded power it has promised elections 
next may and is allowing more than 200 political parties to form 
but it simultaneously has arrested several thousand dissidents and 
silenced the main opposition leaders 
after the council took power the first wave of about 10000 
protesters leaving wives and families behind sought the 
protection of ethnic minority rebels along burmas rugged borders 
with thailand india and china 
about half of them returned however enticed by a government 
promise of amnesty and unable to put up with disease malnutrition 
and other hardships but the border movement did not falter as some 
had predicted 
the military council initially tried to make amends with an 
angry population and refurbish its brutal image internationally it 
allowed the daughter of national hero aung san to campaign and draw 
huge crowds 
but in late july when protests broke out and speeches by aung 
sans daughter suu kyi grew increasingly strident the military 
struck again she was placed under house arrest and martial law was 
tightened the united states charged that political detainees were 
being tortured 
a second wave of dissidents fled to the frontiers describing 
rangoon as a prison where people feared the military intelligence 
and the nighttime knock on the door 
the release of suu kyi was one of the demands of two 
prodemocracy students who hijacked an burmese airliner to thailand 
with 83 others on board oct 6 the students surrendered to thai 
authorities after the burmese ambassador in thailand rejected their 
demands for a return to democracy 
today the all burma students democratic front claims a 
membership of more than 4800 students young professionals 
buddhist monks and others at 24 border camps compared to a year 
ago they appear to be tougher and better organized but also 
largely forgotten by the rest of the world 
we have a rough journey ahead of us said the fronts 
general secretary than win 
some students contrast their own status to that of students who 
fled military repression in china in june the chinese are given 
scholarships at us and other universities and international 
platforms to voice their protests the few burmese students who 
tried have had difficulties entering the united states and 
recently thailand eager for economic deals with the burmese 
government expelled those who had crossed into its territory 
life is marginal at camps like the one here at mawke a base for 
260 students who fight alongside the karen national union one of 
many ethnic rebel armies struggling for greater autonomy in burma 
set in a forest near the thai frontier the camp is a collection 
of crudely fashioned thatch huts offering little protection from 
monsoon rains two sleepers must sometimes share one blanket and 
there are few mosquito nets leaders say 75 percent of the student 
soldiers have suffered from malaria each can obtain only about 
350 worth of food rations a month 
the karentrained students at mawke have only about 100 weapons 
of assorted makes and the ammunition they carry most likely would 
run out in about 10 minutes of combat they acknowledge they could 
not face a main force burmese unit without karen help 
student leaders emphasize propaganda work in villages deeper 
inside burma where they claim to be warmly received units pass out 
leaflets give talks entertain and help villagers clear trails 
dig latrines and build small schools 
an hours walk from mawke the student front has built a school 
for its own members opened aug 1 as the jungle university 
its staff of teachers and doctors who fled with the students 
teaches political science english thai basic medicine 
agriculture and other subjects 
the students hope the us congress will pass legislation that 
would provide them up to 225 million worth of assistance to 
supplement the meager funds they now receive from various burmese 
exile groups and other private donors 
the united states and much of the inernational community have 
shunned burma politically since last year but the military 
government has been able to attract some investors by opening the 
country to foreign businessmen for the first time in a quarter 
century 
critics charge that much of the badly needed foreign currency 
being earned goes to buy weapons for the fight against the ethnic 
minorities with whom the students are allied 
although one western diplomat based in rangoon said that the 
students have been wrecked or driven to the border into 
irrelevance other analysts give more balanced assessments and 
the student front sees itself at the forefront of the prodemocracy 
fight 
the fronts chairman htun aung kyaw said that despite the 
sweeping arrests of dissidents the border camps can maintain links 
with underground antigovernment cells in burma their own ranks 
he said could easily be swelled from the interior but this is 
discouraged because the camps could not cope with an influx 
we are young brave and we are not selfish the chairman 
added in an interview students are the only ones the people 
trust we give the people inside courage and can tell the outside 
world what is happening in our country 
students have traditionally been at the cutting edge of burmese 
politics and the front hopes to endow itself with the aura of 
future leadership 
last february 30 student leaders met to seal their pledge to 
end authoritarian rule by drinking drops of their own blood mixed 
in a silver cup 
it was the same ritual burmas nearly legendary thirty 
comrades went through during world war ii when they pledged to 
liberate the country from the british

old gringo 
 
moviemaking in the grand tradition returns with old gringo 
a richly textured adventure of revolution and passion it is graced 
with a truly magnificent performance by gregory peck as the 
tormented authorreporter ambrose bierce unfortunately the film 
is flawed by the ambivalence of a major character and an ending 
that dissipates the dramatic values 
what happened to bierce who disappeared during the 1916 mexican 
revolution the distinguished mexican author carlos fuentes 
speculated in his novel gringo viejo and aida bortnik and luis 
puenzo elaborated on his fable in their screenplay the story is 
fiercely ironic and novelistic but strangely constructed as a 
screen entertainment 
most of the excitement is contained in the first third of the 
film thereafter it bogs down in a romantic triangle that is 
resolved anticlimactically 
the characters are drawn in bold colors jane fonda is a 
washington spinster who breaks away from her mothers firm control 
to work as schoolmarm for rich mexican landowners peck is the 
fiery iconoclast bierce so depressed by the failure of his 
literary career that he courts death amid the violence of the 
revolution a bold lieutenant of pancho villa jimmy smits la 
law is a fearless leader of the peasant uprising 
fonda arrives at the landowners compound to find it under siege 
by the peasant army the owners having fled she stays on in 
sympathy with the peasants cause and awed by the powerful 
personalities of the revolutionary leader and the sardonic 
journalist both seek her virginity peck hesitantly smits with 
passion 
luis puenzo whose admirable argentinemade the official 
story won the 1986 academy award as best foreign language film 
deftly interprets the human relationships he also handles action 
with skill the siege of the compound is worthy of john ford but 
it happens early in the movie 
the rest of the film is devoted to the moral dilemma of the 
revolutionary the bastard son of the landowner he struggles like 
a roughhewn hamlet over whether to claim his heritage or join 
villa as ordered when he finally makes up his mind he reacts with 
senseless violence 
the best element of old gringo is peck in the title role it 
is fascinating to watch an old pro in the peak of form playing a 
character who befits his stature jane fonda whose company made 
the film registers strongly after she abandons her wideeyed 
wonder jimmy smits despite his characters indecision 
establishes himself as a bigscreen star 
the columbia pictures release was produced by lois bonfiglio 
with david wisnievitz as executive producer rating is r for 
language violence and a bedroom scene running time 119 minutes

thelonious monk straight no chaser 
 
thelonious sphere monk lived up to his name he practiced 
ascetism in his spareness with words and notes 
a documentary about the jazz composer and pianist thelonious 
monk straight no chaser respects that spareness by focusing 
on monks legacy to american music the joy he took in creating a 
new kind of jazz 
this is no artsy movie filled with chitchat about monk and how 
he was such a mysterious character and how he revolutionized jazz 
and all that it doesnt dispel all of the mystery his persona 
projected but it does allow us to listen to a lot of his music and 
to realize his genius 
if monk wasnt much interested in making small talk or even 
communicating with those around him its clear he was absorbed in 
his musical world 
i mean it is hard work to play those 88 piano keys monk 
tells some reporter type who asks a dumb question about whether the 
piano has enough keys 
as a documentary straight no chaser also the name of a 
famous monk tune suffers from a lack of good footage the early 
years are shown in a succession of stills that dont tell much 
except that monk was a revolutionary who wore suits and ties 
however its sheer pleasure to watch and listen to duo piano 
performances by tommy flanagan and barry harris that underline the 
beauty of monks music 
tenor saxophonist charlie rouse who played with monk for more 
than a decade says that thelonius was like a founder he 
laid down the foundation of modern jazz called bebop in the 
beginning 
fortunately in 1967 west german television commissioned 
documentary filmmaker michael blackwood to do a cinema verite 
special on monk the 14 hours of film from that onetime broadcast 
forms the basis of much of the film unfortunately too much of 
that footage is shots of monk and his family and fellow musicians 
in airports and hotels 
to the stock footage coproducers charlotte zwerin who also

checking out virgin vision vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
ray macklin is perfectly healthy but obsessed with the certainty 
hes about to die his pursuit of an illness to cure makes 
checking out very funny and very strange just right for a 
night at home 
jeff daniels with his classic good looks is wonderful as 
macklin whose life is thrown off kilter when his jokester pal 
drops dead at a barbecue just before telling the punchline 
macklins maudlin attitude hits his wife jenny melanie 
mayron whom he virtually ignores except to tell her not to use 
salt and his boss michael tucker who suddenly is faced with a 
crazed employee 
the boss tries to calm macklin with such words of wisdom about 
his friends death as its the hotel of life you check out and 
they come and make up the room 
when macklin actually faces death he imagines a heaven that 
looks like a tacky beach resort and offers all the freedom of a 
strict grammar school 
jokes about death pervade the movie and if they are a bit 
offputting at the start they become endearing and actually in the 
end serve to celebrate the joy of life 
the acting is fine with everyone treating the bizarre material 
as if it was most ordinary careful viewers can catch david byrne 
of the talking heads in a small role as a bartender 
checking out was written by joe eszterhas flashdance 
and jagged edge and directed by david leland wish you were 
here

say anything cbsfox video vhsbeta 8998 rated pg13 
 
in say anything a pair of blushing teenagers fall oh 
dont say it ummm well really no really oh im so happy 
i love you too 
its that kind of movie its predictable but its tender and 
it accurately captures those awkward lovely painful moments of 
being both in love and a teenager 
the story centers on lloyd john cusack a likeable guy who is 
a little low on ambition and diane court ione skye school 
valedictorian hyperachiever and a striking beauty lloyds pals 
call her a brain a brain trapped in the body of a game show 
hostess 
the romance would flourish if werent for dianes 
overprotective father when dad asks about lloyds goal in life 
lloyd says pointblank that its to spend as much time possible 
with his daughter 
cameron crowe who wrote fast times at ridgemont high makes 
his directing debut with say anything and wonderfully captures 
offbeat and witty nuances of teen tribulations 
there is for instance lloyds friend who wrote 65 songs about 
her boyfiend joe who dumped her in another scene lloyd gets an 
earful of advice from the boys hanging out a convenience store 
parking lot that leads lloyd to ask them why if they know so much 
about women are they at a gasnsip on a saturday night 
the big flaw is an annoying competitive subplot concerning 
dianes father who is in trouble with the internal revenue 
service it nags on the main plot of the struggling romance like a 
bad habit 
but love endures and this charming film overcomes its plot 
problems to leave viewers feeling warm and fuzzy but hardly 
surprised

raw like sushi virgin neneh cherry 
 
in the postmadonna era danceoriented female singers seem a 
dime a dozen but newcomer neneh cherry seems to have the talent to 
stand out in the crowd 
the young londonbased singers raw like sushi is a fresh 
mix of pop rap and house music with a bravado sure to appeal to 
girls growing up in a changing world 
the debut album has a shimmering urban sound firmly 
contemporary but avoiding the cliches that are rife in this genre 
cherry samples a variety of found sounds such as malcolm 
mclarens buffalo girls on her own buffalo stance and 
stevie wonders living for the city 
cherry herself a mother sternly defends the rights of children 
on the next generation she calls on fathers to stand up for 
their parental responsibilities and society to fix crumbling school 
systems 
whats this sitting on my lap she asks its the next 
generation 
buffalo stance is already a hit and kisses on the wind 
is high on the charts now both deservedly so manchild a 
ballad with a combination of singing and rapping and the 
toughminded heart are both noteworthy 
cherry is a serviceable singer but an even better rapper with a 
sassy style 
if shes not yet ready to challenge madonna for her crown at 
least cherry can keep the blond one company on the charts for 
awhile

missa prolationum marian motets by johannes ockeghem the 
hilliard ensemble emi 
 
little is known about johannes ockeghem 14201477 he spent 
much of his adult life serving the kings of france and achieved a 
lofty reputation among musicians of the day and in later centuries 
ockeghems total known output consists of 20 chansons 12 masses 
three partial masses and a handful of motets 
he also came to have the reputation of dry academician because 
of his mastery of composition the beauty of this mass shows 
clearly the opposite especially with the feeling interpretation by 
the hilliard ensemble made up of two altos three tenors a 
baritone and two basses 
the missa prolationum perhaps ockeghems greatest work is a 
landmark the first mass to use a canon or successively repeated 
melody in all its parts paired or individual voices sing the 
same melody but in different meters and intervals 
in the bigger picture of music history ockeghem represents a 
new kind of musical thinking a departure from the idea of a basic 
melody around which music is constructed and a move towards using 
an ideagenerating theme that unifies an entire pieces development 
the performance here is just right the atmosphere is 
otherworldly and serene but not cold the singers are absolutely 
precise in their joint entrances and phraseendings chords burst 
forth like a flood of light through a cathedrals rose window and 
solo voices weave a tapestry of sound one minor caveat perhaps 
because of the recording conditions sybillant consonants seem to 
jump out of the texture creating a distracting effect

they come from different backgrounds a 
generation apart but gregory peck and jimmy smits have one thing 
in common they both suffer stage fright 
peck gets stage fright after 45 years in films 
i always do confesses the 73yearold star who portrays the 
iconoclastic author ambrose bierce in old gringo costarring 
with jane fonda and smits 
when i went down to rehearse in mexico i was playing catchup 
because originally burt lancaster was to play the role they were 
already rehearsing and jane knew all of her lines backwards 
forwards and sideways while i was carrying a script in my hand 
when we first rehearsed a scene she embraced me her tears were 
flowing and i was trying to hold onto my script peck said 
jane was totally into the scene and i was about 8000 miles 
behind i had a bit of stage fright the first day or two that 
happens with every movie nothing unusual about that 
smits 33 had more reason to be nervous he was making the leap 
from tvs la law to a 24 million epic with two screen 
legends 
i would be lying to you if i said i wasnt nervous the first 
couple of days of shooting he said 
besides the fact that i was working with jane fonda and 
gregory peck on the first couple of days i was involved in an 
exterior scene that had 150 extras i was on a horse carrying a 
rifle and i spoke in two different languages it was an exercise in 
shifting lots of gears at the same time 
i went home that first night and i cried a little bit because 
i didnt think i was up to spec but they liked what i did 
peck speaks well of his young costar jimmy is welltrained 
and schooled holds a masters degree from cornell university in 
fine arts has worked with joe papp has done shakespeare in the 
park has done the classics hes studied voice hes studied 
movement hes a trained young artist hes ready for bigger 
things hes wonderful in la law but hes going to be a movie 
star 
peck grew up in idyllic la jolla calif the lonely son of a 
divorced druggist he became interested in acting while studying 
premed at the university of california berkeley he later went 
east to study at the neighborhood playhouse after a few stage 
roles he was signed to contracts with fox mgm selznick and rko 
and became an instant star a host of memorable roles followed 
to kill a mocking bird winning him the academy award in 1962 
pecks film roles have been sparse in recent years but he 
welcomed the challenge of playing the enigmatic bierce who wrote 
the devils dictionary 
he was pretty much a misanthrope the actor said i think 
that he had great love for his family and treated them badly and 
knew that he had i think he had great remorse about the shambles 
of his personal life also he was disappointed and disillusioned 
by the failure of his 12volume collected works 
it was in that rather gloomy mood that he decided first to go 
on a nostalgic tour of the civil war battlefields in tennessee 
where he fought as a young man he was born in 1840 then on to el 
paso and he decided well its not to late for excitement he 
decided to join the pancho villa revolution he got as far as 
chihuahua bought a white horse and set off across the desert in 
search of a band of revolutionaries he disappeared from the face 
of the earth 
old gringo is based on the carlos fuentes novel that 
fictionizes bierces fate the director is argentine luis puenzo 
whose the official story won an oscar 
peck has no plans to heat up his film career 
im working as much as i like he commented i dont want 
to do if i can avoid it anything mediocre its kind of unseemly 
at my age to come out in a turkey so im just going to sit back 
my wife and i are globetrotters we get around a lot ive had 
fun the last couple of weeks at the house ive had a stonemason a 
painter a plumber whos got to come back also a tree surgeon 
i like that kind of thing nestbuilding 
ive got four kids who are all doing interesting things he 
said one son is a banker and a freefall parachute jumper 
another is making a documentary right now in afghanistan and 
vietnam my daughter is appearing with the martha graham dance 
company in new york and my son anthony has just sold a screenplay 
to fox i follow all of them with great interest and its probably 
the most fun i have 
smits came from a different background he was born in 
manhattan son of a puerto rican mother and a father from suriname 
he was one of three children of a family of lowermiddleclass 
laborers 
we moved around a lot when i was young he recalled that 
had something to do with my becoming an actor i didnt have a lot 
of lasting friendships i played a lot by myself i madebelieve a 
lot i think that was where the acting germ was planted along 
the way there were people who influenced me to continue my 
education if i was interested in theater 
the fascinating thing is that in acting on any given day you 
can be a king or a beggar i found that i could channel my energy 
into research i was never a very good student but when it related 
to a role i could spend hours in the library researching 18th 
century england or mexico 
besides new york plays smits appeared in the films running 
scared and the believers then was cast as the dedicated 
lawyer victor sifuentes in la law that he admitted 
accelerated his career 
in terms of notoriety and success as an actor most 
definitely he said i had been working a lot offbroadway and 
in regional theater but la law was really a turning point and 
a good one

metropolitan opera soprano dawn upshaws next 
production will be a baby 
she once watched a tv program in which baritone robert merrill 
interviewed renowned sopranos who have sung tosca and recalls 
that several said they decided not to have children because it 
would interrupt their careers 
but upshaw who is married to musicologist michael nott always 
wanted a family and is expecting her baby in november i think 
that has always been first and will always come first im not 
really as eager to get out there to do as much as i can and sing in 
every country 
she thinks maybe in 10 years shell even stop traveling to sing 
and start teaching 
though her husband travels with her visiting libraries and 
writing wherever they are theyre both ready to go home after six 
or seven weeks away from their apartment near lincoln center 
without trying too hard to sing abroad though upshaw receives 
engagements she sang pamina in the magic flute with the 
netherlands opera last fall and was engaged for her debut in 
frankfurt and vienna next fall singing pamina im glad to get 
to these two cities upshaw says theyre important opera 
houses itll be easy traveling with a baby i want to take 
advantage of traveling while its easier 
her last long performing trip was seven weeks in 
aixenprovence france singing despina in cosi fan tutti she 
also sang pamina while six months pregnant 
by that time i was feeling a fair amount of movement she 
said at one point i was sort of thrown down on the floor as i 
was singing pamina i supported myself well with my hands on the 
way down i had to lie there several seconds the baby would always 
kick get off of me 
a month later she sang susanna in the marrige of figaro at 
wolftrap in virginia 
its her wedding day shes not supposed to be pregnant 
upshaw says so the company padded her into general plumpness in 
september she went to the midwest to sing a concert with the 
minnesota orchestra a recital at illinois wesleyan university in 
bloomington ill her alma mater and at a friends wedding 
after college where she concentrated on concert and recital 
work more than opera her teacher and father of her now husband 
david nott suggested she audition for new york voice teacher ellen 
faull she did and entered the manhattan school of music as a faull 
pupil 
i still study with her i can take anything to her that im 
concerned about and trust her opinion probably more than my own 
upshaw said 
faulls suggestion was that upshaw enter the metropolitan opera 
auditions for young singers so that one of the judges who runs the 
mets young artists development program would hear her the 
strategy worked in the 198485 season upshaw was taken into the 
program which yearly puts half a dozen fledgling singers on the 
met stage in small roles training them for major parts 
upshaws met debut was as countess ceprano in rigoletto 
shes a flirt who has about two lines she flirts with the 
duke a little bit in the opening scene then her husband comes in 
and shes sent home 
she sang five roles that season and remembers best one 
performance as the fifth serving woman in elektra 
i loved that music she said i had several pages by 
myself it was really exciting she was covering that part 
meaning that she went on if the scheduled singer fell ill 
in her second season she sang barbarina in the marriage of 
figaro 
that was an important step forward for me upshaw said 
she has a little aria by herself there was more dramatic work on 
stage it was really my first time spent with met artistic 
director james levine i think thanks to barbarina he had enough 
confidence in me to offer other interesting roles he brought my 
singing to the public a little sooner than it would otherwise have 
been brought 
the biggest part she has had at the met was the female lead 
adina in the elixir of love two seasons ago 
i was covering kathy battle for a run of four upshaw said 
she canceled all of them the first one an hour before it began 
i was singing a smaller part in the opera i was leaving the 
apartment when i got a phone call saying she was sick and i would 
have to go on 
i remember trying to switch gears to the lead it was really 
terrifying some people thrive on that sort of thing their 
adrenaline gets going and theyre very animated and comfortable 
not having ever walked on the set before that night not having 
sung any bit of it with the orchestra i dont want to do that 
again i was not loose and carefree i was definitely stiff and 
nervous 
everything turned out ok especially by the third or fourth 
performance 
this season at the met upshaw will sing zerlina in don 
giovanni starting in march 
i was supposed to sing despina too in january she said 
i recently pulled out i wanted to give myself more time after 
the baby they were nice about it people are very understanding 
when its a baby

a scottish band called texas is bound to 
cause some confusion first of all the groups name comes from the 
film paris texas not the state 
also their music shows no trace of scottish roots drawing 
instead on the folk and blues of such americans as ry cooder and 
elmore james 
thats one reason their debut album southside took so long 
to make as singer sharleen spiteri explained finding a producer 
capable of understanding the viewpoints of four determined young 
musicians was nearly impossible 
we had the songs arranged for a long time and we really just 
needed someone to get us in the mood said spiteri 21 but the 
producers always wanted to add a few keyboards or even a saxophone 
we just believed in our sound we were very stubborn we 
welcomed suggestions but there were too many people it becomes 
the producer and record company on one side and the band on the 
other its like a conveyor belt ok this band wont get a record 
so well go the next band 
texas spiteri explained is willing to take orders but only if 
you ask nicely the members prefer sitting down and discussing 
ideas coming to decisions that reflect everyones input 
its a lot different from one person spiteri said with 
four people you get different ideas you get some interesting 
conversations maybe theyll change my mind on bits and pieces 
maybe ill change theirs its good we are a band thats able to 
talk 
they know how fortunate they are to just have a record growing 
up in glasgow unemployment was a stubborn fact of life from which 
music provided a cherished escape 
i came out of school and luckily enough got a job as a 
hairdresser spiteri said 
i started off with just a saturday job and then managed to get 
fulltime work a lot of people thought because i had such a secure 
job one that a lot of people in scotland would give their right 
arm for i was crazy to give it up for a career in music 
my dads unemployed guitarist ally mcerlaine said 
because of the class structure and everything its geared to 
keeping the working classes down and stopping people from getting 
anywhere you cant get a good job but for playing in a band we 
didnt have to have any sort of background 
texas was formed in the spring of 1987 when a friend introduced 
spiteri to bassist john mcelhone they quickly wrote i dont need 
a lover the albums first single which opens with a slide 
guitar influenced by cooders soundtrack for paris texas 
a lot of the people think the albums about old 
relationships said spiteri who cited linda ronstadt and patsy 
cline as influences 
i dont want a lover is malefemale but its also about 
everything thats happened to us the high unemployment in 
scotland the fact a lot of our family and friends are unemployed 
getting a record deal was surprisingly the easy part for 
texas who now had mcerlaine and drummer stuart kerr aboard the 
band signed with phonogram in england but making the album was an 
unwelcome lesson in the blues starting when the young group headed 
for america to work with producer bernard edwards the former 
bassist for chic 
it never got very far spiteri said we worked for a month 
and it was still very basic we came back very upset we were 
thinking how we spent so much money and so much time 
they eventually hooked up with tim palmer who had produced 
former led zeppelin singer robert plant among others 
it was quite a relief mcerlaine said we were getting on 
well and he was bringing more out of it he just let us do our 
thing there were a lot of battles working with other producers and 
we knew we had to try someone else 
everyone contributes to the songs usually written around a 
guitar riff or bass pattern 
ally will make changes and maybe ill change something and 
from that point well rehearse it and see what happens spiteri 
said over the past 2 years all the things that have happened 
forced us to put them into the songs the feelings brought on by 
all the producers and studios rubbed off 
prayer for you faith and the future is promises all 
reflect the groups struggle to make the record mcerlaine called 
that spirit a product of their upbringing the determination to 
work hard and not compromise 
spiteri talked of prayer for you and its words of 
encouragement i could never watch you suffer i could never let 
you down and i hope you soon discover all the truth that ive now 
found 
prayer for you was the last song we wrote for the album 
the singer recalled it was a very basic acoustic guitar and 
vocal that we took it into the studio and jammed on everything 
came out on it it was a relief 
everything was coming to a head at that point we had people 
saying oh god are they going to do it you felt that everybody 
was thinking can these people work with anyone else all these 
people were coming in with ideas but its not their record its 
ours

who was robert jay mathews the white supremacist 
who declared war on the united states and led a major terrorist 
campaign throughout the american west 
kevin flynn and gary gerhardt spent four years tracking his

of denver radio talk show host alan berg in a burst of machinegun 
fire in 1984 
it explores the underground groups thinking way of life and 
the passions that drove followers to rob armored cars blow up 
churches and take on the us government which they branded the 
zionist occupation government or zog for short 
its a tale of bravado and intrigue murder and passion 
it also details one of the widest most expensive criminal 
investigations since the patty hearst case by the time it ended 
there were 75 arrests in related cases and five deaths 
flynn and gerhardt reporters for the rocky mountain news said 
the silent brotherhood took its name from a poem in a history of 
adolf hitlers dreaded wafen ss the silent brotherhood laid 
elaborate plans to sabotage dams water supplies utilities and 
communications lines its goal was to transform five western states 
into an aryan nation free of black and jewish influence 
to finance their plan members robbed two banks in washington 
and launched a career of armored car heists that spread to 
california 
they set up a doomsday assassination squad if the group was 
attacked by authorities it planned to track and kill statesman 
henry kissinger banker david rockefeller and the heads of the 
three television networks all of whom were perceived as enemies 
because they were either jewish or worked for jews 
to prove their resolve they decided to send a message on june 
18 1984 they stalked and killed berg outside his denver home 
berg was killed because he was jewish and because he frequently 
attacked group members on his radio program with his acidtongued 
wit 
the funds from their robberies grew and included 38 million 
netted in a bold daylight highway robbery near ukiah calif this 
money was to be shared with other rightwing groups in the united 
states including the carolina knights of the kkk in north 
carolina the texas klan the white aryan resistance in california 
and the white supremacist group aryan nations 
the group made a major mistake by leaving behind a gun during a 
california heist and fbi agents tracked mathews to a home near 
seattle where he died in a hail of gunfire and flames during a 
36hour standoff 
the story doesnt end there in july 1986 at the aryan world 
congress mathews and his followers were honored with medals that 
read should you fall my friend another friend will emerge from 
the shadows to take your place 
in september 1986 a string of bombings took place in coeur 
dalene idaho by a group calling itself the silent brotherhood 
strike force ii 
among those who provided information to the authors were bruce 
pierce now serving time in an illinois prison who was convicted 
in november 1987 of violating alan bergs civil rights by killing 
him and zillah craig mathews lover who is now raising his 
daughter 
the book is remarkable for its details on groups that pride 
themselves on secrecy however it still fails to resolve the one 
central question why did they do it 
the authors attempt to explain it as part of the mountain 
man mystique and frontier spirit of the old west but that fails 
to explain the vast allure of groups such as these in the south 
with deep roots in the civil war 
flynn and gerhardt acknowledge they are not psychologists but 
say they wanted to provide some insight into why racists belong to 
such groups 
its simplistic and easy to put these guys in a jar on a shelf 
called nuts and not worry about it gerhardt said these were 
real people not a whole lot different than we are the difference 
is how they carried it out 
flynn said all supremacist groups have several things in common 
such as a charismatic leader what they view as a superpatriotic 
attitude and a shared goal of restoring the united states not 
destroying it 
in the end the best clue to the thinking of such groups comes 
from mathews himself who cheated the fbi out of a chance for 
interrogation by choosing death 
shortly before he died mathews gathered the group together and 
asked them to sign a declaration of war against society 
we the following being of sound mind and under no duress do 
hereby sign this document of our own free will stating 
forthrightly and without fear that we declare ourselves to be in 
full and unrelenting state of war with those forces seeking and 
consciously promoting the destruction of our faith and our race 
while facing dozens of heavily armed agents holed up in a house 
with a small armory mathews was asked what it would take for him 
to surrender 
i want parts of eastern washington idaho and montana set 
aside as an aryan homeland he said 
in his suicide note mathews could only muse as to why the white 
fbi agents could turn against one of their own race it serves as 
an epitaph for his paramilitary organization betrayed in the end 
to federal agents by two of his own men 
white men killing white men saxon killing dane 
when will it end the aryans bane

ibm is offering early retirement to 1000 of its 
employees bordens plan to reorganize its dairy operations will 
cost 7000 jobs and the megabuyout of rjr nabisco will result in 
more than 1600 layoffs 
business optimism appears to be dimming and manufacturers are 
becoming more aggressive in cutting costs and people but a 
relatively steady unemployment rate which has fluctuated between 
51 percent and 53 percent since april means somebody is hiring 
the question is who 
steven haugen an economist with the bureau of labor statistics 
says job growth is concentrated in the service sector that broad 
amorphous category covering everything from data processing to 
theme parks to the neighborhood beauty parlor experts say this 
sector is creating upwards of 15 million jobs a year 
services is very labor intensive so its sucking up all the 
workers said john hekman a senior economist at the claremont 
economics institute in claremont calif 
in september alone when the loss of 103000 manufacturing jobs 
inched the unemployment rate up 01 percent to 53 percent service 
industries added 317000 jobs a closer look however shows 
teachers returning to their classrooms and the ending of a 
telephone workers strike were responsible for much of the job 
increase 
but economists point to health care providers temporary help 
agencies hotels and the entertainment industry as being among the 
most consistent net adders of employees 
the health care industry is growing at just under 10 percent a 
year said geoffrey fenton a spokesman for baxter international a 
major medical supplies manufacturer in deerfield ill 
baxter added 2400 jobs in 1988 and fenton said the payroll 
continues to grow this year revenue grew 10 percent last year and 
sales were up significantly so far this year he said 
orders to the 6000 to 7000 hospitals baxter supplies are 
increasing as an aging population requires more medical care but 
the fastest growing area of new business for baxter lies in the 
sale of alternatesite products like intravenous solutions and 
dialysis items used at home and in nursing homes overall 
outpatient care is growing at the rate of about 20 percent 
annually said hekman 
on the temporary help scene manpower inc chief executive 
mitchell fromstein characterized growth as meteoric over the 
last five years since the beginning of this year fromstein said 
manpowers permanent staff has increased by 1000 employees 
were increasing the number of offices we operate by 10 
percent a year and we will do at least that going forward he 
said from the companys headquarters in milwaukee 
were adding more offices because we can do more business 
said fromstein who noted that the number of people employed 
temporarily has tripled since 1982 
on the entertainment and recreation front the theme park 
business is hot walt disney co has added about 4000 people to 
its payroll with the opening of three new attractions at disney 
world in orlando fla disneymgm studios typhoon lagoon water 
park and a nighttime entertainment section said spokesman erwin 
okun 
in addition to hiring people to staff the new attractions okun 
said increased attendance bolstered by an influx of foreign 
tourists flush with cash thanks to favorable exchange rates has 
spurred disney to create new jobs 
mca inc is investing 600 million in a universal studios movie 
park that will compete directly with disney when it opens in the 
spring 
on the west coast mgm grand inc announced plans this month to 
build a 700 million movie theme park in las vegas that will employ 
7000 people when it opens tentatively in late 1992 
the lodging industry is also expanding nationwide in the 12 
months ended in june 60000 new hotel jobs had been created 
hekman said 
hyatt corp the chicagobased hotel chain is adding 3000 
positions this year because of expansion and acquisitions said 
spokeswoman carrie reckert 
although the loss of manufacturing jobs concerns many 
economists in part because service sector jobs tend to pay less 
than industrial work others dont see this as a severe problem 
they say the manufacturing process has become more efficient and 
fewer workers are required 
we shouldnt be concerned if manufacturing is not growing 
because were having a 5 percent annual increase in output per 
worker hekman said 
but the service sector has shown very little productivity gains 
so as the economy grows were moving people out of 
highproductivity areas and moving them into the services he 
said

dealers said londons financial community was beginning to 
consider that another rise in rates now at 15 percent might be a 
possibility 
some commentators said the pound was put under renewed pressure 
by weekend press speculation that a rift had emerged over 
management of the economy between prime minister margaret thatcher

at about 1215 pm the financial timesstock exchange

the anglofrench consortium which is building the 
31mile rail tunnel under the english channel said monday it will 
cost substantially more to build the link between england and 
france 
the consortium eurotunnel said the tunnel would cost 7 billion 
pounds about 11 billion or 44 percent more than predicted two 
years ago largely because of higher than anticipated costs for 
rail cars 
eurotunnel cochairman alastair morton said last week that the 
group would have to raise more funds to meet the higher costs and 
that it was embroiled in a cost dispute with its major contractor 
transmanchelink which was pegging costs between 5 percent and 10 
percent higher 
morton said monday he was sure those difficulties would be 
sorted out and that talks with tml were polite and constructive 
contrary to weekend reports that suggested otherwise 
there is no longer a question of should the project be built 
its going ahead the cochairman said we would never request 
government assistance and their answer would be no anyway 
eurotunnel said it raised its revenue projections by 7 percent 
for the year 2003 to 8195 million pounds or 129 billion from 
7684 million pounds and by 8 percent for the year 2013 to 9974 
million pounds from 9231 million pounds 
eurotunnel shares which have fallen sharply since the higher 
costs were announced were off 33 pence or 52 cents at 535 pence 
on londons stock exchange monday morning 
morton said the proposed british rail highspeed rail link 
joining london with the tunnel needed to be completed as quickly 
as possible to avoid serious congestion on existing networks 
on the tunnel work itself eurotunnel reported that the boring 
machines had not yet reached satisfactory production rate but 
that modifications were being made 
working from both sides of the channel workers have dug about 
half of a service tunnel but construction of two other tunnels 
which will carry trains in opposite directions has a long way to 
go eurotunnel says it will complete the project by mid1993

a top iraqi oil official said his 
countrys new extra production capacity will be used only if opec 
agreements collapse the middle east economic survey reported 
monday 
ramzi salman head of the state oil marketing organization told 
the weekly newsletter that iraqs new oil capacity will help to 
make people think twice before violating the agreement 
a year ago we did not have that flexibility or that potential 
but now we have it and should there be a political decision to use 
it we can use it salman said 
he said iraq could now export more than 4 million barrels a day 
well over its organization of petroleum exporting countries daily 
quota of 292 million barrels for the last quarter of this year 
export capacity will be developed to bigger volumes and i 
dont think producing 4 million barrels is a problem he said 
he stressed iraqs continued commitment to the opec agreements 
and its desire for firm oil prices adding we are not interested 
in lower prices revenue maximization is the objective 
the comments by salman were carried in an interview published by 
the nicosiabased newsletter 
his warning came at a time when the cartels 13 member nations 
are exceeding their production limits under the opec agreement 
the international energy agency said in its monthly oil market 
report last week that opec pumped about 223 million barrels of 
crude a day in september the same as in august while the 
production ceiling was set at 195 million 
the cartel has decided to boost production by 1 million barrels 
a day for the last quarter of the year raising its overall stated 
production to 205 million this is still nearly 2 million lower 
that the actual augustseptember production level 
the average price of oil has hovered around 1682 a barrel as 
monitored by opec in the last week of september compared to opecs 
target of 18 
iraqs increased export capacity followed the completion of a 
second phase of a pipeline across saudi arabia to the red sea port 
of yanbu raising the lines capacity to 165 million barrels a day 
that is in addition to a pipeline through turkey to the 
mediterranean that also can carry 165 million barrels a day and 
the reopening of the al bakr terminal on the persian gulf 
the terminal was damaged during the eightyear war with iran but 
50 percent of its original capacity has been restored and it now 
can handle at least 800000 barrels a day salman said

economists are increasingly wary of federal 
government economic data says walter j williams an independent 
analyst with a specialty in forecasting interest rates for 
institutional clients 
querying 113 of his brethren at a meeting of the national 
association of business economists recently he found 72 percent of 
them werent happy with the quality of data many said it was 
deteriorating 
its worth noting and perhaps a little frightening he 
observes that the greatest skepticism was directed at numbers that 
generally are given the most weight by financial decisionmakers 
he says that because he found his colleagues especially 
skeptical about the bureau of economic analysis which issues the 
gross national product figures and the bureau of the census whose 
numbers include retail sales 
he did not offer the example that follows but it probably 
serves as well as any to illustrate what he is talking about 
the illustration relates to economic conditions during midyear 
1986 when much of the country was experiencing economic problems 
on july 22 of that year the government reported that 
secondquarter gnp had grown at a 11 percent rate down sharply 
from a firstquarter rate of just under 4 percent the economy was 
still expanding it said but sluggishly 
one year later on july 24 1987 the report was revised to show 
a gain of only 06 percent after still another revision on july 
27 1988 the tiny 06 percent growth was turned into an 08 
percent decline 
the revisions continued on july 27 1989 a full percentage 
point was added to the 08 percent decline making for a 
substantial 18 percent shrinkage of gross national product for 
the second quarter of 1986 
it wasnt the only revision gnp for the third quarter of 1986 
initially reported as growth of 14 percent also was revised 
downward it became 1 percent in 1988 and only 08 percent in the 
1989 revision 
should the pattern of downward revisions continue next year in 
the summer of 1990 it will mean that way back in 1986 the united 
states economy was in recession two backtoback quarters of gnp 
shrinkage defines recession 
one critic of the governments gnp numbers doubts that it will 
take place albert sindlinger a pioneer in economic measurements 
says it would be very embarrassing in 1990 to tell america it had 
a recession four years earlier 
he has a special interest in the changing numbers because based 
on data he had assembled and distributed to clients at the time 31 
states making up 495 percent of the us population were in 
recession in the second quarter of 1986 
the recession states associated with minerals heavy industry 
farming oil and lumber knew they were in recession he said but 
much of the country had no idea in the national numbers coastal 
booms offset the negatives 
more than embarrassing in all this is the fact that important 
personal business and governmental business was affected by the 
incorrect government numbers 
decisions are made within seconds of the initial announcements 
once made those decisions forever skew the economys path they 
cannot be revised 
there may be no easy way to correct the problem perhaps most of 
the revisions made in economic data result from additional 
information unavailable earlier economic information must be 
timely it is perishable 
economists interviewed by williams who operates under the name 
american business econometrics seemed to suggest that personnel 
improvements might help eightytwo percent of them agreed that 
insufficient funding and staffing were causes of poor quality more 
than half cited datagathering techniques 
a washington environment that often leads to politicaleconomic 
clashes was all but absolved of blame relatively few economists 
said williams believe the quality of federal numbers is damaged by 
political manipulation

million or 21 cents per share in the three months ended sept 30 
compared with 236 million or 25 cents per share a year earlier 
thirdquarter revenue rose to 1278 million from 1123 million 
a year earlier 
subscriptions to the companys services continue to grow 
although its us business has been hurt by problems in the thrift 
industry which is among its groups of customers said neil s 
hirsch president and chief executive of telerate 
he said earnings were depressed in the third quarter by costs of 
introduction of the foreign exchange trading service from global 
transactions 
expenses will continue at a relatively high level through the 
balance of 1989 hirsch said and should continue to affect 
earnings for the rest of the year but should moderate later as the 
service generates more revenue

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
monday on the chicago board of trade as traders reacted to word the 
weekend saw the biggest harvest of the season 
november and january soybeans drifted to contract lows in light 
trading reflecting the harvest news 
adding pressure to prices was speculation by traders that the 
us department of agricultures crop report due out thursday will 
contain an upward revision of the crop production estimate said 
william biedermann an analyst with allendale inc in chicago 
corn prices were pressured by the belief there will be little 
additional business from the soviet union the usda announced late 
friday that the soviets have purchased 11 million metric tons of 
corn 
there is little prospect of more business from the soviet union 
biedermann said 
wheat prices were undermined by the dashing of rumors that the 
soviets would buy us wheat it appears the soviets would instead 
try to rely on domestic production analysts said 
the absence of many traders because of the yom kippur and 
columbus day holidays tended to depress prices according to 
analysts 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 5 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 406 a bushel corn was 3 
cents to 4 cents lower with december at 235 a bushel oats were 
2 cents to 3 cents lower with december at 140 a bushel 
soybeans were 5 cents to 11 cents lower with november at 556 a

representatives from mgmua 
communications co and australias qintex group continued 
discussions monday in an attempt to get qintexs stalled 15 
billion takeover bid for mgmua back on track 
the deal was placed in jeopardy last week when mgmua revealed 
that qintex failed to make a scheduled 50 million down payment 
qintex an australian resorts and entertainment company was to 
have delivered the irrevocable letter of credit for 50 million by 
sept 22 one week after qintex outbid media mogul rupert murdoch 
for mgmua by 100 million 
daniel saks a spokesman for qintex said negotiations over the 
letter of credit had taken place over the weekend and continued 
monday 
he said the talks involved a renegotiation of the letter of 
credit which is in essence a nonrefundable deposit but saks 
described as inaccurate a report monday in the wall street journal 
which said mgmua was seeking to increase the amount of the letter 
of credit to 100 million 
mgmua spokeswoman mary hardy said she was unable to make any 
statement beyond that contained in the companys announcement 
thursday of the missed deadline 
mgmua chairman jeffrey c barbakow was off for the holiday a 
secretary said kevin wallace qintexs chief financial officer 
was also out of the office for the day his secretary said 
the protracted negotiations rekindled speculation that qintex 
might be unable to afford the planned purchase qintex officials 
have said repeatedly that its financing will come in part from a 
group of 10 asian and european investors none of whom have been 
identified publicly 
in a release issued late thursday mgmua said the qintex letter 
of credit had yet to arrive it added that the companies were 
talking about modifying their merger agreement concerning 
appropriate security from qintex 
no change was contemplated in the merger price the mgmua 
statement said 
earlier last week qintex chairman christopher c skase assured 
the brisbane stock exchange that qintex had arranged the 
security for the 50 million letter of credit mgmua said qintex 
had advised it that security had been posted in a bank 
jeffrey logsdon an analyst at the investment firm of crowell 
weedon and co said last month that a major studio needs 300 
million in capital each year to sustain production and 
distribution logsdon said qintex needs to accumulate two years of 
operating capital or 600 million on top of the 15 billion 
purchase price 
in buying mgmua qintex will also assume 400 million of mgmua 
junkbond debt including logsdons production estimates that 
would mean that qintex will end up spending 25 billion to acquire 
and operate mgmua

trading monday after a published report said a major stockholder 
steinhardt partners was buying more shares and looking into other 
options aimed at raising the companys stock price 
michael h steinhardt a new york money manager whose firm owns 
83 percent of the arlington va based usair group has hired 
wall street investment banker wertheim schroder amp co to explore

stock exchange on monday rising 362 a share to 5225 on volume 
of 165 million shares

onetime costs related to its recent merger with piedmont airlines 
chairman edwin i colodny said in addition he said hurricane hugo 
disrupted the usair system in the southeast

involving large stockholder dividends are among the options

a firm led by billionaire investor warren buffett that stock could 
be converted to at least a 12 percent stake in the company in two

a state judge has refused to block a 
lawsuit against general dynamics corp which claimed it was immune 
from the suit under national security laws 
stamford superior court judge nicholas a cioffi said in his 
decision which was filed friday and released monday that only the 
federal government not a private party could invoke national 
security privileges to protect itself from lawsuits 
norden systems a subsidiary of hartfordbased united 
technologies corp sued general dynamics in april after norden was 
dropped from a topsecret program to develop a new generation of 
navy jet fighters 
general dynamics based in st louis is the prime contractor 
for the 4 billion advanced tactical aircraft program it had 
awarded a 114 million subcontract to norden in january 1988 to 
develop an inair radar system for the jet fighter 
general dynamics said it canceled the contract because it was 
dissatisfied with nordens work 
norden based in norwalk claims it is owed at least 39 million 
for the work it did on the radar system it also claims its 
reputation was damaged by the cancellation and that hundreds of 
jobs also were eliminated as a result 
norden is seeking damages in excess of 15000 in its lawsuit 
under connecticut law plaintiffs can only specify ranges of 
damages they are seeking not a specific amount 
general dynamics argued in court last month that it cant be 
sued because the contract dispute involves a topsecret project 
company attorney herbert fenster of washington dc said that to 
defend itself general dynamics would have to publicly release 
topsecret documents fenster said the release of such documents 
would compromise national security 
norden contends it can prove its case without using topsecret 
documents 
general dynamics also argued that the superior court lacks 
jurisdiction over the matter cioffi also rejected that claim 
saying this court does have subject matter jurisdiction to 
entertain the instant case which is a contract action 
fenster wasnt in his office monday and couldnt be reached for 
a comment according to a secretary 
norden spokesman scott brinckerhoff said were pleased that 
this obstacle has been removed and the case can go forward 
the navy has not intervened in the dispute it has asked only 
that national secrets not be disclosed

soichiro honda the founder of the 
japanese automaker that bears his name dropped by the henry ford 
museum on monday and recalled the day he first saw an automobile 
a model t he chased down a japanese road when he was 6 
every time that ford car stopped it left a little bit of an 
oil slick underneath and i smelled that oil slick i enjoyed it 
thoroughly and i still remember very vividly the kind of enjoyment 
i had by smelling that oil slick the 82yearold honda said 
in addition to the museum visit where he received a plaque 
honda was in the detroit area to be inducted tuesday into the 
automotive hall of fame 
he talked to reporters in front of a 1983 honda accord with a 
serial number 001 the first car to be made at the companys 
marysville ohio assembly plant 
his company was followed by other japanese automakers in 
establishing assembly plants in the united states toyota motor 
corp mazda motor corp and nissan motor corp each have wholly 
owned plants on us soil 
mitsubishi motors corp is linked with chrysler corp in a joint 
venture and fuji heavy industries inc and isuzu motors ltd own a 
plant to make subaru cars and isuzu trucks 
later this year honda begins production at its second us 
plant in east liberty ohio honda will make civic and accord cars 
at the two plants 
but honda has steered clear of linking itself with a us 
automaker it has a production agreement with the british automaker 
austin rover maker of sterling cars for the us market 
the companys founder declined to speculate on whether the 
company would join forces with any other company in the united 
states that never happened during my generation and i cannot 
answer what is going to happen in the future he said 
honda began his auto career in a tokyo repair shop at the age of 
16 in the 1930s he became involved in racing and in 1937 he 
formed a small piston ring company 
he formed honda motor co in 1948 and began producing bicycles 
the company entered the auto industry in 1963 and became a us 
manufacturer just less than 20 years later 
honda has no formal role with the company he founded i 
retired from honda motor company 16 years ago im currently 
unemployed 
yet his passion for cars and the way they work continues 
what i would really like to do even today is mess up my hands 
and work in grease he said

shearson lehman hutton inc said monday 
it will close its australian interbank foreign exchange financial 
futures and stock brokerage activities 
the new yorkbased investment house said the restructuring is 
part of a shakeout among australian stock brokerages and 
foreignexchange institutions which are suffering from 
continuing increased competition and shrinking profit margins 
an increase in the number of foreign commercial banks 
investment banks and brokerages here has exacerbated the 
competition for business in the financial industry 
it was decided we would be far better to focus our resources 
in the areas in which we can provide the most added value to 
clients from a local base and to move out of the australian 
interbank foreign exchange market and australiansourced broking 
areas ken allen chairman of shearsons australian operations 
said in a statement monday 
allen said the refocusing follows a review of shearsons 
worldwide operations 
we will service the foreign exchange us equity and 
financial futures requirements of our institutional clients from 
our major locations in new york tokyo and london allen said 
that appears to be the most appropriate course of action given 
the preference of larger institutions to look for advice directly 
from the offshore capital markets 
the company said about 20 sales and trading employees will be 
offered a severance package or relocation 
shearson which is majority owned by american express co 
started business in australia in 1987
